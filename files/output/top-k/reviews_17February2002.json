I think Kathleen Robertson was beautiful and played the role right.  She was the highlight.  She could've easily been over-dramatic and cheesy, but she wasn't.  Kudos.  She must've learned something from 90210.  The story should've been more about the relationship and the struggle to make it work and more sociology, but throwing the pregnancy and that movie director guy into it were just huge, uncreative cop-outs in telling the story.  The writer should be ashamed. ","genre":null},{"date":"17 February 2002","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  Um, this movie wasn't so good.
