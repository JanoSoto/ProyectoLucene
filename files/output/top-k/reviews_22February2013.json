The play is credible and moving without becoming sentimental. It was a pleasant surprise, that the story is also a portrayal of the bitter poverty among marginalized workers (perhaps working poor sounds more familiar). It is at least as much a drama about social conditions as a love tale. Many scenes unfold in a cookie factory. To a large extent the personal problems originate from the drawbacks of the society. Some people just don't get true opportunities. It's amazing there on the shady side. Nonetheless, the script also dives deep into the personal characters. The result is satisfying, considering that empathy comes naturally. Can I present any hidden layers or meanings in this review? That depends on what you want to see. I advise to look more than once (an intention not yet proved by myself). I would not be surprised if on a closer examination the narrative is quite ambivalent. Just an example which stands out near the end Stanley gets an excellent job in another state. Yes, again the American dream turns into reality! Amazing, you never get fed up with it.

There's a lot that say that this is a great movie, and most I see say this because it is very sentimental, and there are a few that say this is an annoying and poor movie, because of what they see from it. Both may be right, I don't pretend to be the know all of answers. I just have my opinion. To those who love this movie because it is sentimental and powerfully overwhelming, it's true. First time I saw this movie a fear tears leaked out here and there, but I think there's a lot more under the surface here. More depth than just a sentimental movie. If you think about it, shoes make many appearances in this movie. In the very beginning Gump talks about his very first pair of shoes, ones that limited his mobility and left him vulnerable. As those broke away (albeit in a very cheesy way) he got new shoes, ones that allowed him to run away from danger and run to success, in the form of football. This allows him to graduate from University, which, one might say, is part of the American dream. But that is a whole other side to the movie. He joins the war, and while he's there he runs from danger, acting the hero by saving lives. When he leaves, he runs into a man who has no shoes, mainly because he has no legs. Lieutenant Dan, now a cripple, is bitter and angry because he cannot walk, and he is limited both in his ability to move and go places as well as limited in his ability to see beyond anything in life other than when he should have died. When Gump and Dan start the fishing company, Lieutenant Dan realizes the importance of life, (once again, cheesy) and he swims off. We don't see him for a while. Annndd Gump gets bored. So he runs, all across America (part of American dream, to travel?...) He returns home, Jenny comes back, random scenes occur blah blah blah and we come back to Gump's wedding. Lieutenant Dan comes back! He has legs, even! And with his legs he has a beautiful fiancée. I'll skip the rest. Yes there are random side stories of his life that are cheesy or don't contribute to the movie, but those are fun and lively, if a little unrealistic. Ping-pong? Hah! This is only one part of the numerous layers that make up this movie. A satire of the American dream, viewing American history through innocent and unbiased eyes, a description of life even! This movie is powerful in its complexity, and intricate in its depth. And yes, it is sentimental and fun to watch as well. To those who critique it for the ignorance is bliss view, perhaps look a little closer. This movie is not saying that one can succeed by doing nothing but being lucky, (though that is the end result, so I see how you can believe that) but is looking back through all the things I mentioned just before in a unique and entertaining way. Gump views the world as he walks through it, wearing whatever pair of shoes, doing whatever it is he's doing. He watches events as they occur, and he participates in them in his own way. He shows, through his simple-minded example, that you do not need to be brilliant or manipulative, or even fully functional in order to succeed.

This movie is still captivating people everywhere over 15 years after its original release. If one is searching for a solely historical account of the Titanic sinking, then this is not the movie for them. While tying in key historical elements, Cameron has stated that Titanic was not meant to be a historical account but a love story. He does a wonderful job of combining the tragedy of the sinking and the story of forbidden lovers, but some historical events are not included. For example, many reviewers ask why Cameron did not include the Californinan shutting of its radio for the night. This scene was in fact filmed but then cut due to Cameron feeling that If Titanic is powerful as a metaphor, as a microcosm for the end of the world in a sense, then that world must be self contained. However, if you are looking for a beautiful, heart wrenching love story with a historical setting, this is the movie for you. You can't help but to be swept up in the elegance of the period. The costumes and sets are lavish for the upper class and realistically drab for those of the lower class. The dialogue is excellent, seamlessly creating a beautiful story line. The special effects used along with gorgeous camera work produce shots upon shots of heart stopping images. Winslet and DiCaprio have undeniable chemistry and are extremely convincing in their roles of wealthy and poor, respectively.Overall, this film is a must see classic for people of all ages.

For example, many reviewers ask why Cameron did not include the Californinan shutting of its radio for the night. This scene was in fact filmed but then cut due to Cameron feeling that If Titanic is powerful as a metaphor, as a microcosm for the end of the world in a sense, then that world must be self contained. However, if you are looking for a beautiful, heart wrenching love story with a historical setting, this is the movie for you. You can't help but to be swept up in the elegance of the period. The costumes and sets are lavish for the upper class and realistically drab for those of the lower class. The dialogue is excellent, seamlessly creating a beautiful story line. The special effects used along with gorgeous camera work produce shots upon shots of heart stopping images. Winslet and DiCaprio have undeniable chemistry and are extremely convincing in their roles of wealthy and poor, respectively.Overall, this film is a must see classic for people of all ages.

I was hyped out of my skull, because I had a vision of it that seemed pretty awesome. I bought it. Although the film never reached my vision, it passed it in quality. Alien was pretty awesome, but Aliens was without a doubt amazing. Let's break down the movie in several aspects of film making.1. Acting Acting from all sides was excellent. The film gave proper focus to whoever needed it at the time. My personal favorite actress for the movie was not Weaver, despite her being my favorite actress of all time, but Jennette Goldstein for her amazing role as Vasquez. She was perfect in her role, and she brought a somewhat bad-girl vibe to the film whenever needed. I've seen bad girls in movies like Rain from Resident Evil, who kinda sucked. She tried to be Vasquez. Vasquez was Vasquez. And then you have the calm yet willing Hicks who is played well by Michael Beihn, who can play anyone he wants. Bill Paxton did a completely realistic job as the obnoxious, seemingly tough but truly frightful Hudson. Lance Henriksen (One of my favorite actors) played an android almost as well as Ian Holm (also one of my favorite actors) did in the original Alien film. Whoa. And of course, Weaver and Carrie Henn made a lovable pair as a daughter-less mother and an orphan as Ripley and Newt. So heartfelt.2. Character Development. Acting can be good, but when you watch a movie with characters, don't you want to see how the characters got to be the way they were or how their attitudes will turn out in the later moments of the film? That's what Aliens had plenty of. I won't give spoilers, but that may take the character development out. Just know this Ellen Ripley is strong but caring, and somewhat scarred; Newt is a clever and scared girl; Bill Paxton is Bill Paxton at his finest; Lance Henrisken is almost emotionless in a pleasant manner; Vasquez is one of the toughest ladies in 80's films; and Burke is a businessman.3. Cinematography. Aliens had nearly perfect cinematography. Camera angles were met from unforgettable and perfect sides throughout the original cut and the directors cut. Unforgettable.5. Score. A good score can be a good score, but there's the matter of putting separate vibes with the scenes going on. The music needs to mix with the movie. Whenever Aliens was creepy, the music made it perfectly creepy. When it was at a good, clean, touching point, the music was a bit touching. Perfect.6. Story. A story needs a lack of hokeyness throughout. It needs no, I repeat, no predictability or last second moments. Aliens had touched on a lack of hokeyness in its original cut quite well. I won't give off any examples to avoid spoilers. Everything added up well and had no continuity errors. Not to mention, for an action\/sci-fi movie with terrorizing undertones, Aliens was perfectly creepy, despite not being seen as a horror movie sometimes.7. Scenery. A movie needs to have convincing scenery that matches the vibe of the movie. Given the creepy and dark vibes the movie gives off regarding the dreary desolated environment that sci-fi movies love to use, the detail put into the buildings and planet was unbelievably good.8. Direction. A story can be bad, and a story can be good. How well you're to direct that story plays a big part in critical perspective. Take THX 1138 for example. Lame story, great direction. Direction, is some combination of how well you put every aspect together to work as a team. Aliens worked the music, acting, cinematography, etc., in ways that were so memorable that Alien is truly one of the greatest films ever made. I love Aliens, and I do believe if they decide to reboot the series from after Aliens, I'll be super hyped.

The characters and story are engaging, the movie is directed and written almost perfectly and overall, the movie is very comedic in its tone but also serious, with two such opposing tones mixing together perfectly!

The casting for the film is absolutely spot on,as every character is played with complete conviction and credibility.

From Tony Bennett's Rags To Riches to Derek and The Dominoes' Layla, each song is combined perfectly to comment on the actions in the film.The screenplay for the movie, based on Nicolas Pileggi's book Wiseguy is completely flawless, gripping and intense throughout, keeping the audience fixated on how the characters are going to respond or take action next.Personally, for me this is Martin Scorsese's best film and one of my favourite films, it captures the life of this young boy turned gangster perfectly with iconic scenes again and again, making it a memorable spectacle to watch.

TOP GUN contains many flaws but at the same time there's no way you can deny the fact that it's rather entertaining, features a terrific cast and of course it turned Cruise into a major Hollywood star. We'll start with the negative stuff first. The biggest problem is without question the screenplay, which is just way too predictable for its own good. I mean, there are several twists in the story but there's not a single scene that you won't see coming from a mile away. We're introduced to a hot shot, we learn about his sad past, we see him fall for a strong woman (Kelly McGillis), we see him lose strong woman, we see a tragedy, we see him give up and of course we haven't even gotten to the predictable ending. I'm not saying the story had to be something hard-hitting or ground-breaking but there's no question that something not so predictable would have been good. As for the good stuff, you certainly can't overlook the terrific action scenes that are perfectly directed by Tony Scott. The director really makes you feel as if you're on board one of these jets and there's no question that there's some tense action throughout. Another major plus is that the cast is simply terrific as there are so many future stars here. Cruise, as you'd expect, has no problem playing the hot shot who soon starts to question what everyone is saying about him. You also have Kilmer turning in a good supporting part, although you have to wonder if he really wanted to be doing this character. Anthony Edwards, Tim Robbins, Meg Ryan, Michael Ironside and Tom Skerritt add nice support as well. I thought McGillis wasn't the typical actress you'd find in a romance like this but there's no question that she's good in the part. The soundtrack is full of B summer hits that add a little camp value. TOP GUN certainly isn't a perfect film but at least it's entertaining and as I said, it's always fun see so many stars in early roles.

The bad overwhelms the good most of the time--except of course a very cute and virile leading man, Christopher Reeve. He's supported well by Christopher Plummer in the second half of the film, and it's fun to see Teresa Wright in a small role (at the age of only 62, but she plays an older woman).Lots of the film has lingering moments of longing or wishing or letting the lens fog up a bit (literally it seems). It's incredibly slow overall, and sometimes even predictable. The two giant twists are of course meant to be wild and they are. They probably make the trip worthwhile, but keep some perspective on it as you go.The filming interested me because I've been to the location many times--the little resort of Mackinaw Island, Michigan. The hotel is actually the Grand Hotel as the signs say in the film. The one big difference overall is there are no cars on the island, and here there are a couple (but just two or three that I could see--they didn't totally overrun the place during filming). The hotel is a wooden wonder, and largely still intact as shown thirty years ago. I remember signs about a dress code in the dining room after a certain hour. And yet there was the water and the lawns and a king of summer paradise, too. And the porch--the longest in the world (over 600 feet)--is really a sight, with its grand high ceiling as well.I see the movie gets a good star rating and good for it. I think it has such romantic appeal, like a lower quality Affair to Remember, it rises above it's critical weaknesses. Watch accordingly.
