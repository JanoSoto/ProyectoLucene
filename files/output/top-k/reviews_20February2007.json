Paul's relationship with his trophy wife Camille disintegrates as she feels abandoned by him to Prokosh's advances, and sees him subdue himself to these great men.It is about film-making - of course! - it is about the plight of the artist, but where it succeeds most is in the carefully examined slow destruction of Camille and Paul's marriage. Raoul Coutard's cinemascope photography, filled with lush colors, only serves to highlight how little Paul is and how out of his depth he is. He and his wife hide it in different manners Paul by trying to assert intellectual superiority over his wiser-than-she-appears wife, therefor earning her contempt. She hides by relying on her sensuality.Godard typically references his love for film in a way that many will find pedantic, and the lush score isn't always wisely used, overwhelming and sometimes even obtrusive. But thankfully, Godard's message and cast survive the director's pseudo-intellectual short-comings. Bardot is perfectly cast as the ignorant innocent who strives to appear and be smarter than she is (even sporting a brunette whig at some point, in what is really a sad moment of self-loathing), but fails. Camille never convinces when she speaks, but the pain in those eyes is intensely real. Picoli's Paul is easier to sympathize with, as the reasonable whose every move to please anyone dooms him further. It is a cruel lesson and warning about relationships.The film also serves a more sarcastic and amusing (and far more conscious) duel between Palance's Prokosh, superbly vulgar and dramatic, and Lang, who becomes a wise and immensely charismatic figure that stands against compromise. It is sad that this was the German master's only performance in front of the camera.Le Mépris is slow, and if you get caught too much in Goddard's referencing and hyper-stylization, it will bore you. But if you really follow these characters, you're in for a unique, edifying and sometimes unnervingly uncomfortable ride.Must be seen several times under different angles to be fully appreciated.

Even naming it as a good film would be a decidedly generous assessment. There is extremely little character development. Adrian (Talia Shire) and Paulie (Burt Young), unlike in the first two films (and to a certain extent, the third one), are given very little to do, and the film never attempts to further explore their relationship with Rocky. In fact, Paulie is basically relegated to a clichéd comic-relief character.However, I really am surprised to find myself saying that 'Rocky IV' does contain a few fine moments, most particularly Rocky's training montage in Russia, intercut with the arduous exercise routine of his opponent. It appears that, in order to emerge victorious, Rocky has returned to nature. Whilst Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren) runs on a treadmill in a stuffy training studio, Rocky jogs through the open air of the Russian wilderness; whilst Drago lifts a hefty weights bar, Rocky lifts a wagon; whilst Drago pumps himself full of steroids, Rocky shovels down spoonfuls of spinach. This montage, set to the inspirational tune of a Survivor song I can't remember, culminates in a genuinely spectacular aerial shot of Rocky standing victorious at the peak of a snowy mountain, the glorious sun beaming behind him as he shouts his opponent's name in readiness.The final boxing match is cartoonish, over-the-top and ultimately everything we've come to expect from a 'Rocky' film. It is also somewhat amusing to witness how Rocky manages to single-handedly win over a stadium full of fiercely patriotic Russian communists through his remarkable American courage and dogged determination. From the moment the fight begins, we already know that Rocky is going to win, but that is beside the point. We just want to be there to cheer him on.
