On the very first page, she warns the reader, via an epigraph from Hawthorne, that the writer of a romance can get away with stuff (paraphrasing here) that a regular novelist can't. After the trail goes cold, she summons up two huge honking coincidences to keep our young scholars on the case. In the novel a goddess ex machina&#x97;specifically an American lesbian cultural-studies prof&#x97;turns up with a crucial journal, and in the film you have to be paying pretty close attention to figure out why they're in France all of a sudden; later on, Eckhart's character just happens to overhear the baddies plotting their next move. Despite a few rough patches like this, I'd still recommend the film to fans of the novel; not sure what others will make of it.

This movie managed to keep me so engaged from start to finish and has certainly cemented its place amongst the greatest movies in the mystery thriller genre.Rear Window is about a photographer, LB Jefferies (James Stewart), who after breaking his leg in an accident is confined to a wheelchair in his apartment. Therefore, he has grown quite stubborn and frustrated. He has a therapist, named Stella (Thelma Ritter) treating him and a young and beautiful socialite girlfriend named Lisa (Grace Kelly) whom he is not keen to marry. In this seemingly boring life, he spends his time by looking at his neighbors through his window. One night, he hears a woman screaming and sees a man exit from the house where he heard it. Throughout the night, the same man is seeing entering and exiting his home making mysterious trips. This is enough to make him suspicious. Tension grows when in the morning; the man is seen cleaning a knife and saw in his house. Jeff is convinced that he has killed his wife. I do not want to spoil what happens next.One element that makes this movie intriguing is the absolutely brilliant cinematography. The whole crowded neighborhood is wonderfully captured by the eye of the camera. All the neighbors seem to be so close to each other. Throughout the movie, the camera occasionally moves around the neighborhood slowly moving from house to house, introducing us to new characters. A woman who is always exercising, a songwriter, a lonely and desperate woman, to name a few. This only adds to the mysterious feel of the movie. Alfred Hitchcock's direction makes us feel something is wrong but we don't know what and that leaves our eyes glued to the movie. The soundtrack was complementary to the cinematography, adding to the beautiful cinematic portrayal of the mysterious atmosphere.I have to compliment Thelma Ritter, Grace Kelly and especially James Stewart who gives a stellar performance as Jefferies. You could literally feel the desperation in him on unraveling the mystery.Rear Window is a Hitchcock masterpiece. At times it gets a bit slow but that is justified as this adds to the suspense.

It's been considered by many as one of the most beloved motion pictures of all time. Even people who usually hate musicals can't bring themselves to say they disliked Singin' in the Rain. Films in which everyone loves are very difficult to come by, because we all have such diverse tastes. Singin' in the Rain is a timeless American classic because it has something in it for everybody. There's outstanding songs and dances, high-end production values, excellent Technicolor cinematography, lots of laughs, terrific writing, irresistible story and characters, everything you could possibly want from a film musical. But Singin' in the Rain is much more than just a great movie. It's one of the rare films that is unquestionably guaranteed to heal any mentally depressed soul. Gene Kelly plays Don Lockwood, a highly popular silent film star in the roaring 1920's who works for the film studio Monumental Pictures alongside his best friend\/musician Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor, in a wonderful performance) and leading lady Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen). Don is having a difficult time tolerating his frequent co-star, but the studio insists on carrying out a fake romance with Lina for the sake of maintaining their popularity with the public. One night when he tries to escape from some crazy fans, he accidentally meets a stage actress\/chorus girl named Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds). At first, she says some harsh words towards Don that makes him question how good he is at his profession. But soon enough, Don and Kathy start to fall in love with each other and Kathy becomes a reliable new star for the studio. There's only one problem with their romance Lina still thinks she and Don are a couple. And let's just say she isn't amused with the idea of Don and Kathy being together and she'll do anything in her power to make sure they're separated. So that's the love story in a nutshell. However, I didn't mention that the picture Don and Lina are currently working on next is becoming a troublesome production. Not only are the technical experts having trouble figuring out where to put the microphones, but Lina's voice isn't sitting well with the cast and crew. Singin' in the Rain is at its funniest when it's showing us the filmmaking process and the challenges the cast and crew have to face when trying to get the sound to work right. The director (Douglas Fowley) in particular was hilarious in terms of expressing just how frustrated he was with each and every take. You practically see every reaction you could possibly get from this guy in a situation like this with each reaction funnier than the last. I personally got a kick out of the members in the audience in each film screening we see. I love how in the test screening of one picture, some girls are jealous of Lina's glamour. And in another, some guys are doing sort of a Mystery Science Theatre 3000 routine picking it apart and laughing for all the wrong reasons (I love you. I love you. I love you.). The filmmaking process and the smart audience members aren't the only elements that make the script by Adolph Green and Betty Comden so excellent. For one thing, I love how Green and Comden handled the character of Cosmo. He often receives less credit than what he deserves, but he never lets this disadvantage get to him. Cosmo still helps out his best friend Don with his musical contributions and shows his loyalty to Don in that sense. He's never jealous of Don to the point where he goes off on his own to try and top him. Thank God! Cosmo's just perfectly content with what's he currently got and I think he's pretty awesome for that. Don and Lina's relationship is absolutely hilarious. You can clearly see Don struggling to stay calm over Lina and the wrong ideas she keeps obtaining from the fan magazines. I love how everyone including Don keeps talking down on Lina so that anything they say with a smile will be interpreted as nice to her even when it's not. I also bought the chemistry between Don and Kathy. Even though it's been brought to my attention that Debbie Reynolds had a difficult time with Gene Kelly during this picture's production, it never felt that way with her performance. That's of course a huge compliment to the acting talent of both Kelly and Reynolds to convince us that they're in love even though they didn't get along on set. Funny how the central romances for both Singin' in the Rain and Some Like it Hot (1959) were between people who couldn't stand each other, but I digress.Perhaps what Singin' in the Rain is best remembered for aside from its story, characters, and comedy are its musical numbers. Everyone remembers when Don Lockwood is literally singing in the rain in the famous title tune. It's one of the most recognized scenes in film history for a reason. Amazing that Gene Kelly did the number while he had a fever. Cosmo's classic Make 'Em Laugh number has plenty of wit, comedic energy and innovation to spare. Did I mention that Donald O'Connor did all the stunts in the number himself? It goes to show you how dedicated and passionate these artists were during that era. The entire soundtrack is just perfect with other fun highlights including Moses Supposes and Good Morning, in which Debbie Reynolds does a great job keeping up with Kelly and O'Connor. What else can I say? Singin' in the Rain &#x96; the greatest musical ever made and one of the rare films that deserves its enormous hype. If you're tired of what's shown in theatres today and are looking for something much more lighthearted and timeless, you owe it to yourself to see Singin' in the Rain.

The filmmaking process and the smart audience members aren't the only elements that make the script by Adolph Green and Betty Comden so excellent. For one thing, I love how Green and Comden handled the character of Cosmo. He often receives less credit than what he deserves, but he never lets this disadvantage get to him. Cosmo still helps out his best friend Don with his musical contributions and shows his loyalty to Don in that sense. He's never jealous of Don to the point where he goes off on his own to try and top him. Thank God! Cosmo's just perfectly content with what's he currently got and I think he's pretty awesome for that. Don and Lina's relationship is absolutely hilarious. You can clearly see Don struggling to stay calm over Lina and the wrong ideas she keeps obtaining from the fan magazines. I love how everyone including Don keeps talking down on Lina so that anything they say with a smile will be interpreted as nice to her even when it's not. I also bought the chemistry between Don and Kathy. Even though it's been brought to my attention that Debbie Reynolds had a difficult time with Gene Kelly during this picture's production, it never felt that way with her performance. That's of course a huge compliment to the acting talent of both Kelly and Reynolds to convince us that they're in love even though they didn't get along on set. Funny how the central romances for both Singin' in the Rain and Some Like it Hot (1959) were between people who couldn't stand each other, but I digress.Perhaps what Singin' in the Rain is best remembered for aside from its story, characters, and comedy are its musical numbers. Everyone remembers when Don Lockwood is literally singing in the rain in the famous title tune. It's one of the most recognized scenes in film history for a reason. Amazing that Gene Kelly did the number while he had a fever. Cosmo's classic Make 'Em Laugh number has plenty of wit, comedic energy and innovation to spare. Did I mention that Donald O'Connor did all the stunts in the number himself? It goes to show you how dedicated and passionate these artists were during that era. The entire soundtrack is just perfect with other fun highlights including Moses Supposes and Good Morning, in which Debbie Reynolds does a great job keeping up with Kelly and O'Connor. What else can I say? Singin' in the Rain &#x96; the greatest musical ever made and one of the rare films that deserves its enormous hype. If you're tired of what's shown in theatres today and are looking for something much more lighthearted and timeless, you owe it to yourself to see Singin' in the Rain.

It's been considered by many as one of the most beloved motion pictures of all time. Even people who usually hate musicals can't bring themselves to say they disliked Singin' in the Rain. Films in which everyone loves are very difficult to come by, because we all have such diverse tastes. Singin' in the Rain is a timeless American classic because it has something in it for everybody. There's outstanding songs and dances, high-end production values, excellent Technicolor cinematography, lots of laughs, terrific writing, irresistible story and characters, everything you could possibly want from a film musical. But Singin' in the Rain is much more than just a great movie. It's one of the rare films that is unquestionably guaranteed to heal any mentally depressed soul. Gene Kelly plays Don Lockwood, a highly popular silent film star in the roaring 1920's who works for the film studio Monumental Pictures alongside his best friend\/musician Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor, in a wonderful performance) and leading lady Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen). Don is having a difficult time tolerating his frequent co-star, but the studio insists on carrying out a fake romance with Lina for the sake of maintaining their popularity with the public. One night when he tries to escape from some crazy fans, he accidentally meets a stage actress\/chorus girl named Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds). At first, she says some harsh words towards Don that makes him question how good he is at his profession. But soon enough, Don and Kathy start to fall in love with each other and Kathy becomes a reliable new star for the studio. There's only one problem with their romance Lina still thinks she and Don are a couple. And let's just say she isn't amused with the idea of Don and Kathy being together and she'll do anything in her power to make sure they're separated. So that's the love story in a nutshell. However, I didn't mention that the picture Don and Lina are currently working on next is becoming a troublesome production. Not only are the technical experts having trouble figuring out where to put the microphones, but Lina's voice isn't sitting well with the cast and crew. Singin' in the Rain is at its funniest when it's showing us the filmmaking process and the challenges the cast and crew have to face when trying to get the sound to work right. The director (Douglas Fowley) in particular was hilarious in terms of expressing just how frustrated he was with each and every take. You practically see every reaction you could possibly get from this guy in a situation like this with each reaction funnier than the last. I personally got a kick out of the members in the audience in each film screening we see. I love how in the test screening of one picture, some girls are jealous of Lina's glamour.

There's no way around, saying it's a bad movie. Today, with people who still carry drugs across the country (idiots) it's a crying shame these people won't learn. Watch this movie to see what happens if you get caught with stuff in an unfamiliar and hostile country, cause this is what exactly happens here, where the late great Davis who plays, drug trafficker, Billy Hayes gets caught with hashish strapped around his body. From the opening scene, a screen shot of Turkey we know the scene is set for a great movie. Too in detail, we see Davis strapping the thick foiled bundles to his chest, while also priming himself not just at the airport in the bathroom, but in the mirror here. When caught, so begins a trapped hell in a sh..hole of a prison, where one brutish thug warden Hamoui (a fantastic Paul Smith) rules the roost. Randy Quaid, delivers a good performance like he usually does, as the angry, hyped and unthinking inmate while Hurt is unforgettable as the crazed and funny prisoner, Max, who eventually loses his marbles, reduced to a mumbling mummy. Let me tell you, there are a couple of heavy scenes to watch, involving beatings, and Stone has told a true story well with his great and detailed screenplay which is a much enjoyable read, all though I didn't read all of it, where small chunks were cut of the script, throughout, much so after the ending, that has him pulling a sham as a guard going home, before running and leaping up into a pause shot. The talented Stone knows how to write scripts, and even if it didn't win best script, in my opinion it's still a winner. Did I mention too Rifkie, a prisoner who bunks with Max and Billy, who a plays dirty, crawling prisoner, one scene forcing Billy to lose it, where he ends in the nutter section of the prison. The film is well shot. I really did love the shots with Billy making an escape from authorities where he's cornered by Hopkins. And when seeing Billy in the dock, receiving the ugly news about his fate, where his case is reviewed, again it just shows you what a stupid thing smuggling crap in is. I love a true story like this, when it's translated well to film, and Stone has a great grip on the handling on this story. It's a heavy and grim film, but emotionally powerful, if by the brilliant and sincere performances, like Hurt, David, and the guy playing his father.

I'm on a roll. I was so irritated by the first movie I went to see today (day off - Tammy) that I had to write a review. Then I followed it by a review of another current movie out which I loved (Maleficent), which brings me to my all time favorite movie, All That Jazz, and I promise you, after I get done with with this one, I will pack it in for the night until something else sends me over the edge. This is a film that never ever fails to disappoint. I think I've seen it maybe - at last count - and still counting - 20 twenty times. This movie holds up so well, so beautifully, it gets me every time and every time I am just as moved and taken as I was when I first saw it. Roy Scheider is brilliant, but he's nothing compared to Ann Reinking or Leland Palmer. I could sit and watch this movie without sound, the costumes that Wolsky did are so superb and spectacular, if you've never seen this movie again, don't read another word and watch it. It's the most classic of all classic Bob Fosse, with a sense of what is waiting for him that makes one want to believe in something more. The dance number - and no, this is not a spoiler and won't ruin it - is the number between Ann and the kid. Tell me you can see that just once. When I've had a bad day and don't know what's next, I YouTube that and everything is right in the world again. Again, I'm not going to offer any spoilers, but the movie only gets better with time and a frequent number of viewings. Jessica Lange never looked better. In fact, I'm not sure if any of them ever looked better and this movie - not any of the others - is what made me fall head over heels in LOVE with Bob Fosse.

I hated the people that put that s**t out into the world,so I just made up for it by writing two review on movies that offer redemption for all the crap that's out there.

But perhaps the stand-out characters of this movie are not the criminal yet moral Mr. White, or the young cop Mr. Orange, no, the true stars of this movie are Mr. Blonde and Mr. Pink. Mr. Blonde, aka Vic Vega, is a calm, sadistic psychopathic killer disguised as a professional criminal - and the scene in which he tortures Marvin Nash will continually echo throughout the halls of film history as one that blends black comedy, gore, and excellent acting into one of the most memorable moments of cinema. In this, Madsen effortlessly depicts a man who takes nothing but pleasure from the pure torture of an innocent man, who in turn is revealed to be an unsung hero, for keeping the identity of Mr. Orange a secret. But Madsen's dancing to Stealer's Wheels stuck in the middle with you, is so subtly funny, that we almost do not feel sympathy for the poor cop who is robbed of his ear, yet, whilst we follow the scene from his perspective, our attentions are purely concerned with Madsen's subtle insanity. Indeed, you do ask yourself; ''why would Joe hire a guy like that?'' Mr. Pink however is the standout character of this movie; Steve Bescumi steals the show, and Tarantino leaves much to the imagination with this ambiguous and rat-like character. In a movie that is so direct in its dialogue and gore, we might almost forget about the art-work Tarantino puts into his presentation of Mr. Pink, which, in my opinion, is absolutely flawless. The opening ''tip-scene'' sets up Mr. Pink as the outside of the group, the one who applies methodical thought to his actions and reasoning, the one who will stick to his principles regardless of what the other characters are doing, and this scene alone, separates the wolf from the ''dogs''. You would never think it though would you, as Keitel's Mr. White humorously kicks the man on the floor, he looks rather helpless, squirming around, trying to find his gun to turn the odds in his favour - as the iconic image of the two men pointing their guns at each other shows us, even when he's down, Mr. Pink is ever resourceful. He is the only lead character whose identity is a mystery to us; he is an entity, we know almost nothing about this character, yet, he is the only one to escape, he is the winner of this film, leaving his partners in crime dead and bloody as he crawls away with the diamonds. The nothingness that consumes our knowledge of this character's profile is what makes him the movies defining star; he is the only man who does not reveal his identity, he follows the rules, stays, as he would say ''professional'', and for following his principles, he has emerged victorious - remember what I was saying about the tipping scene? He is the lone man who remains calm, who remains moderately objective and reasonable to the situation, as I say, emerging victorious. Overall, Tarantino's debut is one of subtly, and yet one of brutality, that makes the most of its characters, its dialogue, its soundtrack, and , if nothing else, its awe inspiring camera work - which is textbook for any director to follow if they want to know how to use a camera.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"3 July 2014","score":"","review":" with this simple, bloody, and artistic masterpiece Quentin Tarantino tells the movie world with his directional debut that he is here, and he is here to stay, as perhaps one of the greatest artistically diverse directors of recent memory. the characters of this film are some of the most memorable and quotable of film history, with so many scenes that just ooze coolness, amazing scripting, and subtle creativity that leaves the viewer wanting to see more and more of Tarantino. But perhaps the stand-out characters of this movie are not the criminal yet moral Mr. White, or the young cop Mr. Orange, no, the true stars of this movie are Mr. Blonde and Mr. Pink. Mr. Blonde, aka Vic Vega, is a calm, sadistic psychopathic killer disguised as a professional criminal - and the scene in which he tortures Marvin Nash will continually echo throughout the halls of film history as one that blends black comedy, gore, and excellent acting into one of the most memorable moments of cinema. In this, Madsen effortlessly depicts a man who takes nothing but pleasure from the pure torture of an innocent man, who in turn is revealed to be an unsung hero, for keeping the identity of Mr. Orange a secret. But Madsen's dancing to Stealer's Wheels stuck in the middle with you, is so subtly funny, that we almost do not feel sympathy for the poor cop who is robbed of his ear, yet, whilst we follow the scene from his perspective, our attentions are purely concerned with Madsen's subtle insanity. Indeed, you do ask yourself; ''why would Joe hire a guy like that?'' Mr. Pink however is the standout character of this movie; Steve Bescumi steals the show, and Tarantino leaves much to the imagination with this ambiguous and rat-like character. In a movie that is so direct in its dialogue and gore, we might almost forget about the art-work Tarantino puts into his presentation of Mr. Pink, which, in my opinion, is absolutely flawless. The opening ''tip-scene'' sets up Mr. Pink as the outside of the group, the one who applies methodical thought to his actions and reasoning, the one who will stick to his principles regardless of what the other characters are doing, and this scene alone, separates the wolf from the ''dogs''. You would never think it though would you, as Keitel's Mr. White humorously kicks the man on the floor, he looks rather helpless, squirming around, trying to find his gun to turn the odds in his favour - as the iconic image of the two men pointing their guns at each other shows us, even when he's down, Mr. Pink is ever resourceful. He is the only lead character whose identity is a mystery to us; he is an entity, we know almost nothing about this character, yet, he is the only one to escape, he is the winner of this film, leaving his partners in crime dead and bloody as he crawls away with the diamonds. The nothingness that consumes our knowledge of this character's profile is what makes him the movies defining star; he is the only man who does not reveal his identity, he follows the rules, stays, as he would say ''professional'', and for following his principles, he has emerged victorious - remember what I was saying about the tipping scene?

The original stage production of Sleuth by Anthony Shaffer opened on Broadway on 12 November 1970. It originally starred Anthony Quayle as Andrew and Keith Baxter as Milo, ran for 1222 performances and won the 1971 Tony Award for the Best Play . This is a deliciously sardonic and witty movie and excellently starred by a magnificent protagonist duo ; both are the peak of their game in this dazzling film . This interesting movie is plenty of twists and turns and stunning surprises . Splendid and fascinating performances , a real Tour De force for two stars . Michael Caine was so very much beside himself to be working with Laurence Olivier, that he didn't even know how to address him . However , Michael Caine was the third choice for the part of Milo Tindle after Albert Finney , who was deemed too plump, and Alan Bates , who turned down the role .

Bernard Rose, who had made the original film, had written the first draft of the script, and it is interesting because Candyman never actually appears in it. (Apparently about this time he was also working on a script for Midnight Meat Train, but the eventual film was written by Jeff Buhler, so it does not seem any of Rose's ideas made it very far.) Director Bill Condon actually came in late, only a few months before shooting began. By then, it had gone through multiple drafts and at least three writers (after Rose, Rand Ravich and Mark Kruger were on board). Condon shared an agent with Clive Barker, which helped get him in the director's chair. As he puts it, he was in movie jail and had been stuck making made-for-TV movies for a few years. (As of 2016, he has become wildly successful with Dreamgirls and some Twilight films, just to name a few.) As for the setting, after Cabrini Green, where do you go? Well, there is another impoverished place where the desperate might believe in Candyman New Orleans. And, this film offers him an origin story that was barely fleshed out in the first film. Perhaps we can feel some sympathy for this monster? Although not as strong as the original, this is a solid sequel that keeps the same feel and relies heavily on the same Phil Glass theme music (much of the original soundtrack is carried over). The sequel is more traditional in its approach to horror, being more of a slasher than a mood, and where Candyman was something of a myth in the first film, we now know he truly exists as a flesh and blood being. The mirror theme is brought back, both literally and in new, subtle ways. The lead character has trouble painting her self-portrait&#x85; this is, in a way, the failure to see herself in a mirror.There are a few too many jump or bus scares, but also plenty of decent gore shots for those who need the blood. Roger Ebert noted this, writing, It's got one of those soundtracks where everyday sounds are amplified into gut-churning shockaramas, and where we are constantly being startled by false alarms. Even Condon concedes the point; he calls them boo scares, and is sort of embarrassed about them in retrospect, not realizing how they might play outside of a theater audience.The film has something to say on race and slavery, though it is not heavy-handed about it. So far as I know, Candyman is the first black horror villain to have a sequel since Blacula. With the third installment, he may be the only black horror icon ever to have three films. Although not black myself, it is interesting how the black community has latched on to Tony Todd as their horror icon &#x96; conventions that are typically 90% white male have a bit more color when Todd is a guest.As always, Scream Factory provides some great features on their blu-ray for a film that mainstream movie watchers would not think was worth the trouble. The Bill Condon audio commentary is very insightful, though Condon does tend to stutter and stammer a bit. Along with that are new interviews, including with the Candyman himself, Tony Todd.

The incidental music is mostly grand and cinematic with a couple of quirky spots that sound like the music used in the series; however while most pop songs were pleasant, funny and catchy, they weren't as memorable as the Baha Men's number, Geri Halliwell's version of 'These Boots Are Made For Walking,' and the rendition of 'Bad Girl' performed by Angelica and the sushi place staff.

The trio become fast friends. Doctor Dolittle is a genius who can talk to all kinds of animals, in nearly 500 languages. A veterinarian, Doolittle is a reluctant vegetarian. This is understandable, because many animals live with him. To raise money and good will, Dolittle and his two friends take a newly acquired Pushmi-pullyu (picture a two-headed llama) from Tibet to display in the circus, which turns out to be quite an adventure...The main problem with this adventure is running time. This film is way too long. Perhaps, if it were better, one wouldn't be so bored. Original writer Hugh Lofting's books were delightful and ended too soon, but movie seems to go on forever. Although it initially sounds like a great casting choice, Mr. Harrison is unable to summon the needed charm. The veteran actor should have walked through the role with few problems, but is done in by poor pace, staging and (again) running time. Harrison also butchers the strongest song in the musical; hopefully, he re-recorded Leslie Bricusse's (If I Could) Talk to the Animals at some point. It became a hit in other versions.
