Double Indemnity contains all these elements and defines this genre better than any movie I've ever seen. I have to give this movie a 10 and not because I like giving perfect scores but because of the towering performances of three of the all time great actors of American film as well the masterful directing and writing of Billy Wilder. I've been a big Billy Wilder fan for some years now and I believe this is his masterpiece.Wilder directed and co-wrote (with Raymond Chandler) Double Indemnity, and worked hard to convince the two stars, Barbara Stanwyck and Fred McMurray to overcome their hesitancy and join him in this endeavor. Both didn't like the idea of playing these shady characters, but because they did we end up with possibly the best acting trio (along with Edward G. Robinson) ever in one film. Bold statement yes, but I'm talking about PERFECT casting here...straight down the line.Stanwyck plays Phyllis Dietrichson, she's married to an older man who she detests and one day a wise-cracking insurance salesman named Walter Neff (McMurray) comes to the door and they begin talking...or should I say flirting. This marvelous introductory scene is the essence of film-noir, filled with fast lines with double meanings and it really captivates us right from the start. Phyllis asks about accident insurance for her husband and the banter continues and then Neff leaves. He leaves, but hes hooked (as are we), and later Phyllis stops by his apartment and they get closer and start plotting. Wouldn't it be nice if they could knock off her hubby and split the insurance payout?What a premise; this is the ultimate film-noir plot setup. They start meeting secretly and planning, meanwhile Neff tries to keep his prying (and extremely perceptive) boss Keyes (Robinson) at arms length. Edward G. Robinson, playing against type as an all-consumed, almost anal claims investigator, gives a performance that is truly the foundation of this film. Stanwyck, to me is maybe the most talented all-around actress in Hollywood history and the extremely under-rated McMurray (also cast against type) displays an easy charm that covers up his building anxiety, and they are both fantastic, but Robinson absolutely shines as the insurance scam expert who claims the little man in my stomach won't let him rest easy. There's a brilliant scene where Keyes shoots down his bosses' idea of the crime being a suicide by quoting statistics from actuary tables and you'd think at the time he was in on the plot with Neff (of course we know he isn't) because he is so convincing and compelling. I really think its one of the greatest supporting performances ever in film.We get some of the little plot twists that we'd expect in a film-noir, as Walter and Phyllis decide whether they should even contact each other until the heat dies down. Walter at times seems to be coming completely unglued while Phyllis' cold, conniving exterior is hiding secrets she hasn't told anyone. The great fun in watching Double Indemnity is just watching these incredible stars do their thing. There aren't any shoot-outs or big explosions or effects like you see in todays films, instead there is the charisma of three extremely talented actors who absolutely radiate their skills in the hands of one the best directors in history.So sit back and enjoy a masterpiece of film. This is what movies used to be about when acting, writing and directing were often honed to perfection.BTW..If you like this film and want some other Wilder films try; The Lost Weekend (Ray Milland) or Stalag 17 or Sunset Blvd (William Holden) or The Apartment (Jack Lemmon)...These are all critically acclaimed and all of these except Stalag 17 are on the AFI Top 100 list....but (to me) Double Indemnity is the best of them all, enjoy.

Everything about this film makes me smile, except the sad bits of course. Every year since I first clapped eyes on this film I have made it habitual viewing on the run up to Christmas. Michael Caine is perfect in his role as Ebeneezer Scrooge. It's hard not to rate his performance in this film as he delivers a fantastic turn opposite what is essentially someone's hand covered in felt and foam. My one grumble, however, has been the removal of one of the songs from the DVDs and TV broadcasts more recently - When Scrooge is in the past and splits up with his partner. The song was very poignant and Caine's voice breaking as he fought back tears in the duet had me biting my fist and trying not to blub like a 5-year-old.

As an intelligent, mature, film enthusiast, this film is a masterpiece of it's unfortunately and often under appreciated and confused genre. No, it's not really a horror film, in the truest sense of the word. There is a difference between horror and terror. Something most filmmakers to this day don't seem to understand or appreciate. Terror is the apprehension of something bad or frightening about to happen, horror is the actual realization of that imagined horror. Alfred Hitchcock understood this and used it very effectively throughout his long film career.This exceptionally effective chiller relies on mystery, suspense and audience imagination. Bravo! Cheers! Kudos! How I wish this film making style could return. I'm not easily frightened nor easy to impress. This film had me tense and absorbed all the way through. There's definitely a feeling of tension lingering, after the end of the film. Since I know I'm hard to impress or frighten, I viewed this film for the first time, in a very suitable setting home alone and late at night, for maximum effect.It's quite an intelligent and psychologically interesting movie for its genre, one of the best I've ever seen. Haunted houses are a big part of folklore, all over the world for centuries, but not such a common genre for movies.Four supernatural investigators spend several nights in a feared famous old haunted house with a bad history.The unusual and long prologue effectively sets up the bad history of the house.

The dominant character of this film is Hill House itself, secondly, Eleanor (one of the ghost hunters) and thirdly, the leader of the supernatural group. The impressive and convincing effects of the film are entirely physical and optical. This film had me impressed from beginning to end. Compared to most other chillers or haunted house movies, The Haunting is definitely superior. Wise directs in the classic style of Hitchcock. Upon one viewing, I consider this film to be one of the best ever of it's genre.The puzzle of this story is were the prior residents of Hill House mentally ill, as well as Eleanor? The character of Eleanor is most interesting, as she is certainly a sympathetic, lonely and lost soul. She is often the narrator of the story, we often hear her thoughts. In a film with good, solid acting performances all around, the performance of Eleanor's character is most impressive. She certainly did her homework for the role and was very well cast.The brilliance and power of The Haunting, is that it explores the very nature of fear and relies on the audience to actively use their own imagination, experiencing the film. We humans fear the darkness. We fear the unknown. Fear what we don't understand. What's supernatural now may be explained in future generations and become the accepted normal, most people later will take for granted. This imaginative, intelligent and suspenseful style of film making has sadly almost completely disappeared. Most horror\/chiller\/thriller films now rely heavily on graphically depicted violence, with little or nothing left to the imagination. Shock and repulsiveness have largely replaced true horror, mystery and suspense. The great power of all storytelling is having the audience use its own imagination.

It is certainly a war film, with lots of battle scenes, but nevertheless quite distinct from the stereotype battlefield spectacle. This is partly due to the director Loach, who has neither the urge nor the financial means to produce a large-scale report on battle-fields. However the main reason is the civil war itself, since the republic (the good guys) was defended by a peoples army, and not a professional one. In fact we witness the experiences of a militia, consisting of normal grown-up citizens, not the juvenile cannon fodder, that is crowding the average WW2 or Vietnam movie. When in Land and Freedom the militia attacks the trenches of the fascist troops, it is not a furious storm but a wearisome advancement, evidently by people whose physical conditions could have been better. The firing with their rifles seems unaimed and chaotic. At first I thought this was a display of bad acting, but in fact it is just the opposite. For the militia was composed of volunteers with little or no military training or background. Loach says in an interview, that the film is a critique on the stance of the republicans during the war. The resistance started as a collaboration between anarchist, Bolshevist and social-democrat groups, but soon the ideological differences started to cause growing frictions. Not surprisingly the Bolshevists were once again hoping to replicate the October revolution and seize power during the conflict. On the other hand the anarchists and syndicalists rejected any form of organization, and fully relied on the innate peoples will. Loach made this debate into the essential thread of the film. The story is like this it is 1936. The British Communist Party recruits volunteers for international reserves of the republican army. David, who is a member of the BCP and out of work, travels to Spain and joins a militia of the POUM (apparently a Trotzkyist-anarchist fraction in the Spanish government). The militia consists of Spaniards (including two women), Frenchmen, Britons, an American, a German etc. They stay together for more than a year, and are remarkably spared the grief of casualties. At that time, and even during WWII, warfare did not yet have the professional intensity of the battlefields in Irak or Afghanistan. They are just killing time in their trenches. Even when a village is stormed, that is occupied by fascist troops, the enemy is already on the run. The number of fallen comrades in this action equals just one, and there is plenty of time for grief and a decent burial. Subsequently the militia joins the villagers in a debate about socialization of the agricultural land! Really, that are the syndicalists for you, they seem almost like Taliban. In the mean time, the government in Madrid realizes that this kind of defense will not win the war.

It is certainly a war film, with lots of battle scenes, but nevertheless quite distinct from the stereotype battlefield spectacle. This is partly due to the director Loach, who has neither the urge nor the financial means to produce a large-scale report on battle-fields. However the main reason is the civil war itself, since the republic (the good guys) was defended by a peoples army, and not a professional one. In fact we witness the experiences of a militia, consisting of normal grown-up citizens, not the juvenile cannon fodder, that is crowding the average WW2 or Vietnam movie. When in Land and Freedom the militia attacks the trenches of the fascist troops, it is not a furious storm but a wearisome advancement, evidently by people whose physical conditions could have been better. The firing with their rifles seems unaimed and chaotic. At first I thought this was a display of bad acting, but in fact it is just the opposite. For the militia was composed of volunteers with little or no military training or background. Loach says in an interview, that the film is a critique on the stance of the republicans during the war. The resistance started as a collaboration between anarchist, Bolshevist and social-democrat groups, but soon the ideological differences started to cause growing frictions. Not surprisingly the Bolshevists were once again hoping to replicate the October revolution and seize power during the conflict. On the other hand the anarchists and syndicalists rejected any form of organization, and fully relied on the innate peoples will. Loach made this debate into the essential thread of the film. The story is like this it is 1936. The British Communist Party recruits volunteers for international reserves of the republican army. David, who is a member of the BCP and out of work, travels to Spain and joins a militia of the POUM (apparently a Trotzkyist-anarchist fraction in the Spanish government). The militia consists of Spaniards (including two women), Frenchmen, Britons, an American, a German etc. They stay together for more than a year, and are remarkably spared the grief of casualties. At that time, and even during WWII, warfare did not yet have the professional intensity of the battlefields in Irak or Afghanistan. They are just killing time in their trenches. Even when a village is stormed, that is occupied by fascist troops, the enemy is already on the run. The number of fallen comrades in this action equals just one, and there is plenty of time for grief and a decent burial. Subsequently the militia joins the villagers in a debate about socialization of the agricultural land! Really, that are the syndicalists for you, they seem almost like Taliban. In the mean time, the government in Madrid realizes that this kind of defense will not win the war.

It's not as common now, when so many movies seem to start out as marketing campaigns long before they become stories. It didn't use to be unusual, though, for filmmakers to create one sort of movie and the studio to try and sell it too the public as something else. When The Big Easy first came out in theaters, I recall the ads for it making it seem like it was some sort of erotic thriller. It's actually a pretty good romantic comedy with a little extra dash of violence.Unsurprisingly set in New Orleans, the star of this story is Remy McSwain (Dennis Quaid), a police lieutenant in the homicide division. Remy's a genuine Cajun boy, complete with accent and a laissez faire attitude toward things like ethics and department regulations. He's called in to investigate the murder of a local wise guy and is joined on the case by a new assistant district attorney, Ann Osborn (Ellen Barkin), who's assigned to police corruption cases but is very interested in this mob slaying. Remy's not that interested in her assistance, but he really, really wants to get into her pants. After relentlessly hitting on her in a way that would get him charged with sexual harassment nowadays, they end up in bed before Remy is called away to a double murder. These two new African-American victims appear to be the ones that killed the first mobster, and Remy theorizes that there's a drug war going on in New Orleans between the Italian mafia and the voodoo-tinged, black organized criminals in town.Remy and Ann's investigation is cut short when he's caught up in the famous corruption of the New Orleans police force. The Big Easy depicts local law enforcement as awash in graft and payoffs. Remy is caught on tape discussing bribe money with a tavern owner and Ann is assigned to prosecute his case. It seems like Remy is sure to be convicted, but he manages to get the charges dismissed with a little help from his friends. Ann is infuriated and wants nothing more to do with him and more bodies pile up as the supposed drug war rages on. To get the girl back, Remy has to actually become the good guy he's always imagined himself to be and then the two of them have to uncover who's really behind these killings and why.Some people might quibble with me calling The Big Easy a romantic comedy, but there's way too many jokes and funny performances in this film to consider it a drama. And while the twin plot threads of the alleged drug war and police corruption are well developed, the most important thing in the movie is the relationship between Remy and Ann. In fact, what makes this such a good movie is that it utilizes so many non-traditional story elements for a romantic comedy. It doesn't have to go through a bunch of ridiculous contortions to keep its two lovebirds apart, generating a fresh and lively energy in the story.The greatest strength of the film is in the performances of its two lead actors. Quaid creates a horny and lovable scoundrel in Remy, a cop who thinks as long as he doesn't break the big laws, he can ignore all the little ones. Barkin is extremely sexy as Ann, letting us see a woman full of repressed desire just yearning to break free. They have great chemistry together, whether they're fussing or smootching. There are also some funny supporting performances from John Goodman, Tom O'Brien and Lisa Jane Persky as Remy's fellow cops.The Big Easy would be a smart choice for a date movie.

The wimpy kid (if someone teased me about my dead mom, I think I'd try a heck of a lot harder to kick his butt). Twin girls (a tip of the hat to The Shining?) And I guess it's getting more difficult for me to suspend my disbelief. Example Zowie's blood is not coagulating even though his heart isn't beating. If he was dead internally, he'd be getting crispier, not more gooey. Zowie comes back all screwed up, but HEY, LET'S BURY A GUY WHO IS ALREADY A BIG JERK thinking that he's going to come back okay? Yeah, that'll work. Far more silly than scary. The original was far better.

They're actually scare movies or shock movies or even sick titillation movies. The Wicker Man, though, is true to its genre. This film will unsettle, it will disturb and it will horrify you.Sergeant Howie (Edward Woodward) is a policeman summoned to a tiny island off the coast of Scotland to investigate the disappearance of a child. From the very moment he lands his seaplane and sets foot on Summerisle, Howie finds nothing but confusion and oddity. He can't get a straight answer from anyone about what happened to the girl or if she even existed. The girl's own mother won't tell him the truth. Howie does observe strange rituals, midnight orgies and blasphemous behavior. He finally meets Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee), who won't give him any answers about the missing girl but does tell Howie of the history of the island and the pagan religion that took hold of it. It is in that heathen worship that Howie comes to suspect that the missing girl's fate was death&#x85;or something worse.There is a lot to praise about The Wicker Man, but you have to start by lauding the two elements that have become the unique calling cards of this movie. Firstly, this is probably the only truly Christian horror movie. And I don't mean there are a bunch of demons and angels in the story or anything like that. At the heart of this film is a conflict between Christian faith and Christian living and the ancient superstitions and practices of paganism. Beyond a threat to life and limb, this movie challenges Christian belief and propriety. There is a lot of nudity and bawdiness in the story, but its presence is not to arouse but to tempt Christian virtue. The Wicker Man is a movie about depravity, degeneracy, brutality and death that remains suitable material for a church group because of the undeniably Christian dynamic at its heart.The other defining aspect of this film is that it is probably the only true horror-musical. There is a lot of people singing in this movie and none of it is meant to be ironic of comedic or to wink at the audience in some fashion. All of the songs and music play a role in creating and establishing the crazy and evil society Sergeant Howie falls into. Not only does it make everything on the island seem unreal and otherworldly, but the contrast between the jolly, happy songs of the pagans and the ominous and terrible acts that occur amplifies the discomfort and unease in the viewer.Edward Woodward and Christopher Lee are outstanding as the parochially Christian Sergeant Howie and the paradoxically more worldly pagan Lord Summerisle. The clash between these two men is one of the great standoffs in horror cinema and neither swings and ax or waives a machete at the other. Woodward plays a man of rigid faith but never lets that rigidity imprison Howie or turn him into an unsympathetic martinet. Lee's performance is even more subtle, playing a character who's meant to be more in tune with the feelings and attitudes of modern audiences yet never letting viewers ignore or deny the evil that dwells in Summerisle's heart.There's very little graphic violence in The Wicker Man and it's from an era when horror movies would often start out like a different kind of film, in this case a missing person mystery, before twisting into something awful before the audience's very eyes. So, if you've been weaned on the gorefests and overwrought suspense of horror films in the last several decades, you might need to have a little patience. If you stick with it, though, this movie will creep you out like few things you have ever seen. The Wicker Man is not a thrill ride. It is not supposed to be funny or exciting. It is a horror movie. Watch it at your own risk.And for pete's sake, make sure when you rent it that you're getting the original and not the thrice-damned remake starring Nicholas Cage. That one isn't a horror movie. It's just horrifyingly awful. ","genre":null},{"date":"22 October 2010","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Most horror movies never live up to that name.

That's Entertainment By Myself two other excellent moments. The final mise-en-scene with Fred Astair and Cyd Charise shows a darkness to Astaire that is often overlooked in his easy comedy.But Rogers and Hammerstein, and before them Hammerstein and Kern--SHOW BOAT--had created and perfected on Broadway the 'integrated musical' where music moved the story line forward.
