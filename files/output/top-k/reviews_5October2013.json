Meanwhile Anakin's master. Obi-Wan Kenobi, is sent to the hidden world of Kamino to investigate the origins of a mysterious clone army. It seems dark forces are amassing to threaten the safety of the Galactic Republic ...The second film in the modern trilogy of Star Wars movies is beautiful, exciting, visually dazzling and filled with extraordinary scenes. If it has a weakness, it's that it doesn't really have a beginning or end (like The Empire Strikes Back); instead it picks up directly where The Phantom Menace concludes, gradually building up the story of the opposing forces vying for control, and finishing with an extended grand battle. In some ways though this is also its strength - the characters come fully developed and the movie can take its time to weave its two main tales of love story and detective thriller around each other. Both of these work well, although it's the latter that really captures the imagination as Obi-Wan plunges first into an icy waterworld filled with sleek, polished architecture, and then onto the craggy brown mining planet of Geonosis, littered with igneous rocks, shale and brimstone, and populated by vicious insectoids. The story documents Anakin's combined rise to power and fall from grace as his desire to prove himself and dominate those around him corrupts his judgement and morality. Christensen acquits himself well in this tricky role; he must be heroic enough to make his tragedy bite, but also selfish and petty in his immaturity. As with the previous movie the ensemble are excellent, but the villainous parts are the choice ones, with Lee as the tricksy Count Dooku stealing the film. His triple duel with Anakin, Obi-Wan and then Yoda at the end is a showstopping finale. Equally, the movie is a tour-de-force of presentation and visual dynamics. John Williams' soaring love theme is the triumphant overture in a blaze of musical and sonic excess, combining with Ben Burtt's outstanding sound design in a unique and thrilling feast for the ears. During a space chase through an asteroid field with villain Jango Fett, Fett unleashes sonic bombs at Obi-Wan, and Burtt incredibly pulls all the sound out of the mix for one second then batters us with an explosion - incredible ! Just as impressive are the visual effects by Rob Coleman, Pablo Helman, John Knoll and Ben Snow; the last half-hour of the movie is a stunning array of amazing scenes; the gladiator-style fight-for-life in the arena, the epic Jedi\/droid fight, the dropship battle in the desert and Count Dooku's retreat. But for every action-packed moment there are as many quiet, pensive, tensely understated scenes; Obi-Wan's guarded meeting with Jango, the moment with the now-down-at-heel Watto, Owen and Beru's introduction. As with all his work, it's Lucas' gift to blend action, drama, romance and escapism into a rounded, satisfying whole. In some ways this movie is all set up for the big finale of its sequel (Revenge Of The Sith), but despite this it's one of the richest and most enjoyable fantasy movies ever made.

An astounding masterpiece for all ages that's perfectly balanced in the smallest of aspects & still hasn't aged a day, this is without a doubt the greatest Disney film of all time.Set in the Pride Lands of Africa, The Lion King tells the story of a young lion prince who flees into exile after the death of his father when his uncle tricks him into believing that he is the one responsible for the king's demise. Growing up with two outcasts & embracing their carefree attitude, he is ultimately forced to confront his past after a chance encounter with an old friend & decides to return to his homeland.Directed by Roger Allers & Rob Minkoff, the film opens on such a grand note that its prologue alone is much better than most features turn out to be in their entire runtime. The whole story has an epic feel to it despite its grounded simplicity, the plot unfolds like a soothing breeze, the themes are handled with care, entertainment is top-notch and its carefully carved out characters add even more richness to the story.Each frame of its beautifully rendered animation is a work of spellbinding craftsmanship. Characters are brilliantly sketched too & do manage to express emotions amazingly well. Cinematography makes expert use of colour palettes & vibrant use of camera. Editing provides a frenetic pace to the whole narrative & is at its best during the musical numbers, while CGI is seamlessly integrated into its hand-drawn imagery.Although nearly every character in the picture has a well-defined arc, what makes them so much fun is the pitch-perfect voice cast that infuses new life into these characters & provide them their very own souls. James Earl Jones brings a king-like imposing quality to Mufasa, Matthew Broderick does well as Simba, Jeremy Irons is thrilling as Scar while both Nathan Lane & Ernie Sabella steal the show as Timon & Pumbaa with their impeccable timing & perfect chemistry.And last but not the least, I'd like to talk about its magnificent score. Composed by Hans Zimmer who was just starting out back then, the exquisitely arranged & masterfully orchestrated score elevates what was already an incredibly fascinating tale to such a grandeur level of epicness that even today, it remains the finest use of music in any animation feature out there. And further strengthening this aspect are catchy songs written by Tim Rice & Elton John.On an overall scale, The Lion King is an extraordinary blend of a highly gripping story, deftly written screenplay, state-of-the-art animation, cleverly drawn characters voiced by wisely chosen cast, terrific use of humour, skillful camera-work, tight editing as well as an outstanding score plus sensational songs, all of which work in seamless harmony in order to set an entirely new benchmark for its medium & effortlessly succeed.An emotionally stirring adventure that's full of heart, passion & creativity from start to finish, The Lion King is an unabashedly hilarious, occasionally melancholic, extremely intimate, thoroughly enjoyable, delightfully engaging, intensely thrilling, wildly entertaining & immensely satisfying fable about life, death, identity, responsibility & resurrection that borrows from William Shakespeare's Hamlet yet is able to carve out its very own identity before it is finished.Marking the last great high for Disney's Renaissance Era that came crashing down soon after the advent of Pixar Animation Studios, The Lion King is a work of cinematic perfection that still stands tall & remains unblemished by the test of time and, for the epic this timeless classic is in every sense of the word, will continue to do so comfortably for a very foreseeable future. Absolutely worth your time & money, the crown jewel of Walt Disney Animation comes one hundred percent recommended.

On an overall scale, Shadow of a Doubt remains one of the finest achievements in cinema that's as effective today as it was 70 years ago & isn't Hitchcock's personal favourite from his glorious filmography for nothing.A defining classic in every sense of the word, an influential example of its genre & a must for every cinema lover out there, Shadow of a Doubt comes highly recommended.

I remember being a child and teen and finding most of what was thrown out to an audience to be acceptable and even enjoyable. But there comes a time when one grows critical and unless one is willing to accept event after staged event of extreme unlikeliness occurring, a head-case vengeful truck driver with the brilliance to plan three steps ahead of his intended victims and seemingly teleport unseen (along with his rig) to wherever he needs to be on cue, all the while knowing precisely how they will react, what route they will flee, their location at all times, and a slew of other utter nonsense, then I cannot recommend this. If you are young, and unrealistic fantasy scripts are of no concern to you, enjoy the presentation, though you are better off watching one of the aforementioned. I reckon every generation needs to have its special adaptation remake though, to be hip (and save on the writer's expense).

Otherwise, a relatively tame film made 30 years ago that still holds up well. Most of the special effects are not CGI and therefore very clever use of full size and miniature models, puppetry, stop-motion, and make-up. (The Sandworm World is CGI.) Alec Baldwin and Genna Davis play the hapless couple who don't realize that they are dead and have to call Betelgeuse (pronounced Beetlejuice) to exorcise the living from their own house. We all know who that is going to be. Michael Keaton has a field day dancing around and playing his devilishly dead self. Winona Ryder is the young creepy daughter of the new owners of the house. At first, she is the only one that will see the ghostly inhabitants who are really just nice friendly spirits. Curious mis-casting with Dick Cavett and Robert Goulet in terrible, minor roles. It's fun, slow in spots, and yet seems way too short at the end. I love the witch doctor, the guy with the shrunken head, and the 2-piece (she is sawed in half) magician's assistant, all siting there in the afterlife waiting room, for their social worker to help them. Everyone appears there exactly as they died. The man with the tire-treads on him looks a bit flat. The girl with green make-up. Not for little kids, due to the great make-up\/effects and cuss word. Danny Elfman's haunting musical score is the best! Don't ya just hate sandworms?

Post World War I and per World War II adds intrigue to the mystery. Madeleine Carroll plays the female love interest and the young Dame Peggy Ashcroft has a small role. This is on Sir Alfred Hitchcock's earlier classics. Donat is wonderful as he goes to Scotland and comes back to London, England. There is also great humor in this film as a backdrop.

I can see it done from the film version based on a novel of the same name. It's one his earlier and memorable films.
