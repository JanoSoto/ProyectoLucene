But she still pulls it off. My favorite scene was the Exorcist impersonation.One of the notable things about the movie is that they were originally going to call it Killing Mrs. Tingle but had to change the title after the Columbine shootings. No matter, it still comes out OK, although it's not the movie that I would recommend above all others.Also starring Michael McKean and Lesley Ann Warren. Director Kevin Williamson wrote the first two Scream movies.
