When the wealthy father of a recent Princeton grad chats Tom up, Tom pretends to know the son and is soon offered $1,000 to go to Italy to convince Dickie Greenleaf to return home. In Italy, Tom attaches himself to Dickie and to Marge, Dickie's cultured fiancée, pretending to love jazz and harboring homoerotic hopes as he soaks in luxury. Besides lying, Tom's talents include impressions and forgery, so when the handsome and confident Dickie tires of Tom, dismissing him as a bore, Tom goes to extreme lengths to make Greenleaf's privileges his own. Roger Ebert wrote The movie is an intelligent a thriller as you'll see this year. It is also insidious in the way it leads us to identify with Tom Ripley. He is the protagonist, we see everything through his eyes, and Dickie is not especially lovable; that means we are a co-conspirator in situations where it seems inconceivable that Tom's deception will not be discovered. He's a monster, but we want him to get away with it. There is one sequence in the film involving an apartment, a landlady, the police and a friend who knows the real Dickie that depends on such meticulous timing and improvisation that if you made it speedier, you'd have the Marx Brothers.

In the final instalment of the Godfather Trilogy, an aging Don Michael Corleone seeks to legitimize his crime family's interests and remove himself from the violent underworld but is kept back by the ambitions of the young. While he attempts to link the Corleone's finances with the Vatican, Michael must deal with the machinations of a hungrier gangster seeking to upset the existing Mafioso order and a young protégé's love affair with his daughter. Roger Ebert wrote And so here we are back again, in the rich, deep brown rooms inhabited by the Corleone family, the rooms filled with shadows and memories, and regretful decisions that people may have to die. We have been taught this world so well by Francis Ford Coppola that we enter it effortlessly has there ever before been a film saga so seductive and compelling, so familiar to us that even after years we remember all of the names of the players? Here, for example, is a new character, introduced as Sonny's illegitimate son, and, yes, we nod like cousins at a family reunion, yes, he does seem a lot like Sonny. In my opinion it is a good film, not great, but certainly better then what people will have you believe. The reason why I believe it gets so much criticism is because the bar was raised so high due to the other two wonderful films in the trilogy. I thought it was a great ending to the trilogy.

Connie Sumner has a loving husband, a beautiful home, and a wonderful son, but she wants more. When she's approached one day by a handsome stranger while trying to hail a taxi, she becomes obsessed with him and eventually starts an affair. But her selfish actions soon catch up with her. Roger Ebert wrote The movie was directed by Adrian Lyne, best known for higher- voltage films like Fatal Attraction and Indecent Proposal.'' This film is based on La Femme Infidele (1969) by Claude Chabrol, which itself is an update of Madame Bovary. Lyne's film is juicier and more passionate than Chabrol's, but both share the fairly daring idea of showing a plot that is entirely about illicit passion and its consequences in a happy marriage. Although cops turn up from time to time in Unfaithful, this is not a crime story, but a marital tragedy. Richard Gere and Diane Lane are well-suited to the roles, exuding a kind of serene materialism that seems happily settled in suburbia. It is all the more shocking when Lane revisits Martel's apartment because there is no suggestion that she is unhappy with Gere, starved for sex, or especially impulsive. She goes back up there because--well, because she wants to. He's quite a guy. On one visit he shows her The Joy of Cooking in Braille. And then his fingers brush hers as if he's reading The Joy of Sex on her skin. Gere's performance was incredible, as was Lane's. Overall, a surprisingly intelligent and moving look at infidelity and it's consequences on an otherwise stable and comfortable family. Lane's performance is tremendous and the script offers an incisive look at the dynamics of the couples relationship as the affair progresses, and after, as tragic events unfold. Although the film does veer into conventional thriller territory eventually, the film always tends towards reality rather than genre\/movie logic, and the ending is wonderfully ambiguous.

His films are pure, with little confidence in symbols and egghead analysis. It is said that he treated his actors like cattle but the payoff is that he treated his audience like gold. He made his films for the public, he made them entertaining and he made films with characters that at least approximate human intelligence.Rear Window is mounted on an idea of complete simplicity. A man is trapped in one location, an island &#x96; in this case, a wheelchair. Jimmy Stewart plays L.B. Jefferies &#x96; Jeff to his friends &#x96; a traveling photographer who is in a state of confinement after an accident. A brilliant tracking shot gives us the entirety of his predicament as we see his broken camera and a photo of an airborne racecar tumbling right at Jefferies' lens.Jeff's days of confinement are spent staring out of his window, which like all others, are open due to the intense heat. He takes daily inventory of the tenants in the apartments across the tightly packed courtyard. His travels haven't given him much time to get to know his neighbors. There's the lady he calls Ms. Torso, a party girl who has a steady stream of gentlemen callers. There's the couple who live on the top floor who lower their dog in a basket to the garden below. There's Ms. Lonelyhearts, a sad spinster who has dinner with imaginary dates or gets dressed up to go to the restaurant across the street and pretend she's expecting someone. There are the newlyweds who pull the shade and rarely come up for air. There's the frustrated musician whose labor bears no fruit. And there's burly Mr. Thorwald who has an invalid wife and a marriage that seems to consist mainly of tolerance.The habits of Jeff's neighbors become routine and then one day he notices that Mrs. Thorwald has disappeared. Later that night, he sees Mr. Thorwald wandering in and out of his apartment during a rainstorm. Jeff's curiosity centers on a few vital clues that lead him to believe that this man may have killed his wife. First comes a large suitcase, then the appearance of a saw, then a change in the arrangement of Thorwald's flowerbed.Jeff's mounting suspicions come only from what he observes from his window. He's in a wheelchair so his visual plane is limited and Hitchcock never allows us to see anything that Jeff can't see. We become participants because Hitch puts us in the wheelchair with him. Close-ups are provided first through a large pair of binoculars, then through Jeff's telephoto lens which allows us to see with clarity. There is no musical score (the only music comes from the musician's apartment) so all of the sounds are natural. This allows the sounds coming from Thorwald's apartment to be muted so that we think we know what we are hearing, but we aren't sure. We strain to listen, to hear some hint of what is being said, but it is to no avail (closed captions don't help).Jeff's state of immobility is the anchor of the story. Everything that Thorwald does seems to make sense if one just rationalizes it long enough. When he binds a trunk with heavy ropes and then has it picked up, we suspect that it contains his wife's body. When Mrs. Thorwald's purse appears in a window we suspect foul play because what woman would leave it behind? When Jeff's detective friend goes to investigate, he comes back with a very reasonable, rational explanation that punches a hole in all of the evidence. Yet we have been drawn in, and we have invested so much in Jeff's belief that we become a participant ourselves. Lisa (Grace Kelly), Jeff's gorgeous fiancé, and Stella (Thelma Ritter) his level-headed nurse, at first scold him for peeping on his neighbors but eventually they become participants themselves. They, in a sense, become our point of view, disgusted by what Jeff is doing but eventually curious.This is a film of limited characters, and one of those characters is the setting itself. It is important that the set feel like an additional character. The courtyard and the building across the way create a feeling of tight, closed-in space. It was a brilliant touch to set the film in the heat of summer so that all those windows are opened so that we get the noise of each apartment and we are able to peer in on each tenant. We can't see the street on the other side, since it is obscured nor can we see the other tenements on Jeff's side of the building. We see only what we need to so the mystery is held in our minds just as it is in Jeff's mind.Rear Window is Hitchcock at his best, toying with our expectations and then not only giving us what we expect but a great deal more. He is a puppeteer pulling the strings in such a way that the ending doesn't come as a surprise but doesn't come to any false conclusions. The final confrontation with Thorwald is not just tossed into the plot, it is built on everything we've seen before.

After the opening of the film, it works its way backwards to show how we got to this point. Slowly, the entire plot is shown in flashbacks that reflect the character's 15-minute memory. There is also another timeline shot in black in white that happens in chronological order, a true showcase of Nolan's skill as a director. We learn that his wife was killed in a break-in that left him with a head injury leaving his long-term memory intact but unable to make new memories. He is bent on catching his wife's killer, which proves to be a difficult task given his condition. Before his memory resets, he takes annotated Polaroid's and tattoos himself with clues to which he is after, and what his situation is. However, this allows for him to be manipulated by those around him, and even himself. In his mostly positive review of the film, Roger Ebert seemed to discover a huge plot hole. How does he remember that he was short-term memory loss if the last thing he remembers is his wife's death? That seems like a legitimate observation that should discredit the film's cleverness. However, his memory of this is triggered by a tattoo on his hand of the name of another man (who becomes very important later) who had the same condition. Anyway&#x85; where was I? Oh! Memento is a brilliant, mind-mending film that works both as a thriller and a psychological drama.

Young Trevor McKinney, troubled by his mother's alcoholism and fears of his abusive but absent father, is caught up by an intriguing assignment from his new social studies teacher, Mr. Simonet. The assignment think of something to change the world and put it into action. Trevor conjures the notion of paying a favor not back, but forward--repaying good deeds not with payback, but with new good deeds done to three new people. Trevor's efforts to make good on his idea bring a revolution not only in the lives of himself, his mother and his physically and emotionally scarred teacher, but in those of an ever-widening circle of people completely unknown to him. Roger Ebert wrote With a cleaner story line, the basic idea could have been free to deliver.

I believed in them and cared for them. I wish the movie could have gotten out of their way. At its best, this is a film which may just do the impossible inspiring one to good deeds, without expectation of reward or remuneration. That alone is a substantial achievement.

It is one of the most confusing, purposely fragmented, hard to follow stories ever filmed. It is extremely hard to make sense of. But if you can follow it, the rewards are immense.The basic premise is simple enough; a man seeks revenge for the death of his wife. But Leonard (Guy Pierce), the man in question, has no short term memory. And the scenes take place in reverse order, with each scene ending where the last scene started. The beginning is the ending, the ending is the beginning. And if that weren't enough, there's a second sequence of events which take place before the main story and are shown in chronological order, and the film constantly cuts back and forth between them. If you're confused at this point you should be; this is the kind of non-linear storytelling even most comic books won't touch.When I say that Leonard has no short term memory, it means that anything that happens to him will be gone in a matter of minutes faces, names, where he is, what he's doing. The only memories he has are those from before the injury that gave him his condition, the last of those being the death of his wife and the injury itself. This means that he, and by extension we, don't know anything about what's happening except what's scribbled on pieces of paper or tattooed to his body. And the real kick is that he doesn't know where or when he received any of this information, so there's no real way for him to know what, if anything is true.And because the entire film moves backwards, we don't know how he or any of the other characters arrived at their present situations. We don't really know how long he's been hunting for the killer, why he came to this town, how he met the people who are helping him, or anything else. All we have is what we can infer from the beginning, (which is actually the ending) and I don't think I'm giving anything away by saying that much of that will be completely wrong. The paradox of this movie is that we don't have any idea what's next because we don't know what came before, and what's next is what came before. And if you can make any sense out of what I've just said, good for you because that's more than I can say for myself.Honestly, Memento almost makes Inception seem simple. The whole time you're watching you're aware that it doesn't seem to make any sense and that you don't know what's happening or why. But you keep watching because you want to understand. You're intrigued by Leonard and his quest for vengeance, and you want to know the answers. And whenever a question is answered another is posed, and every revelation throws what you think you know out the window. This movie is truly mind-bending in the very best sense of the word. And when you finally get to the ending (which is the beginning) you will be completely blown away by what you learn, and even more so by what is still in doubt.Like I said, this is a weird one. It's fragmented, scrambled, incredibly complicated and at times borders on incomprehensible. But it raises as many important questions about the nature of memories and the human mind as the best psychology or philosophy lecture. And for the intelligent, strong stomached film-goer, it will all be worth it in the end. I would expect nothing less from Christopher Nolan.

Based on a true story that was claimed by writer Jay Anson, The Amityville Horror is about a large house on the coast of Long Island where newly weds George and Kathy Lutz and their three children move into the house that they hope will be their dream house but it ends up in terror. Despite full disclosure by the real estate agent of the home's history, George and Kathy buy the house. George says, Houses don't have memories, but they turn to their family priest Father Delaney who believes the house is haunted and performs an exorcism on the house. But the evil spirit in the house causes him to become blind and makes him very ill. George and Kathy with the help of another priest Father Bolen and a police detective they face the fears of the house, but not knowing the spirit is planning to possess George and then the children. Roger Ebert wrote The problem with The Amityville Horror is that, in a very real sense, there's nothing there. We watch two hours of people being frightened and dismayed, and we ask ourselves... what for? If it's real, let it have happened to them. Too bad, Lutzes! If it's made up, make it more entertaining. If they can't make up their minds... why should we? The Amityville Horror has remained one of the 70's better horror oddities, and has become a cult classic for good reason. The Amityville Horror is a classic haunted house movie that has stood the test of time and is still rated as one of the best ghost stories ever filmed. I can easily recommend to anyone that is intrigued with haunted places and creepy horror movies. The movie is not perfect but it is still good.

Some times when a film company makes a sequel they use the same formula from the previous film. Usually this is done because there is not quite the time to develop a completely unique plot. An example of this would be the Batman franchise. There were three years between the first Batman and then Batman Returns and three years between Returns and Forever. All three films whether you liked them or not were unique and different. Then they cut the time by a year and they rushed Batman and Robin which followed the blueprint of Forever. Not entirely the same movie, but you see the similarities as the film follows the same flow. Another example is Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters II. This one is a bit more perplexing as they had five years between films, so while you can see that it is following the same flow as the first film, I am still not so sure why they did it. Now for this film...at the end of The Spy Who Loved Me it states that Bond will return in For Your Eyes Only. Instead, the film is Moonraker, a film with a plot, villain which are very much like those found in The Spy Who Loved Me; heck, this film even has the same henchman in Jaws. Obviously, they wanted to put Bond in space because of films like Close Encounters and Star Wars and while the film was put together hastily it performed quite well at the box office and was actually a very good Bond film. Just not as good as the film whose formula it follows.The story has a space shuttle being hijacked midair as it rides on the back of a plane. Seems it was under British care so now they have to send Bond out to find what happened to the shuttle. This leads him to the maker of the shuttle, a man known as Drax who is obsessed with the conquest of space. Bond will travel the world to find out what happened and things begin to get very sinister when he finds a strange room in a glass factory in Venice where a very potent poison is being manufactured. Bond's final stop takes him into the stars as he must infiltrate Drax's space station...built in secret and containing a very deadly secret indeed.This film has loads of action and fun. Roger Moore does great once again as Bond, and the other characters are good too. Just seems they did not really get too many big stars to be in this one as Richard Kiel as Jaws is one of the few actors I know other than the normal Bond regulars. I believe this was Bernard Lee's last Bond film as M. There are scads of Bond girls in this one and Louis Chiles is okay, but she is not in the same league with Barbara Bach. Heck, out of all the girls in this film, the most attractive one for me was the very short blond who Jaws falls in love with...she certainly had the best bosom of the lot.So this film was very fun and good, but it does have a bit of a been there done that feel to it as well. However, not so much that it detracts from the movie in a majorly significant way. This film also contains more comedy than did Spy as Jaws goes from being a very dangerous foe who kills to a bit of a comic relief person. The final scene is a bit strange as it does feature a laser fight in space, but they did a pretty good job considering the lack of time they had to make this film. The laser battle in space almost looks like the one found in Flash Gordon and I wonder if Dino De Laurentiis may have been inspired by it a bit. So in the end, a good Bond film that may have borrowed a bit from Spy, but still manages to be different enough to be entertaining in its own way.

After complaints about the dark and grim feel of Batman Returns, it was decided that it was time to tone things down and this led to Forever's lighter approach. Joel Schumacher replaced Burton and Val Kilmer stepped in as the dark knight. What we get is a film that feels very different and very loose, but it was a big success and actually has some very good elements. It is the Batman film people call bland and forgettable, but I think that there is something interesting trying to break through the surface and that it is better than Returns. Story Well there are two distinct stories going on here. The main one involving the villains' scheme is daft and makes little sense, while the one concentrating on Bruce and Dick is very well-told. The Riddler, a disgruntled Wayne Enterprises worker, creates a device that can drain brainwaves which can be used to make him smarter and he teams up with Two-Face to fund his scheme. This whole plan is like something from the 60's TV show and is just used to get the villains on screen together because it makes little sense. Elsewhere, acrobat Dick Grayson's parents are killed by Two-Face and Bruce tries to steer him away from a life of revenge. Now this story is great, the relationship seems genuine and the themes of revenge are handled excellently. We also get a greater look at the psychology of Bruce Wayne, giving us more insight than either of the two previous films.Batman\/Bruce Wayne Here's a contentious point, I think Val Kilmer is a really good Batman. I think that he balances out both aspects better than anyone else has. His Wayne is believable as a suave, good- looking playboy while having that haunted edge. His Batman is mysterious and more heroic than any other on-screen version. He looks the part in and out of the suit too. With better writing he could have been the definitive Batman and it's a shame he only got one shot at it.Villains All I can say is that Tommy Lee Jones butchers Two-Face. He's Two-Face for about 30 seconds, as soon as he say's ''luck'' he goes off the deep end and never looks back. Face is basically a Joker knock- off as all he does is run around laughing manically and no aspects of his duality are played up. It's not only a massive waste of a great character, but of Jones as well as he could have been perfect for the part. Jim Carrey is&#x85;.well Jim Carrey with a hint of Frank Gorshin. He is very entertaining and clearly trying his best so I'll give him that, but his Riddler is just too crazed and holds none of the menace the character should. It was too tailored towards his acting and written differently I think the role could have been pulled it off well.Support Nicole Kidman is forgettable as psychiatrist Dr. Meridian. To be fair the character is just there for Bruce to be interested in and is given almost nothing to do but look pretty. Chris O'Donnell does a good job as Grayson, even if he looks a bit old. He handles the weighty material well and has chemistry with Kilmer. Michael Gough is excellent once again as a gentler Alfred, while Pat Hingle is dull as Gordon and has little to do throughout.Action The fight scenes here are a lot better than those in the Burton films. Batman frequently fights many foes using a variety of methods and gadgets which broadens his abilities nicely. The entire opening battle with Two-Face is fantastic and the fight at the party is enjoyable too.Music Elliot Goldenthal comes in for the music and, though it's not as good as Elfman's scores, he does a rather good job. His main theme is a good replacement. Production First off, the film does look fantastic. It really does look like a comic book come to life and the use of colour as well as lighting is spectacular. Gotham City also feels less set bound than before and some of the ambitious locations used look great, especially for the time. One problem is some of the writing, which can come off as clunky and awkward. Batman saying things like ''Chicks love the car'' is just ridiculous and so out of character. The Riddler's dialogue is mostly jokes, but then again that is Jim Carrey, and Two-Face adds nothing of interest. Yet when the writing does concentrate on Bruce it can be really good and, as said, we get a more in-depth look at Bruce which is great. The costumes are well made, the Bat suit is probably the best on-screen one and Robin's suit looks really good as well. The villain costumes are a bit over-the-top, Carrey in a spandex is just weird, but they serve a purpose.Conclusion Batman Forever is much mangled, but is nowhere near as bad as most people say. Of course it has problems as said some of the writing is daft, the villains are overblown and it is heading into a campy direction which would be turned up to eleven in Batman & Robin. But it does have a lot of good things that many overlook. Val Kilmer is a great lead, the Robin arch is done well, it looks at Bruce Wayne a lot more and the action is enjoyably big. I see it as a sort of guilty pleasure in a way, there's problems with it but there's also some really good stuff that is worth watching the silly moments for. Overall it's not as strange or nonsensical as Returns and it's not as mind-blowingly camp as Batman & Robin, it has just the right balance.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"},{"date":"6 January 2015","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Batman Forever represented a major change in style for Batman films at that point. After complaints about the dark and grim feel of Batman Returns, it was decided that it was time to tone things down and this led to Forever's lighter approach. Joel Schumacher replaced Burton and Val Kilmer stepped in as the dark knight. What we get is a film that feels very different and very loose, but it was a big success and actually has some very good elements. It is the Batman film people call bland and forgettable, but I think that there is something interesting trying to break through the surface and that it is better than Returns. Story Well there are two distinct stories going on here. The main one involving the villains' scheme is daft and makes little sense, while the one concentrating on Bruce and Dick is very well-told. The Riddler, a disgruntled Wayne Enterprises worker, creates a device that can drain brainwaves which can be used to make him smarter and he teams up with Two-Face to fund his scheme. This whole plan is like something from the 60's TV show and is just used to get the villains on screen together because it makes little sense. Elsewhere, acrobat Dick Grayson's parents are killed by Two-Face and Bruce tries to steer him away from a life of revenge. Now this story is great, the relationship seems genuine and the themes of revenge are handled excellently. We also get a greater look at the psychology of Bruce Wayne, giving us more insight than either of the two previous films.Batman\/Bruce Wayne Here's a contentious point, I think Val Kilmer is a really good Batman. I think that he balances out both aspects better than anyone else has. His Wayne is believable as a suave, good- looking playboy while having that haunted edge. His Batman is mysterious and more heroic than any other on-screen version. He looks the part in and out of the suit too. With better writing he could have been the definitive Batman and it's a shame he only got one shot at it.Villains All I can say is that Tommy Lee Jones butchers Two-Face. He's Two-Face for about 30 seconds, as soon as he say's ''luck'' he goes off the deep end and never looks back. Face is basically a Joker knock- off as all he does is run around laughing manically and no aspects of his duality are played up. It's not only a massive waste of a great character, but of Jones as well as he could have been perfect for the part. Jim Carrey is&#x85;.well Jim Carrey with a hint of Frank Gorshin. He is very entertaining and clearly trying his best so I'll give him that, but his Riddler is just too crazed and holds none of the menace the character should. It was too tailored towards his acting and written differently I think the role could have been pulled it off well.Support Nicole Kidman is forgettable as psychiatrist Dr. Meridian. To be fair the character is just there for Bruce to be interested in and is given almost nothing to do but look pretty. Chris O'Donnell does a good job as Grayson, even if he looks a bit old. He handles the weighty material well and has chemistry with Kilmer. Michael Gough is excellent once again as a gentler Alfred, while Pat Hingle is dull as Gordon and has little to do throughout.Action The fight scenes here are a lot better than those in the Burton films. Batman frequently fights many foes using a variety of methods and gadgets which broadens his abilities nicely. The entire opening battle with Two-Face is fantastic and the fight at the party is enjoyable too.Music Elliot Goldenthal comes in for the music and, though it's not as good as Elfman's scores, he does a rather good job. His main theme is a good replacement. Production First off, the film does look fantastic. It really does look like a comic book come to life and the use of colour as well as lighting is spectacular. Gotham City also feels less set bound than before and some of the ambitious locations used look great, especially for the time. One problem is some of the writing, which can come off as clunky and awkward. Batman saying things like ''Chicks love the car'' is just ridiculous and so out of character. The Riddler's dialogue is mostly jokes, but then again that is Jim Carrey, and Two-Face adds nothing of interest. Yet when the writing does concentrate on Bruce it can be really good and, as said, we get a more in-depth look at Bruce which is great. The costumes are well made, the Bat suit is probably the best on-screen one and Robin's suit looks really good as well. The villain costumes are a bit over-the-top, Carrey in a spandex is just weird, but they serve a purpose.Conclusion Batman Forever is much mangled, but is nowhere near as bad as most people say. Of course it has problems as said some of the writing is daft, the villains are overblown and it is heading into a campy direction which would be turned up to eleven in Batman & Robin. But it does have a lot of good things that many overlook. Val Kilmer is a great lead, the Robin arch is done well, it looks at Bruce Wayne a lot more and the action is enjoyably big. I see it as a sort of guilty pleasure in a way, there's problems with it but there's also some really good stuff that is worth watching the silly moments for. Overall it's not as strange or nonsensical as Returns and it's not as mind-blowingly camp as Batman & Robin, it has just the right balance.

And if it was a rule, it was not followed in this 1935 movie, because an unmarried man and woman get in a double bed and spend the night with all four feet on the bed. Part of the reason may have to do with the fact that the movie was made in the United Kingdom. Maybe their censorship rules were different, and America just went along. Also, it probably helped that the man and woman are antagonistic toward each other, sleeping together only because of handcuffs, so that there is not the slightest suggestion that they will have sex with each other.At the end of the movie, Hannay calls out to Mr. Memory during a performance, asking, What are the 39 steps? to which Mr. Memory begins to answer before he is shot, thereby leading to the capture of the man who shot him, who heads the organization of spies. We have to wonder why Mr. Memory started answering the question. We suspect there are two reasons first, Mr. Memory was a somewhat unwilling participant in the spy ring (blackmail?); and second, his pride in being able to answer any factual question that was put to him made him unable to say, I don't know.But that started me thinking.

This feels much more like a Tim Burton project and much less like an actual Batman film. Batman is here of course, but he has a much more subdued role to play in proceedings and Returns likes to concentrate on its villains a lot more than it does on the caped crusader. It became infamous at the time due to many complaining about its violence and grim tone. Yet that's not the issue, the first film had a dark tone, as the problems lie with the storyline and the ideas the film tries to bring to life.Story The bizarre story features the Penguin, deformed and abandoned as a child, rise from the sewers and attempt to become mayor of Gotham with the help of shady businessman Max Shreck. Elsewhere, Catwoman is created after Shreck attempts to kill his secretary and she causes havoc around Gotham. It's up to Batman to find out their plans and stop them. The plot is all over the place and makes little sense. It doesn't make sense why the Penguin would want to be mayor and Catwoman has no motivation to do what see does. Batman just seems to be shoehorned into things as the villains are given no reason to be against him and he barely gets any screen time, again this is meant to be Batman 'Returns'.Batman Keaton returns and he's given very little to do here. His Batman is still enjoyably mysterious and brooding, even if he is too cruel. His Bruce Wayne is pretty dull and doesn't act like Wayne should, he's too awkward and not the charismatic playboy we should expect. There's not enough separation with both roles either, when he's Bruce he just acts like Batman without the mask. He doesn't get enough screen time to make a big impression and has no arch which just makes him feel wasted.Villains Danny DeVito plays the grotesque Penguin and he's nothing like the Penguin should be. It's just a bad character, he's just a freak and has none of the wit or charm needed for the role. We don't feel sorry for him and we don't care about his plight because the character is unsympathetic. DeVito gets into the role and looks ideal, but that's it. Michelle Pfeiffer is having fun as Catwoman and looks fantastic, but once again this isn't the true Catwoman. She isn't a thief and her interest in Batman seems like it was thrown in at the last minute. As said, her motivations make little sense and she just isn't that interesting to begin with. A disgruntled secretary who wants to try to get revenge on her boss, it's pretty weak for a Batman film.Support Christopher Walken is wasted as Shreck. He's a wonderful actor and could have been superb in a creepy role, but Shreck has no substance. If you took the character out then it wouldn't make much of a difference. Michael Gough is great again and is given a little more to do here which is nice. Pat Hingle is given even less to do than before and his Gordon is useless, he has about 4 lines and his relationship with Batman is non-existent.Action Burton isn't great at shooting action and it shows here. The opening fight scene is clumsy and just has Batman letting the Batmobile do all of the work. The little fights with Catwoman are pretty daft and the climax just has things exploding which gets dull. The issue is that Batman does a lot of un-Batman things here. He sets some guy on fire, plants a bomb on another and throws acid at Catwoman. It's very distracting and so out of place.Music Danny Elfman's score is easily one of the highlights of the film. It is a lot more subdued, brooding and darker than before with some wonderfully haunting melodies as well as some suitably upbeat stuff when needed. It perfectly fits the wintery, Gothic look that the film possesses. I'd go as far as to say that this is Elfman's best score.Production The best thing about the film is its look. The cinematography is truly spectacular. The sets look aptly gloomy and some of the building designs look great, especially Wayne Manor. The idea to set it at Christmas is also really clever as we get many beautifully atmospheric shots of snow falling and the wintery landscapes. The scene at the party with Bruce and Selina is done well too. Yet, similar to the following two films the writing gets silly. I don't want to hear Penguin spewing sexual puns like there's no tomorrow and Batman looks dumbfounded far too much (just look at his failure to save the Ice Princess). It too out of character and it's hard to know what the writers were thinking. There's no big set-pieces either here which harm the film. The opening with the Penguin as Moses is flat and nothing exciting happens in the climax. Conclusion At the end of the day Batman Returns is a very flawed film. It has good elements as the look it goes for is wonderful and the score is brilliant, but it has so many daft parts. People point the finger at Schumacher but there's a lot of campy stuff here. A lot of people claim that the film is too dark, but I think that's it just too strange and daft for its own good. Most of the acting is iffy, the plot makes no sense, the action is uninspired and Batman is just a background player in his own film.

Devil's Advocate thematically raises the preposition that 'is winning everything' in the legal profession.Does a lawyer commits the basic sin of Vanity if he believes his job is to win, as Kevin does. Further the movie in John Milton's trenchant speech questions the very notion of righteousness in the post-modern world. Milton's speech rips apart the whole discourse of religion when he presents the inherent contradiction of it. Kevin's dilemma reflects the modern man who accuses the circumstances for being what he is,the culture dominated by making money 'which build egos of the size of cathedral', the question is can one really call what one does 'freely-willed'?. The movie deals with these 'Hamltian questions' in a lawyer's mind. Roger Ebert wrote I liked the way Hackford used speeded-up photography, as in Koyaanisqatsi, to indicate the passage of time. The way Milton's office looks like Satan's might look if he had a great designer. The nice little throwaways as when the goat killer (Delroy Lindo) apparently causes the prosecutor to have a coughing fit. The casting is good in small roles, including Heather Matarazzo, from Welcome to the Dollhouse, as the victim in an early courtroom scene. But the movie never fully engaged me; my mind raced ahead of the plot, and the John Grisham stuff clashed with the Exorcist stuff. Still, I enjoyed Pacino. Looking less deeply wrinkled than of late, his face smooth with Satanic self- contentment, he relishes the details, such as that Milton likes to stand in front of fires and always travels by subway. The phantasmagorical final confrontation between the two men, set to the Sinatra version of It Happened in Monterey, ranges from melodrama to camp (You're the anti-Christ! Whatever.) It includes an extraordinary special effect of a marble bas relief that comes to life and melts into a licentious orgy. If the whole film were as good as its production design, we'd really have something here. This is a film that I have seen time and again, and it just keeps getting better. The music and cinematography are simply amazing.
