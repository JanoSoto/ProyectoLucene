I knew I had witnessed something special, something life-affirming, and above all a work that contained enough poetry, passion, and humanity for two movies. But I also felt as if there was something missing here and there. So, once the complete TV version was released, as with Scenes from a Marriage, I jumped at the opportunity to view it in its entirety. Broken up here into 5 Acts, Bergman takes another semi-autobiographical approach to his storytelling, and it's a sumptuous tale of a turn of the 20th Century family (the Ekdahls, comprising of Oscar and Emilie, the parents, Fanny and Alexander, the kids- Alexander being mostly the driving force behind the story- and also the other relatives Carl and Gustov Adolf, brothers of Oscar, Helena, Alma, Lydia, and also the housemaid Maj) who own a theater company.What makes Fanny and Alexander work as a major achievement, if anything else for my money is that all the elements seem balanced out over the acts, with story and characters, each sharply defined. The first act unfolds with attention to the little details and the more prevalent ones in a family gathering. A key speech made by Oscar is a haunting bit of foreshadowing before they set off for the family dinner. This scene, involving more or less two dozen people, is sometimes very funny, sometimes a little unnerving, and towards the end depressing. But scenes such as these reveal how wonderful and exciting Bergman can be with his material and actors- despite it taking place in 1907, you can see these people in modern settings just as easily. There's also the scene involving Oscar with his children before they go to sleep, in which he tells them a story, which ranks as one of the more memorable, touching scenes of the film - from here, we can understand how this brings to Alexander (Bertil Guve, in a performance that is touching by being so straightforward with the innocence of child-hood) to the state he's in for much of the rest of the picture.Then the second and third acts come around, and the tragedy unfolds as penetrating as I've seen in any film, much less from Bergman. It wouldn't spoil it to say that Oscar succumbs to an illness, and passes away. From here, Emilie (Ewa Fr√∂ling, a performance meant for Liv Ullman, which she fits just as well) tries to go on as usual, and it just doesn't feel the same. She seeks counsel from the village bishop, Edvard Vergerus (Jan Malmsjo, previously in Bergman's Scenes from a Marriage), and subsequently falls in love with him, or at least thinks she does. They get married, and the children are forced into leaving (almost) everything behind to live at his dreary, caged residence, a far cry from where they once lived, a place lush with colors and life in the rooms. Both of these assets are provided by an Oscar winning production design team, and the foundations of how these two, including as well the theater, display how period-perfect some of this can be.The last two acts are when things get rough, which is a standard Bergman is known for. This kind of standard, if I could call it such, includes his personal connection to the Christian church, in particular with his father being a Lutheran priest. I'm not guessing on how fact based Bishop Vergerus is to Bergman's life, and I really don't want to either. One of the things I loved about the film (than some likely hated on it's original release- I know, for example, that my father was devastated after watching this film) is how the good and the bad, or what could be seen as good and bad, are paired off, and how the middle-ground is just as clear or un-clear. Emilie is a good person, wanting the best for her children and for herself, but she doesn't know how to do that without someone to bring guidance when she cannot after grieving for her dead husband (who appears sometimes to Alexander, which is another matter). Alexander, who is a child raised with all the enthusiasm to express himself as such by his uncles and particularly his theatrical father Oscar, is good but lending himself to not being too firm on what's real and what is not. The Bishop, on the other hand, is one who, as he says at one point has only one mask. His is a puritanical approach, who sees imagination in only one strict aspect, and has terms of love that are by his code of living and understanding of people. Veregus, along with his family that live in fear and suffering (Harriet Andersson's character, and with the character of the heavy, ill aunt), know little is anything about how the Ekdahls have lived. What ends up happening, even from the get-go of the third act, in the fourth and fifth acts Bergman reveals Bishop Veregus to be an immense antagonist, one that allows just enough sympathy in one or two spots to not throw something at the TV, but with the kind of language that only the most terrifying of movie characters possess. Bottom line, this character, whether you like the film or not, is one of Bergman's greatest creations, and is pulled off by Malmjso with icy, disturbing perfection; it's one of the most memorable of the kind in film I can think of, right up there with Nurse Ratched, HAL 9000, and Darth Vader.But what torment and anguish the characters, as well as much of the audience, seem to endure in the fourth\/fifth acts; there also comes revelatory moments of sheer beauty and enchantment. A couple of scenes involving Alexander in the puppet shop, for example, display a level of artistry that goes between Bunuel and Disney. And a particular, long soliloquy by Isak (Erland Josephsson, not under-used at all) to the children is a poem unto itself that gives me an idea that Bergman had he not gone into theater and film, would've been one of the great poets of the 20th century. As the catharsis comes, it comes with a kind of justice that works in the only way it satisfyingly could have. With the fates of the Bishop, Emilie, and Alexander and Fanny brought to a close, as with the Grandmother, the uncles and aunts, and so on, it's all very symbolic, metaphorical, and real, and it gels together.One last note- Sven Nykvist, who one his second Oscar with Bergman for this film, creates the kinds of shots that some could only have in their dreams. When he visualizes something for Bergman with the forces of light and dark, with the subtlety and nuance, it's all the better. To put this all in another way, I could go on and on about this huge, heart-rendering work, but it all comes down to this- as an emotional, intellectual, and spiritual (surprisingly for me, who sees religion as a kind of fantasy) sort of film-viewing experience, Fanny and Alexander is one of the most profound I've ever had. Some may feel the same; some may want to forget they ever experienced it. But one thing the film does is stick with you, if only for a little while, and that's really what a film can and should do....by the way, the 5-hour version, at least in America, is only available on a high-priced special edition DVD pack from Criterion, but for the viewer who's already a fan of the film, it makes for a great holiday gift.

A B-movie can be fun, campy, corny enough to be entertaining... but the new ones aren't that. They're just bad, pure and simple. This film really doesn't have anything at all going for it... except for maybe the big names in the cast. The plot is ludicrous... the writers probably didn't even consider making it plausible... at all. Breeding super-intelligent sharks in order to cure Alzheimer's disease? Oh, come on. The pacing is awful, the movie is very, very hard to sit through. The characters are poorly written stereotypes and clich√©s. The acting is mostly mediocre, but a few performances go even lower and almost hit rock bottom. The special effects are laughable. They're among the worst I've ever seen... and that says quite a lot, believe me. The sharks aren't the least bit scary... I was never scared of them. They look so terribly fake. The film tries to be original by never really killing anyone when we expect them to die... every time someone looks like they're about to die, they survive. If everything is quiet... expect someone to die. Once, they even went to the trouble of having a character go into a deep, meaningful monologue just to set up a giant shock for the audience... which is all the movie is about, anyway. Shocking the audience. If you ask Renny Harlin what he wanted to achieve through this film, I'm sure his answer would be to scare people. That's it. No message, no symbolism. Just a bunch of scares in an empty movie. The worst thing about it is, we know exactly who's going to die. We may even know the order, if 'we' pay attention(mind you, I did no such thing for at least 95% of the movie, if you add up how many seconds I payed attention versus how long the movie was) which leaves only one question; *when* they're going to die. Now, if you think that is enough reason to sit through about 105 minutes of pointless B-movie crap, then this movie is for you. If not, avoid this like the plague. My high rating for this movie must be due to my being in a very good mood today... or maybe I just found laughing at the movie made it deserve more than a 1. Who knows. I recommend this only to fans of new B-movies and possibly fans of the various actors... I would recommend it to fans of director Renny Harlin, but I doubt that they exist.

They're among the worst I've ever seen... and that says quite a lot, believe me. The sharks aren't the least bit scary... I was never scared of them. They look so terribly fake. The film tries to be original by never really killing anyone when we expect them to die... every time someone looks like they're about to die, they survive. If everything is quiet... expect someone to die. Once, they even went to the trouble of having a character go into a deep, meaningful monologue just to set up a giant shock for the audience... which is all the movie is about, anyway. Shocking the audience. If you ask Renny Harlin what he wanted to achieve through this film, I'm sure his answer would be to scare people. That's it. No message, no symbolism. Just a bunch of scares in an empty movie. The worst thing about it is, we know exactly who's going to die. We may even know the order, if 'we' pay attention(mind you, I did no such thing for at least 95% of the movie, if you add up how many seconds I payed attention versus how long the movie was) which leaves only one question; *when* they're going to die. Now, if you think that is enough reason to sit through about 105 minutes of pointless B-movie crap, then this movie is for you. If not, avoid this like the plague. My high rating for this movie must be due to my being in a very good mood today... or maybe I just found laughing at the movie made it deserve more than a 1. Who knows. I recommend this only to fans of new B-movies and possibly fans of the various actors... I would recommend it to fans of director Renny Harlin, but I doubt that they exist.

Did they ever care? This movie is yet another one of these new B-movies, just like Deep Rising and other recent movies which I have avoided due to my lack of tolerance for them. A B-movie can be fun, campy, corny enough to be entertaining... but the new ones aren't that. They're just bad, pure and simple. This film really doesn't have anything at all going for it... except for maybe the big names in the cast. The plot is ludicrous... the writers probably didn't even consider making it plausible... at all. Breeding super-intelligent sharks in order to cure Alzheimer's disease? Oh, come on.

If you thought Truman Burbank had it rough in 'the Truman Show' with the entire world watching his every televised move, then your heart really has to go out to this guy. At the very least, Truman was always able to keep his inner mind sacred and untouched, but poor Malkovich doesn't even have that ability. He's stuck with all these depraved eccentrics, invading his privacy and making a huge pile of dollars at his expense, and he's completely powerless to stop them. That Malkovich is a real-life actor (he even played alongside Cusack before in 'Con Air'), living in this warped, fictional world makes it all the more haunting. It's hard not to come away from this one feeling just a little unnerved &#150; the concept it revolves around is, after all, undeniably grotesque, riddled with plot points which are just plain absurd, and which the characters themselves (except for Malkovich) accept all too readily (for example, why would you be spat out by the side of the New Jersey turnpike of all places?), and the final outcome of their escapade is outrageously creepy and harrowing to say the least - but paradoxically the film is also fun, hilarious and really has its charm.And that, I suppose, is the beauty of BJM - no logic, no ethics, no philosophy (Craig does briefly deliberate on the philosophical implications of his discovery, but is persuaded by Maxine to brush them aside pretty quickly in favour of cashing in on it); just loads of twisted surrealism and great laughs, and a movie so delightfully INSANE that it boggles the mind. There could be a little message somewhere in there about the worldliness of modern society and our materialistic drive to make money out of whatever we can, our human fascination with celebrities and beliefs that their lives are more fulfilling than our own, and, in the case of the oddball old Dr. Lester, refusal to face up to our own mortality, but even there everything is skewered as further dark comedy. The 'morals' of the story are almost a joke, but darn good ones at that, and for best results you really have to detach your mind beforehand, sit back and just enjoy this for being the lavish and crazy piece of farce it invariably is. It's daring, imaginative and wonderfully unconventional, and comes complete with some of the most memorable characterisations of the late 90s (the deep eccentricity of some the characters may cause them to seem a little distant at first, but they do grow on you, and I know that anyone can identify with the dejected puppeteer Craig Schwartz and his struggle for recognition on some level). Granted, a film about a group of people who discover a portal leading into an actor's brain was hardly going to be everyone's cup of Kenco, and I don't anticipate that everyone who sees it will share my enthusiasm, but for those of us who like our movies to be just that bit different, this is a psychotic little masterpiece to be savoured.After all, it's impossible to deny the appeal of a movie where most of the human characters are acting essentially like instinct-driven animals, concerned primarily with self-survival and\/or attracting a mate, contrasting with a subplot which concerns a young chimpanzee gradually learning to come to terms with his repressed childhood trauma. Throw in some of the most brilliantly-timed cameo appearances from Sean Penn and Brad Pitt ever captured on film and you know you have a winner on your hands.

I think she looks cute and sexy in the movie with her weight gain, a dude's opinion) and doesn't have a steady boyfriend until they turn thirty (where the movie began) are those who might willing to settle for a lesser man. But when one of the men in the movie become rude to her or disrespectful to her, she knows what to do. She never go cry to anyone with her relationship problem. She worked at it on her own, may be asking advice from friends on what to say here and there, but never whine about it. There's no why don't you just..., she did everything a smart and intelligent woman would do. Not bad for a girl who thinks El Nino is a latin band.

There's something about the unique persona he brings upon any character he plays in a movie, as if he leaves part of himself behind on the film reel each time. From psychological thrillers like The Silence of the Lambs to emotional dramas, he also strikes me as a modest man and is, in my eyes a true genius!Meet Joe Black is a strange tale that challenges our preconceptions of death.

In addition he established his reputation as the master of suspense, something which remained unchallenged throughout the remainder of his career. In style this film is quintessimal Hitchcock, and those who know his films can pick out sequences in any of his later ones which were based on, or inspired by, his work in this early thriller. Similarly, sequences from this film have also been imitated by many other directors - for example Richard Pearce, in the thriller No Mercy (1986), included sequences that imitated a famous sequence in Hitchcock's film where Robert Donat and Madeleine Carroll were handcuffed together and on the run , by showing Richard Gere and Kim Basinger fleeing pursuers whilst handcuffed together. Because of this The 39 Steps has become a must see classic that most movie buffs still regard as an essential element in their personal film collection.There are two criticisms commonly made of this film. The first is that there are logical imperfections in the story. This is true of almost all Hitchcock films (as well as those of most other directors). The point is that Hitchcock had an unsurpassed ability to maintain a flow in the unfolding of his story on the screen which totally distracts his audience from the type of mental agility required to even be aware of them. Only when dissecting the story on a sequence by sequence basis will such imperfections become significant. The second criticism is that this film, whilst based on John Buchan's novel of the same name, departs very considerably from the story in the book. I am not a purist about this, books and films are totally different media and must be judged independently. In some cases it must be recognised that a book is structured so that it is almost impossible for a film to remain true to the original book. What I do believe is important is that the film-goer should be entitled to know how true a film is to a previously read and perhaps long loved book. If a film is described as the film of the best selling novel........, then it should be as accurate a dramatic presentation of the story in the book as possible. (Where the original is a play, not a book, the dramatic medium is already much closer to the movie form, and I believe such a description should only be used when most of the original dialogue from the play is accurately reproduced in the movie.) By contrast, if a film is described as based on............ then the filmmaker should have considerably more freedom; and if the phrase used is inspired by........ then a largely independent dramatic presentation should be expected. In the case of The 39 Steps, Hichcock's film comes into the latter category, but a later (and in my opinion generally inferior) 1978 film of the same name can legitimately claim to be much more closely based on the book. In this instance I personally do not regard the original book as sufficiently important to be sacrosanct, but those who differ from me about this may feel they have an adequate reason for preferring the 1978 film.Today The 39 Steps is seldom shown in movie theaters and, when a home video rather than the actual film is under consideration, attention needs to be given to the medium and technology with which it has been reproduced. The catch phrase digitally remastered is often used to reassure a purchaser that he is buying the best possible product, but this may be totally irrelevant. The nuances of shade in a good black and white photograph can often be artistically more significant than those of colour in a colour print, and the same is true for many early movies. But home video versions of black and white films are usually disappointing as these nuances are seldom reproduced accurately, if at all. It is regrettable that, largely because of this, many young people today have no appreciation of the artistic appeal a really good black and white movie film can have. Home video versions of The 39 Steps as both DVD's and videotapes have been released by a number of different distributors and these vary in quality enormously. In general DVD's are capable of better rendering of these subtle shade differences than videotapes, but either can be satisfactory. The first requirement is that the distributor has used a high quality master for the material copied, not an old tape that has already been played numerous times. The next is that proper equipment designed for copying from black and white masters is used. Too often copies of old black and white films are made with equipment that is designed only for copying colour films. In such cases the nuances of the multitude of grey shades present in the master are likely to be totally lost. Many of the copies of Hitchcock's film still being sold are particularly bad in this respect, with highlight areas that are totally burnt out instead of containing a mass of detail. The best advice is to consult a website such as that of Amazon.com, where the various versions available are listed and priced, with user comments that indicate how satisfactory the final product has been found by the purchaser concerned. My advice is DO NOT LET YOURSELF BE HAD - THIS WILL ONLY ENCOURAGE THE MARKETING OF SUB-STANDARD MATERIAL.

But this was all before I saw the commentary. According to the commentary easy riders was the first movie that really showed the counter culture as it was - not the stereotypical pollyanna ideal American youth that older generations wanted to portray. Now I really understand the cultural significance of this movie and I am glad I saw it. I also have noted how the characters did not have any idea about the consequences of drug use. Some of those same stereotypes are still the same today as they are 35 years ago. This film showed a commune, the hippie wandering spirit, the marijuana and the mentality of wanting to reconnect with the earth. You can still see this mentality today in seniors who were strongly influenced by this form of thinking and when you visit an area like Woodstock, New York or Parts of the San Francisco Bay area and Northern California. In addition, it was good to see where some of the songs I STILL hear on classic radio stations first came out. The scenery was just breathtaking. I really have to give them credit for capturing all they did. The only part I did not appreciate was near the end when they were all on what appeared to be lsd and the scenes all made no sense. I got the point early on and just wished that it had been significantly shortened. I would highly recommend this to people over 18. It is without a doubt one of the best films to capture the consciousness of an era that influences the present.

A clever, character-driven courtroom drama, it deserved the Academy Award nominations that it received in 1958, and it has justly endured to the present day. Starring the terrific talents of Charles Laughton, Tyrone Power, and particularly Marlene Dietrich, directed by Billy Wilder, and based on the superb short story by Agatha Christie, it is a combination has all of the very best ingredients, and delivers a nearly outstanding film.The movie centers around Laughton's character, an aged, feisty, and very canny English barrister (lawyer) who is in poor health and headed toward retirement. The opening of the movie is entirely Laughton's show, as he portrays a curmudgeonly and endearing character. On his first day home from the hospital, he soon takes up the defense of Leonard Vole (Power) a man who is charged with murder and up against a barrage of circumstantial evidence. Power is convincing as the honest and somewhat naive defendant, in increasingly over his head. Soon, Dietrich makes her entrance as Vole's cool German femme fatal of a wife. After a few flashbacks to set up the story of the murder case, Laughton takes up Vole's case. What ensues is a well-written and well-directed courtroom drama, in which Laughton continues to shine, delivering a convincing performance peppered with humor. Soon, the story takes a series of dramatic twists, during which Power plays his part as the beleaguered defendant to the hilt and Dietrich uses the gifts that made her a legend. By the end, the audience has been treated to an excellent drama with sensational acting.The result is a classic, but not an icon in the sense that Christie's short story, penned twenty years earlier, would become. While it may be the best-regarded of all Christie adaptations (Murder on the Orient Express a possible exception), the movie does not seem to have the stature it ought to have. At the end of the movie, I did not feel the same as when I read the story, and not just because I knew all along how it would turn out. With such visible talent on all fronts, I took a long look at what it was, and what was missing. The answer Christie. The movie is good in its own right, but from the beginning misses the crucial aspect that the original story has the mystery. Agatha Christie is the master of suspense, and throughout the story, that suspense, that anxiousness to know what will happen next, the eagerness to know where this next twist will lead, and the shock that comes at the very end, were what the story was all about. The direction the movie went, the legal thriller, substituted drama for mystery, and while the movie only added to the story, changing very little of what Christie wrote, the movie lost the grip that only she could create. Christie treated the courtroom proceedings (the centerpiece of the movie) with brevity, focusing on the intrigue surrounding the case. Also, the Hollywood ending overdoes it a little bit, and deprives the most important plot twist of some of its its emotional impact.That said, however, the movie is still a classic. Fortunately, the heart of the story was still very strong, with a unique plot and rich characters, which were taken advantage of by Wilder and the cast, respectively. And, as it turns out, the movie is a good complement to the story. To those who have only seen the movie, the story should be read to truly appreciate the missing value of the mystery. To those who have read the story, the movie nails the characters (particularly Dietrich's Mrs. Vole). All in all, I give this movie a 9 out of 10, and would gladly see it again.

Go get it right now - you won't regret it.And, of course, there's Johnny Depp's acting. Leo DiCaprio couldn't have done it; Brad Pitt probably couldn't have either. Of course, the copious amounts of makeup help, but in general it's Edward that makes the movie.The atmospheres in 'Scissorhands' are liberally juggled with. First there's the foreboding, anti-fairytale into - then the Day-Glo shades of the neighbourhood and the in-betweens of Ed's living there. Back to the black at the end. Whew.Oh, yeah if you're emotional, you may want to watch this with your boyfriend\/hubby. And bring the Kleenexes. I don't cry easy, and I cried a few times. Be warned.8\/10. Worth a view; sure, most of it is pretty boring and trite, but the good parts make up for it.

That is love between Sam and Annie, the love between Sam and Joah. In the film, Sam¬°¬Øs and Annie¬°¬Øs love like a magic story, how amazing! Their relationship shown in the film were third times, but just the third times made them get together! Yes, this is true love not the but the spirit in the heart, little things and love are communicating in their deep heart. In my point, we should exchange our ideas to each other, do not put myself in the first place, put it into the other¬°¬Øs place to think things for the others, so the things will get the good end! In the most situations we consider the things for ourselves, in that case, we get the happy times, do not see other¬°¬Øs sadness, if we do that things, it means we are still a child, not an adult, because an adult might think things for someone. The same, when we are in love, we should do like this, if you do the things and think the things for your lover, that you do and think the things for yourself. We are not a child; we should think things for your parents, for your friends, for someone around you. Love is a million tiny things, you do for someone whom you loved and add up these things that is like coming home, so sweet, so warm. It is so hard and so important to make someone happy, make just one someone happy, make just one heart the heart you sing to, one smile that cheers you!! We grow up and become mature in love.

Due to the number of Soldier featured you don't get as involved with them as if there were 2 or 3 main characters, but being a true story every time a soldier dies it is a real man who really died 5000miles from home in some stinking city. many have commented on the lack of poetry in this film, this i personally find one of the films strongest attributes, it is a down and dirty film about what these men went through, there wasn't a lot poetic about it. Rather than trying to make any big political points, what this film delivers is the courage of these men. what really hammers home the point is the coffins in the back of the hercules as the film endsA fine tribute to the men who did not return, i feel everyone has a duty to see this film.
