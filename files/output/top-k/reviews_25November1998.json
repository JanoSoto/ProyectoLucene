She acted well in this movie, depicting a vulnerable Queen who doesn't (at first) fully realize the dangers of her position, but Christopher Eccleston and Geoffrey Rush impressed me the most.Eccleston is extremely versatile; he is like a creature unrelated to his Jude from a few years ago.  Geoffrey Rush was strong and enigmatic as Walsingham, Elizabeth's protector. I half wish the movie had been more about HIM.  I am not familiar with the actual history; did either of these men exist?  I would have liked to have seen more about them; I liked the glimpses we were given into their dealings with others.  Fascinating characters.In any case, these were the major stand out performances.  John Gielgud (as the Pope) was not memorable because he was on screen for no more than a few minutes and his lines were hardly quotable.  Eric Cantona as the French Ambassador had an amazing sort of presence; I remember him quite clearly ... and I had no idea he was a soccer player til I read it here on IMDb.  Also, the woman who played Elizabeth's first handmaiden (or whatever they are called) was very expressive and is worth mentioning.Joseph Fiennes' character was irritating beyond belief.  I consider myself to be a person of reasonable intelligence, but I could not figure out whose side he was on or why by the time the end credits appeared. The writers (or editors) really screwed up with this character; a lot of his behavior was not clarified.  I believed him when he told Elizabeth that he loved her, but then ... why was he having sex with one of her maids?  What did he have to do with the poison dress?  Why did he seem shocked to see her writhing in agony if he knew nothing of the poisoned dress?  Why would he want to see Elizabeth assassinated if he loved her?  He made no sense to me.  Not to mention I could not understand why she adored him so much; he struck me as being a fop.  Leonardo DiCaprio would have been just as suitable for this role (probably more so, since he's played the type before) ... this character was listless, lolling, lazy, and a priss.  It lowered Elizabeth to even be attracted to this man.  I found myself wondering, Where is that fiercely handsome Duke of Norfolk? every time Lord Roberts showed up on screen with his puppydog eyes.On the positive side, the film is quite lush and colorful.  Visually, it's stunning and deserves some sort of award for that.  But, as others have mentioned, the use of music was atrocious.  The music didn't always match the mood of the scene, and sometimes it would actually detract from the scene.I think this movie is supposed to be about how a woman sacrifices her own happiness and personal convictions for the good of her people and the stability of her position.  Nice attempt, but it doesn't quite pan out.  In the end, Elizabeth comes off as a freak of nature - how exactly does caking your face with white powder make you like the Virgin Mary?  That was never explained.In any case, the music in the final scene was so obnoxious that I couldn't even reflect on the poor Queen's hideous transformation.  I just wanted to cut out of the auditorium as quickly as possible.I think I'll be checking out that Elizabeth R series that everyone keeps talking about.

Mr. Wonderful is in heaven but decides he's gonna get his wife there too, because, dammit, he's just so Wonderful.  Conveniently, since most of the movie is in heaven, the screenwriter can make up whatever ad hoc rules he needs to to see to it that Mr. Wonderful is successful.

Robin Williams fans will be disappointed and his trend of playing heroic figures of ever more increasing Terrificness (Dead Poets Society, Cadillac Man, Awakenings, Good Will Hunting and now this) is starting to get a bit disturbing.

It seemed that his character was intended to be some sort of 'all knowing' advisor and he is sustained in this way throughout the film.The build-up and release of suspense to and during the first detection of the signal is excellent and I was preparing myself for a very thought provoking movie to continue the almost flawless beginning.  Unfortunately at this point I was somewhat disappointed.  Suddenly a character (Hadden) is introduced who seems like he's been plucked straight out of a James Bond movie.

A friend recommended this film to me, and I am a big fan of Anthony Hopkins...I'm even willing to admit that I sorta like Brad Pitt, though I'm not female. But whoa...even granted my admitted skepticism and dislike of this particular genre, I found very little to like about Meet Joe Black. Direction missing. Editing did the editor just take a long lunch break? There's no need for this movie to be 3 hours long. Take out the long lingering shots of Brad Pitt alone and the film would lose an hour. Music ouch. Sappy, too much, too loud, far too manipulative. But the basic problem with the film is Brad Pitt. He's just awful. No direction, no focus, no development, no goals.Maybe I'm missing the attraction of watching a guy like Pitt fumble around embarrassingly and pretend like he's experiencing everything for the first time; as I said, I'm not a woman. But for me, Brad Pitt was absolute dead weight in this film, which makes for a bit of a sticky situation as he's one of the leads. The writing, on the other hand, was even worse. Hackneyed, trite, generic, cliched, tired; at times frankly insulting. Hopkins managed to save much of the script from itself (at least his bits), but these guys (Osborn and Reno) have little or no grasp of decent dialogue. Claire Forlani is certainly beautiful, but her facial expressions became tiresome fast, bordering on gimmicky before the film was half over (why CAN'T she make eye contact even once in awhile? She was like the lead singer of the Bangles). Hopkins is marvelous, however; he truly is one of the finest performers of this or any other generation. I would rank this among the most workmanlike performances from him I've seen; given the atrocious script he had to work with. For me the bright spot of the film (outside of the pure joy of watching Anthony Hopkins perform) was Marcia Gay Harden and Jeffrey Tambor. They were terrific. Harden's desperate need for her father's love and attention; Tambor's bumbling naivety and love for his wife; and Hopkins' endearing, dignified love for his daughters (Hopkins truly is, as Harden says, a wonderful father) are the things I'll take away from this film, almost in and of themselves enough to save the film for me.

His great films (Seven Samurai, Dersu Uzala, Rashamon) are the finest films in the history of film making. However, this film does not rank with them.Kagemusha tells a true story set near the end of Japan's feudal period (around 1580). The story is that a clan leader (Shingin) was such a superior general that even though his clan was outnumbered, they could not be defeated while he lived. Knowing this, his close advisors concealed his death for three years, placing a shadow warrior or double in his place. However, the situation did not last and when the ruse was discovered, the clan's army was destroyed in battle.Problems with the film most importantly, the main character (the double) fails to express himself. The actor, in my opinion, fails to convey any worthwhile qualities, either by word or deed, such that we should care about his situation. I personally think Toshiro Mifune would have been a huge addition to the film. The combination of poor dialog and poor acting removes the very heart from the film. He was weak when he should have been strong, he was silent when he should have spoken.Another huge problem with the film was the editing. There are many pointless scenes of military units marching up hills and down, this way and that. Visually the marching men have some flair, but it is totally meaningless and lacks any dramatic value. The comparison to Seven Samurai is harsh and unfavorable to Kagemusha. In the earlier film, each action made perfect sense, there was not a wasted shot in the whole movie. In Kagemusha, by contrast, at least 15 minutes of marching soldiers serves no purpose.Perhaps Kurosawa was trying to tell a deeper story, about how life is random, how you are thrown into situations for which you are not trained and there is no good way out.

What at first can be interpreted as a mere feature length supernatural conspiracy thriller (sort of like a grown up X Files), eventually evolves into an afterlife allegory of astonishing scope and power. The hints are subtle and obscure The woman Jacob lives with for much of the film may seem harmless, but her name, Jezebel, is laden with connotations, as are quotes like 'you sold your soul, remember' and her open hostility towards Jacob's son, through whom salvation lies. What is never in doubt is the central spiritual role played throughout by Danny Aiello (did anyone ever tell you you look like an angel Louis?) or the vivid reality of the truly terrifying demons that appear round every corner.Bearing in mind this translation of the movie,it has long since confused me what role the whole paranoid 'hallucinogenics in Vietnam' plot serves. I think perhaps it simply makes the whole experience a great deal more coherent and accessible to those who can't be bothered to watch for biblical references. There is of course one more suggestion, which is that the entire plot is rooted in Dante's Inferno, which I'm not even going to pretend to have read! So why is this my favourite movie?

But now, when it's being released all over the world, I will feel glad if I can induce people to see it when reading this comment, cause, until now, the film is vivid on my mind and in my heart because of the greatness of its scenes and also because of the care and the tenderness it borrows to the common ones, the ones who gets hardened by nowadays troubles.The first scene, when there are some illiterate poor people inside central station in Rio de Janeiro asking Dora to write the letters they cannot write, is overwhelming. The one when Dora pays attention to her femininity and decides to put on a new dress and some lipstick is very great too. And there are so many others before the unforgettable final...Aligned with Saving Private Ryan, The Truman Show, Jackie Brown, Carne Tremula, Karakter, and some others this is one of the best films released here this year. Please, see it and choose your own favorite scenes. ","genre":"Drama"}]
