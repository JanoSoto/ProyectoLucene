It's amazing that this was one of the first movie scores by composer Clint Mansell -- and even more amazing that although the film received a slew of nominations and awards, the composer was only nominated once.

We all know the story as Dracula lures Harker (Bruno Ganz) to his castle and soon sets his eyes on his fianc√© Lucy (Isabelle Adjani). By 1979 the tale of Dracula had been told at least a few hundred times too many and considering the type of movies Herzog was making, one would wonder why he's want to deliver us another version of the familiar story but it's a good thing he did because this here is without question one of the most beautiful, haunting and downright unique horror films ever made. I believe this latest viewing was my third and it's rather remarkable at how wonderful and creepy this film is and how even though we know every inch of the story it's still like we're seeing it for the first time. The film is very slow, there's no question about it but the slowness here isn't a negative thing but it's just one part of the terrific atmosphere built up by Herzog. This is such a strange film to experience because the slowness is also surrounding by a certain cold nature and a cold look that makes the film come to life. The life of the film is centered around the fact that everything looks and feels dead. I think the pure genius of Herzog is painting a world where we really get to feel what it's like to be Dracula. The world is a cold one, an ugly one and a rather lonely one. I think the film's greatest aspect is that Herzog builds up this atmosphere so perfect that even though we've seen this story told hundreds of times, this here seems the most fresh and original. Two other important factors in this is the cinematography by Jorg Schmidt-Reitwein and the haunting music score by Popol Vuh. Both of these aspects add in heavily on the atmosphere and the damp look of the film is something that will make you want to pause the movie and just soak it in. Another important factor in all of this are the performances, which are all quite strange yet so realistic that you can't help but feel as if you're witnessing these characters for the first time. Ganz makes for a perfect Harker and Adjani has the perfect feel and tone for Lucy. Both Roland Toper as Renfield and Walter Ladengast as Van Helsing are perfect but so are various actors in smaller parts. Then, of course, there's Kinski who is simply chilling in the role. He has very little to say but Kinski is brilliant at getting Dracula's emotions to come through without words. Just take a look at Kinski working in the scene where Harker is eating and take a look at Kinski's eyes as he simply stands there watching him eat. Another great example is when Dracula first encounters Lucy. The way Kinski plays all of this is pitch-perfect. From the haunting opening shots of the mummies up until the chilling end, Herzog paints a true and ugly portrait that is remarkable and something so original that it's hard to believe the effort was made to begin with and it's even more remarkable that it came off so well. There are so many haunting shots here with one of my favorites not being linked to any horror sequence. It happens on Harker's walk to Dracula's castle when he's walking along the river and about to go into the cave. The view of this as well as the waterfall are just chilling. People often asks how many times much a familiar story or familiar subject matter be remade and it's quite clear that if you have the talent then you can do something truly original no matter how many times it was tried before your work. This is a very unique film and certainly one of the greatest of its kind.

This movie will be most entertaining for those who like to watch extended scenes of police surveillance - in other words, people who like to watch people watching people will love this. Probably 75% of this movie revolves around police surveillance or various chases. That's not particularly a criticism - just know that it's a primary focus of the movie when you go in; it's not the now typical action-adventure type of movie. The surveillance is portrayed rather well, and it does lead to a gradual but deliberate buildup of the story, which revolves around a major shipment of drugs coming into New York City from France, and the efforts of a couple of NYPD detectives to stop it.Gene Hackman won an Oscar as Best Lead Actor for his portrayal of Det. Popeye Doyle - and he was deserving. He was first-rate as a totally obsessed cop who's out to get the bad guys at whatever cost. His obsession probably reaches its climax (as does the movie as a whole in many ways) with the wild car chase scene, as Popeye commandeers a civilian's car to chase a train carrying a sniper who had tried to kill him. It's obvious in that chase that Popeye has no regard for his own safety - or for anyone else's on the road, so obsessed is he with catching this guy. That chase scene was exciting. The movie as a whole isn't particularly exciting, although it does provide a fascinating look at the methods of both the drug smugglers and the cops trying to stop them.The movie is based on real events and real people, although all the names have been changed. My biggest criticism of the movie is the last scene. This seemed to be building up to a truly climactic resolution; instead, I found the ending to be a classic example of anti-climax, as it just seems to come to an end at a point that didn't make much sense as the ending, with the viewer suddenly being told in script what happened to all the main characters (which was a bit misleading, since the characters in this movie were only based on actual people.)

His second Oscar for Forrest Gump came in a film that received more than double that in nominations and awards. If Forrest Gump did nothing else it solidified Hanks's credentials as a serious actor. He would never be doing imitations of his Bosom Buddies character in films again.It also among other awards also won for Best Picture and Best director for Robert Zemeckis, richly deserved. The film is Huckleberry Finn like in its canny observations coming from the man who had an IQ we are told of 75. But as Forrest also tells us, stupid is as stupid does. And Forrest with the hand of an unseen providence comes out a lot better than some of the clever people he meets in life.Watching the film once again it occurred to me that Mark Twain if he couldn't have written this himself would have loved the way Zemeckis handled the character of Forrest Gump. The beauty of Huckleberry Finn and the secret of its success is that Twain got into the mind of a child who recorded all the events around him, a child without too much education. What Zemeckis did was get Hanks into a child like mind who sees things with amazing clarity stripped of any veneer of pretense. Which Hanks observes in the people around him and in the events that shape America and himself from Eisenhower to Reagan.There are two prominent female parts in Forrest Gump. One is for Robin Wright who plays the abused child Julie as an adult. She is Forrest's love and best friend and she takes a different path of life one she chose with more deliberation than Hanks. Their fates though eventually entwined are radically different. The second major female role is for another two time Oscar winner Sally Field who now is playing matronly parts, a far cry from Gidget and the Flying Nun. She gives Forrest the maxims he lives by and in a crisis they turn out to be more than sound bite clich√©s.Another award that Forrest Gump won is for Special Effects and an award it didn't win was for Gary Sinise in the role of Lieutenant Dan Taylor, Forrest's commanding officer in Vietnam. That's something that does not compute because the special effects were to show Gary Sinise as a double amputee with both legs lost in Vietnam.It's some amazing bit of work no doubt about it, but to honor it without Sinise whose performance really brings it off is ridiculous. Sinise is the educated one who curses the fate that happened to him, but in the end by just going with the flow he does prosper in the end. Sinise lost that year in Best Supporting Actor category to Martin Landau for Ed Wood, but I think Sinise's performance has had a more lasting impact.To those Americans who serve our country it certainly has. Gary Sinise has devoted a great deal of his life and earned treasure to bring entertainment to our overseas troops in Iraq, Afghanistan, wherever, becoming a successor to Bob Hope in that regard. He's gone further than that though, setting up foundations to help civilians in both countries and contributing to numerous charities dealing with war and its aftermath. Doing that in my humble opinion Gary Sinise has become one of the great Americans of our brand new millenia, a lot more than just an actor. He's forever now known as Lieutenant Dan.In the end though the film belongs to Tom Hanks who joined with Spencer Tracy as the only two male actors to win back to back Oscars for Best Actor. Hanks fascinates us and guides us through this film and when we're done we've seen something very special.If you don't believe me about how good Forrest Gump is, then watch it for a few minutes and see if you're not sucked in.

The second major female role is for another two time Oscar winner Sally Field who now is playing matronly parts, a far cry from Gidget and the Flying Nun. She gives Forrest the maxims he lives by and in a crisis they turn out to be more than sound bite clich√©s.Another award that Forrest Gump won is for Special Effects and an award it didn't win was for Gary Sinise in the role of Lieutenant Dan Taylor, Forrest's commanding officer in Vietnam. That's something that does not compute because the special effects were to show Gary Sinise as a double amputee with both legs lost in Vietnam.It's some amazing bit of work no doubt about it, but to honor it without Sinise whose performance really brings it off is ridiculous. Sinise is the educated one who curses the fate that happened to him, but in the end by just going with the flow he does prosper in the end. Sinise lost that year in Best Supporting Actor category to Martin Landau for Ed Wood, but I think Sinise's performance has had a more lasting impact.To those Americans who serve our country it certainly has. Gary Sinise has devoted a great deal of his life and earned treasure to bring entertainment to our overseas troops in Iraq, Afghanistan, wherever, becoming a successor to Bob Hope in that regard. He's gone further than that though, setting up foundations to help civilians in both countries and contributing to numerous charities dealing with war and its aftermath. Doing that in my humble opinion Gary Sinise has become one of the great Americans of our brand new millenia, a lot more than just an actor. He's forever now known as Lieutenant Dan.In the end though the film belongs to Tom Hanks who joined with Spencer Tracy as the only two male actors to win back to back Oscars for Best Actor. Hanks fascinates us and guides us through this film and when we're done we've seen something very special.If you don't believe me about how good Forrest Gump is, then watch it for a few minutes and see if you're not sucked in. Like Forrest's mama says, the film's like life which is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you'll get until you open it.

Now it isn't like I have anything against her--I just am not particularly a mystery fan--so keep this in mind when you read the review. Perhaps it's because of this that I found the plot so incredibly contrived. Think about it--there is a boat traveling down the Nile and a woman is murdered...and practically everyone on board hated this lady and would loved to have killed her! This isn't like Murder on the Orient Express where a huge group of people who hated a man deliberately conspired to ALL be there to murder someone. We are expected, instead, to believe that it was all just a coincidence that almost all the passengers EXCEPT Poirot hated this particular woman! This strains credibility WAAAY past the breaking point and even Charlie Chan never faced coincidences like this! Plus, while different, it's enough like Murder on the Orient Express to make you wonder why this plot was explored. I know that many Agatha Christie fans out there cannot accept that I am not 100% in awe of her story, but this isn't meant as just an insult--she was a great author--but the plot does have problems. And the problems, unfortunately, don't stop there. At one point, Angela Lansbury is about to tell everyone who the killer is--and is conveniently shot in the head at that exact moment! Doesn't this seem rather...once again...contrived? It's all a shame, actually, as the plot did NOT need to have so many people on board who wanted to kill her--the actual murder and how it was constructed was really interesting. Plus, the final scene with the murderers was fantastic!Despite these problems, though, the film is quite entertaining. The multi-star cast is very good and I liked Peter Ustinov as Poirot as he looked less like a wax dummy than how Albert Finney (though Murder on the Orient Express was still a better film). Likewise, it was nice to see old favorites like Bette Davis, David Niven, George Kennedy and Maggie Smith. My only reservation about the cast was the odd decision to cast Jack Warden as a German doctor!! Why didn't they pick someone who was German or at least could be more convincing in this role?

After various production issues including two director's being fired, the film ended up pretty much being 100% on its own with the only connection to the earlier film being Kinski. In the film, vampire hunter Paris Catalano (Christopher Plummer) travels to Venice, the last known location of the vampire Nosferatu (Kinski). Catalano tries to locate the whereabouts of the vampire who he believes has a desire to finally die. This is a rather interesting failure that has a lot going for it but it's obvious the production issues caused a lot of problems especially during the first part of the movie. The film starts off very ambitious as it centers on the Plummer character in current times but we then have several flashbacks to the earlier days of Nosferatu and how he became who he is. This was an interesting idea but it never really works for several reasons and one of them is a bizarre rock score that doesn't fit anything we see. Another reason these flashbacks never work is because at times it's hard to follow what exactly is going on and why certain flashbacks might be happening. Then, around the fifty-minute mark, something strange happens and the film actually turns extremely entertaining as Nosferatu finds himself in current times and falling in love with a young black lady who might just hold the key to his eventual death. Yes, Kinski drove several directors away from the film and this is partly to blame of the uneven film but you also have to give him credit because he turns in a great performance. He has his long blonde hair flowing and there's no chalk make-up so we get to see this Nosferatu in a very human-like state and the actor makes us feel sorry for this person who simply won't die. I found Kinski really intense throughout the film and this certainly spills over for several entertaining scenes but I think the romantic side works the best. Plummer is also pretty good in his rather thankless role and we even get Donald Pleasence in a role but he's pretty much wasted. Barbara De Rossi and Anne Knecht are both good as the ladies in the pack. Augusto Caminito, Mario Caiano, Luigi Cozzi and Maurizio Lucidi all did some work on the film but it was Caminito who ended up shooting the majority of the film. Even Kinski was apparently in charge of directing his scenes so who knows what was really going on with this production. It's certainly a very troubled movie but at the same time there's just so much here that does work in the end. We get some rather strong atmosphere and being 1988 and from Italy, there's much more sex, nudity and blood than normal, which is a plus. I doubt art house fans are going to enjoy this thing but if you're a horror fan and like Kinski then it would be worth your time to check this out. It's certainly not going to replace the Herzog film but it's an interesting little movie.

And all the way through these labors, Turner fumes with indignation (except when she's screaming) and Douglas is making wisecracks, some of which carry with them the slight taste of Angst. At the end, they both die tragic deaths and the thugs get the emerald and walk away sneering. Just kidding.Douglas is pretty good as the imitation Indiana Jones, although he is by no means an Arnold Schwarzenegger, who would simply have wrenched off the head of anyone who stood in his way. He's not Burt Lancaster either. Lancaster would have done a back flip and disappeared when cornered. Kathleen Turner is properly breathless and wide-eyed. Danny DeVito contributes some laughs. In a police station, with his Wanted poster on the wall next to him, he's forced to make a phone call to his gangster cousin and tries to disguise himself and the purpose of his call. Hello, Ma? It's me, Irving. . . Calm down, Ma. . . . Who SAYS I never call? I don't know why but for some reason that line always cracks me up.It's funny because it's so desperately unbelievable. The head honcho, the capo, of the thugs catches the monstrous emerald in his hand. A crocodile snaps his jaws up and chomps off the hood's hand. Mind you, this is even worse than slitting your wrists. But the hood manages to let out only some kind of horrible MOAN, then wraps his bloody stump in a handkerchief and carries on, cranky, as if with a hangnail.Probably the equal, or nearly so, of Raiders of the Lost Ark, without the moral message or the sublime artistry of the original.

Some modern offerings include Mr Destiny, Maid to Order, and the TV shows The Flying Nun and Touched by an Angel. None of these kinds of films have much in the way of cutting social commentary or even ground-breaking cinematic techniques. However, their entertainment value is very high, being nothing but. Heaven Can Wait is this kind of a movie, maybe the perfect chick flick as it combines fantasy, football and even a little love story.The story is relatively simple Joe Pendleton (Warren Beatty), a quarterback in the twilight of his career, feels destined to make it to the Superbowl. The LA Rams, his team, are in the playoffs. One day during early-morning training after consuming his liver-and-whey shake, he bicycles into a tunnel where two large vehicles taking both lanes are charging from the other direction of the tunnel.

The next thing he knows, he's jogging among clouds with an escort (played by writer-director Buck Henry who also played the hotel attendant in The Graduate) in a suit and tie trying to get him to stop running around. Pendleton is still in his athletic clothes sporting a soprano saxophone and doing push-ups among the fluffy billows. He doesn't quite realize he's died. Or has he? Turns out the escort made a mistake Pendleton would have survived, perhaps avoided, the collision, but the escort nabbed him from his body before the resolution of the event, relying on probability and outcome, a recurring theme of the movie. Pendleton was not due for many decades.His case is taken up by Mr Jordan (James Mason in one of his later roles) a kind of heavenly supervisor who apparently coordinates peoples' souls. Realizing the mistake, Jordan takes Pendleton back to earth to find him a new body so he can live out the rest of his life as he was meant to. The only one available is the body of millionaire Leo Farnsworth who has just been murdered care of his estranged wife and personal assistant, played brilliantly by Dyan Cannon and Charles Grodin.

Pendleton, now as stuffy gazillionaire Farnsworth, must forge a way to get back to the Rams in time for the Superbowl.The aspect that saves this film from falling too far into sentimental gush or absolute unbelievability is the quality of the acting of the leads (particularly Warren Beatty, Charles Grodin, Dyan Cannon, Julie Christie, James Mason, and Jack Warden as Max, the Rams' trainer) coupled with a fine screenplay. Everything is believable. Certainly the whole concept is just about as far-fetched as the Land of Oz, but you never contemplate that possibility for a moment.

The film's elaborate plot, the double-crossing and double-double-crossing also impressed me at the time. I then saw Miller's Crossing and remember also being impressed. Next came Raising Arizona which did rather less for me (and I don't very much like Nicolas Cage). After that, in no particular order were The Hudsucker Proxy, Barton Fink and Fargo. I admired Fargo - the Coen's are nothing if not stylish - but I didn't like the way the William Macy character, a schmuck in trouble who gets in way out of his depth, was the butt of the jokes. It was like getting easy laughs from teasing the fat kid in class and as, for a while, I thought of myself as 'the fat kid' - I wasn't half as fat as I thought, but I wasn't very slim, either - I didn't like it. I saw a couple more Coen brothers movies after that, for example The Big Lebowski and, more recently No Country For Old Men, but I found I had unwittingly joined the small club of those who aren't quite as impressed with Ethan and Joel Coen as so obviously Ethan and Joel are. Why not? I think it might be because, as one critic I read said of Fargo, they are heartless. There is cleverness galore in their films but each film lacks something essential to a great film. For my money the Coens are good at making good-looking films but those films are never as good as they might be. They seem more an exercise in Ethan and Joel demonstrating what smart kids they are than anything else. A year or two ago, I saw Blood Money again and it wasn't quite as good as I had remembered it. Miller's Crossing is rather the same yes, you keep watching because - well, these lads make technically good films. But once the credits roll, you find you don't give a hoot. Miller's Crossing has another Coen-manufactured intricate plot, but it is all rather pointless.

The credits song-track is a track entitled 'HalfLight' performed by Tomandandy. And, Acredited with some of those lyrics is none other than the films demagogic character Indrid Cold. So, that should tell you about intent regarding this movies production.Those comments notwithstanding, it is about the slickest of its genre ever.To be honest, I rented this movie thinking that it was actually a different film entirely. Its quite something to rent a film with Richard Gere in it, thinking it is actually the film where 'the guy at the end turns into a giant moth!' Most of the way through I was waiting for that - but indeed - I was misinformed regarding another movie, so I had probably a few more amps than most regarding this film.It is cinematically perfect IMO.I won't go on - save to say that , , I want to point out that this movie would have been in pre-production in around the year 2000. Significant insofar that its release was in 2002, 1 year after sept 11 and shortly before Afganistan and Iraq. It does seem to have been - unaffected in a production sense - but this will not in any way deter the message of this movie...It is not-all-that x-files IMO, not once did I think of the X-files as I was watching it.And, it is the best performance of Gere to date, the most underrated actor in cinematic history, along with the most underrated actor ever - Will Paton. Paton's performance here is text book method, but without the heavy haul... Script ...from the SINK! worth noting Patton was also in 4th Contact - so y'see where this guy actually makes movies happen.So, get it out.
