[{"date":"8 June 2014","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Wolf von Frankenstein (Basil Rathbone), the son of Henry Frankenstein from the first two films, has returned to Europe from America to inherit his father's castle. He brings along his wife and young son. They are greeted coldly by the local villagers, who are suspicious of anyone bearing the Frankenstein name. Their suspicions are soon justified when Frankenstein meets Ygor (Bela Lugosi), a graverobber who has a deformed neck due to a botched hanging. Ygor takes Wolf to the comatose body of the monster (Boris Karloff) his father created and the son decides to follow in his father's footsteps by reviving the creature.The third film in Universal's Frankenstein series and the first without James Whale. It's a terrific movie that adds a lot to the Frankenstein mythos, particularly Ygor. It doesn't get as much respect as the first two Frankenstein films but it really should. It's just as creative and influential. The plots of the Frankenstein sequels that followed would owe more to this film than its predecessors. It would also be the primary source for the Mel Brooks parody movie Young Frankenstein. Rowland V. Lee's direction is impressive and he more than proves himself worthy to follow in the footsteps of Whale. The music by Frank Skinner is wonderful. I love the Expressionistic sets. The cast is one of the finest Universal ever assembled. Horror legends Bela Lugosi and Lionel Atwill both have roles here that are career highlights. Lugosi's Ygor is often touted as his best acting performance, something that is very hard to argue against. Atwill's wooden-armed Inspector Krogh is undeniably memorable and might be his finest role as well. For his part, Basil Rathbone plays the part of Wolf brilliantly but he doesn't get much respect from critics, who call him hammy. To me, he's never over the top or distracting in his performance. If he's hammy, it's with a precision that many actors could learn from. This was Boris Karloff's final turn as the monster in the Frankenstein series. While he's given less to work with than the last film, he still manages to create a sympathetic and human monster. The subsequent actors taking on the role would pretty much play the monster as a mindless, hulking creature with little personality. When it comes to actors portraying Frankenstein's monster, there's Boris Karloff and then there's everybody else far down the list. The only oddity in the cast is Donnie Dunagan, the little boy playing Frankenstein's son. He was from the (American) South so he has this noticeable accent that stands out, as well as being a pretty poor little actor. He flubs several lines. Still, for avid fans like myself there's a certain charm to his quirky casting. Perhaps it's because so many of the Universal horrors took place in a blended 19th\/20th century fictional world with actors of various nationalities all playing countrymen.Son of Frankenstein serves as a perfect finish to the series. Yes, there are more sequels but those films, while very entertaining, are not on the level of the original three masterpieces. The trilogy of Frankenstein, Bride, and Son are among the finest, most creative films Universal put out, regardless of genre. There is genuine artistry on display in these three films. While the first two get an appropriate amount of respect and praise, I can't help but feel this one gets the short end of the stick. It's really a fantastic movie and one of my favorites of the entire Universal horror catalogue.

Much like the excellent 'Jabberwocky' movie by Terry Gilliam this movie has also been somewhat herded into the Monty Python film collection as a kind of extension to the Python universe. The same could also be said for the movies 'Yellowbeard' and 'Timebandits', unfortunately neither 'Erik' or 'Yellowbeard' are any good really and both fall flat, although this is better than the Chapman vehicle.Inspired by Jones's own children's story book but strangely enough not following his own creation, the film revolves around Norse mythology although I'm unsure how closely, I doubt its that close. We follow Erik and his viking crew as they travel to Asgard so they may ask the Gods to end the age of Ragnarök. They all believe the sun has been swallowed by Fenrir the mighty wolf which has plunged their world into darkness. So its a travelling into the unknown type adventure which was very popular in the 80's.I guess the main issue I had with this film (first time seeing it!) was the fact it felt like it was trying to copy various other movies in terms of visuals at least. The whole mystery voyage into the unknown and looking for mystical fabled items angle is cool but so very dated and to be really truly honest this film just felt like a combination of all of the films I mentioned above. The visuals aren't even that exciting really, most of the start is set within a drab dreary Viking village, then we move onto a drab and dreary sea sequence, then we get some exotic visuals but eventually its back to drab and dreary as they find Asgard. Most of the movie looks very cheap and cheerful too, the sea monster is quite nice and typically Python-esque but all sets and costumes (especially wigs) just look very tacky.I realise Jones has gone for that simple dirty cheap look (classic Python look) but it comes across as a tired attempt. 'Time bandits' had the same kind of visual approach but it also had some good location sequences and an exciting story, this story of Erik didn't really grab me at all. I didn't feel anything for any of the characters, their journey seems too easy, they find their goal quite quickly without doing much, the Gods are just kids which was anti-climatic, nothing really happens during the adventure that is of any real consequence...no urges of pending failure and the finale is really very weak.I can't even say any of the characters were good fun...the same old routines which have been seen before in better films. There is a strong element of forced comedy throughout the film which is never really that amusing. The silly goofy characters are just trying way too hard, a good example would be the entire sequence set on Hy-Brasil with Jones in a familiar high pitched speaking role. As for Robbins as Erik...he is miscast in my view, far too meek, not really good looking enough for the hero and with an American accent!...sheesh! what on earth was Jones thinking?! Not even the powerhouse that is John Cleese can help this dull tale, his portrayal of the evil 'Halfdan the Black' as a soft spoken good mannered pleasant seeming chap (basically Cleese playing Cleese or his Robin Hood character from 'Timebandits'), again just felt rehashed and out of place. There are one or two nice visual moments like the Viking ship going over the edge of the flat Earth and as I said the sea monster (what you see of it), but that's about it. I found the whole thing rather underwhelming frankly despite the solid UK cast and alluringly cool little movie poster. Its pretty unexciting with little to care about and a terrible finale, there are better Python-esque fantasies out there.3.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"8 June 2014","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Now this is a film long since lost in the annals of time.
