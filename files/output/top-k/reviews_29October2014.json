[{"date":"29 October 2014","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Tim Burton re-imagines Planet of the Apes. To put it simply, I enjoyed watching it. The original Apes films are masterpieces of cinema to be sure. So Burton decided that instead of merely retelling the original story, he would put his own spin to the tale. As such, it should be appreciated as a film in its own right and not a mere rehash. The cast, namely Mark Wahlberg, Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Clarke Duncan, etc., gave pretty impressive performances. One of my favorite bits has to be Charlton Heston's cameo. In ape makeup, no less. I will not spoil the ending here. it has to be seen to be believed, but I can assure you, you won't forget it. Highly recommended.
