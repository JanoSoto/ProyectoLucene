Obviously, the content isn't the reason for it.. as it is terrifying, but that's what makes it so beautiful. It was directed, acted, edited perfectly. I have major respect for those involved in the making of this film. A lot of people may say this film is over-hyped, but I honestly don't see it.

I had heard about this movie before Houston's death, but I still didn't really want to see it. I really wasn't interested at all. When she died, there was a lot of talk about her movie with Kevin Costner, and his eulogy was very moving to me. He spoke a lot about the movie, and around the time of her death, people kept talking about it and how good it was. So I added it to my Netflix queue, still not really expecting much, and I got just what I was expecting. The movie seemed very lazy to me, put together and didn't really come off as a movie of a specific genre. This movie is for people who want to hear Whitney Houston's voice, which is quite an amazing singing voice. I have nothing against Whitney, I just didn't like the movie. She was an amazing talent, but I just didn't like the movie very much.The first five minutes of the movie had me interested, I won't lie. The story of the movie goes something like this a former Secret Service agent is hired by a pop singer to be her bodyguard, after a murder attempt. Once he arrives to meet her, he realizes how much security she is lacking. She is a very famous pop singer, and yet she is living in the most vulnerable way. When he meets the pop singer, Rachel Marron, that's where things started to get a little eh for me. I knew it was Houston's first movie debut, but I just couldn't buy it. As much as I tried, I really couldn't see Houston as an actress. I see her as a singer, and that's what she should've stayed as. To me, she was very unconvincing as Rachel Marron, even though she was practically playing herself. She just wasn't good at acting through this whole movie, and I just didn't like it for that. But there's more reasons to why I didn't like this movie. I couldn't stand the way this movie bounced across genres. What was this supposed to be? There are different genres that can be combined, like an action-comedy. Two genres in one, that's usually the limit in which a movie can stay good. But this movie had way too many genres, and it was hard to keep up with. Is it a romance? Is it an action movie? Is it a thriller? Is it a comedy? Drama? Music? It goes on and on, and Mick Jackson just tried to jam-pack all of these into a movie that was two hours long, and that was just painful for me to watch. They could've made the changes make sense at least, and have them move from one to the other in a smooth way. These genres were put together in a five minute scene, where it starts with Houston singing, an ominous person, a shootout, then a romance scene between Costner and Houston. I couldn't stand it, it was too sloppy for me.I would avoid this movie, but I know a bunch of people like it. But I'm a cinema fan, and I see movies for their value. A lot of people liked it, for they saw it as a romance movie. But I see it as a movie that's overloaded. 3\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"30 May 2012","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" It's taken me a while to see this movie, and now that I have, I really just didn't like it.

Can't say End of Days have a tons of it but i got more into the story, maybe because its fictional.This one tend to go on a more realistic side yet including very unrealistic parts(Fireman goes to Colombia to find the terrorist that killed his family). The action isn't non-stop, even tough its Arny alone vs the world once again. Its more like of a suspense with some action parts. Anyway its really hard to explain, i guess as a movie by itself its not bad, but as an Arny movie you would expect more. I saw tough that he was 50 something filming this, he dosen't look like it.

It's a classic social drama, one of those dour black-and-white movies where men in suits talk about Serious Issues, and that can be very off-putting to a modern audience. But at the same time there's a lot of interesting, subversive stuff going on below the surface.For starters, there's the format. 12 Angry Men is what's known in television as a bubble episode -- it takes place almost entirely within one room, with the only action being dialogue between the characters. And this totally works. The movie never becomes dull, even for a member of my attention-span-deprived generation. Moreover, our isolation as viewers mirrors the jury's own isolation. The only facts we know are the ones we overhear, which puts us in the same position as these men. Of course, all this could fall apart without good acting, but the mostly (at least now) unknown cast pulls through and does an admirable job.What's most striking about the film is the uncertainty it leaves us in. Unlike in TV lawyer shows, there's never a smoking gun that says that the client is innocent or someone else did it. All that 12 Angry Men introduces is doubt our eyes, our ears, the testimony of others, all can deceive us, so determining the truth becomes an impossible. The film reveals the absurdity of the American justice system, which puts so much stock in not just frail human perception but also the biases and pettiness of ordinary people. In the end the accused goes free not because he is innocent (that remains undetermined) but because Henry Fonda's character is very persuasive, and another guy wants to get out early to go to the ball game.Of course, you could also read this as an affirmation of the justice system. The jury is presented with a stack of convincing evidence, but through argument, is eventually able to come to the right conclusion. That's what makes this film so interesting it's ambiguous to the point of paradox, being simultaneously a range of opposite things.

It's so cool to just look at.Beside from visuals, the music\/lyrics I believe are incredible. This is Halloween is so fun with clowns who can tear away their face and monsters hiding under your bed while remaining not frightening for children. Jack's Lament is such a wonderful song with a touching message we all know too well getting tired of the same old thing.

I finally managed to force myself to finish it, and it wasn't too bad.Ten years ago, four friends (Wendy, Kelly, Jude, and Nick) unintentionally made a girl their age fall to her death. Now, they're seniors and it's the day of the prom. All four have dates, and even Nick is going with Kim, the sister of the girl that died ten years prior. But on prom, someone begins killing them off one by one. Is it the principal, who was the father of the murdered girl ten years prior? Is it the brother of that girl? Is it the man who was convicted of the crime, but has escaped from a mental institution recently? Or is it the creepy gardener? PROM NIGHT really is an endurance test for slasher fans. The first fifty odd minutes consist of nothing but character-building, which mostly amounts to just talking about who's dating who and other crap. Granted, there are some entertaining characters and some of the character-building does succeed in creating likable characters, but it is still difficult to make it through that length of time unscathed.However, fifty minutes in, the prom begins. And that's when the fun begins. Flashing, colored lights, disco music, Leslie Nielson, and disco dancing. Nielson was in the film before the prom, but still. There's about a three-minute long period where Curtis's character (Kim) disco dances with her boyfriend. It's wonderful. There are some kills, but they're not that bloody. There is some great suspense, especially in the chase scene with Wendy. The film's most memorable moment, however, is when the ski-mask clad killer decapitates one poor teen (who he thinks is Nick), and his head rolls out onto the catwalk! I still stand by my theory that PROM NIGHT is only famous because of Ms. Curtis, but it's still a fun watch if you have the patience to wait for the last forty minutes or so. Gotta love that Prom Night disco song, though.

I could watch this movie 1000 times (and I think I may have) and still belly laugh all the way through! I've let my kids watch it and all of the 'adult' jokes go right over their heads, like they did mine when I was only 13 (that's how I remember when this movie was released). Blake Edwards, who was not only Julie Andrew's husband but also the director of all the Pink Panther movies, was a brilliant director that more young movie makers should model their craft after. Physical comedy, not necessarily script lines, will always get a huge laugh if filmed properly with proper comedic timing (something that is next-to-impossible to teach). Knowing HOW to shoot a comedy scene is the key to getting those big laughs (watch the cockroach- restaurant scene to the end and note the change in audience perspective; that's what makes that scene a cinematic classic!) Get some popcorn, a glass of good French wine and prepare yourself for an evening of laughs and feel-good entertainment! Great for the whole family...as long as you're not uptight. Life's too short to go through it uptight anyway so LEARN to be less selfish, LEARN to respect other people's way of thinking (even if it differs from your own beliefs)and LEARN how to be TOLERANT!

I loved this work of art, and no review can take that away from me. When a new patient is brought to a mental institution claiming to be an inhabitant of a planet called K-PAX, the hospital seems just the place for him. Yet, except for certain otherworldly abilities, the alien, he, appears to be perfectly sane. In taped therapy sessions he is asked about life on K-PAX - its lifestyle, principles, foods, language. He paints a consistent and credible portrait of a glorious utopia painfully unlike our own and yet so possible, could we only erase from human nature its greed and cruelty. It becomes easy, even desirable, to believe in his identity and homeland. But he insists that he must return home. As his announced date of departure approaches, staff and patients alike are thrown into turmoil If he is mad, what will happen when the fateful day arrives? If K-PAX is for real...please, may they come along too?

Scott gave the weight of the film to special effects supervisors Richard Yuricich, who had already proved his worth on Star Wars and Douglas Trumbull, who had set the groundwork for special effects with his early work on 2001 and then later on Close Encounters. Trumbull loved to use miniatures while Yuricich's approach was to use opticals and traveling mattes.

Of course, it helps to have perpetual darkness and constant rain to mask any deficiencies. Still, we can suspend our disbelief and take in this once possible vision of a world now just seven years away.

While it would be nice to have a flying car, the idea that the sky is filled with flying objects that could crash into one another over a school yard or a hospital or a city park is even more frightening than a robot that walks, talks, and looks human.

The cost of even one such creature would be astronomical compared to the cost benefits derived.

I was completely gripped the whole way through. As well as a great plot the films other standout feature is its score which is performed on the slide guitar by Ry Cooper. It is haunting and repetitive but in a good way. It worked very well with the plot and the on screen visuals which were also exemplary.

This is one of the few perfect examples showing that Adam Sandler can effectively make a drama film, with some mild comedy, and create a relatively passable picture, but he opts out for cruder, more one-dimensional projects that provide little wit. This among 50 First Dates, Click, and Funny People can be viewed as the delightfully surprising Sandler pictures. The rest you can feel free to discard.I'm too amazed at how tolerable some of the pictures where Sandler is out of the frame are. By now, most are aware of the Happy Madison regulars; Sandler, Rob Schneider, David Spade, Allen Covert, Peter Dante, Kevin Nealon, and newcomers Kevin James and Nick Swardson. I found Happy Madison's Dickie Roberts Former Child Star and Grandma's Boy to be entertaining works, if marginally forgettable, but also observed how when Sandler is working as producer, the end result is more often than not better. We'll see if that formula continues to thrive. I have quite a few more Happy Madison pictures to dig through.Here, Sandler is actually rather capable playing the doughy man-child Sonny, who is 32, works one day a week at a toll-booth, and somehow still managed to snag the beautiful girlfriend. He manages to remain in stable conditions living off restitution payments from a petty vehicle accident. While Sonny's recently engaged roommate Kevin, played by, yes that, Jon Stewart, is off on business in China, Sonny is greeted with a five year old named Julian (the Sprouse twins) on his doorstep, and a written note claims that Julian came from a night of partying on Kevin's part. Unable to return home, Kevin puts Sonny under the care of Julian, and Sonny winds up lying to Social Services saying he is Kevin.So, when Sandler's character is the parent, what do you think will happen? Insubordination? Mischief? Rambunctiousness and chaos galore? Well, you're right, but all in a muted form. What Sonny winds up doing with the kid is rather tame and not expected from the usual Sandler schtick. There's even a hint of nice sentimentality, that comes in the form of pleasantness rather than conventional schmaltz. He allows the kid to utilize options rather than orders to hopefully round him out to be a better person, rather than evolve into a miserable degenerate late on in life. Ultimately, the focus is more on the slapstick and the crudeness of the picture, and we go from some marginally sentimental scenes to jokes about Sonny's relationship with his gay friends (Covert and Dante) very quickly. But even then, the film never truly becomes dismal or reprehensible.There's even a love story, with the beautiful Joey Lauren Adams playing Layla, Kevin's fiancée's sister. She keeps the story from truly going too far into the sea of despair, and is even involved in some of the film's best scenes. The one I immediately think of is the bedtime story.What ultimately stops Big Daddy dead in its tracks is formula, which truly isn't taken in a way sharp enough to wholeheartedly recommend. Its mixture of slapstick and charm is impressive, the performances are nice, and the delivery is rarely rocky, but at times, the film becomes a tad too contrived, incorporating textbook pieces like the inevitable courtroom scene at the end and the cute kid says naughty thing cliché. For Sandler, it's a step up, and he may want to consider more of the impressively sassy kids films with a nice heart.Starring Adam Sandler, Cole Sprouse, Dylan Sprouse, Joey Lauren Adams, Jon Stewart, Rob Schneider, Leslie Mann, and Steve Buscemi.

The rest you can feel free to discard.I'm too amazed at how tolerable some of the pictures where Sandler is out of the frame are. By now, most are aware of the Happy Madison regulars; Sandler, Rob Schneider, David Spade, Allen Covert, Peter Dante, Kevin Nealon, and newcomers Kevin James and Nick Swardson. I found Happy Madison's Dickie Roberts Former Child Star and Grandma's Boy to be entertaining works, if marginally forgettable, but also observed how when Sandler is working as producer, the end result is more often than not better. We'll see if that formula continues to thrive. I have quite a few more Happy Madison pictures to dig through.Here, Sandler is actually rather capable playing the doughy man-child Sonny, who is 32, works one day a week at a toll-booth, and somehow still managed to snag the beautiful girlfriend. He manages to remain in stable conditions living off restitution payments from a petty vehicle accident. While Sonny's recently engaged roommate Kevin, played by, yes that, Jon Stewart, is off on business in China, Sonny is greeted with a five year old named Julian (the Sprouse twins) on his doorstep, and a written note claims that Julian came from a night of partying on Kevin's part. Unable to return home, Kevin puts Sonny under the care of Julian, and Sonny winds up lying to Social Services saying he is Kevin.So, when Sandler's character is the parent, what do you think will happen? Insubordination? Mischief? Rambunctiousness and chaos galore? Well, you're right, but all in a muted form. What Sonny winds up doing with the kid is rather tame and not expected from the usual Sandler schtick. There's even a hint of nice sentimentality, that comes in the form of pleasantness rather than conventional schmaltz. He allows the kid to utilize options rather than orders to hopefully round him out to be a better person, rather than evolve into a miserable degenerate late on in life. Ultimately, the focus is more on the slapstick and the crudeness of the picture, and we go from some marginally sentimental scenes to jokes about Sonny's relationship with his gay friends (Covert and Dante) very quickly. But even then, the film never truly becomes dismal or reprehensible.There's even a love story, with the beautiful Joey Lauren Adams playing Layla, Kevin's fiancée's sister. She keeps the story from truly going too far into the sea of despair, and is even involved in some of the film's best scenes. The one I immediately think of is the bedtime story.What ultimately stops Big Daddy dead in its tracks is formula, which truly isn't taken in a way sharp enough to wholeheartedly recommend. Its mixture of slapstick and charm is impressive, the performances are nice, and the delivery is rarely rocky, but at times, the film becomes a tad too contrived, incorporating textbook pieces like the inevitable courtroom scene at the end and the cute kid says naughty thing cliché. For Sandler, it's a step up, and he may want to consider more of the impressively sassy kids films with a nice heart.Starring Adam Sandler, Cole Sprouse, Dylan Sprouse, Joey Lauren Adams, Jon Stewart, Rob Schneider, Leslie Mann, and Steve Buscemi.

It's a winner throughout its long runtime of 2.5 hours; it never bores, not even in the Director's Cut version in which previously cut 20 or so minutes are restored. It's a vehicle for the director, writer and main star of _Sling Blade_, Billy Bob Thornton -- and clearly he invested his life's most intense creative effort into this movie (expanded from an earlier short movie of 25 minutes), and all the effort paid off hugely.The acting is uniformly superb, starting with the ingenious creation of the leading character of Karl Childers; the distinctive speech, behaviour, and movement patters of this character are something that's likely to make you smile ever so often even after you get perfectly used to seeing them. It's like the boy says to Karl, I like the way you talk, and Karl replies I like the way *you* talk. Indeed, this reverse is true as well; never has dialectal speech been captured on film more charmingly than Thornton's native Arkansas dialect in _Sling Blade_, so true to life it may sometimes be difficult, even for native English speakers, to understand what is being said, but you won't mind.Hardly anyone can pull off the trick of showing a grown man embracing a boy and saying, I love you, with the boy replying, I love you too, without this involving sexual connotations; but Thornton accomplishes the feat here; the relationship and friendship is portrayed as purely Platonic, that is non-sexual (as opposed to the original Greek concept).A huge accomplishment of _Sling Blade_ is on how many levels it is engaging it's an engrossing, serious, and essentially brutal drama, but in many moments, it's also wonderful comedy; the dramatic and the comedic are often intertwined within the same scene.There's a delightful cameo by another genius film-maker, Jim Jarmusch, as the seller of French fried potatoes, at the beginning of the movie; there's definitely a spiritual connection, if you will, between _Sling Blade_ and Jarmusch's work; _Sling Blade_ might well be a Jarmusch movie for all you know, and anyone who loves Jim Jarmusch movies will feel right at home in _Sling Blade_. (Speaking of cameos, let's also give credit to Robert Duvall for the few minutes he can be seen here!) Another astonishing achievement of _Sling Blade_ is that even though you have a pretty good idea about how the movie is going to end -- you don't really mind; it's suspenseful throughout.Watching the movie is likely to make you feel desperate, maddeningly helpless; or you might even become a misanthrope; because you realize that it is only through pure accident or lucky (?) chance that Karl was able to rescue (by questionable means) the mother & boy from the abusive live-in boyfriend (fabulously played by Dwight Yoakam larger than life here, and more menacing than the repeat killer!). But how many abused families, wives, mothers, or children, are there around the world right now, and have been for centuries, and will be for many more centuries to come, yet with no Karl to come to *their* rescue? After you realize this, it really makes you despair of the human race. Especially after you realize that the suffering is at least partly self-inflicted the mother brought the abuser's affections onto herself willingly, feeling unable to cope with her life situation on her own after her husband commits suicide due to lacking finances to support his family.That is another stinging aspect of _Sling Blade_ portraying the ridiculous materialistic divides between people, even those in their early teens; see the scene where the girl disdainfully speaks of the bouquet of flowers lovingly presented to her as coming from a dollar store and therefore being of inferior quality.Other cast members are great, too, particularly Lucas Black in the boy's role, and John Ritter as the overly sensitive -- or is it cowardly? -- but movingly humane dollar-store owner.Fantastic score by David Lanois, especially in the disjointed rock guitar riffs just prior to the murder scene; it's as if the music was mirroring the lead character's unclear state of mind, his decision-making process.It's fascinating that although we observe Karl Childers for 2.5 hours, he's not really a clear-cut, easily labelled person; we struggle, in classifying him, similarly to Vaughan when, in a funny episode, he believes Karl must have been thinking hard, philosophically, about something, although he was only thinking about food right then. And so, even though Karl is clearly mentally handicapped, in other ways he's a genius, representing a character surrounded by a world intrinsically foreign to him (it's too big, he says at the end); the world at large is different from Karl -- and so anyone who feels estranged in their life situation, can sympathize with Karl; their fate is like that of Karl. And doesn't this apply to all geniuses, or in a sense to all artists? This was incisively captured by Vaughan when he remarked that being gay in this small town is like being handicapped; but the same might be said of people whose intelligence much exceeds that of their surroundings they will feel similarly estranged.Yet the world in _Sling Blade_ isn't depicted as black-and-white; funnily enough, the only colour eschewed is red (because Thornton dislikes it); otherwise, _Sling Blade_ shows the world and human beings as they are, in their complex entirety and self-contradicting facets both beautiful (gorgeous backdrops of rural Arkansas!) and at the same time hideous; both cruel and stupid, and simultaneously compassionate and kind (see the warden and his family, or the Bill Cox character who cannot reconcile his Christian conscience with keeping Karl locked away for the night, handing him the keys on day 2).
