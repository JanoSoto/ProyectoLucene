It's amazing that a film that's basically just an excuse for showing hot women and to please everyone, Patrick Swayze without his shirt, as much as possible.I will not go into the plot because I think just about everyone knows it's ridiculous. Just state that I was surprised how much graphic violence it has. I must have been drunk the first time I saw it, because the fight scenes went straight to the garbage bin of my mind at the time.Anyway, what is so attractive about this is the film's inane dialogue. There is actually a character who says I used to bleep guys like you in prison to try and intimidate Swayze's character, Dalton. It's amazing that Swayze could finish that scene with a straight face. The bloopers must be a riot to watch.There is one more reason why I like this film and that is Jeff Healey. I think this is the only time he ever tried acting and he does a really good job. His southern accent is believable even though he is from Canada and the songs are a nice mix of covers, past songs from the band and of course best of all The Doors cover. One little fault Jeff Healey normally only played lead guitar in rare instances, but here (because the songs are playback), he is able to both play the rhythm and lead guitar at the same time. I saw him live where he had the ugliest lead guitar player in history and it's a shame that they didn't include somebody to play him because I think he didn't use the same guy in all his concerts. Anyway, it was nice to see his two other regular band members get some shots in the movie.The score by Michael Kamen is pretty good, but it sounds an awful lot like the score from Lethal Weapon which has been pointed out by Oliver Harper on Retrospective Reviews.There are however major flaws with the flick that I simply can't overlook. Kelly Lynch is given the most ridiculous character to play and one of her lines comparing Dalton's character to that of the bad guy made me almost faint in disbelief. The bad guy Wesley is nicely played by Ben Gazzara by the way. I am not a huge fan of his and in many of his roles he goes overboard with his method training (the worst performance was his Al Capone), but fortunately he is very low key and has a nice moment where we see that he does have a conscience buried deep inside the character.I will not mention the director because this is definitely a Joel Silver production if ever there was one. I don't know why he feels that he has to show women who are humiliating themselves and don't get me wrong. I don't object to naked women on screen but there is one character who taunts Dalton and it's the most excruciatingly bad scene to sit through. That scene alone is why I give the film such a low rating.The ending is very cheesy. Wesley has such a stranglehold on the town that the citizens don't stand up to him. What do they do to make up for that. I won't reveal it but it is one of the more unbelievable parts of the movie, but then the whole thing ain't exactly a documentary to begin with.

Having watched several Sci-fi films that were made after this, it was easy to see where they drew their inspiration from. 2001 did for Sci-Fi what Orwell's 1984 did for the 'Dystopian Future' idea. The exposition in this film is immense; going all the way back to the dawn of man was a bold way to give the audience the set up. I really liked the stark contrast of ape killing ape in a barren desert to space travel. Needless to say, the way Kubrick shot this film is nothing short of astounding. The genius camera angles and the frankly dizzying, gravity defying one-shot takes helped to create a level of immersion I seldom find in films. The soundtrack is also fantastic. Mixing majestic Classical pieces and dark, ethereal choral singing helped build up a foreboding atmosphere that drew me right in from the moment the Monolith first appears on screen. Having said that, the one thing I feel lets it down is the pacing. I have no problem with a film that takes a while to get into gear. I love films that build up a world around the viewer and fully immerses me in the story. That's exactly what I look for in a film. But with 2001 A Space Odyssey, there were some scenes that really did drag on. I felt like some shots just really didn't need to be as long as they were. And a lot of the screen time was spent on things that didn't contribute to dialogue, plot, character development or immersion. These shots were simply there so Kubrick could bask in his own genius a little longer. Those scenes just killed it for me as I found my eyes wandering and my concentration waning. Otherwise, it's a film way ahead of it's time and the forerunner to countless Sci-Fi films and for that, it really is great.

If you want to watch Superman fly around like an emo teenager for two hours struggling with great power and great responsibility, this is not your film. If you want to watch a man shunned by society because they are different, or struggle with a secret identity, again this is not your film. If you want to watch a quintessential American hero flying around with a big S on his chest saving people and lifting heavy things while he tries to juggle a romance with Lois Lane (and by God, who doesn't? this is your movie.This film is straddling a line between Adam West Batman silliness and fish out of water family fare handled with the innovative special effects and story gravitas that was then a part of summer blockbusters. Superman is able to take its story seriously without ever losing sight of the absurdity of the premise and its function as entertainment.So what, it doesn't take the subject matter seriously? Hell yes it does. We have the Godfather himself Marlon Brando, playing Superman's Kryptonian father in dead serious mode, explaining to Superman who he is, where his power comes from, and that he has been sent to earth because of our capacity for good. We also have Gene Hackman as an over the top and enjoyably malevolent Lex Luthor with a plan that is absolutely bonkers. But the best thing about this movie is Reeve's portrayal of Superman\/ Clark Kent. He plays the absurd happenings completely straight, He remains the best flesh and bones version of Superman from TV or film. No one else has encapsulated the character as well or totally as Reeve, which contributed sadly to this under rated actor never really emerging from the character's shadow.Superman takes Lois Lane on a joy flight, improvs himself into a train track, shifts the Earth's tectonic plates and reverses time before the movie's over.This is the type of Superman film the world wanted in 1978. Earnest, light and lacking even the vaguest hint of cynicism. Sadly it's also the type of Superman movie the world will never see again. We've become jaded, entitled and cynical. We're no longer interested in a character who is all powerful and pure. We want ambiguity and weakness in our heroes, and I don't personally believe this version of Superman has a home in our universe in 2015, and the world is poorer for it.But it's well worth returning to this piece of cinematic magic that showed us a pure, powerful alien faster than a speeding bullet, leaping tall buildings in a single bound and fighting for truth and justice in the American way. RIP Christopher Reeve there was never another Superman like you.

We also have Gene Hackman as an over the top and enjoyably malevolent Lex Luthor with a plan that is absolutely bonkers. But the best thing about this movie is Reeve's portrayal of Superman\/ Clark Kent. He plays the absurd happenings completely straight, He remains the best flesh and bones version of Superman from TV or film. No one else has encapsulated the character as well or totally as Reeve, which contributed sadly to this under rated actor never really emerging from the character's shadow.Superman takes Lois Lane on a joy flight, improvs himself into a train track, shifts the Earth's tectonic plates and reverses time before the movie's over.This is the type of Superman film the world wanted in 1978. Earnest, light and lacking even the vaguest hint of cynicism. Sadly it's also the type of Superman movie the world will never see again. We've become jaded, entitled and cynical. We're no longer interested in a character who is all powerful and pure. We want ambiguity and weakness in our heroes, and I don't personally believe this version of Superman has a home in our universe in 2015, and the world is poorer for it.But it's well worth returning to this piece of cinematic magic that showed us a pure, powerful alien faster than a speeding bullet, leaping tall buildings in a single bound and fighting for truth and justice in the American way.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama"},{"date":"9 July 2015","score":"","review":" This film came out in 1978, 3 years before I entered the world, and yet was as much a part of my child hood as Star Wars and ET. This is a film that aspires to be what movies are all about creating an image and a product that has the viewer staring at the screen in awe for two hours, and it largely succeeds.The key to the success of this film, despite it's obviously fake (by today's standard) flying effects and slow pace, is the way the film chooses to portray Superman. If you want to watch Superman fly around like an emo teenager for two hours struggling with great power and great responsibility, this is not your film. If you want to watch a man shunned by society because they are different, or struggle with a secret identity, again this is not your film. If you want to watch a quintessential American hero flying around with a big S on his chest saving people and lifting heavy things while he tries to juggle a romance with Lois Lane (and by God, who doesn't? this is your movie.This film is straddling a line between Adam West Batman silliness and fish out of water family fare handled with the innovative special effects and story gravitas that was then a part of summer blockbusters. Superman is able to take its story seriously without ever losing sight of the absurdity of the premise and its function as entertainment.So what, it doesn't take the subject matter seriously? Hell yes it does. We have the Godfather himself Marlon Brando, playing Superman's Kryptonian father in dead serious mode, explaining to Superman who he is, where his power comes from, and that he has been sent to earth because of our capacity for good.

Gone were the years of trusting the government, of listening to cultural norms; too cynical were the times. After decades of oppressive societal expectations, housewives no longer had to imitate Lucy Ricardo, the kiddos didn't have to reek of Cherry Cokes and wholesomeness, and the husbands suddenly didn't have to only bring home the bacon; they had to think about their feelings, too. Some thrived, some stumbled &#x97; putting out one's most kept secret emotions onto a table for everyone to see isn't an easy thing to do, after all. So you had your Bob and Carol and Ted and Alices, swinging away and having fun (for the most part), but you also had your bourgeoisie trying on the clothes of the open-minded and not knowing what the hell to do with them.The Ice Storm is a flurry of sexual, drugged out, pathos infused liberties, perfectly capturing the simultaneously free and miserable echoes of its time period. None of the characters are happy, so much so that it seems fairly plausible that they miss the suffocation of the time in which they could mimic Leave It to Beaver and be contently empty. Ang Lee, pre-Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and post-Sense and Sensibility, directs The Ice Storm not as a head-shaking cynic but as a voyeur helpless when approached by the lost decisions of Rick Moody's characters.Taking place over the Thanksgiving weekend of 1973, The Ice Storm puts in motion a parade of maladjusted actions, specifically focusing on the Hood family and their neighbors, the Carvers. Mrs. Hood (Joan Allen) has picked up a shoplifting habit and is hardly speaking to her husband; Mr. Hood, in the meantime, is having a soulless affair with Mrs. Carver (Sigourney Weaver). And as Mr. Carver (Jamey Sheridan) busies himself with out-of-town business ventures, the kids of the families mostly hang around his home. Wendy Hood (Christina Ricci), a sexually curious 14-year-old, is in the process of attempting to seduce both Carver sons (Elijah Wood, Adam Hann-Byrd), either through make out sessions or show-me-yours-I'll-show-you-mine romps. The older Hood child, Paul (Tobey Maguire), is away at prep school, experimenting with drugs and attempting to win the heart of the damaged Libbets Casey (Katie Holmes). All of these characters are like trains ready to derail, and as an upcoming ice storm looms in the clouds, ready to destroy the premises, their emotions begin to mount until they reach an existential breaking point. The Ice Storm is not the kind of film you analyze, the kind you have all figured out before the closing tells you otherwise. This is a movie you want to observe, to listen to, to discuss later but savor in the moment. The plot is complicated, sure to tangle &#x97; but it effortlessly connects the dots like a well-guided Altman epic, brilliant in its conception and brilliant in how well each side-plot complements the other. It's a movie of heightened discontent, one in which the characters attempt to escape by utilizing their newfound freedoms (sex, alcohol, drugs) but realize that, deep inside, a larger void is waiting to be filled and material things can hardly do the job. The film causes an ache in our heart, partly because it's difficult to see people suffer so intensely and partly because we are just as much in the dark regarding how to end their misery as they are. They feel helpless, we feel helpless &#x97; it's a vicious cycle that stays unforgettable.The performances are phenomenal, the actors embodying their roles instead of keeping a safe distance away from them. The Ice Storm is a movie built on emotion and life-is- comedy situations, not worn out melodramatic devices &#x97; Lee, certainly one of the most versatile directors of the last two decades, keeps melancholy pumping and solution at a safe distance; in Tinsel Town, it's easy to invent a resolution for the sake of a happy ending.

Originally director Tim Burton was set to direct this movie, but due to his work with Batman Returns, stop motion director Henry Selick took over as director while Burton remained producer. I'll be honest, this movie gets more pumped for Halloween than Christmas, it has great atmosphere for both seasons but it may have something to do with the sets for Halloween town and Danny Elfman's Oscar worthy score that have that dark and Gothic feel to it. What I like about this movie is how the plot pays some homage to classic Christmas tales, I mean Jack Skellington being Santa was definitely inspired by the Grinch. The story is about the king of Halloween, Jack Skellington who has grown weary of doing the same thing every year until he comes across a strange place in the woods with trees that represent every other holiday and thus he discovers Christmas. Intrigued, he wants to bring this holiday to his town, however he doesn't quite understand the meaning of Christmas and his ambition and ignorance causes it to backfire. Jack might be the scariest hero ever,why? He's a skeleton, sure he's a nice guy but if he can make you scream like a banshee and jump out of your skin, I'd run. As I said he's ambitious a little ignorant and nice guy, but he's also intimidating for a hero, but hey Halloween, right? Jack's voice is provided by composer Danny Elfman (singing) and Chris Humperdinck Sarandon (speaking). Elfman gets a little more credit because I'm pretty sure he has more singing lines as opposed to speaking, both actors are perfect for the part in my opinion. Originally they asked Sarandon if he'd sing but he didn't believe he could and thus Elfman got the singing role. Jack also has the love interest, Sally voiced by Catherine O'Hara. Sally is the smartest character in the movie, from drugging her master, making a potion, jumping out a window and stitching herself up, and seeing a vision of Jack's Christmas. She feels empty because she really has nothing but being trapped and part of the emptiness relates her to Jack because he's depressed and weary. Jack decides to take Christmas and has Oogie Boogie's henchmen kidnap Santa and unknown to Jack they take him to Boogie. Eventually Jack goes out into the night to deliver Halloween made toys to kids for Christmas and it goes wrong and the military takes action and shoots him down and he accepts that he is the pumpkin king and goes to rescue Santa and Sally from Boogie and give Christmas back to Santa as he goes to fix Jack's mistakes. Jack returns to Halloween Town as Santa fly's by and wishes them a happy Halloween, Jack realizes how much Sally cared to fix everything and thus they fall in love at the end. I still think the movie holds up really well, the stop motion is phenomenal, the voice acting is great, the songs are amazing, the score is Oscar worthy, the characters are good and a lot are famous Halloween monsters. The romance felt a little shallow I admit, at first I felt Sally fell for Jack because he's just awesome, but it does establish a little connection. I still see this as a Halloween movie and it's atmosphere and score get pumped to dress up and scare people. I also see this as the best stop motion animated feature ever made, I love this movie and whether it gets you excited for Halloween or Christmas I think you'll find enjoyment in this move.

Or maybe that's why I like it... The movie plays like a comedy, but has some serious attitude at the same time. It feels right to laugh amidst all the imagery of greed, ego and corporate America. Plus, carpenter busts up clichés in really cool ways, I mean, the ending is like a satisfying slap in face. I did find it a little cheap, though, when our lead man 'nada' makes these quantum leaps in character. Sure, I love to laugh at that kind of excrement, but it doesn't mean it's good. The story and concept are so strong that just a little more attention to character might have gone a long way.

A film that quite literally saved Walt Disney Animation Studios and allowed them to continue shaping our childhoods.It's also the first fairytale film Disney had produced in a long time, featuring only the second Disney princess at the time of its release. A film of many returns and a film that helped to solidify what a Disney film was to mean.And it's a fantastic film in its own right. The animation is once again some of the best ever made, which must have been a true treat for the audiences at the time after a full half of a decade of nothing but shorts of varying quality. Here the quality is topnotch, though we still have a few films to go before Disney would once again start to push the medium forward with Sleeping Beauty.The story is of course a classic, and nowadays the version almost all think of when they hear the name Cinderella. Disney has always been at its best when it's doing adaptations, this being no exception. The best parts of the original fairytale are transformed into the silver screen experience we've all come to love.If I had to name one problem, I have to admit that the mice are a bit annoying now that I'm an adult.

There are not weak spots like Summer Rental or The Great Outdoors. It is good all the way through. The short length of the movie works very well. It flows well with no boring parts. The movie is his best because of the moral depth to the character. The jokes all come at his expense what a bumbler he is and how out of his element he is trying to be responsible for the first time in his whole life. The film was criticized for his sinister tone towards Bug when he is preying on Tia. The violence and threats of violence were a target of Siskel and Ebert. Well, when some guy is going around preying upon angry, upset teenage girls using them, getting them pregnant then dumping them, I did not find Buck's protective reaction wrong in any way. The parents are such a disaster; clueless yuppies obsessed with improving their lifestyle and abandoning the poor kids. This really is the core of the film that gives it such depth. Tia is ignored by the snobby, clueless mother seeking the affection she is denied at home. Buck is thrown into the middle of this dysfunctional family with a very angry, bitter teenage girl.Candy's self deprecating humor is at its best here. His protection of the children is well done without being gooey. The scene where he almost takes them to the race track and looks in the rear view mirror at them after cursing them; that is really a great distillation of why the film is his best. Candy made a lot of bad movies Harry Crumb, Delirious, Wagons East, they tended to be very superficial and often boring. This is a glaring exception. The protection of Tia, her coming to realize that he is not controlling her but protecting her; the last scene is the image that stays with you forever. After the yuppie parents go back in the house, Tia sees him truly for the first time. Their eyes meet and he raises his hand. She understands that despite his awkwardness, mistakes and being in general, kind of a bum, he truly loves her. The scene is the quintessence of the movie. The connection and the love, real love that sacrifices and protects not today's vapid verbiage devoid of any real actions of love.

An old antique dealer, Jesús Gris (Federico Luppi), has found an ancient alchemical device that promises to give life eternal to anyone that uses its power and provides the proper sacrifices. Unfortunately other parties are also looking for the device and thus Gris has to deal with the side effects of his newly found immortality as well as trying to keep himself and his relatives safe.Classic imagery, but del Toro's take on these old myths and ideas is refreshing and done well.

Sure, in some ways it may not be as great (can you ever beat the first installment?) but its inclusion of sequel rules and the introduction of the Stab franchise? Quite clever.We also get a dramatic increase in star names, which is really saying something with the list of big names in the first.

","genre":"Action, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"9 July 2015","score":"","review":" Paul Schrader's Blue Collar paints a depressing picture of the American blue collar worker - one Karl Marx would've simply shook his head at and scoff at in disgust. It shows a group of relatable individuals, all of whom slumming their lives away at a dead end, blue collar job, knowing all too well that they're expendable employees, when one particular member of the labor union is so unsatisfied with the lack of productivity on part of his union bosses that he challenges the incumbent to run for union boss. He believes that, if elected, he'd work for the people rather than having the people voice demands that ostensibly appear to fall on deaf ears. It isn't until he inches closer and closer to this potential gig that he realizes just what he's up against, the hoops he'll have to jump through, and the soul of his he'll have to sell in order as a price that comes with that kind of title.The optimistic soul is Zeke Brown (Richard Pryor), who works alongside his two best friends Jerry Bartowski (Harvey Keitel) and Smokey James (Yaphet Kotto). A great deal of Zeke's motivation to run for union boss comes when a tax collector comes to his house to collect unpaid taxes. In a bout of rage and frustration I'm sure many of us have felt, Zeke rants at the blameless tax collector by saying he barely makes enough money to buy food for his home, let alone keep the electricity running. He follows up by asking why he can't get a break when the same tax collectors give countless breaks to those on Wall Street. Zeke's rant is one of the defining scenes of this film, for it tackles a problem that, even over thirty years following this film's release, is a constant, every-day problem and insurmountable battle for a great deal of families.Zeke, Jerry, and Smokey decide to find a way to rob the union headquarters. However, upon executing their plan, they discover the union boss doesn't lie when he says that the union is low on cash, for they find very little money. The trio then stumble upon a ledger that contains information about illegal loans that reveal mob connections. Now the men know what it's like to be plunged into a world of crime and uncertainty, with their lives at risk and their optimism for their careers turned into a bitter, backstabbing game of survival of the fittest in a capitalist nightmare.There's a sadness that lurks in many American crime dramas and that sadness usually stems from the fact that something that should benefit people, or, at the very least, give them something to believe in, doesn't actually operate the way people think it does. Martin Scorsese's Casino showed us the brutal interworkings of a Las Vegas casino that was rigged to make the consumer lose at all cost, and make the soul pay a hefty price had they tried to beat the odds, and a movie like Oldboy shows the real ugliness of people in a crowded, tight-knit area that would lead you to believe people would be brought together or at least unified on a collective term. Blue Collar, however, cuts deeper. These are blue collar jobs we're looking at with this film; not clean-cut white collar jobs and not a rare case of fraud or backhanded dealings in one company. These kinds of manipulating tactics used amongst big business are an unfortunately common practice and Schrader exposes it in a startling manner.Schrader uses his exposure by getting Richard Pryor the leading role in a film that only manages to be funny when Pryor's character shows off his brazen attitude, which is very infrequent. Here, Pryor goes from the easily recognizable funny-man many of us know him as to a frighteningly hungry character, be it hungry for truth, or eventually, hungry for manipulation and winning. He commands the screen, even when assisted by the likes of Kotto and Keitel. This is his film through and through, a film where his formerly basic color palette of an actors transcends any kind of pre-conceived notions or judgment and shine bright and really show audiences his capabilities as a well-rounded character actor.Blue Collar is an ugly film, thematically and in terms of the situations its characters are forced into. It shows personal economic freedom and progress as a neverending cycle that results in nothing but further inequality and disenfranchisement from a country that allegedly fights against it. If a film like this came out in present time it would be a strong social statement, but its 1978 release date shows that little has changed in present time when it comes to the dealings of big business.Starring Richard Pryor, Harvey Keitel, and Yaphet Kotto.
