[{"date":"18 February 2010","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Jamal, the black kid, under performs at school (though not at taking tests) and makes a point of showing an interest in basketball to maintain his standing with his friends. Not to seem too academic you see, basketball being an acceptable activity to them.Back in the heady days of 2000 the prevailing theory to explain relatively poor black educational performance was still Fear of Acting White (do a search). Jamal is a means to illustrate this theory, carefully hiding his intellectual and academic prowess from scrutiny from his peers.These days the Fear of Acting White theory has fallen out of fashion. Now hip educationalists and sociologists have a new theory. Stereotype Threat (do another search) - this puts the blame for relatively poor black educational performance on black students buying into negative stereotypes. They are expected to do badly - so they do.I'm not sure a movie has been made yet utilising the Stereotype Threat concept, it might be a bit more difficult to portray perhaps, lets keep watching.Not to worry about that though, as the movie shows, when you get down to it, narrow minded white folks are to blame either way, either for creating an academic stereotype that black kids fear to emulate or for creating negative stereotypes that hold them back.Some may have noticed the problem - what is the predictive power of these theories - given that they largely contradict each other. In fact therein lies some of their power, since neither stands up to much inspection both are still in circulation happily contradicting each other. Back to the movie - Sean Connery plays the no-nonsense tough guy author. That role appeals to liberal types, fancying that they would act in the same way in the same situation. With the same conviction that somewhere buried inside those seemingly threatening black youths on the street are bookish, nerdy, white kids struggling to get out. And those black kids would understand their white mentors tough approach is in no way racist, just telling it like it is.Bonus marks here for interracial love interest and cynical elite\/white dominated school exploiting black kid for his basketball prowess.
