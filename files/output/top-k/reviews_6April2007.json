After all, this IS a Robert Zemeckis film. It does violate one of my rules because I truly like Tom Hanks. I've been a fan ever since I first saw him as Kip in Busom Buddies back in '79. I think he's terrible whenever he's a serious actor like in Forrest Gump or Philadelphia, so he's much better here with the hope of an Oscar as far off as a pending rescue. Anyway, not as bad as I had thought but way too long. The official running time is 143 minutes and could have easily been trimmed by 20 minutes. The rescue scene proves that when this director wants to just cut to the chase, he's more than capable of doing so. It's probably the best scene in the film as it comes very unexpectedly and is terrifically shot. You only see that Hanks sees the ship and they just cut right from there to him on a (what else) FedEx plane. They could have dragged things out here with a ton of over dramatics but they didn't. The ending was decent. Of course he delivered the unopened package, but I'm glad we didn't find out what was in it. Revealing that was a no win situation. If it was something completely mundane it would have been another unneeded scene. And if was a cell phone, well that would have been too contrived. The one contrived thing people dredge up is the whole FedEx Product Placement framework. Zemeckis claims that FedEx didn't pay a nickel for it, and I believe him. If I were FedEx, I wouldn't have put money into any film that had one of my jets going down, but I'd cooperate with it for free. I'm sure that the Hollywood types TRIED to extort $$$ from FedEx, but settled for their help instead. If I were a director, I definitely would rather use a real corporation in a film like this than a made up one. How many times have you seen a movie with a made up corporation and it becomes almost distracting because you just KNOW who it's supposed to be anyway? Well I guess that every movie deserves at least one viewing and I'm not sorry I spent the (including commercials) three hours watching this one. I love movies and you have to expect the bad with the good with the mediocre. The most amazing thing about a major Hollywood movie like this is the amount of people in the credits!

Basie doesn't really care as much about Jim as he does about survival and in the end has no qualms about deserting him and his best pal, Joe Pantoliano, without a word or, as far as we can tell, a second thought. When the atomic bomb demolishes two cities, the Japanese leave the camp. Jim wanders around a bit more before his parents finally locate him and take him away.Now kids, before you get lost, this is World War II we're talking about here. The USA got into it in 1941 and it ended in 1945. Shanghai was on the coast of China and it was a very cosmopolitan city, and it's becoming one again. The Japanese fought on one side and the US, Britain, and China (more or less) fought against them. Now I hope you're paying attention because, if not, you will be punished by having to read a big fat book on Chinese history.The performances are pretty good. Nice occasional use of Chopin, but John Williams' score tells us what to think and feel in no uncertain terms. In this respect it serves as an almost perfect complement to Steven Spielberg's effective and technically superb direction. Every shot of an airplane -- whether a home-made model or a P-51 -- is accompanied by a heavenly choir. So are celestial orbs. During moments that elicit sentiment we have a Welsh lullaby. The whole film is evocative and visually splendid.It nicely joins art with artifice. Commercially it could be described as a crossover movie. There's nothing much in it to offend any of the ethnic groups it deals with. Yes, the aristocratic Brits are a little snobby and unfeeling. And the Americans are scoundrels. But those are projections from inside the social borders. Brits and Americans can take it from one of their own. The Chinese for the most part are anonymous, except that once in a while they slap the kid's face while stealing his piano or a street thug beats Jim while trying to pull off his shoes in an alley. (I guess if you're going to offend someone you might as well make it the Chinese.) The Japanese are treated realistically. Some are friendlier and gentler than others but all of them show human emotions, even if the emotions are rage. We shouldn't be surprised that the Japanese at the internment camp whomp prisoners who defy their orders. My God, what they did to their own recruits at the Eta Navel Academy would make Parris Island look like Esalen. Japanese culture historically has been an odd blend of delicacy and cruelty, exemplified in the title of Ruth Benedict's The Chrysanthemum and the Sword. The longest section has to do with the prison camp and it's a little confusing in its details although we get the general picture. Everything seems to depend on whether you can find those extra cigarettes or swipe an additional potato. Erving Goffman described this sort of total institution and its small reward system evocatively.It's a big and generous film that spells epic with every frame. I don't know where it intended going though. There are some scenes that absolutely MUST have been lifted directly from Ballard's autobiographical novel. Footprints in the ashes that cover the bedroom floor. Jim, the central character, seems to have learned something. He begins as a superior snot, learns to survive while roughing it in a place where kids get no passes, and in the end comes full circle and goes home with his parents, presumably changed, in the sense of having discovered that, though survival comes first, there are boundaries beyond which behavior turns indecent.

Erving Goffman described this sort of total institution and its small reward system evocatively.It's a big and generous film that spells epic with every frame. I don't know where it intended going though. There are some scenes that absolutely MUST have been lifted directly from Ballard's autobiographical novel. Footprints in the ashes that cover the bedroom floor. Jim, the central character, seems to have learned something. He begins as a superior snot, learns to survive while roughing it in a place where kids get no passes, and in the end comes full circle and goes home with his parents, presumably changed, in the sense of having discovered that, though survival comes first, there are boundaries beyond which behavior turns indecent.

Its a film that falls alongside others like Fargo, Meet the Fockers and James and the Giant Peach. These are films that all failed to strike a chord with me when I first saw them. But after I rediscovered them, they went up considerably in my estimation.My first viewing of Spy Kids was not a pleasant one. I thought it was juvenile, stupid and sloppily plotted. In short, an overrated film that didn't deserve success or a trilogy. Still, there must have been something to the film otherwise I never would have come back to it.My second viewing of Spy Kids was a complete about face. I really had a great time. It no longer seemed juvenile but witty, fresh and inventive. Amazing how a film can seem completely different after you give it a second chance.The spy genre has had a sudden boost in the last few years. Kickstarted by GoldenEye, it brought Bond into the 90s, and was then followed by Austin Powers, a parody. Then came Spy Kids. Which also proved to be influential. Not only are there the sequels, but blatant rip offs like Agent Cody Banks, and even the excellent Pixar film The Incredibles has a shade of Spy Kids.One thing that shocks you right away about Spy Kids is that it was directed by Robert Rodriguez. This is the man responsible for no-holds barred material like the exceptional Sin City, as well as sharp and biting satire like The Faculty. But to Rodriguez's credit, he hasn't dumbed down. He's brought his natural, exciting style of film-making to Spy Kids, and crafted a rip-roaring adventure kids and adults will love.I could go into detail about the plot. But I'm not going to. Its inconsequential anyway. The real fun to be had is the dazzling display of stunt-work, special effects, visual sight gags and witty puns Rodriguez keeps throwing up at us. He's not always successful with special effects. Sometimes he indulges them to such an extent they swamp everything else. The exception being Sin City, where he melded it all into a breathtaking hyper-real world. And with Spy Kids, although I did notice obvious matte lines at times, he does a commendable job, and incorporates them without sacrificing narrative structure.Rodriguez has also assembled an imaginative and quite superb cast. Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino are good value as the retired spies forced back into action. I love the story of how they first met. If you've seen Mr & Mrs Smith you'll have a good idea of what they're like. And their heart-shaped parachutes are great.Alan Cumming is not bad as the one part children's presenter and other part criminal mastermind. Sort of like a cross between Pee-wee Herman and a Bond villain if such a thing is possible. And Tony Shalhoub is great as the power behind the throne. So is Fegan Floop's stronghold. A set so full of eye popping effects and surreal wackiness you're constantly blown away by what the filmmakers have gotten away with. Love the jigsaw puzzle floors too!But where Spy Kids really shines is Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara as the dynamic duo. They make a completely believable brother and sister. Affectionately sniping at each other while propelled by jet pack, piloting submarines and using quick dry cement that looks like Silly String. The whole film rests on their capable shoulders. Vega is especially impressive. She has that rare ability among children where she can seem capable but gracious, and Rodriguez draws out a great deal of strength from her character.The gadgets and gimmicks the writers come up with are very innovative. They beat the pants off anything Q could come up with. I'm especially partial to the electrically charged gum balls. And the dozens of robot kids put films with much higher budgets like I Robot and Bicentennial Man to shame. I love the use they're put to in the end.There are so many delights to this film. The sight of Teri Hatcher getting her hair burned off by jet pack is worth the price of admission alone. And watch out for George Clooney's cameo at the end.I'm glad I rediscovered Spy Kids. If I hadn't, I would have been missing out on a superior piece of family entertainment. Spy Kids soars just as high as any of this film's jet packs.

No matter how different things are in the future, his perspective doesn't change, his wry sense of humor stays the same, happily misplaced ragtime music plays over the movie, and old-fashioned sight gags are employed complete with the occasional stepped-up film speed.Allen has always done well playing virtually the same character in all of his movies, but his talent as an on screen comedian is milestoned in this performance. He has the brilliance to mock even the most elusive and unnoticed physical conventions of screen acting, for instance his whispering to Diane Keaton while they pose as doctors in the presence of several people close by. It's a nitpicky sense of humor that contributes greatly to the intelligence behind all of his manic goofiness.Diane Keaton is his match, however, whereas most of his leading ladies usually aren't. In fact, I hold Diane Keaton's performance in Sleeper as her crowning achievement so far that I've seen of her, even beyond her work in the Godfather films. She delivers great laughs. Her highlight is in what is possibly the funniest scene in the entire film, which eventually involves her doing an impression of Marlon Brando. Who would think that Diane Keaton would deliver the most convincing and dead-on Brando impression one has ever seen. While we're on the subject of that particular part of that hysterical scene that I will preserve for you to see for yourself, I must say that most people, even some of the most talented comedians and office\/class clowns can hardly come close to mimicking Brando's voice, expressions and mannerisms. Diane Keaton somehow nails it. In Sleeper, she gives one of the funniest performances I've ever seen from an actress. She and Allen are truly one of the funniest comic pairs I've ever seen in a movie.What makes Sleeper so funny is not just the physical comedy but the out-of-the-box, completely unorthodox creativity behind all of the physical comedy. There is a scene where someone slips on a banana peel. But the banana peel is the size of a canoe, as is the banana and all of the electronically preserved fruits and vegetables in this particular place, and Allen is being chased by a futuristic cop and both of them are slipping repeatedly on the peel. The film has robot butlers and maids of the future, and gradually throughout the film some are introduced as robots programmed to act and speak like effeminate gay men and Brooklyn Jewish stereotypes.

","genre":"Comedy, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"6 April 2007","score":"14 out of 15 people found the following review useful","review":" Sleeper is a comedy with one of the wittiest premises I've ever seen. It is a comedy about life in the 22nd century through a neurotic Jewish Brooklynite's cynical eyes. No matter how different things are in the future, his perspective doesn't change, his wry sense of humor stays the same, happily misplaced ragtime music plays over the movie, and old-fashioned sight gags are employed complete with the occasional stepped-up film speed.Allen has always done well playing virtually the same character in all of his movies, but his talent as an on screen comedian is milestoned in this performance. He has the brilliance to mock even the most elusive and unnoticed physical conventions of screen acting, for instance his whispering to Diane Keaton while they pose as doctors in the presence of several people close by. It's a nitpicky sense of humor that contributes greatly to the intelligence behind all of his manic goofiness.Diane Keaton is his match, however, whereas most of his leading ladies usually aren't. In fact, I hold Diane Keaton's performance in Sleeper as her crowning achievement so far that I've seen of her, even beyond her work in the Godfather films. She delivers great laughs. Her highlight is in what is possibly the funniest scene in the entire film, which eventually involves her doing an impression of Marlon Brando. Who would think that Diane Keaton would deliver the most convincing and dead-on Brando impression one has ever seen. While we're on the subject of that particular part of that hysterical scene that I will preserve for you to see for yourself, I must say that most people, even some of the most talented comedians and office\/class clowns can hardly come close to mimicking Brando's voice, expressions and mannerisms. Diane Keaton somehow nails it. In Sleeper, she gives one of the funniest performances I've ever seen from an actress. She and Allen are truly one of the funniest comic pairs I've ever seen in a movie.What makes Sleeper so funny is not just the physical comedy but the out-of-the-box, completely unorthodox creativity behind all of the physical comedy. There is a scene where someone slips on a banana peel. But the banana peel is the size of a canoe, as is the banana and all of the electronically preserved fruits and vegetables in this particular place, and Allen is being chased by a futuristic cop and both of them are slipping repeatedly on the peel. The film has robot butlers and maids of the future, and gradually throughout the film some are introduced as robots programmed to act and speak like effeminate gay men and Brooklyn Jewish stereotypes. There is also a great amount of intellectualism and cultural knowledge in even the zaniest of humorous moments in Sleeper, and that is what makes it one of Woody Allen's funniest films and a work of true comic genius.

By the way, yeah, this is one of those hokey and cheesy movies made in the 50's and 60's, but this is a darn good one.Here is the plot of this movie. Five strangers are invited by a millionaire to go to a mansion and have a nice little party. The only problem is that this is not a party. The five people actually have to spend the night in the house if they want $10,000. Sounds easy, right? Wrong. The house is haunted. During the night spooky things happen around the house. The millionaire's wife Annebelle is supposedly murdered, another guest Patrich is just creepy, a guest named Nora is scared of everything, and another guest named Trent does nothing. It turns out that Annebelle was never killed, and she and Trent try to kill the millionaire. They fail, and they fall in acid. Everyone else escapes.Overall, this is a cheesy and corny movie but it is very entertaining and you will get a few good laughs here and there. Some scenes are frightening, like when Nora is tapping on walls with Lance and a elderly woman on what appears to be on a skateboard comes out of nowhere and obviously frightens Nora, but you will definitely laugh at most scenes. Some scenes are overacted, and some acting is just plain weird, but a lot of characters are fun and nice, except for Patrich. He is just weird.

I do however hope, that I will have a chance to see it again, only on a much bigger screen. But I'd like to think that I got what this film was trying to achieve(and frankly, it did). And that is to be the most epic film ever made. The cinematography, the battle scenes, the music, the mood that is created by the surroundings(particularly the desert) - it all helps to create a grand epic masterpiece.The acting is mind blowing, too. Peter O'Toole's performance is convincing and it's amazing to see how the character slowly develops and becomes obsessed with the desert and in the end becomes completely lost in it's embrace. Alec Guinness' performance was also quite amazing and he acts his character out smoothly. Omar Sharif does a great work at portraying a strong character who is forced to watch his friend slowly plunge into madness.Possibly the only problem this movie has, is the length. It comes close to four hours, if I am not mistaken. But in my opinion the length is necessary. It is slow paced, but it just couldn't be any other way.

Father of the Bride is no exception to his well-deserved reputation. I loved the setting of the Bank's home, the comfortable two-story home on a tree-lined street. Elizabeth Taylor's bedroom, with its fireplace and its generous bay-window made me wonder why she got the best bedroom in the house and if she had regrets about leaving that lovely home to probably live in a small apartment. The family room, with its Victorian couch and leather chair, by the fireplace, helped me understand why the Banks family seemed so close; they had probably spent lots of time in that room together on cold, snowy nights. The kitchen was definitely a product of the 1940-1950's, rather sterile and sanitized, with its white metal cabinets. The idea of warm, country-style kitchens had gone out of fashion by that time by people in the same social class as the Banks. The dining room makes up for that coldness, with the beautiful dining room set and elaborate, silver candle sticks. Ellie and Stanley probably did a lot of entertaining in that room, she with her garden club and he with his clients from the law firm. I have seen the colorized version of the film and I was not offended by it. I rather enjoyed seeing some of the details of the home and the costumes come to life through the addition of color. I could see Elizabeth Taylor's famous violet eyes. The matching baby blue ensemble of matching dress and coat that she wore out on a date with Buckley said to the viewer, This is definitely a upper-middle class family of the 1950's. The fact that Miss Taylor's wardrobe was so expensive, coupled with the fact that she seemed to have no job except to be the fiancée of Buckley, left no doubt in the viewer's mind as to the kind of finishing school life she must have led as a daughter of Stanley Banks. I once read that her white slipper-satin and lace bridal dress was voted the best movie bridal dress and I agree with that vote. It was gorgeous and she was gorgeous in the dress. Ellie looked beautiful as the mother of the bride in her powder blue dress, with all of its elegance and attention to detail, validated Spencer Tracy's remark that she wore, in that dress, all of the beauty of her own wedding day. Yes, Ellie wore the years well, despite a being a busy mother of three and a woman with many 1950's social obligations. The church, with its elaborate floral arrangements, seem to be stand out more in the colorized version. The salmon pink color of the seven bridesmaid's dresses and matching juliet caps underscored the elegance and elaborate statement of the event and the fact that the father of the bride, in the end, spared no expense for his daughter's wedding.

It seems they had much in common - strong singing voices, a gift for comedy, and a vulnerability that made their personal lives less wonder than their stage ones. All in all, this a most auspicious beginning for Streisand's film career.The movie chronicles Fanny Brice's (Barbra Streisand) rise from wannabe actress to star of the Ziegfeld Follies. She starts out as a young woman who will do anything to get on stage, and once she gets her chance, her talents do not go unnoticed, ultimately leading Flo Ziegfeld (Walter Pidgeon) to ask her to audition for him. Their relationship is a bit rocky at first, as Ziegfeld wants total control of the actors in his show, and Fanny has some very definite ideas about what she will and won't do. But eventually they learn to respect each other. Along the way Fanny meets Nick Arnstein (Omar Sharif), a handsome and charming man who makes his living as a gambler. Perhaps predictably, they fall in love, and eventually marry. Unfortunately, it turns out to be a case of marry in haste, repent at leisure, as Fanny learns how much Nick spends gambling, and how much more important gambling is to him than she is. When Nick gets tired of being Mr. Brice and gets himself mixed up in a bond scandal in order to bring some money into the household, he is arrested, put on trial, and pleads guilty. As Nick leaves for jail, he suggests that he and Fanny divorce. Fanny doesn't want to, but will she change her mind in the eighteen months that Nick is in prison? It's a touching portrait of the vulnerability and insecurity that lies underneath a glittering exterior. Both Fanny and Nick present a beautiful facade to the public, but neither can help the other deal with the insecurities that drive them apart. In the end, Fanny is forced to confront the fact that being funny in public has given her a private life that is nothing to laugh about. Along the way, you get some wonderful singing and dancing. Streisand's talents for the musical stage were wonderfully showcased in the movie, as were her comedic talents.

It seems they had much in common - strong singing voices, a gift for comedy, and a vulnerability that made their personal lives less wonder than their stage ones. All in all, this a most auspicious beginning for Streisand's film career.The movie chronicles Fanny Brice's (Barbra Streisand) rise from wannabe actress to star of the Ziegfeld Follies. She starts out as a young woman who will do anything to get on stage, and once she gets her chance, her talents do not go unnoticed, ultimately leading Flo Ziegfeld (Walter Pidgeon) to ask her to audition for him. Their relationship is a bit rocky at first, as Ziegfeld wants total control of the actors in his show, and Fanny has some very definite ideas about what she will and won't do. But eventually they learn to respect each other. Along the way Fanny meets Nick Arnstein (Omar Sharif), a handsome and charming man who makes his living as a gambler. Perhaps predictably, they fall in love, and eventually marry. Unfortunately, it turns out to be a case of marry in haste, repent at leisure, as Fanny learns how much Nick spends gambling, and how much more important gambling is to him than she is. When Nick gets tired of being Mr. Brice and gets himself mixed up in a bond scandal in order to bring some money into the household, he is arrested, put on trial, and pleads guilty. As Nick leaves for jail, he suggests that he and Fanny divorce. Fanny doesn't want to, but will she change her mind in the eighteen months that Nick is in prison? It's a touching portrait of the vulnerability and insecurity that lies underneath a glittering exterior. Both Fanny and Nick present a beautiful facade to the public, but neither can help the other deal with the insecurities that drive them apart. In the end, Fanny is forced to confront the fact that being funny in public has given her a private life that is nothing to laugh about. Along the way, you get some wonderful singing and dancing.

It is also, after the hotch-potch of Jabberwocky, Gilliam's first fully-fledged feature film.Time Bandits is about the power of a child's imagination, particularly in the face of the dullness of bland TV. Kevin's family home, packed with high-tech labour-saving devices, seems cramped and puckered up, and is dwarfed by the grandeur of the historical settings. It's not an anti-technology statement as such, but more an attack on the impersonal nature of modern gadgetry, which Gilliam would come back to in his masterpiece, Brazil.This is also a film about the problems of childhood. Kevin is ignored by his parents, and his imagination is stifled. But when he is with the dwarfs, he becomes listened to and respected. It's the antithesis of the statement children should be seen and not heard. Gilliam also goes a long way to creating a child's (or dwarfs) eye view, both physically, keeps his camera at waist height (making Ralph Richardson look absolutely huge) and in terms of the film's outlook. For example, most of the comedy comes from ridiculing the worries of the adult world &#150; Napoleon's anxiety over his height, the ogres mid-life crisis and, of course, Michael Palin's problem.The fact that the story is about time travelling allows Gilliam to flex his imagination to the greatest extent since his days as Monty Python animator. Travelling from one historical setting to another, and eventually into the realms of fantasy, Gilliam must really have felt like a kid with the biggest train set in the world (to paraphrase Orson Welles). The story is incredibly fast-paced and we never dwell too long in one era, but Gilliam still manages to cram as many ideas as possible into each setting. The fifteen minutes or so set in the middle ages is funnier than the entirety of Jabberwocky. One of the few similarities to Jabberwocky in fact is Gilliam's warts-and-all portrayal of history.And how could I forget to mention the dwarfs? This is their picture too, and alongside the ideas about childhood this is also a rarity in that it actors with dwarfism a chance to play real characters, rather than just be body type specialists. And there truly are some great actors among them. David Rapapport (Randall), who had the most acting experience, clearly relishes his role, but the real standout is Jack Purvis (Wally). His performance is the most powerful, and in the later scenes in particular he manages to convey so much emotion in the way he moves and the way he screws up is face.The cast is good all round in fact. Gilliam would frequently cast against type in his later work, and while that's not quite the case here there's an eclectic mix of cameos that creates some very unusual but brilliant characters. Although it's quite small, this is my favourite Sean Connery performance &#150; he shows real warmth and fatherliness, and clearly took the role seriously in spite of it being a small part in a cheap film. Ian Holm and John Cleese vie for funniest role as Napoleon and Robin Hood respectively (by the way, for those who don't know, Cleese is basing his portrayal on Prince Phillip). And Time Bandits also ends centuries of theological debate by proving once and for all, that Ralph Richardson IS God.When I first saw this as a kid of about the same age as Kevin himself, I was really disappointed by the ending. It's not a sad ending as such, it just makes you go uh? In fact this is kind of a Gilliam trademark &#150; plenty of his films end with the good guys technically winning, but with the hero ending up worse off. It's also an ending that is appropriate even though it's tough for kids to accept, because as much as anything else Time Bandits is about the end of childhood. Along his journey Kevin learns that sometimes heroes aren't all they're cracked up to be, and also that the most important thing in the adult world is money. Finally, he is abandoned and left to fend for himself &#150; the comfortable world of childhood has gone.I'll also mention an interesting little fact about George Harrison's involvement in this film. As many people know, the ex-Beatle executive produced Time Bandits. He had various ideas about how the film should be made and frequently clashed with Gilliam. In the end, Gilliam managed to overrule him, and Harrison's only contribution to the finished product was writing the song that plays over the end credits. It's a great tune (Harrison was in my opinion the best songwriter in the Beatles), but as Gilliam points out in his commentary, the lyrics are actually nothing to do with the film. They are in fact an anti-Gilliam rant, something which the director himself only realised (to his amusement) after the picture was released.Time Bandits is a film about a child's imagination being set free &#150; but it is really Gilliam's imagination that is being set free. It's the first time he really escapes from the shadow of Monty Python, and paved the way for future masterpieces.
