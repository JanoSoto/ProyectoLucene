[{"date":"29 September 2013","score":"","review":" Matrix for me was amazing. I couldn't get enough watch it. All those flying effects just made me say WOW so many times. It is just simply amazing. It would be such an amazing thing if this may be implemented in real life too. I loved the slow time effect, it just made the film perfect and became very popular effect, these days people are using it a lot. To be honest this film is speechless. Beside the motion graphics. I liked the movements and martial fighting. Gave a very strong and powerful action combined with graphic effects. You definitely can realize the martial fighting movements are so perfect followed with that slow time effect. Honest since this film I used that effect a lot.
