What makes this film so much better is the way it feels. There is gloom and despair in the air and Gene Hackman turns in the performance of his career as Harry Caul, the best 'sound bugger' on the west coast, who has no home phone, hates extra sets of keys, and dislikes swearing.  He creates such an original character and Coppola stages such an original and shocking story, the film is a perfect blend of character study, plot, and atmosphere.  Harry comes to the realization that his work indirectly hurts people and this no longer bodes well to him.The film is slow and almost dream-like in appearance.  There is even a dream sequence that is so powerful and nightmarish, it stays with you.  Nothing Coppola did before (THE GODFATHER, wrote PATTON) could prepare you for such an original and unclassifiable movie.  1974 was quite a year for the great filmmaker, with CONVERSATION and GODFATHER PART II both up for Best Picture. No doubt THE CONVERSATION is better, just completely out of left field. The apt title relates to the job Hackman and his assistants are working on as the movie starts.  Cindy Williams and Frederic Forest (Chef from APOCALYPSE NOW)  are circling a courtyard in San Francisco, discussing a supposed infidelic relationship.  They may even be in great danger.  A mysterious director of an unknown corporation wants the dialogue of their conversation and Hackman begins to have second thoughts about the situation.Coppola sets up the viewer with such subtle effectiveness, you don't even realize it.  Hackman's character is so good at what he does, he brings his work home and wonders how his landlady was able to leave him a birthday card without a key.  He is so distraught, he leaves himself open to the same indirect pain and suffering his brilliant recording work sometimes causes. His world is small and lonely (his best friend is his sax) and you find that there is an industry behind Hackman's technical work.  His studio lab is where the conversation is dissected and, depending on how attentive you are, Coppola builds to a riveting and surprising finale.  Harry Caul may be the 'best bugger' on the west coast, but he is human and cracks begin to show.Look at the cast.  If this film was made today, the cost would be staggering considering the star power.

The catch  once Neo finds out what The Matrix is, his life will never be the same again.And so begins the adventure for Neo, who must put aside his own disbelief in order to defeat the Gatekeepers and the traitor Cypher (Joe Pantoliano) save Morpheus' life, all while falling in love with Morpheus' second-in-command, Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss).  Not bad for a lowly software programmer. Admittedly, the plot for The Matrix sounds a little weak and the dialogue is pretty cheesy (we're given lines like `Hold on Dorothy, &#145;cause Kansas is going bye-bye.'), but the film is able to pull it off, mostly with the help of some brilliant special effects.

Mass.Illusions, LLC, the same parent company that achieved technical wizardry with What Dreams May Come, once again shines through here with some impressive freeze-frame motion special effects.

For all of his talent, Laurence Fishburne (Just Cause, Hoodlum) is only given so much to do, to the point where he is neither a plus or a minus in the film.  The same holds true for Carrie-Ann Moss (Sabotage, The Secret Life of Algernon), who seems too preoccupied with her love for Neo and so comes off as being an extremely one-dimensional character.  Even the film's most interesting character, Agent Smith, as the leader of the Gatekeepers, is overdone too the point of being annoying.  This is a shame because the dry, cynical way in which Australian actor Hugo Weaving(The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, Reckless Kelly) portrays him is for the most part a welcome deviation from the robot-like interpretations of every other character in the movie. The bottom line is that The Matrix is worth seeing if for no other reason than to be blown away by some really cool visual effects.

As good as Face\/Off may seem, we have to remember it is still given the Hollywood treatment. Less guns, less bullets, less death, and a happy ending. Of course, for the regular neutered American filmgoer, this seems like a GOOD thing. But for REAL hardened action fans, this Hollywood intervention is an unwelcome intrusion. For all the fireworks in Face\/Off, it still does not even come close to matching up with even ten minutes of Hard-Boiled or The Killer. These two Hong Kong movies are John Woo's REAL masterpieces, not tied down by any ropes or watered-down to fit the standards of any major movie company.However, that being said, Face\/Off is certainly a masterpiece in American standards. Woo manages to still offer us an energetic and eye-pleasing action movie despite being tied down by Hollywood. The plot in this movie, while comical, is very engaging. A little known fact about this movie is that it was originally meant to be set in the future. That would better explain the validity of the operation AND that wacky futuristic prison. However, Woo refused to do this, and the movie is much better because of it.The complications of Castor Troy turning into Sean Archer and vice versa are brilliant. Sean turns into the very man he has loathed and despised. He is reminded of him every time he looks in the mirror. Castor, on the other hand, turns into the man who has been chasing him with passion for years. This turn of events causes major psychological trauma for both characters (although Cage's character shows it a lot more). The extent of these emotions are limited on screen as Woo chooses to push that aspect of the story away and instead focus on the action. Good choice!Make no bones about it, this is not a psychological drama. It has John Woo behind the camera, so it's a full-tilt action film. As in his Hong Kong films, Woo manages to make EVERYONE look more cool than they really are. Case in point, has Cage EVER looked cooler than the opening scene when he exits his car and his overcoat goes flapping around in the wind?The most brilliant example of Woo's genius is the scene when Cage and Travolta are back-to-back with each other with only a mirror separating them. When they both turn away and point guns at each other's image, you can't help but get chills at how brilliant this is. They're both pointing their guns at the very man they hate, and even though it is really themselves, shooting at that image could kill the enemy. As complicated as it is smart, Face\/Off has many scenes that envoke chills like this.And of course, the raw unorthodoxed action...the only moment that this film felt like a Hong Kong movie was the scene when Cage slides on the floor to shoot at the SWAT member breaking into their hideout. The camera follows Cage sliding on the ground while sparks fly all around him. This just screamed Hong Kong action all the while and it was beautiful! The final church shootout was ripped off from The Killer (but severely diluted), and the boat scene was also something out of The Killer. That being said, both were well-done and actually made the movie!The plot does seem a bit far-fetched, but it is as interesting as it is implausible. People need to stop looking at this film as a true-life action film and start looking at it like a sci-fi film (since that's what it was originally supposed to be). That is, keep your mind open and you won't be tied down by the physics and technology of today. Take the story as it is and breathe in the premise of the story and not the reality of it. Seen in that light, Face\/Off is certainly an action masterpiece and one that John Woo should be proud of despite its lack of punch and flair that was present in The Killer and Hard-Boiled.

However, Woo refused to do this, and the movie is much better because of it.The complications of Castor Troy turning into Sean Archer and vice versa are brilliant. Sean turns into the very man he has loathed and despised. He is reminded of him every time he looks in the mirror. Castor, on the other hand, turns into the man who has been chasing him with passion for years. This turn of events causes major psychological trauma for both characters (although Cage's character shows it a lot more). The extent of these emotions are limited on screen as Woo chooses to push that aspect of the story away and instead focus on the action. Good choice!Make no bones about it, this is not a psychological drama. It has John Woo behind the camera, so it's a full-tilt action film. As in his Hong Kong films, Woo manages to make EVERYONE look more cool than they really are. Case in point, has Cage EVER looked cooler than the opening scene when he exits his car and his overcoat goes flapping around in the wind?The most brilliant example of Woo's genius is the scene when Cage and Travolta are back-to-back with each other with only a mirror separating them. When they both turn away and point guns at each other's image, you can't help but get chills at how brilliant this is. They're both pointing their guns at the very man they hate, and even though it is really themselves, shooting at that image could kill the enemy. As complicated as it is smart, Face\/Off has many scenes that envoke chills like this.And of course, the raw unorthodoxed action...the only moment that this film felt like a Hong Kong movie was the scene when Cage slides on the floor to shoot at the SWAT member breaking into their hideout. The camera follows Cage sliding on the ground while sparks fly all around him. This just screamed Hong Kong action all the while and it was beautiful! The final church shootout was ripped off from The Killer (but severely diluted), and the boat scene was also something out of The Killer. That being said, both were well-done and actually made the movie!The plot does seem a bit far-fetched, but it is as interesting as it is implausible. People need to stop looking at this film as a true-life action film and start looking at it like a sci-fi film (since that's what it was originally supposed to be). That is, keep your mind open and you won't be tied down by the physics and technology of today. Take the story as it is and breathe in the premise of the story and not the reality of it. Seen in that light, Face\/Off is certainly an action masterpiece and one that John Woo should be proud of despite its lack of punch and flair that was present in The Killer and Hard-Boiled.

I was blown away!  Everybody in the theatre sat slack jawed afterward for about 10 minutes.  Mysteriously, after seeing previews and ads for a few weeks, they seemed to disappear.  When the trailers reappeared and a release date was announced I tried to temper my enthusiasm.  Rarely does a film with such eye popping effects in a trailer deliver on that promise.  I fully expected to pay my $8.50 and find the best material was in the trailer. All I knew of the Wachowski brothers at that point was Bound.  Great modern noir thriller Bound was (and it really was) it didn't exactly set me up for a brilliant cyber punk sci fi action thrillerThe thing which elevates The Matrix from simple eye candy to great cinema is the fact that the special effects don't exist merely to be pretty.  Every effect makes sense in the plot.  The stop and circle around perspective effect first unveiled in the memorable Gap advertising campaign last year, used again in Wing Commander, is utilized here in such a way that the action wouldn't have made any sense without it.  The cgi effects manage to work without that over slick seamlessness which so often makes them look ridiculous.  Instead the film makers have created a world where every cgi character seems perfectly at home.I am not the sort of person who normally sees a film twice, with so many great movies out there I can barely manage to get to see everything I want to once!  After two viewings I am still impressed by the visual impact of this film.   Every aspect of design from great costumes to really great sets is there.  The men are dressed as sexy as the women yet nobody looks ridiculous.  When Keanu goes to his work cubicle even those of us who've never had a corporate job know how he feels.   As great as it all looks the film still manages to be plot driven, rather than an exercise in visual coolness.  There is not a moment wasted.Keanu Reeves has often been criticized for his performances, perhaps because he has picked a couple of inappropriate roles for himself.  In The Matrix he works well.  His martial arts sequences are wonderfully performed as well as being amazingly choreographed.  He has a couple of lines which even make him appear to have a sense of humour about himself.  If you look at his entire body of work, he has done as much good work as bad but his bad work is sooo bad!Laurence Fishburne, of course, is as brilliant as ever.  Carrie-Anne Moss is a woman heroine rather than a pretty sideliner.  As a woman I particularly enjoyed seeing a female character who is pretty and tough without being either of the extremes we are accustomed to in film.  She isn't Linda Hamilton steroid tough.  She's not an unbelievable pretty girl like Denise Richardson in Starship Troopers.  Joe Pantoliano is one of those bad guys who audiences love to hate.  He is not simply evil, he appears to take great glee in his badness.I am writing this review because when I drove to work this morning the morning radio guys were talking about the film.  They enjoyed it but essentially dismissed it as eye candy while berating Keanu Reeves' performance.  I simply can't believe they saw the same film I did!  To me it ranked right up there as a perfect futuristic science fiction piece with 12 Monkeys and Blade Runner.    When it comes out on DVD I'm sure Ill be buying it!Of course, after having said all of that, if you weren't impressed by the trailer, you probably won't like the film either.
