I knew he could do it; he just needed a chance.A Goofy Movie turns out to be something of a mixed bag, and as a result there are things I love about the movie and things I can't stand about it. I don't consider it a successful piece, really, but neither do I consider it a disaster.The plot is very simple and revolves around an easily-relatable-by-the-audience misunderstanding due to details I won't take the time to go into here due to their being too numerous and too revealing, Goofy becomes convinced that Max is on the verge of becoming a juvenile delinquent while Max is convinced that being Goofy's son is a major threat to his chances of having a normal life. As a result, they end up taking a cross-country vacation as unresolved tensions pile up until the inevitable.As far as the plot goes, it actually works much better than paid critics would have you believe. The reason for this is because the tension's pressure cooker is depicted so superbly. Despite the gags, the tension succeeds in piling up worse and worse and WORSE to the point where you can't really relax watching the film. At one particular moment near the climax in which Max points out which way to go on a particular freeway intersection at the very last minute, you can cut the atmosphere with a knife. I mean, it is *awful*. But awful in a good, convincing way for the plot, if you know what I mean, not written terribly awful. You have to experience it for yourself to see what I mean.The movie is carried reasonably, and believes in its own concept enough to work. It also has surprisingly good songs. And it's heartfelt even if, like all of Disney's most recent input, it seems to merely walk up to the edge of the heartfelt emotions it's reaching for instead of bravely walking over the edge to grasp them and going for the gusto (the same problem that currently plagues such Disney projects as the Proud Family and The Emperor's New Groove). Goofy's appeal helps here, of course, and certainly helps carry the movie over the things in it I personally don't care for.Now as for what I didn't like there's a bit character here, a friend of Max's (I can never remember his name) who wears glasses and has a thing for cheese. I personally find his cheese antics so disgusting and repulsive that he single-handedly succeeds in sinking nearly the entire movie for me! He remains one of the main reasons why I won't actually *buy* this movie because he just makes me queasy with every appearance. Not only that, but this is the first animated film I've ever seen which actually succeeds in making pizza look gross to the point of being nauseating (a la Pizza The Hut from SPACEBALLS) and it's *really* saying something in my case, since I'm a *HUGE* pizza-lover, when I remark that I wouldn't touch pizza for a long time after seeing this flick.The animation is done smoothly and well-coordinated for the most part even though it was all farmed out instead of being done in-house. The draftsmanship, however, is simply atrocious. The animators here simply go through the motions with Goofy and the rest of the characters without making that little special effort to make them more visually appealing; the limbs, for example, are simply drawn as black hoses in Goofy's case instead of any attempt to add definition or figure, and they move like unjointed rubber instead of with the famous Disney Illusion of Life. In fact, A GOOFY MOVIE demonstrates well how carelessness in the draftsmanship can threaten to sabotage an animated film (by comparison, the Australian-based animation of Goofy on HOUSE OF MOUSE demonstrates draftsmanship constructed with genuine love and care it puts A GOOFY MOVIE to shame).Still, despite these quibbles, I do like the movie alright and rent it on occasion (once every few months or so) and enjoy it simply because Goofy's appeal and certain pluses in it outweigh the minuses enough for me to see it once in a while. I personally find AN EXTREMELY GOOFY MOVIE an improvement even though its draftsmanship isn't too much better. A GOOFY MOVIE isn't the sort of quality Goofy project I've come to expect from classic Disney, not by a long shot, but it's do.

The best old movie I've seen (except for Chaplin's Limelight of course, which is the best movie I've ever seen)!!. What dragged it a bit down was that it dragged a bit out after that. I think it could have still maintained the great position if it had just ended after the shoot-out or when Harmonica came into the house and said he had to leave. I didn't really need to see his companion, who also had to leave, die. I didn't feel anything for that guy, so that was just a bit irrelevant.

(The fact that it was nominated for an academy award made me rethink every thought I've ever had. I'm afraid to leave the house now, because I think that was a sign of the coming apocolypse.) The cuts are far to quick and it seems to have arbitrary cutaways thrown in that make no sense whatsoever. It was impossible to follow, because there isn't a single shot in this movie that lasts longer than 2.5 seconds. All flashy cuts do is confuse the viewer. They aren't hip or cool or innovative, they're just plain ridiculous (believe me, I know what I'm talking about. I'm a professional editor.) The whole idea of editing is to cut the film together into a coherent story so the viewer can enjoy it-and this film failed miserably. All it did was give me a headache.  To be fair, the editor is a very skilled editor who probably was just doing her best with what that no-talent hack of a director gave her. I have to believe the A.D.D. style of cutting was his vision, not hers. Check out Road to Perdition or Elizabeth to see her true skills.What was with the gratuitous slow-motion? Every other shot was in slo-mo for apparantly no reason at all.The singing made me want to sharpen a pencil and shove it directly into my ear. Seeing a fat man singing  Like a Virgin is going to cost me years of therapy and lots of sleepless nights. Kurt Cobain is turning over in his grave, and if I ever hear Your Song by Elton John again, I may set myself on fire to distract me from the pain. ...THE MOON SINGS! What the f**K?Not to mention, the story was awful. This was a just a very superficial depiction of love. The story is what holds a film together. No matter how pretty you make it, without a good story, it's just a complete waste of time. I shudder to think of some potentially great movie that didn't get made because this piece of crap did.I was EMBARRASSED to watch this movie, and I was alone when I watched it, so figure that out.

(The fact that it was nominated for an academy award made me rethink every thought I've ever had. I'm afraid to leave the house now, because I think that was a sign of the coming apocolypse.)

It was like watching a snake digest a rat. But let's have some fun and pull this baby apart, shall we. First of all, There is nothing technical about Whipped that works. The visuals are all sitcom style. The cut scenes all just pictures of the street traffic going by at night over and over. The music and score, not only doesn't contribute anything to the movie - it's obnoxious. Not to mention it doesn't have anything to contribute to anyway.

It shows us nothing we haven't seen a thousand times before. The whole premise, or twist, of this movie is based on male-bashing and the idea that an empowered women can play men just as they get played. Anybody, that thinks this is somehow a twist or is in any way original has obviously never turned on a TV before. Twisted, shallow women are common. Male-bashing is the norm. It's not stealing from anything specifically, it's worse it's stealing from clichés. I can't imagine a women making a movie that depicted other women based so much on stereotypes and with this sense of contempt. Makes me want to go rent In the Company of Men - or better yet, There's Something About Mary. This movie wants to be a edgier version of There's Something About Mary so bad you can see the sweat. The movie has no insights into women, men, dating, sex, or really anything. Cohen is simply content to regurgitate myths he has been indoctrinated with from other sexist movies. On the other end, the movie doesn't work as a satire either, because even though it is ripe with exaggerations one could view as satirical it doesn't have that grounding in reality that satires need. It doesn't even know what it's satirizing. Then there's the dialogue, which is little more then the characters screaming obscenities at each other.  Example Character 1 F**k you Character 2 Oh yeah, well f**k you (repeat)And the bottom line, the thing that could excuse all the other discretions There are a lot of movies without plots, without good acting, with morally repulsive characters and obscenity laced dialogue that have been funny and thus, been good. Whipped ain't funny. Not for a second. It has no comic skills or timing. The situations are all completely phony, not based in any shred of truth, especially enough to wring laughs out of us. The characters all broadly drawn so they will SEEM relatable to the lowest of the lowest common denominator. Just look at the marquee scene, cult classic hair gel scene. One of our bumbling anti-heroes opens the medicine cabinet and sees Mena (Peet)'s vibrator. For some reason light shines down on it as if he's found the holy grail. Why Cohen thinks men react this way to vibrators I do not know. While he rubs it on himself, he drops it in the toilet and then attempts to fish it out with his bare hands when, oh my, Mena walks in on him. Oh, my sides. But strangely enough, people actually like this movie. Of course, people also like Friends and reality dating shows so I shouldn't be surprised. All of this has a common thread however. Whipped is big evidence to me that there is just a huge pocket of people in America that will laugh at any joke just because it is about sex. They will like any show or movie (or think they like it) just because it is about dating or relationships. It's lack of any quality has no baring on these people. Just as people are indoctrinated to want whiter teeth and thinner bodies to sell toothbrushes and weight loss programs, they are also indoctrinated to blindly lap up anything dating\/relationship related to sell them cheap, empty, effortless TV, movies and any number of products.

I mean if you want to be clever and write up a manifesto, at least lets stick to the rules. Looking at the DVD, his name and all of the actors are credited when really they shouldn't be. They shouldn't even be acknowledged on this website as having specific 'jobs' in the film. In all honesty there should just be one long list of names.Classing a film as 'new wave' or 'experimental' just seems to be a marketing ploy i.e. a bandwagon for everybody to jump on. Looking at the IMDb rating and some of the comments, lots of people have done just that.With this film it just seems to be a case of 'I know, we'll go into public places and pretend to be handicapped, we'll try to be as controversial as possible and get somebody with a shaky hand to film it all with a hand held digital camera. Then we'll edit it together in a haphazard fashion and say we're rebelling against continuity'. The film doesn't work, the ideas are weak and why you even need a director for this catastrophe is still open to question.Oh how I cheered when our lead lady Karen was slapped hard across the face in the final scene. It should have come earlier, but all the same it was well delivered and of course thoroughly deserved.I warn people, do not try to look for things that aren't there. This isn't a good film - it's a bad documentary. 0\/10 ","genre":"Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"28 May 2003","score":"85 out of 96 people found the following review useful","review":"  This is one of my top-ten favorite movies of all time.

I thought it would be another lame bit of Van Dammage, just like all the others, but wow! This is in a league of it's own. First of all, let me say this it's not a good film of course, it isn't! The script's diabolical, the acting is dreadful and the plot has got to be one of the silliest ever written.Oh yes, but Knock Off works because it is truly bonkers. Truly out of its mind. Tsui Hark is a great director (check out the insane Zu Warriors of the Magic Mountain, as well as the Hark produced A Chinese ghost Story, which is truly wonderful) and his irreverent approach works wonders here. Some of the camerawork here has to be seen to be believed here, we have a shot from the inside of a shoe, the camera moving through a wall and through a computer...while, the action is wildly OTT and hilariously preposterous. Rough around the edges it may be, but the action is genuinely imaginative stuff. Like Van Damme's Hard Target, Knock Off has been blessed with a director who can stage great action, but unlike the irritatingly melodramatic john woo, Hark directs as though he's having a great time even the dramatic (!) scenes border on intentional parody. And then there's Jean Claude Van Damme, easily the funniest out of all the Schwarzenegger\/Stallone\/Seagal crowd. Funniest? Why? Cos he really looks like he's trying, bless 'im! The scenes where he gets all emotional (check out the bit when he confronts Hendricks on the roof top 'YOU LIED TO ME!') are painfully funny because he just can't act at all. And because of his accent, lines like 'Don't you understand what you do....i-fax me?' (the 'i-fax' is supposed to be 'affects') sound highly amusing. Unlike that dullard Steven Seagal, van Damme's limitations as an actor are precisely what makes him watchable. Then there's the deeply stupid Rob Schneider, who plays EXACTLY the same role in everything he's ever done, and Paul Sorvino, who continues to destroy whatever credibilty he gained starring as Pauly Cicero in GoodFellas.Plus, what's with the green explosions? The walkie-talkie dropping into the gangster's hand from nowhere? The bullet-shot that goes through the can of beans? Rob Schneider whipping Van Damme with a fish? The song at the end of the film? It's a complete mess! Knock Off is easily Van Damme's best film, without a shadow of a doubt. It's utter rubbish, yet it's one of the funniest films I've ever seen. Of course, you need plenty of irony and an appreciation for stupid action movies to really get the most out of this. there are some people who will think that Knock Off is absolutely atrocious.

Moulin Rouge was repeatedly lauded for being artistic by its fans.  No description could be less apt.  The dizzying camera effects, the lavish sets and sequinned costumes, and the purchased rights to sample just about every pop song from the last thirty years these are not the visions of an artist; they are the machinations of an egomaniac with a morbidly obese budget.All chance of subtlety destroyed in the first few minutes, Moulin Rouge goes on to state its three virtues truth, beauty, and most of all love, which it will repeat the names of ad nauseum.  Let's look at those one by one. Truth is utterly lacking in this film.  Set in a turn-of-the-century whorehouse, the production is glitzier than Broadway's 42nd Street. Neither this nor the utterly generic plot lends any bit of credence to its claims of truth.  Beauty is not to be found either, as the film is so gaudy that even Nicole Kidman can not stand out.  Her quiet, nymph-like beauty does not go well at all with her surroundings, and she appears pale and sickly (only foreshadowing the end by sheer dumb luck).  That brings me to love, which is the the most sorely lacking part of the movie.  At what point do the main characters fall in love?  Never.  Their relationship consists of idiotic musical numbers and the word love bounced back and forth faster than a ping pong ball carrying the plague.

Fortune smiles on some and laughs at others. I simply found this movie to depict real life in a sense. Real life meaning that we all assume that we know it all. That we, as human beings, make the rules. This is what I gathered from the movie. I also enjoy the professor. He chose to do something new and exciting. He chose to break up the monotony. He got bored of doing the same old thing over and over and so he chose a life of adultery as an escape from the norm. Oh, how many people believe that sex is the answer to their marital problems. HA HA. I just found his story to be the most believable and conceivable. Thanks for reading my input.

In a way this is certainly true, Kurosawa embraces the tragic, maybe to excess.  (The only happy ending I can think of in a Kurosawa film is Yojimbo).There is an interesting parallel though, which adds depth to Saburo's death.The snipers are an afterthought.  Jiro orders them out, then basically forgets all about them.  He is already high-tailing it to the castle when they catch up to their target (actually, I think he might be on the verge of seppuku at that point, I don't remember).This is very very similar to the burning of the peasant village earlier in the movie.  Hidetora orders a peasant village burned, for completely stupid reasons.  He is quickly talked out of it ... but nobody ever thinks to cancel the order.  Later, somebody mentions ... hey, do you smell something?.  There is no further explanation of this line ... it is the peasant village, burning.  They forgot.This is Kurosawa humor, very very dark humor.Personally, I think the shooting of Saburo was intentionally a parallel to this earlier moment.  Seen that way, Hidetora is definitely getting a karma moment.His (Hidetora's) own death, I agree, is kind of just thrown in there, but if you see the link between his crimes and Saburo's death, and that Saburo's death lead to his, it makes a little more sense.Dark dark humor indeed.
