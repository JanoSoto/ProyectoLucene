The trick of enjoying this movie is to not just watch what Tom green does, but the expression on his face and the things he says after it, he says and does a lot of things which if people hadn't been so grossed out from the last scene would rate amongst the funniest they've ever seen. When i say funny, I mean stupid or ridiculous funny such as the petrol fight in zoolander, or the donkey scene in clerks two. My advice to people who like ridiculous comedy such as that made by the Will Farrel, Owen Wilson, Ben Stiller group or Kevin Smith etc. and didn't like Freddy Got Fingered is to watch this movie again ignoring the graphical parts of scenes such as the hospital scene or the farm scene, and listening out for comments like I saved the day Betty, look daddy I'm a farmer, Japan 4 or I bought you jewels and you'll probably get at least a few laughs.

Not that it is all bad...you do get a spooky séance scene, a great image involving a little girl seeing a boy underwater, and a somewhat interesting conclusion. The acting features George C Scott and he is rather good and adds a bit to the film. Though I have to say he does not react very well the first time he sees the specter in the tub as he might as well just saw some hair in the drain. The story has a composer of piano music losing his wife and daughter at the beginning of the film. He moves far away in hopes of getting his life back on track and somehow ends up renting one big house. Well as with most haunted house flicks of this type you have your little noises here and there and strange shifting objects as well. Throughout the movie you join Scott's character as he unravels a very old mystery involving tenants that owned the house back in the early 1900's. Suffice to say you learn the mystery to soon and you have to much movie left when you find out the secret. The rest of the movie feels like padding which you do not need in a nearly two hour movie. They could have easily trimmed this down a bit. Also, the whole secret at the end makes me think the spook in this one has some misdirected anger issues. There also is not a lot going on in this one to garner it an R rating. I have seen movies that contain more risqué scenes in this era get PG (Bond movies for instance), why they felt the need to make this one an R is beyond me. However, do not take my word for it as from the score here it is liked more than not...just was not for me.

It's also the eighteenth installment in the franchise. Brosnan's first stint in the role, 1995's GoldenEye (the first of the 90's films in the franchise), perhaps turned out to be the best Bond film since the 1970's. However, after that film, this 1997 follow-up showed the franchise taking a couple steps down again. While Tomorrow Never Dies is better than a number of its predecessors, especially Roger Moore's last couple ones, its lack of consistency makes it a little weak.Elliot Carver is a powerful, megalomaniac media baron whose broadcasting can reach the entire world, with the exception of China, where it is rejected by the country's current leaders. Determined to reach China so he can feed his ego, he plans to start a war between China and the United Kingdom, to put an end to the current regime in the eastern country! After a British battleship goes under in Chinese waters, evidence suggests that Carver was behind it, so James Bond is sent to investigate. On the mission, he meets a former lover of his, Paris Carver, who is now married to Elliot, and attempts to get information from her. Eventually, Bond meets Chinese agent Wai Lin, and together they must stop Elliot Carver from carrying out his evil plans, before it's too late! This eighteenth official Bond film has another action packed opening sequence. The opening sequence of this particular film makes it look promising, but after that, it seems to go downhill rather quickly, and doesn't pick up again until later (if it didn't pick up again at all, I couldn't rate it higher than 5\/10). An example of a dull moment is the romantic scene between Bond and Paris Carver. Teri Hatcher doesn't put on a very good performance as Paris, and it's probably a good thing the character isn't in the movie for very long. There is some humour here and there, including a scene with Bond and Q (no surprise there), but that's not enough to make up for the lack of excitement. I found that the film finally picks up again when Bond and Wai Lin start fighting off enemies together (they make a good pair). I'm not sure why, since there is some action beforehand. After that started, I think I found the rest of the film pretty exciting, but this was a while into it.While some don't like Pierce Brosnan as James Bond, I think he was a fine choice for the role, but just because he can play the part doesn't mean this is a very good film. Sometimes in the franchise, a good film can come, but then the next one can turn out to be a significant drop from that one, and unfortunately, I think that's the case with this one coming after GoldenEye. Tomorrow Never Dies is certainly not the weakest Bond film, as I've already mentioned (it's not like Roger Moore's last couple ones, which I think I found to be almost frustratingly tiresome, good thing the franchise improved after those), but it's sadly inferior to quite a few Bond films that came before it.

Seeing as this is the movie that came after the Toy Story movies I must say that they have come a ways with the technology...or at least I realized this once I watched the special features on the disc that told me so and pointed out all the little things that I didn't realize before like all the leaves moving and the different shadows and the hair on each bug's back....Really and truly this is Pixar and I don't feel that the animation quality should be the major judging point on this film as that is sure to be top notch. The story is where things really need to come into play. Well This story follows an ant that isn't quite getting along with the other antz in that conformist thing that they like to do. (Also seen in the plot from the movie Antz which now that I think about it is kind of creepy with both films coming out so close together) Anycase our hero ant has to save the colony that treats him like trash against evil bully insects that are out to extort them for food. This adventure brings up a cast of colorful and friendly characters that have many comic moments throughout the film.Overall the story is about working together to accomplish something that couldn't have been accomplished alone. Good lesson overall but still not extremely high class.In the end if you strip away the technological glitter A Bug's life is a charming little family movie with a plot that is entertaining but nothing highly innovative. Still worth a watch and if you are a fan of Pixar like I am you won't be ashamed of having it in your collection though I feel it is the weakest of the Pixar titles.Best wishes hope you enjoy the film.

As for their latest, FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION, the less said the better.The film appears to be a documentary about dog shows and several contestants in particular. You follow these few chosen dogs from pre-show preparations all the way to the big night where one of them is chosen best in show at the fictitious Mayflower Kennel Club. However, none of these people are real dog show enthusiasts but talent improvisational actors that parody many of the common types of people you meet in the dog show world. Amazingly, even though the characters are rather outlandish, there is a lot of truth to the personalities they are parodying--as decades ago I had some experience with dog shows and this is a VERY cutthroat group of people! My favorites of the dog owners were the incredibly high-pressure and tense yuppie couple who just exuded anger and volatility. I also loved the openly gay couple, as they were terribly funny and clever. However, the best performance probably wasn't from any of the couples but from Fred Willard who played the world's stupidest and least talented announcer in human history.

Yet, he himself does call Magnolia his masterpiece. A perfect ensemble piece. Spanning for over 3 hours, PTA manages to create a satisfying amount of screen-time and depth to all his characters; all strong characters might I add. All of them are so interesting and involving. I'm not saying with that length its a hard thing to do, but he does keep it impressively even. It's a personal experience, rich with its own personal qualities and simple elements. From the choice of music to entire flow of the film. Magnolia is exactly the kind of film I wish to accomplish, or at least, dream about making. PTA makes it look so easy, which only increases the hope (beautifully illustrated by Quiz Kid Donnie Smith's favourite song). Magnolia is full to the brim of exactly what I want. It's cinematic epicness is breath-taking upon every viewing. One of the most rewarding films ever made, which could grant it a worthy top spot. Paul Thomas Anderson deserves an award for his direction, not only of the year but for all-time. He swoops and weaves this beautiful mosaic together with his fantastic editing job. Piling on the emotion character by character, scene by scene. Tracking shoots and zooms galore fascinate me every time, grabbing my whole attention just because I want to experience it again. The vibrant colour formed a massive impression on me. It's indescribable but must be mentioned. Its so; definitive, in a sense. I'm not entirely sure how its expressed in words. Its sort of; comfort. Like a familiar room where I could just relax. No, I can't express it. Let's just say its personal perfection. Magnolia has some of the most faultless scoring of any film imaginable. From Aimee Mann's own songs to classical music to no music at all (leaving the acting to take hold of the scene &#x96; extremely effective and affective). It keeps a solid pace to the film. Making it one of the shortest 3 hour films I've ever sat through. Before now, I would have never been able to sum what Magnolia is about in a sentence. Maybe I would have said; It's about the life of these certain connected people in a day. Now; sentences are too short. Magnolia is about the relationships between parent and child of all ages, sexes and situation, and all the people that surround them. Simple acts of greed come back to haunt them. Repressed emotion is stored. Repressed emotion is wanting to be let out. Repressed emotion is let out in the wrong manner. Repressed emotion is let out at the wrong time and the wrong way. It's released, but not restored. It just destroys them. And in the end, nothing is resolved. The repressed emotion is free. My personal favourite performance of the film belongs to Tom Cruise. His transformation from his energetic and enthusiastic persona to a subtle and brittle true self, once the repressed emotion is released of course. Melora Walters' incredibly anxious performance is my second favourite performance, which I must say I respected it a lot more with this rewatch.I'm not sure whether this is new founded love or not; as Magnolia was previously my number two on my second viewing. I think, now I have gained a greater understanding and respect for the film. I have a better personal connection with the film. And that is that its my biggest inspiration in all of film. I also wouldn't have been able to squeeze a bloody paragraph of why I love Magnolia (too difficult), but for some reason, now I can. I love this film, and nobody can take it away from me. It has been jumping around my list a lot recently, but now I think its staying put. Or, it can only go higher. It now rests at #3.

Making it one of the shortest 3 hour films I've ever sat through. Before now, I would have never been able to sum what Magnolia is about in a sentence. Maybe I would have said; It's about the life of these certain connected people in a day. Now; sentences are too short. Magnolia is about the relationships between parent and child of all ages, sexes and situation, and all the people that surround them. Simple acts of greed come back to haunt them. Repressed emotion is stored. Repressed emotion is wanting to be let out. Repressed emotion is let out in the wrong manner. Repressed emotion is let out at the wrong time and the wrong way. It's released, but not restored. It just destroys them. And in the end, nothing is resolved. The repressed emotion is free. My personal favourite performance of the film belongs to Tom Cruise. His transformation from his energetic and enthusiastic persona to a subtle and brittle true self, once the repressed emotion is released of course. Melora Walters' incredibly anxious performance is my second favourite performance, which I must say I respected it a lot more with this rewatch.I'm not sure whether this is new founded love or not; as Magnolia was previously my number two on my second viewing. I think, now I have gained a greater understanding and respect for the film. I have a better personal connection with the film. And that is that its my biggest inspiration in all of film. I also wouldn't have been able to squeeze a bloody paragraph of why I love Magnolia (too difficult), but for some reason, now I can. I love this film, and nobody can take it away from me. It has been jumping around my list a lot recently, but now I think its staying put. Or, it can only go higher. It now rests at #3.

Yet, he himself does call Magnolia his masterpiece. A perfect ensemble piece. Spanning for over 3 hours, PTA manages to create a satisfying amount of screen-time and depth to all his characters; all strong characters might I add. All of them are so interesting and involving. I'm not saying with that length its a hard thing to do, but he does keep it impressively even. It's a personal experience, rich with its own personal qualities and simple elements. From the choice of music to entire flow of the film. Magnolia is exactly the kind of film I wish to accomplish, or at least, dream about making. PTA makes it look so easy, which only increases the hope (beautifully illustrated by Quiz Kid Donnie Smith's favourite song). Magnolia is full to the brim of exactly what I want. It's cinematic epicness is breath-taking upon every viewing. One of the most rewarding films ever made, which could grant it a worthy top spot. Paul Thomas Anderson deserves an award for his direction, not only of the year but for all-time. He swoops and weaves this beautiful mosaic together with his fantastic editing job. Piling on the emotion character by character, scene by scene. Tracking shoots and zooms galore fascinate me every time, grabbing my whole attention just because I want to experience it again. The vibrant colour formed a massive impression on me. It's indescribable but must be mentioned. Its so; definitive, in a sense. I'm not entirely sure how its expressed in words. Its sort of; comfort.

I like that this gives his character more of a human element, and also adds to his humanity by portraying him not as an infallible movie-hero but a very real man with needs and emotions. This is the same character that was saw in the original Die Hard, who wanted his wife to move back to New York with him and was also physically affected by his wounds throughout the course of the movie.

Immediately, my head is filling with red flags, even though I am not what you would call and airport expert. It seems that the terrorists have seized control of the electrical system of the airport, blacking out the runway so that the plans can't see to land. I know that passenger jets are designed so that an airport can take control of them and land the plane, and that the pilots don't really have to do the actual landing itself. But does that mean that the pilots are helpless in the cockpit during landing? I didn't know that, and frankly I doubt it. But then again, reporters are able to gain easy access to the airport's control tower in the movie, so clearly there are a lot of liberties taken with reality for the purposes of the plot.At any rate, John's wife is on one of the jets awaiting runway lights and permission to land, which means the bad guys are going to have a bad time with one particular guy.My biggest problem with the movie is that the premise is just so weak to me. It just seems so ridiculous to think that just a handful of people, even 20 years ago, could take over the control tower and render an entire sky full of passenger jets completely helpless.We are asked to believe that not only are the pilots helpless during landing, but also during a holding pattern. If they have no control of the plane, why do we have air traffic controllers? What is the point of talking to the pilots if the airport controls the plane anyway?But if you can believe that, then maybe it will be easier for you to accept that fully loaded passenger planes would sit in a holding pattern indefinitely until they literally run out of fuel and fall from the sky rather than diverting to a nearby airport. And it also might not seem so strange to you when one air traffic controller tells the pilots of one plane Good luck after telling them to continue their holding pattern even though they're running low on fuel. Good luck??Overall it's still a good action movie, John is still cool as hell but unfortunately the story is unimaginative and is told through generic action sequences, many of which make little to no sense. At one point, for example, a bad guy is sucked into one of the plane's engines (I would have given a spoiler warning, but you had to already know that that would happen somewhere in this movie) and doesn't damage it at all. But in the movie's defense, at least the generic action fits well with the flow of the film.

I mean, who isn't familiar with the quote, Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn? Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara are household names and the film itself is regarded as a timeless classic more than seventy years after its initial release.One part of the film's enduring appeal is its stars. Vivien Leigh, besides looking absolutely stunning, delivers a top-notch performance which won her an Oscar. Another well-deserved Oscar went to Hattie McDaniel in the Supporting Actress category. In winning that award she beat out Olivia de Havilland who turned in an excellent performance herself. Finally, let's not forget Clark Gable who received a Best Actor nomination for his efforts.The film's look is simply breathtaking, being absolutely drenched in sumptuous Technicolor. It's no wonder that the film won Oscars for cinematography & art direction, not to mention an honorary award to production designer William Cameron Menzies. Director Victor Fleming (with uncredited assistance from George Cukor and Sam Wood) deftly used this palette and wound up earning himself an Oscar. The Max Steiner score (which was nominated but lost to The Wizard of Oz) was voted by the AFI as the second best film score of all time. I wouldn't rate it quite that highly but I have to admit that the main theme is exemplary and the sheer volume of music over the film's running time is impressive.The story is compelling but I can certainly imagine today's audiences finding the nearly four hour length somewhat arduous. Another factor in the enjoyment of the story will be the sensitivity to the racial matters inherent in the source material. Personally, it didn't bother me since, while the film does romanticize the old South, it didn't strike me as suggesting that it was ethically excusable. In any case, while the plot is interesting on its own, it's the characters that really bring the movie to life. Scarlett & Rhett are of course iconic as one of the definitive screen couples but the characters of Ashley Wilkes and his wife Melanie are also fascinating.Ultimately, while the unadulterated romance of Gone With the Wind makes it a movie that is likely to appeal more to a female audience, there's no question in my mind that, whether you are male or female, this is truly an essential film. If nothing else, watch it to find out precisely why Clark Gable doesn't give a damn.

I mean, who isn't familiar with the quote, Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn? Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara are household names and the film itself is regarded as a timeless classic more than seventy years after its initial release.One part of the film's enduring appeal is its stars. Vivien Leigh, besides looking absolutely stunning, delivers a top-notch performance which won her an Oscar. Another well-deserved Oscar went to Hattie McDaniel in the Supporting Actress category. In winning that award she beat out Olivia de Havilland who turned in an excellent performance herself. Finally, let's not forget Clark Gable who received a Best Actor nomination for his efforts.The film's look is simply breathtaking, being absolutely drenched in sumptuous Technicolor. It's no wonder that the film won Oscars for cinematography & art direction, not to mention an honorary award to production designer William Cameron Menzies. Director Victor Fleming (with uncredited assistance from George Cukor and Sam Wood) deftly used this palette and wound up earning himself an Oscar. The Max Steiner score (which was nominated but lost to The Wizard of Oz) was voted by the AFI as the second best film score of all time. I wouldn't rate it quite that highly but I have to admit that the main theme is exemplary and the sheer volume of music over the film's running time is impressive.The story is compelling but I can certainly imagine today's audiences finding the nearly four hour length somewhat arduous. Another factor in the enjoyment of the story will be the sensitivity to the racial matters inherent in the source material. Personally, it didn't bother me since, while the film does romanticize the old South, it didn't strike me as suggesting that it was ethically excusable. In any case, while the plot is interesting on its own, it's the characters that really bring the movie to life.

","genre":"Drama, History, Romance"},{"date":"10 November 2008","score":"3 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":" Intended as part tongue-in-cheek comedy and part horror, Howling III is sadly neither funny nor scary. French director Philippe Mora once again calls the shots, this time transplanting the action to the outback of Australia, where a small group of half-human\/half-marsupial shape-shifters live in isolation, away from the persecution of man. However, when the beautiful Jerboa (Imogen Annesley) leaves for the big city, and falls in love with Donny, a member of a film crew, she unwittingly exposes her clan to danger...The plot to this second sequel to the original 80s horror hit is so stupid, and so far removed from the first film, that it is bound to find a small audience amongst werewolf fans keen to see just how truly bizarre and totally crap it actually is. Those that do seek the film out and watch it in its entirety will be treated to a mind-bogglingly awful (but definitely one-of-a-kind) experience, that features such dubious delights as a trio of werewolf nuns, a top horror film director who looks and acts uncannily like Hitchcock, a birth scene with a difference (the newborn crawls from between Jerboa's legs and into the furry pouch on her stomach), and a Russian ballerina transforming into a hairy monster mid-performance.Whilst all of this sounds like terrific fun for fans of cheap, trashy horror, it isn't although the whole film tries desperately to be 'so bad, it's funny', the slow delivery, dreadful acting, awful effects and cheap production values ensure that it just ends up being embarrassing to watch. Throw in a cameo from Barry 'Dame Edna' Humphries as the host of an awards show, and you have one hell of a bad film!
