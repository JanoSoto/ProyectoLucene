A movie so determined to stack the cinematic deck in favor of Adams' theories of medicine that it makes JFK look unbiased and balanced?One thing that really got me was that everyone who advised me to see this film told me that Adams, played by Robin Williams, reminded them a lot of me.

Hell, if the _real_ Adams is one-tenth that egotistical and annoying, he should apologize too. Of course, in the movie, no one finds Patch Adams egotistical and annoying, except the evil dean of the medical school, Patch's nemesis. In the movie, everyone laughs and claps and cheers at Adams\/Williams prancing around like a clown on an ego high.

And he immediately bonds with all the other mental patients and alienates the presiding doctor by starting to make fun of a catatonic patient. And the other patients join in, and the doctor gets all huffy and the meeting gets cancelled, and I think this was supposed to be some sort of fore-shadowing, showing how the unconventional Adams and his unconventional humor aren't embraced by the stuffy, _conventional_ medical system, but all I'm thinking is, what kind of jerk picks on someone who can't fight back?But even outside of Williams' ego trip as Adams, the movie was unbearable. It was so formulaic and mechanical I could almost hear the gears turn behind the screen.

Unfortunately, the Academy's long standing prejudice against animated features also extends to live-action children films. (After all, The Wizard of Oz is a much better film than GWTW.)

Cusack? look, it's Jared Leto! and did anybody else think this was just a big Calvin Klein commercial where everyone was whispering in overhead narrative. I could have sworn I heard Ben Chaplin whisper Eternity, by Calvin Klein, available wherever immortality is sold. I have to admit I walked out of Private Ryan, but that is because the images were so hyperkinetic and induced such great feelings in me, i needed to breathe. I had to walk out of thin red line too but that's cause it sucked. Terence Malick I hear is a legend but I don't think he should have come out of retirement to stuff this pretentious piece of art down our throats (much like I was disappointed with Ronin by Frankenheimer. I don't know why I listened to all these film critics who put this thing on their top ten lists but I warn you not to see this film and if you do see it please tell me I am not the only one who sees it as a bad film. Oh there is one redeeming part of the movie. the part where the bird is crawling and slowly dying, I thought that image was very poignant, But at the same time I thought what kind of sicko director would purposely injure a bird to make a movie????

Possibly because there's no real way to relate to the characters. Tom is simply a fast talking yet clever thug. The problem, though, is that he's simply a satire on past 30's and 40's crime characters. Perhaps he's too clever and too fast talking. He steps over the bounds of suspension of disbelief. I would recommend Miller's Crossing to friends because so many people tend to like it but it's not one for me. ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller"}]
