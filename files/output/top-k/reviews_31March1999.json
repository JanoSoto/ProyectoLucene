Not to worry; even if this was released during a good year for comedy, this would still be funny.  David O. Russell proves SPANKING THE MONKEY was no fluke with this movie, which may push the bad taste envelope, but unlike others (are you listening Bobby and Peter Farrelly?), knows bad taste alone does not a movie make.  You also need humor and people to care about, and this movie provides it in spades.  There are so many genuinely funny scenes here it's hard to list them all, but my favorite would probably be when the FBI agent played by Richard Jenkins is accidently given LSD and takes a trip he never expected.Ben Stiller and Patricia Arquette are the two leads here, and they do fine work, but the real treat is the supporting cast.  You might just dismiss the casting of Mary Tyler Moore and George Segal as Stiller's adoptive parents, and Alan Alda and Lily Tomlin as Stiller's real parents as just stunt casting, but they go beyond that to be funny.  Moore is especially good as a pushy mom, being 180 degrees away from her TV image.  Tea Leoni is probably best known for a lousy TV sitcom, but she proved she had genuine comedic talent here as Tina, the adoption agency worker.  As one critic up here pointed out, what makes Tina funny is (1) she's tall, (2) she's clumsy, and (3) she has no sense of humor about either of those traits.  And what makes it work is she isn't self-conscious at all, but throws herself right into the character.  And finally, Jenkins is quite a surprise; though he's a good character actor, I had no idea he was this funny.  All in all, hysterical!

It's an elegiac view of the nature of friendship that Zonca's filmmaking juices up in a fresh way. The film's two friends, Isa and Marie, meet at their McJobs as seamstresses and become friends haphazardly, without real connection or emotion. As they strive to survive - sometimes with urgency, more often with ennui - small dependencies form between them. At first, Isa lives out of Marie's hand for the simple necessities of food and shelter, but eventually it is Isa who gets a grip on the situation and tries to sustain Marie through the emotional turmoil of her life. It's not the storied stuff of soulmates finding their missing halves, but it has the feel of actuality, a much more hard-won narrative achievement.Isa a definitive performance by Elodie Bouchez, who we may barely recognize from Andre Techine's attentive study Wild Reeds and Yolande Zauberman's bleak Clubbed to Death is the one with the history and experience of the road behind her. With her pack on her back, she looks toughened but not defeated. She seems to have taken the road's lessons well and it gives her a spiritual beauty that radiates through her chopped hair and scrubbed face. Marie Natacha Regnier has never left wet, grey Lille and has barely thought about doing anything about that fact. She has a soft physical beauty she does not recognize or care about. We don't know what she cares about. Life has shrugged her off so far and she is no aptitude or inclination to fight back - it has only taught her to hide. She's not an innocent but she has only a scattershot anger in her defensive arsenal, an anger that she turns on the world, on Isa and eventually on herself. She reminds me so much of Vincent Gallo's Billy in Buffalo '66.Marie is housesitting a flat for a mother and daughter who are in the hospital after a car accident. This is a mere detail to Marie - she has no curiosity about them or their fate. It's just a housesit to her. Isa finds the young daughter Sandrine's journal and while reading through it, finds herself becoming closer and closer to her as she and Marie slowly drift apart. She finally goes to the hospital to visit the friend she was never met and finds Sandrine lying comatose. There's really nothing Isa can do for her. They have nothing between them except what Isa understands about Sandrine from this journal. Yet, we know there is more than that superficiality that connects them. Sandrine and Isa are lost girls, just as Isa and Marie are a different kind of lost girls. It comes to Isa to continue the journal for Sandrine&#133;and for herself. It is the film's spare gesture of hope.While Isa fights the existential battle to stay afloat and improve her lot bit by tiny bit, Marie's life begins to crumble - first, at the edges and then wholesale. She just drifts without a plan. Her anger is her keel through the employment world. Accidentally, she meets the spoiled Chris one of my favorite young actors, Gregoire Colin, a careless big fish is this Lille pond. It's obvious to Isa and to us that he is just going to use her up and toss her aside, but Marie's infatuation is blind to this reality. Marie should know better. Initially, she does know better. But she can't resist Chris. Charly, her menacingly large but sensitive other man, shows her a kinder face of love but Marie or any of us for that matter can't help herself. You can't resist it - The Other who makes your heart beat faster. It's the kind of love we hope is saving&#133;but often is not.It's a fascinating portrayal of a friendship's beginning, its growth and its end. There is something unmistakable French about it and, at the same time, unFrench. It's full of space; its pacing is devoid of the rhythm of American films and is opaque in that patented French way. But we are drawn in too - we are not just observers here. It's beautifully shot by Agnes Godard, Claire Denis's cinematographer on I Can't Sleep and Nenette and Boni among others. Her camera is so alive; she has the knack of capturing the interior quality of a character as well as anyone I can think of. I think it's in how she lights the scenes. Her films are subtly bright but still natural maybe only a stop or a stop-and-a-half over - so evenly lit that there is hardly a shadow, and certainly no dark places to hide. Zonca and the actors must know that every nuance is being recorded and that they have no choice but to find their character's souls in the frame. It's a stunning achievement for a first film.

The camp is run by Colonel Saito, played by Sessue Hayakowa, a part-time artist and wine connoisseur, and full-time prison warden and sadist.  Colonel Saito tells his captives, members of the Royal Armed Corps of Engineers, that they must build a rail bridge over the Kwai River, or be executed without honor.  He also orders the officers of the corps, led by Colonel Nicholson, played by Sir Alec Guiness, to assist in the manual labor.  Colonel Nicholson resists, citing a book of the rules of warfare written by the League of Nations forbiding captured officers to serve manual labor.  In honorable protest, they stand at full attention in a hunger strike for a full 24 hours until Colonel Saito relents.Colonel Nicholson goes to the construction site and realizes that the bridge should be built on more solid ground further downstream.  He convinces Colonel Saito that they should build in another site.  If his men are being forced to work, Nicholson argues, they will work to build the best possible construction.  During the second construction, an American soldier Shears escapes the camp and ends up in Ceylon, a British Territory at the time. His British liberators use him and his knowledge of the project, and they assemble a small team to go back to the bridge to destroy it.And therein lies the conflict.  In most movies, there is a person or group that you can root for without conviction, like the Americans in Saving Private Ryan.  If you root for Shears and his team, they are destroying something that their countrymen slaved hard labor to build.  Rooting for Nicholson means you are upholding the Japanese in their goal of expansion. Even Saito, although very brutal, is honorable.  He fights and does what he does for his country, not his own glory.  Honor is usually a virtue, but here it is a fatal flaw.  The pointlessness of war becomes completely apparent.  Pardon the cliche, but there are no winners in this movie, or in war, just degrees of losing.  Two points drive this home.  The first is Shears's exclaimation ...you're all worrying about the proper way to die, when you should be worrying about the proper way to live!  The second is after the bridge is completed, Colonel Nicholson gives a final lookover and sets a placard on the bridge that states that although it is under a Japanese flag, it was build by the hard work of the Royal Armed Corps of Engineers.  The final end sequence is totally gripping, and one that you will never forget.This movie won 7 Oscars, and it deserved every one.  Every element, the plot, acting, characterization, editing, is stunning.  The cinematography of the jungle and the bridge itself is among the best ever, and is a real treat in widescreen.  It's 245 running time will amaze you when you realize it after you are over, because it doesn't seem the least bit overlong.  Even the visual effects do not seem dated, and it was made over 40 years ago. I don't give out 10's very often, but this movie more than earns it.

The camp is run by Colonel Saito, played by Sessue Hayakowa, a part-time artist and wine connoisseur, and full-time prison warden and sadist.  Colonel Saito tells his captives, members of the Royal Armed Corps of Engineers, that they must build a rail bridge over the Kwai River, or be executed without honor.  He also orders the officers of the corps, led by Colonel Nicholson, played by Sir Alec Guiness, to assist in the manual labor.  Colonel Nicholson resists, citing a book of the rules of warfare written by the League of Nations forbiding captured officers to serve manual labor.  In honorable protest, they stand at full attention in a hunger strike for a full 24 hours until Colonel Saito relents.Colonel Nicholson goes to the construction site and realizes that the bridge should be built on more solid ground further downstream.  He convinces Colonel Saito that they should build in another site.  If his men are being forced to work, Nicholson argues, they will work to build the best possible construction.  During the second construction, an American soldier Shears escapes the camp and ends up in Ceylon, a British Territory at the time. His British liberators use him and his knowledge of the project, and they assemble a small team to go back to the bridge to destroy it.And therein lies the conflict.  In most movies, there is a person or group that you can root for without conviction, like the Americans in Saving Private Ryan.  If you root for Shears and his team, they are destroying something that their countrymen slaved hard labor to build.  Rooting for Nicholson means you are upholding the Japanese in their goal of expansion. Even Saito, although very brutal, is honorable.  He fights and does what he does for his country, not his own glory.  Honor is usually a virtue, but here it is a fatal flaw.  The pointlessness of war becomes completely apparent.  Pardon the cliche, but there are no winners in this movie, or in war, just degrees of losing.  Two points drive this home.  The first is Shears's exclaimation ...you're all worrying about the proper way to die, when you should be worrying about the proper way to live!  The second is after the bridge is completed, Colonel Nicholson gives a final lookover and sets a placard on the bridge that states that although it is under a Japanese flag, it was build by the hard work of the Royal Armed Corps of Engineers.  The final end sequence is totally gripping, and one that you will never forget.This movie won 7 Oscars, and it deserved every one.  Every element, the plot, acting, characterization, editing, is stunning.  The cinematography of the jungle and the bridge itself is among the best ever, and is a real treat in widescreen.  It's 245 running time will amaze you when you realize it after you are over, because it doesn't seem the least bit overlong.  Even the visual effects do not seem dated, and it was made over 40 years ago. I don't give out 10's very often, but this movie more than earns it.

At first I thought, well, maybe I'll watch a few minutes of it- it's so depressing but I feel like watching a good movie for a change.  I hadn't seen this picture in several years since it was released. The first time I saw the film, in the theater, I went with my parents and was somewhat in denial.  I tried to block out the pain that was before me and retain my composure.  After realizing its brilliance, I tried to forget the film.  It certainly wasn't something to dwell on.This time when I watched the film I really surprised myself.  I sat and cried like I haven't in years- but that's a good thing.  I've been so divorced from my feelings and so wrapped up in my own selfish hell that I forgot what life is capable of becoming.Now, Spielberg himself has admitted that he tends to over-sentimentalize things.  Take the scene when Stern has just been rescued from the train by Schindler and as the two men walk away the camera pans to a large room where the suitcases of  countless other souls less fortunate are being trifled through; a  pile of personal photographs of  family lay strewn amidst wasted boots and eye glasses.  That scene destroyed me with emotion yet it was something that actually happened.I will admit that towards the end, when Schindler was going on about how he could have sold his car to save more lives or sold his pin- even on second inspection, that scene seems rather forced- even enough for Jerry Seinfeld to mock.  I was kind of mad at Spielberg.  I mean, doesn't he know when to back off.  It seems with an absolute masterpiece like this film, he would have been more careful and edited out this truly sentimental passage with violins going haywire.Regardless, I'm in awe of this picture and with his latest- Saving Private Ryan, I do think that Spielberg is truly one of, if not, the greatest directors of film ever.

Not being a fan of family films, I saw this mainly because my favorite critic, Anthony Lane of The New Yorker magazine, gave it a rave review, and I was glad I went.  I've seen two of Carroll Ballard's films, THE BLACK STALLION and NEVER CRY WOLF. The latter was somewhat disappointing, but FLY AWAY HOME is as good as THE BLACK STALLION.  This is the rare children's film which doesn't talk down to kids, indulge in stupid humor, or push bloated values on them.  Instead, Ballard takes his cue from the grace of the geese and the unique, natural ability of his lead actress, Anna Paquin.

I've seen two of Carroll Ballard's films, THE BLACK STALLION and NEVER CRY WOLF. The latter was somewhat disappointing, but FLY AWAY HOME is as good as THE BLACK STALLION.  This is the rare children's film which doesn't talk down to kids, indulge in stupid humor, or push bloated values on them.  Instead, Ballard takes his cue from the grace of the geese and the unique, natural ability of his lead actress, Anna Paquin.

","genre":"Adventure, Drama, Family"},{"date":"31 March 1999","score":"","review":"  Following the tradition of the Punisher, the Crow, Darkman...Spawn is another movie about a man, being killed by gangsters or crime-lords, who comes back for revenge after being saved in this case by Malebolgia, Lord of Hell. The same old recycled story. So why would you spend your hard earned dollars to see this movie? Well, this movie has some highlights. First there is the great pre-credits opening. That segment is very original and could have been an opening for a James Bond movie. They have of course more money to develop this opening but the Spawn opening could have been a good rough cut. Another great scene is the transformation of the Clown into the Violator. The whole Violator segment has quite a horrific tension. The transformation of Spawn during the whole course of the movie is very convincing, you could believe that he has been build by necroplasm. Melinda Clark is not only very beautiful but terrific over the top as the assassin Jessica Priest. I do not understand why they killed her in the first half of the movie. The tension between her and Spawn could have pulled this movie to another level rather than sticking with Martin Sheen as the dull unconvincing crime-lord. His acting is as stiff as the make-up on his face. On the other hand this movie has some serious failures. There is absolutely no development of caracter. They are as flat as a piece of paper. Their dialogue comes directly from the comic-book. The acting is as wooden as my front door. The SFX of  Hell, Malebolgia and the final confrontation scene is the worst I have ever seen. Totally unconvincing, even childish. The story has no tension or build up at all. In fact you are watching a feature music-video without any music. Last but not least the character of the Clown is so annoying that you have to have a real good stomach to swallow his crap. Knowing Todd McFarlaine from his comic book back ground, I can not understand that he, as producer, agreed to go ahead with this movie. He, who is always proud to master and control all levels of product development that leaves his production firm, you only have to look at his great toy-line, should have known better. He should have raised more money to develop this movie and deliver a better product. Hopefully the sequel will be better. Hopefully!
