[{"date":"18 November 2008","score":"","review":" Someone noted earlier that the book that Kathryn carries to the restaurant to help NY152 identify her is Austen's *Pride and Prejudice*, a good observation that suggested the parallels between the female and male characters in Pride and Prejudice and those in You've Got Mail. An interesting side note is that in the original movie with James Stewart and Ms. Sullivan, the book in this scene was Tolstoy's *Anna Karenina*. I think that prop change in the later movie is significant commentary on the screenwriters' differing perspectives in these respective movies. In spite of its capitalistic capitulating, You've Got Mail is a very sunny tale compared to The Shop around the Corner, which contains subplots of betrayal of coworkers, betrayal of spouses, jealousy, suspicion, and suicide. Likewise, Austen's novel, a satire of manners, is a sunny tale compared to Tolstoy's epic of betrayal, unhappiness, and ultimate suicide.

And sure enough... I liked it. Sure, there were more then a few strange holes in the plot. And sure, you won't be seeing any Oscar-worthy performances. But I enjoyed it nonetheless goddammit! Sometimes you just have to watch a movie without overanalysing it and just enjoy the ride. I guess one of the things you could get hung up on is the fact that the whole set-up for the movie depends on the fact whether a mob-boss chooses to get in a car with a gang of youngsters he's never seen before to join for dinner with one of their fathers. A bit hard to swallow I'll admit. But hey, if you accept that someone could acquire superpowers by getting bitten by a radioactive spider this is a small leap of faith. Anyway, there are more of these strange irregularities in the script but I'll take a few strange coincidences for the sake of a good movie. What I'm having a harder time dealing with is the strange tone. It's like the director couldn't make up his mind whether to make it a dark comedy or a thriller\/gangster film. Now it just sort of stumbles in between. A shame really, because it is a great set up with a rather unusual hostage situation where the hostage gradually takes control of and turns the tables on his kidnappers. In the right hands this could have been a fantastic movie instead of just a good one.6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"18 November 2008","score":"5 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" I admit I only saw this movie because it starred Christopher Walken and I figured it would at least be worth the time.
