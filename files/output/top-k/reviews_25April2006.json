I ended up absolutely loving it! Anyway, I did not understand something that Drugs said. He was asking Dunph if Bunny Cote ever went out on dates and then after Dunph replied, Drugs stated that he goes to the movies by himself. I don't understand why he said that or how that related to the scene. Even though I don't understand what he meant, it really broke my heart when he said that. He was my favorite character and it was just TERRIBLE that he died in the film!!! If anyone could tell me what he meant by that, my understanding of the movie would be greatly improved. Thank you very much!!!
