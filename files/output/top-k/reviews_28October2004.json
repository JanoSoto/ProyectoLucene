Yes, the successes of films like 'Silence of the Lambs' and 'Se7ven' has saddled us up with an endless series of lame wannabes. A quenched FBI officer (Spader) moves from LA to Chicago after being unable to solve a serial-killer case. The killer (Reeves) follows him and continues his uncanny hobby there. He sends Spader and his new team of coppers a picture of his next target and then gives them until 9pm sharp to prevent her from getting killed. This modus operandi is repeated a couple of times which is quite dull. Although 'The Watcher' features quite a lot of action sequences, there's almost no tension. Instead of tension, we get irritating MTV-style flashbacks and lousy references to Reeves' previous blockbuster 'The Matrix'. The overwhelming music by Marco Beltrami doesn't exactly increase the tension level, neither. On the contrary, I'd say&#133;. The acting is below average. It clearly shows that Reeves didn't really want this project and Marisa Tomei (as Spader's shrink) is wasted. The Watcher was the very first project of unknown director Joe Charbanic but I'm not really anticipating any further work of his.

Originally, the decision to shoot the film in black and white was based specifically on cinematographer Michael Chapman and Martin Scorsese's memories of 1940's boxing bouts, which they remembered as black and white flash photos in magazines. People's memories of Jake La Motta's fights would have been black and white ones and therefore it seemed right to shoot in black and white, even though at first they had fears this would be seen as too pretentious. The particular visual intensity of the fight scenes, however, was partly due to financial difficulties rather than directorial choices. In an attempt to keep the picture on schedule, two separate lighting styles had to be adopted. Jake's life outside the ring would be kept as simple as possible, and this meant that the scenes in the ring could be concentrated on more. They would be shot entirely in the Los Angeles studio and would be highly stylised. This is how the dazzling visual nature of the fight scenes was allowed to come about. Scorsese, suffering from a low point in his career, was convinced this film would be his last and wanted to go out with a bang. Hence he decided to give the fighting scenes all he could, since he had nothing to lose anymore.What Scorsese disliked about the previous boxing films he had seen was the way the fights were shown from ringside, adopting a spectator's view, which protected the audience from the brutality inside the ring. For Raging Bull, Scorsese was determined to get as close as possible to the raw violence of the fights. He would film inside the ring and make the audience feel every punch. His plan was to shoot the fight scenes as if the viewers were the fighter, and their impressions were the fighter's, and never to insulate the audience from the violence in the ring. The viewers would think, feel, see and hear everything the boxers would. Aside from the opening fight, La Motta's first professional defeat against Jimmy Reeves, there would be no cuts to the baying of the crowd. For the Reeves fight Scorsese chose to include some chaotic backlash from the crowd showing their disapproval of the judge's decision, but apart from this scene, Scorsese's mantra throughout the film was 'Stay in the ring'. Each intricately choreographed fight would have a different style in order to reflect La Motta's different states of mind at the time of the fights. Jake La Motta was consultant for the film, and the fights were depicted as he remembered them. For example, in his second fight against Sugar Ray Robinson, the ring is wide and brightened by the radiant white of the canvas making the scene feel free and open, and a relatively comfortable atmosphere. This is because La Motta won this fight, a great victory against his great rival. In contrast to this, the ring in his next fight against Robinson, which he lost on a controversial decision, was designed by Scorsese as a 'pit of hell'. In the opening shot of this fight, Scorsese has made everything look unclear and indistinguishable. This time, the ring is very dark and smoky which increases the blurred, unfocused feel of the fight. Often during this fight, faces are out of frame. For example when the two men are boxing La Motta's face is often blurred out by smoke or hidden by his opponent's body. This is seen once again when he is in his corner for the break in between the rounds; the shot has his face completely covered by one of the ropes of the ring. This was how La Motta himself remembered it; these events will remain unclear in his mind since he could not work out why he had lost. This sequence depicts a particularly upsetting part of La Motta's memories, and perfectly illustrates how he was feeling at the moment of the fight.Just as important as the look of the film was the sound. As with the cinematography, two different styles were adopted to differentiate between La Motta's life in and out of the ring. The fight scenes were recorded in Dolby Stereo with heightened, often animalistic sound effects and a striking use of silence. This contrast with the dialogue in the film, which was recorded normally, was used to emphasise La Motta's heightened sense of awareness in the ring. The most memorable use of sound in the film, in particular the use of silence, is in La Motta's fourth fight against his great rival Sugar Ray Robinson. The rounds are punctuated by eery silence, giving an impression of slow motion and evoking the idea of what would be running through the boxers' heads. Just as memorable was the decision to use an animal's breathing for Robinson's final attack on La Motta. Everything is standing still, there is a striking silence throughout and all that can be heard is the bestial breathing building the suspense, as if Robinson was a lion about to strike on its prey. The next sequence is an extremely fast montage of cuts showing La Motta being badly beaten by Robinson. This scene moves between Robinson and La Motta at a rapid pace to suit the lightning fast boxing of which La Motta is on the receiving hand. This was carefully planned out and storyboarded beforehand by Scorsese and then skilfully brought to life by editor Thelma Schoonmaker, who won an Oscar for her work.

Jack Benny plays his role with just the right amount of exaggeration for it to work perfectly, and he, Carole Lombard, and the rest of the cast help Ernst Lubitsch to tell a lively yet worthwhile tale. There are a few slow spots early in the movie, but after it hits its stride, everything fits together well.Very few film-makers can make something like this succeed, because they take themselves too seriously. Lubitsch does not, and as a result this film provides a caricatured but relatively insightful portrayal of the Nazis, with a light-hearted yet appreciative look at those who opposed them in the occupied countries. The right kind of lighter touch can sometimes be more effective in commenting on important issues than the heavy, emotionally laden harangues that are all too common.While providing good entertainment, this movie also brings out the Nazis' inherent insecurity, pettiness, and short-sightedness, while also demonstrating their growing capacity for destroying the innocent. For example, the wonderful character actor Sig Ruman is greatly entertaining as a Nazi bureaucrat, yet he also cleverly brings out the pathetic side of such persons.Aside from a couple of good gags, it starts off just a little slowly. A lot of time is spent on Robert Stack's character, who is (through no fault of Stack's) not very interesting. Likewise, the subplot involving him and Lombard takes up a lot more time than it was worth. Other than that, though, it moves briskly, with many entertaining scenes while it develops the story.

Even his teen melodrama debut, Foxes, which probably influenced quite a bit of trashy US TV.The only thing I don't like about him is that he seems a bit too influenced by soft-porn, which he thinks becomes all arty if he photographs it in natural light!Before viewing this I thought this was going to another wages-of-sin epic and came with a heavy heart, but I was quietly surprised. The handling of the production and the quality of the acting kept me on-board and asking questions to the very end. A bit of over melodramatic it may be, but very - in outline principle - believable. Richard Gere is actually not that great an actor, but he is ageing well. He looks as good as ever with a bit of grey and glasses, an improvement even. But sadly I have never seen him be great in anything - although he was good in the mostly unseen Days of Heaven.Here he gives us another of his keep-it-all-inside performances.I had to decide whether to write a spoiler review or a non spoiler review. I normally only like to do non-spoiler reviews unless there is something important that I want to say.

The argument became moot when that movie was sold out and Under Siege was playing at the right time for us to buy tickets and go on in.Two hours or so later, I was incredibly impressed. Yes, this is a formulaic movie, but so what? What's wrong with a movie that takes a reasonably clever premise (a U.S. warship is taken over by a grab-bag of ex-CIA agents, mercenaries, turncoats, and apparently a joint Swedish-Italian-North Korean submarine battalion; problem is, there's one guy on board who can beat them almost single-handedly) and provides twists and turns from beginning to end? This is a well-constructed film, something many critics and even fans don't really seem to recognize. For example, there is a scene where the good guys are able to ruin a system the bad guys want to use, and that leads into a situation where the bad guys have to unveil another system--and then one of the bad guys fixes the first system, and that leads to the good buys being able to pull a HUGE surprise on them!I wouldn't say the story here is plausible, but it allows for the willing suspension of disbelief, and fit in well with the time frame of 1992--when the Cold War was over, but it wasn't clear what would become of the U.S. military and intelligence bodies, so this film kind of considered that on a very light surface level before plunging into the action.There are some things about Under Siege that don't work. Ereka Eleniak's character has such poor dialogue and is so out of place that even a good actress would have been stymied in dealing with her, and her role in a showdown between Rayback and Colm Meaney's Dauber is completely unbelievable The only other plot points that had me just saying oh come on now involved two helicopters and dealing with a very unpleasant missile's flight path; I won't go into more detail because spoilers aren't my base of interest.Bottom line is that I saw that movie in regular theaters, then saw it again at a second-run theatre (there seemed to be a lot more of those 12 years ago) then rented it, watched it several times on HBO and have recently watched it about five more times on the STARZ!

I have to say, I was pretty disappointed. I mean, I'm supposed to feel sorry for this guy? He's shamelessly sleeping with two women at the same time, and getting tripped out on LSD. What do I care if he gets out of his mess? He's not a good guy, in spite of the fact that the movie half-heartedly attempts to make him seem so, since he is trying to get money together for his parents to replace their home, which got blown away by a tornado. Here's a quick summary This guy is going to Harvard, and plays basketball for them. He is sleeping with SMG's character, whose father is a big time mobster. He is also sleeping with Joey Lauren Adams' character, who happens to be one of his teachers. His parent's home gets blown away by a tornado. He wants to help them replace it, so he asks SMG to ask her father for the money. She says he can have the money if he promises to fix a basketball game that has been bet on, so even more money can be won. The FBI gets wind of this, and try to cause a lot of trouble for SMG and her father. They attempt to get this guy to turn them in. The FBI team (a boy and a girl who his other girlfriend happens to be having regular threesomes with) let his other girlfriend know what's going on, and she tries to get him out of it. While all this chaos is going on, this guy is totally tripped out on LSD, hearing voices, hallucinating, etc. Pretty ridiculous. So, basically, my main problem with this movie was that I didn't like any of these characters. None of them seemed like good people, like anyone that I would care much one way or the other what happened to them. No sympathy for anyone. So, I was actually sitting through the whole movie, hoping it would be over soon because I was tired of watching it. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. The only good point I thought Sarah Michelle Gellar did a good job with her part. She was very believable. I didn't think of her as Buffy once during this movie.

This is a classic coming of age movie that includes drama and adventure. It is about four young friends; Gordie, Chris, Teddy, and Vern, played by River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, Wil Wheaton, and Jerry O'Connell, who set out to find the body of a missing teenager. Yet, this adventure turned out to be much more than a search for a body, but a search for their personal identities and the true meaning of friendship. What they found out about themselves along the way meant so much more than the teen's dead body.This movie seems to portray the typical relationships young boys have. They tease and torment one another, yet when it really matters they have each other's backs. Their wild expedition is reminiscent of those my friends and I would go on when I was a kid. It seems to be as much about exploring the outside world as much as yourself. It also reveals the fact that friends may come and go throughout a lifetime and the different paths they may take once older. This film is relevant to everyone no matter what age, race, or gender. It is extremely worthy of its Academy Award nomination.

If he wanted to impress us why didn't he learn to play the clarinet for New York\/New York rather than mime to someone else's work?

(Am I being too harsh here - do you think that he is more than a dabbler?)Mafia men have money, girls and smart suits. They don't appear to work much and yet everybody bows-and-scrapes to them. Then they wrap their expensive cloth around the shoulders of our junior hero and say hey, don't follow me, this isn't the life for you. Don't let me be your hero. Or words to that effect.
