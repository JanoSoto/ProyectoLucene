I am certain I have seen pieces of it over the years but simply never sat down to watch it. What a moving and deeply dark piece of early horror cinema. I know that Frankenstein, the story has always been heralded for having a very deep empathetic emotion for this monster out of its element and trying to survive and find its place but what surprised me is that this film from the thirties actually captures that sensitive, powerful emotion. Unlike Dracula from the same time Frankenstein is not campy or rely on cheesy special effects. The effects are solid, in fact I think even stand up today when you look at them. The work put into this film was clearly intensive and because of that it is still a classic 7 decades later. There are some good performances followed but an astounding performance in the role of the monster.I will start with that role played by Boris Karloff. He has been stereotyped in this role as the monster but I had no idea he did it so brilliantly well. He does not speak a single word and yet gives such a powerful, deeply moving performance. He is frightening and yet you will feel for him. Colin Clive is our Dr. Frankenstein. He certainly plays the mad scientist role well and the chemistry with Karloff is good. Mae Clarke is good although she doesn't have a lot of reason to be in the film other than the woman that keeps Frankenstein grounded. I'm still not sure the point of the character played by John Boles. Handsome guy but pointless to the film and yet has significant screen time. Really enjoyed the small role by Frederick Kerr as Clive's father. He was a great comic relief but done well with taste to the overall feel for the story.Director James Whale told this story so well, especially give its time. The run time is relatively short and yet he manages to take the story and bring to it every aspect you would expect from the novel. The dark gritty setting of the tower and the village all make for a powerful looking film. Obviously a film so old shows its age and it would be impossible not to see the flaws but for a film like this and for its time it is just really wonderful to watch. If you have not seen this and you love classic film you'll depriving yourself of one of the greats. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"1 November 2012","score":"","review":" I had the great pleasure for seeing this film for what I am sure was the first time ever on the big screen yesterday on Halloween.

I had never heard of this movie before and thought it would be just another mediocre movie from the 1940's, but I was wrong. Mildred Pierce portrays women in a completely different way. It shows how powerful and independent a woman can be, and that if she really wants something she will get it. Mildred does not let a cheating husband and a broken heart stop here; she is determined to do what it takes for her girls. The acting is phenomenal in this film; no one breaks character; not even for a second. Joan Crawford does an excellent job playing the strong, independent, loyal mother, Ann Blyth does an outstanding job portraying a stuck up spoiled snob, and Jack Carson never breaks the role of the upbeat and self-concerned Wally. On top of great acting the movie holds a story that keeps the audience very interested by having a few small stories inter locking with each other. The use of flashbacks also works very well with this film and helps the audience understand what is going on. The ending was by far the best part, giving you the oh my god no way feelings, although I had a feeling things would end up the way they did. There was not one moment of the film that I caught myself getting bored; I truly think it was a very fascinating film.

He plays not only the mummy, but also the human-like Imhotep revived, who interacts with the various British Egyptologists as a man. When I was around 12 years of age, my grandmother (with whom I lived) went off one dark and stormy night (yes, really) to babysit, and I stayed home and watched this film on television. It was the only time that a horror film every truly scared me.I am adding a paragraph here from my original review to comment on the recent Blu Ray edition. Is it worth the upgrade? Yes, I think it is. It's an excellent print. There is some footage taken in Egypt -- probably old documentary stuff -- that is not so clear, but all the footage of the film itself is in remarkably good condition considering it dates to 1932. The story involves the son of an ancient Egyptian king named Imhotep (Karloff), who is resurrected during an archaeological expedition led by a Brit -- actor Arthur Byron. Naturally, there's a curse on opening things found in the mummy's tomb, but one of the expedition's assistants gives into temptation and is immediately driven mad. Once alive again (after having been mummified while alive as punishment), Imhotep escapes after taking the Scroll of Thoth, with the intent of reincarnating his ancient lover. A decade later, the human Imhotep assists another expedition in finding his lover's tomb, but Imhotep becomes enthralled with the half white\/half-Egyptian wife of a Western official, who strongly resembles his old lover. She, indeed, is drawn to him. He decides to kill her and then bring his old lover back to life through the woman's corpse. Of course, he is thwarted, but not before unleashing a reign of terror.Karloff is good here...in an early-1930s sort of way. The rest of the actors do their jobs, but certainly don't stand out. The one exception I would make was Arthur Byron, who was quite good as the older Egyptologist. The sets are believable. I have 3 criticisms. The lead actress -- Zita Johann -- is...well...very early 1930ish. She was active only for about 3 years...and I think it's obvious why. Oh, she doesn't ruin the film. I just don't think she's very interesting. The special effects at the very end are disappointing. In fact, my third criticism is the climax, which is a bit of a let down. Nevertheless, I recommend this film. Having not seen it in years, I had forgotten how good it was. It's nice to see such a good print that allows one to really enjoy the film, rather than the old beat-up prints we used to see on late night television back in the 1950s-1960s.

As a life-long fan of the Caped Crusader, I have to say that if you want the real Batman, look no further. You found him.There is a certain kind of magic to Batman that no other film adaptation has been able to successfully match. The main difference between Chris Nolan's more recent Dark Knight trilogy, and Burton's 1989 version, is the visual style. The main difference is a place they call Gotham City.Tim Burton is known for many things, but above all else, it is his bizarre visual eye, a gift that works wonders in Batman. This film looks incredible! Burton creates a Gotham City that the viewer can get lost in. As opposed to Chris Nolan's outings, Tim Burton gives us a Gothic Fantasy of the highest order. Every visual element in this film is perfect; Gotham, the Batmobile, Joker, Batman himself, green ooze-- all of it. Nolan had a way of probing deep into the psyche of his characters, he seems to be a very psychological filmmaker, and he came to with fantastic results. Nolan was obviously interested in different aspects of the Dark Knight than what Tim Burton was drawn to. That makes for two very good and very different films. But the 1989 version reigns best of them all. Tim Burton gave us a work of Pop Art, a visual feast. A masterwork of the highest caliber. Tim Burton gave us a classic. Although his characters were not as moving as Nolan's would be, and the plot was not as complex as later adaptations would prove the Caped Crusader capable of, the film was pitch-perfect, ages incredibly well, and knows what it is. A comic book movie. And what does Tim Burton do with his comic book movie? He elevates the medium of film. Yes.

This film looks incredible! Burton creates a Gotham City that the viewer can get lost in. As opposed to Chris Nolan's outings, Tim Burton gives us a Gothic Fantasy of the highest order. Every visual element in this film is perfect; Gotham, the Batmobile, Joker, Batman himself, green ooze-- all of it. Nolan had a way of probing deep into the psyche of his characters, he seems to be a very psychological filmmaker, and he came to with fantastic results. Nolan was obviously interested in different aspects of the Dark Knight than what Tim Burton was drawn to. That makes for two very good and very different films. But the 1989 version reigns best of them all. Tim Burton gave us a work of Pop Art, a visual feast. A masterwork of the highest caliber. Tim Burton gave us a classic. Although his characters were not as moving as Nolan's would be, and the plot was not as complex as later adaptations would prove the Caped Crusader capable of, the film was pitch-perfect, ages incredibly well, and knows what it is.

I think Francis Ford Coppola put a little more effort into his version of Bram Stoker's Dracula than what he put into his adaptation of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.First the deviations from the novel 1. The creature In the original novel he had long black hair and did not speak like a Stroke victim. He was actually hyper intelligent and learned exceedingly fast. He was very articulate, perhaps more so than his creator and quoted things like Paradise Lost. In the novel he did not sound like a stroke victim.2. Elizabeth's heart was not ripped out in the novel. She was strangled.3. Elizabeth was never brought back in the style of the Frankenstein creature in the novel. For many this is the point where the film jumps the shark.4. I don't like that this film leaves out the secondary moral of the story. The first moral is always remembered in films that one should not tamper in God's territory, that we should not mess with nature. But what many films forget is the secondary moral, that like a child who had been neglected by a parent the creature had to learn to forgive and that revenge would bring him no peace. I don't know why so many films leave this aspect out.If you want a version of Frankenstein that actually follows Mary Shelley's novel check out the version produced by Hallmark and released to DVD by Lion's Gate starring Luke Goss as the creature. That mini-series version of Frankenstein from 2004 is the most faithful to the book and has (in my opinion) the most sympathetic version of the creature.Now, aside from straying from the novel I will not deny this is a good film, even if some moments are rather hammy and feel as if they were created specifically for the film. This is still an enjoyable movie and does retain the basic ideas behind Mary Shelley's novel. This is a good film with many good actors and special effects that hold up well after nearly twenty years. It's a timeless story and when done correctly the film adaptation is ageless. This was done well. This is one of my top five favorite Frankenstein movies.My favorite Frankenstein films are as follows 1. The Hallmark version of Frankenstein starring Luke Goss and released through Lion's Gate in 2004. Don't confuse it with any other Frankenstein productions from 2004. Make certain it is the version with Luke Goss as the creature if you choose to watch it.2. The Bride from 1984. Not to be confused with the more well known Bride of Frankenstein this one starred Sting as Baron Frankenstein and Clancy Brown as the creature. This one is a guilty pleasure for me because even though it is cheesy (and very Hammer-esque) it is one of the only versions to have a happy ending for the creature.3. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. This one is good for it's production values and for drawing attention to the original novel. It's not as faithful as it likes to boast but it is still a good movie.4. Frankenstein created woman. This is a good one released through Hammer and featuring Peter Cushing as Dr. Frankenstein. This one is cheesy but enjoyable and has all the trappings one expects from a Hammer movie.5. Frankenstein with Boris Karloff for creating the famous archetype. This 1931 Frankenstein does not follow the book but it is good film and was well made. The image of the creature in this film adaptation with his flat head, bolts in the neck, (apparently) green skin, and elevator shoes is probably the most well known and most associated with the creature even though it's nothing like what Mary Shelley described.6.

I personally felt the original film was rather slow, dull, gimmicky, and totally not scary. In spite of that, and probably because this remake falls squarely within my generation, I found this rendition of the story superior.Not only does the film update the look, style, and story, but it also updates the scares...and I still think it's pretty darn scary. The opening titles themselves are creepy, with its montage of strange and gnarly imagery and Don Davis' creepy music score. The next scene, where the lunatics literally take over the asylum, is quite intense. A few other key scenes stand out as being definitely freaky, thanks largely to the strange, twitchy, unnatural-looking nature of all the ghosts and visions the characters experience. A lot of reviewers tend to harp on the film's final act an explosive sequence in which all the ghosts pool together in a huge dark Lovecraftian mass and chases all the characters around. Most would say that these final scenes are overblown and insipid; despite such weaknesses, I always felt the big mass of ghosts was far scarier than most other things produced on film. Overall, something about the way this film reveals the ghosts, the type of imagery it uses, and the threat it emphasizes, stands out above most other ghost stories. The experience is marred just a bit by some level of cheesy acting and maybe some plot holes, but the atmosphere is effectively creepy and unnerving, and the ghosts really do freak me out.This story provides a substantial update over the original, taking the original concept and building greater depth and detail into the actual house and its ghostly occupants. There is still a twist to the plot...in fact, there are several. There are so many twists that it will require a greater suspense of disbelief. Regardless, the film is structured in a way that reveals each twist and turn without becoming too convoluted. Characters show plenty of personality; it is especially wicked to watch Geoffrey Rush, who pays some welcome homage to Vincent Price.This film is stylish and slick, with plenty of interesting and solid photography. Editing is decent. Acting can be rather silly (especially with Chris Kattan in the mix, offering a rather strange performance), but I did enjoy the cast very well. I've always had a soft spot for Geoffrey Rush and Famke Janssen in this film; Jeffrey Combs is very wicked in his role, and everybody else fulfills their parts well. Writing is not great, but distinctive and fun. This production features a lot of really stylish and interesting sets, props, and costumes.

I personally felt the original film was rather slow, dull, gimmicky, and totally not scary. In spite of that, and probably because this remake falls squarely within my generation, I found this rendition of the story superior.Not only does the film update the look, style, and story, but it also updates the scares...and I still think it's pretty darn scary. The opening titles themselves are creepy, with its montage of strange and gnarly imagery and Don Davis' creepy music score. The next scene, where the lunatics literally take over the asylum, is quite intense. A few other key scenes stand out as being definitely freaky, thanks largely to the strange, twitchy, unnatural-looking nature of all the ghosts and visions the characters experience. A lot of reviewers tend to harp on the film's final act an explosive sequence in which all the ghosts pool together in a huge dark Lovecraftian mass and chases all the characters around. Most would say that these final scenes are overblown and insipid; despite such weaknesses, I always felt the big mass of ghosts was far scarier than most other things produced on film. Overall, something about the way this film reveals the ghosts, the type of imagery it uses, and the threat it emphasizes, stands out above most other ghost stories. The experience is marred just a bit by some level of cheesy acting and maybe some plot holes, but the atmosphere is effectively creepy and unnerving, and the ghosts really do freak me out.This story provides a substantial update over the original, taking the original concept and building greater depth and detail into the actual house and its ghostly occupants. There is still a twist to the plot...in fact, there are several. There are so many twists that it will require a greater suspense of disbelief. Regardless, the film is structured in a way that reveals each twist and turn without becoming too convoluted. Characters show plenty of personality; it is especially wicked to watch Geoffrey Rush, who pays some welcome homage to Vincent Price.This film is stylish and slick, with plenty of interesting and solid photography. Editing is decent. Acting can be rather silly (especially with Chris Kattan in the mix, offering a rather strange performance), but I did enjoy the cast very well. I've always had a soft spot for Geoffrey Rush and Famke Janssen in this film; Jeffrey Combs is very wicked in his role, and everybody else fulfills their parts well. Writing is not great, but distinctive and fun. This production features a lot of really stylish and interesting sets, props, and costumes. Some of the special effects aren't aging well, but are mostly-effective. Music is quite scary.Recommended as a rental at the least.4\/5 (Entertainment Perfect | Story Pretty Good | Film Good) ","genre":"Horror, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"1 November 2012","score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Skip to number three in the series.Being the Sequel to one of the greatest horror stories ever written, Exorcist 2 sure does make sure that it follows the tradition of disappointing sequels.

It is absolutely amazing. The theme and story is just WOW! I was very happy when I first watched it, and I think I've watched 20 or more times after that. Every time I watch it, I cry like a little baby. Plus Shane West and Mandy Moore play their characters extremely well! I just can't get enough of this movie. The whole begins with a stupid little joke that turns out bad which leaves Clay Gephardt (Matt Lutz) in the hospital, and popular kid Landon Rollins Carter (Shane West) in a whole lot of trouble at school. Landon is then forced to participate in different school activities which included the drama club. While in the drama club, Landon is forced to work with Jamie Elizabeth Sullivan (Mandy Moore) who is a very shy, quiet, and book smart girl at the school. Jamie is the daughter of Rev. Hegbert Sullivan (Peter Coyote); Landon and Jamie have known each other for a while but because of their social statuses at school they have been in different spaces. Landon seeks help from Jamie when he has trouble with his lines and that is when they started to get close. Jamie was resistant in the beginning but slowly started falling for Landon. On the other hand Landon tried to hide his relationship with Jamie from his popular friends but later on when his friends disrespected Jamie, he defended her in front of the whole school. As they grew closer to each other, Jamie reveals to Landon that she is suffering from Leukemia and that she had stopped responding to the medication. Landon is upset at first but later on changes his mind, and decided to help Jamie fulfill her wish list (this is when the movie gets so good). After a while Landon and Jamie get married, and they live for a while before she passes away. Landon then goes back to see Jamie's dad, they have a little talk. Landon then leaves and is seen smiling at the sunset. The theme of this movie is love clearly. It is a very romantic movie and also sad. The theme was portrayed in a couple of scenes. The first one was when Landon defended Jamie in front of the whole school, which just showed that his love for her was strong that he was willing to confront his friends for her. The second was when he built her kaleidoscope just so she can fulfill her wish of watching a comet (extremely beautiful). This movie can be compared to the Notebook in my opinion. I personally haven't watched the movie but from what I've heard it seems like they are very similar. Lightning technique in this movie was used very well. Every time Landon and Jamie were having a beautiful moment, the light would be very bright, warm and actually peaceful. However during the rough times it would be a little bit gloomy just to match the mood.

In the first scene itself, as they are traveling in a cramped car to their destination, they encounter this mysterious force (although they do not understand what actually happens) as their car steering wheel loses control momentarily. As they cross the rickety bridge to the cabin, a plank of wood gives away under the car's weight but they somehow cross the bridge and drive to the cabin. Over there, the mysterious thing's presence is felt again as a swing outside the main door keeps striking the house until Scott opens the door. At night, Cheryl is the first unfortunate to be directly targeted by the force as it takes control of her hand while she is drawing. Later, at dinner, the moment Scott says 'party down!' the basement door opens on its own. In a funny Scooby Doo like sequence, the camera pans at each one's faces as they speak their thoughts about the incident. Scott first enters the basement with Ash following and the pair come out with a book on the dead and a tape recorder. The tape, recorded in the past by a doctor, is played and the evil spirits are beckoned. After Cheryl is raped by the forest, she demands Ash to take her out of town but the pair realizes the group's fate is doomed when they see the bridge destroyed. One by one, Cheryl and the others are possessed and it is up to Ash to do something before it is too late. The low level canting shots in Evil Dead, which were shot without using dollies (the crew couldn't afford it) made me uneasy and I was reminded of similar shots in Blair Witch Project; its marvelous how these raw effects could evoke fear while many of the sophisticated effects in recent movies cannot. Another interesting element is Raimi's focus on the eyes when the pendulum stops suddenly, a close up shot of Cheryl's frightened eyes are seen.

However, there is the tree rape scene that is much more uncomfortable since Cheryl isn't in a possessed state.

This was when I realized how my perception regarding the gory content changed when the characters transformed; it would have been much more disturbing to see a normal Linda being hacked to death. Bruce Campbell, the supporting cast and the 'fake shemps' deliver great performances for a horror movie.

A much better example is when Ash keeps a box on his lap and feigns to sleep while Linda tries to look at the contents. The camera focuses on their eyes as they play this little game of theirs. Later, when Ash is about to bury a possessed Linda, she pretends to sleep and the camera again focuses on their eyes, thus depicting the irony and difference in the situation. The gore in the film is plenteous, but it isn't very disturbing as most of the blood comes from the zombies. However, there is the tree rape scene that is much more uncomfortable since Cheryl isn't in a possessed state. This reminds me of another scene in the movie just when Ash contemplates striking a possessed Linda, she turns normal for a few minutes and begs Ash to protect her from 'them'. This was when I realized how my perception regarding the gory content changed when the characters transformed; it would have been much more disturbing to see a normal Linda being hacked to death. Bruce Campbell, the supporting cast and the 'fake shemps' deliver great performances for a horror movie. Some of the dialogs are very funny and very cheesy, with Linda getting some of the worst and most vapid lines in the film. The thing I did not understand about Evil Dead is how the entire 'monster mechanism' worked &#x96; while it seemed at times that the evil force could not enter the 'cabin' (Ash closes the doors and locks the force outside), Linda gets possessed all of a sudden even though Cheryl only stabs her with an object and doesn't bite her. I saw Evil Dead twice and thoroughly enjoyed it both the times. While its sequel sells out for popcorn fun, Evil Dead remains spooky, funny, unsettling and the superior one.

Trent travels to Hobbs End, an out of the way little town which seems eerily familiar from Cane's novels ...I don't know why but I really like stories where the protagonist is slowly losing their mind (see, for example, The Tenant or Videodrome) and I think this is perhaps my favourite example. Much like Cane's fiction, it's really impossible to summarise the plot of this movie with any kind of accuracy - you just have to see it. For me, it's an incredibly daring narrative, all about the blur between reality and fiction, sanity and insanity, both for Trent as he experiences the events of the plot but also for us as we experience the movie. Carpenter's genius is to create scenes which immediately pull us in and absorb us, but just as rapidly disorient us into disbelieving what we're seeing via a dizzying variety of visual tricks. There are special effects and jump cuts, flashbacks and dreams, powerful montages, pyrotechnic camera-work with wild use of overheads and other weird angles, distorted use of colour and filters, a repeated sequence where the film seems to break and a nihilistic self-mocking tragi-comic ending which for sheer surrealism outdoes anything in the movies of Jean-Luc Godard or David Lynch. It's an amazing cinematic treatment, with eye-popping sequences such as the Twilight Zone journey to Hobbs End, or the incredible moment where Cane tears himself apart to form a breach between his fiction and his reality, but it's also a fascinating treatise on the power of literature and the cult of personality. Cane is perhaps a sly dig at Stephen King (who is my favourite author) but he's really more in the vein of Howard Phillips Lovecraft or Edgar Allan Poe, whose admirers will often confess to having a physical reaction to and personal relationship with their books. The idea that words can carry a corporeal power in of themselves is not original to this story, but I've never seen a movie that explores it with such wit and gleeful abandon. Virtually every scene is full of unsettling detail (the children chasing the dog, the picture in the hotel, the fearful doubt in Warner's eyes) and the Hobbs End locations are somehow beautiful and disturbing at the same time - the incredible Black Church, the villain's lair, is amazingly a real place in Markham, Ontario. As with so many of Carpenter's films this is all of a piece, generating atmosphere through rhythm and movement, building into an overall feeling of dread and horror. The individual elements are all well done, but combine into something so much more than the sum of the parts. Trent is a classic logical hero, whose constant rationalisation of everything is his literal undoing, and Neill is simply outstanding in the part, his transformation from savvy gumshoe to terrified victim full of bravura scenes and offbeat moments. The rest of the cult cast are all terrific in support, notably Prochnow as the wicked Creator\/Artist (his first appearance is simply sensational) and the paperboy on the bike is a future Darth Vader, would you believe. The melodic piano-and-guitar score by Carpenter and Jim Lang is fabulous, and Gary B. Kibbe's stylish photography and Edward A. Warschilka's razor-blade editing sweep everything along and pump up all the scares. Brilliantly written by Michael DeLuca, the then boss of production company New Line Cinema, this forms the final part of Carpenter's unofficial Apocalypse Trilogy, the first two movies being the very different but equally stunning The Thing and Prince Of Darkness. A terrific, totally original, very challenging, mindbendingly devious, super-scary horror masterpiece.

","genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"},{"date":"1 November 2012","score":"","review":" Dedee Truitt, a wild, rebellious Louisiana teenager, runs away from home after her stepfather's funeral and moves in with her half-brother Bill. Bill, who is much older than his sister, is a gay teacher living in an affluent suburban community in Indiana with his young lover, Matt. Dedee takes a fancy to the good-looking Matt who, unknown to Bill, is actually bisexual, and seduces him, then elopes with him, after tricking him into believing that he has got her pregnant. (She is pregnant, but by another man). To make matters worse for Bill, he is falsely accused of sexually assaulting Jason, one of his former students.The plot gets a lot more complicated than that, but I won't set out all its twists and turns. Three other characters who play an important part are Randy, Dedee's ex-boyfriend and the real father of her child, Lucia, the sister of Bill's deceased partner Tom, and Carl, a policeman who is romantically interested in Lucia. (Lucia is always apologising for the fact that her name is not pronounced in the Italian way, which she seems to think was an error on the part of her parents, but in fact the pronunciation she uses, Loosha, was the traditional English form of the name, and is still preserved in the name of the Caribbean island of St Lucia). The film was both written and directed by Don Roos. It was the first film to be directed by him, although he had previously written a few scripts. These included Diabolique, that dreadful remake of Clouzot's Les Diaboliques, and Single White Female, an enjoyable if not particularly original thriller, but The Opposite of Sex is far more imaginative than either of those.(It perhaps has some similarities with Roos's quirky script for Love Field). The film has been described as politically incorrect for its view of gay life, and was even marketed under the slogan You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll be offended. I did not, however, find anything about the film particularly offensive. Certainly, Jason is a fairly unpleasant character, and Matt a bit of an airhead, but the idea that no gay or bisexual character can ever be shown in anything other than a positive light is a patronising one, like the idea that no film can ever have a black villain. In any case, Jason is treated in a much less negative way in this black comedy than a character making false allegations against a teacher would have been treated in a serious drama, and the film has one positive gay character in the shape of the decent, kindly and likable Bill. Bill is also portrayed as quiet, sober and conservative, something unusual in Hollywood which generally prefers gay characters to be camp, witty and flamboyant. There is a quite remarkable performance from the eighteen-year-old Christina Ricci as Dedee. Ricci had already made her name as a child star in films like The Addams Family and its sequel and Casper, and had made the transition to more adult roles in The Ice Storm the previous year. Dedee is a wonderful character- rude, cynical and with no respect for anyone, but possessed of a certain intelligence and a ready wit. She says that she will not turn out to have a heart of gold, and means it, but we sense that her crude, rebellious nature is the result of an unhappy childhood, the details of which we never precisely learn. The title of the film derives from one of her sarcastic observations about life, that sex is precisely the opposite of what people should want, as it leads to kids, disease or, worst of all, relationships. Ricci received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Comedy; watching this film reminded me of how surprised I was to learn that she has never won, or even been nominated for, an Oscar. But then, The Opposite of Sex is the sort of clear-eyed, unsentimental film that the Academy has never much cared for. Of the other actors the one who most impressed me was Martin Donovan as Bill. Johnny Galecki as Jason was a bit annoying and Lisa Kudrow as Lucia occasionally reminded me too much of her Phoebe from Friends, even though the characters are supposed to be quite different. The American cinema- and this was as true in the nineties as it is today- is often criticised for its conservatism- not in the political sense but in the sense that it can become excessively reliant on the familiar and the tried and tested. Occasionally, however, Hollywood can come up with something brilliantly new, and there were a number of such films in the late nineties, Peter Weir's The Truman Show and Sam Mendes's American Beauty being two particularly outstanding examples. The Opposite of Sex is perhaps not in the same class as those masterpieces, but it is nevertheless a refreshingly cynical black comedy with an original take on human relationships. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"1 November 2012","score":"","review":" Dedee Truitt, a wild, rebellious Louisiana teenager, runs away from home after her stepfather's funeral and moves in with her half-brother Bill.
