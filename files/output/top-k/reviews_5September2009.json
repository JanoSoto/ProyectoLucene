A man that is so depressed that he self commits himself to a mental ward at Fairfax Hospital, VA., feeling that he has no purpose in life and makes no difference that he exists. He realizes that the therapy he is receiving makes him feel no better, but realizes that the inmakes on the ward are in worse shape than he is and getting no better either. He finds that he, as a patient, more in touch with reality, tries a different approach and he makes a difference. Thus begins the transformation of Patch Adams, who makes it his life long dedication to help people who are worse off than he is and to use the special talents and intelligence given to him to become a doctor. I have spent a great deal of time at Fairfax Hospital for care of my children and medical care I required.Two of my children were born there.Doctors have become more sensitive to patients than in the past. Some refuse to give up the stiffness, that is their own problem of not being able to change. Perhaps Patch Adams is a bit strong for some to deal with, but his patients respected him for his ability to see them as human beings.Patch insisted to know the name of a patient, as Fairfax Hospital and many other hospitals are teaching hospitals. The medical profession has come a long way for doctors who see the light that Patch Adams was trying to shine to open their eyes, that book knowledge is only part of being a good doctor. Patch Adams wanted doctors to see that if they wanted respect from their patients, they needed to respect their patients and understand that they had feelings, and to at least call them by their name. The children in the cancer ward, if one is knowledgeable, there are Child Life Programs to deal with the feelings and help the children who are long term or terminal patients to deal with the trauma of hospitalization, and deal with the medical procedures that the children will be experiencing to reduce their fear, a job the medical staff is too overloaded with to perform while doing their own responsibilities to have time to spend to add to their load. The best hospitals in the country all have Child Life Programs, Fairfax Hospital, Children's Hospital in Pittsburgh, and John Hopkins, to name a few. Patch Adams' colleagues realized that he had a good point, it was just a concept that they were never taught as part of their medical practice. The movie was meant to teach a story, but at the same time to be entertaining. No patient likes an arrogant doctor who thinks that he is a superior being to a patient, or who does not take the time to consider what the patient is trying to tell them. Patch Adams was a dedicated doctor who felt that the needs of his patients included more than medication. He never felt medicine was not part of their care or medical school would not have been so critical to him.

Not I. Now that he's done Meet The Parents, it's clear that his flair for comedy was more than just a fluke in Analyze This...but I digress. De Niro was exactly the right combination of understated and comedic-tough for the role of Paul Vitti, the mob boss who suddenly finds it difficult to carry out his job. Vitti is one of the few people alive who, when he gets to the hospital emergency room, would have preferred to hear that he's had a heart attack rather than a panic attack. A fine line is drawn between comedy and violence in this movie. So when the curtains are drawn in the little area off the emergency ward so that the doctor could be beaten up (off camera) for having the gall to insist that Vitti had a panic attack, it's funny rather than appalling. Billy Crystal is the only actor (with the possible exception of Bill Murray) who could carry off the role of psychiatrist Ben Sobel, who makes his living trying to solve the problems of others but who has quite a few of his own, thank you. He's jealous of his famous psychiatrist-writer father. His overweight son spys on sessions through a hole in the ceiling. He's been through a tough divorce. And his attempted weddings to news anchor Laura (Lisa Kudrow) keeps getting interrupted by Paul Vitti's problems. Lisa Kudrow is wonderful and my only complaint with this movie is that she should have been given more to do. In the DVD version, Harold Ramis does admit in his commentaries that the mostly-male writing team couldn't think of enough to make the most of Lisa's considerable talents. Chazz Palmenteri is indescribably delicious as the rival boss who wants Paul Vitti dead. And the young actor cast as Billy Crystal's son has an easygoing, vivacious talent and has a great career ahead of him. Possibly as the next Billy Crystal! This movie was perfectly cast and is absolutely hilarious. Forget renting it. It's worth OWNING. On DVD, so you can have all the extras. This is currently my favorite Robert De Niro film (based on his acting abilities, anyway. Cape Fear is the only one that I loved based on my hormones alone, stirred by the darkly sexy long hair he wore as Max Cady). And based on acting abilities alone, needless to say, De Niro's is a formidible list. ...

It is the only one that starts out well and continues being very good to the end. Many of the others seemed to start out well, had a good plot idea, held your interest, but then towards the end unraveled, almost as if someone was hurrying him to finish. The Green Mile was nearly flawless. The characters were well defined, and very well acted. We definitely came to have an opinion of them, some we liked very much and some we really did not like, especially Wild Bill, could there be a character we dislike more? Percy was a very close second, someone we did not like at all. It made you wonder exactly which side of the bars Percy should have been on, as mean and nasty as he could be. I was actually surprised when I found out it was a Stephen King based novel. I don't mean to take away from his writing, once handed over to Hollywood, the person writing the screen play may not have an understanding how the characters were woven together and how important it was to leave the weaving completely unchanged to keep the tone of the story. I'm sure Stephen King is big enough now to get writers' approval of what has been done, if he's not writing the screenplay himself. The Green Mile was perfectly woven, the good guys were good, and the bad guys were bad, I mean you really did not like them at all. I didn't even like Wild Bill in the next movie he appeared in remembering the evil character he played in this film. I found it so disarming that the regular guards, Paul (Tom Hanks); Brutus (David Morse); Dean (Barry Pepper); and Harry (Jeffrey DeMunn) of The Green Mile were so calm, and made an effort to make an atmosphere pleasant for these men who were doomed to die anyway. I hadn't even thought about it one way or the other; they are bad men, why would we want to be civil with them at all? But the way they thought of them, they were found guilty and they are going to die, treating them like the animals they acted like was not necessary, they were already getting the maximum punishment, that provocation would only make them more dangerous, after all, they have nothing left to lose, it pays to treat them with dignity and respect, which had they ever been treated that way in the past maybe they wouldn't be there at all, keeping them calm and relaxed so that they are less trouble. They had a good thing going until Percy was transferred to The Mile. This man was sadistic, and felt he was bullet-proof as far as his job was concerned since his Mother was the Governor's wife. No rules applied to Percy, he did what he wanted when he wanted, there was a part of him that belonged on the other side of the bars. John Coffey saw this in him, and definitely saw Wild Bill for who he was, a gift John was tired of dealing with on a weekly, daily, hourly basis, seeing into the hearts and minds of people during the depression, heck, probably anytime, and seeing the darkness of souls is something I wouldn't consider a gift either. His true gift was that he could heal people. The scene in which he first sees what is in the Warden's wife and then removes it is very powerful. You see her at first visibly very ill and not in her right mind, then you see John Coffey take it out and she looks like herself again. She knows she is grateful to him, but not why; it is a very moving scene. John my not seem smart but he sure does the smart thing; he takes the brain tumor from the warden's wife and then gives it to Percy, who then takes out his gun out and shoots Wild Bill, he got both cruel men with one single act. It was true justice. Then Paul (Tom Hanks) and the other guards come to realization that they are going to have to kill this man; knowing he is innocent, and understanding that he has a gift to heal people; but they do not know what cost this gift has, so they don't understand he'd rather end it all so he can stop hearing all the bad things in people's minds. He is a black man in 1930's, so kindness is not what he sees in those minds. Just for being who he is will automatically bring out the worst of white people in the South. He'd consider it a favor if they would put and end to it all, but to give Paul a glimpse of what he sees everyday he shows Paul what he's seen to convince him that killing him would be like putting down a wounded animal. Putting people down must not be a very good job, but like the rest of the earth's species, there are many born with malady's that make them unfit to move with the regular heard. If there was a way to simply exile them from the populous, like the animal kingdom does, though many do also simply kill them. But if you do this for a living, it must be very difficult if you do not have an attitude and set of standards to stick to that makes it as simple as it can be. Best Stephen King movie I've ever seen, it is a very good movie, a little dark, but if you watch the news every night, you know the dark side exists in all of us, and shows itself more often in many.

When we meet him, his life is PAINFULLY ordinary. He works a poop job that he hates, he leads a sexless marriage with his wife that he has no love for anymore, whacking off in the shower is his high point and his daughter hates him. His life seems to be going downhill fast till he goes to his daughter's school function and falls for her cheerleader friend Angela. He has fantasies about her, which all somehow include rose petals. He decides that in order to have a chance with Angela he must start working out so he can look good naked. This begins to trigger a change in his life as he begins to do all the things he's always wanted do. He quits his job and gets a new one flipping burgers, buys himself a pretty sweet car and he begins to take charge of his life. All seems to be going well for good ol' Lester till his homophobic neighbor gets the wrong idea and does something horrible to our hero. -Who knew that an average looking town filled with seemingly average people could make such an interesting story. Alan Ball did and thank goodness he had such a sick and twisted mind to write this great story. Fans of the great and badly missed Six Feet Under will no doubt recognize all the weird Alan Ball signature in this movie that he translated into the TV show. From the weird fantasies to regular people, doing weird things is all Alan Ball at his best. I'm guessing if I were to peek into his mind I wouldn't find a happy man leading an ordinary life like the characters he comes up with seem to be. Considering the tone of the movie and just how f***king creepy the opening is one would think this would be a serious movie but it has more laughs than the crap that get passed as comedies nowadays. -The best filmmakers always somehow seem to be a smidge overweight and the brilliant Sam Mendes continues that unhealthy trend. i guess i have to gain a couple if i ever want that golden statue. Mendes has this great obsession with simplicity that goes hand in hand with Ball's quirky script. Most filmmakers would probably go ever board with the story and turn the dark humor into slapstick but Mendes keeps his cool and in the process makes the movie better for it. I've only seen three of his movies and this is best yet. I just love how he took things that looked simple in Ball's script like the paper bag caught in the wind and made it into something beautiful like the way it is in the movie now. Can't wait for his next potential masterpiece. the late great Conrad L. Hall will always be remembered as one of the great DP's of our time and this movie as one of his best looking. Much like Mendes the cinematography is very simple and has many hidden messages if you looked closely or watched the movie 1000 times. -One thing I love about this movie is the nail biting suspense in the last act. I just love the scene when Chris Cooper goes up to Spacey and you just don't know what this crazy man is going to do. Is he going to kill him, punch him or kiss him? I've never had a movie do that to me before and I really loved it. Really gets you into the movie. Giving his best performance yet is Keyer Soze as Lester Burnham. he's a man that want more in life and his transformation from boring normal everyday life to happy and content is captured wonderfully by Spacey.

It caused some controversy as many people thought that crown should have gone to Denzel. -Thora Birch dose a brilliant job of playing the Goth like Jane who despite her short screen time manages to capture you and really makes you feel for her character although she does get whiny like a lot of us around that age. this and Ghost World are the best acting jobs she's done and I hope she gets more jobs that showcase her talents. Mena Suvari does the job of the insecure seductress really well. I love how her character isn't all one dimensional as we learn more about why she puts on such a shallow exterior. Chris Cooper plays the homophobic army man nicely so does his wife whose played by an unrecognizable Allison Janney.

When we meet him, his life is PAINFULLY ordinary. He works a poop job that he hates, he leads a sexless marriage with his wife that he has no love for anymore, whacking off in the shower is his high point and his daughter hates him. His life seems to be going downhill fast till he goes to his daughter's school function and falls for her cheerleader friend Angela. He has fantasies about her, which all somehow include rose petals. He decides that in order to have a chance with Angela he must start working out so he can look good naked. This begins to trigger a change in his life as he begins to do all the things he's always wanted do. He quits his job and gets a new one flipping burgers, buys himself a pretty sweet car and he begins to take charge of his life. All seems to be going well for good ol' Lester till his homophobic neighbor gets the wrong idea and does something horrible to our hero. -Who knew that an average looking town filled with seemingly average people could make such an interesting story. Alan Ball did and thank goodness he had such a sick and twisted mind to write this great story. Fans of the great and badly missed Six Feet Under will no doubt recognize all the weird Alan Ball signature in this movie that he translated into the TV show. From the weird fantasies to regular people, doing weird things is all Alan Ball at his best. I'm guessing if I were to peek into his mind I wouldn't find a happy man leading an ordinary life like the characters he comes up with seem to be. Considering the tone of the movie and just how f***king creepy the opening is one would think this would be a serious movie but it has more laughs than the crap that get passed as comedies nowadays. -The best filmmakers always somehow seem to be a smidge overweight and the brilliant Sam Mendes continues that unhealthy trend. i guess i have to gain a couple if i ever want that golden statue. Mendes has this great obsession with simplicity that goes hand in hand with Ball's quirky script. Most filmmakers would probably go ever board with the story and turn the dark humor into slapstick but Mendes keeps his cool and in the process makes the movie better for it. I've only seen three of his movies and this is best yet. I just love how he took things that looked simple in Ball's script like the paper bag caught in the wind and made it into something beautiful like the way it is in the movie now. Can't wait for his next potential masterpiece. the late great Conrad L. Hall will always be remembered as one of the great DP's of our time and this movie as one of his best looking. Much like Mendes the cinematography is very simple and has many hidden messages if you looked closely or watched the movie 1000 times. -One thing I love about this movie is the nail biting suspense in the last act.

What studio executive would give the green light to a film with a black character named Spearchucker,a priest named Dago Red,and a dentist who attempts suicide because he thinks that he's becoming a fairy? Seen with some historical context,Altman's scathing anti-establishment comedy is far from perfect,but the best moments are riotously funny(for all the wrong reasons)and the film expresses the rebellious mood of America in 1970 with absolute accuracy. It manages to do that without ever commenting directly on the war. Though the setting is 1950's Korea,it really 1970's Vietnam. The only time Altman and writer Ring Lardner come close to making an overt political statement is in their funniest one liner. When by-the-book Major Margaret Houlihan(Sally Kellerman)says of Dr.Hawkeye Pierce(Donald Sutherland),I wonder how a degenerated person like that could have reached a position of responsibility in the Army Medical Corps? He was drafted, is the deadpan answer. In 1970,the line had audiences howling with laughter.War itself is really not a subject. The only gunshot in the film is used to end the climactic football game. The nameless broken bodies that are flown into the hospital are the only evidence of the conflict. Altman shows war's destructiveness in those graphic wounds and bloody operating rooms. Those moments had never been presented so realistically on screen. Audiences who went to see this film in 1970 were horrified,and so any further comment would have been irrelevant. Altman's real targets are closer to home-organized religion and the military,both seen by the filmmakers as close minded institutions,inimical to genuine human values. They're personified in the characters of Maj. Houlihan and Maj.

He is such a forceful character that he would upset the shaky comic balance of the film if he didn't make such an early exit. Hotlips Houlihan is more troubling. She is transformed presumably by the embarrassment of the shower scene,from a competent if narrow minded nurse into a brainless cheerleader. The change may be due to over-enthusiasm improvisation on Sally Kellerman's part during the football sequence. The protagonists are stronger characters,too. In the operating room,they're accomplished professionals. Outside,they're lecherous sophomoric pranksters with a wide mean streak. Altman's direction is completely true with the doctors' knockabout attitude. He uses filters to give a rougher texture to the already rough surfaces of the M*A*S*H unit;long lenses allow him to keep the camera at a distance to encourage ensemble improvisation;dialogue from one scene extended to the next;semi linear narrative.And within that often chaotic structure,the big scenes are masterful-the unforgettable microphone under the bed,the extended suicide sequence,complete with the Last Supper tableau,the use of the public address system as a cracked Greek chorus,even the nonsensical football game. If,in hindsight,M*A*S*H seems harsher than it once did,but in all aspects it is still funny and original,and it anger is not misplaced.

It's a mix between the absolutely fantastic (duh), the surreal, the beauty and the horror; it's a mix between the sweetest dream and the most grotesque of nightmares. This wonderfully appealing and appalling premise is the drive behind Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro's classic film, La Cité des Enfants Perdus. The plot itself is just a tad bit complicated, but here goes It's about an ex-sailor-gone-freak, super-strong man called One (Ron Perlman), who's strength capable of snapping metal chains comes paired with a mental retardation and a serious language problem. He's the 'big brother' (or caretaker, if you will) of a small, abandoned child who's only interest in this world is eating, and is oblivious to all else. One night, the child is mysteriously kidnapped by a band of hideous men with golden, mechanical left eyes, and poor One tries to follow them.These mechanical-eyed men (whom we later learn call themselves Cyclops) send One's little brother away, but One learns that they do shady thievery with a gang of rough, orphan children. They help these children steal things, take their large share, and leave them the rest of it. In turn, the orphans take their spoils to their evil matrons, two identical twins physically joined by one foot. The hunky and dim-witted One befriends one of the orphans, an intelligent and mature-minded young girl called Miette (Judith Vittet), and she decides to help him rescue his kidnapped brother...much to the chagrin of the vindictive, evil twins.Meanwhile, in a metallic island stranded smack in the middle of a mined ocean, there lives an evil scientist (Daniel Emilfork) who doesn't dream, and who uses little children's mind to extract their dreams (he dreams of being Santa Claus), but whenever he does so, the only things he gets are excruciatingly horrid nightmares. He dreams of finding the one child who won't produce nightmares for him, and he sends his dwarf wife and his six identical (and also dim-witted, Robin Williams-look alikes) sons in search for them. There's also a living machine powered by a brain that lives in this metallic island, but I can't say anything about it (or is it him?) because that would be giving too much away.Anyway, the film joins these two stories seamlessly, and follows our main heroes One and Miette as they go through a series of quirky, slightly amusing and disturbing events involving a series of equally quirky characters, each one weirder than the last. As a matter of fact, it's one of the most interesting and original plot lines I've ever seen.The script is very funny. The costumes are, well...they're designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier, so imagine the possibilities (though don't expect outfits worthy of fashion runways here; think the opposite). The photography is simply splendid, colourful, and the lenses are used to give the characters alternately a comic and a gruesome appearance. The music reminded me of a troubling circus, and it's well it should do that, because the film seems as if we've taken a ride through a circus full of gross and amusing characters.Jeunet and Caro have outdone themselves. There is also the element of art here. It's a surreal film, and it attempts to present us with images drawn from the subconscious, portraying the nature of human dreams and expectations and human ties as well (albeit in a very magical way).And it never lags! From the very first moment, till the end of the second hour you'll be amazed and entertained. If there's a film that fully entertains while being artistic and refreshingly original, it's bound to be embedded into my mind. So regarding this film, that's fine with me!

It's a mix between the absolutely fantastic (duh), the surreal, the beauty and the horror; it's a mix between the sweetest dream and the most grotesque of nightmares. This wonderfully appealing and appalling premise is the drive behind Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro's classic film, La Cité des Enfants Perdus. The plot itself is just a tad bit complicated, but here goes It's about an ex-sailor-gone-freak, super-strong man called One (Ron Perlman), who's strength capable of snapping metal chains comes paired with a mental retardation and a serious language problem. He's the 'big brother' (or caretaker, if you will) of a small, abandoned child who's only interest in this world is eating, and is oblivious to all else. One night, the child is mysteriously kidnapped by a band of hideous men with golden, mechanical left eyes, and poor One tries to follow them.These mechanical-eyed men (whom we later learn call themselves Cyclops) send One's little brother away, but One learns that they do shady thievery with a gang of rough, orphan children. They help these children steal things, take their large share, and leave them the rest of it. In turn, the orphans take their spoils to their evil matrons, two identical twins physically joined by one foot. The hunky and dim-witted One befriends one of the orphans, an intelligent and mature-minded young girl called Miette (Judith Vittet), and she decides to help him rescue his kidnapped brother...much to the chagrin of the vindictive, evil twins.Meanwhile, in a metallic island stranded smack in the middle of a mined ocean, there lives an evil scientist (Daniel Emilfork) who doesn't dream, and who uses little children's mind to extract their dreams (he dreams of being Santa Claus), but whenever he does so, the only things he gets are excruciatingly horrid nightmares. He dreams of finding the one child who won't produce nightmares for him, and he sends his dwarf wife and his six identical (and also dim-witted, Robin Williams-look alikes) sons in search for them. There's also a living machine powered by a brain that lives in this metallic island, but I can't say anything about it (or is it him?) because that would be giving too much away.Anyway, the film joins these two stories seamlessly, and follows our main heroes One and Miette as they go through a series of quirky, slightly amusing and disturbing events involving a series of equally quirky characters, each one weirder than the last. As a matter of fact, it's one of the most interesting and original plot lines I've ever seen.The script is very funny. The costumes are, well...they're designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier, so imagine the possibilities (though don't expect outfits worthy of fashion runways here; think the opposite). The photography is simply splendid, colourful, and the lenses are used to give the characters alternately a comic and a gruesome appearance.

I had never heard of it, and knew nothing about its general reception. I read the blurb on the back of the case, and thought it looked interesting, so I decided to rent it. By the time I watched it, I think I knew it wasn't the most popular crime thriller ever made, and like probably many other viewers, I was disappointed, finding it to be a rather weak film of its genre. Earlier this week, I rented it again. I couldn't remember it that well from my first viewing, and decided to give it a second chance. This time, I had lower expectations than before, but was expecting to be more impressed than I was the first time, which I was. That doesn't mean I didn't notice any severe flaws this time, though.Roy Egan is a retired thief who is lured out of retirement by his younger brother, Lee, for a major jewel heist. Lee has chosen two other partners for this robbery, Jorge Montana and Skip Kovich. The heist is a success, but afterwards, Skip gets greedy and suddenly kills Lee and Jorge! He tries to kill Roy as well, but the veteran thief manages to get away! After this, Roy swears to have his vengeance for the killing of his brother, and sets out on a mission to find the whereabouts of Skip! During this mission, his foe realizes he is searching for him, and is obviously not going to make it any easier for him. Roy isn't the only one who has suffered a loss in the family as a result of Skip's greed and insanity. The lunatic's other victim, Jorge, has left behind his wife and kids. His widow, Rachel, is eventually involved in Roy's mission after she learns what has happened to her husband.Harvey Keitel plays the starring role of Roy Egan, and does a decent job, but this may not be the case with the entire cast. I didn't care much for Stephen Dorff as Skip Kovich, but I'm not entirely sure if that was because of the actor's performance or because of the character. The characters in this film are generally pretty shallow. There isn't much emotional depth or detail to them. However, at least there are some characters I could sympathize with, most notably Rachel Montana, and I guess Roy Egan to a certain extent. There are fairly weak moments, such as some unnecessary sex scenes (at least one involving Skip and his girlfriend), the film drags at times, and the dialogue may not be perfect. Despite these flaws, there's still at least some suspense, as well as poignant moments, and enough to keep me interested until the end, during my second viewing, that is.Now that I've seen City of Industry twice, I don't exactly think it's bad, as I definitely found more redeeming qualities the second time than I did the first (I'm not sure if I really found any the first time), and a major reason for this is that it just MIGHT be a better film to watch alone. On the other hand, it's still a flawed thriller, flawed enough for me to see why it's so polarizing and has been widely overlooked since its release in the late 90's. I wouldn't have really been missing out on THAT much if I had never noticed this film in the video store several years ago (meaning I still wouldn't be aware of its existence now), and I certainly wouldn't consider it a must-see for anyone, but if you like this genre, maybe this movie will do. Just don't expect anything too brilliant or original.

She can do better than than this!) she really made it almost a drag to see her on screen (but hey at least she's nice to look at.) all in all she was the main weak point in this film not Keanu.When you over look the main outer layers of the story and get dug and see the inner layers you can fully comprehend and see the near greatness of this film and the great style it brings to the the thriller genre all in all The Watcher delivers great edge of your seat, blow out the lights entertainment you can't over look. Basically this film flat out rocks.

I had seen and loved many of Leone's earlier films. Ironically, however, I watched for the first time his breakout movie (Fistful of Dollars) and this, his last, within two days of each other. Night and day. Fistful is a masterpiece, wonderful in so many ways. America, however, does not work on many levels -- many of which are pretty objective and so I am shocked at how many people love this film and claim it deserves to be in an all timer category. I would rate it as my least favorite Leone film.The problems, as I see them are (i) This is not a four hour film. It is a 2.5 hour film stretched to four by overly indulgent long scenes of people staring at each other. I admire artistic choice but (a) did not feel the artistic feel to his scenes worked, they felt over indulgent; and (b) found them unforgivable in taking a movie that did not need to be so long and stretching it (actually, this could have been a proper 4 hour movie, with an extra hour of plot put in). (ii) There was little emotional impact to the overall story. People love to romanticize gangster pics for some reason, but I was not seeing it here. The Max faked his death angle was (a) obvious, predicted it as soon as I realized who Max was; (b) hokey; and (c) the big reveal was perhaps the least interesting part of the movie. (iii) The plot is choppy and we don't get a clear enough view of certain characters. This is not a major attack, but if the first two had worked, this would have kept the film out of masterpiece status. (iv) Not impressed with the acting. Elizabeth McGovern was frankly awful. DeNiro, eh. Woods, OK. Loved Jennifer Connelly. (v) The music was like Quint running his fingers down the chalkboard. Loved it in other Leone films. Hated it here.In conclusion, this is not an awful movie. It has positive elements. It is beautifully filmed in many instances. There is somewhat of an epic and historical feel, even if the plot does not completely work. But such a disappointment compared to expectations based on Leone's earlier works. I can see how people would like this film more than I. I am dumbfounded that anyone could rationally state that this is the best (or even one of the best) films ever as so many posters have.

I can say that after seeing the film, all the stories floating around it are true. It is one of the most intense movie experiences I have ever had in my life.Requiem for a Dream, based on the novel by Hubert Shelby Jr., follows Harry (Jared Leto), his best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans), his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly), and his lonely mother (Ellen Burstyn) as they each realize there dreams of money and happiness, only to have them transformed into horrific nightmares by drugs and narcotics.Darron Aronofsky definitely shows his directing skills in Requiem. Every scene is torn down frame by frame, and then cut back together to give a strange psychedelic feel to the movie. It's a little like Pink Floyds The Wall, except there are actually characters and a plot that we can follow. The editing and directing is definitely the best aspect of Requiem, because it is so imaginative. The music is another brilliant piece that adds to the suspenseful and disturbing vibe.The overall plot of the movie is isn't very deep, and leaves a slight feeling of being let down, like there was more potential there. Also, there could have been a little more character development because even the main characters seemed a little flat. But other than that, everything else was brilliant. All the actors are in top form, especially Ellen Burstyn who gives a truly amazing performance as a drug addicted old lady. Even Marlon Wayans shows his unique range in the film.The most famous part of Requiem by far is its reputation for being intense. And the film definitely lives up to its name. This was the first time I have ever felt like walking out of the movie before it was over not because it was bad, but because it is almost too much to take in at once. It accomplishes what horror movies try so hard to do, by creating a truly chilling atmosphere as the characters fall into a living hell. It is this intensity, however, that makes watching the movie so unique that everyone should experience at least once. Requiem grabs your heart as the characters find happiness but doesn't let go as it drags you and its characters into the disturbing and sinister reality of addiction.Overall, Darren Aronofsky is once again able to create a very unique movie experience with Requiem through great visuals, music, and acting. I recommend that everyone see this movie at least once, because it leaves such a lasting impression on anyone who sees it.

Forget Astaire&Rogers, Cary Grant, The Hunchback Of Notre Dame, if you were below the age of 12 these were the films you wanted to see. Every Labor Day the Ape trilogy was run and when WOR had Million Dollar Movie all day, it's highest ratings went to the simians.When you realize that unlike the other two, Mighty Joe Young was specifically geared to that audience you can relax and return to your childhood to enjoy this film about two young lovers and their pet 15 foot gorilla.The same folks, Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack who did the Kong films have brought you this one and Willis O'Brien had a resident special effects genius as an assistant in Ray Harryhausen. Watching the film now I see clear traces of Harryhausen that become apparent in his later work.Young Terry Moore who is played in a prologue by Shirley Temple wannabe Lora Lee Michel is seen acquiring the baby gorilla to the chagrin of her father Regis Toomey. She must have cared for him good because he grew to some immense size.Enter Robert Armstrong whose character is clearly influenced by producer Billy Rose as it was in King Kong and Son Of Kong has come to Africa for publicity and animal acts in that order. He's brought some rodeo cowboys led by Ben Johnson and Terry Moore who's not seen any of the outside world is influenced by Armstrong's fast talk and Johnson's boyish charm to come to America with the gorilla named Mighty Joe Young.Of course if you remember the havoc that King Kong wrought upon New York when Armstrong brought him back, then you have some idea where the story is going. But only some idea believe me.Mighty Joe Young does have some stupidity in it. For instance I don't think any rodeo cowboy is good enough to capture a lion by roping him. But that's what the film has you believe about Ben Johnson. And Ben Johnson ought to know better because that's what he was before going into acting.Still the film has an innocent charm about it and you can't help, but like it and the characters in the film. I daresay if WOR ran it again it would get the same high ratings. It's a children's classic for kids of all ages.

That is, the format is pure insanity the way Bringing Up Baby is insanity, but this isn't a clash of fairly normal types, here, but a celebration of delightful loonies. Yes, it can be ridiculous and a bit predictable, but that's the format of this kind of film.

In fact, the non-stop fireworks (literally and metaphorically) as well as the requisite Frank Capra feel good about being an American aura make this a really heartwarming movie, too. The bad guys aren't bad, the good guys get what they want, and along the way is a series of classic conflicts and confusions. Capra is a terrific thinking director, whatever his fuzzy sentiments, and he leads the viewer with cinematic sophistication, so we anticipate certain turns of plot and love them when they occur--the harmonica being a symbolic and obvious example.There is certainly an overt message behind all this--money can't buy love--but there are lots of smaller built-in aspects like the notion of community triumphing when people stick together (repeated in It's a Wonderful Life, which has several echos of this earlier movie). Or the idea that the meek inherit the earth--Jimmy Stewart being hopeless meek in the face of his father's corporate giddiness, and the terrific regular girl Jean Arthur a prototypical strong but humble woman.So--watch for clever and fast writing, for great (and not always hammy) acting by the four or five main characters that holds together even in its exaggerations, and for fast editing. But also watch how well filmed the movie is, both sets and camera-work. Capra was brilliant at squeezing every square inch of space out of a scene, but without drawing attention to itself (at least not until Arsenic and Old Lace, when it is part of the point to be self- referential). Even the busy, layered up sound is pushing boundaries for the time.Lionel Barrymore, the main character (in case I seem to have forgotten him) is as lovable and admirable as he is hate-able in Wonderful Life. Note how his disability, apparently from a fall in 1936 (and so not a factor in an early classic like Dinner at Eight), is incorporated into the plot.
