Sappy cinemaphiles who rhapsodized about Sleepless in Seattle inevitably will applaud Ephron's simple but charismatic recoupling of Ryan and Hanks. Discriminating audiences, on the other hand, may reject Mail for being manipulatively cute, slowly-paced, and thinly plotted fodder.Ostensibly, Ephron's frivolous but disposable soaper updates director Ernest Lubitsch's The Shop around the Corner. In that venerable but uneven 1940 comedy, James Stewart and Margaret Sullivan portrayed two clashing curio store clerks who exchange anonymous but endearing letters. Incidentally, not only did Miklos Laszlo's play Parfumerie serve as the basis for the Lubitsch comedy, but it also inspired director Robert Z. Leonard's 1949 musical In the Good Old Summertime that mated Judy Garland with Van Johnson.Just for the record, The Shop around the Corner ranks as no great shakes itself. Maudlin and claustrophobic, with a subplot featuring infidelity and suicide, the Lubitsch comedy is still rather depressing for a film produced during the Golden Age of Hollywood. Michael director Nora Ephron and sister Delia Ephron have adapted Samson Raphaelson's Shop screenplay, preserving its better parts and contriving a few twists of their own. In their warm and fuzzy remake, the Ephrons have changed the setting from pre-World War II Budapest to contemporary New York City. Not surprisingly, because Nora Ephron lives on the Upper West Side, You've Got Mail makes Manhattan look like the better side of the rainbow. The sisters Ephron have expanded the scope of the action, too, so that the principals no longer toil under the same roof with the same tyrannical boss.As Joe Fox, Tom Hanks of Forrest Gump plays the son of a wealthy family that owns Fox Books, a conglomerate book store a la Barnes & Noble which swallows smaller stores. Although Joe epitomizes capitalism at its most ruthless extreme, the filmmakers go to great lengths to take the sting out of his villainy. Not only do they show him taking his father's children by a second wife out to play, but they also saddle Joe with a shaggy Irish setter. Can anybody say Turner and Hooch? Conversely, as Kathleen Kelly, Ryan runs a quaint little children's bookstore named The Shop Around the Corner that her mother left her. Perky as always with her hair fashionably disheveled, Ryan appears hopelessly adorable in whatever she dons, whether pajamas or pants suit. Essentially, Hanks and Ryan are the whole show, and their cinematic chemistry has not dimmed an iota since their initial coupling in the abysmal 1990 epic Joe Versus the Volcano. You've Got Mail marks the third time that they have teamed up.The conflict is pretty basic. Opening its newest superstore a block away, Fox Books poses a dire threat to Kathleen's livelihood as a longtime neighborhood staple. Unlike Sleepless in Seattle, where the Ryan and Hanks' characters eventually met at the end of the movie, You've Got Mail has their paths criss-crossing from the outset. The premise is that Kathleen and Joe meet in an-over-30 chat room at America-On-Line and have kindled a cozy e-mail relationship under the aliases of 'Shopgirl' and 'NY152.' Agreeing not to divulge any personal details, they have maintained a strictly platonic relationship. Nevertheless, they're so infatuated that they cannot wait for their live-in lovers to leave (they're singles) for work each day so that they can check their e-mail. Actually, Joe and Kathleen live only a few blocks apart, and Ephron shows early on how easily it is for these New Yorkers to walk the same streets without colliding. Joe is shacking up with a neurotic, caffeine-addicted book editor, Patricia Eden (indie movie queen Parker Posey), while Kathleen shares the same bed with a pretentious, bespectacled newspaper columnist, Frank Navasky (Greg Kinnear of As Good As It Gets. Eventually, Joe and Kathleen run afoul of each other at a publisher's party where she learns about Joe's notoriety. Dislike turns to hate when Fox Books lures Kathleen's customers away with its discounted books, cappuccino bar, and chairs to relax in and read. Faced with competition that will likely sink her small business, 'Shopgirl' seeks advice from 'NY152.' He suggests that she go to war. Rationalizing everything in terms of the movie The Godfather, he refers to the mafia epic as the sum of all wisdom and charts his life by it. Meanwhile, she interprets life through the pages of Jane Austin's classic weepie Pride and Prejudice. Despite the widespread protest that she generates in the media, Kathleen cannot compete with Fox, and she locks her doors after 42 years of business. Indeed, hostile takeovers of this kind raise few eyebrows in today's rabid business climate, but jarring realism of this sort seems distinctly out of place in an otherwise fluffy love story.Although You've Got Mail is a tale perfectly suited for today's technology, several obvious consequences have been overlooked. Never mind that Mail depicts women as passive and inexorably overwhelmed, makes breaking up appear like a picnic, and condones Republican style capitalism where big company gobble up small stores without a moral hiccup. Presumably, the sisters Ephron figured that audiences will dismiss these uneasy questions without a thought as they purr over the on-screen chemistry between Ryan and Hanks. Formulaic, flighty, flirtatious, and feel-good-all-around, You've Got Mail emerges also as a shameless infomercial for AOL, Macintosh computers, and Starbucks Coffee.

The book is a non-fiction book about main character and her time. I liked it but it is not historical fiction. I wouldn't recommend it unless you like scholarly non-fiction in feminist studies. The film claims to be a true story, but it really isn't. Not that much is known about Veronica Franco's life particularly the first part of it. There can be conjecture, of course, but the claim of it all being true is somewhat ambitious. Here is my original reviewThis film shows the methods a strong and intelligent woman might use to control men while making them feel as if they are in control of her. It shows women being witty, well educated, responsible and cleaver - often more so than men. Such would naturally appeal to many who find few cleaver women represented in modern films. The production values are good and there is an abundance of spectacle. Venice, itself, is a fascinating and exotic city. Filming there with a good crew and excellent costumes is sure to please and this film comes through in that department. Don't underestimate the value and pleasure of a well shot and costumed film. Many people go to films just to see such things. Even history buffs love to see a film that tries to represent what it must have been like at the timeThe film gets weaker when it comes to the script. Not that the script is bad, at times it is cleaver, but the plotting is predictable. The film claims to be a true story, because it was taken from an biography. Assuming the film is faithful to the biography, there are so many improbable things in the film that I would have to question how truthful the author was. (For example a mother raises her family to adulthood, and they do not know that she was once a famous courtesan in the very town they are living in.) Also it is difficult to imagine how Veronica on her first experience as a courtesan could come out with witty and bawdy poetry done off the cuff to an audience of nobles, when she had previously lived a cloistered existence perfecting her manners. Yes, she had had practice writing poetry, but not BAWDY poetry. Such things weaken the plot but they do not have to be fatal to the film. they are not major flaws and a film overcome them with strong acting, tight pacing and well handled dramatic moments.The acting, however, is not the best, and the pacing can sometimes be rather slow - much like the kind of pacing you would see on TV. If you are someone who wants acting that rings true, tight pacing and well handled drama, then this film will not appeal to you. History has been full of interesting, powerful and capable women. Women who have had incredible influence over men in the highest of positions, and women who have held those high positions without the aid of men. It was a woman, after all, who may have been history's most brilliant General - Joan of Arc. Yet it seems a surprise to many that a movie would dare to show that there were such women in history. If you like this movie, I recommend you start reading some history. There is a lot of it that is well written. Historical fiction is also interesting but real history is the best. In fact I think I will pick up a copy of The Honest Courtesan on which this film is based. For you see, I am one of those people who wants tight pacing, good acting and well handled drama. While I was disappointed in the film, I have a feeling that I might like the book much better.

","genre":"Biography, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"2 August 2008","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" James Cameron's Titanic holds up very well indeed after more than ten years since initial release. The minuses now are the same as then but they are minor in comparison to the plusses. First of all, the Titanic is one of the grandest tragedies of human history. The highest and mightiest could tumble. It was an analogy to the state of the world, almost like a foreshadowing of the First World War when all that seemed eternal disintegrated with spectacular suddenness.Cameron approaches the task primarily as a hardware technician. The ship looks the way it has to look - grandiose, solid, lavishly appointed. The physical details are spot on, down to the last piece of china. This all helps. The use of CGI during the prolonged sinking is largely state of the art even now.The idea of putting a story of young lovers at the center of the film is a sound, if trite, way to give us the universal through the particular. The film would have been just as gripping if Cameron had chosen a more Altmanesque approach whereby a whole group of characters would be given more or less equal weight as they made their way to journey's end. Here the focus is on the teenage couple unhappy rich girl (Kate Winslet) and working-class bohemian artiste (Leonardo DiCaprio). The problem with these usually fine actors is that too often their youthful brio seems forced, as if Cameron as director\/screenwriter is straining to point out their youth, their vitality, their exuberance, in contrast to Winslet's stuffy social set which disapproves of their alliance. The best acting comes from Billy Zane as the arrogant, sadistic, petulant fiancé of Winslet who stops at nothing to separate her from unwashed upstart DiCaprio. Zane gets it all right, including the clipped prep school accent which barely conceals his primal, frustrated rage at being trumped by someone from the lower classes. DiCaprio comes across as a modern suburban high school student playing a street urchin in a drama class presentation. There is no real edge to him. In fact, if the casting had been reversed it would have made much more sense. But DiCaprio's youth, looks and agility carry him through the spectacle. Besides, we don't go to spectacles for acting nuance.Cameron's script isn't as dreadful as some claim, but it has significant shortcomings. (Screenwriting was the only major category in which Titanic was not nominated for an Oscar - and for good reason.) A bit of working over by a competent script doctor would have made it truer. Amazingly, considering Cameron himself has some background in visual arts, the situations and dialogue touching on questions of painting are embarrassingly unimaginative and superficial. And much of the banter between Winslet and DiCaprio sounds late 20th century, not 1912. The conflict between the haughty first-class passengers and those beneath them is perhaps overdone. Frances Fisher is touching as Winslet's socially striving mother for whom we feel both pity and contempt as she pushes her daughter into marriage with a soulless brute. Gloria Stuart as Kate Winslet grown old and Victor Garber as the ship's designer who sees his master creation ripped asunder also stand out. And some of the dinner table conversation in the first-class dining room is elegant and witty.One implausibility The water temperature of the sea in which the Titanic sank was just above freezing. No human, save an Olympic athlete, or at least the young and vigorous, could have survived more than a few minutes in waters of that temperature. Survivors relate that the screaming of the passengers who landed in the water when the ship sank subsided after only a few minutes. None could survive the water. Yet Kate Winslet is seen wading neck deep in this ice bath for minutes on end as she struggles to rescue DiCaprio who has been handcuffed to steam pipes in a lower-level cabin. Then the two proceed through endless corridors of freezing water to the deck where they continue on, fighting their way through panicked crowds, breaking down barriers, leaping and scaling heights, etc. until they finally go down with the ship into the freezing sea where they survive for endless minutes more as they as they cling to debris.A CGI flaw Just as false, occasionally Cameron's keyboard tappers and mouse movers add little puffs of computer-generated condensed breath to accompany the exhalations of actors in close up. Problem is, only intermittently does this condensation appear. One moment you see it, another moment it's gone.The interminable lovey-dovey blatherings between Winslet and DiCaprio as they float in the ice water quickly wear thin. Perhaps pre-teen girls (a major component of this film's box office) would be transfixed by this interlude, but surely most adults would be yearning for DiCaprio's character to die and get it over with.And even more dreadful than everything cited above is the treacly Our Love Will Go On, a pop song belted by Celine Dion over the closing credits. I am sick and tired of contemporary pop songs being tacked on to historical dramas.Finally, the ultimate film to see on this subject is Titanic The Legend Lives On (1994), a fascinating and moving 4-hour-plus Arts & Entertainment Channel documentary about the Titanic from conception through construction through destruction, aftermath and cultural\/historical legacy. More emotionally involving and fascinating than Cameron's movie. It will stay with you for a long time.

The best acting comes from Billy Zane as the arrogant, sadistic, petulant fiancé of Winslet who stops at nothing to separate her from unwashed upstart DiCaprio. Zane gets it all right, including the clipped prep school accent which barely conceals his primal, frustrated rage at being trumped by someone from the lower classes. DiCaprio comes across as a modern suburban high school student playing a street urchin in a drama class presentation. There is no real edge to him. In fact, if the casting had been reversed it would have made much more sense. But DiCaprio's youth, looks and agility carry him through the spectacle. Besides, we don't go to spectacles for acting nuance.Cameron's script isn't as dreadful as some claim, but it has significant shortcomings. (Screenwriting was the only major category in which Titanic was not nominated for an Oscar - and for good reason.) A bit of working over by a competent script doctor would have made it truer. Amazingly, considering Cameron himself has some background in visual arts, the situations and dialogue touching on questions of painting are embarrassingly unimaginative and superficial. And much of the banter between Winslet and DiCaprio sounds late 20th century, not 1912. The conflict between the haughty first-class passengers and those beneath them is perhaps overdone. Frances Fisher is touching as Winslet's socially striving mother for whom we feel both pity and contempt as she pushes her daughter into marriage with a soulless brute. Gloria Stuart as Kate Winslet grown old and Victor Garber as the ship's designer who sees his master creation ripped asunder also stand out. And some of the dinner table conversation in the first-class dining room is elegant and witty.One implausibility The water temperature of the sea in which the Titanic sank was just above freezing. No human, save an Olympic athlete, or at least the young and vigorous, could have survived more than a few minutes in waters of that temperature. Survivors relate that the screaming of the passengers who landed in the water when the ship sank subsided after only a few minutes. None could survive the water. Yet Kate Winslet is seen wading neck deep in this ice bath for minutes on end as she struggles to rescue DiCaprio who has been handcuffed to steam pipes in a lower-level cabin. Then the two proceed through endless corridors of freezing water to the deck where they continue on, fighting their way through panicked crowds, breaking down barriers, leaping and scaling heights, etc. until they finally go down with the ship into the freezing sea where they survive for endless minutes more as they as they cling to debris.A CGI flaw Just as false, occasionally Cameron's keyboard tappers and mouse movers add little puffs of computer-generated condensed breath to accompany the exhalations of actors in close up. Problem is, only intermittently does this condensation appear. One moment you see it, another moment it's gone.The interminable lovey-dovey blatherings between Winslet and DiCaprio as they float in the ice water quickly wear thin. Perhaps pre-teen girls (a major component of this film's box office) would be transfixed by this interlude, but surely most adults would be yearning for DiCaprio's character to die and get it over with.And even more dreadful than everything cited above is the treacly Our Love Will Go On, a pop song belted by Celine Dion over the closing credits. I am sick and tired of contemporary pop songs being tacked on to historical dramas.Finally, the ultimate film to see on this subject is Titanic The Legend Lives On (1994), a fascinating and moving 4-hour-plus Arts & Entertainment Channel documentary about the Titanic from conception through construction through destruction, aftermath and cultural\/historical legacy.

","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"2 August 2008","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" James Cameron's Titanic holds up very well indeed after more than ten years since initial release. The minuses now are the same as then but they are minor in comparison to the plusses. First of all, the Titanic is one of the grandest tragedies of human history. The highest and mightiest could tumble. It was an analogy to the state of the world, almost like a foreshadowing of the First World War when all that seemed eternal disintegrated with spectacular suddenness.Cameron approaches the task primarily as a hardware technician. The ship looks the way it has to look - grandiose, solid, lavishly appointed. The physical details are spot on, down to the last piece of china. This all helps. The use of CGI during the prolonged sinking is largely state of the art even now.The idea of putting a story of young lovers at the center of the film is a sound, if trite, way to give us the universal through the particular. The film would have been just as gripping if Cameron had chosen a more Altmanesque approach whereby a whole group of characters would be given more or less equal weight as they made their way to journey's end. Here the focus is on the teenage couple unhappy rich girl (Kate Winslet) and working-class bohemian artiste (Leonardo DiCaprio). The problem with these usually fine actors is that too often their youthful brio seems forced, as if Cameron as director\/screenwriter is straining to point out their youth, their vitality, their exuberance, in contrast to Winslet's stuffy social set which disapproves of their alliance.

","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"2 August 2008","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" This is not a film about drugs, although they do feature heavily. In fact, you could perhaps argue that director Terry Gilliam's approach to the film makes such interpretations far too obvious; as the stylistic devises used to convey the feeling of prolonged intoxication becomes so overwhelming that we lose sight of Thompson's original message, if only for a brief period. Obviously, familiarity with Thompson's work and the two short sequences in which Gilliam punctuates the screaming, cartoon-like excesses with a pointed yearning and social critique brings the whole thing together; underlining the original spirit and intentions of the book and leaving us with that sense of overwhelming hope in the face of cultural and spiritual defeat. These were truly dark days, with everyone too busy getting high or getting lost to notice what was happening - not only in America, but all around the world - as the generation that had attempted to bring about a social change for the better got fat and rich and turned into their fathers. There's an inherent sadness in this idea that is captured perfectly by Thompson and expressed by his colourful alter-ego Raoul Duke, as he huddles over his typewriter in a Vegas hotel room reflecting on the great wave that promised so much, but delivered so little.Once we get past the drugs, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998) is clearly about the pursuit of the American dream; from liberty, freedom and creative expression in the most hollow and affected place in the universe - where the former spirit and defiance of the 60's generation has given way to apathy and self-loathing - to the blurring of fact and fiction, fantasy and reality; as a continual bombardment of creative excess and satirical abstraction captures that overwhelming sense of confusion, escape and pursuit that gives way to something that is part acid flashback, part Disney fantasia. We assume that Gilliam developed this tone as a way of appropriating the bizarre and iconic sketches of artist Ralph Steadman, whose illustrations in Thompson's work really define the world and the characters of the text. However, the way that Gilliam envisions the film not only attunes our mind to the perspective of these bloated, drug-fuelled characters, but creates an exaggerated sense of America at this point in time; reducing characters to caricatures, scenes to sketches and the overall feeling from period-piece polemic, to a mocking cartoon satire.It makes sense in the context of Gilliam's career and seems to capture very personal feelings for the director; an expatriate American who left his own country as the war in Vietnam began to escalate, and after almost twenty-years of documenting a cinema of dreams, found himself moving back to America with varied films like The Fisher King (1991) and 12 Monkeys (1995). If the latter gave us a depiction of America as a microcosm of insanity against a backdrop of post-apocalyptic despair, then Fear and Loathing gives us the prelude. Here, we find an introduction of peace and love hippie-revellers and earnest protesters washed away on an opening credit that drips, blood-like across the screen, as an eerie version of My Favourite Things from The Sound of Music (1965) plays on the soundtrack. It suggests the idea of American innocence on the road to inevitable destruction, as the next cut introduces two stoned criminals speeding down the desolate highway into the heart of the American dream. Again, the idea that the characters go searching for the American dream and find it in Las Vegas is satire at its most cruel and perverse; as the rutting lounge lizards and distorted faces of jaded hotel employees becomes a depiction, not of what the world would look like on drugs, but as a mere hint of what it might look like without them!With this in mind, Vegas becomes the ultimate setting; a great big pile of money in the middle of the desert dressed up with a plastic fantastic veneer that cries in the reverberated soulless soul of Elvis impersonators and Tom Jones. It is the one place in the world in which the magic and the landmarks of every great country is reduced to the level of a cheap icon to be bought and sold; that vision of America creating a culture from cannibalising the rest of the world and wallowing in phony glitz and glamour, where the only mark of success is how much money you arrive with, and how much you take home. In Gilliam's world the heat and hypocrisy of Vegas is overwhelming, but it never strays from farce. There's a humour here, more in keeping with The Simpsons than Fellini or Buñuel, as the character fumble and tumble about this exaggerated landscape amidst Gilliam's continually brilliant directorial touches and the revolving-door sideshow of supporting players and celebrity cameos. It also helps that the lead roles are filled by actors as talented and daring as Depp and Del Toro; who both thrown themselves into the spirit of the film and the shared vision of Thompson and Gilliam completely, to produce this random, rambling and at times completely ugly film that brims with character, imagination, vigour and intent.Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a bold work; one that takes on the ideas of Thompson's book and the satirical exaggerations of Steadman's sketches and creates a film that on the surface seems bright, colourful, screaming and surreal, but ultimately reveals a more thoughtful side that goes back to Thompson's comment on the changing American landscape of the early 1970's and that spirit and energy that burned so brightly only to extinguish itself at the first sign of defeat. Again, it's not a film about drugs, although they do feature heavily. Instead, Gilliam creates a portrait of America where the complete void of existence is filled by vices of over-indulgence (could be drugs, could be sex, could be television); and perhaps the last truly inspiring American film of the twentieth century.

Henry (Michael Rooker) is a kind of generic serial murderer. The movie was made just about at the height of the public's fascination with serial murderers. I suppose that's why this rather raw but not unintelligent film wound up with a title out of the junk bin and a musical score to match. The latter hits us over the head with a crowbar so that we don't miss the horrifying scenes of violence while we're chug-a-lugging energy drinks or playing grab-it with our teen-aged pals.Rooker, as Henry, is out of the slams and murdering people more or less at random when he looks up an old friend from Cell Block Eleven, Otis (Tom Towles), who is now on probation, and moves in with him. Towles has a face out of a Saturday-morning cartoon, all buck toothed and goggly eyed, as if he might have once been an endearingly odd-looking child. He's retained his juvenile appetites too.Poor Rooker doesn't look like an ex-child at all. He looks like our idea of a serial murderer. And with a suitably raspy voice. At any rate, he teaches Otis how much fun it is to murder strangers. It's even more fun when you steal a video camera and record the acts. The two of them sit on their shabby couch, getting hammered while watching the video, which Otis wants to continually replay.There's a girl in the picture too, Otis's sister, Becky (Tracy Arnold), a pleasant, trusting young blond who is on the run from an abusive husband now in jail. Becky develops a crush on Henry, who may be a bit inexpressive but not, after all, mean. Alas, Otis has an eye on his own sister and one night, when Henry return to find Otis raping Becky, he snuffs Otis in a most unpleasant manner, graphically displayed, disarticulates the cadaver, and disposes of it in the Chicago River in several Hefty Bags.Henry and Becky take to the road in the general direction of San Bernardino, where Henry has some prospects. I love you, Henry, confesses Becky. He replies, I guess I love you too. They pull into a cheap motel where Becky sits and plucks at Henry's guitar, saying she hopes things work out for them. Yeah. Well, I guess we'd better go to bed. Next morning we see Henry shaving with a straight razor. Then we watch Henry drive away alone in his old car. He pulls off the highway, opens the trunk, removes a sizable suitcase and leaves it in the winter-dried leaves at the side of the pavement before he drives away.

In fact the film is reasonably intelligent and apparently made for adults. Otis and Henry may cackle over the slaughter of a middle-class couple but the viewer does not. It's revolting. And the disposal of the innocent Becky so dispassionately by Henry, just after the two had apparently developed the simulacrum of a relationship, is especially sad.It's inexpensive but reasonably well developed.

The camera lingers on the shabby, stained suitcase, leaving us in no doubt of what's inside it, and the score, for a few blessed moments, is silent, with no sound other than the vehicles whizzing uncaringly past.It isn't spooky. The presentation of events is pretty matter of fact. No monster's point of view as Henry creeps up on his prey -- none of that kind of clichéd crap. In fact the film is reasonably intelligent and apparently made for adults. Otis and Henry may cackle over the slaughter of a middle-class couple but the viewer does not. It's revolting. And the disposal of the innocent Becky so dispassionately by Henry, just after the two had apparently developed the simulacrum of a relationship, is especially sad.It's inexpensive but reasonably well developed. Don't let the foolish title mislead you.

On the other hand, the obvious wholesomeness -- Nelson Eddy's game attempt at light romantic comedy and Susanna Foster's peaches-and-cream singing and acting -- are quickly cloying. However, for the sheer comforting pleasure of this great old story of a murderous, misunderstood madman at the Paris Opera, I prefer this version, as weak as it sometimes is, to the grand guignol of Lon Chaney's silent movie or the florid pomposity of Lloyd-Webber's turgid musical. Why? Because it is satisfying fun without uber- drama or much meaning. Does anyone not know the story? Probably not, so we'll pass that by. What other pleasures does this movie hold besides a great romantic and melodramatic story and the most threatening chandelier in Paris? There's that lush Technicolor look that shows off with rich color the sets, the costumes and the complexions of the actors. Claude Raines as Enrique Claudin gives a touchingly mad performance as a humble violinist who wrote a great concerto and who fell hopelessly in love with Christine Dubois (Susanna Foster), a beautiful young soprano for whom he beggared himself secretly paying for her vocal lessons. Eddy, as Anatole Garron, the star baritone at the Opera, and Edgar Barrier as Raoul D'Aubert, a senior officer with the Surete, are amusing as the Mutt and Jeff competitors for Susanna Foster's favors. The ornate and gilded stage set of the interior of the Opera gives movie quality a new meaning. And the dark, dank, damp catacombs beneath the Opera, reached by slimy stone steps and lit only by guttering candles in hand-held lanterns, are just part of the shivers in store for those foolish enough to follow the Phantom to his lair. There is also the deep, black lake of despair and the music, drifting down from another world. Or, as Claudin describes it to Christine, You'll love it here when you get used to the dark. And you'll love the dark, too. It's friendly and peaceful. It brings rest and relief from pain. It's right under the Opera. The music comes down and the darkness distills it, cleanses it of the suffering that made it. Then it's all beauty. And life here is like a resurrection. Raines was such a fine actor he could make Claudin a tragically sympathetic character. I'm sure Christine would have been persuaded if she'd only stopped screaming.

It is the 6th highest rated film on IMDb. The critics loved it, and the Internet is flooded with reviews where people rave about being deeply moved or touched.Ultimately, the film is a shallow failure.A good drama film needs several qualities. Of these, the most important is the exposition of characters and their interactions. Schindler's List flops spectacularly in this respect. We start out following the tale of Oskar Schindler, an opportunistic, profiteering businessman. But midpoint in the film, this Schindler persona has disappeared, and we have a new character clothed in the same flesh -- a self-sacrificing philanthropist who spends his entire amassed fortune to save the Jew workers. How did we get from one to the other? How did Schindler transform from the evil Mr. Hyde to the benevolent Dr. Jekyll? Steven Spielberg certainly doesn't show us -- maybe it happens via magic, like the bicycle ride in ET?And what about Amon Göth, the representative Nazi? A grotesque caricature if there ever was one. He's an evil, sadistic, Jew-hating Nazi bastard -- but do we get to know why he wakes up every morning, takes a swig of booze and snipes Jew prisoners for fun? No. Spielberg thinks the answer is obvious -- he's a Nazi, and Nazis don't have reasons for the things they do. They're just rabid dogs out for blood, utterly devoid of any moral dimension. But this sort of shallow political correctness can't possibly cut any slack with intelligent viewers. We want to know why Göth hates the Jews so much that he fires his pistol into a pile of decimated corpses, but we never get to know. Apparently, he does it because he's an Evil Nazi, and that's all there is to it.The attempt to add depth to Göth's character by dwelling on his twisted love affair with a Jewish girl is easily seen for what it is -- a cheap exposure of Nazi hypocrisy. How about trying to dwell on real issues here, Spielberg? How about trying to pass these people off as genuine (albeit twisted) human beings?This shortcoming is not restricted to Spielberg. When will Hollywood own up to the fact that the men who ran the Third Reich were not mindless monsters? Some of them were cultivated intellectuals and scientists, others compassionate family men and devoted friends. Germany was the best educated country in Europe when the Nazis rose to power. The true intrigue of the Holocaust does not lie in the brutality, but rather in Hannah Arendt's banality of evil. How can a man (or millions of men) arbitrarily narrow the moral sphere to exclude people seemingly no different from neighbours, friends and family? How can a man fall under the sway of a dispassionate and cruel ideology while leading a normal life of compassion?Needless to say, none of these issues are explored by Spielberg.Another peeve of mine Accents. There are English-speaking films and then there are German-speaking films. Schindler's List, on the other hand, does not belong to either of these categories. Instead, Spielberg opted to have the characters speak English with a German accent. What the hell? Listening to Liam Neeson strut about trying to sound like an Anglicised German is just pathetic.  Spielberg's trying to please Hollywood audiences by making the film accessible to them (and hence, no spoken German), but for the love of God! We get the point! They're in Nazi Germany. Yes, Hitler's in charge. Yes, it's a nasty, genocidal regime. Please, no cheesy accents.One of the truly unforgivable aspects of the film is the ending. A mildly touching speech by Schindler about being a war criminal on the run, wanted by the victors of the war, set just the right mood. It would have been perfect. But no, Spielberg couldn't resist messing it up -- he had to have Schindler break down, bawl and cry, grief-stricken and lashed by pangs of conscience. Spare me the anguish, Spielberg. The grief should have been that of the Jews, not Schindler.When Schindler took off his gold ring and blubbers out I could have saved one more, I experienced a feeling of mild revulsion. Look, the guy did a great job, he saved a lot of lives. No point in getting all worked up about the fact that he didn't literally sell the skin of his back to save people he didn't know.What does this film leave us after 195 minutes of running time? Let's see* The Nazis were *Really Evil* * There was a man called Schindler who didn't care about anything but money at first, and then for some reason he started to care about saving the Jews.Brilliant, Spielberg. Positively brilliant.All of the above-mentioned flaws are bad enough -- but the way the film manipulates the viewer really takes the cake. Shots of emaciated, shaved potential Holocaust victims starving and screaming, with tragic violin music to boot. It has been done in many films before, and will be done again. It doesn't take skill for a film-maker to coerce the viewer into sorrow -- It takes skill to produce the same feelings without resorting to cheap, melodramatic trickery. The Pianist is a superb counter-example. A journey of the mind is so much more satisfying than a journey of the senses...Like most of Spielberg's films, Schindler's List is technically outstanding. It captures the mood of wartime Germany perfectly. The sets, costumes and cinematography are all top-notch, and the acting is not too bad either. However, none of these things can overcome the fact that Spielberg is a director of extremely limited vision.

He packs a gun, gets in barroom brawls, battles sinister foreigners and has a love\/hate romance with a beautiful, feisty woman, who will stand no guff from anyone. He investigates mysterious ancient tombs, rescues the spunky heroine, and has to deal with skeptical university\/museum officials back in the States, who refuse to fund any more of his expeditions.George Zucco is in superb form as the elegant, sly, understated villain, almost purring his lecherous remarks to the lovely heroine, Peggy Moran. Cecil Kellaway is quite amusing as Moran's well-meaning but somewhat scatterbrained magician father, and Wallace Ford manages to be fairly funny most of the time, though probably some of the comic relief could have been lessened.It's an odd experience to see actor Tom Tyler in an old western movie predating The Mummy's Hand by eight years or so, and recognize the face of the ill fated Egyptian Prince in the flashback sequences as the same cowboy hero wearing a stetson hat in assorted B westerns. Rumor has it that Tyler got the part of Kharis the Mummy because the studio thought he resembled Boris Karloff enough to pass in the Ancient Egypt parts of the movie.This movie is a lot of fun for anyone who enjoys old movies and Forties humor, which it has in abundance. Not really a horror movie in the true sense, though the Mummy himself is pretty frightening, but an adventure mystery thriller, with a strong undertone of comedy. The tavern brawl is a rowdy highlight of the movie, as knife wielding villains attack our heroes, and Dick Foran clobbers several of the bad guys, while the nattily dressed Cecil Kellaway swats at them with his walking stick, as he attempts to escape by a window.

The tavern brawl is a rowdy highlight of the movie, as knife wielding villains attack our heroes, and Dick Foran clobbers several of the bad guys, while the nattily dressed Cecil Kellaway swats at them with his walking stick, as he attempts to escape by a window.

The handsome, rugged, genial archaeologist played by Dick Foran could be a great uncle to Harrison Ford's character. He packs a gun, gets in barroom brawls, battles sinister foreigners and has a love\/hate romance with a beautiful, feisty woman, who will stand no guff from anyone. He investigates mysterious ancient tombs, rescues the spunky heroine, and has to deal with skeptical university\/museum officials back in the States, who refuse to fund any more of his expeditions.George Zucco is in superb form as the elegant, sly, understated villain, almost purring his lecherous remarks to the lovely heroine, Peggy Moran. Cecil Kellaway is quite amusing as Moran's well-meaning but somewhat scatterbrained magician father, and Wallace Ford manages to be fairly funny most of the time, though probably some of the comic relief could have been lessened.It's an odd experience to see actor Tom Tyler in an old western movie predating The Mummy's Hand by eight years or so, and recognize the face of the ill fated Egyptian Prince in the flashback sequences as the same cowboy hero wearing a stetson hat in assorted B westerns.

The original Universal Mummy feature opens as you might expect it to- a field expedition in 1921 Egypt discovers some ancient scrolls etc. etc. etc. This part is entertaining especially if you enjoy the adventure genre, but we've all seen it before. Once the plot moves away from Egypt, however, there is no lumbering bandaged corpse, instead we get a wrinkled Boris Karloff (solid makeup job, incidentally) and a movie that aside from some creepy moments seems more inclined to tell a story about loneliness, long-lost love, obsession, and history coming back to haunt us than what you might expect from a monster movie. Although several Universal films in the 40's would also steer clear of the traditional monster movie setup, The Mummy, coming after Dracula and James Whale's excellent Frankenstein, is quite radically different from the studio's previous talkie horror films.Karl Freund directs the film awkwardly in places but also succeeds in evoking quite a bit emotionally as well as creating fantastic atmosphere (the latter is to be expected of classic Universal horror films, of course). The aspect of the film which really shines, outside of the excellent acting from Karloff and Johann, is the script, and while Frankenstein was a better film on a technical level, The Mummy features one of few truly great screenplays for Universal horror films. It's an interesting, moving portrait of a man rather than a simplistic monster romp, and it is truly outstanding.If you come to The Mummy expecting a typical, fun monster movie you might actually find it a bit hard to sit through.
