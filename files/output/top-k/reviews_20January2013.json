Taking place in the 1970's, this film was able to do something that most rock movies struggle to do-maintain a level of sincerity that balances out with the glamorous stories of rock stars. The film is about a boy named William Miller that is soon to graduate high school at the age of fifteen, and dreams of becoming a music journalist. After a piece he wrote for an underground magazine catches the attention of Rolling Stone magazine, he is sent on a trip to travel with one of the next big rock bands, Stillwater (a fictional band created for the purposes of the movie). William is plunged into a world of sex, drugs, and of course, some of the best music in history.I think the reason why this film did an incredible job of not seeming totally contrived was because this is actually based off of a true story. The film is the semi-autobiography of the writer\/director, Cameron Crowe. Also, the actors were phenomenal, especially Kate Hudson as groupie Penny Layne and Patrick Fugit as William.And of course, the soundtrack was perfection, comprised of songs by The Who, Led Zeppelin, Elton John, and other great 70's rock bands.

Its not the story itself that is so compelling in the film. Its mainly the direction and acting of Mel Gibson, who absolutely masters both aspects to one of the greatest films ever made.The film itself is beautiful in every single aspect. All the supporting cast did a fantastic job and each made their character be as real as possible. The guy playing King Edward Longshanks does such a great job making sure you totally despise the character in every way. Mel Gibson's portrayal of William Wallace is one of the finest and most professional acting I've seen.The musical score to the film is very beautiful, further adding to the incredible brilliance of the film. The cinematography shots around Scotland were breathtaking. In fact, it is Braveheart's brilliance of cinematography that ensured masterpieces such as Lord of the Rings would follow the same trail.The moment the film really started, I absolutely loved two things about it. The musical score and the breathtaking cinematography! The start of the film where we see swooping shots through mountains is so breathtaking that from here on in, I loved the whole film.Though a few of the fight scenes now may look a little aged, and a little disappointing, which is my ONLY minor concern, they are certainly watchable and I enjoyed MOST of them. The action in Braveheart is what brings us the action in Gladiator, Lord of the Rings, Troy, 300 and so on.Braveheart in short, is nothing less than a masterpiece. It exceeds every aspect that a film should by including brilliant performances to relate to characters, breathtaking music, great direction and superb cinematography.

Directed in a fashion that aptly recalls classic Hollywood story-telling of the 20's and 30's, it relates its fable of the rise, fall and rise again of The Natural, the man with no past, Roy Hobbs, played handsomely, in more ways than one by Robert Redford. Only of course we do know his past, as shown in the prologue which introduces Hobbs and his exceptional talent, brutally curtailed following a moral misjudgement, the outcome of which delays his entry to the big league by some 17 years.Luckily, Redford can carry off looking 20 as required in the first 15 minutes, when he first shows his talent, albeit in pitching, with an encounter with a thinly disguised Babe Ruth, played with gusto by Joe Don Baker. When he returns years later to make his destiny in the sport, he comes across the usual distractions of sleazy journalism, shady financiers and of course, loose women, before he gets a wake-up call just in time from his true love and gives the ending the story deserves, even as I understand it contradicts that of the source novel.Shot in appropriately golden light and strongly played by most of the principals, the only weak link being Kim Basinger as the scheming sex-pot out to turn his head, this is an exciting and emotionally engaging story. Perhaps the villains of the piece could have been drawn a shade darker and Robert Duvall is slightly underused as the scheming journalist scenting a story, but a young Glenn Close is just right as the grown-up girl Hobbs left behind, whose eleventh-hour revelation inspires his final act.Director Levinson pulls out the stops for the big set-piece climaxes on the field as Redford serves up the clichés of hitting the cover off the ball and stopping the clocks, before literally lighting the lights at the conclusion. He thus invests the sport with the near-mythical symbolism its devoted supporters claim as its due and I for one am not about to deny them.In a crowded market-place, this has to be one of the best sporting films ever, while I hold my breath waiting for a major movie about cricket.

Immediately after watching this, I was a bit disappointed. This is not to say this wasn't a good work of cinema, which it is, but guess I am a victim of The Over-hype. After a few hours when I pondered upon my experience, the cinematic excellence of this classic dawned upon me. It is not as smart and hard-hitting like my other Martin Scorsese's favorites (The Departed, Gangs of New York), but this one grows on you. This film had it all - good starcast (its all about Robert Di Nero), good camera-work, strong script to work with, nice editing to tie-up the movie, apt music which added to the element of the movie (as intended by the director) and of course, strong direction to bring it all together.The first aspect that impressed me was the way story was portrayed by Mr.Martin Scorsese. If you actually look at it, this is just another story about a disturbed Nam marine who is back and is trying to adjust to his life post coming back from war. He is a loner, disturbed and wants to clean the streets cowboy-style. It could very-well have ended as just another action flick. But Mr.Scorsese had other plans. The movie started with the new york streets and how filthy \/ busy they are. At the same time, no shot was particularly stretched - it was all shot in passing, like a dream. The continuous shots of the streetlights and the traffic signals was actually very psychedelic, as if on drugs . The saxophone music, while adding a touch of classic element, was making the viewer very comfortable, as if watching in half sleep. Now I realize that it was all because this was how the protagonist was feeling - he could not sleep (insomnia). What a wonderful way to invite the viewer right in the midst of the protagonist's life ! It feels like I was made to be the cab passenger of Travis's taxi and I watched everything from the back seat. Cinematic excellence at its best !Travis (Robert Di Nero) has been shown to be very eccentric with a quirky sense of humour, which was very rusty at times. His character (disturbed war hero) demanded such confused feelings and reactions. One of the best performances by Mr.Robert Di Nero (Raging Bull with Scorsese being another noteworthy one). You Looking at me? will always be an iconic phrase for all times to come.This review would not be complete without the mention of Bernard Herrmann's background score. The soundtrack brings out the central theme of the movie in the viewer's mind - loneliness and at times its absolutely terrifying. Deserves a special mention.In summary, this movie could have been categorized as action\/crime but Mr.Scorsese made it a drama\/crime movie and portrayed a strong nightmarish experience.

There are some classic, must see films that are worth seeing, just to be able to claim that you have seen them, such as Airplane. But Rocky is not one such film. It tells the story of a low-level enforcer for a small time loan shark. He makes his money shaking people down and boxing on weekends for a few dollars per fight. He then forces himself on his best friend's sister, punches animal carcasses, and tries to win a fight against the world champion.For a film about boxing, there is basically none. A few seconds at the beginning, that show that Rocky is a boxer. Then there is nothing until the final few minutes. The film is 116 minutes long. What a joke. The dialogue? It is dreadful. Rocky's best friend just randomly shouts and goes into massive rage tantrums for basically no reason, Rocky is barely intelligible, and his girlfriend basically says nothing. Apollo Creed is meant to come across as some massive ass hole who only cares about the big show, but whenever he is on screen you barely even pay attention to him enough to notice.The whole scene where Rocky practically begs Adrienne do come in, then corners her against the wall and forces her to kiss him is one of the most rapey things I have ever seen. They have zero chemistry. I am just upset that I wasted the time to watch it. The only reason it doesn't get 1\/10 is because the day may come when I have to review the sequels, so I need to save that spot.

As my Uncle Al used to say, Kid, that's why Mister Ford makes 'em in a lot of different colors now.My late father was a lyricist back in the days of Tin Pan Alley; he sold his first song lyric before he was twenty, and he spent his entire life delighting in, and making his living with, his imagination. He treasured imaginative ways of telling stories, and I guess that's why I married a poet. I will forgive an otherwise uninspired movie if it offers an imaginative and unusual way of thinking about an idea.Art, like religion, is a cultural universal; every society on earth makes art. In homogeneous cultures, and in all totalitarian societies, artistic orthodoxy is highly valued. The more diverse a culture becomes, the more tolerant it becomes of subversive art. The American film industry today is the most diverse in the world. Instead of an unchanging stream of movies glorifying the fatherland or the revolution, we Americans, or at least some of us, have been entertained by the animated fantasy of Walt Disney, the profound vision of Orson Welles, and even the as-yet-immature imagination of Jack Baran. Who's Jack Baran? I'm coming to that.One of my father's favorite songs was Johnny Mercer and Harold Arlen's That Old Black Magic, which contains the line, You're the mate that fate had me created for. And that's what DESTINY TURNS ON THE RADIO, directed by Jack Baran, is all about, a comedic fable about luck or fate or destiny, and the mythology that our culture has constructed around it. It's not a new idea, but it's an interesting idea, and it's more interesting to me than whether the good guy will get the bad guy before he blows up another building. The fact that young Jack Baran didn't quite pull it off is forgivable.DESTINY TURNS ON THE RADIO was written by two young graduates of Robert Redford's Sundance Institute, which supports independent filmmaking, that is, movies not driven by the major studios and their commercial formulas for box-office success. Well, they certainly avoided formulas. They've also avoided box-office success. I saw this movie twice the week it opened, and I can say for a fact that at least four other people in my town also saw it because they were in the theater with me.I found DESTINY TURNS ON THE RADIO to be provocative, witty and entertaining, but I surely can see why it's not everyone's cup of tea. Its theatrical colloquy and supernatural premise combine to create a script that probably reads a lot better than it plays. The incongruity between the theme and the characters demands an extreme suspension of disbelief, something most film-goers are simply not willing to do. So what's to like? Well, I liked this movie because it appealed to me like a quirky short story by P. G. Wodehouse, lightweight but clever. I liked it because James LeGros does a terrific job in a supporting role. I also liked it because Nancy Travis sings That Old Black Magic in a scene that had me tripping over my tongue.I guess what I'm saying is that I liked DESTINY TURNS ON THE RADIO because I think my father would have liked it. It is an imaginative first effort from a bunch of young filmmakers, and investing in it was an act of courage. And evidently, for many people, so was sitting through it.

Not The Beatles, not the Stones, but the Doors' raw, controversial track, The End. We learn who Willard is, and over a really unnerving tape, about who Kurtz is. Or may be. There are beautiful shots of vast forests and mountains, more intimate walks through the jungle and of the river, brilliant lighting of characters, horrifyingly beautiful sets with hanging bodies, ancient ruins and bizarre alters. The sound quality is without a doubt the greatest in film. Apocalypse Now is more than a film with a plot and an idea, it's an experience. No credits, no titles. Nothing to distract.And in the end, what does it come to? Knowledge, perspective, accidental strength from the weakness of others. What, where is freedom? It isn't spelt out exactly what the intent is, but there are several, and having knowledge of the source material is a huge help.A second chance is one of the biggest rewards I'v ever given myself. To experience Apocalypse Now again, in a new light, is an experience I needed. An amazing piece of art. 9.7\/10 ","genre":"Drama, War"},{"date":"20 January 2013","score":"4 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" As we all know Disney was running through some difficult times through the late 70's and 80's. Their movies weren't incredibly original or interesting and The Great Mouse Detective happens to be one of their last mediocre films. However this movie did help Disney after the failure of the Black Cauldron. While the movie was mediocre it used some new technologies and helped the creation of newer\/better Disney films. Now I know a lot of people who watched this movie as a kid love it and consider it a really good movie but let's take a step back and look at the movie for what it is.The movie follows a mouse detective named Basil who is trying to find a kidnapped toy maker. However this toy maker's daughter comes along with him as well as Basil's new assistant who plays the role of Watson from Sherlock Holmes. Basically Basil is trying to figure out what his nemesis Ratigan is up to and what kind of scheme he is hatching.The movie follows The Sherlock Holmes formula very closely and even makes many references to Sherlock Holmes which I thought was funny (Baker Street, Basil being named after the actor who portrayed Sherlock Holmes, a man in the window of 221 Baker Street playing a violin and others). Being a fan of Sherlock Holmes I have watched almost all of the original Sherlock TV shows. And honestly who doesn't like a good mystery? This is where the movie starts to have problems. There is no mystery.The movie pretends to be a detective movie but the problem is that the villain and his entire plan are revealed at the very beginning so there is no mystery. Younger audiences might take a couple minutes longer to figure out what Ratigan's plan is but it is still very obvious. Here is the next problem with the conflict Ratigan is as cliché as cliché gets. We know nothing about Ratigan's motives, his back-story, his inner thoughts, or any development in his character other than being a villain. He is dull and one dimensional with no redeeming characteristics until the last two minutes of his life. One thing that really bothered me was his legs... he walks like a woman and his legs are always bent inward at such an incredible angle that it looks really awkward. Also he has a henchman\/bat who is just embarrassing. It's a bat with a peg leg that always switches what foot it is on and he is simply a comedy relief.Now the main characters aren't all that bad. Basil is as interesting as any version of Sherlock Holmes. He doesn't do anything incredibly different from being another Sherlock Holmes other than him being a mouse. I have watched so much of Sherlock Holmes movies and TV shows it is hard to say that Basil is original or unique. People who haven't seen any Sherlock Holmes movies probably thought Wow he is so witty, clever, original and doesn't even have a love interest but actually his character has been so many times. Dawson is much like Watson but doesn't have as many redeeming features as Watson. The little girl who follows them around is named Olivia and she is pretty much your generic wide-eyed eight year old animated mouse. She doesn't differentiate herself from the cliché character that she is which leads to another problem this movie has it is incredibly cliché and just feels like another mouse movie. A lot of parents have probably noticed the rather mature aspects of this movie such as the suggestive themes at the bar and the violence in the movie. Honestly there isn't anything real bad about putting this kind of content in a kids' movie but what is bad is when it is poorly executed. The bar scene could've been from just about any movie that features are bar. It was cliché, generic, unoriginal, and had nothing to separate it from the large number of bar scenes in other movies. The movie does feature two songs one extremely simplistic song about Ratigan praising himself and another incredibly simplistic song at the bar where a lady mouse is on stage and is singing about suggestive material. Both of these songs are overly simple, aren't catchy, and were very quickly produced due to their simplicity. Once again the movie proves to not be anything different from an average movie.There are a couple of good aspects about this movie. The soundtrack itself is not bad and is actually good at certain times. It has this nice vibe to it which I really liked. Also one thing that really surprised me about this movie is how dramatically the animation changed from the beginning to the end of the movie. The entire movie's animation is just standard but then the last several minutes of the movie (which are inside Big Ben) are excellently animated and look a lot more fluid and crisp. Probably the most important thing that this movie accomplished happened inside Big Ben and that is the use of CGI in an animated movie. This movie helped Disney incorporate CGI into a hand drawn movie to help make an incredibly complex scene. Also at the very end Ratigan FINALLY becomes threatening and interesting. In truth the ending is the reason why people even remember this movie.The Great Mouse Detective may not be a great Disney movie but it is important to Disney's history. It will definitely entertain kids who aren't looking for a character driven or original movie. Probably the main reason why this movie is so simplistic is because of its predecessor which is the Black Cauldron. Audiences didn't like the Black Cauldron due to it not being kid friendly or simplistic. So what does Disney do? They make an incredibly simplistic, linear, kid friendly, and unoriginal movie to capture the audience it lost. Thanks for reading.

This was literally the first time I have seen it just moments ago and as the first half hour or so passed, I felt a sinking in my stomach. It wasn't grasping me, it wasn't blowing me away like Gone With The Wind did for the first time. Parts of it felt very dated, especially much of the dialogue between the supporting cast members. They all spoke (especially the children in the film) like 1940's gangsters. I know it was almost 1940 but they aren't supposed to be gangsters. Maybe it was a slang style of speech but it was overwhelming and little cheesy. They used the term seee more than a dozen times I swear. Then Mr. Smith begins to understand the corruption going on, then comes the epic cinematically historical filibuster and I was riveted to my chair while Jimmy Stewart pounds home his message in one of the most powerful scenes in movie history. The first half of the film dragged and didn't draw me in, but the latter half was the meat and potatoes and made this nearly everything I expected it to be. The first half of the film really delves into what is happening but I felt like it perhaps went into too much detail establishing the various characters than was necessary.Jimmy Stewart plays the iconic Mr. Smith. He definitely does not hit his stride with this character until the latter half of the film. He is deserving of his Oscar nomination because of the intense emotion and power he brings to the closing scene. Up until then he lacks something I felt. He was supposed to be a fish way out of water and he does that but without much flare. Jean Arthur is decent in her role, though her performance was one of those ones that felt very dated in her dialogue. Her chemistry with Stewart was good but I think I wanted more closure to their romance that never really blossoms into something else. Claude Rains is excellent in his performance. The chemistry between him and Stewart is terrific and when Mr. Smith discovers Rains' betrayal you literally feel the pain that would have caused. Edward Arnold is perfect as the pompous gangster type man controlling the senators from the unnamed state. He doesn't have a lot of screen time and his character is a little stereotypical but it fits the role fine. Thomas Mitchell has a small but important role as the reporter who fights for Smith's cause behind the scenes. I would have liked to have seen more from his character because he was fun and charismatic in his scenes. The film has an enormous supporting cast basically being all of the senators and the house leaders. They are all good in their roles and very believable at each step of the way. It's A Wonderful Life fans and Capra fans will recognize some of the actors from the iconic Christmas film.This is only the second Frank Capra film I have seen so I can't really speak too much on his style considering the man is a legend. This film is definitely appealing to the people and is chock full of the emotion of hope and determination for the underdog. Certainly he doesn't hide his opinion that Washington is full of corruption and perhaps even has something to say about the way Washington does its business which I don't think has changed all that much in a lot of ways. Many reviews and things I read talk about how Capra made a film for the everyman about Washington and the process and while obviously the success of the film proves that I did think it was actually very complex in some ways. His lack of mentioning parties and the actual state they were from made it a little hard to follow at times but the message still comes home. The film is a legendary classic and I don't presume to tell anyone whats good and bad about it because everyone should watch this type of film. I liked it a lot and the latter half of the movie will just rivet you to you seat. It wasn't one of my favourites but it is a must see. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"20 January 2013","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is one of those iconic classic films that I was scared to review.
