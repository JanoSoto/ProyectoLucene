Wow.When I first heard that Disney was doing a version of the Tarzan story, I was hesitant.  I mean who wants to hear an ape man spouting out show tunes? Hakuna Matata!  The only songs are some of the best work Phil Collins has done in many years.  He ventures into the Peter Gabriel territory, but does a great job especially with the rhythms since he IS a drummer.  The open number (and sequence) is best albeit Lion King-esque.  It seems he was very inspired by the material and has rediscovered his love of music.  It's very uplifting.  Don't misunderstand me, the characters do sing, but it's more Rosie O'Donnell doing scat with the other apes as they destroy a camp and a very welcome singing cameo by Glenn Close doing the beginning of a lullaby that Phil takes over.As for the picture itself  wow!  This is the most beautiful Disney animation ever  lush, detailed, quick and smooth.  Tarzan moves like liquid, filling the screen with gymnastic ease especially the scene where he fights a leopard to save his ape family.And family is what this film is all about.  Disney's Tarzan makes a different decision that Edgar Rice Burroughs' and I think it works better, but it's the decision I would make in the same situation.  Some of the situations are a little contrived, but it is mostly Disney sticking with a winning formula.  (Tarzan does have nipples unlike Aladdin).  -)  What surprised me was the dramatic tilt of the film. Rosie O'Donnell's ape and the elephant are the only comic relief and don't have much of it.  The film is very skewed towards adults; HOWEVER, as I was surrounded by a mob of kids there was dead silence right after the main gorillas lose their baby and Tarzan loses his parents to the leopard at the beginning.  All the questioning ceased and I got to enjoy the film in complete adult-like silence.  The kids were just as wrapped up in the movie as the adults.The voice talent was well cast, too.  Minnie Driver is great as the strong, yet proper British lady of the time.  Her father is a stereotypical egghead professor who is as clumsy as he is smart.  And then there is Brian Blessed as the villain, Clayton.  Man, do I love his voice! It's the Voice of God!  The deep, rich tones always give me a chill.  I wish he worked in more films other then Kenneth Kenneth Branagh's Shakespeare films, but alas.... (well, I guess he WAS in The Phantom Menace)This truly is one of Disney's classics.  I felt the same way walking out of this one as I did from Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King.Oh, look for a cameo from Mrs. Potts and Chip from Beauty and the Beast!  I thought it was funny, but I don't think anyone else in the theater got it since I seemed to be the only one laughing.   I always embarrass myself at the movies it seems.

I had no problem with its lack of plot; much like an action movie is all action and no character, this movie is all character and no action.  And this, I am certain, is the way the makers intended it to be, or they wouldn't have had dialogue in 95% of the movie.  In any case, Seinfeld was immensely popular (though I actually did not like it), and it never had a plot.  And to me, its characters were exceedingly more disgusting, despicable, and immoral than the characters in this movie.Yes, some of the characters were selfish, pretentious, manipulative, and otherwise possessing negative traits; in fact, none of these characters was without flaws.  But neither are any of us, and most of us would probably not be willing to acknowledge that we or our friends possess some of the abhorrent characteristics.  I know that I have met more than one person who behaves like Charlotte, and have been on the receiving end of such behavior. And no, I don't like Charlotte, any more than I like the people who have treated me like crap in real life.  But why should all characters be likable? It is true that if you find all of these characters without merit, then this movie would suck.  But I did not dislike all of these characters. I understand Alice very well, and while I have not seen any other movie Chloe Sevigny has been in, I saw the acting that others call wooden as very true to the character she was playing.  Alice is supposed to be timid and uncertain about everything (which sometimes caused he not to say much, and perhaps appear stupid in some people's minds), etc, etc.  I do agree that she was very uninteresting for the first bit of the movie, seemingly just following Charlotte around like a puppy, but when her true character is revealed, I think her wallpaper act is quite appropriate to her personality.Even those characters I found morally repugnant, like Des and Charlotte, I still could understand them and have some small sense of sympathy for people trying to be good but being bogged down by their own self-absorption.  I also liked Mackenzie Astin in this movie, even though he didn't get to do much; what is a bit disconcerting is that he still looks so much like he did when he was on The Facts of Life when he was about 12.  In too many movies, the protagonists are all simply good and the antagonists are all plain bad; I do like movies that have flat characters, but it is nice to see a movie where the characters are more tangible and don't seem like something out of a fairy tale.At the very least, this movie showed that not only bad people get STDs. In most movies, such things are not discussed, and if they are, it is always the slimy characters that have the STD (unless it's a movie about AIDS), which is hardly the way it works in real life.  To show a sweet, perhaps naive, girl like Alice who gets a little something extra the very first time she has sex sends a certain message about knowing people and their sexual history before you sleep with them, without coming off as horribly preachy.This movie is about real people; so what if the setting wasn't accurate (though I have no idea myself if this is the case) or the songs weren't current? And some people do talk like that- believe those of us who have met them.  And even if it was played up a little bit- hey, it's a movie.

I won't really get into the story, because that is not really what we want to read here.  But what I will say is what I thought was good and what wasn't so good, and unfortunately the bad much outweighs the good.  First the good.I liked the lighting in the film.  It was lit beautifully to make you feel like you were walking onto the set of a horror film, and with the subject matter, it may as well have been a horror film.  Rape is a brutal crime and this rape was a step beyond almost any rape I have known about in any film with maybe the exception of DePalma's Casualties Of War.  But back to the lighting.  The use of shadows in this film were great.  And if you want to get all deep about it, the shadows were a metaphor for the truth behind this crime.  You may think you know and understand what happened to this poor girl, but there is always something else lurking in the shadows.The other element of this film that I enjoyed was James Woods and how his scenes were written with John Travolta.  I think this is some of his best work since  The Specialist  with Stallone.  But his psychological bantering with Travolta was pure joy.  If it wasn't for my memories of their encounters together, I may have enjoyed the film even less than I did.The other good thing about the film is some of the humour.  There is one particular line in the film where Travolta describes what precautionary measures one must do in this day and age before engaging in sexual intercourse that had me laughing for at least five minutes after the joke was over.  That joke alone is worth the price of a matinee ( here in London Ont. that is $5.25 ).But the rest of the movie is hollow.  There are many areas that don't seem to go anywhere and the film is ultimately unsatisfying at it's conclusion. First of all I don't but the killers identity and his reasons for committing the crime.  There is a much more logical killer and he is only implicated partially in the film.  Secondly there is no heroic ending.  By the end of this film, you want someone to pay dearly for what has happened to the girl who was killed.  And instead of getting visuals of the perpetrator being arrested and some cool line by Travolta to add grit to it, instead we are left with only a small written explanation as to what happens to this individual.  And that was frustrating.  Also unnecessary and quite trite was the affair that happened years ago between Travolta and Stowe.  This plot device was put in the film simply to give them something to talk about when they weren't investigating the case.  That is a sign of a weak screenplay.This movie had potential to be a good thriller, but it was maybe two steps behind and the story could have maybe gone through one more draft to tighten things up.  All in all I was rather disappointed.

Graphically astounding, but plot-wise it leaves a lot to be desired. In the year of 1999 the cast looks unbelievably seventies, and the movie is utterly un-rewatchable (if you can say such a thing), as the initial scares are long gone. Awesome movie because its so graphically perverse. The whole alien-popping-out-of-chest thing was unwatchable, kudos to John Hurt for that. Fabulous movie in its time.Aliens = All-out americanised highly enjoyable action flick, taking the usual american sequel-recipe (make it bigger and louder) to new heights. Adds a new alien design and the whole hive-structure thing to the aliens. The queen looks bloody retarded, a caricature of Giger's original alien designs. The reason this movie seems to be the number one of the trilogy is simply because its so incredibly easy to understand. The soundtrack is simple, the plot is simple (actually), the characters are fantastically simple (and therefore easily likeable) and they packed in a lil annoying kid too (although it added a good touch to the plot) that does nothing but get into trouble and gets saved a lot. Bleargh.A cliched simple action movie sporting fat designs and a dark, brooding industrial-type sci-fi atmosphere, but still graphically nothing compared to the first movie.Alien3 = This is pure depression, despair, anger, realism. It takes the whole we can take them on feeling you got after a while in Aliens and slams it through the pavement. Without our big guns and fancy technology us humans are really nothing but a bunch of treacherous gits. Apart from the first obvious plot hole (the alien egg), which was absolutely necessary anyway if there was going to be a second sequel, the plot stands out as the cleanest of the lot. Its deeper, more terrifying than Alien, and infinitely more sophisticated than Aliens. We see the new dog alien (cleaning up the question wether aliens take on their hosts physique) and we see how dark and terrible the world of Alien really is. The imagery is fantastic, sometimes almost like a painting, mostly browns and reds and fabulous camera angles. The scene where the candles along the ground get blown out is like icecubes down my spine, and the first glimpse of the alien is awe-inspiring.

Ahh this movie is fabulous. Alien resurrection is disowned from the series in my eyes, it shows too much. This movie is awesome, it shows just enough. Alien = Stranger, new, different, unknown. Aliens managed to hide the aliens well enough, and alien3 finishes off perfectly. David Fincher is a sheer visual genius.This is a 100% good movie.

If they think it'll be a black comedy like Heathers, they are also gonna get a nasty surprise, since it's waaaay more dark and gruesome and mean. It's stupid that they are advertising it as If you liked Something About Mary, you'll Love... they are both tasteless comedies, but VBT makes SAM look like a Disney movie in comparison. Yeah, there's disgusting stuff in SAM but it's all vulgar sex-related humor, but in VBT the humor is in the vein (har!) of Mia Wallace getting the hypo of adrenaline jabbed into her heart in Pulp Fiction. Hey, I like that kind of humor, so I liked this movie, though the misogynism got a little old. I rented it because a friend said he admired the filmmakers for making such an incredibly nasty, mean-spirited mainstream movie, and it was an OK movie worth a rental. It seems like most of the reviewers here either loved it or despised it (YOU BETTER STOP SELLING IT) but I would give it, like, a B minus. Christian Slater's self-actualization psycho act got old after a while but the other actors were good, and I think Cameron Diaz is overrated in general but I really liked her performance in this, she was great as the spoiled stressed-out bride who crosses the line and goes totally psycho (This is MY DAY!!!) It's also one of those 'what-would-you-do-if-it-happened-to-you' type movies. If I were one of the guys I would have cleaned up the coke, put away the booze, and called for an ambulance and the police right away- they were all so rich they probably could have found good sleazy lawyers who could have gotten them off with a slap on the wrist at most. I also like the fact that everyone pretty much gets what they deserve by the end of the movie, and it has a nice depressing ending.

Gattaca is a wonderful cerebral piece that asks the question, If a person is created with better genes, would the better genes make a better person? Of course, we know the answer. Nevertheless, in this futuristic world of Gattaca, the genetic make-up of people helps determine the future of their lives. Traits such as obesity and heart disease can be weeded out during an in-vitro birth operation. If you have a baby the old fashion way, you run the risk of creating an in-valid -- someone who has a detrimental genetic make-up.An in-valid named Vincent (Ethan Hawke) does not want to be fettered by his bad genes. He works in a space center as a janitor, but dreams of more. He hires a DNA broker who creates a symbiotic relationship with a DNA donor (Jude Law) who has the perfect genes, but was paralyzed in an accident. Vincent becomes Jerome and is employed by the space center as a programmer. Soon, his excellent work is appreciated and he gets a chance to work on one of Saturn's moons. However, he has to avoid being caught -- women are interested in good genes and sometimes take hair samples to check out those DNA sequences. In addition, a murder has been committed to a director who was opposed to Vincent's mission and Detective Hugo (Alan Arkin) is consistantly checking blood, urine and hair amongst the employees.Vincent also falls in love with Irene (Uma Thurman) who genetic structure is not good enough to get her to work out in space.

I can instantly tell you what scene was occuring by listening to just a couple of seconds of the soundtrack. I've probably seen that movie over 50 times and loved every minute.Which is why I am so disappointed by TPM, which almost seemed like a bad rip-off film created by some third-rate copycat wannabees. They spent $120 million on the special effects, and about twenty bucks on the dialogue, which forced the poor actors and actresses into looking like wooden Al Gore puppets blandly reciting their lines.The characters in TPM lack any of the believability, chemistry, or ensemble acting which made Episode IV so compelling. Who CARES if Anakin Skywalker (who sounds like he's reciting his lines, poor kid) wins the pod race?Who CARES about the people of Naboo? Does anybody really believe that Anakin's mother -- well, is his mother? And the droid army looked like a bunch of storks. Is there a I hate Jar-Jar club? Sign me up.

He gave a delicate performance and made the romantic comedy his best work to date.  You could easily tell growth was occurring, and the film responded by being extremely popular when nothing much was expected from it.  The Waterboy was made during Sandler's Wedding success, thus not able to build on that growth as an actor.  Big Daddy has the ability to see that a less silly Sandler can still achieve serious coin.  While no Truman Show, this new film plays up the emotions with the hope of showing off some dramatic chops that Sandler might possess.  The result is a perpetually funny film that has the brains not to ruin the wacky stuff with superfluous tears. Reuniting with his Happy Gilmore director Dennis Dugan (who has a great cameo as the man who wishes he answered the front door on Halloween), Sandler stars as Sonny Koufax, a slacker who cannot seem to get his act together.  In an attempt to impress his girlfriend (Kristy Swanson), Sonny adopts a child that was mistakenly dropped off at his front door.  The two soon develop a affinity and become a very unique father and son combination. The story is basically an excuse for Sandler and co-screenwriter Tim Herlihy to shower the audience with gags involving typical child-rearing frustrations. Peeing in the bed, disobedience, first day of school, and a very funny bit involving shopping for groceries are all touched on.  Intermixed with the usual oddball humor that I love about Sandler-Herlihy screenplays are nice quiet moments encompassing Sonny's romance with a lawyer played by Joey Lauren Adams.  It is this segment of the movie that Sandler shows off the lovable charm that oozed out of the flawless Wedding Singer. Without Drew Barrymore around, the romantic moments in Big Daddy seems more of a screenplay conceit that a real subplot.  Still, they are funny and touching in a roundabout way. Now I say this with a straight face Sandler has yet to really write and headline a bad film.  Movies like Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison get beat up all the time over their adolescent jokes.  I for one praise the comedian for remaining funny just as the box office stakes are rising.  Big Daddy is packed with grand jokes and a healthy sense of the odd that made the previous pics so endearing.  Writer Herlihy provides the exquisite one-liners and Director Dugan keeps the visual gags fast and proficient. The three are an impregnable team that I hope can continue this run for another film. When it comes to the dramatic moments, Big Daddy doesn't really falter, it just stumbles a bit.  It comes off as a bit fake to see Adam Sandler trying to muster tears over his beloved child.  I don't suggest that Sandler is incapable of dramatic work, but this film forces it a bit.  Standing back and letting the drama lead the way might have been a better option.  There's an audience to please out there, so the baby steps on display here might the right way to do this.  In ten years, when Adam Sandler in 'Macbeth' opens, I'll be first in line, assured that Sandler can be the actor that I suspect he wants to be. Big Daddy shouldn't frustrate anyone looking for big laughs.  This streak that Sandler is on has been marvelous, one film after another just pure fun. As long as he continues to write his own material, as long as the jokes remain ambiguous and risky, I'll go to the ends of the Earth defending him as a true original.

That knowledge ruined much of the plot for me.  All that aside, Angels is a very...interesting film.  We--at least I don't--usually think about the possible presence of angels.  In the film, they're literally everywhere--in the library, in the park, relaxing on top of a highway exit sign.  Nicolas Cage is perfect as Seth, the angel who longs to be human for Meg Ryan's character.  See, angels can't feel anything, so love is a dead end road for them apparently.  That was a peculiar point and seems even stranger the more you think about it. The movie was, really, leading up to the inevitable Big Romance Scene, and I don't think I'm giving much away by telling you one such moment exists. It is a romance, and strives to be as romantic as possible.  In some ways it truly is.  But the kitchen scene in which Maggie discovers Seth is indeed an angel is contrived.  (I cannot conceive of it! is a prime example.) But of course the lovers need a fight scene to increase the tension between them.  But from there it is a slippery slope and we know they'll wind up together.  Perhaps with a little more friction we could have kept guessing.
