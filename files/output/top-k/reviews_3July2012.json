The plot is so simple but so brilliantly presented that it's quite difficult to not be touched by it. In it, the honest farmer Dan Evans (Van Heflin) fearing that he might lose his farm due to the amount of debts decides to take the enormous risk of escorting a dangerous bandit, the charming and manipulating Ben Wade (Glenn Ford, at the top of his game). Evans task is to keep an eye on the bad guy and later take him to the nearest town to catch a train to Yuma that leaves at 310 and from there he'll be judged for his crimes.It's all good but Evans situation isn't so promising. Yes, he'll get paid for the service no one wants and here comes the dangers Wade's partners now led by Charlie Prince (Richard Jaeckal) will try to rescue him. Worst than this is Wade's tactics to convince Dan to let him go, promising to give him a better payment, not to mention Wade's attempts to escape. What's at stake here is the lives of two men with so much to gain and at the same time everything to lose. Tense, thrilling and impeccable from minute one, 310 to Yuma is more than just the western, it's a great character study that reveals important things about people, their character, their force and their persistence in a goal. Breaks the old concept of giving us a scary and ugly villain by trading it for a very likable bad guy that when you look deep into his eyes you can see that all he ever wanted to be is to be someone like Dan, with a wife and kids and good things to look at it instead of just robbing people. He can't have that because he's not the kind of person who settles at anything. When the movie is not on so worried with this aspect there's something exciting waiting for us, just as good as High Noon (quite similar films actually, both involving men dealing with a mortal deadline that can change their lives). The whole sequence at the hotel is amazing, a perfect way to test our heart and nerves. And those effects can be achieved even now, it's that good. And to sustain such remark, I suggest you to watch the remake directed by James Mangold in 2007 with Christian Bale and Russell Crowe in the main roles and compare both versions. While the new movie has nice improvements (such as Dan's teenage son being part of the group that holds Ben; or the presentation of Charlie Prince as a gay character - you only notice that if you get the innuendos), they go for more spectacular sequences and violent scenes than just manipulating us in what can happen. It's a good film as well, works better with a younger audience but it's just in the entertainment level. Delmer Daves film goes deeper! Couldn't finish this without saying that the acting was first rate and one of the many pleasures of seeing this classic, with Heflin giving us courage and fear as being two things of a whole, you never know where does one begin and the other end. And the simplicity he gets in presenting those sensations, marvelous. Ford is the opposite. He's bad, mean yet appealing to make you like him, cheer for him sometimes. The Porutguese title for the movie reflects with accuracy what his character is Gallant and Bloodthirsty. Inside of that facade capable of winning the ladies trust (even Dan's wife) there's a merciless killer that doesn't care to shoot a man of his group if he's on his way of shooting another target.Don't need to say more about it, it's a must-see film, western fans or not. 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"3 July 2012","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" 310 to Yuma shows that sometimes a movie doesn't need much to be a great movie.

Chase of the same name, is a movie intended for all the fans of classic screwball comedies, and gentle, entertaining whimsy, appealing to the viewer's imagination and moving most intimate emotions. It is an amusing comedy with a fantasy twist to it, looking oh-so-magical in the eyes of a regular passerby.Due to its marvelously fresh screenplay the movie flows so gently and freely, rarely changing locations, which makes it actually looks like a stage play performed in the most vivid and subtle manner. The direction by Henry Koster is very imaginative and thorough, and the acting, particularly by James Stewart and Josephine Hull, shows their great engagement in the roles, thus making the picture much more enjoyable. It should be noted that Stewart once said that he considered playing Elwood P. Dowd as one of his most significant achievements. Even though it presents a heartwarming story about a man, who has an imaginary 6-foot three rabbit as a friend (visible only to unique individuals?), the plot deals with some very controversial topics, considering the times, in which it premiered. There are the notions of habitual drinking, Celtic mythology, mental illness, delusions, paranoia, and magic. After a few embarrassments Elwood P Dowd's family tries to put him in a, so-called, loony bin, just to make sure that he wouldn't scare more people with his illusory tales about a big rabbit companion. However, because of a hilarious turn of events, it happens so that his sister Veta is admitted as one of the patients and Elwood goes away. So the hunt begins for a lunatic on the loose. In what turns out to be a ridiculous affair filled with drinking, romance, compassion, and many laughable situations, Elwood is finally faced with a tough decision &#x96; all of his friends, relatives, and doctors urge him to take a serum and let Harvey go. Yet a deeply upset Veta, who starts banging on the examining room door, abruptly stops what was about to come out of this tricky farce.One of the main reasons to see Harvey is the possibility to observe the wonderfully warm and truly sympathetic presentation of characters. James Stewart is irrefutably amazing as a slightly foolish, yet overly sociable and friendly, boozer and rabbit fancier. Josephine Hull gives an unforgettable performance as the loud, hysteric, and always-worried sister, who through her actions and words would probably fit in at the mental hospital. What's more, all of the supporting characters bring much joy to the overall outlook.To make a long story short, if you are a fan of charming and amusing comedies with a twist from the golden era of Hollywood you should definitely watch Harvey, as it is one of the most lighthearted and timeless shows ever.
