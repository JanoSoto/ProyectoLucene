[{"date":"28 January 2006","score":"","review":" Based on Bob Burden's comic books (famous for 'Flaming Carrot') and utilizing the term Mystery Men from the golden age of mysterious costumed heroes, there's nothing very mysterious about this bunch of lower-middle class everymen who feel a need to dress up and play hero. This type of satire on super-heroes is difficult to pull off since most people think any super-hero is a satire anyway. Grown men and women dressed in strange costumes are hard to take seriously, unless you're a pre-teen, usually. This movie uses the overall silly super-hero premise as a springboard and dives headfirst into the utterly odd world of super-heroics, focusing on a group of costumed do-gooders who are blue-collar, low rent - however you want to term them. They have no money for fancy headquarters or super weapons (which most super-heroes in comic books always seem to), and even no super-powers. The Bowler (Garofalo), introduced late, does have a supernatural bowling ball she tosses about, but that's it. When you think about it, this movie presentation of super-heroes actually comes closer to depicting what it would really be like if super-heroes actually existed. I always found the endless supply of funds for HQ and transport in super-hero comics to be really tough to buy into. The satire works, for the most part. The heroes here are pretty inept. They usually start out OK on a mission, such as in the beginning, to the rescue at an old folks home. They have the right attitude and commitment. But we find that this gets them only so far, as even lousy-seeming criminals get the best of them in the end, and the heroes limp back to their homes with cuts and bruises. The core trio are very good Mr. Furious (Stiller), the Shoveler (Macy) and Raja (Azaria) form the epicenter of a great cast. The only real hero seems to be Capt.Amazing (Kinnear), but he's an arrogant opportunist heavy into endorsements. The underdog heroes are placed in the position of rescuing him from the villain (Rush), a Germanic psycho job resembling a combo Lex Luthor\/Joker, but they tend to foul things up, so we know things won't go too well. However, since their hearts are in the right place (unlike Capt.Amazing), they should persevere, with the help of the truly mysterious Sphinx (Studi). It's amusing throughout, with some of the loser-heroes, notably Stiller as Mr.Furious, trapped by in-fighting and loss of confidence. The verbal sparring between Furious and most of the others is worth a chuckle or two, especially when he challenges the sagely advice of the Sphinx. The set design and atmosphere are quite well done, having a vaguely futuristic \/ Gotham City feel to it. This doesn't become an instant classic, probably because of the director's inexperience. He focuses a bit too much on fancy angles & editing, taking away from the whole satirical experience. It could of used some fine-tuning in some sequences and the 3rd act seems sort of by the numbers to get things resolved in a heroic manner. But it's fairly enjoyable, reminding most of us of why we liked to sit down and read those four-color adventures in the first place they were a fun escape from the rigors of conformity.

Even as I sit here for what must be the 206th viewing, I marvel, as acutely as I did in the very first viewing, that this tale has the compelling and overwhelming power to touch aesthetically, viscerally, profoundly and emotionally my sense of pride,injustice, soul. Even if this were not a true story, I would still recommend this movie to everyone with awe and reverence. And even as I watch, there is goose-flesh and damp eyes. As there always is...Based on the letters compiled and only two reference books (including One Gallant Rush by Peter Burchard, which I proudly own), this tells the tale of the heretofore largely unknown 54th Massachusetts Infantry, the first Afro-American regimen in American history during the Civil War. Colonel Robert Gould Shaw was a 26-year old bright eyed Bostonian who was chosen by favor to lead the first colored regimen at the apex of the Civil War. Matthew Broderick portrays Col. Shaw as accurately as possible, bringing the youth and zeal of the real Shaw to grand light. He was truly overwhelmed by the thought of leading the troops, but idealistic and optimistic enough to give it everything he had and to make his family and title proud. Broderick never loses sight of the simple fact that Shaw was humble and grateful for every advancement he was given. Although in reality the 54th was compiled of mostly free black men from upper New England, Denzel Washington is cast as the runaway slave Trip who brings his grudges and injustices to the troop. He portrays a slave who is on a personal mission to hurt those who have hurt him (if you know about the history of slavery, one can hardly blame him), but in the process hurts himself all the more until by rote he learns to channel his hate into determination, and by his actions is humiliated and beaten down to the point that he can only rise up like a griffin and prove that he is as much a soldier as the rest of them. The 'whipping scene' in which you see him go through that exact process, every emotion known to a man culminating in a quiver of the cheek, a single tear escaping, and eyes that shred, plea, hate, mourn, haunt. That Denzel could convey that with a role that could have easily been a stereotype deserves more praise that I can type. Morgan Freeman is a man of quiet yet profound dignity that carries him in every role he plays, and this time as Rawlins is no exception. He is a victim of prejudice, but still carries his own as a man. He is there for his men as a leader even before being officially decorated, but he is not above reaching out to Shaw to help his men simply because Shaw is yet another white authority--he helps the cause, no matter the colors. And that cause is so much more than the War, which I will explain further below...The score by the wunderkind James Horner is Majesty in every literary definition of the word. I know that if I'm ever stressed and need a release, all I have to do is pop in a CD of this score, listen for only a few minutes, and I will be sobbing. In my humble opinion he has yet to top himself with his work in this picture. From the subtle ache of a single horn to the swelling of the Harlem Boys' Choir and their keening voices that beg us to remember forever.I won't break down the actors, directing or anything individually any more than I have because that's not the intention of this film. It's not a star vehicle, but rather hundreds of people coming together to tell a story they believe in. And as such, deserve to be praised as a whole, which only proves how well they've done their work. But some scenes cannot escape the psyche...The morning after they've been read a proclamation stating that they will be put to death, black and white, if caught bearing Union arms, and there they stand as a unit for roll call, not one man deserting, at attention for duty, prouder and taller than ever...The aforementioned Corporal Punishment scene (which, by the way, was the same punishment white officers would suffer if they deserted as well)...The charge on Fort Wagner--Shaw finally returning to the seashore he so loved all his life for what he knows in his heart is the last time, feeling home again and yet feeling already a walking spectre--Rawlins with a divine inner pride in his eyes marching toward the fort as Thomas looks to the others and Trip with no longer the mad lashing-out force to kill but the aggravated determination to win--the company as a whole marching into Fate with a gallant unified step...The true meaning of hero is in the heart of a man who faces even death if it will prove himself a man, not only to others but to himself. This lies true for every person in that brave pioneering regimen, black and white. They didn't just die for their country or their rights, but for their own personal honors and faiths as human beings who are deserved of dignity. The likes of which this country will never see again, but must not fall into obscurity. At the heart, and in my heart, this is not a story of men, but what it means to be a man. And the sacrifice it sometimes takes to become one and prove yourself one. We as a Nation, as Earth, should thank the 54th for that beautiful lesson. This pristine film will guarantee it so.

Romance, for Hawthorne, occurs in shadows, so we cannot quite know what is real and what we imagine. Is Dimmesdale's scarlet letter real or psychological? In the film it is very real, carved into his chest, and the quick juxtaposition of his letter with Hester's is powerful, as, at last, they stand on the scaffold together. Great scenes include the one that culminates in Pearl's baptism, beautifully developed and based on the love of Hester and Dimmesdale and on the witnesses' belief that Dimmesdale acts out of piety, as opposed to some mingling of love and guilt. And the cross-cutting between Hester on the scaffold and an agonized Dimmesdale on the platform of judgment is superb. Gish conveys powerful emotions with subtle shifts in her expression, and Dimmesdale's pain is magnified by its being understood in one way by Hester and in quite another by the censorious crowd. A comic and non-Hawthornian subplot involves the revenge wrought by Giles against the gossip who has caused much of the trouble. She is dunked in the village's water supply. The film moves, as does the novel, with a deterministic inevitability. Gish's vulnerable Hester is at the heart of the story.

Romance, for Hawthorne, occurs in shadows, so we cannot quite know what is real and what we imagine. Is Dimmesdale's scarlet letter real or psychological?

Great scenes include the one that culminates in Pearl's baptism, beautifully developed and based on the love of Hester and Dimmesdale and on the witnesses' belief that Dimmesdale acts out of piety, as opposed to some mingling of love and guilt. And the cross-cutting between Hester on the scaffold and an agonized Dimmesdale on the platform of judgment is superb. Gish conveys powerful emotions with subtle shifts in her expression, and Dimmesdale's pain is magnified by its being understood in one way by Hester and in quite another by the censorious crowd. A comic and non-Hawthornian subplot involves the revenge wrought by Giles against the gossip who has caused much of the trouble. She is dunked in the village's water supply.

After the Nazis have invaded and conquered the country, a brave resistance fighter assassinates the brutal leader of the German occupation forces, SS leader Reinhard Heydrich, who, like Klaus Barbie, was a ruthless butcher of the innocent. Heydrich subjugated the Czech people by murdering, torturing and enslaving hordes of non-combatant civilians. Just before the Nazi tyrant is shot, he threatens to end a factory slowdown by the murder of hundreds of Czech workers. It is this threat that precipitates the assassination. The desperate killer of Heydrich, member of an underground Czech resistance group, narrowly escapes capture with the assistance of civilians who suffer the consequences immediately afterwards when many are taken hostage by the Nazis, with the threat of imminent death hanging over their heads if the assassin is not turned over to the Gestapo.At the center of the tense drama is Nasha Novotny, flawlessly played by Anna Lee, as the daughter of a distinguished university professor and patriot, portrayed by character actor Walter Brennan. Nasha is instrumental in aiding Brian Donlevy (as Dr. Svoboda, the assassin with ice water in his veins) to escape his bloodthirsty Gestapo pursuers. But when Nasha's own father is picked up by the Gestapo, she is forced to question her loyalty to the resistance, begins to regard the man she has saved as a deadly threat to her family and nearly turns traitor to save her father's life. Expatriate German director Fritz Lang and his scenarists show great sympathy in portraying this all too human failing. In a few simple touches they go far beyond stereotype in showing how the recalcitrant patriot overcomes her strong personal misgivings to rejoin the heroic struggle against the Nazis.Hangmen is not a movie for the mechanically minded. Its craft is the art of understatement. Many of the events dramatically most important to the story -- such as the assassination -- are not depicted or happen off-screen. Whole sections of the plot line are there only by inference. This is particularly true at the end of the film, when the entire conspiracy to frame up an enemy collaborator is only hinted at before it is sprung as a surprise upon the audience, as on the unwitting villain. How did the underground resistance fighters arrange to fabricate so deadly a case against a traitor? We can only guess, but may hardly object to the ironic way in which the informant meets his end.Fritz Lang has a well known reputation as a leader of the noir school of film maker. Yet, in spite of its horrifying premise, the movie is neither bleak nor pessimistic but a straightforward affirmation of the struggle against tyranny. Unlike many of his less gifted followers, Lang is no mere stylist but is just as much concerned with the historic and moral significance of his story as the artful way in which he presents it. To those who might object that the Nazis are portrayed as stereotyped bad men, the answer is that the Nazis were precisely what the film shows them to be ugly brutish travesties of human beings. And who would know that better than Fritz Lang and his excellent scenarist Bertolt Brecht? Both of them had lived in Germany under the Nazis and escaped to the United States to strike a devastating propaganda blow against the enemy.

Quantrill like most of the bushwhackers (irregular southern sympathizers) and jay hawkers (irregular northern sympathizers)was simply out for personal gain. He didn't give a damn which side won the war. That most of his band of outlaws supported the South, including Cole Younger and Jesse James, mattered little to him as long as they kept their commander's coffers full of gold and the spoils of looting and robbing.Though the grand finale of the burning of Lawrence, Kansas, is not as spectacular as the burning of Atlanta in Gone With the Wind, in many ways Dark Command is a more realistic, less romanticized, account of the Civil War period. It is certainly less racist than Gone With the Wind. Much of this is owed to the script based on a novel by the usually gangster oriented writer W.R. Burnett (Little Caesar, The Asphalt Jungle)and to the direction of Raoul Walsh.Making all this gel is an exceptional cast handpicked by Walsh and Republic. Heading the roster is John Wayne who had recently gained acceptance from the Hollywood moguls as a result of his standout performance in Stagecoach. Republic threw in their cowboy star Roy Rogers and his sidekick Gabby Hayes. Roy, though somewhat miscast, does a creditable job showing a wide range of emotions and gives life to his role of kid brother who wants to be a contender. When Roy and Dale had a show on the Nashville Network in the 1980's, they invited viewers to send in questions they would answer on the air, sending the writer an autographed picture in return. I asked Roy about his being teamed with John Wayne in Dark Command. In answering the question on the air, it was obvious that he was not pleased with his appearance along side the Duke. Perhaps Republic had pushed Roy into the part holding him to his contract. Whatever the reason, Roy had no need to be ashamed. His performance indicates that he could have succeeded in A movies had that been his desire. Gabby Hayes is in top form and his role not only adds much needed humor to this rather dark film but serves also as a father figure and guiding hand to the man from Texas played by Wayne. Walter Pigeon adds a degree of dignity to his role portraying Quantrill (Cantrell in the film) as a three dimensional character with both good and bad in his nature. Upstaging them all is the divine Claire Trevor who walks away with the show. This is a Republic picture so naturally the action and stunts are going to be first rate, especially with the likes of Yakima Canutt on the payroll. There is also the gallery of bad guys under contract to Republic who were some of the most despicable heavies in film history. Adding to the authenticity of the movie is music from the period, including two Stephen Foster songs.
