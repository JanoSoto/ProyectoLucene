It is a uniquely artistic and well made horror film that presents the viewer with some of the most graphic, yet visually stunning and artistic scenes imaginable. The film concerns a young man named Fenix (played as a child by the director's young son then as an adult by his older son) who was born the son of a religiously obsessed woman who is part of a strange cult that worships a woman who was murdered and had both arms removed. This woman soon meets up with a circus owner who takes her and her son in but then begins an elicit affair with a woman who works for the circus who is covered from head to toe with tattoos! When Fenix's mother walks in on the two of them doing the deed, she douses her philandering husband's private parts with acid and he retaliates by cutting both her arms off before slicing his own throat! A few years later, Fenix (who witnessed this entire spectacle) is now in a mental institution and there is an unusual scene involving his leaving the institution for a night and roaming the streets with several mentally deficient patients while high on cocaine! Fenix is eventually freed from the institution by his mother, who miraculously survived the previous attack but is now without her arms. She takes her son under her wing and the two create a strange illusion type stage show involving Fenix standing behind his mother during the performance using his own arms to simulate her missing arms! He becomes his mother's arms during their everyday life as well in some intricately thought out scenes involving the two of them playing the piano and performing other daily tasks! Anytime Fenix becomes to closely attached to any female his mother compels him to kill her using her body and his arms until eventually Fenix can take no more leading to the film's unusual and unpredictable ending. This film is an absolute assault on your senses and even though it is graphic it must be seen to be fully appreciated!

The first lot of films is packed with unfunny, forced jokes while the other lot is filled with shouting, drugs, temper tantrums, mental breakdowns, sex, and moping. TV dishes this too. Ghost World's different; it's proof characters can be interesting without having problems, that movies can be smart without people going ape, and it shows movies can be funny without lame, sexist jokes and unlikeable characters. It also shows that there are people besides the attractive and popular, and the depressed and the junkies. This is my equal favourite movie with The Craft and Sucker Punch, for a few reasons; its characters, story, it relatability, and timelessness.Enid's an awesome character, arty, cynical, intelligent, talented, honest, mostly knows what she wants, stands firm for what she believes, is an individual, and won't compromise or sell out. At the same time, she's cruel (kinda sociopathic), a bit lazy, a bit dishonest, and even a user. However these flaws don't really bother me. She's not the kind of person who expects to be liked despite their faults (aka Brian from Family Guy), and she's under no illusions about who she is. Her death stares are something I wish I could do.Rebecca, despite the fact she fades from view, isn't so bad. She reaches the point where she thinks a fold out ironing board is cool, adores plastic cups, and disses her former people(forgetting where she came from). At the same time, I reckon her wish to be normal was a cop out. However she's not under any illusions about what she's doing and she sticks by Enid for most of the flick despite their drift apart. Seymour's cool. He's happy to stand out from the pack, and isn't asking for much. But he's too self-loathing, and he sells out for a time when he dates Dana, who isn't the one for him, and forgets Enid who genuinely wanted to help him.The story is great. It's set at a time that doesn't get a lot of attention in movies. Just after high school, but not yet at uni or the workforce. Most movies about young people are in high school or uni. It's setting is great, it could be just about anywhere; large town, city suburb, poor, middle class, but the focus is the characters and plot. It's easy to follow and all parts fit together. I'm never thinking hey wait a minute, what about what happened...?. It doesn't take the viewers for morons; the characters're smart, they're not begging for sympathy, they know what's happening, they aren't cold hearted fish, they're not MENSA applicants and they're not nunces like the ones in Project X. They're individuals, doing the things they like.I can really relate to Enid. I love art, i'm cynical, honest to a fault, sarcastic. I love having digs at lots of people too; one of my work places is in Hornsby and it's filled with over eaters, drop kicks, teen smokers, druggies, obnoxious parents, westies and so on. I'm also mercenary to a point, and can look and act cold. I also tried to stay out of the work force, even though I needed work. At the moment I can relate to her loneliness. I barely see my friends; one now has a girlfriend, one is busy, and another and I are taking time out. Others have just drifted away.It's a timeless film. I'm able to relate to it no matter what stage I'm at; post high school, early uni, even now when I'm in the work force. Now when I'm in my lonely phase and feeling left out. I see a lot of myself in Enid, and I want to be like her; her death stares, bluntness, confidence and wit.The other triumph is the ending. It's cool. A lot of movies and TV shows end on a sugary, walk into the sunset, happily ever after note. People become attractive, get a job, get the job they want, get laid, get a date, wear a suit, get married, keep their house, realise the benefits of normal. Dexter series 3 descended into schmuck, Six Feet Under gave most characters a peaceful, healthy, happy, fulfilled future life, Blue Heelers ended with everybody moving on, and even Daria ended this way with everybody getting their wishes. Others end with death, defeat, and tears. Dexter series 4 ended in overkill.The ending is here Ghost World's ending is brilliant. Enid makes the decision not to sell out, do things her way, and be as different from the beginning, but it costs her; she loses her friends, her scholarship,and is deserted. She and Becky part on good terms, but their friendship is not what it used to be, if it exists at all. Becky seems happy with a job, flat, guys, normal hair and clothes, but she's upset to leave Enid. Seymour returns to his old life but must deal with his mother who he can't stand. The ending is up to the viewer. Enid's bus ride out of town gives her the freedom she wanted. What happens afterwards? New town? New friend? Suicide? Love? Art colony? It's a good ending. It's got the same feel as the songs Survival by America and Wonderful Life by Black.Some people have compared this to Daria. But it's different. Daria ended with friendships restored, everyone getting what they wanted, everyone happy, and Daria left the days of Highland behind her.

Becky seems happy with a job, flat, guys, normal hair and clothes, but she's upset to leave Enid. Seymour returns to his old life but must deal with his mother who he can't stand. The ending is up to the viewer. Enid's bus ride out of town gives her the freedom she wanted. What happens afterwards? New town? New friend? Suicide? Love? Art colony? It's a good ending. It's got the same feel as the songs Survival by America and Wonderful Life by Black.Some people have compared this to Daria. But it's different. Daria ended with friendships restored, everyone getting what they wanted, everyone happy, and Daria left the days of Highland behind her. Enid is self confident, Daria was self doubting, Enid took pride in herself, Daria hated the title brain (I'd have loved it), Enid is ready to face the world, Daria was withdrawn, Enid was liberated, but Daria took the moral high ground too many times. Daria was an awesome show, but I prefer Ghost World.

After all, when I see many historical films, I see the errors in the script--where the writers take HUGE liberties with facts. As a result, you would NOT want to go to certain movies (such as Pocahontas) with me, as I invariably complain about the crappy writing and lack of historical accuracy. While Amadeus is a gorgeous film to watch, it is also a film you would probably not want to watch with me! While vaguely following the events of the adult Mozart's life, so much of the film is wrong--terribly, terribly wrong. And, in the process, the film does a terrible disservice to the memories of the folks portrayed in the film. To me, history is like a holy book--you don't just change it to meet your needs--but here in Amadeus, facts just aren't particularly important. In the film, Antonio Salieri is a bitter, nasty no-talent. It's easy to urinate on his memory today--it's not like he has family members who will defend him after 200 years! And even worse is the portrayal of Mozart who is shown to be a two-dimensional man. On one hand, he's a musical genius. On the other, he's a blithering idiot whose laugh makes your skin crawl--and there's absolutely no evidence that this aspect of the character is the least bit like the real Mozart.Now if you completely ignore history, the film is good---very good. The sets and costumes are lovely and it looks as if you have been transformed back to the 18th century. It certainly deserved Oscars for Art Direction, Costume Design, Makeup, Direction, Sound and other technical categories. F.

Tom Hulce, on the other hand, is so annoying at times with his horrid and piercing laugh that I could see why this film didn't result in him being catapulted into stardom.

It tells the story about an unemployed recovering alcoholic named Joe Kavanagh who lives in an apartment in Glasgow. Joe spends most of his time with his friends from the soccer team he coaches, his friend named Shanks and is a regular attendant at anonymous alcoholics meetings. His recovering process is going well and one day when he is visiting his cousin named Liam and his pregnant girlfriend named Sabine, he encounters a woman named Sarah who works as a social visitor. Joe meets Sarah again and a connection emerges, but then Joe learns that Liam has gotten himself involved with a local criminal.Distinctly and engagingly directed by English filmmaker Ken Loach, this finely paced fictional tale which is narrated from multiple viewpoints though mostly from the main character's point of view, draws a humane, heartrending and gripping portrayal of a man who finds himself caught in a moral conflict whilst trying to come to terms with a past of violence and decay which has marred his character. While notable for it's naturalistic milieu depictions, fine cinematography by English cinematographer Barry Ackroyd, production design by English production designer and art director Martin Johnson (1939-2003), authentic dialog and characteristic realism, this character-driven story from the late 1990s which is one of Ken Loach's most successful films and where a man is making an effort to maintain his first serious relationship with a woman whom is willing to look past the person he once was and accept him for the man he is becoming, depicts an in-depth and compassionate study of character and contains a timely score by English composer George Fenton.This at times very humorous and charming drama which is set in Scotland and where the protagonist considers it as his obligation to make a choice that could jeopardize both his ongoing recovery and his evolving and loving relationship, is impelled and reinforced by it's efficient narrative structure, substantial character development, the exceptionally moving and heartfelt acting performance by Scottish actor and director Peter Mullan and the fine supporting acting performances by Scottish actress Louise Goodall and Scottish actor David Hayman. An unsentimental, romantic and afflicting love-story which gained, among other awards, the award for Best Actor Peter Mullan at the 51th Cannes Film Festival in 1998, the Audience Award at the Valladolid International Film Festival in 1998, the British Independent Film Award for Best British Director of an Independent Film Ken Loach, Best Original Screenplay by a British Writer of a Produced Independent Film Paul Laverty and Best British Independent Film at the 1st British Independent Film Awards in 1998.

The script from George Axelrod, working off the novel by Richard Condon, is a labyrinth of conspiracy and intrigue, making the motivations of each character unclear and putting the truth of every moment constantly in question. You can never be sure if what you are watching is a fact or a deception, thoroughly absorbing you into a dizzied state. Frankenheimer has created a rare film that is able to keep it's atmosphere going through every scene. From the first deeply unsettling dream\/memory that we experience, everything becomes immersed in this eerie tone, that haunting world somewhere between fantasy and reality.Condon's characters come alive on the screen, as portrayed by an ensemble of compelling actors at the top of their game. Raymond Shaw is one of the most tragic characters ever put to film, and Laurence Harvey's portrayal of him is an all-time favorite. Harvey creates a deeply sympathetic figure out of a spoiled boy, torn by his desires and his duties, torn apart on all sides by people who want to use him for their own gain. Every moment with him is a rich character study, as Harvey portrays the deep anguish and unrequited desires of this broken man. The Oedipal subtext between him and one of the most terrifying screen mother's, played with sinister skill by Angela Lansbury, adds yet another layer to this remarkably realized performance.The story is rich with political commentary on McCarthyism, but it's social relevance still manages to resonate today. Frankenheimer's direction is some of the best ever put on screen, fully in control of his entire picture, staging everything exactly how it needs to be. Scenes that appear insignificant early on are given great importance, there isn't a moment that is wasted whether we are building characters or setting the stage for the ultimate showdown. Using innovative angles and shooting techniques, Frankenheimer heightens the tension beyond what was already on the page, creating a thriller that makes it's audience think while also keeping them on the edge of their seat.

Namely, the screenplay itself remains unconvincing to the end. It was like the script was written in two days with haste, and then delivered to the studio, and without any rewrites to try to tie up any loose ends that the film might have, they just went on ahead and made the film anyway. I feel like Jeb Stuart was in love with his idea from the start, and didn't care about how little sense it made at the time, he just acted like he was Kerouac pounding on his typewriter in the midst of writing On The Road, and published the story intact with errors and inconsistencies abound.The story itself has a nice feel to it, our characters are mostly pretty likable people, and the locale of the story is probably the best thing about it. It makes you feel for the traveling soul, puts you in their disposition, and makes you feel right at home. The snowy mountains sure do look nice on camera, but this doesn't save the movie from being completely just LACKING in the story department. The tone of the film is good, but the pacing is just all wrong. It feels entirely too rushed, and maybe if Jeb Stuart had just sat on this idea just a little bit longer, and maybe rewritten the screenplay a few times, he could have had something really spectacular on his hands.Dennis Quaid is a good actor, in my opinion. I know he is really just an A-list actor with a B-movie star personality, but I generally enjoy his characters, because he never gets too carried away with it. Danny Glover and Jared Leto are the real centerpieces of the action here, and they play off of one another nicely, and I would say it is them with a little help from R. Lee Ermey that save this movie from being a complete waste of time. Ted Levine and William Fichtner are basically just wasted talent here.

And it is easy, since Draven is already dead and can't be hurt. He is indestructible and invincible. Until Top Dollar figures out that it is the raven that gives Draven his superhuman powers.Not a very entertaining story, since it doesn't get any suspense until the final ten minutes, and barely then either. Draven, with his powers, is simply to powerful. There is no threat to him. What it is is an action packed dark story. The scenery is very dark, it is always raining and the Gothic influence is heavy. Visually it is interesting, but not very good either.Had Draven been vulnerable somehow, this could have been really good. Now, ironically, it is mostly known and interesting since lead actor Brandon Lee died in an accident while filming it. Had the accident never occurred, I believe this movie would have been forgotten long ago.I feel that it is a movie one should have seen. But it wasn't very memorable, unfortunately.4\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"11 March 2012","score":"7 out of 13 people found the following review useful","review":" The Crow is an action and revenge movie.
