I doubt that the events in the movie are historically 100% accurate but I liked how Doug Wright subdued a quite few facts about de Sade and the era in order create a provoking drama about the power of the word. The movie examines some long accepted paradigms, gets deep into them and turns their components upside down. Religion is no longer the epitome of virtue and innocence and uncensored creativity is not necessarily mischievous. Good and evil, virtue and vice are not easily defined or distinguished; they interplay and exchange places all the time, and to understand one, we must understand the other.This switching of rules and blurring of boundaries will leave you with some serious questions about the nature of art and its effect on the human mind; is it liberating or sin-provoking? Does it build identities or corrupt souls? Should it be censored or not? And, in the first place, what exactly should be called 'art'? Whatever side you're on, the movie will upset your former convictions and stir countless questions in your head.The story is beautifully and grippingly developed. However, the exquisite performance of Rush, Winslet, Caine and Phoenix is what gave shape and soul to the film. Geofrrey Rush's depiction of the Marquis de Sade is hauntingly unforgettable. Kate Winslet dealt with her role as the innocent, yet playful, chambermaid Madeline with professional ease and confidence. The whole cast seemed to be in great harmony actually.The movie is not about obscene and erotic literature per se.

My vision is blurred, but there is nothing to see. The streets are virtually empty, and my friends and family are lifeless; sitting, standing or even walking, but with nothing to do or say, and nowhere to go. No questions are asked because there is nothing to learn, nothing is discussed because nothing is interesting. And it is this dismal reality I am faced with, only partially aware that there is anything better.The existence I dream of is somewhat reminiscent of the world of Jeremy Theobald, the main character in Following, who becomes father to a hideously deformed baby. That's what the film is about at face value, but the very style in which it is portrayed is the real beauty of it. The setting and scenery makes the film one of the most desperately depressing I have ever seen. And although Jeremy seems to be devoid of any spark of personality, we can't help but sympathise with him throughout the film.Similar to my dream, the only form of light is artificial, the streets are virtually empty, and the only person in the entire film who has any personality is the father-in-law, and the only thing he has to talk about is his poor health. He also seems to be the only one with any link to better times. (I've watched this city turn from pastures to the hell-hole it is now.) The city they live in is completely industrialized, and the only plant life seen is dead, and in a pile of soil on Jeremy's bedside table.Some have suggested it is based after a nuclear holocaust, but nothing is explained to any conclusion. One of the beauties of this film is that it practically begs the viewer to decide for themselves what any of it means, and there are many theories. I warn you not to read the message board of Following before you see the film, as it is so much more powerful and chilling to experience it first-hand.The first time I saw Following, I was completely confused. It is possible that Christopher Nolan just put a load of random imagery together and called it a film. Maybe he wanted the viewers to put it all together and make their own sense of it (or not). On the other hand, there might actually be a set formula behind it and only the very open-minded and discerning audience can properly decipher it.One viewing of Following is enough to raise about a dozen questions, and to leave you gasping for answers. Two viewings are probably enough to give you theories about some of the cryptic depictions hauntingly portrayed. Three viewings might be enough to give you a completely different set of theories, battling persistently against your previous conceptions, but still leaving just a few details that don't quite seem to fit in. The truth is that there may be parts that don't make sense in one interpretation, but fit in perfectly to another. You could probably watch Following several times, and each time see a slightly different story. Or if you were to ask six different people exactly what Following is about, you would get six different answers, each equally correct in their own right, and each equally confused.That being said, this definitely isn't a film for everyone. This is the first Christopher Nolan film I have seen, and it certainly won't be the last. But there will no doubt be many who see this purely as a lot of clever mind tricks and special effects (for its time, anyway.) There will be those who don't like much to think about, and want it all explained bit by bit in perfect detail. Well, Following is an epitome of everything such moviegoers will hate. I will say this for certain If your favourite films are 'Love Actually' or 'Dude, Where's My Car?', you probably won't get much out of Following. But for those who like their concepts challenged once in a while, this film will probably be one to watch again and again until you understand. This is also not a film to be forgotten easily.

I can't stand films that rely on shock value, and the genuine misogyny shown here made me want to puke. I understand it's supposed to be satire.

It takes a bit of courage to watch this movie, but it also has its monumental reward, if you can see it through. As an avid moviegoer, I must confess that human tragedy in movies rarely moves me, and that is perhaps a strange fault of mine. Typically, human setbacks do not reach my emotions for whatever odd reason. But if being human means anything to you, anything at all, then you must have the courage to watch this movie. Quite simply, it could be the best movie ever made. It will make you sad and angry, perhaps both at the same time. I was drawn into the plight of John Merick, who was , to me, one of the most inspiring individuals that has ever graced a character in any movie. Inspiring I say because of his courage and his will and his faith. This is where it meant the most, his determined faith, in the face of adversity. For example, when the doctor brought the lady to see him, John Merrick was such a gentleman to them. He offered them tea, he tried to make them feel at home, and he offered to read them the poetry of the psalms from the bible. NOW THAT truly touched me, for I thought to myself, here is a man who has literally been cast aside by God himself, a man whom God wanted nothing to do with, and yet, HE STILL HAD FAITH. HE STILL BELIEVED. I am not a God fearing man, but this meant something to me. It touched the very core of my heart. HE STILL BELIEVED, after being completely screwed by God. It was a lesson to be learned, an important one. I realized, that deep down in my own self, that if I knew this man, I would have been his best friend. There are many scenes in this movie that will test your human spirit. There are many scenes that quite frankly will be hard to get through. The depiction of mans cruelty to his fellow man is almost overpowering. But always I was drawn to his spirit, his trial to go on, his struggle to accept himself and the world he came into. Anthony Hopkins is the greatest actor of our time, who plays the doctor who befriends Merrick. The scene where he cried a single teardrop that rolled down his face is perhaps the most moving scene I have ever watched. There are many fine moments, such as the scene where the crowd follows Merrick and corners him in the bathroom, where he finallly turns to them stands up for himself as he declares to them that he is a human being. Simply put, this movie is the finest piece of craftsmanship ever made. There will be movies that will be as good, but this movie can never be surpassed. It is just my opinion, but if you have no courage inside of you whatsoever, then you are the one to be pitied, for John Merrick represents the humanity inside of us all. This movie must be seen before you die. David Lynch, (whom I cant stand) has completely changed my perception of movies, and I truly believe that to make this movie, let alone watch it is one of the most necessary human experiences. This movie should be shown to every kid in every school in every city of the world. It will most likely be a film you can only watch once, but have the courage, and the dignity to see past the sadness into a man with a true heart. If you have ever complained about your life, shame on you, see this movie.

It takes a bit of courage to watch this movie, but it also has its monumental reward, if you can see it through. As an avid moviegoer, I must confess that human tragedy in movies rarely moves me, and that is perhaps a strange fault of mine. Typically, human setbacks do not reach my emotions for whatever odd reason. But if being human means anything to you, anything at all, then you must have the courage to watch this movie. Quite simply, it could be the best movie ever made. It will make you sad and angry, perhaps both at the same time. I was drawn into the plight of John Merick, who was , to me, one of the most inspiring individuals that has ever graced a character in any movie. Inspiring I say because of his courage and his will and his faith. This is where it meant the most, his determined faith, in the face of adversity. For example, when the doctor brought the lady to see him, John Merrick was such a gentleman to them. He offered them tea, he tried to make them feel at home, and he offered to read them the poetry of the psalms from the bible. NOW THAT truly touched me, for I thought to myself, here is a man who has literally been cast aside by God himself, a man whom God wanted nothing to do with, and yet, HE STILL HAD FAITH. HE STILL BELIEVED. I am not a God fearing man, but this meant something to me. It touched the very core of my heart. HE STILL BELIEVED, after being completely screwed by God. It was a lesson to be learned, an important one. I realized, that deep down in my own self, that if I knew this man, I would have been his best friend.

A Lesson in Love was mediocre at best, Persona (2003) was pretentious, and The Naked Night was dreadfully boring. The first time I sat down and watched Wild Strawberries I had written it off as another Bergman dud, but a future rewatch proved that it's likely his third best film &#x96; behind Autumn Sonata and From the Life of the Marionettes.The key to enjoying this film is to recognize its two primary themes individualism and false dichotomies. The value of the individual is contrasted with the needs of society as a whole, and the false dichotomy is the illusion that one must choose between one or the other. Bergman communicates these ideas through symbolism. The tree named Otto represents the individual human being, while the surrounding ecosystem represents society as a whole. The false dichotomy presents itself when each character is forced to choose between protecting Otto or the surrounding ecosystem. Without recognizing these symbols, it is impossible for the viewer to appreciate the entertaining content of this film.One of the more interesting characters is the lady botanist. She previously studied individual plants, but claims that she learned nothing from them. She believes that most people are led astray when they look at the individual plants without observing the forest as a whole. This panoramic outlook is fueled when the ecosystem suffers a gradual decline. The botanist claims that the Otto tree is poisoning the ecosystem and must be destroyed to preserve the surrounding environment. The cop asks her if there's a way for both to survive, but she says that it is impossible. However, it is divulged later on that the botanist herself is accelerating the destruction of the environment by dumping large quantities of poison into a nearby well. Her logic is that a quick death and restoration is a better option than the slow, gradual decline that Otto is currently inflicting. This must be a very painful decision coming from a character that values the needs of the many over the needs of the few.Dr. Isak Borg takes more of a natural selection angle, that the dominant individual should rightly survive irregardless of the consequences. He needs force to protect the Otto tree, which is why he wants to persuade the cop to join his side. When the guardian makes reference to the rules of the forest, the viewer will correctly remember that the kidnapper in the opening scene made reference to the rules of the world, and since this movie uses the forest as a symbol for the human world, we now understand that both characters share the same essential outlook. You see, the rules of the world represent the false dichotomy of choosing between the individual and society. The world maintains order by forcing people to make this decision and blinding them from recognizing that a third option does indeed exist. The guardian seems to subconsciously recognize this third option, but his obsession with Otto (aka the individual) prevents him from realizing it.This is where Dr. Isak Borg's character comes into play. He is the swing vote of sorts because his status as a doctor gives him the power of authority. However, he seemingly plays both sides, first opting to protect the first Otto tree and then opting to destroy the second Otto tree. To confuse matters he also destroys the botanist's poison well. Why does he act so erratically? Because he believes that both Otto (aka the individual) and the forest (aka society) need to survive. For him the problem is the way the question is posed. Rules and force attempt to establish a false dichotomy that allows for only two wrong choices instead of the correct third option. Therefore, he chooses to help one Otto and kill another, switching sides to keep the balance between the two forces. This film comes full circle on this theme near the end. The cop redeems his earlier mistake at the beginning of the film (getting both the kidnapper and hostage killed) by saving the botanist near the end without killing the kidnapper, another symbolic representation of avoiding a false dichotomy (of choosing one or another) by saving both.The policeman's refusal to play by the rules of the forest causes chaos on a local level, which is first depicted by the sledgehammer killings in the small town and then by the tree guardian's murder of the botanist's assistant. In addition, the men in black (initially hired to retrieve the first Otto for its apparent monetary value) turn on the local environmentalists and kill them. Even more striking is that these men in black turn down a briefcase full of money and refuse to give the tree guardian a ride (a complete deconstruction of their previous personas that valued money above all else). And since the events within the forest act as a microcosm of the whole world, this local chaos manifests into a worldwide pandemonium. The policeman walks out of the forest to witness the nearby city in flames. His decision to rebel against the rules of the forest has now resulted in the deconstruction of the rules of the world.This is a very well-written movie that is consistent and efficient in its structure. Viewers with an attraction to odd, quirky, deliberately paced art-house films should love this. The environments are also beautiful and moody, and the chilly weather makes this film essential viewing during the late autumn months. A truly great film with more creativity and imagination than a dozen others combined.

I watched it several times and every time I found another moment or scene that made me fall in love once more. That is why I wasn't really able to find any flaws in American Psycho, the gripping tale of a Wall Street yuppie, who turns into a ruthless murderer at night. But that you probably already know. What you may not know is that the amount of blood and gore is on a totally different level that in the book. So if you think that this movie is controversial I advise you to read Bret Easton Ellis' masterpiece. Believe me, you won't regret it. The deep insight into the character's mind and much more brutal descriptions of all sorts of tortures make the movie only a enjoyable complement.This is really the best delusional satire on the Wall Street boom of the 1980's and the presence of a distinct yuppie culture. Every one of the high-positioned businessmen cares only about his looks, bank account and the most expensive food and clothes. Oh, and definitely has no soul whatsoever. No emotional needs. Just look at Bateman. He kills innocent people in order to satisfy his strangest desires and achieve fulfillment. Yet with every killing his cravings become stronger and stronger. He is detached from this world, a true sociopath. But how many of you didn't even once think about killing someone, simply because he did something frustrating? Maybe Patrick is the only one, who is able to present (in a most radical way) his dissatisfaction with humanity and our horrible world. On a totally unrelated topic - how awesome is Christian Bale's as Patrick Bateman? He fits perfectly, with his handsome face, elegance, style, manner of speaking. It's like he was born for that role (and probably for one more - Bat(e)man - notice that this isn't a coincidence). I would also like to mention that the fact that glitz and glamor of Oscar-related greatness passed by American Psycho is a good thing. The movie went on to become one of the most thrilling indie horrors of all time and Bale, being an icon to many, was able to go on working on other great projects without the omnipresent burden of awards.Finally, I would strongly recommend that you watch American Psycho only after reading the book. Then you will be able to appreciate the pure genius of the movie's atmosphere and Bale's acting. It will put a new perspective on your perception of his character. Because, after all, American Psycho is a deeply psychological tale that will keep you focused until the very last minute.

It is extremely violent and just plain creepy! The scene where the dog is hanging from a chain and drowning in water was so WRONG. I wish I could put 0 stars for this one. Do not waste your money on this one. This is quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. My husband and I (who are a young married couple with NO kids) bought it as a set with the original Babe movie. The original Babe is an absolute favorite of ours. We were both looking forward to watching this movie. He was practically jumping up and down in anticipation when we put it on. What a disappointment!!! In the first scene, Hoggit has an extremely violent accident in his well and his legs are removed at knees. The Mrs. travels to a seemingly post-apocalyptic city (which is a mix of every major city in the world) in order to make money to save the farm. This city is void of any halfway-decent moral life form. Everyone she encounters harasses or assaults her. The airport does a cavity search on her. Someone steals her purse and she ends up getting carted off in a police paddy wagon. Babe is left to fend for himself. A family of monkeys is staying in the same hotel and they steal Babe and exploit him in their magic act, which is performed in a hospital full of kids (which explodes). When Babe gets hungrier than he can bear, the monkeys tell him where he can go to get food. They take him to a yard of vicious dogs who chase Babe for 10 minutes. This action attracts the attention of all the animals in the city, who watch the spectacle but don't think for a second about helping poor Babe.Eventually the animals all become friends. One puppy tells Babe something to the extent of his humans tied him up in a bag and threw him out of their car. One of the monkeys becomes pregnant and has babies in the same night. Then animal control barges in and violently captures every last animal in the house, smashing a goldfish tank and strangling Babe on their way out. These scenes were difficult to watch and I'm sure they couldn't film them without some kind of animal cruelty.After some hustle, Mrs. Hoggit gets out of court and goes to find her pig. She runs around the city wearing a clown costume, which she ties up to a runner in a fancy ballroom and bounces around the room for about 20 minutes. If you can't follow me, good. You shouldn't be able to as the outrageous movie makes absolutely no sense.The morals of the movie are 1. Animals are not allowed in cities. 2. People are horrible and will do anything they can to hurt animals. 3. City animals are evil.It is way too violent for kids. It is just plain awful for anyone else. I can't say enough bad things about this movie. It left me stressed out and angry. It was painful to watch.Throughout the movie, my husband would turn to me and say, What the heck was the director thinking!? among some choice expletives. He can stand a little violence. He is in the Army. But the pointless violence in this movie did not make any sense. Keep in mind that neither of us has been around kids for more than a few hours at a time. We were appalled.

It is extremely violent and just plain creepy! The scene where the dog is hanging from a chain and drowning in water was so WRONG. I wish I could put 0 stars for this one. Do not waste your money on this one. This is quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. My husband and I (who are a young married couple with NO kids) bought it as a set with the original Babe movie. The original Babe is an absolute favorite of ours. We were both looking forward to watching this movie. He was practically jumping up and down in anticipation when we put it on. What a disappointment!!! In the first scene, Hoggit has an extremely violent accident in his well and his legs are removed at knees. The Mrs. travels to a seemingly post-apocalyptic city (which is a mix of every major city in the world) in order to make money to save the farm. This city is void of any halfway-decent moral life form. Everyone she encounters harasses or assaults her. The airport does a cavity search on her. Someone steals her purse and she ends up getting carted off in a police paddy wagon. Babe is left to fend for himself. A family of monkeys is staying in the same hotel and they steal Babe and exploit him in their magic act, which is performed in a hospital full of kids (which explodes). When Babe gets hungrier than he can bear, the monkeys tell him where he can go to get food. They take him to a yard of vicious dogs who chase Babe for 10 minutes. This action attracts the attention of all the animals in the city, who watch the spectacle but don't think for a second about helping poor Babe.Eventually the animals all become friends. One puppy tells Babe something to the extent of his humans tied him up in a bag and threw him out of their car. One of the monkeys becomes pregnant and has babies in the same night. Then animal control barges in and violently captures every last animal in the house, smashing a goldfish tank and strangling Babe on their way out. These scenes were difficult to watch and I'm sure they couldn't film them without some kind of animal cruelty.After some hustle, Mrs. Hoggit gets out of court and goes to find her pig. She runs around the city wearing a clown costume, which she ties up to a runner in a fancy ballroom and bounces around the room for about 20 minutes. If you can't follow me, good. You shouldn't be able to as the outrageous movie makes absolutely no sense.The morals of the movie are 1. Animals are not allowed in cities. 2. People are horrible and will do anything they can to hurt animals. 3. City animals are evil.It is way too violent for kids. It is just plain awful for anyone else. I can't say enough bad things about this movie. It left me stressed out and angry. It was painful to watch.Throughout the movie, my husband would turn to me and say, What the heck was the director thinking!? among some choice expletives. He can stand a little violence. He is in the Army. But the pointless violence in this movie did not make any sense. Keep in mind that neither of us has been around kids for more than a few hours at a time. We were appalled.

I managed to catch an early showing and I have to Say this is the BEST (if not only) Christian film to hit theaters since The Passion.Don't let the PG-13 rating scare you off, the rating is appropriate because of the serious issues that are dealt with in this film (divorce, teen pregnancy, drug use, and suicide), but nothing in the film is gratuitous. This is definitely a movie that a Junior High youth group could see without upsetting (most) parents, and the message is wonderful. The best part is this is not a film FOR Christians, it is a Family film without the cheesy 7th Heaven feel.The laughs are there, and several times in the theater everyone was laughing, the bits of humor were natural and didn't seem scripted or forced, and that made for good pacing in such a serious film. Teens and young adult, both religious and otherwise, will be able to identify with many if not all of the characters in the film, and I was surprised to see such issues dealt with in this kind of film. The plot is not in any way predictable, and by the end hits closer to home than many will admit. Christians, fortunately, are not shown as all mighty know it all's of The Word, but instead people just trying to understand life. Humans make mistakes and no one is perfect, not even in this film... not by a long shot.The acting is top notch, the writing spot on, and you aren't hit over the head with all the preachy Christian rhetoric. This is a great film that will make you and your teens think, talk, and perhaps question their own morality (or lack thereof).

It is just plain bad. So it is clear to me that the studios have gotten pretty good at gaming the IMDb rating. I've noticed that ratings are often skewed pretty high on IMDb, and it has only gotten worse. But The African Queen takes the cake in terms of a dreadfully bad movie getting an impossibly high rating for what it is.Why is it bad? The script is like a work of fan fiction, and not in a good way. When you are seeing a movie for the first time and you are completing the actor's lines before they are, clearly it is lacking in any originality. There is zero tension. Even the decent actors in this movie deliver very poor performances. But I think they simply had nothing to work with. There is only so much an actor can do to salvage bad writing. And in this case, there was nothing they could do.And the special effects are very underwhelming. What kills me is that the boats in the Krakatoa, East of Java movie were much more impressive than the shippage in The African Queen, where they simply look like kind of plastic models flailing about in an old wash tub .I won't go on and on about how bad it is because it has already taken two hours of my life away. But suffice to say that this is an extremely uninspired film which I am sure Bogart will rank as one of his worst.And IMDb, the studio owned you on this one.

But death is sad because it takes from us the persons we loved and loved us, those who witnessed our lives or a part of it, those who shared with us the happiest or saddest moments. And death is also the measure of love, as we only realize the value of people when we miss them. And while The Green Mile is set in a prison's death row, but it tackles the subject of death to better highlight the value of love.Love, maybe more than any other feeling, requires patience, trust and understanding. In simpler terms, it takes its time, and so does The Green Mile. It might be three-hour long but like so many great films, it never feels too long, which wouldn't surprise if you consider the name of the director, Frank Darabont. Like its glorious predecessor, The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile embraces the passing of time with a gripping melancholy, leaving us at the end with a haunting sensation, conveyed by the titular metaphor.The Green Mile refers to the last mile walked by the condemned prisoner to the execution, and as explained by the old Paul Edgecomb (Dabbs Greer in a quite moving performance) the floor was the color of faded limes, hence the color. Of course, the distance is shorter than a mile, but when we get to the core of the allegory, we see that we're all sentenced to death (We all owe a death as says Paul) so we all, technically, have green miles of various distances. Paul Edgecomb is the hero of the film and he tells in flashback, a story set in 1935, the very year he met John Coffey, a giant black man, played by Michael Clarke Duncan, sentenced to death for the murder and the raping of two white little girls.To say that Michael Clarke Duncan delivered a magnificent performance would not only be an understatement as gigantic as his body, but it would overlook the performances of the entire cast David Morse as Brutal Howell, the tallest and strongest guard, James Cromwell as Hal, the comprehensive warden and Patricia Clarkson, his cancer-stricken wife. The cast also includes Doug Hutchinson as Percy Whitmore, a sadistic little guard; Barry Pepper as one of the same age, much more appreciated. And in the death row, there's Michael Jeter as the simple-minded Cajun Eduard Delacroix aka Ed, and the pervert Bill Wharton, played by Sam Rockwell. If I add Harry Dean Stanton and Graham Greene in smaller roles, you have one of the greatest casts ever featured in a film.The cast plays a significant part because these are people we care about, no matter how big or small their roles are, each one shines at a moment or another, providing an extra level of depth in characterization, and when they leave us, we can't help but feel something cruelly missing, as if we were really experiencing death as a human loss. But aside from the acting, the directing and the writing are responsible for this level of empathy we feel. Indeed, the film doesn't embarrass itself with subtleties or nuances when it comes to the characters, the guards are all sympathetic and Percy is clearly the main antagonist, doing everything to be unpopular both among the guards and the viewers. And in the prisoners' group, while they're all bad people by society's standards, only Wild Bill stands out as the evil one. In the hand of another director, this wouldn't have worked, but with Darabont it does.Darabont may not be the best director of his generation, nor the best writer, but he's got one rare talent he's a wonderful storyteller. And this talent shows in his films, he has a unique ability to transport you in his universe with such respect and carefulness that you forget all the elements that could undermine the believability of the story. How can the death row's corrections officer guards be so mild-mannered? How wasn't John Coffey lynched at the very minute he was found grabbing two little girls' bodies in his arms, what's more, by a Southern angry mob? Why falling in the 'Magic Negro' stereotype again? I was so mesmerized by the story, and so focused on the supernatural power of Coffey and the bonding it inspired in the block E, that I unconsciously wiped all these considerations.And I enjoyed The Green Mile for what it was, a great MOVIE. And I emphasize the word 'movie' because there's a sort of genius in the way Darabont sticks to cinematic conventions. Darabont never hesitates to use archetypes because he's confident over his material; he knows that his screenplay is adapted from one hell of a story, written by the king Stephen. And it sure pays off, the story has the thrills of the electric chairs scenes, the heart-pounding horrific moment when the machinery goes wrong, it has the laughs, the joy, the emotion, and even a nice little comic relief incarnated by a little mouse named Mister Jingles. And not falling into the trap of anti-death penalty patronizing statements, the film speak much deeper truths about life and death, and the way love play the crucial and sometimes heart-breaking role of a missing link.The film does sometimes get a little too emotional, efficiently taking some tears from our eyes, but even tears can make us miss the more powerful message of the film for men, about the way they can miss the very purpose of life by turning evil, as one of the most insightful illustrations of evil is given, as something that exploits the best side of us for malicious schemes. Like death, you only feel evil, when it takes those you love. The film is too intelligent for its emotionality &#x85; sometimes. But nonetheless, its profound beauty always takes me &#x85; off-guard.

Malcolm McDowell is commanding, and his raspy-voice and stoic appearance imbues vitality to his role as the standard teen bad boy. Behind the camera, Stan Kubrick is more concerned with creating mood and atmosphere rather than showing off or displaying cinematic tricks.This Classic from the eighties is one of the many sci fi films to be produced in England incidentally it is also one of the best. Directed by Stanley Kubrick of 2001 A Space Odyssey  fame A Clockwork Orange is one of his earlier works. The cinematography may not be great but the rest sure is! An interesting and intelligent story that makes for full on family entertainment. This movie will make you smile laugh and cry and bring out all the other various emotions in you. Malcolm McDowell players the bubbly cheerful droogie and Patrick Magee the crippled one who upon discovering the invisibility formula sets out to avenge the worlds evils. Michael Gover played by the greatest villain ever to grace the English screen as the acting Prison Governor. His portrayal still strikes terror into the hearts of kids. Patrick Magee & David Prowse's relationship is more of a homage to the Louis lane Clark Kent type relationship seen in several superhero movies. The rain and wind dance number by Alex. could easily give the new crop of actresses a run for their money. brilliantly acted and executed his dance with the phallic sculpture is simply unforgettable! who can forget that cheeky Singing in the Rain number. you can watch this film time and time again and not get bored. The special effects may be basic but the story and acting are just brilliant. directors and actors of today take a note. Its not just about the visuall appearance. its also about soul that films of today lack which this film is full of. watch it and be truly entertained.In a horror film, this is a definite plus &#x96; and some of the grimy scenery inside the futuristic urban area evokes the dreary and dirty world of David Fincher's Seven. But then again, you do have to ask yourself *is* this a horror film? The answer is ultimately up to the viewer. Give this film a chance and decide for yourself. If you're a fan of the director, actors, or are just craving a solid thriller, A Clockwork Orange comes highly recommended.Other notes ----------- Stephen Spielbarg after watching this film offered both Godfrey Quigley and Amrish Puri a Hollywood film, though Amrish Puri did a film with him, Quigley declined the offer due to his workload in the Phillipines.The verdict ---------- If there's one movie that I am going to recommend to people of all ages, then it is this movie. Watch it on DVD, and live the life of the young kids as they pass through one adventure after another. Plus, have the thrill of saving Alex from the System. You will have everything in this movie. Just go on, watch it and live your dream!

I am not a big horror fan, so I generally stay away from them. But, I could not resist the great reviews, an excellent director, and Jack Nicholson. This movie blends the horror elements and a dramatic storyline together effectively and that is why this movie works.The Shining is about a guy named Jack Torrance who moves in with his family in the Overlook hotel since he will be working there as a caretaker. But little do they know that an evil awaits them in the hotel...Jack Nicholson is definitely at his best in this film. This could be is best role he ever played. He is effective and scary as Jack Torrance. However, I hated the character played by Shelley Duvall. I just found her to be annoying.Apparently, Stephen King was disappointed with this movie. I will admit that this movie does not follow the book closely and it's my favorite King book. But that aside, this is a very effective horror film and may be one of the best ever. I rate this film 9\/10. ","genre":null},{"date":"27 April 2012","score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Stanley Kubrick's The Shining is a work of art.

The acting is so hammy it makes a croque monsieur seem vegetarian. The Great Lord in the film, the father goes potty as his sons fight him and each other for his legacy and power and the script plays this all out so literally and so slowly that you'll be wanting them all to kill each other a lot sooner than they do. Watching this movie is painful...30 minutes in you know you've made a mistake to believe all of the glowing reviews you've read...you know this is not going to live up to any of your expectations...it's not as beautifully framed and filmed as they say and there is no tension or drama because the direction, acting and script miserably fail to build any...the whole movie is a floppy, self-indulgent mess...I'd rather push on a piece of string. After and hour and a half I was depressed at the prospect of having another hour to endure but was determined to go through with it...after all, it's apparently a classic. The next hour passed more slowly than any movie-watching hour of my life as a couple of actors fell off horses (well, were dropped from just above the shot as horses rode past!...it looks terrible!), cherry-red blood was splattered everywhere and the Great Lord (oh, whose make-up by the way was thicker and less convincing than anything in Cirque du Soleil) continued to ham it up in his best I've lost the plot...no, seriously, look at me, I'm running around, I'm staring into space, I'm ignoring everyone, I'm a fruit loop! fashion.
