This is a Jim Carrey movie directed by the Farrelly brothers, what did you expect?  I for one am glad that Jim Carrey has gotten his act together after his Robin Williams-like attempt at real acting.As with most of his movies, the real stars of Irene are Carrey's facial expressions.  He does an amazing job morphing from Charlie, a nice Rhode Island state trooper, to Hank, his evil side.  You can tell he was having a blast.  The other actors do an admirable job of trying to keep up with him, but obviously are eclipsed, especially Renee Zellweger, whose character I didn't care about in the least and really doesn't have much chemistry with Carrey here, despite the fact that they're now dating.That being said, I can't stress enough how grossly offensive this movie is, especially if you are a lesbian, a midget, an animal-rights activist, a schizophrenic, an albino, and\/or a human being with a sense of right and wrong.  It's rated 'R' for a reason.  This is not a movie for people under the age of 17.  Unless you want to be blushing and fidgeting for two hours, do not bring your parents or children to this movie.  Otherwise, leave your morals at the door and have a great time.

After watching A Perfect Storm I think I'll just hop the border with the rest of the cowards.I certainly don't have the bravery to decide to punch through the storm of the century.   I get scared when the waves at the beach get over 5 feet, so I can't even imagine going up against waves ten times that big. Nevertheless, that's what Captain George Clooney and the crew of the Andrea Gail decide to do anyways.George Clooney plays a fishing boat captain who's been on somewhat of an unlucky streak.   While every other boat is making a killing in the fish market, the crew of the Andrea Gail is having problems catching a cold. Word among the crew is George Clooney has lost it.   One crew member even decides to desert to a different boat.So it is with bruised pride that Captain Clooney orders his crew back out to sea for one last trip before the start of the storm season.   At first this trip starts off just like all the rest, badly.   However, the crews luck begins to change once they travel to the Flemish Cap, an area with a lot of fish and a lot of weather as one character puts it.   The Andrea Gale becomes a fishing machine, catching over 60 pounds worth of fish.   That's worth about a quarter of a million dollars once back in port.And so ends the Andrea Gale's good luck.

There's nothing like regaining your pride and a hell of a lot of money to make people forget about the dangers of dying.While the storm sequences in The Perfect Storm are both action packed and emotional, the rest of the movie seems to be lacking the same passion.   The writer decided that the audience wanted to know, or for that matter, cared about the life of a fisherman.   Instead of cool special effects we get a 45 minute long fishing lesson.

Personally, I still didn't care about any of the characters, but I appreciate the writers effort all the same.   In all honesty, I was much more interested in the nameless Coast Guard rescue team, than I ever was in the crew of the Andrea Gail.   At some points I even found myself wishing the movie would focus more on the rescue team, who I saw as the true hero's of the film, rather than the crew, which the movie was trying to make heroic, when really all they did was make a stupid mistake.I feel bad giving this movie a bad review knowing that it's based on a true story.   I don't mean to be disrespectful to the dead, but even the writer knew the story of the Andrea Gail was a little thin, which explains the scenes involving the Coast Guard and the lost sailing boat, both of which have nothing to do with the doomed fishing boat.

(CONTAINS SPOILERS)  One can't expect every supposed epic to be one; after all, Kevin Costner did Dances with Wolves and then Waterworld.  But I did hope for better from Mel Gibson, who had been pretty darned good in Braveheart.  Maybe he should've directed this one, too...no, I don't think that would have helped much.  It was the writing that was most at fault.I studied about Francis Marion when I was a kid living in South Carolina, and as I knew the movie was based (however loosely) on him I had hopes in that direction too.  Unfortunately I think the only thing they had in common was a residency in the state of S.C. and the last names sounded vaguely similar.Mel Gibson has made most of his living from playing reluctant heroes, and like his character in Braveheart, this guy only wanted to raise crops and a family; like Braveheart, circumstances brought him into the war.  There were other things stolen from Braveheart, too...the guys running away and leading the soldiers into a trap; stealing the uniforms and using them to fool the bad guys, etc.  Of course the movie doesn't just steal from Braveheart -- I was shocked to see the Highlander so patently ripped off.  One of Duncan MacLeod's favorite tactics is to kneel, facing away from the bad guy, and then swing around with his sword just as the bad guy steps up for the coup-de-grace.  The climactical riding up with the flag looked like a cross between Gettysburg and Dances with Wolves.The movie wasn't all bad.  I liked some of the minor characters, such as the preacher (played ably by Rene Auberjonois, STDS9's Odo) who left his church in mid-sermon to join the militia.  I just didn't like the politically correct give the girls something to do speech made by the teenaged girl that shamed him into it.  I liked the slave who fought for his own freedom, and everyone else's -- but I didn't like the inaccuracy of having most of the blacks in the movie portrayed as freedmen working on the plantations because they earned a good living doing it...let's get real...if they'd all been freedmen, for Pete's sake, there wouldn't have been another war less than 100 years later.But the things I didn't like outweighed the things I did. One of the things I really hated was having telegraphed punches -- for example, the boy's wedding is so darned happy that one knows quite well something really bad is going to happen.  The bad guy is such a shallow, boo-hiss sort of fellow that as soon as you meet him you know he's going to die slowly and horribly at the hands of the hero.  And the hero himself, a fellow with a past that tortures him, is a mystery to his son -- who must be brain dead not to grasp the situation after he sees his father become a raging berserker the first time.  I wouldn't have wanted an explanation of the tortured past after seeing that.  And good heavens, in a more modern time Benjamin Martin would've spent a fortune in counseling for the two little boys (pre-teens) who participated in the oldest son's rescue, the scene which shows what kind of character Martin is capable of being.There's another thing...the clothing, customs (well, some...though why provide a bundling bag and then allow french kissing is beyond me...) are scrupulously recreated but the dialogue is so modern I kept expecting the people to burst into wow, that was weird or something.  It's as if the movie didn't know what it wanted to be.  It didn't want to be an epic, just a really long movie.  It wasn't like Shenandoah, about a fellow trying to hold his family together in the face of war, though there were elements of it (too many family elements to be easily kept track of for that matter the one son acted like he'd be damaged for life but was miraculously normal by the end of the movie; the little girl hated her father and withdrew from his touch and then, with no clue of why she changed her mind --or why she hated him in the first place-- she loved him).It got confusing -- too many fingers in too many pies. It wasn't an action movie, or a war movie, or a soap, though it had lots of action, war, and lots of soapiness (I'm not my sister!) a really patriotic movie; even Independence Day had more patriotism than this one.  In the motorcycle business there are things called parts-bins bikes, which are bikes built out of leftover pieces. Some work great (the Yamaha Radian) and some don't work at all.  The Patriot is a parts-bin movie, and it just doesn't work.For all one would think the American Revolution would provide a wonderful subject (or even a backdrop) for any movie, the definitive Revolution epic has yet to be made.  It's funny that 1776 is still the best movie about the Revolution, because that's the movie no one would want to take seriously.  But its drama is more convincing, language more realistic, and characters more deep and their motivations more understandable -- even in spite of the singing and dancing -- than the Patriot ever could be.

The climactical riding up with the flag looked like a cross between Gettysburg and Dances with Wolves.The movie wasn't all bad.  I liked some of the minor characters, such as the preacher (played ably by Rene Auberjonois, STDS9's Odo) who left his church in mid-sermon to join the militia.  I just didn't like the politically correct give the girls something to do speech made by the teenaged girl that shamed him into it.  I liked the slave who fought for his own freedom, and everyone else's -- but I didn't like the inaccuracy of having most of the blacks in the movie portrayed as freedmen working on the plantations because they earned a good living doing it...let's get real...if they'd all been freedmen, for Pete's sake, there wouldn't have been another war less than 100 years later.But the things I didn't like outweighed the things I did. One of the things I really hated was having telegraphed punches -- for example, the boy's wedding is so darned happy that one knows quite well something really bad is going to happen.  The bad guy is such a shallow, boo-hiss sort of fellow that as soon as you meet him you know he's going to die slowly and horribly at the hands of the hero.  And the hero himself, a fellow with a past that tortures him, is a mystery to his son -- who must be brain dead not to grasp the situation after he sees his father become a raging berserker the first time.  I wouldn't have wanted an explanation of the tortured past after seeing that.  And good heavens, in a more modern time Benjamin Martin would've spent a fortune in counseling for the two little boys (pre-teens) who participated in the oldest son's rescue, the scene which shows what kind of character Martin is capable of being.There's another thing...the clothing, customs (well, some...though why provide a bundling bag and then allow french kissing is beyond me...) are scrupulously recreated but the dialogue is so modern I kept expecting the people to burst into wow, that was weird or something.  It's as if the movie didn't know what it wanted to be.  It didn't want to be an epic, just a really long movie.  It wasn't like Shenandoah, about a fellow trying to hold his family together in the face of war, though there were elements of it (too many family elements to be easily kept track of for that matter the one son acted like he'd be damaged for life but was miraculously normal by the end of the movie; the little girl hated her father and withdrew from his touch and then, with no clue of why she changed her mind --or why she hated him in the first place-- she loved him).It got confusing -- too many fingers in too many pies. It wasn't an action movie, or a war movie, or a soap, though it had lots of action, war, and lots of soapiness (I'm not my sister!) a really patriotic movie; even Independence Day had more patriotism than this one.  In the motorcycle business there are things called parts-bins bikes, which are bikes built out of leftover pieces. Some work great (the Yamaha Radian) and some don't work at all.  The Patriot is a parts-bin movie, and it just doesn't work.For all one would think the American Revolution would provide a wonderful subject (or even a backdrop) for any movie, the definitive Revolution epic has yet to be made.  It's funny that 1776 is still the best movie about the Revolution, because that's the movie no one would want to take seriously.  But its drama is more convincing, language more realistic, and characters more deep and their motivations more understandable -- even in spite of the singing and dancing -- than the Patriot ever could be.

(CONTAINS SPOILERS)  One can't expect every supposed epic to be one; after all, Kevin Costner did Dances with Wolves and then Waterworld.  But I did hope for better from Mel Gibson, who had been pretty darned good in Braveheart.  Maybe he should've directed this one, too...no, I don't think that would have helped much.  It was the writing that was most at fault.I studied about Francis Marion when I was a kid living in South Carolina, and as I knew the movie was based (however loosely) on him I had hopes in that direction too.  Unfortunately I think the only thing they had in common was a residency in the state of S.C. and the last names sounded vaguely similar.Mel Gibson has made most of his living from playing reluctant heroes, and like his character in Braveheart, this guy only wanted to raise crops and a family; like Braveheart, circumstances brought him into the war.

I certainly don't think we Britons can take the moral highground when we're about to put out our own terrible Enigma-related picture - in this case the movie is called Enigma and no matter how good the acting, direction, production values and score, it will be a dog (with fleas) because the abysmal novel on which it is based almost totally overlooks the fascinating goings-on at Bletchley Park in favour of a cheesy romance and an implausible spy subplot.  Talk about not honouring the memory of those who did the work and won the war...  Though frankly, I have never had a significant problem with movies being historically inaccurate - I see it as a necessary limitation of the medium.  So fine, U-571 isn't historically accurate, but so what?  Is it any good?Frankly, it is not.  Clearly a great deal of effort has been put into the production, hence the sets look authentic, the special effects... effective, and even the much-maligned performances from the likes of Matthew McConaughey and Jon Bon Jovi didn't cause me any problems.  However, the script gives us no discernible characters about whom to care, and the sequence of events therein is completely and utterly feeble.

The boat tips conveniently and said shark slides on deck and bites one of the men through the calf.  This was probably one of the dumbest, most pointless scenes. Precisely because I was just waiting for the fokking storm to come already, and here was this lame action scene which had absolutely no relevance to the characters or the storm.  We hear nothing about this scene before or after, its just kind of thrown in.  And its so laughable.  What looks like buckets of water are thrown on deck repeatedly, so all we see is the water, the deck and the biting shark.If you really must see this movie, I suggest looking for the sheer absurdity in the sharkbite scene, just so you can laugh (at the directors, that is). In fact, if you are looking for a summer comedy, this is IT.I also laughed out loud during a scene where one of the nameless fishermen wakes up with his girlfriend the day he goes off to the boat (there were all sorts of these pseudo-this-is-life scenes which were completely inane) and he notices he has a black eye.  He says something like, Did you do this to me?  And she says very meanly and seriously something like, I dont know. Maybe.  I should have also broken both your legs so you couldn't go on this trip.  Whaaaaaaaaat?  I sat there, stunned, for a few seconds.  My mind just Reeled.  Were we finally getting into some development, where this was an abusive (albeit unconventionally abusive) relationship and the woman is such a cooze she beats him up and then makes references to disabling him so she can keep him around the house?  The question was never answered.  Did she give him a black eye during sex the nite before? (huh? that also seems abusive, if it did happen, or maybe they were really heavy into s&m), or, we are left to guess, did she turn over in her sleep and punch him real hard by accident?  I still have no idea of what this scene was about, and no one in the theater seemed to notice the inconsistencies.  I found myself making up a story that the actor who played the part got in a fight the nite before the shoot, and they had no makeup, and so quickly made up a few lines about the eye in a scene that was supposed to be something else.  It wouldn't have surprised me one bit, considering how slipshod and half-assed the whole movie was.

People seemed to find this hilarious.  I think the humor was supposed to be that she was fat.  It seemed odd in a movie with otherwise very traditionally beautiful women in every scene (except for, of course, any mothers) (even look in the background of the bar scenes, which is on a fishing dock the men look like they haven't bathed in a year and the women look like they spend the entire time in the bathroom dressing in the hippest of clothes, just Dying to catch a fisherman).  It was supposed to be even more funny that the greasy fisherman couldn't get even her.  She even made the oh-so-original comment about him thinking with his other head.The last hilarious scene is in the bar, (almost all the scenes that dont take place on the boat take place on a dock or in the bar) where every single person is drinking budweiser.  (we arent supposed to see that). It's obvious the barset was stocked only with bud, as if, once again, the slipshod directors did not have enough money or brains to get perhaps one six pack of something else just for the shot.

He succeeds in almost every sense of the word. Loving attention has been given to the characters, the work of a fisherman, life in Gloucester, and most importantly, to the Storm itself. When you're watching it, you're there, even if the scene consists only of people sitting on stools at the Crow's Nest, talking.  On rare occasions, the dialogue itself seems forced, though, like it's people talking in a movie and not in a bar. A minor detail.Because Storm's creators wanted us to get to know these men and their families well before setting sail, the film takes a long time to really get moving. Once it does, though, you're grateful you know them as well as you do. The swordfishing scenes--if these guys never swordfished before, which most of them probably have not, I couldn't tell (Markie Mark pulling the insides out of a big swordfish is about as shocking as a movie gets)--shooting in Gloucester, where it all happened, they knew they'd never be allowed to fake it.Whether it was intentional I have no idea, but what Petersen brings across with the Andrea Gail crew is a sense of true displacement--the overwhelming feeling that you're supposed to be somewhere else. We've all been in these situations, though none as perilous as this one. It's like leaving for work, getting halfway there, and realizing you've forgotten the report you'd worked for days on and is due today. You have no choice you have to go back and get it and make yourself late for work. You retrieve the report and drive the exact same route back to work and there it is this powerful sense that this is not the way things were supposed to go. The whole day is now thrown off completely.These fishermen are having the ultimate bad day. Their captain, Billy Tyne (George Clooney in his best performance ever), has just brought them back from a disappointing two months of fishing. Tyne's boss (Michael Ironside) knows just what buttons to push and convinces Tyne to return to sea. This is an easy decision for Tyne--all he has is the sea. He's divorced and his only love is his job. He'd do it for free. His crew is another story altogether. Sure, they love fishing, but they also need the money desperately. Swordfishing is a gamble. Like many industries, you put in a lot of time and resources into it, making many sacrifices, without knowing what the return will be. Tyne's &#145;no guts, no glory'-type speech convinces them to go along for the ride again--only days after they've returned from the last run.From the beginning of their journey, the crew members pour the pressure on their captain to make it worth their while. This is a last-minute, unplanned trip. They're not supposed to be there. Before the storm even hits, the bad karma surrounds them like fog besides having even worse luck catching swordfish than their last run, one bizarre small disaster after another happens along the way. This approach is what makes William Wittliff's script so great. He uses these incidents to build the intensity, capping it off with the famed super-storm.I can honestly say that this is the best work I've ever seen from ILM (Industrial Light and Magic). Never have special effects been more crucial to a story and executed so effectively. The storm scenes--when the lightning flashes, briefly revealing mountains of black waves--are at once beautiful and terrifying.Petersen brings it all together nicely. He puts his characters (and from what I've heard, his actors as well) through hell. As the voyage takes a turn from being an ill-advised journey to transport 64,000 pounds of swordfish back across the Atlantic to being a desperate struggle for survival, you can see it on the characters' faces they've never been this close to death--and they're loving every minute of it. How can we not do the same?

The story is simple genetically mutated bats escape from a lab and the scientist who created them gets the help of two bat experts who get the help of the sheriff (Phillips) to hunt down their flighty foes.  The special effects are bad.  The only time the CG of the bat swarms look convincing is from a distance.  When the bats aren't cartoonish CGI they are animatronics that look more like monsters rather than bats.  In one scene, the bat expert Jimmy, says to the scientist, If one of those bats toutches me, if it moves his head around (while saying this he rolls his head on his shoulders) and even seems like it's going to LOOK at me, I'm comin' after you!  When Jimmy is desribing the bats head movement, it seems almost like he is making fun of the way the puppet bats move around.  The bats also vary in size from a regular sized bat to a large bat with a wingspan of about 4 feet!  The people in this movie are idiots!  An officer is cornered by a group of bats in a diner, and all he has to say, with gun pointed at them is, Stay back, don't move!  In another diner a customer is getting mauled by a large bat, but the little kid near him doesn't notice because he's too involved in an arcade game.  I could go on more about that, but I won't.  The scientist character is a poor weak character (not really the actor's fault, more the writers) upon getting a hold of a bat, the scientist, stereotypically says, I must study it!  And, (WARNING! SPOILER AHEAD!) it turns out that our beloved scientist released the bats on purpose, as he later reveals.  That whole plot surprise right there is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen. So this guy decides to be all evil and for NO REASON WHAT SO EVER, except just to make him a bad guy, he releases these aggressive, carniverous bats on a small town.  Stupid.  I actually kept slipping in and out of sleep during the end.  This movie is terrible in most aspects.
