Both comedies regards gangsters torn between their professional and personal lives. Title is totally lame but it is the name given to Hugh Grant who is an art auction dealer shocked when Jeanne Tripplehorn refuses to marry him. At first I figured it was because this is a shitty movie, but as it turns out her father is a gangster and she fears that he will have Grant running illegal favours. This indeed does occur and Grant ends up auctioning very expensive paintings. Then a series of events lead to Grant being blamed for the death of the son of another mob leader. Although the setup is amusing the delivery is repetitious with a contrived ending. Kelly Makin does fine as director but this is nowhere near as funny as her earlier comedy Brain Candy. While Grant pulls off humour effectively James Caan as his father-in-law is typecast and predictable. Tripplehorn labours under uninteresting material and is involved in an ending that is too stupid for words. Then we have Joe Viterelli as a carry over from Analyze This as if he just couldn't play any other role. Misfire comedy laden with clichés. It is enough to make Mickey close his blue eyes in order to erase the memory.
