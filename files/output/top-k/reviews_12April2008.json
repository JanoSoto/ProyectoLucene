Later, I started playing an X-Men video game, and during my comic book phase, I do recall reading some X-Men ones. Since then, the comic book series has been one of several to get the live action movie treatment at some point within the past ten years or so. I didn't see too many films on the big screen back in 2000, so I didn't see this this first X-Men movie adaptation. I finally watched this about a year and a half after going to see its sequel, X2, but I have now seen it more than once, and it is good.In the near future, many mutated humans exist. They are born with a special X-Factor gene, which gives each of them a certain superpower. Unfortunately, these mutants are generally feared by the rest of humanity, even though many of them mean no harm. In the X-Mansion, where many good mutants live, Professor Charles Xavier runs a school for students with the special X-Factor gene, where they learn how to use their gifts wisely. Xavier dreams of a society where mutants can live with the rest of humanity in peace. However, another mutant named Eric Lensherr (a.k.a. Magneto), who was once Xavier's friend, has different plans. He has a machine that can convert non-mutated humans, and he plans to speed up the process of human evolution with it! For some reason, one unbeknownst to anyone in the X-Mansion, Magneto and his evil mutants are after either Logan or Rogue, two recent arrivals at the mansion! Comic book movies from recent years are generally not known to be flawless, so it's no surprise that X-Men has some fairly weak moments. After the first scene, which is set in 1944, and the story skips to the near future, where the rest of the movie takes place, the film gets pretty shaky, starting with Rogue in her room with her boyfriend, just before she discovers her powers. I would say the story really gets good around the part when Logan (a.k.a. Wolverine) first finds himself in the X-Mansion. After that, it doesn't stay completely steady for the rest of the film, but usually is pretty entertaining, with a decent amount of action and suspense, as well as good special effects, some intriguing futuristic sets, and occasional humour. I can't say TOO many of the cast performances here really stand out, but those of Patrick Stewart (as Xavier), Ian McKellen (as Magneto), and Hugh Jackman (as Wolverine) do. The script isn't perfect, but for the most part, it's better than the Hulk and Catwoman scripts (two very disappointing comic book movies), that's for sure. Here, there's a mixture of strong and weak dialogue and acting.So, overall, this first X-Men movie does have its cheesy moments, but that certainly doesn't mean it has no entertainment value. Now, some people strongly dislike these recent comic book movie blockbusters in general, and if you're one of them, I'm sure saying that this one has its cheesy moments is a gross understatement to you, if you've seen it. However, if you don't like this kind of movie, it's simple, don't watch it. For those whose interest is often captured by comic book movies like this, there may be some films of this kind which are best to avoid, most notably the more poorly received ones, but X-Men certainly isn't one of those, even if it's not the best adaptation of a comic book series ever made.

Yes, as a superhero film it is a lot more sombre and certainly more constructive than recent comic book efforts and the latter Batman films but on its own, it is a nice to look at and somewhat entertaining film that falls short due to sloppy execution of good ideas. I like the fact that the only green screen you'll get in this comic book effort are the background long shot city effects, but for the 1980s perhaps this is all they could do. I also enjoyed the essence of noir that the film carried in its shapes and shadows on the walls (there is a nice example in an office when the blinds create a shadow) and the city of Gotham is a towering and intimidating spectacle.But although Batman contains the essence of noir, it doesn't follow through enough to be labelled as one. Sure, it has its ditsy blonde woman in Vick Vale (Basinger) who is along to be looked at, rescued and nothing much else. It has its moody anti-hero in Batman\/Wayne (Keaton) who has a foot in both camps of vigilante and Gotham's rich and famous and yes, it carries that element of crime and that feeling of criminality. There is also the fact the film feels as if it is taking place in the 1940s (the golden era of noir in Hollywood) what with Tommy guns and pinstripe suits here and there. But nothing ever goes beyond the point of a visual example.So what actually is this film? It's an on and off love story that is cute and nicely unfolded with the two meeting; meeting again; going on a date; dealing with domestic issues such as one half of the relationship lying; going through a tough time and then breaking off completely, although Wayne as Batman must still rescue Vale. But it is nothing much more than that and in that sense it is nothing more than recent efforts 'The Holiday' or 'The Lake House', which were better because they didn't need the hero to rescue said love interest from the clutches of a villain. The problem is that Vale is just too loose. She seems smart and educated enough to be in a job with a newspaper but when it comes to being independent or strong-willed, she needs men to aid her. The finale in a high tower as a (dark) knight in armour must rescue her from the hands of evil is ludicrous and a centuries old method of story telling.So apart from an iffy love story which I'm sure was as familiar then as it is now, what do we have in terms of story? Well as perfect as you like, the hero's past tragedy has something to do with the villain involved which is done interestingly in this film and, like the love story, is unfolded nicely when all is revealed but it's nothing more than a visual example. What I cannot understand are the inconsistencies and general humorous\/evil mentality The Joker (Nicholson) is supposed to possess. Jack Napier starts out like any other criminal in a 1940s noir with his suit, bodyguard and ties to both the underworld and the police but we spend very few scenes with this character. Instead, we get the incident that transforms him and suddenly he's someone else. What I can't understand is why the event that changes him would transform him psychologically as well as physically. Napier's mental state is one of a psycho which is established through past newspaper readings but he is calm and unfunny in his presentation of himself; once he becomes The Joker, he suddenly relegates himself to the level of a clown, merely because he looks like one which is just silly. There are scenes in which the balance to what's a musing to us, him and generally disturbing that blur the boundaries. Scenes such as the hand buzzing, the balloon parade and the museum defacing &#150; is this supposed to make us laugh or is it supposed to fill in time over a weak, centuries old story.Then there is the sub-plot that appears and disappears involving The Joker. He develops some sort of serum that makes you laugh, smile broadly and then die which he infects somewhere in Gotham City. So, all of a sudden the film is about germ warfare? What else does The Joker do? Part of the reason I liked Batman Returns so much is because the villain (Penguin) integrates himself with the people; polluting and conning people as he moles his way in and eventually runs for mayor. He has something to do but here, nothing much happens and Joker's idea just acts as a reason to further ensure love and trust between Wayne and Vale. But Joker's inconsistent motivations don't stop there; he is in love with Vale from the moment he sees her and yet his Museum proposition is to deface her as she becomes his own &#150; why change her face if she's already stunning in your opinion? Maybe he's just insane but why should we have to suffer through silly narrative-drives because of it. There are parts of Batman that are reasonably good and Keaton anchors the film down with his downbeat and depressive approach to Batman. But the film is more about The Joker &#150; he is more energetic; does more and appears more often. Batman\/Wayne is there to fall in love and foil the baddie when required, simultaneously getting his own revenge in the process. Everything is executed well but there's not a lot here to execute in the first place.

That's the commanding power of this film. It has something for everyone - young and old, for the typical summer movie lover to the hardened film critic, this movie has it all.There are so many, many things that I like about this movie. Firstly, there are the action sequences. They are big, grand and spectacular in every sense. Since this is an Arnie\/James Cameron movie, you know it's gonna be big. From the storm drain chase to the Cyberdyne police shootout, it is massive. Hordes of stunt-men are present here. You can tell they are dedicated when doing their job. #1 rule of action movies - always have a LOT of stunt crew around.Next, the acting. Arnie is used to being Arnie, but instead of that, and also the creepy, relentless killing machine in the first film, here we see him as a worthy hero and protector, who will do anything to protect John. Some moments in the film shows the Terminator's humanization, an element which gives the movie more credit. To which I recall Arnie, do your stuff. But, truth be told, Arnie gave a better performance as the villain in the first film than in this. Linda Hamilton is also highly commendable as Sarah Connor. In the first film, we see her as the damsel-in-distress, in this one, she's a gung ho commando mom who will do anything to protect her son. This also shows that she is a changed woman, both physically and mentally, as her adventures in the first film have shaped up into this Sarah, and we can't help but cheer for her. Edward Furlong also gives a charming performance as young John, who develops a strong father-son bond between his cyborg protector, an element which serves as the emotional theme for the movie. And, who would not review this movie without mentioning Robert Patrick's chilling and menacing portrayal of the seemingly indestructible and invincible T-1000? The cinematography is great. Adam Greenberg really picks the right scenery for the film to make it feel more epic. The city of Los Angeles have never looked this wide. Also, the night scenes were incredibly shot, especially during the Cyberdyne shootout. The dark scenery is joined with a great dark yet heroic atmosphere which gives the film yet another one of its key elements, although frankly speaking, in terms of atmosphere and mood, my vote goes to the first Terminator movie, no contest.The music - Brad Fiedel returns to give us not only his signature synthesizers, but also to give a new orchestral arrangement for the heroic tone of the movie. His score is fantastic, and the music fits the right places at the right moments. I wish I could hear more of Fiedel in the near future.This movie wouldn't have been possible without the special effects and makeup. This film is one of the first movies to fully take advantage of CGI, but only, repeat, ONLY, during scenes with the T-1000. This is great, because limited CGI means more time for real pyrotechnics, gun-play, and vehicular play as well. VERY unlike the films made today, an example would be Transporter 2. So stylized and so unrealistic. Thankfully, and possibly hopefully, Hollywood have learned its lesson and will probably continue making old school action films, with action films like Live Free or Die Hard, Casino Royale and recently Rambo, which are all done old school style. That being said, the CGI in the film looks terrific and does not at all look aged. The makeup effects are also good, with realistic metal skull revealings. Both these elements easily surpass the first film.Finally, I would have to comment on James Cameron, who wrote, produced, and directed this blockbuster. He practically delivers fast-paced, kinetic direction, and knows how to build up tension as well. As for the story, some may criticize it for being too redundant to the first (which I agree), but I think that Cameron has done a tremendous job for turning the dark and moody atmosphere of the first into a rip-roaring, no holds barred action adventure. And, giving us moral insights and predictions of machines turning against their creators. Really, if not for Cameron, then who? Overall, I think this is one of the finest films ever to grace the silver screen, and as of today still stands as a colossal and grand masterpiece few can beat. However, in that said few is the first Terminator, which is better than this film.But that's just me being a harsh critic.Now, being the little kid I've always been, this is my favorite movie. I first watched it on VHS when I was 6 years old in 1997 and since then I have watched it more than a dozen times and I never get tired of it. It's a film that will probably never grow old or outdated. This movie not only sparked my interests in movies, but also made Arnie into my favorite action hero. This film is the reason why I've decided to pursue my dreams into becoming a film director (after seeing the hard work and dedication the filmmakers put in while watching the documentary in the Ultimate Edition DVD), and also why I continue loving movies today. This movie is an inspiration to us all, and I strongly recommend anyone - anyone at all, to watch this film. This film, one or not on its own, is a masterpiece.10\/10Delton.

The dark scenery is joined with a great dark yet heroic atmosphere which gives the film yet another one of its key elements, although frankly speaking, in terms of atmosphere and mood, my vote goes to the first Terminator movie, no contest.The music - Brad Fiedel returns to give us not only his signature synthesizers, but also to give a new orchestral arrangement for the heroic tone of the movie. His score is fantastic, and the music fits the right places at the right moments. I wish I could hear more of Fiedel in the near future.This movie wouldn't have been possible without the special effects and makeup. This film is one of the first movies to fully take advantage of CGI, but only, repeat, ONLY, during scenes with the T-1000. This is great, because limited CGI means more time for real pyrotechnics, gun-play, and vehicular play as well. VERY unlike the films made today, an example would be Transporter 2. So stylized and so unrealistic. Thankfully, and possibly hopefully, Hollywood have learned its lesson and will probably continue making old school action films, with action films like Live Free or Die Hard, Casino Royale and recently Rambo, which are all done old school style. That being said, the CGI in the film looks terrific and does not at all look aged. The makeup effects are also good, with realistic metal skull revealings. Both these elements easily surpass the first film.Finally, I would have to comment on James Cameron, who wrote, produced, and directed this blockbuster. He practically delivers fast-paced, kinetic direction, and knows how to build up tension as well. As for the story, some may criticize it for being too redundant to the first (which I agree), but I think that Cameron has done a tremendous job for turning the dark and moody atmosphere of the first into a rip-roaring, no holds barred action adventure. And, giving us moral insights and predictions of machines turning against their creators. Really, if not for Cameron, then who? Overall, I think this is one of the finest films ever to grace the silver screen, and as of today still stands as a colossal and grand masterpiece few can beat. However, in that said few is the first Terminator, which is better than this film.But that's just me being a harsh critic.Now, being the little kid I've always been, this is my favorite movie. I first watched it on VHS when I was 6 years old in 1997 and since then I have watched it more than a dozen times and I never get tired of it. It's a film that will probably never grow old or outdated. This movie not only sparked my interests in movies, but also made Arnie into my favorite action hero. This film is the reason why I've decided to pursue my dreams into becoming a film director (after seeing the hard work and dedication the filmmakers put in while watching the documentary in the Ultimate Edition DVD), and also why I continue loving movies today. This movie is an inspiration to us all, and I strongly recommend anyone - anyone at all, to watch this film. This film, one or not on its own, is a masterpiece.10\/10Delton. ","genre":"Action, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"12 April 2008","score":"12 out of 16 people found the following review useful","review":" This movie is a rarity - if you manage to catch it on TV while channel skipping, you don't change the channel anymore; you just SIT DOWN AND WATCH. That's the commanding power of this film. It has something for everyone - young and old, for the typical summer movie lover to the hardened film critic, this movie has it all.There are so many, many things that I like about this movie. Firstly, there are the action sequences. They are big, grand and spectacular in every sense. Since this is an Arnie\/James Cameron movie, you know it's gonna be big. From the storm drain chase to the Cyberdyne police shootout, it is massive. Hordes of stunt-men are present here. You can tell they are dedicated when doing their job. #1 rule of action movies - always have a LOT of stunt crew around.Next, the acting. Arnie is used to being Arnie, but instead of that, and also the creepy, relentless killing machine in the first film, here we see him as a worthy hero and protector, who will do anything to protect John. Some moments in the film shows the Terminator's humanization, an element which gives the movie more credit. To which I recall Arnie, do your stuff. But, truth be told, Arnie gave a better performance as the villain in the first film than in this. Linda Hamilton is also highly commendable as Sarah Connor. In the first film, we see her as the damsel-in-distress, in this one, she's a gung ho commando mom who will do anything to protect her son. This also shows that she is a changed woman, both physically and mentally, as her adventures in the first film have shaped up into this Sarah, and we can't help but cheer for her. Edward Furlong also gives a charming performance as young John, who develops a strong father-son bond between his cyborg protector, an element which serves as the emotional theme for the movie. And, who would not review this movie without mentioning Robert Patrick's chilling and menacing portrayal of the seemingly indestructible and invincible T-1000? The cinematography is great.

","genre":"Action, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"12 April 2008","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Kubrick has done a good job of transposing the story from novel to film, with a screenplay by the author, Vladimir Nabokov.James Mason is outstanding as the snooty but distinctly human professor Humbert Humbert who falls in love with the nymphet named Lolita, Sue Lyon. And Shelley Winters is great as Lyons' mother, Charlotte Haze. The script sticks fairly closely to the book, although some collapsing and elisions are inevitable. I doubt, though, that Nabokov actually was responsible for the shooting script. It was his first and last screenplay.Having said that, it has to be admitted that the film has weaknesses, compared to the novel. For one thing, Kubrick refused to shoot outside of his new homeland, England, and only some skimpy second-unit shots are used to convey the sense of motion across the US map. The novel captures perfectly some quotidian images from American -- a red neon sign in the shape of a coffee pot blinking on and off, the shadows of poplar leaves on a small town's honor roll in the afternoon sunshine. Nabokov was a butterfly hunter and kept careful notes of these observations while traveling around the West in search of prey. Dolores, Colorado, was one of those towns. All this local color is missing from the movie.And if most of the cast consists of seasoned professionals, some of the performances fall flat. Poor Sue Lyon. I understand she was fourteen when this was shot but she looks about seventeen. The original Lolita -- the reason the story was considered shocking at the time of publication (1958) and still is by some people -- aged from twelve to fourteen while under salivating Dr. Humbert's tutelage. She was a bright but vulgar kid. Sue Lyon resembles a glossy starlet and hardly utters a believable word. (She was to improve later.) Quilty the guilty is played by Peter Sellers. He has about five roles. Some are fine, such as the psychologist Dr. Zempf (German for mustard). Others, such as his faux detective at The Enchanted Hunters, sound poorly improvised -- to the point of discomfort.That just about gets the weaknesses out of the way. Oh -- there's a bit of slapstick when the hotel porter brings a folding cot to Humbert's room and the two men try to unfold it without waking the sleeping Lolita. It's like a Laurel and Hardy routine, and it's been criticized by some as not fitting the template, but I don't agree at all. The situation itself is absurd -- horny Humbert grimly determined to seduce Lolita while at the same time drifting in and out of sleep. In the novel the scene is hilarious and poetic at the same time. Humbert lies next to Lolita (no cot in the book) and listens to the night noises of the hotel -- the clattering elevator, the guy in the next room puking up his liquor into the toilet, the loud ladies in the hallway -- and if you can't have those prose jokes you can at least have a hotel porter bonked on the head by a cot that insists on folding itself back together.The novel is richly comic and Kubrick's movie comes about as close as we're likely to get to capturing some of its humor as well as its pathos. I don't know why some easy laughs are omitted from the film though. In the book, when the desk clerk mispronounces his name, Humbert replies with indignation, The name is not Hamburg and not Humbird, but rather Herbert -- I mean Humbert. (Maybe nobody else finds that funny.) Compared to Adrian Lynes' later version, featuring a splendid actor, Jeremy Irons, this one is funnier and sunnier. Lynes' Clare Quilty, the villain, is a shadowy and witless heavy, while Peter Sellers is snappy and tormenting, and as bright as Humbert, as he should be, since they're brothers under the skin in their lust for Lolita.There isn't space to get into much of this but I should add that this is not a story of pedophilia. The fact that Lolita is too young, by our standards, is beside the point, the point being that Humbert has fallen into one of those traps common to most of our lives -- falling deeply in love with someone who is willing to play with you but then forgets you the moment you're out of sight. This is a love story by any measure. In the novel, the scene in which Humbert and Lolita meet for the last time is immeasurably poignant. And, really, we have to feel a little sorry for Humbert's possessiveness. Imagine being a middle-aged man with a resentful and straying wife. Now imagine a middle-aged man whose barely pubescent daughter is angrily establishing her independence from the household. And the wife and daughter are one and the same. Doubly cursed.Watch this, if you can. And then -- here's a thought -- read the novel if you haven't already.

I mean, I like this film. It keeps me watching the screen at all times (a rare occurrence), but there are so many things that are left as sloppy. I never believe that Cusack is a real hit-man- Ackroyd's that fat & he can't shoot him despite using that many bullets????I don't believe that Driver ever was angry with our hero- Cusack walks in after TEN years and she slaps him once 90 minutes into the flick???And my personal favourite- the Estate Agent friend, who hasn't seen Cusack in a decade, finds him sitting next to dead body and helps him stuff the corpse in the school furnace not uttering one word.

People have been recommending the movie to me literally for several years, and I never got around to watching it until last night, after I recently purchased the trilogy for a whopping 30 yuan (about $4.25), thanks to China's total indifference to copyright laws. The movie is suitably depressing and highly artistic, and although some of the technical experiments didn't really work for me, the story itself is outstanding. Early in the movie there is a clumsy use of a flashing blue screen that might remind some Hitchcock fans of the psychological use of color in Vertigo, but it's one of the examples of the overuse of blue in the movie that came to me to be a little redundant. The movie is called Blue and it's an emotional color, I don't think we really need to be hit over the head with it so many times. Juliette Binoche stars as Julie Vignon, the wife of a famous composer who dies in a car crash, along with their daughter, throwing her entire life into total emotional chaos. She responds by trying to erase her memories of her lost past. She sells all of her possessions, moves to a new place, and goes back to her maiden name. Throughout this time, she immerses herself in her sadness, just like that astonishingly blue swimming pool.Obviously, music is an extremely important part of the film, it takes us on an entirely separate journey through Julie's sadness and emotional development. The movie illustrates her loss of feeling, her inability to form meaningful connections with other people after her catastrophic loss, and through the thoroughly unexpected turns of events that take place throughout the movie to allow her life to continue, in completely unexpected directions. There is a lot of focus on minute details in the film, long shots that focus on seemingly trivial objects but that create a surreal environment that is almost impossible to create in any other way, similar to the effect that Binoche gets with her particular style of under-acting. There are a few moments in the film when the screen fades to black for a few seconds and then fades back in to exactly the same shot. I imagine Kieslowski was going for some kind of temporary mental blackout, triggered by an emotion or a sudden painful memory, but it just came across as campy to me. Nevertheless, the movie has such a powerful and involving story that it's easy to overlook things like this, although this is certainly not the feel good movie of the year. By far the film's best feature is the story, which is brilliantly written and takes us on a fascinating journey, followed by the stupendous performances. Kieslowski is not one of our most accessible directors, but certainly one of the most enduring.

Although I absolutely despised it the first time, I decided to give it another chance. Terrence Malick is clearly a well-respected director, and it seems that the IMDb viewers, at least, think very highly of the film. But, unfortunately, it seems my tastes haven't changed at all.Where to start? For one thing, Linda Manz's narration is horrific. Her voice is so irritating with that horrendous New York accent (please don't try and convince me that Chicagoans talk that way - they don't). She herself admitted to just sitting down and talking about random things, which does not make her a talented actress. She's not even acting! I came on IMDb expecting to see her ripped apart, since her performance is just so utterly laughable, but people actually seemed to like it! She's simply unappealing in every way - I kept hoping Malick would just kill her off.The other actors were fine, but certainly nothing special. Adams was probably the strongest in the cast, but she also had the only decent part. Except the old guy - he was pretty good.Speaking of acting, how could Shepard's character be so ridiculously stupid?? He bought the brother and sister act because...uh, why would he buy that? Bill and Abby took every single opportunity to be touchy-feely, as though they didn't realize that their lives depended on acting in a very platonic way. It was just completely unbelievable. And finally, after a considerable amount of time, the Farmer suddenly realizes that, Oh my god, they're together! Then he goes after Bill with a gun, but instead seems to trip into Bill's hand and ends up with a mortal stab wound.Speaking of which, the fate of the characters was similarly stupid (and, dare I say, lazy). Of course Bill has to die - could it be more boring than getting shot in a pond by a pack of cops? Abby goes on with her happy life, getting on a train and feeling really content about the way things worked out. And the irksome narrator randomly finds her deadbeat friend and they wander off into the sunset. But it's okay, because Malick never gave me any reason to care about the characters anyway.As for the plot, this film drags along endlessly with no real plot twists or development. I can't believe it's only 94 minutes long - I could have sworn I was sitting in my seat for a solid 3 hours. The sudden locust disaster was like throwing the Bible in my face; I'm totally fine with metaphors and allusions, but this was completely over the top. Clearly the message was, Don't marry for money or bad things will happen to you. Very original.I understand that Days of Heaven, like all of Terrence Malick's films, is meant to be a piece of art.

While not a Tyrone Power fan, I do love Basil Rathbone (one of the most versatile and underrated actors ever, in my opinion), and I thought I'd give the swashbuckler a try.Throughout the picture I kept having this sense of deja vu. I finally realized it was that so many scenes were almost direct replica's of the Flynn\/de Havilland masterpiece Adventures of Robin Hood. Alas, The Mark of Zorro lacks Robin Hood's ideals, charming\/witty\/inspiring dialogue, pacing, depth of acting ability, terrific score, and just about everything else.Tyrone Power has never struck me as a believable actor in any of his roles. He always seems to be on the surface of the lines rather than being immersed in a character or urged from within. His comic flares work fine in this movie but we never really get a sense of the outrage or the intensity that would fuel an outlaw. Flynn, on the other hand, has numerous scenes written specifically to show both his compassion for the underclass and his contempt for corrupt rulers. The two pictures have eerie similarities, down to the day-for-night shooting of chases on horseback. And Friar Tuck -- or is it Pah-dray Somebody? -- confuses the issue more. Linda Darnell is niece of the al-cal-day, mirroring de Havilland's being the ward of Richard I. Of course, de Havilland wipes the floor with Darnell, partly because she's given fantastic scenes with wide scope for character development and partly because she's by far the better actress.The two memorable aspects of this picture for me are the duel between Power & Rathbone and -- oddly enough -- the performance of the Zorro stunt double riding his black horse through the town. The swordplay is everything everyone says it is -- a wonderful example of the art. Power was a trained fencer and it shows! (He clearly wasn't a trained dancer, which also shows.) The intensity and speed of the swordplay is beautiful to watch. As for the stuntee, I found myself mesmerized by the ease with which (presumably) he handled the horse, making quick, light turns and looking for all the world like a centaur. Wonderful horsemanship (I suppose the horse should get some kudos, too!). Some of the best I've seen on film.I really wanted this picture to be better than it was. It had lovely costumes and some nice photography but is no match for the stirring epic that it so clearly seems to be imitating.

While not a Tyrone Power fan, I do love Basil Rathbone (one of the most versatile and underrated actors ever, in my opinion), and I thought I'd give the swashbuckler a try.Throughout the picture I kept having this sense of deja vu. I finally realized it was that so many scenes were almost direct replica's of the Flynn\/de Havilland masterpiece Adventures of Robin Hood. Alas, The Mark of Zorro lacks Robin Hood's ideals, charming\/witty\/inspiring dialogue, pacing, depth of acting ability, terrific score, and just about everything else.Tyrone Power has never struck me as a believable actor in any of his roles. He always seems to be on the surface of the lines rather than being immersed in a character or urged from within.

The twist is so shocking, I will avoid the overwhelming temptation to give it away, watching it in ignorance will ultimately have the best effect.The cast is superb, Hollywood superstar Bruce Willis gives a refreshing change of pace performance as award winning child psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe. Joining him is the critically acclaimed child actor Haley Joel Osment, last seen in Artificial Intelligence. The acting talents of this young boy are phenomenal, I have never seen such powerful presence, he is mature beyond his years.Haley thoroughly deserved recognition in the form of an Oscar nomination for his role as 'Cole'; a gifted young boy with the exceptional ability of having the sixth sense. Possessing this gift however only serves to create fear in the mind of a nine year old, and scepticism in everyone around him. Cole experiences terrifying, unwanted visits from the spiritual world, which inevitably leads to his social isolation. Dr. Crowe recognises Coles behaviour, and remembers many years back when he had a patient with the same symptoms. This patient however left a painful impact on his conscience, as he was unable to help. Dr. Crowe then seeks to redeem himself by doing everything in his power to help troubled Cole.As Cole is alone in seeing and hearing these suffering spirits, it is also he who must help them rest. To do this Cole must confront his nightmare.

We can overlook the fact that there is no training montage and that Rocky does not step into the ring. We can accept the stylistic departure from Rocky IV because Balboa continues in the vein of Rocky V. We can get past the unrealistic plot point of Rocky losing all of his fortune, because we see he finds a way to get by in Rocky Balboa.There are still some things that are simply bad in Rocky V that Rocky Balboa does not make acceptable, namely the fight at the end. Rocky V does not build naturally to a fight - this is a movie that is ultimately about overcoming hardship and the complexities of family life. The fight did nothing to conclude that story - it seemed contractually obligated. It is also strange that his son magically ages several years during the few months that Rocky is in Russia.Still, it is an acceptable installment in the series, if not an acceptable ending.

Hornikerrom character, who seems totally distraught, focus in a concise way the subject of this movie.My first 14 years old's vision, in 2003, made me smothering, I remember the atypical Television and the Taped Cassette of bad quality. Since my childhood, I fancy the American way of Life of the 70's,The Doors,the Beatnik Movement...the First thing I've noticed was the Photo's Grain which, by the 35 mm Camera, brings me back to this other frigid and airtight America, Obscure as Hell, with the munificence of the Edward Lachman's cinematography. Secondly, Every word, simple, deep and full of life, used by the Narrator, aka Ribisi, flows to my ears like a poem, it runs through my head, my veins..like the poison. Sofia Coppola by depicting in a realistic and haunting way the life and death of these five teen girls, from a conservative and puritan married couple( nice played by Woods and Turner), blew away my eye on girls for the rest of my life. Gradually I was looking the movie, I felt more and more touch, and it gave me the impression of being beside they. The music composed notably by the French Band Air ( yeah !! ) which is dreamy, subtle and slight, leads this smart work to dreamlike Lands ( as the Boys ' Lux Dream, i cried when she died). The casting is awesome, notably Hartnett who makes an nice effort since H20.Moreover, when my eye came to rest on Kirsten Dunst, it was the love at first sight, Lux represents all the stake of the film, the inherent conflict which seems to animate every girl. Then I remember me when i was watching Spiderman in the theater, asking my self who's that beautiful red hair girl? She's a stone fox ! it's her !, Since this date, I idolize her, she's my favorite actress and to my mind it's her best performance.In my feel, by transposing the Eugenides's epic fresco, this first trial shot by Sofia Coppola is a master stroke, this movie is full of grace and enigmas like his creatures.
