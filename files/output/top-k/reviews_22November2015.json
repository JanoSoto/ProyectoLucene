The acting is on par and the directions is pretty darn close to perfection. The Shawshank redemption is one of those films that is designed to make you think, and boy does it do its job. The screenplay is possibly one of the greatest ever scripted. The way it cleverly weaves in and out is extraordinary. Stephen King should be proud that a film like this originated from his book.

In real life, obviously, people wouldn't react that way, and that's makes this a hardly black humor of a picture.

Case in point, Don McKellar's Canadian knocking-on-Apocalypse's-door flick, Last Night. Throughout the film, I was wondering if there would come a point where the revelation as to why or how the End of the World was coming around. There isn't any, or at least something that has a clear definition. But there are eerie signs of something just 'off', and it comes with the mere presence of the sun at first I wasn't thrown off by the sun being out at 6 PM, even 7 PM (the time-span for Last Night is 6 hours, 6 PM to 12 AM on the dot)... but the sun doesn't set, it just stays there and doesn't go away. Now that's scary - and certainly convenient for a budgetary perspective.This is a low-budget movie that takes the apocalypse as something serious, but not in every single moment. In fact McKellar's approach is to make this at times almost 'quirky', eccentric, and even awkward comedy. At one point Patrick, character McKellar himself plays, is having a big dinner with his family and some old family friends. The mother starts to cry at the table, but no one really goes to console her or to say anything, they just keep on eating the turkey and lamb she's prepared - this is the kind of scene I might expect on the TV show Louie, where misery turns out to be uproarious comedy all based on the timing and the personality of the characters in this dreadful situation (in other words it IS a serious moment, but funny because of the reactions and how people feel about one another in that moment). And there's a whole sub-plot with a character who has been, over two months, going through sexual conquests like a check-list... and he finally approaches his friend Patrick about being a, uh, part of that.The main thrust of the story is how Patrick and Sandra (played by Sandra Oh, no name change apparently) go about their last 6 hours, with some assorted characters drifting in and out like Sarah Polley as one of Patrick's disaffected teenage siblings, and David Cronenberg as a bureaucrat going about his last business in a giant office to call people in this city to tell them about the gas staying on until 12 PM, with pretty much every call being a voicemail. But it's less about the story of it than just following these people and finding how they deal with this despair, or not deal with it, and while some go out in the streets and loot and kill and pillage (the film opens with Sandra's car being flipped over as she goes into an empty store to get some items for no good reason at all except it's apocalypse time, better flip some cars and stuff).There is some dramatic power here too, though in small doses and in large part coming from Sandra Oh's performance (I'd forgotten how good she can be, such as in Sideways or on the HBO show Arliss, where she was good enough for me to remember decades on). She carries a lot of weight just by the nature of her circumstance she has to find her husband so they can carry out their simple plan together at the stroke of midnight - not being able to find a car makes things further complicated, and Patrick makes interesting by how he reacts to her plight. He's not someone who is a super-take-charge kind of guy, but he's not about to sit in the corner with his family and give up either; he's the sort to approach everyone with some decency, even in the midst of befuddlement (i.e. being approached for sex by a male friend, in a sort of 'well, it's on my list and all' sort of rationale).At times I wasn't sure if McKellar was great for the part he wrote for himself, but at other times I don't know if anyone else could play off the awkward tension and sense of sympathy (and empathy) he carries across. He gets good work out of everyone here, most notably Cronenberg - always an underrated actor - as the man who always followed the clock and still is following it until his end (my favorite scene in the film is when he is met with a young man with a gun in his hand, who isn't sure if he can shoot him, though he may just do that, one of those moments that FEELS so real and raw).This is not to say every moment in the film entirely works, or that every attempt to be funny in its soft-cringe like manner is effective, and it actually takes a few minutes early on to gather some momentum. But there's a rhythm to it that is unique, lines like the one in the summary above that come from the heart, and there's a constant sense of 'let's try something you may not have seen before with a 'This is The End' story, down to its ambiguity around why things are ending (or for how long), and some of it comes down to it being so darn... Canadian. You may never see another apocalyptic movie with so many polite people!

The Santa Clause starring Tim Allen is a movie that starts off with a feeling that it hasn't got it right, it's going to be another movie that tries to be fun and sweet but all together falls off the rails. This movie however feels alright, it's funny at times and does have a sweet centre in fact even sometimes you feel for the characters which quite often in these type of movies they start to falter the more you see of them. The story see's Tim Allen's character Scott basically become Santa as he well knocks him off his roof and then puts on the suit meaning in the Santa Clause he is now the jolly red suited man. We then see Scott really become Santa, only his son knows he is Santa, everyone else thinks he is crazy, things transpire and the whole story comes to an exciting end.It's well done this movie I mean even from a technical point of view and even though maybe watching some years after it can look outdated, it nevertheless still looks pretty cool. One of the things I felt this movie nails is the whole look of this, it's bright and full of colour and the North Pole when it is seen is fantastically built and the extras make for a great effort to create a nice atmosphere. The movie can suffer in parts through one too many fart jokes and not all the jokes hit the mark, but the movie still suffices in the way it is mostly funny. Tim Allen does well in his role, at first comes across as unlikeable but as the plot grows he matures as a character brining with him fun and that jolly feeling you need from the lead of a Christmas movie. After directing this, John Pasquin continued to work with Tim Allen and you can see why, he gets the most out of Allen and really the cast too, it can at times feel like some kind of made for TV movie and the directing isn't brilliant, but Pasquin makes the most out of the script and the film all in all satisfies. The writers create a script that works very well for a family feel of a movie and they create a story that is a nice one to direct and act in, it feels as mentioned before very sweet and although never truly strikes the heart immensely, still leaves you feeling a little for the characters involved.It's schmaltzy in moments but ultimately rewarding for anyone who has a heart, don't expect too much from this and you could be pleasantly surprised by this. The movie spawned two sequels by the time of review in which really although it deserved a second film, it does work extremely well as a single piece and one that is nicely enjoyable for all. It's also very much a plot that doesn't feel that different to those you may see in other Christmas movies however really the whole reason this movie for me is OK and a reasonable watch is that it manages to make you laugh but also touches the part of you that secretly is still a kid.

After directing this, John Pasquin continued to work with Tim Allen and you can see why, he gets the most out of Allen and really the cast too, it can at times feel like some kind of made for TV movie and the directing isn't brilliant, but Pasquin makes the most out of the script and the film all in all satisfies. The writers create a script that works very well for a family feel of a movie and they create a story that is a nice one to direct and act in, it feels as mentioned before very sweet and although never truly strikes the heart immensely, still leaves you feeling a little for the characters involved.It's schmaltzy in moments but ultimately rewarding for anyone who has a heart, don't expect too much from this and you could be pleasantly surprised by this. The movie spawned two sequels by the time of review in which really although it deserved a second film, it does work extremely well as a single piece and one that is nicely enjoyable for all. It's also very much a plot that doesn't feel that different to those you may see in other Christmas movies however really the whole reason this movie for me is OK and a reasonable watch is that it manages to make you laugh but also touches the part of you that secretly is still a kid.

After completing a new novel up in the middle of nowhere, he races back to civilization to deliver the draft. Big mistake, a freak snow storm makes him lose control of his car and crash. Luckily he is saved by a woman who lives in the area. She takes care of him while he is bed ridden and luckily for him, she is his number one fan. Based on the Stephen King novel, Misery takes fan admiration one, two, maybe three steps too far. We enter the world of Annie Wilkes, a deranged woman who will stop at nothing to keep her favourite author locked up in her house, just to have him all to herself. At first, she seems like a lovable do-gooder. She won't swear, she's overly nice and humble. Things start to crack here and there when she doesn't hear things that she likes. Violent outbursts, stone cold stare downs and even sledgehammers make it into the mix. That sledgehammer scene by the way, which is arguably the most famous scene in the film, still makes me cringe even though I've seen numerous clips of it over the years. Extremely well done in my opinion. On the flip side of that, the scene when someone smacks their head on the typewriter...horribly done. Laughably, horribly done. That's the one hiccup in this otherwise, tightly directed film. I was surprised by the amount of talent behind the camera. Reiner directing, William Goldman adapting the story from King and Barry Sonnenfeld as the cinematographer. All three of these areas are highlights of the film. Without reading the book, I get the sense that Goldman managed to get the best adaptation of the work possible. Reiner gives us many scenes of unnerving tension, heightened because our lead protagonist can't even walk. Sonnenfeld captures the cold wintery landscape beautifully in scenes and really lets us feel the isolation. The real standout is of course, Bates. In her breakout role, which won her on Oscar no less, she commands the screen with oddity. She even makes snorting like an exciting pig seem perfectly fine, yet still oddly out of place in her role of Annie the psycho Wilkes. Every scene she was in, I had no idea what to expect. Will she be happy, mean, excited, deranged or dangerous? Sometimes she'd be all of them in a matter of seconds. An outstanding performance for sure, one that could have crippled the film is not done as well as she did. Caan manages to hold his own against her. I feel he has just as difficult a job in that he is restricted from using his body as much as one would like. He relies more on his facial expressions than anything else, he has to. Of course there is Richard Farnsworth, he is a lovable goofball here as the Sheriff. He delivers his lines with such soft, caring and humorous attitude that he almost feels like he should be in a different film. All three performances here are great and deserve recognition.

And just like all of his reappraised works, is a classic that unveils more of its intricate layers on multiple viewings.Set in New York City, Eyes Wide Shut tells the story of Dr. William Bill Harford whose life spirals out of control when his wife tells him about an erotic fantasy she had about another man which shatters his faith in her. Unable to get the image of his wife & the other man out of his head, he embarks on a night-long adventure during which he comes extremely close to cheating on his wife & also infiltrates a quasi-religious sexual ritual at a country mansion after learning about it from a friend.Co-written, produced & directed by Stanley Kubrick, Eyes Wide Shut is a film about sexual desires that's jam-packed with symbolism & metaphorical elements. The entire film exhibits a sexually charged atmosphere and every single character inhabiting it has nothing but sex on his or her mind. Kubrick's direction makes efficient use of all his trademarks and just like before, he manages to push forward the existing boundaries of the medium while adding a few innovative tricks into the filmmaking manual in the process.The screenplay smears the plot with multitudes of themes & insinuations, the story unfolds in a slow, methodical manner, the leading characters have an in-depth complexity which is wonderfully illustrated by the master storyteller, each sequence is meticulously detailed & technically refined, and it has a lot to say about sex, infidelity, physical relations, desires & fantasies. However, dialogue isn't one of its strengths for every time anyone says anything, the other character repeats the same as a question which becomes annoying after a while.The technical aspects always score very high marks in Kubrick films and Eyes Wide Shut is no exception. The set pieces are gorgeously rendered, extensively detailed & beautifully lit. Cinematography encapsulates the entire picture with a bizarre, dream-like ambiance which goes on to further amplify the overall experience while also intensifying its erotic attributes. The use of colours is noteworthy while lighting here is a work of perfection. Its 159 minutes of runtime & deliberately slow pace may feel like a challenging ordeal but it never becomes an issue once the drama sets in.The incorporation of classical songs to compliment the unfolding drama continues in Eyes Wide Shut and all the musical arrangements are wisely chosen & carefully infused into the storyline. Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, Sydney Pollack, Marie Richardson & Todd Field. Even though both Cruise & Kidman put in commendable effort into their respective roles of Mr. & Mrs. Harford, it's actually their on- spot chemistry that makes them click so well, and while there are no definite stand-outs, the contribution by its entire cast only works in the film's favour.On an overall scale, Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut may not be as pathbreaking as most of his masterpieces but it's nonetheless a deeply fascinating meditation on sexual relations and despite its cynical tone, manages to be an erotic, enthralling & engaging thriller. While the plot is heavy & explicit in sexual content, approaching it as a sex-romp cinema won't do enough justice for Kubrick digs much deeper into the primordial aspects of human nature to put up an exquisite looking tale that's aesthetic, artistic & unlike anything before or since.

Sleepaway Camp clung to the summer camp motif that began three years prior, as well as a particular camera angle that was first effectively used more than two decades earlier. Clinging even harder to the franchise that first began making teens afraid to attend any summer overnights, the movie opens years before its initial time setting, demonstrating a borrowed need to establish a rhyme and reason for the inevitable blood shedding.After a tragic incident while swimming in a lake (sound familiar yet?), Angela (Felissa Rose) attends a summer camp along side her protective cousin Ricky (Jonathan Tiersten), who despite his small frame is willing to stand up to anyone for his introverted cousin. After being introduced to the crusty ex-gym teacher looking camp owner Mel (Mike Kellin), whose attempts to cover up each murder as accidents, we are quickly thrown into the cruel world that befalls Angela. As the body count rises, so does the bullying, allowing for multiple suspects to open up within the realm of psychopaths; could it be Angela, the one being bullied, or Ricky, the aggressive protector, or possibly Paul (Christopher Collet), Angela's new admirer?Throughout the film we are continually guessing, as director Robert Hiltzik admiringly utilizes the first person camera established back in 1960 with the then controversial film Peeping Tom. After being re-established in John Carpenter's Halloween, and again two years later in Friday the 13th, its use is still as effective as ever, allowing us to bare witness to the slaughter head on, while keeping us guessing until that final shot.What kept the slasher genre running strong in theaters back in the day was its innovative, gory, and clever means of killing off hapless bystanders, attempting to give audiences its moneys worth. While Sleepaway Camp certainly doesn't bore the average gore seeker, it doesn't bring anything new to the table, with the most exciting kill feeling like a tribute to Lucio Fulci's The Beyond. Where the film truly excels is its perverse nature and promiscuity, wrapped around a well structured murder mystery. Even after the final shot is revealed and we're given a twist ending not seen since Norman Bates donned his Grandmother's wig, the suggestive perversion sits with us, seeping into our skin well past the credits.While Sleepaway Camp handles material that had been utilized before in a much sleeker and effective manner, all that doesn't stop it from becoming one of the defining slasher films of its time. It doesn't quiet sit up on the throne with the likes of Halloween, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, or Friday the 13th, but with it use of the first person camera and a twist ending sure to make you tweet everyone you know, Sleepaway Camp has taken its post amongst cult- horror, and it isn't going anywhere.

","genre":"Horror"},{"date":"22 November 2015","score":"","review":" Sleepaway Camp was released in the early heyday of 80's slasher films, sandwiched between Friday the 13th (1980) and A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984). Sleepaway Camp clung to the summer camp motif that began three years prior, as well as a particular camera angle that was first effectively used more than two decades earlier. Clinging even harder to the franchise that first began making teens afraid to attend any summer overnights, the movie opens years before its initial time setting, demonstrating a borrowed need to establish a rhyme and reason for the inevitable blood shedding.After a tragic incident while swimming in a lake (sound familiar yet?), Angela (Felissa Rose) attends a summer camp along side her protective cousin Ricky (Jonathan Tiersten), who despite his small frame is willing to stand up to anyone for his introverted cousin. After being introduced to the crusty ex-gym teacher looking camp owner Mel (Mike Kellin), whose attempts to cover up each murder as accidents, we are quickly thrown into the cruel world that befalls Angela. As the body count rises, so does the bullying, allowing for multiple suspects to open up within the realm of psychopaths; could it be Angela, the one being bullied, or Ricky, the aggressive protector, or possibly Paul (Christopher Collet), Angela's new admirer?Throughout the film we are continually guessing, as director Robert Hiltzik admiringly utilizes the first person camera established back in 1960 with the then controversial film Peeping Tom.

While The Rescuers Down Under underperformed, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King later became big hits. Unfortunately, Pocahontas, while turning a decent profit, didn't do that well with critics. Because of that, Disney needed some help. They managed to co-produce with a CGI animation company known as Pixar to release their very first computer animated feature known as Toy Story, a story about a cowboy doll named Woody who becomes jealous when a new space toy named Buzz Lightyear becomes top toy to his owner named Andy. One day, when Woody knocks Buzz out the window, he becomes despised and after reuniting with Buzz, they get separated from their owner and end up in a house owned by Sid, a boy next door who destroys toys for fun. Because of that, they need to come up with a plan to make it out alive. But first they need to overcome their differences in order to do so. I remembered seeing this film as a child on VHS and loved it. Twenty years later, it's still a beloved classic and there are a lot of things to talk about. First off, the story is very well-written. It displays some themes of jealousy, friendship, being a toy that makes you special to your owner, and what it means to go Infinity and Beyond. Also, it has some of the best comedy I've ever seen as it has lots of laugh out loud moments including a scene where Buzz starts acting a bit crazy after pretending to drink some tea with some dolls in the I'm Mrs Nesbitt sequence and the You Are A Toy where Woody shouts at him that he is a child's play thing and Buzz replies You are a sad strange little man and you have my pity. *makes a Vulcan gesture* Farewell. However, the most important thing about the story is it's heart and it's moments are handled really well. Like the scene where Buzz realizes that he's nothing but a toy which leads to the song I Will Go Sailing No More from Randy Newman which would leave everyone in tears, but the most important scene in the movie is the iconic To Infinity and Beyond sequence where Buzz and Woody are flying in the sky after freeing themselves from a rocket. That scene itself is and always will be the most epic part in animation history. There's a lot more good things to discuss as well like the animation. I'll admit it doesn't hold up that well after twenty years due to some of the human character animation that look like toys than actual human beings. But to it's credit, this was Pixar's first computer animated movie and some of the animation in Toy Story works to it's advantage. Like the textures of all of the toys and some incredible details like that spoon (seriously, it looks really neat). The pacing is very brisk. At it's 81 minute length, it's never too fast, but it's never too slow either and it takes it's time to let the dialog flow and it does it perfectly. The music score from Randy Newman is really beautiful and well-composed with it's light-hearted tone while balancing it with it's serious moments and the songs are really good. Whether you love Randy Newman or hate him, you can tell that he's actually a good singer and his songs You've Got A Friend In Me and I Will Go Sailing No More hit the right notes by being memorable songs. Then, there's the voice acting and it's really spot on. Tom Hanks does a fantastic job as Woody, a cowboy doll with his wit, sympathy, and realizes that others are important to Andy as he is. Tim Allen is great as Buzz Lightyear, a space toy with wit and confusion as he figures out whether he's important to Andy or not. Their chemistry together is the heart of the movie since it's a tale about putting aside each other's differences and working together which strengthens it to it's advantage. The side characters, including Bo Peep, Mr. Potato Head, Hamm, Slinky, and Rex, voiced by Annie Potts, Don Rickles, John Ratzenberger, Jim Varney and Wallace Shawn are never annoying and are very funny. The human characters are also good too and Sid, while nothing special as a Pixar villain, is still very menacing he reminds you of a bully at high school. Toy Story started the trend of computer animated films and other production companies such as DreamWorks Animation, Blue Sky Studios, and Illumination Entertainment to do the same. While some of them rely on style over substance, there are some that had the same heart and creativity and competed against Pixar for nearly two decades and it's still going as of today. Toy Story and later films such as Monsters INC, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Ratatouille, WALL-E, and Up is what made Pixar so compelling because of their heart that helped them earn their critical acclaim. What I'm trying to say here is that computer animation is what made the industry so successful it convinced Pixar to do the same in the late 2000s' which they also succeeded. Not because of the writing, not because of the characters, and not because of their heart, but because of one thing imagination. It convinced DreamWorks Animation to do the same and they lived up to them just that on movies such as Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, and How To Train Your Dragon. So, overall, Toy Story is not only one of the best Pixar animated films ever made, but one of the best CGI animated films that will always go To Infinity and Beyond forever.

The story follows a young teenager living in 1985, Marty McFly, who, accidentally is teleported back to 1955, using a Time Machine out of a Delorean. The most is extremely entertaining, and whether you enjoy the humour, the Sci Fi or both, you are sure to be entertained either way.Roberts Zemeckis direction helps the film reach fullest velocity. His script, which he also wrote, is very original and creative. Just Imagine if Back to the Future was never made, it's almost impossible to think about. The film is great entertainment for young and old, and sure will be a memory in your mind forever.

I think the alien looks awesome but when I watched the movie I was disappointed. You barely get to see the alien and most of the time when you do it just shows a shot of it and you only get to see it kill someone like once or twice. It dragged on. For most of it I was bored out of my mind. The part where the alien crawls out of the guys stomach was pretty cool and towards the end when ripley tries to catch the alien is pretty good but in general its pretty boring.They could have shown a lot more of the alien and actually shown it kill people. Its mostly people just talking and for a lot of it they're talking about things that aren't even relevant to the story. A lot of people really like it and thats fine but I didn't. It could have been better ","genre":null},{"date":"22 November 2015","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" I heard really good things about this movie and I thought it would be awesome.

I'm originally from India and was in diapers when this movie was released. I'm in the USA now and getting closer to thanksgiving this year, I sort of understand what it means to be alone during thanksgiving. For that this movie is closer to home for me. Everybody loves a road trip especially if there is an adventure in the offing. This is what I realized from the movie, that there are plenty of lonely people out there during this season. Sure we are different from each other but thats the good stuff. If we can find it in us to put up with each other we can each drive out everyone's loneliness. At the end Steve Martin realizes just that, overcomes his biggest inhibition, the fear of strangers, and invites Mr. Del Griffith back home for the holidays. Its a feel good movie with an amazing end and for that I gave it 7\/10. ","genre":null},{"date":"22 November 2015","score":"","review":" I've been watching a lot of movies on Netflix lately.

He lives in New York city with his girlfriend (Elisabeth Pena) working as a post-office clerk. We learn also that he has two kids from a previous marriage, although nothing is revealed about his ex wife, namely if she is still around and if they still keep in touch because of the kids. He also has a PhD. The couple appears to go along well but certain things do not seem to fit in. Singer appears to 'see' certain ghost-like images and experiences delusional episodes. At some moment he is approached by a strange man and an old army colleague who hint that the army experimented with some untested chemical even to American soldiers during the war.Jacob's Ladder is an interesting film, which however tries to be too many things at the time. For a big part of the film the tension was built towards conspiracy theories, nonetheless there was also an angle with strong supernatural elements that defied any logical explanation. That's not necessarily bad but such a contrast took away from the overall credibility of the movie.Anyway, the film tried to balance between such possible scenarios and eventually ended with something that seemed like an easy way out. In any case, I enjoyed the movie's atmosphere but be aware that there are some loose ends. Danny Aiello's role is also to be noted, although I felt afterwards that his role was inserted not just to provide a meaningful resolution to the protagonist's struggle but also to explain things to us (the audience). A 7\/10 from me. ","genre":null},{"date":"22 November 2015","score":"","review":" Jacob Singer is a Vietnam War veteran.
