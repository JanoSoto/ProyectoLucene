While watching An Ideal Husband, I didn't object to the lack of suspense as long as Rupert Everett was working his way around those Wilde lines, which he does as well as anyone I've ever heard.I used to think Stephen Fry was Wilde on earth, but Fry is something wonderfully different -- Everett is Wilde on earth, or at least the actor that Wilde should have had around to deliver those lines when he wrote them.

He seems to have squandered an outstanding cast.  The play's final scene is played as a series of French scenes -- a film term for a series of different scenes in the same location -- and this kills any momentum that scene might have had.Three out of four stars, I say, which makes it better than 90% of the movies out there.

Good characters, powerful acting, a good story, and pure realism are often the keys to inspired film making. What's Eating Gilbert Grape fully understands this simple formula for success, and provides the viewer with a honesty that very few films today possess. The strangeness of the title does not match the film's premise. Johnny Depp, an enjoyable presence in film in recent years, plays the title character, a young man who lives a completely selfless existence, but who never gets much of an opportunity to please himself. He has his near-18 year old mentally challenged brother, Arnie (Oscar-nominee Leonardo DeCaprio, in one of his first major roles) to tend to, as well as his 500-pound mother (Darlene Cates), who has not left the house in over seven years. His other two sisters take his sacrifices for granted, leaving Gilbert without much moral support around the house. He works at a second-rate supermarket, whereby he becomes acquainted with a lonely housewife (Mary Steenburgen) who turns to Gilbert for a little more than delivery of her groceries. It is only once a drifting girl named Becky (Juliette Lewis) comes along that he is able to find a true soul mate, someone who can help him momentarily escape from the chaos of his everyday life.The aspect about Gilbert that I really admired about his character was the fact that he did not think of himself as a particularly good person or even a help to others, but rather someone who was fulfilling an obligation to those around him, whether it be within the home, at the grocery store, or being friendly with Steenburgen. He follows what he believes must be followed, and in many ways is trapped, without a sense of freedom. What is even more heartbreaking about Gilbert is that the ones who should have been appreciative of his kindness did not give a damn about whether they were affecting his life. Real emotions are clearly at stake here.From what I've described about Gilbert Grape, it would seem that the film is a sobfest. Not so. Leonardo deCaprio deserves a great deal of credit for bringing spirit to the movie, a true innocent within the family. He is so free-spirited that Gilbert, as well as the audience, cannot help but love the guy despite his being a major chore to take care of, and sometimes a real pain in the rump. DeCaprio deserved his Oscar nomination, starting off his prosperous career in Hollywood.Another thing I was really surprised about was how Gilbert's mother, while being amazingly overweight, is not treated as a stereotype by the filmmakers. Darlene Cates, in her film debut, brings real heart to a role that could have been completely one-sided. She lives a life that she herself never intended, but learns to make the best of it.Films like What's Eating Gilbert Grape always let you know when they're working by how much you feel for the characters in its story. I honestly felt for Gilbert and what he had to put up with, and truly hoped he would find a happy ending once the film was over. Of course I would not dare reveal that ending to you, but let's just say there is a sense of satisfaction that arises as Gilbert Grape finds the spirit within himself he thought was never there.

There are no scenes that scream out HEY LOOK AT US!  WE'RE YOUNG, WE'RE TWISTED, DON'T YOU WISH YOU WE'RE US!?  Okay maybe it has a few, but none of them feel like they exist strictly for shock value, none of them feel the least bit contrived or unnecessary.  That is what makes Sid and Nancy so great. Most film criticism stems from reaction to prior film releases. Reviewers like Siskel and Ebert tend to cling to comparisons as a safety blanket, and as an almost cop out for original thought.  Director Alex Cox (Repo Man) tells a story of doomed love that tends to defy easy categorization.  Its brilliant combination of ultra realistic biography and surrealistic conjecture create a film universe that had not been seen prior to its release. The film opens in a dingy New York City, Chelsea Hotel room.  Sex Pistols bassist and Punk Rock icon Sid Vicious (Gary Oldman, in a staggering performance) is being questioned by police about the apparent murder of his girlfriend and world famous rock n' roll groupie Nancy Spungen (Chloe Webb, Twins, TV's China Beach).  Smash cut to the punk rock era of 1977 London, where Sid meets Nancy in a world of anarchy and disillusion inhabited by kids who don't know quite what they are disillusioned about.  After a brief first encounter there is no chemistry between these two classic lovers, but soon Nancy sees Sid at a Sex Pistols gig, jumping around on stage freely showing his lack of musical ability and its love at first sight.  (Note it is a documented fact that Sid Vicious barely knew two chords on the bass guitar.)  When Sid, after asking Nancy to cop some heroin for him, bashes his head against a brick wall in a twisted attempt to empathize with her, Nancy's love is only reaffirmed by Sid's complete abandonment of personal safety.  Before we know it the two are shooting up the drug, which immediately begins a cycle of codependency that only desperate youth could satisfy.  So the question arises are they really in love?  Or do they need each other to support their habit? Well the question is answered, at least in Alex Cox's eyes, in a scene where the Sex Pistols play a gig on a riverboat, which ends violently in a police clash with Sex Pistols fans.  As the boat docks, the punk rock youth pour onto the dock to escape the Billy clubs.  Sid and Nancy casually stroll through the chaos unscathed as if they know that their love will protect them. As corny as the above event my sound, Alex Cox quickly juxtaposes with a scene of pure brutal addiction where we get to witness one of the most frantic fiending for drugs scenes ever shot. Sid and Nancy's desperation does not only make us cringe, it also makes us laugh with a classic comic topper that has to be witnessed to gain full appreciation.  There in lies the beauty of Sid and Nancy, a locomotive of a film that is always on the verge of jumping the tracks, but is saved at the breaking point by carefully placed contradictions that more often than not makes us laugh. As if the above were not enough to make an engrossing movie, the film is also a great example of integrating historical events into a story without distracting the viewer from the film's unifying themes.

Sid and Nancy is a great anthology of the rise and fall of a social movement, which behind the spiked hair, and leather jackets, was a dead on assessment of the hypocrisy that existed in England and the United States circa the decadent 1970's.

Something About Mary had me laughing, Big Daddy had me holding my sides, and South Park had me shocked but humoured.  American Pie is heads and shoulders above any of these films.  What makes this film so funny is not only its attempt to humour us, but its honesty in every scene.  And that honesty can bring us back to what it was like to be there.  So whether you lost it ten years ago, yesterday of even five minutes ago, you can relate to the feelings that this movie has.It is three weeks before the prom and four friends have made a pact to get laid before the end of prom.  The four friends consist of a guy who has been dating a girl for quite a while but hasn't gotten past third base.  Another is a shy guy that has problems doing his  business  at school because of cleanliness issues.  A third is portrayed at first as the quintessential jock that just wants to use his athletic prowess to meet the ladies.  And finally we have Jim.  Jim is the guy that you see in the commercials.  He is so sexually inept that when he tries to talk to a girl, he shies away before any words will leave his mouth.  And when he has a naked girl in his room, he  blows it  twice, before he can get the prize.The most interesting situation was how the jock  OZ  grew in this movie. He started off as a typical jock.  Then he meets a girl that he really likes.  And suddenly he doesn't just want to have sex, he really cares about her and at the end when we see them together, it makes you feel warm.  It is their relationship that makes you remember what it was like to really like someone for the first time.There are many other delicate and poignant scenes in the film concerning love.  Kevin and Vickey's relationship is a tricky one because they both really like each other but she is not sure if she wants to take that last step.  This causes some friction in the relationship, but when it is resolved, it is written so convincingly that you are happy for them.This film combines some true intelligence and romance with a wickedly funny look at the complexities of sex.  And nothing is sacred here.  They explore female and male oral sex.  They talk in depth about orgasms and of course masturbation is a big topic in this film.  And that makes it side splittingly funny and incredibly witty.  American Pie really is a miracle. It was written by Adam Herz and this is his first film.  And judging by his ear for dialogue and character, he will be around for quite some time.The one performance that I wanted to call attention to was Chris Klein as Oz.  I wasn't sure where I had seen him before so I looked him up in the IMDb.  And he was in Election.  And he was great in that film too.  But here he is honest and sincere in his performance and he lends credence to his character.  He is very good in American Pie and I believe he will go on to do bigger things in Hollywood.So if what you are looking for is one hilarious film and you like Something About Mary (tripled) kind of humour, then this is your movie.  If you don't like that kind of film, don't even bother to see this film.  But you are missing a true treasure.  Thsi film reminds me a bit of a combination between The Breakfast Club and Fast Times.  So check it out.  You will laugh and you will cheer when you walk out of theater.  The only bad thing about this film is that it ended.One final thought is that you should really beware of the chicks in band that play the flute.  ( Wickedly funny!! )Wonderful movie!

My babe Mary is this singer who just left her 51st, or 63rd, or 102nd guy and goes right after her 52nd or 64th or whatever, who is this guy who used to be a fisherman but due to 'unforeseen circumstances' isn't one now.  But since way up there in fish country winters are long and women are scarce and fish just don't last all winter he decides she is all right, and besides she is Mary Elizabeth Maistrantonio.    Anyway, he and she and the teenage daughter decide to go for a boat ride, so off they go along with his long-lost half-brother who decides to pull a con on his half-bro and use him as a bodyguard for some stupid pigheaded easy money drug deal.  But of course it ain't easy money, and so it's a man overboard and everyone swim for their life scene.We got fish being cleaned, fish being shot, fish being canned, fish being fish, we got pretty postcard pictures of somewheres up in Alaska which looks like they got enough trees to build all of us a 5000 square foot house, we got losers in a bar with their own barstool, we got Robinson Crusoe only Friday is a babe and her daughter, and finally we got an ending that just goes to show that we don't really know what's going to happen in our lives.Three and a half bright north stars.  Go check it out but only if you want to watch a movie where when it's over you want to go back for more.

This film turned out to be clearly one of the best movie going experiences I have had in ages. We see this as the story unfolds and is creatively told through the reading of the violin makers wife's fortune with a deck of Tarot cards. It is the story of a part of the life of a violin; of the humans who would dare to possess her beauty. A masterpiece of a craftsman's art, it is desired by many for it's acoustic perfection. But, as Tolstoy said, how complete is the delusion that beauty is goodness.

There are even some deluded ink-wasters who resolutely believe that 'Elizabeth' is a great movie. All I can be bothered to say about this drawn out costume drama is that it's nothing more than a big-budget yawnfest - the contemporary genre Hollywood takes proud credit for.Writer Michael Hirst and director Shekhar Kapur deliver a goose egg that promises a lot and delivers nothing. Feminist inklings abound in this profile of the most famous of monarchs in British history - set in the 1500's, those days when Prince Charles may have been relevant and when royalty was taken seriously, even though they ponced, posed and postured in frilly underwear that made Adam Ant look conservative.The overrated cast are another baffling element in a series of baffling elements, considering the kudos and awards they received. Cate (I believe that going from anemic to vacant with absolute gusto is good acting) Blanchett, Geoffrey (now that I've won an Oscar I can underplay drama) Rush, Richard (present solely to offer credibility) Attenborough, Joseph (if anyone else says I look like Cary Elwes I'm going to just spit ) Fiennes, and John (I can do a wonderful impression of John Gielgud) Gielgud.What a tedious and long-winded film this is - 123 minutes that seemed to last longer than the bronze age - I've seen better film around my bath-tub. The question I have to ask here is, how did this motion picture receive such acclamation and the subsequent awards? Obviously, politics in the film industry is a delicate balance and if you play by the rules while groveling shamelessly, you'll be well and truly supported, defended and sustained.That may be the reality of cinema politics, but a film on its release to the public has very little to hide behind. If the final product is less than adequate, the studios will try to manipulate opinion with a barrage of publicity, plugging, PR, puffery and promotion.

No, instead the gross humor is a medium for a decent script that winds up working well, very well! The plot is about four high-school seniors (Jason Biggs, Chris Klein, Thomas Ian Nicholas, & Eddie Kaye Thomas) who make a pact, that they are to lose thier virginity by the time they graduate.  The idel time to score is on prom night, so all four guys are working and preparing for prom night.  Oz (Chris Klein), a jock, joins the jazz choir to impress another choir member, Heather (Mena Suvari) and to show that he too can be a sensitive guy. Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) wants to give his current girlfriend Vicky (Tara Reid) the perfect moment while having sex. Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), is acting very smooth and charming, trying to impress the entire senior female class with his outrageous rumors. And then there's poor Jim (Jason Biggs) a young man who is at his sexual peak, and has a crush on the foreign exchage student named Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth). From there on is a rollercoaster with the same equivalent as a Six Flags rollercoaster, of non-stop laughs and gross out jokes.  How would I compare this to other comedies as thrill rides?  AUSTIN POWERS 2 and SOUTH PARK are the scary kiddie rollercoasters.   BIG DADDY is the wild, but not scary of the rollercoasters, like a medium thrill.

But Tarzan looked like it had such fun animation that I wanted to go see it.  But let's not worry too much about why I went to see it, let's instead worry about what it was like.I'll start with the good points  First, the animation was fantastic.  Not a single moment in the movie fails to live up to the high standards the preview leads you to expect.  I would say the animation was not quite up to the level of The Lion King - mostly because the jungle canopy world of Tarzan is inherently confusing, so evoking it well gives a sense of magic, but not of realism.  9.5 \/ 10.Music?  Well, the songs were good and I like Phil Collins, so that was a plus.  They didn't fit as well into the movie, though.  I wouldn't classify Tarzan as a musical the same way I would classify most of the recent Disney movies as musicals, because the fact of the matter is, all the songs are background music to certain action sequences.  The characters, for the most part, don't sing.  Also there was less music than the other movies, or at least it seemed that way...  Let me put it this way this was nowhere near The Little Mermaid in musical quality - the songs seemed to be a gesture rather than central to the movie.  7\/10.Humor.  Truth be told, Disney Animated movies haven't been comedies for a long time.  But there are enough funny sight gags and such to keep the tone of the movie light even at serious moments.  Kind of what you would expect. 8\/10.Lastly, we come to the plot.  The plot is actually important in this kind of movie - the Lion King wouldn't have worked at all without its plot. However, Tarzan falls significantly short of the excellent mark we have come to expect from Disney.  The story is pretty simple to start - A mother and father with their baby get shipwrecked, and live in a home on the shore. Unfortunately, the parents are killed.  At the same time, a gorilla loses her baby to a leopard.  The gorilla finds the baby human, and takes him back to the family to raise him.  The boy, of course, is Tarzan.  As he grows up, he has problems fitting in - the other youngsters don't accept him, and neither does the head of the family, Kerchak.  Eventually, he learns that he's human, when he meets Jane and her father and their guide, Clayton. Then, he struggles to decide whether he belongs with his family or with the humans that are clearly more like him.Up until this point, the story is nothing short of charming.  Then, Disney adds a gratuitous bad-guy (Clayton, of course, and anyone will see it coming) which completely ruins everything.  Tarzan rushes headlong into the fight which proves what?  He's brave?  He cares about his family?  We knew that already.  There was a point in the movie, right before the bad-guy part of the plot comes in, where I was actually interested.  After that, I just wasn't interested anymore.  Plot 4 \/ 10.Oh yeah, one note I wanted to add - this movie should have been rated PG. Three scenes of note (that justify this comment) - at least twice in the movie, we see blood, once, we see the moment of death, not directly but directly enough that I would consider it violence.  Also, Tarzan touches Jane's breasts at one point - in an innocent way, but still.Of course, this is Disney and They Wouldn't Dare Give It A PG Rating.Overall - I enjoyed the movie, but because the thing they did with the plot was so annoying, I'm not going to be seeing it again.

It delivers complete purpose to every critical aspect and generates a healthy measure of muscle with equally proportioned pathos.'The Maltese Falcon' moves at a scorching pace and this break-neck speed is derived from the snappy dialogue. As Sam Spade confronts Cairo (Peter Lorre) and delivers the line, When you're slapped, you'll take it and like it, one can only sit in delightful anticipation of what will come next.Everything about this film is riveting as individual scenes begin to accumulate and form the basis of a structure that is both unique and highly entertaining.

As the final credits appeared, I found myself wanting more - I wanted more charismatic villains, I wanted more heroes in the true tough-guy fashion, I wanted more deception, more posturing and more rugged suavity.'The Maltese Falcon' is all about delivering style with lashings of intelligent story-telling. Fifty three years after its first release, this movie is still going strong with elements that can still captivate constituents of generation X. For me, this only confirms what a splendid film this really is - because that is the true test of quality. And how does it hold up after repeated viewing? Even after the sacrilegious act of colorization, very well thank you.

It's mood, humor and rich texture providing the inspiration for many copies - some skillful, others just blatant and second-rate imitations.'The Maltese Falcon' is taken from the Dashiell Hammett novel of the same name and is faithfully reproduced by writer and debut director, John Huston. It is however, a superior remake of the 1931 film of the same name. Hollywood has a fine history of producing shoddy remakes but in this case, the original is far from the best.There are many ingredients that make this film the timeless classic it is - Humphrey Bogart's discerning portrayal of Sam Spade, Mary Astor's sexy rendering of Ruth Wonderly, a support cast that includes perennial favorites Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre, but for me it was the brilliant black and white photography. It delivers complete purpose to every critical aspect and generates a healthy measure of muscle with equally proportioned pathos.'The Maltese Falcon' moves at a scorching pace and this break-neck speed is derived from the snappy dialogue.

I have been overjoyed at the stunning developments over the years since the days I sat in a darkened old Packard in a drive-in and watched the new releases of Forbidden Planet and 20 Million Miles to Earth. What is accomplished today is simply stunning by comparison, truly visually brilliant. Too bad better stories couldn't be written.Yes, I was disappointed. A Saturday with an Asimov novel would have been better spent. Still, there was entertainment value here, just don't expect high-art, especially if you are not a sci-fi fan. In fact, if you are not a sci-fi fan you doubtless would feel cheated.As a die hard fan of the genre, I could find things worth watching. Ewan McGregor can be much better than he was allowed here, just as was Neeson and the others. Still, Mr. McGregor could be really good in sequels if better stories were fleshed out. He is very entertaining to watch in other films. A real waste of talent here with these two. Liam may be better off for having been killed off.Natalie Portman is very talented and turning into a lovely young woman, but I hated her in the terribly hideous Queen's garb. She looked more comfortable, and more convincing in the simpler dress she wore on the dusty planet following Ewan and Liam (BTW, can't these people visualize more planets that do not look like the African desert, or better yet, something really original.). The sets and effects created for her home planet were the only ones worth watching of landscapes. And just what is the idea of using an obviously juvenile actress to play the Queen, kiddie appeal? Nothing against Natalie, but I think a more mature actress would have been much better for the story.At first I thought, what could Mr. Lucas have been thinking when he created the Jar Jar Binks character? Then I realized he must have been setting us up for the sequel. Everyone hates this dweeb so much now that great emotion can be generated with a turn around in character or at least a particularly grisly demise. That is right George, isn't it?Film makers have to plow a new field to find ground fertile enough to make me dislike a sci-fi flick, but here they almost succeeded. The fact that I can away convinced that I could make a film ten times better with an antique script didn't help, either. As for the rest, I hope it fades away quickly as I'm about to gag on the merchandising, which isn't deserved, BTW.The bottom line If you love anything resembling sci-fi, this film will at least entertain. If you aren't a real die hard fan, look for a bargain basement theater with sharp discounts. It's still worth the big screen for the effects.
