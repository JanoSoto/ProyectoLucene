While there, he meets his two brothers, Virgil and Morgan along with his good friend Doc Holliday; and all is fine and dandy. That is, until an infamous band of outlaws calling themselves 'The Cowboys' turns up to spoil Wyatt's party. These are the outlaws that Wyatt loved to dispatch in his prime, but now all he wants is to retire and have done with it...will he be able to do that, or is it time for him to re-enter the frey?Kurt Russell takes the lead role of Wyatt Earp for this movie, and does a good job with it (despite a very silly mustache). When justifying his reasons for casting Russell in Escape From New York, John Carpenter said that he could play anybody; and I think he can...but he's a lot better at roles that require him to show off, and he doesn't really get that chance here. Still, it's different and refreshing to see him in a more serious role. Russell gets support from a number of good actors, one of which being one of my personal favourites, Bill Paxton. Like Kurt, Paxton isn't given reign to play to his strengths here either. Paxton is at his best when he's running the show like he was in Aliens and Near Dark (despite them also being supporting roles), but his character here is a more subdued one, so he doesn't shine as much as he had previously. Val Kilmer is the only cast member that is allowed to go over the top in his role. He plays Doc Holliday; the drunken, loud mouthed braggart of the film and spends most it making quips and generally showing off. Although this does the film credit as it makes it more exciting, it does become annoying after a while. These are the stars that stick out the most, but also getting in on the fun to complete an excellent cast are Sam Elliot, Paxton's Aliens co-star; Michael Beihn, and Powers Boothe, the man he would later cast in the excellent 'Frailty'. Then there's Billy Bob Thornton, Charlton Heston, Michael Rooker and we've even got Robert Mitchum doing the narrating!The film is very dramatic; a lot of the cast look like they could auditioning for the next Oscar ceremony, and the music adds to the theatrics, coming in whenever there's a whisper of a heartbreaking or exciting moment (the latter of which the film has plenty). However, this over-dramatization adds to the campy feel of the film and it makes it quite fun to watch. Tombstone is a very good movie; it's well shot, the acting is good enough and it remains entertaining for it's duration, and it's certainly one of the better westerns that have been released since 'Unforgiven' was met with critical acclaim in 1992.

I have usually been OK with every Bluth movie so a relaxed. But the first thing you notice is that it is typical Bluth characters against atypical backgrounds graphically. They are overwhelming. I didn't expect this. It goes pretty quick at the beginning. In fact, the beginning is so eye catching you may be afraid to leave for fear of missing some other jaw-dropping graphic.The visuals are quite striking in many instances. That alone is probably worth 2 or 3 viewings. Multiple formats are used and at times are effectively used in tandem. You may not even get it all in 2 viewings. I'm not sure I did. Enough about graphics. It's simple. If you like visual effects you will like this. As noted, the characters are fairly typical Bluth stock. But the one thing that bothered me the most is that none of the characters are really warm. The main male character is pretty much a jerk through a good chunk of the movie so it is difficult to sympathize. Without giving away details - The Captain is the most likable at first, but he isn't the main character. Plus he does a few flip-flops in character that don't make sense. The female lead is handled well and seems the most normal, but she isn't the one you want to follow. She isn't the story. The side characters, mostly alien fabrications, had the potential to be - well, more lovable and memorable. They just don't set well. In fact, some are just downright silly. It is my feeling that because this seems to be a rather serious attempt at a good science-fiction story the typical Bluth character formula makes it seems to confuse the viewer a bit.The enemy aliens and their concept was most interesting. I enjoy when someone comes up with an alien concept that seems possible and isn't based on Earth biology. Unfortunately it is never quite explained why they hate humans. Instead all I recall is a vague comment about the future of mankind which, for a science fiction movie, is dreadfully ambiguous. Nevertheless the concept was interesting. Did I mention that the enemy aliens, Drej, are also a visual treat?The story seems to be based on a number of prior sci-fi films. I can live with that. But there are raging holes in the logic. Once you get past the visuals the story has areas that just don't make sense. The logic of purpose for a number of things doesn't add up. I am left asking questions at the end. Maybe it's just me.In fact, it is toward the end that there is a certain graphic sequence that doesn't work. I thought it was embarrassingly amateurish compared to the rest of the movie.Bottomline I give it a seven.

Did I mention that the enemy aliens, Drej, are also a visual treat?The story seems to be based on a number of prior sci-fi films. I can live with that. But there are raging holes in the logic. Once you get past the visuals the story has areas that just don't make sense. The logic of purpose for a number of things doesn't add up. I am left asking questions at the end. Maybe it's just me.In fact, it is toward the end that there is a certain graphic sequence that doesn't work. I thought it was embarrassingly amateurish compared to the rest of the movie.Bottomline I give it a seven. It is definitely worth a few viewings if only in admiration for the work put into the graphics. It's great.

Aside from this, I must really take issue with all the creative liberties they took with this. It just didn't do the game any justice at all.

They convince the most unpopular kid in college Duncan (Gedde Watanabe) to lend them a car, Duncan's only condition is that they take him with them and pretend to be his friends. They head into Los Angeles to find a strip club. Looking through a local paper they decide on the After Dark Club. Once past the cockroach eating doorman Vic (Sandy Baron) Keith and Duncan grab ringside seats and watch the show while AJ tries to find a suitable stripper for the party. Katrina (Grace Jones) takes to the stage and performs a dance which leaves everyone in the club spellbound. AJ goes backstage to try and get her to perform at the party. Back in the club Keith is being hassled by an attractive waitress, Alison (Dedee Pfeiffer) who says she recognizes him, at one point Duncan comes out with a great line he says you don't have any friends who want to remember me do you? Nah, I didn't think so. Later on in the night he also asks a different waitress what time do you get off? she replies 2.30 Duncan then says can I watch!? When AJ doesn't reappear from backstage Keith becomes suspicious and starts asking questions. As the night draws on Keith realizes this is no ordinary strip club and as his night continues to go from bad to worse will he live to see the morning and save his friends? Written and directed by Richard Wenk I liked this and thought it was good fun. The way Wenk films the night scenes is highly stylized, he uses a pink and green neon lighting effect. For instance there is a scene when Keith is walking in an abandoned sewer system, as he walks down a tunnel one side of it is bathed completely in pink and the other side in green, almost all of the exterior night shots are lit this way, it looks quite cool if a little unusual. The special make up effects by Greg Cannom are for the most part impressive, we get a ripped out heart, bitten necks, slit wrists, death by high heeled shoe, a melting face and decaying vampires. Surprisingly, considering it's set in a strip club there isn't a lot of nudity, hardly any in fact. The acting was fine even if Chris Makepeace makes for a slightly dull leading man on occasions, Dedee Pfeiffer makes for a very sexy heroine, and best of all Grace Jones didn't say a single word throughout the entire film which is just the way it should be. The script is a little slow to get going, it takes over half an hour for the horror elements to kick in, but when it does it's great fun. Although Duncan as the comedy relief didn't always work and became annoying on occasions, and why when their running around in Los Angeles is there no one else anywhere? Not one single person, or car. Overall I liked it, you could certainly do a lot worse. Recommended for some fun.

A computer capable of handing the intense mathematical calculations CGI entailed often took up an entire room. Video games were strictly two-dimensional, and often consisted of video displays that a legally blind man could make out the individual pixels in.

It was managed by a Jewish man, Itzchak Stern, and populated hundreds of working Jews. One day, the workers and the living Jews in the ghetto were overruled by invading Nazis, led by Amon Goeth. They were evacuated and taken to a concentration camp near the ghetto. Devastated by the loss of workers, Schindler demanded to Goeth that his workers be released immediately. But not so; Goeth told Schindler that the Jews were to remain in the camp. Determined, and self-willed, Schindler opened a business near the camp, and made a list of Jews that could work there. The list was only meant for a couple hundreds, but eventually became a list with one thousand and eleven Jew names on it. The Jews were shipped out, and worked until the end of the war. Afterwards, at midnight the day World War II was strictly declared over, Stern and some friends made a letter of evidence that Schindler was innocent, and a ring out of a Jew's tooth, with the words Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire inscribed on the side. It was at exact moment that Schindler learned that not only did his factory become successful, it saved the lives of Jewish victims. This is a beautiful yet horrifying crafted movie about the terrible Holocaust. It is a very well-done picture, with fantastic cinematography-all done in black and white-, flawless acting, and a powerful score. Liam Neeson plays Oskar Schindler, showing the kindness yet fierceness of the man who was considered a 'savior.' Ben Kingsley is wonderful as the Jewish assistant, Itzchak Stern. But the most recognizable performance of the cast is Ralph Fiennes, who is incredible as the root of all evil, Amon Goeth.The story is incredible all in itself, and it contains such mind-blowing images, text, and sounds. Spielberg used his directing skills very well, showing audiences the real horrors and incredible sadness through these elements. Such complex things are heart-wrenching to imagine, but not even this film can display the Holocaust. This film shows only but a pinprick of the evils of this senseless massacre. Notable scenes are the liquidation of the Ghetto, the children escape, and, most of all, the heartbreaking close-to-the-end scene. The final scene is emotional, because you see the 'Schindler Jews', along with the actors that played them, place rocks on the grave of Schindler. And the last person, whom is only but a shadow to us, places a red rose in the middle.I cannot tell you the incredible and durable sadness I felt as I watched this film, but it made me realize that even ordinary people can save lives. I recommend that everyone should see this; it really is more than a regular film. It is a masterpiece.

I always thought of it as a classic but I watched it again recently and found it disappointing. I think what bothers me is, first, that the film charts the very beginning of Montana's ascent through the ranks and his demise. His period of 'success' is played out in montage in a way that seems very cheesy and dated. My second objection concerns the character himself. Pacino's acting is fine but the character he plays is thoroughly unlikeable and hard to sympathies with. In other mob films such as Goodfellas, Casino, Carlito's Way and the Godfather the principal protagonist is also a gangster whose unravelling is self-inflicted. Take for example Carlito's Way. Carlito is killed as the result of a problem he caused, not anyone else which brings out the pathos of his situation so poignantly. In Scarface, by contrast, the protagonist is violent, angry and petty with no discernible traces of humanity. Even his relations with his family are nasty. The point is that I found it impossible to feel anything with Montana. The successful mob films challenge us by showing us real characters whose choices are motivated by love, loyalty, family etc. but who end up going down a path of violent excess from which it is difficult or impossible to escape. Thus, we meet characters that seem redeemable and so we are engaged and interested in their fate. Scarface simply tells the story of a thug who is a thug not because of circumstances but because he wants to be. As such, Montana's story is not one of tragic inevitability but just inevitability.

I always thought of it as a classic but I watched it again recently and found it disappointing. I think what bothers me is, first, that the film charts the very beginning of Montana's ascent through the ranks and his demise. His period of 'success' is played out in montage in a way that seems very cheesy and dated. My second objection concerns the character himself. Pacino's acting is fine but the character he plays is thoroughly unlikeable and hard to sympathies with. In other mob films such as Goodfellas, Casino, Carlito's Way and the Godfather the principal protagonist is also a gangster whose unravelling is self-inflicted. Take for example Carlito's Way. Carlito is killed as the result of a problem he caused, not anyone else which brings out the pathos of his situation so poignantly.

With Campbell, Sutherland and Ritter being some of my favourite actors, i knew i would enjoy it to a certain extent. The plot sees Macy, hit-man, son of hit-man go through a typical mid life crisis-he loves his wife but wants a change, seeing his life as being repetitive, and wants out of the killing business. Going to a shrink, he finds Campbell, feisty, young, refreshing, and falls for her. Then, of course, he finds his next hit is to be his shrink.The acting is well above average from all concerned, even the kid who went on to be extremely annoying in the very poor The Ring, the plot will keep you involved, and the honesty and lack of stupid jokes is refreshing for a Hollywood movie. Sutherland's pressing father gives added depth, his relationship with his Grandson particularly interesting. It is the women however we feel sympathetic for, with both mens' wives being rejected as less important than their own personal interests, and Campbell is just being used as an escape for Macy. 7 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"26 November 2004","score":"","review":" POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!I'd heard this was very good, and as it is still unavailable in the UK, i bought a Region 1 copy, hoping it would be as good as everyone said.

He was reportedely unhappy with the final product, despite its box-office success. Now, it's a good picture for them Paramount, he said upon its release, but it's not the picture I made... now the characters in the film are black-and-white, not gray-and-human as I planned them.Hand it to Brando to be dissatisfied with a film because he didn't manage to make it as long as he wanted to. Regardless of what Brando thought, this is a really fine Western and a unique one, too - it seems fresh and new, like a Cool Man's West or something. Having Brando (when he was still looking fairly trim) in the lead role certainly gives it a certain glamor and the story itself - and execution - is great.Overall I wish Brando had made another film after this but to the best of my knowledge this is really the only true film he ever made. If he was just trying to prove he could direct, he did - even if the film has its flaws, it's far from bad.
