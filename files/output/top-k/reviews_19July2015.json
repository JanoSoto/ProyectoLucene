Seven Samurai is a good example of a film that is slow, but in that film the viewer is rewarded for their patience by a spectacular closing act. No such luck here. The first 90 minutes revolve around spaceships flying around we then have Dreyfuss and his family squabbling and arguing - all this isn't helped by the fact that none of them have a shred of likability about them. As the mother, Teri Garr was particularly grating and her overacting became mildly irritating. Likewise, the kids were annoying as well and the family melodrama that we witness for the majority of the running time gave me a mild headache.I think the worst thing about this film is that Spielberg somehow manages to make this family unfriendly; younger viewers will be more forgiving than an adult audience and won't look for things such as poor character development, plot holes etc. Kids will just want the film to be fun and exciting and the problem here is that Close Encounters is neither. I can imagine kids saying 'Mummy, Daddy, when's this going to get going?' 'When is something going to happen?'

Most of the intentional humour of this movie falls flat and the sentimental stuff is even worse, but if that sort of thing annoys you you're in the wrong state of mind to watch Jingle All The Way. This movie is worth your while for moments like when muscle-bound Arnold is somehow intimidated by Jim Belushi and an army of winos in Santa costumes. Or for the fantastic climax where the kid doesn't realise he's talking to his dad until Arnold (or Howard, if you're in a generous mood) takes off his mask. The mask covered roughly 2% of his face and he'd been talking with a thick Austrian accent for minutes straight, so that big reveal just broke me. One thing I did wonder throughout this movie what if the main roles were reserved, with Sinbad as the average father and Schwarzenegger as the crazed antagonist? Seemed like that would have been a more interesting casting choice, but this one works almost as well.

Please, OK, have mercy, we are eating out here stick to your bad haircut and go bust a seem on your jeans dorky boy. Yes, Wren the expert on theology and how it applies to bad dancing.

Action movies depend on the strength of their villains, trust me, you will really hate this guy. Bridget Fonda really surprised me in this move; it was a very unflattering role, and she does very well in it. This is important for the bulk of the movie is her rescue with her little girl and she really makes the viewer feel sorry for her enslavement to French Boy and his assistant Buzz Cut. The fight scenes are the best of any of Li's movies. The one that starts in a laundry chute and ends up with Li using anything handy in the laundry room, irons, washing machine and dryers. His speed is incredible; like Bruce Lee, you cannot see the man's lightning snap blows land. They are a blur of speed. The movie's pacing is the real star; some of his other films, like Fearless, have slow parts in them. Once this starts, it is non stop action and intensity until the end.The title refers to acupuncture which Li is also trained to use. The villain is killed at the end with a needle that makes all the blood go up to the head and not come down again. French Boy does a good job selling it. The best fight is between these two brothers, one big and one small, with white Bart Simpson haircuts. The action is one of his best fights ever. Li hides out in a Asian Chip shop with a sweet old guy that he inadvertently gets killed. The rapport between the two adds some needed levity. Fonda also lightens it a little but it is a very dark, serious movie. The cruelty visited on the prostitutes enslaved to French Boy and Buzz Cut is quite realistic. I have always been a big fan of Jet Li but all the rest of you out there know what the giant flaw in all his movies is The Music. Li thinks we all listen to rap and puts non stop loud rap crap in all of his films. I understood it in Romeo Must Die because it took place in an African American setting. Inexplicably, he puts it in all of his movies except Fearless. It is very loud and very awful; if I were you, I would turn the volume down when he fights the Bart Simpson twins. Jet Li's best movie.

A weird experience for me since I'm a big fan of the previous films and I found myself scratching my head thinking why someone thought that humor could be used in serious topics such as brutal attacks against elderly and women in abandoned neighborhoods. Or worst since when Paul Kersey (Charles Bronson), the vigilante who lost his family in the previous films of the franchise could have some humor inside him. Kersey worked better as his most bittered and bloody-thirst while doing justice with his own hands.Golan-Globus surely ruined the franchise (the second Death Wish is way over-the-top but still in the dark mood it becomes something good to watch). This instance has a poor neighborhood composed of Jewish elderly, Latin and blacks terrorized by marginal types who enter their homes, use of violence and sexual assaults to get money which they call paying for protection. One of the groups' victims is Paul's friend from their Korea War days and the moment he gets there, Kersey is arrested accused of the crime. Lame but understandable. Let's move ahead. While on detention, the former architect turned vigilant is offered a nice proposition by the police chief (Ed Lauter, simply awesome) who knows about Kersey's past killing muggers and rapists Kersey is given the chance to clean the streets and remove the bad guys from view. Obviously this chief is being pressured by the mayor and others about the high levels of criminality, but Kersey can be of help. Unorthodox but acceptable in terms of films. The problem comes when the movie decides to present a bad guy. Kersey always fought groups of thugs, never masterminds or nemesis of some sort. Here, the bad guy is Fraker (Gavan O'Herlihy) who practically controls the city and even share a jail cell with Kersey and they talk as if they were old buddies from other movie (not really). But of course, it's not only Paul versus Fraker; it's Paul against Fraker's gang members who literally outnumber the old folks who live there and who also will try to help Paul. Here comes another stupidity all the old residents possessed guns but somehow they never used against used them against the invaders (only Paul's friend tried to but end up killed), and an old couple almost got arrested because they owned a gun. The police took their gun - even with the man having a permit - but they cannot see all the robberies, the rapes and the deaths around the building. That's just ridiculous. Death Wish 3 is manageable even with all those problems I mentioned, and besides when Kersey goes in action that movies gets where it needs, proving to be exciting, tense and creating nice scenarios, even though the humor seems completely out of place - except when our hero shoots a mugger and the whole crowd begins to cheer. It's all fine until the movie provides a female companion to Kersey, a prosecutor who wants him to press charges against the police for his outrageous detention. Their affair escalates very quickly and for no good reason. She sees him and she likes him immediately. If only life was like that. I could accept that. But when her character gets killed by the group I could connect with the film anymore. Kept watching but wasn't in it anymore. The amount of absurdity, goofiness and unexplained things was too troubling for me to handle. It's fun to watch but it doesn't have any iota of what is trying to be, or trying to do. And have in mind, this was the first Death Wish to be released after the Bernhard Goetz incident on the subway in 1984, and you have Charles Bronson advising people to not imitate the film, don't become a vigilante BUT the whole movie goes the other way, killing bad guys is fun, get your neighbors, grab your guns and start to kill. Some may wonder but wasn't the original Death Wish about the same thing I just pointed out but without the laughs? No, not at all. Michael Winner's earlier film was a loud cry of the society against criminality and police inefficiency, deeply surrounded by lousy politics not doing their job, and as was current with the 1970's cinema movement many characters simply went mad as hell and couldn't take it anymore. Time to set standards and do justice. And Kersey was very conflicted before turning into a justice warrior instead of the guy filled with Schwarzenegger's like punchlines whenever the writer thinks he ought to do those (After killing two guys robbers stealing his car, he's asked asked what happened and he says he was just giving those guys a message). Disappointing and very low, Death Wish 3 can only be enjoyed for its brainless moments if you are looking exactly for that. Those who seek to find more of the same from the previous films will be dead on the water. We all need laughs but it only works without falling into ridicule if the topics brought on are meant to be funny.

But this is not one of them. The story is very stupid and you can easily tell this film was a cash grab and a sad excuse for a sequel. After the enormous success of Jurassic Park, both the book and movie, Michael Crichton was asked to write a sequel novel to Jurassic Park. He agreed to do so and had to write the sequel based around who they could get back for the second movie. They were able to get Jeff Goldblum back, so Ian Malcolm was made the main character. His character died in the first book so he had to make up a reason for him to be back for the second one. In the movie, like I said Jeff Goldblum (Ian Malcolm) is the main character, which would be a cool thing to see if he gave the same type of performance like he gave in Jurassic Park. But in this he phones it in, which sucks because when Jeff Goldblum is good in a movie, it adds a kind of vibrancy to the film, ex. Jurassic Park, The Grand Budapest Hotel. Even although he doesn't really try in this movie, he is still there nonetheless. Of all the performances in the movie I think Vince Vaughn was the best, who seemed excited to be in a big blockbuster after only doing smaller films before like Swingers. The CGI in this looks very good if not better than the first Jurassic Park, and the dinosaurs look very convincing. The film is well made on a technical level but a lot of the shots are bland and nothing extraordinary like in a regular Spielberg movie. His direction is flat and it kinda feels like one of his movies but at the same time it doesn't. I was very bored during this movie, it was nowhere near as fun as Jurassic Park. The theme in this movie is used rarely and they use it just to remind you that you're watching the sequel to Jurassic Park. An example of this was when Ian Malcolm is leaving Hammond's house they use the main theme while Dr. Hammond is walking back to his bed. I was expecting it to cut to some dinosaurs but nope, it's just him walking. So majestic. I'm just getting goosebumps thinking about it, screw that shot in the first one with the stegosaurus eating the tree. This blows that shot out of the park. Overall I would not recommend this movie, as it is very forgettable and not fun.

I'm just getting goosebumps thinking about it, screw that shot in the first one with the stegosaurus eating the tree. This blows that shot out of the park.

We've had a better Joker, we've had a better Batman, and we've had better action, and a better story, so this movie is sort of eclipsed by the Nolan movies. Still though, this is a good movie. Michael Keaton, though criminally underused, is a great Batman. He's got a lot less screen presence than you'd expect, he's sort of quiet and subtle. Bruce never really jumps out at you, but when you think about his character, you realize how great he is. Joker on the other hand, chews up nearly all the screen time, and Nicholson delivers a very funny, and very memorable Joker. I do like him a lot, I just wish Keaton got to do a bit more. Kim Basinger plays reporter Vicki Vale, Bruce Wayne's love interest for this film. She's actually one of the better love interests in superhero films, because she actually gets a character defined apart from Bruce Wayne, and is more memorable than a lot of the other girlfriends in comic book movies, even though she only had one film. Now let's talk about the action a little. As I said before, we have better Batman action now, but I'd still like to give this action a big thumbs up, because it brings some much needed realism to Batman. The only downside is that the way it's choreographed or whatever, is really slow. In some action scenes, people just stand there while Batman whips out gadgets. It's still good action, it's just that now the action scenes have become a bit more refined and flashy, making these just look a little bland. Now, one thing that isn't too great, is that there's never the classic Joker pushes Batman to his limits, tempting him to kill. No, Batman's okay with killing. He doesn't try to do it, but if it happens, then, no big deal. I don't mind a different take, and while I do think this version is interesting, I just think that they lost a really good dynamic. The story also is pretty...chaotic. I know that's how Joker's supposed to be, but falling in love with Vicki Vale because of her picture? Seriously? I do like Joker killing Bruce's parents, and I like his Joker toxin or whatever he uses on people that he keeps trying to distribute, and I like the pseudo mystery around Bruce's past and Batman's identity, even though everybody already knew the secret to both.

Unlike the many horror and genre directors - Tobe Hooper, Ridley Scott, George Romero, Terry Gilliam, and of course John Carpenter - who all profess their love for the film and the influence it had on them as filmmakers, I came to this after seeing Carpenter's 1982 remake\/re-telling of John W. Campbell's story 'Who Goes There?' I didn't come in to it with low expectations or anything like that, but one has to weigh the It's a Classic comments with the context of the time there hadn't been many, if much at all, in the way of alien-invades-and-terrifies flicks; that same year Wise made The Day the Earth Stood Still, which took a different tact on how to look at the Men Coming to Earth scenario. For Howard Hawks and writer Charles Lederer, they wanted something that was about something elemental and simple a bunch of men banding together (with one of the tough Hawks gals on the side as the Captain's love interest) taking steps to fight against the 'Thing'.But my question was, in other words, had it aged well? Yes and no. Yes in this sense this film is really good at showing characters talking to and listening to one another. Of course it being Hawks, and it's his baby even if he's not fully credited as director (but if Christian Nyby directed this, so did Tobe Hooper on Poltergeist, but I digress). Over-lapping dialog, a little smirking humor and camaraderie in the face of a danger just outside the door (think Rio Bravo years later, or even Only Angels Have Wings), and the fact that the first half of this film is really just getting to know these characters.The over-lapping dialog isn't just some stylistic quirk, though Hawks surely used it more often in his comedies (His Girl Friday at probably the most rapid-fire rate of any of them, to the point of a kind of machine-gun poetry or something). In the case of The Thing, it heightens the realism, and Lederer's script (with assist from Ben Hecht and, no kidding if the trivia's right, William Faulkner) makes these characters' concerns pretty real and interesting. The Captain Hendry is just out to make sure his crew is safe, his orders go through, and when s*** starts to hit the fan that he has everyone in check and everyone knows what they're doing; on the flip-side the scientist Dr. Carrington is more about, well, the science, trying to study whatever this 'thing' is underneath the ice, that it's something humanity should preserve, regardless of the danger. And the banter between Henry and the gal, Nikki, helps add maybe not levity but just a sense that these two know each other well, get along, and there's a richness to their relationship that heads off the plot around them.If there is something that hasn't particularly aged well it's in the last act where the scientist gets into that state of mind we've now seen so many times, especially if one's seen just a handful of science fiction films, where Dr. Carrington gets into a frenzy about not killing the Thing. His questioning about being so hasty may be fine, at first, but it really gets over the top in the final reel. The other problem with the film may be more obvious but, simply, the Thing itself isn't that scary. The most surprising or just suspenseful part comes with the Thing is set on fire; how quickly this escalates, and the realism (yes, realism, no CGI folks) of a guy getting set on fire, is rather extraordinary - it was the one moment of the film where I felt any sort of tension, mostly as I suddenly became anxious as to what would happen to the human characters in the room.But it's easy to make jokes about James Arness and how he is, in fact, a Carrot-Man of an alien (his head is more Frankenstein-monster-shaped, but the connections the scientist character makes to plant-life and vegetation makes this clearer. But if the thing that Carpenter certainly improved on was the horror and the special effects and suspense, I actually wonder if he totally improved on the character dynamics. Again, it's still a B movie, and I'm sure Hawks knows it. Yet he has capable actors, with Tobey, Spencer as Scotty, and Cornthwaite and Carrington (maybe the moment I liked best is when he appeared genuinely tired, a man of science who needs some sleep), and there's real LOGIC to the characters' actions. One of the things that I liked so much was that people actually talked intelligently, with reason and in trying to find the best solution to something, every step of the way. You don't get that really with too many sci-fi or horror today, so that's very refreshing.An all-time classic? I don't know. But The Thing From Another World - which coined the phrase 'Watch the Skies' as if (or maybe just as) a parable to nuclear attacks or attacks in the age of the Soviet scares (though it's not really made a parallel in any specific way, the feeling is sort of general) - is solid craftsmanship and gives its actors plenty to say and do that isn't simply boring filler or ponderous exposition. Characters are constantly thinking and trying to reason; even the scientist, who may be the closest to an 'antagonist' here, has his points and makes them clearly before becoming a cliché, and Hawks' control of a setting and mood, of making it about the mounting pressure and keeping cool under it, is a pleasure to behold. 8.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"19 July 2015","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I wasn't sure if I expected to like The Thing From Another World or not.

And the banter between Henry and the gal, Nikki, helps add maybe not levity but just a sense that these two know each other well, get along, and there's a richness to their relationship that heads off the plot around them.If there is something that hasn't particularly aged well it's in the last act where the scientist gets into that state of mind we've now seen so many times, especially if one's seen just a handful of science fiction films, where Dr. Carrington gets into a frenzy about not killing the Thing. His questioning about being so hasty may be fine, at first, but it really gets over the top in the final reel. The other problem with the film may be more obvious but, simply, the Thing itself isn't that scary. The most surprising or just suspenseful part comes with the Thing is set on fire; how quickly this escalates, and the realism (yes, realism, no CGI folks) of a guy getting set on fire, is rather extraordinary - it was the one moment of the film where I felt any sort of tension, mostly as I suddenly became anxious as to what would happen to the human characters in the room.But it's easy to make jokes about James Arness and how he is, in fact, a Carrot-Man of an alien (his head is more Frankenstein-monster-shaped, but the connections the scientist character makes to plant-life and vegetation makes this clearer. But if the thing that Carpenter certainly improved on was the horror and the special effects and suspense, I actually wonder if he totally improved on the character dynamics. Again, it's still a B movie, and I'm sure Hawks knows it. Yet he has capable actors, with Tobey, Spencer as Scotty, and Cornthwaite and Carrington (maybe the moment I liked best is when he appeared genuinely tired, a man of science who needs some sleep), and there's real LOGIC to the characters' actions. One of the things that I liked so much was that people actually talked intelligently, with reason and in trying to find the best solution to something, every step of the way. You don't get that really with too many sci-fi or horror today, so that's very refreshing.An all-time classic? I don't know. But The Thing From Another World - which coined the phrase 'Watch the Skies' as if (or maybe just as) a parable to nuclear attacks or attacks in the age of the Soviet scares (though it's not really made a parallel in any specific way, the feeling is sort of general) - is solid craftsmanship and gives its actors plenty to say and do that isn't simply boring filler or ponderous exposition. Characters are constantly thinking and trying to reason; even the scientist, who may be the closest to an 'antagonist' here, has his points and makes them clearly before becoming a cliché, and Hawks' control of a setting and mood, of making it about the mounting pressure and keeping cool under it, is a pleasure to behold. 8.5\/10 ","genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"19 July 2015","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Sleeping Beauty is one of the more uneven Disney classics.

But this movie is terrible. I'm talking about a movie that is filled with ps2 graphics, a forced romance subplot, cringe-worthy acting, bland characters, and a director that is so incompetent that he makes Michael Bay look Alfred Hitchcock. Attack of the Clones, in my personal opinion, is the weakest entry in the Star Wars saga. The entire movie is just boring talk scene after boring talk scene, and over half of those scenes consist of Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christianson) and Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman) trying to build a relationship. By the way, Hayden and Natalie's chemistry is like Tatooine. It's dry. You can just tell that they get uncomfortable just by looking at each other. The characters in this movie suck, too. Almost everyone is an unlikable idiot. Anakin is a whiny, angst - ridden man-child with a passion for stalking Padme, his love interest. Padme is a one-dimensional character with the personality of sandpaper, and likes to remind the audience that she's a SENATOR. Wow. A senator! Politics! Yes, that is what I want in a Star Wars movie! POLITICS! Young Boba Fett (Daniel Logan) somehow manages to be more annoying than young Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd). In fact, Daniel had never even seen a Star Wars movie before he was casted as Boba Fett. Way to go, George Lucas. And then there's Jar Jar Binks. He returns in this awful sequel because, you know, everyone TOTALLY wanted Jar Jar in the sequel to Phantom Menace. He was such a cool character! We couldn't LIVE without Jar Jar! Just kidding, everyone hates this unfunny, annoying moron. Thankfully, he has nowhere NEAR the amount of screen time in Phantom Menace. But he's still annoying during the scenes he is in. Do I really need to go on? Almost every character in this film is horrible. However, there are a few good things this film has to offer. The Battle on Geinosis is action-packed and adrenaline-pumping, the air speeder chase on Corusant is entertaining, the fight between Obi-Wan and Jango Fett is something I always enjoy viewing, and the closing light saber duel between Anakin, Obi Wan, Yoda, and Count Dooku is pretty good. Speaking of Count Dooku, he's probably one of the best characters in the movie. Portrayed by Christopher Lee, Dooku reminds me of a James Bond villain. He's coldly polite and cunning, calm, and collected, but he's also very powerful with the dark side of the force, and is skilled with a light saber. When he fights Obi- Wan and Anakin, you can just tell that Dooku knows that he's in control of the battle, as evidenced by his evil smirk he has during the duel. Lucas gave Lee a script that's the equivalent to Internet fan-fiction, but Lee did a pretty good job with it. Ewan McGregor is still a convincing Obi-Wan during his prime, and can act to any awful script Lucas gives him. Ian Mcdarmind also does a good job, too. He makes the Chancellor someone you could trust. Any suspicions you had about him would be forgotten. He's like the devil; you're certain that he has evil intentions, but he so manipulative that you feel like you have to trust him. Finally, Attack of the Clones has an amazing soundtrack. John Williams has once again crafted an amazing score that you won't be forgetting anytime soon. Unfortunately, the cons of this movie outweigh the pros.

Although the movie is about the news, it's very concept can apply to all forms of mass media. Wag the Dog is a political satire. It's whole point is to show how manipulative media is and how gullible the public is. Barry Levinson has a knack for making feel-good movies, so there's nothing too outrageous. The movie is about the President of the US who has sexual misconduct with an underage girl and breaks into the public two weeks before election. We never do see or hear him. Excellent move by Barry Levinson. De Niro plays a spin doctor who is determined to make the President look like a hero by creating a fictitious war with Albania. Why Albania? Albania is a very tiny country who many people have not heard of. De Niro gets a Hollywood producer (Hoffman) to help create the war by using fake stories and fake footage. The public buys it all. While watching this, keep in mind that the movie is a satire. Kirsten Dunst is an actress who plays an Albanian victim in a battleground in the phony newsreel.

How he comes to know both of these women was a little too quick for me and their relationships change too quickly. The film did not portray exactly what was going on in the main guy's head. However apart from that the film is great. Using music from Simon and Garfunkel which fits the film almost perfectly, the film portrays the main character in a strange light which is unusual but refreshing. The characters are played very well, especially Dustin Hoffman as the main character. This brings magic to the film.
