One might think it would seem repetitious seeing the same events three times but than doesn't really happen as the slight differences in timing mean we learn different things about the characters each time.The reason the story is shown three times is never really explained, it is up to the viewer to decide if we are merely being shown how a trivial change in ones life can lead to drastic changes later on or if Lola is in fact being given a chance to live those crucial twenty minutes over again.The acting is good throughout, especially Franka Potente as Lola, she made it seem like she had been running almost non-stop for twenty minutes at the end of each story, I felt tired just watching her run so much. The techno music also added to the sense of pace in the film so worked very well even though it isn't the type of music I'd choose to listen to.

Psycho feels like one of those, both in its story and its construction (though Psycho is about 10 times longer than most of the shorts you'd find on the internet). That's part of its charm; it's simplicity gives Hitchcock a lot of room to work with, and really develop every last detail to create its greatest impact. The fact that the film survived almost fifty years (and a remake) proves that all the work paid off.The less said about the story, the better (in fact, the best thing to do is to go into this movie knowing as little information as possible). I will say this A woman (Marion Crane) has just stolen $40,000 from her boss and skipped town to join her boyfriend, and on the way she stops at a motel.There are two names (of real people) that are always going to be associated with Psycho Alfred Hitchcock and Anthony Perkins (arguably Janet Leigh would also be mentioned, but she doesn't create the impact that the other two do in my opinion). Both of them work wonders here. Hitchcock has created the perfect film; everything works so brilliantly that I can't even find words to describe it. Down to the last detail, Hitchcock meticulously constructed one of the most awesome and terrifying films ever to grace the screen.People may not remember Anthony Perkins' name, but anyone who has heard of Psycho will recognize the name Norman Bates (which is the point of acting, though the opposite is the case in today's world). That is how effective his performance is. I recently watched The River Wild, where Kevin Bacon does a terrific job of portraying a character who is sympathetic in the beginning and a total psychopath later on. Anthony Perkins accomplishes the same thing, and his performance is a lot more effective. At the beginning, he's a young, boyish sort of man who is a motor-mouth at the beginning because he is absolutely smitten with the beautiful woman who has just stopped at his hotel. His charming personality slowly turns to being a frightening one as the movie goes on, and this is accomplished with the same effectiveness. It is especially noteworthy that he does this completely in sync with Hitchcock's direction.The other actors are understandably overshadowed by the Hitchcock and Perkins, but to their credit no one can hold a candle to what they accomplished. Actually, the other performances are very strong. The females are the most successful, especially Vera Miles. Miles is the perfect anchor for the film. She finds a balance between anxiety and determination. Even though she is not given much to work with, she creates a sympathetic sister. Wide-eyed Janet Leigh is also good (though she overacts slightly at times) as Marion Crane, and her scene when she talks to Norman is delicately handled (though even she can't help but be out-shined by Perkins). Martin Balsam brings a noirish feel to his character, but he still fits right in. Like Perkins, John Gavin has a change of character, though he goes from charming to determined instead of psychotic. Gavin makes Sam Loomis easy to sympathize with.James Berardinelli, a film critic that I greatly respect, said that Psycho is not Alfred Hitchcock's greatest film is not his best because it lacks the story and character complexity of Rear Window and Vertigo, the latter of which I have not seen. I respectfully disagree. Why? Because it doesn't need them. Psycho's simplicity works to its advantage, and it's clockwork like procession adds a deeper level of fear that a film with more complexity in any area would not be able to create.I often say that Halloween is the scariest movie of all time. Strangely, though, I gave that film an 8\/10 and this one a 10\/10. The reason is because while Halloween is one of the most frightening films I have ever seen (and in some parts scarier than this one), it is not without flaws. Psycho is flawless and, maybe because it's been a few years since I have seen John Carpenter's film (and a lifetime before I will see it again), more polished. I also said that Halloween creates a high level of suspense with minimal violence, and that is true, but Psycho does it with even less.Earlier in this review I said that it is better to go into this film knowing as little as possible. This is true, though Psycho is so well-known that many people already know a lot about it, especially the ending twist. I was one of those unfortunate souls who knew about it, and while I have to admit that a lot of the impact was lost because of this, Hitchock still delivers the goods well enough to warrant a viewing.Psycho was remade shot for shot by Gus van Sant in 1998. It would be interesting to see what difference there is in the two versions (though I've heard the remake is terrible). Still, I'm going to see the remake and be the judge. But maybe I'm making a mistake, for the reported awfulness of the remake may taint the praise I have for the original. That said, nothing, not even Halloween, can hold a candle to Psycho.

Originally this was meant to be Bergman's swan song and while I would have been a great film to go out on, I'm glad he eventually returned to the director's chair a couple times. This film, running nearly five hours in its complete form, is certainly one of the most beautiful movies that I've ever seen. The technical side of things are downright brilliant but the incredible screenplay and performances make this one of the greatest achievements ever captured on film. The screenplay offers up so much detail and so much thought on so many topics that it's hard to really make your mind up about the film but I'm sure this is the type of movie that a hundred people could watch and they'd all walk away with different feelings and emotions about what it all meant.For me personally, I think the film is about everything possible, from life to death to love to religion and most importantly to imagination. The movie tackles all sorts of subjects, which were very familiar to Bergman and that's why I'd call this a greatest hits type of packaging from the director. We have issues dealing with death, which we saw in Cries and Whispers. We have the ideas of religion and what it means via his trilogy including Winter Lights. We have ideas of the theater, which the director hit upon in many of his overlooked gems from the 1970's. We also have the beauty of life and love, which we've seen several times from the master.On the technical side of things there's a lot to admire here. The visual look is quite striking and breathtaking especially the early sequences with the frozen river. The love how the first third of the movie, with the family together, is shown in very rich and vivid colors that really brings out a warm feeling of family and comfort. The middle stuff with the bishop changes to pale colors, which really brings out the coldness of all the characters during this time. We then shift to the grandmother's house, which is full of spring like colors, which offer up a sense of safety. The cinematography by Sven Nykvist really is something to watch as he perfectly captures every mood, feeling and thought going on within the film. He, like the director, was already considered a master by the time this film was released and this movie just adds to his legendary status.The performances are among some of the greatest I've ever seen. I think the standout performance of the film belongs to Jan Malmsjo as the evil bishop. If this isn't one of the greatest villains in film history then I'm not sure how you would define the term villain. What really impressed me about Malmsjo is his utter coldness whenever he talks, walks or whenever we simply see him thinking. The boy-faced nature on the outside also makes us, at times, feel for him and want to like him but that coldness and evilness is always right there to remind us what a snake he is. Jarl Kulle is also worth pointing out as the loverboy\/brother who has a terrific scene where he squares off against Malmsjo in an attempt to get the children back. The outright anger and frustration the actor shows in this scene is very chilling and one can't help but understand and feel everything he's doing. Ewa Froling is also terrific as Emile and the strength she brings to her character ranks this as one of the greatest performances I've seen from any actress. Bertil Guve is also worth mentioning as Alexander. He doesn't have too much to say but it's rather amazing how much Bergman got out of the young actor just by his facial gestures and body movements.The screenplay is another thing as beauty as, for the most part, we get all dialogue but the dialogue is so well written that all of the heart, sadness and fear comes from it. There are some rather hard to watch scenes including one involving a cane, which is used to beat on of the children. I couldn't help but jump every time the cane hit the body because the screenplay sets up the evilness of the bishop so well that this scene contains alternate emotions. We also have great talk about the meaning of fact and an illusion, which includes talk of actors and how they react to real situations. There's also a great conversation about the Jewish family, being magicians and what effect this has on their theories of God. Then, there's the religious aspect, which Bergman once again attacks with questions and thoughts about the truth behind a higher being. In reality, I believe this film is about the two kids but mainly everything is seen through the eyes of Alexander. All of the subjects hinted at and talked about throughout the film are from a child's eyes and this is something brave to try from Bergman. The honesty and wild wonder of a child's questions are really, to me, what this film is all about and it's brilliantly done by the great director. There are even sequences with Alexander seeing ghosts with a running theme of if he is really seeing them or if they are just in his head.What's most amazing is that the film runs five hours yet there isn't a single second of the film where the viewer can get bored. There's so much drama, pain, laughter and fears that this carries the film the entire running time and I really wish the film had gone on another five hours.

There are some rather hard to watch scenes including one involving a cane, which is used to beat on of the children. I couldn't help but jump every time the cane hit the body because the screenplay sets up the evilness of the bishop so well that this scene contains alternate emotions. We also have great talk about the meaning of fact and an illusion, which includes talk of actors and how they react to real situations. There's also a great conversation about the Jewish family, being magicians and what effect this has on their theories of God. Then, there's the religious aspect, which Bergman once again attacks with questions and thoughts about the truth behind a higher being. In reality, I believe this film is about the two kids but mainly everything is seen through the eyes of Alexander. All of the subjects hinted at and talked about throughout the film are from a child's eyes and this is something brave to try from Bergman. The honesty and wild wonder of a child's questions are really, to me, what this film is all about and it's brilliantly done by the great director. There are even sequences with Alexander seeing ghosts with a running theme of if he is really seeing them or if they are just in his head.What's most amazing is that the film runs five hours yet there isn't a single second of the film where the viewer can get bored. There's so much drama, pain, laughter and fears that this carries the film the entire running time and I really wish the film had gone on another five hours.

It's funny because a couple days earlier I was telling a friend of mine that I never turn off a movie no matter how much I hate it because you never know if something good will eventually happen. The first ten minutes of this film had me bored to tears. By the twenty-minute mark I was ready to scratch my eyes out. By the thirty-minute mark I was thinking of ways to kill myself but then the film got slightly better but then again, I still hated it. Robin Williams as Popeye, Shelley Duvall as Olive Oyl and Paul L. Smith as Bluto were certainly great choices to play the parts but the screenplay here is so God-awful that not even God himself could have pulled the film off. For starters, I'm really not sure what the plot was suppose to be about as it seemed like they were just remaking various cartoons and putting them in any order that they felt like. There's never a complete story to pull us through an extremely long running time of 114-minutes. The movie is remarkably flat, lacks any real energy and I'm not sure what Altman was doing in the director's chair. The musical numbers were also very poorly written and come off very lame and pathetic. I did end up laughing at a few scenes including the boxing match and another scene where Popeye meets his father. I know this film had a troubled history and I even read that Dustin Hoffman was originally going to play Popeye and I'm really curious how that would have turned out. There must be some secret to this film because there have been a lot of great reviews for it but whatever people like Roger Ebert saw in this thing went right over my head.

Most viewers surely root for the players and coach.In addition, Hoosiers has, on the surface, many very interesting external and internal character conflicts. The coach, played by Gene Hackman, battles the town's old-timers, who are resistant to outsiders and anyone with new ideas and methods. The coach also battles players unaccustomed to working hard on defense and passing as well as a teacher\/assistant principal who is more interested in academics than sports.The stories of a drunk ex-basketball star being given a chance to be an assistant coach and a star player who won't join the team until he respects the coach are also, on the surface, compelling.Hoosiers, though, is not the first movie I've seen. In fact, I've watched plenty of movies that have excellent stories like Hoosiers does, but also have way more depth beneath the surface. In short, this movie is way too formulaic and unsurprising to be great.How was Hoosiers unsurprising? As I watched Hackman's character meet and argue with the teacher played by Barbara Hershey, I jotted down a prediction that they would have a romance. Check.

This is Allen doing another Ingmar Bergman impersonation and for the most part he pulls it off. The film runs 80-minutes, which is both a good thing and a bad thing. The good thing is that Allen takes his time telling the story and there are a few parts that drag so I'm glad the film didn't run any longer. However, I think part of the reason the film drags is because some of the supporting characters, like Rowlands' husband, aren't written out enough so perhaps a longer film could have done this. As with Bergman and Allen's previously made Interiors, this film certainly isn't going to be for everyone due to how depressing and dark it is but Allen's dialogue and the cinematography by Sven Nykvist really makes for a beautiful picture. Rowlands is extremely good in her role and she carries enough intelligence that she doesn't need dialogue to get her feelings across. One of the final scenes between Rowlands and her brother is incredibly touching without any long speeches needed. Farrow is also very good in her few scenes in the film as is Ian Holm but I wish his character would have been a tad bit better written.

I got what I had expected and so much more. Just to think I came across this movie by luck, before I had never even heard of it. It's a German film made in 1993 so I suppose I can't be surprised that it's almost completely unknown to the modern American audience. It's a shame cause this really is a remarkable film, I dare say that its as good if not better then Platoon, Full metal jacket, Apocalypse now, and All quiet on the western front; all of which are iconic war movies.1942 World War II is in full swing. Nazi Germany has over run Mainland Europe and parts of North Africa, then Adolf Hitler orders the full scale invasion of the Soviet Union. A fateful move that ultimately dooms Nazi Germany to defeat. In the early stages the invasion goes well and the German Armies conquer large sections of Soviet territory, but a critical battle ensues at Stalingrad, A city that hold great symbolic & strategic value. The battle soon turns into a blood bath of epic proportions, a nightmare for both the German & Russian soldiers fighting. On the verge of taking the city the Germans are suddenly counter attacked by the Russians who end up cutting off the entire German 6th Army inside Stalingrad. To make matters worse, the Russian winter arrives causing incredible suffering for the Germans. This entire battle is seen through the eyes of a few young German soldiers fighting for survival not only against the Russians and the harsh winter conditions but also against their own Sadistic officers who care only about medals & glory and the generals who have little regard for the average foot soldier.This film is going to haunt me for a while. The German Soldiers the film concentrates on are so young and naive, then their humanity & sanity are stripped from them and you really do feel sorry for them cause their not the demonic Nazi's often portrayed in film. Everything they were fighting for is no longer important, and everything they believed in was shattered, and after fighting a gruesome battle against the Russians inside Stalingrad we see them further deteriorate with the onset of Winter causing many to freeze to death. The Battle & Winter scenes were like a horrible nightmare but it also felt so real. It's amazing, in the beginning we see strapping young men in the prime of their life, and at the end they a shells of their former selves stripped of everything. After witnessing so much carnage these men just loose their will to live on, it was really sad. When there is finally a moment of hope they are betrayed by Hitler who ultimately abandons these men to a horrible death, which is just another one of Hitler's crimes abandoning the men who fought for him to be slaughtered by the Russians. A good Anti-War film depicts the horrors of war and that's what this movie does. The battle for the tractor factory sequence Is the closest thing that comes to hell on earth, but that's really what The Battle for Stalingrad was like. The German & Russian soldiers were depicted with humanity, it was only the bad apples (specifically on the German side) that doomed the men. Bottom line is this film is amazing cause we see how men breakdown physically & emotionally during war. We all have our limits and these men were pushed far beyond their limits in the most deadly battle of our time. What the average foot soldier endured at Stalingrad was beyond imagination.

Whether it's Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon in Some Like It Hot or Greta Garbo in Queen Christina, I just can't accept that people around them are fooled by very bad disguises.Tootsie is no different. Dustin Hoffman was superb as Michael Dorsey, but he was just not credible as Dorothy Michaels. Dorothy just doesn't look, talk, nor dress like any woman I've ever seen.Besides, Dorsey &#150; like the Curtis, Lemmon and Garbo characters &#150; acts stupid. You'd think he'd breathe a sigh of relief after each work day that he wasn't unmasked. Instead, he dramatically increases his chances of getting caught by spending a weekend as a woman with Jessica Lange's Julie Nichols character, not inventing a boyfriend so men won't pursue him\/her, and stunningly, uttering a pickup line as Dorsey to Nichols that Nichols told Michaels she wanted to hear.Nichols was beyond dumb not to realize Michaels was Dorsey. Even their names were very similar. And how could no one working for the soap opera he\/she acted on nor the magazine and TV reporters who interviewed him\/her not be suspicious of a middle-aged person with no proof of a pre-soap opera life?Given my history of cynicism, though, I have to accept that I will never find cross-dressing disguises credible and judge Tootsie by other criteria, including its many funny scenes. The best laughs occur while Dorsey is talking to his roommate (played by Bill Murray) or his agent (played by Sydney Pollack). Murray and Pollack, the movie's director, are superb.The best thing about Tootsie, though, is that its well-written script has a lot of heart. While pretending to be a woman, Dorsey inspires other women on the soap opera to be more assertive and less accepting of misogynistic behavior by standing up to men and he transforms his TV character into someone who inspires females around the U.S. to become more independent. Being treated as an inferior as Michaels also gives Dorsey a new perspective that makes him more respectful toward women.Dorsey also exhibits heart by choosing friends over wealth. He only wants to make enough money in TV to ensure that a play written by Murray will be produced and give a financially struggling friend played by Teri Garr a co-starring role.

Curtis Hanson's The River Wild lives up to the challenge, even for someone who knows a thing or two about going down rivers like these (albeit not as violent).Storywise, it's pretty much your stock story from the genre A family with a crumbling marriage goes on a trip where they meet up with some seemingly nice people who turn out to be criminals of some sort. That's the story in a nutshell. What elevates this story from being routine is a smart script and terrific performances.There are two reasons in which The River Wild is more successful than the other members of the genre (not counting the performances), and both have to do with Denis O'Neill's script. One, he knows the ins and outs of whitewater rafting down a river and uses it to his advantage, and two, he has an intricate knowledge of family dynamics. By themselves each one of these qualities would elevate the project, but together they make it great. And it helps that Curtis Hanson's direction compliments the script nicely.Meryl Streep may have top billing, but while she is excellent in the quiet scenes, she's less impressive as when she turns into the action heroine. She seems miscast in an action movie, and unfortunately that's what she does for most of the movie. Still, she's not bad. And in the quieter scenes, she shines as only Meryl Streep can. To her credit, she has excellent chemistry with her costars, especially her on-screen husband, David Strathairn. Their conflict is a routine one (she's the wife while he's the workaholic husband), but the script explores this conflict in a deeper and more refreshing way, and both Streep and Stratharin are both so endearing that it works better than one could have hoped.Kevin Bacon is the real scene stealer here. His performance as Wade is top-notch. He's charming in the beginning, and creepy later on. He has perfect chemistry with young Joeseph Mazzello as Streep's son, Rourke. He's charming enough that the audience has no trouble believing that Rourke would be won over by Wade, especially because he acts like any child in his position would act. And he's very creepy later on, but loses none of his charm. Before seeing the movie, I thought John C.

I always heard buzz about this film, and I have not seen many Martin Scorsese films, but this is a true American movie! The screenplay is a true force to be reckoned with. It reminded me a bit of other epic films like Citizen Kane and There Will be Blood, the way the main character plays out is similar, but this film is different, as in the character Jake La Motta is based on a real person. Martin Scorsese really commanded the screen. There are truly some amazingly written and acted scenes. This is a boxing film, but a very much human film too. Robert De Niro really gave his best, and it turns out to be one of the best performances I have ever seen! His performance ranges from his bad times, to his guilt, to his madness and anger. It is all played out perfectly. Joey La Motta, his brother, played brilliantly by Joe Pesci is also a strong supporting character, who follows Jake through a lot. Another strong character is Vicky Thailer, played by the back then unknown Cathy Moriarty. What these three characters go through is amazing. This film is a joy to watch too. Certain scenes, some sensuality between Jake and Vicky are not really sexually graphic, yet have so much pleasure in them, the way Scorsese teases us. Scenes like where Jake suspects Vicky and Joey together, and in their fight all of a sudden are so well done and acted, I could not stare away.This film is from the 1940s through 1950s, so there are a lot of gorgeous set designs. The costumes, the cinematography are all beautiful too look at. The decision to make this film black and white really helps. There are amazing camera shots, amazing techniques that are used, and the sound in the boxing scenes is perfection.This film is a classic for a reason. It is pure entertainment too, and it is so well done and executed no one can be disturbed. It is one of the most enjoyable, amazingly acted films I have ever seen. A film that everyone should see, if not for De Niro's amazing performance, then for the amazing writing and directing!

Although I feel like it contained some really great performances, from everyone really including the supporting cast (especially George Dzundza and John Savage) but especially De Niro, Walken and Streep, ultimately I think the film was a bit heavy-handed and at times improbable. The details of the Vietnamese POW camp feel exaggerated, although the two scenes with Russian roulette were very powerful. It was really odd that De Niro could just walk back into Saigon though at that point.What I liked best about the movie was the way De Niro's performance changed so subtly in the parts of the movie when he returns home after the war. He conveys a totally different state of mind -- again the film hammers the point home more than it really needs to by including that whole scene with him deliberately missing the stag he's tracking. De Niro's acting alone would suffice, I've rarely seen him stronger. Same with Walken, he really was excellent in this movie especially at the end when he seems almost literally like a ghost.Was the ending supposed to be satirical? I don't think so but it was a little over the top with them all singing God Bless America. I just couldn't buy it.One thing that I felt was that it is possible to see the movie as De Niro's character being in love with Walken's. At the end he tells him I love you, (SPOILERS) similar to Sam Fuller's I Shot Jesse James. I think that he and the Streep character were basically in love with the same man.

They're peppered throughout the story and offer needed breaks as it becomes more and more apparent that Joseph Cotten's character, Uncle Charlie, just might be the 'Merry Widow Murderer' that a country wide manhunt is after.There's no doubting that Hitchcock is one of the great directors of American cinema, but once again, I find myself on the fence regarding this picture's reputation and my own reaction to it. Maybe I'm being a tad too critical, but just like with Strangers On A Train, I found the resolution to the story to be just a little too pat for my liking. Here was Uncle Charlie (Cotten), an athletic looking man revealed to be the killer of three widows for their inheritance, successfully challenged by his niece almost half his size. Would a murderer of his talent and skill allow himself to be angled into a position as to fall off a train into the path of another because he just slipped? It's just too convenient a scenario to serve as the finale.What might have better served the picture would be to have the story actually support the title. Hitchcock did a nice job with the initial attempt on Young Charlie's (Teresa Wright) life using the doctored step on the stairway; not really sure if it was tampered with or not. The garage scene with the running car and Young Charlie 'trapped' could have been presented with an outcome that didn't make it obvious that the Uncle was behind it. Of course, the train scene makes it certain that Cotten's character is the widow maker, as he pulls out all the stops to take out his niece for what she suspects, but doesn't necessarily know for certain (although the ring inscribed with 'T.S. from B.M. was a pretty good clue). I guess what I'm saying is that the film would have worked a whole lot better for me if Uncle Charlie's murder history was maintained as a Shadow of a Doubt instead of a certainty. What I'm thinking is along the lines of 1938's Angels With Dirty Faces - it's up to the viewer to decide if Jimmy Cagney died a hero or a yellow rat. It makes for a much livelier debate.Aside from that, the film did hold my interest all the way through, with well presented performances by the principals, along with Henry Travers, Patricia Collinge, MacDonald Carey and Hume Cronyn in good support roles. Ma Newton (Colllinge) did a nice job of putting two and two together in a very low key scene, and it was rewarding to know that she 'got it' regarding her brother's presence back home.Say, there was one scene that took me way back to when I first learned to drive a car.

Here was Uncle Charlie (Cotten), an athletic looking man revealed to be the killer of three widows for their inheritance, successfully challenged by his niece almost half his size. Would a murderer of his talent and skill allow himself to be angled into a position as to fall off a train into the path of another because he just slipped? It's just too convenient a scenario to serve as the finale.What might have better served the picture would be to have the story actually support the title. Hitchcock did a nice job with the initial attempt on Young Charlie's (Teresa Wright) life using the doctored step on the stairway; not really sure if it was tampered with or not. The garage scene with the running car and Young Charlie 'trapped' could have been presented with an outcome that didn't make it obvious that the Uncle was behind it. Of course, the train scene makes it certain that Cotten's character is the widow maker, as he pulls out all the stops to take out his niece for what she suspects, but doesn't necessarily know for certain (although the ring inscribed with 'T.S. from B.M. was a pretty good clue). I guess what I'm saying is that the film would have worked a whole lot better for me if Uncle Charlie's murder history was maintained as a Shadow of a Doubt instead of a certainty. What I'm thinking is along the lines of 1938's Angels With Dirty Faces - it's up to the viewer to decide if Jimmy Cagney died a hero or a yellow rat. It makes for a much livelier debate.Aside from that, the film did hold my interest all the way through, with well presented performances by the principals, along with Henry Travers, Patricia Collinge, MacDonald Carey and Hume Cronyn in good support roles. Ma Newton (Colllinge) did a nice job of putting two and two together in a very low key scene, and it was rewarding to know that she 'got it' regarding her brother's presence back home.Say, there was one scene that took me way back to when I first learned to drive a car. Do you recall Jack Graham (Carey) using a stick shift on the column when driving his car - when's the last time you saw that?

The storytelling resonated so intensely with childhood memories and emotions, the effects were intoxicating. The opening line sets the stage for you to be taken back through your own experiences I'm not going to tell the story the way it happened. I'm going to tell it the way I remember it. However, one of the critical scenes was just absolutely butchered preventing the movie from being great or considered a classic. The first few scenes do a great job of reminding you of your childhood and the excitement of those fun adventures you had. Maybe you were only a few blocks from your house, but you and your friends considered your adventures grand nonetheless. Of course Finn's 'adventure' is a bit more dramatic than anything anyone would care to have their child experience, the danger and mystery it represents rekindles those memories.The basic plot is a standard, blue collar kid (Finn played by Hawke) falls in love with socialite (Estella played by Paltrow). Finn meets his love under unusual circumstances which continues to haunt him throughout the film. While he greatly appreciates anytime he spends with her, its revealed that she not 'slumming it' as a distraction, shes sharpening her 'heart-breaking' skills. This adds additional drama for the audience since Finn obviously is unaware of this treachery. Yes the general premise of unrequited teenage love is not new and it is a bit predictable. However, the way it is portrayed in this film is something you will be hard pressed to find in any other film with a similar plot. This story is typically presented in some low budget B-movie with poor acting, cinematography, and blunt sophomoric humor to keep the script from dragging to badly. Alfonso Cuarón's creation is well put together with pleasing visuals and great acting that stirs emotions instead of reminding of our own analogous experiences.The intensity of bedroom scene gets you to question if Estellas 'training' will hold up or is she falling for him. This stirred the powerful and narcotic memories of those intense adolescent crushs. The aftermath of this scene is portrayed in a believable fashion that allows the audience to continue floating through the memories of the rebound.The hole comes in the taxi cab scene after Estella visits Finn. Instead of setting up a dramatic climax, it deflates the tension. The scene seems so poorly written or directed I just wince watching it. Tell him a lie, play coy, continue to tease him along, do something other than how the script is written here (yuck!!!). Shes being honest, but the dialogue seemed forced and is so unbelievable it forces you to admit your watching a movie and not in your minds eye any longer.The script doesn't seem up to par in the couple scenes following this, but its hard to know if its just a hangover from the previous scene or just forced advancement to the climax. Ms. Dinsmore (Bancroft) delivers the coup de grace to Finn and its all over. There's an intriguing sequence after this, but it doesn't really advance the movie but it would seem incomplete without. The conclusion is a bit open ended and I wonder how it would have been if it ended without this scene.Anyway the ability of this movie to make the audience feel those raw and innocent emotions of our childhoods is what makes this movie worth the watch. Flaws and all I'll watch frequently and listen to the soundtrack several times a month.

For the people who serve in the military, there is none of this lofty pretense about why they fight.Two of the more memorable lines in the film could have been made very kitschy, as is the typical style of Hollywood filmmakers. Unlike the war films of the 40's and 50's, BLACK HAWK DOWN is not a feel good movie that paints heroes in all white, and villains in all black. Unlike wear movies in the 60's and 70's, there isn't any internal angst about Why we're here. Unlike the movies of the 80's and 90's, BHD does not present gratuitous graphic violence, and does not try to shock you with the horrows of war. And, unlike SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, BHD is not weighted down by the star power of its cast, or the creds of the Director, or the cheesy -- yes, cheesy way it tries to portray the fog of war,such as when Tom Hank's character is temporarily rendered deaf by an explosion.In fact, there is a comparable seen in which two soldiers are pinned down, and attempting to cover each other as they reload. One soldier turns to his buddy and says, Quit firing that thing so close to my head, and, not more than a few seconds later, his buddy sees Somalis approaching from that side, and fires his automatic weapon right next to his head, and the other guy goes deaf.With anybody else at the helm instead of Ridley Scott, we would have gotten the now overdone, muffled silence, a la SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. b(There was a scene in BHD where Scott did hit the mute button, but it was only done as a means of creating the POV.I've been in a similar situation, standing next to a cannon, and being deafened momentarily.

Rangers and Delta force are trained to use hand signals to maintain silence, but the chaos of the battle in Mog as they called it, rendered that skill superfluous. BHD handled these scenes rather well.What makes this both a poignant and believable scene is that no soldier ever stops to think about, Gee, I'd better stop firing my weapon near his head, when he's got unfriendlies coming at them by the hundreds.And by the hundreds and thousands they came. Not disciplined Somali soldiers, but ever male who was old enough to carry a gun in a society where dying for your God in battle was glorified above all else.When you're a soldier, and you are alone, cut off from help, your first thought is to stay alive and your second is to do your job. When you're with one of your fellow's soldier, your first thought is keeping your buddy alive.This was the second time I had seen BHD, with the fist coming when it opened in theatres. It felt as though I was watching for the first time. The battles are as intense as it gets. What you see is not the typical, unrealistic scenes where some of the soldiers seem to get through it without a scratch.Not in BHD-- EVERY soldier was wounded in battle.Another realistic scene that most filmmakers ignore, is how often a soldier has to replace an empty ammo clip with a filled one. How many times have we seen guns being fired like they have an endless supply of bullets? Also, BHD doesn't make a seminal scene about it -- none of this slo-mo in watching the empty magazine being released and falling to the ground. As a total opposite of that, Scott not only has the soldiers accurately removing the empty magazine with their dominant hand, and loading in the hew one, BUT ONLY after they tap the FRONT of the magazine with their other hand or against their boot or helmet.WHY is that important? Because the bullets in a magazine do shift positions in all the movements in battle, and if the back of the bullets are not flush against the back of the magazine, they can jam the gun or misfire.People who know about weapons appreciate things like that.The movie wastes no time in getting into the heat of battle, and the scenes are so intense, so graphic, that you may want to wear a mouth guard to keep your teeth from clenching throughout it. Basicially, until the move is over, you don't move an inch because you really do feel like you may, yourself, get shot if you do.The musical score is superb as Ridley Scott again chose Hans Zimmer, as he did in Gladiator, to compose it. You may notice the similarities in it with Gladiator, as well.All in all, this is a ten out of ten. Not a perfect ten, mind you, but one that earned it the hard way.

There, for this movie Plan 9 From Outer Space, came up the name Edward Wood Jr as the producer, director and writer. I had seen the movie Ed Wood a few years back and remembered it as the story about some guy with a tiny budget and little talent for making movies who was a genius at scrounging up money to make them, finding washed up movie actors and somehow getting theaters to show them. I didn't know this guy was real. He was real! In the movie Ed Wood finds Bella Ligosi as his one star he needs to lend credibility to his productions he makes. Bella Ligosi shuffles about in despair, realizing his career is over. And when you see Plan 9 From Outer Space, you can see why. Plan 9 From Outer Space is one of those movies Ed Wood made! It would have been much more meaningful for me to have seen Plan 9 From Outer Space before seeing the movie Ed Wood. But now that I've seen Plan 9 From Outer Space it all makes more sense to me now. Both movies belong together as a set. Plan 9 From Outer Space captures the true cheesiness, the desperation and results of shoe string budgets, the lack of movie making skills and how those things all contributed to the basis of the plot upon which the movie Ed Wood was based. I think you will actually enjoy the movie Plan 9 From Outer Space. It is so bad, it's good! And I know it will make you enjoy the movie Ed Wood even more.

I had seen the movie Ed Wood a few years back and remembered it as the story about some guy with a tiny budget and little talent for making movies who was a genius at scrounging up money to make them, finding washed up movie actors and somehow getting theaters to show them. I didn't know this guy was real. He was real! In the movie Ed Wood finds Bella Ligosi as his one star he needs to lend credibility to his productions he makes. Bella Ligosi shuffles about in despair, realizing his career is over. And when you see Plan 9 From Outer Space, you can see why. Plan 9 From Outer Space is one of those movies Ed Wood made! It would have been much more meaningful for me to have seen Plan 9 From Outer Space before seeing the movie Ed Wood. But now that I've seen Plan 9 From Outer Space it all makes more sense to me now. Both movies belong together as a set. Plan 9 From Outer Space captures the true cheesiness, the desperation and results of shoe string budgets, the lack of movie making skills and how those things all contributed to the basis of the plot upon which the movie Ed Wood was based. I think you will actually enjoy the movie Plan 9 From Outer Space. It is so bad, it's good! And I know it will make you enjoy the movie Ed Wood even more.
