Yep that's right, way before we got ultra campy, neon lit Batman movies we got this, a campy, excessively colourful romp based (of course) on the Richard Matheson novel 'The Shrinking Man'. Yeah I know exactly what you're thinking, I'd never heard of this movie either, well judging by the films poster it doesn't look like anybody gave it much hope frankly, holy cheeseballs!So I think we know what's gonna happen here don't we. An everyday woman leading an everyday life falls afoul of a bizarre accident that causes her to slowly shrink down to a microscopic size. In this case its not a nuclear\/atomic bomb scenario, its not a mad experiment and its got nothing to do with potions and magic. In this movie the protagonist suffers from a serve reaction to an experimental perfume her husband is working on, along with various other household things. So yes...OK, it is about a weird experiment, but its not military based. Unfortunately despite the fact they have clearly tried to move away from the old formulaic notions that have surrounded previous movies like this, this new concept is really quite daft. Sure the entire notion of shrinking to the size of an ant is daft but...as a result of a perfume?? couldn't think of anything a bit better? What's even more ludicrous is the fact that despite it being a perfume\/household products related accident and perfume\/household products being a relatively innocent and unexciting plot device, they still manage to cram in a few nasty whitecoat scientist types because of course the perfume company gets taken over in part by dubious sources wanting to work out the shrinking mystery for their own dubious plans. Everything is entirely predictable of course, you know once Kramer starts to shrink their will be the media hype to content with, the humiliation, the rubbernecking etc...Along with that you know at some point evil people will try to kidnap her for their evil ways (obviously shrinking people around the world or their own armies), and there will be some kind of adventurous escape from a nasty old lab etc...Didn't really expect anything too mind blowing in all honesty, naturally this will take on many elements of the original source material, they have tried to go in a new direction, but I'm just not sure if this was the right way.I'm still not really sure what the colour scheme\/palette was about here either. All the sets, costumes, cars, props, everything, is an array of soft, outlandish, pastel colours that range from anything and everything. Think 'Dick Tracy', 'Miami Vice' or the 50's suburban housing estate in 'Edward Scissorhands' but in really really extreme camp colours. The weird thing were the outfits everybody wears, its was like some kind of retro 50's, 70's, 80's mishmash with suits in emerald green with bright pink ties etc...I'm guessing Schumacher wanted to create some kind of timeless hybrid that has never existed, a fantasy America where everything is kinda perfect, but scratch beneath the surface and its actually just like reality. Another odd thing was the usage of Lily Tomlin as multiple characters. Now I'm assuming this was down to her comedic background as others have done the same thing, the problem is others have done it way better. The silly thing was you can clearly tell its Tomlin, there is no real effort to not make her look any different, so in that sense its not really funny or clever (an Eddie Murphy challenge this is not). I might add her various characters aren't exactly very different from each other...and did I mention she isn't funny?Effects wise the movie does hold its own well and this is mainly down to the old old use of large scale props and sets. Tomlin looks great within the oversized sets and the forced perspective illusion, it just never fails to win that old trick. Naturally there are some hokey bluescreen moments but that can't really be helped. The best thing about the movie effects wise is easily Rick Baker and his gorilla suit. Now if you know your movies and special effects wizards then you know Baker has a gorilla fetish, a fetish he explores deeply here. Not only is his suit excellent in detail and movement, but Baker actually plays the gentle giant too. Think the gorilla from 'Trading Places' only better. The only stupid thing about that (along with all the other stupid stuff), is at the end the Kramer family decide to keep the gorilla as a pet, because that won't cause any problems will it (do I see a gorilla based sequel with hilarious gorilla shrinking antics??..no).Yeah so this was a pretty mixed bag really. The visuals are undoubtedly lovely to look at in places, very colourful and cheerful, good designs and creativity, but it doesn't really make much sense why its like that. The comedy is so so, the action and adventure is so so, the acting is unsurprisingly so so despite having a darn good line-up of old stars, and the finale is too sickly. Everything gets wrapped up in a nice harmless bow with literately every character there to witness it because...I dunno. Why does she shrink so rapidly right at the end? and why or how does the chemical spillage bring her back to normal size?? Meh, its a family movie heavy on light-hearted tomfoolery and nothing more, don't question it.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"28 November 2015","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Fun fact, this was Joel Schumacher's directorial debut.

All of his films are colored with the sweeping winds of romanticism. And perhaps no film exemplifies that better than this one. Listen to Lara's Theme and try to say that you don't feel like you've been swept up into the best parts of history and romance.What I find interesting about this genre is how it is both about history and is history. This whole style of filmmaking, this whole ideal of filmmaking, is as extinct as the Russian Revolution or World War I. Some would say this detracts from the film. I would not be among them. To me, all the different layers of history make this film far easier to get lost in than it would have been back in the sixties (not that it wasn't a big hit then; adjusted for inflation, this film is the eighth-highest-grossing of all time, and it collected five Oscars back in 1965.) Basically, this film is a love story set against the backdrop of the Russian Revolution. The titular Doctor Zhivago is played by Omar Shirif, making him one of the few people to play both a Russian and an Arab. Lara, his love, is played by Julie Chistie. Theirs is a tragic story that takes place all across Russia. It's the first film I ever saw that goes to Siberia for dramatic reasons and actually stays there for a while.I am always a sucker for well-done tragic love stories, which is good considering how many of them there are. Watching passion be followed by depression and silence has always given weight to tales, allowing people to open up to what they see on the screen or stage. This is a trend that's going to go away; it has been around since at least Ancient Greece and is well alive today, as shown by films like A Fault in Our Stars. They evolve, but they never change.Perhaps the reason this film remains a classic to this day is because it is both timely and timeless. You feel both the pull of the 1910s and the 1960s, and it matters because the themes at play here are those that everyone can identity with. Whenever I have a lot of free time on my hand for whatever reason, and it's cold and snowy outside (which is often, as I live in Colorado), I'll cue up this film, grab some hot chocolate, pull on some blankets, and just watch.Humanity has done a lot through the years, but we are physically the same as we were when we started planting seeds and settling down. The basic ideas that appeal to us are the same, so much so that whenever I watch a movie from a time long gone by about a time even further gone by, I feel like I'm almost tapping into long-repressed memories. There are no better cases for the power of film than that.And there are few movies that capture that evocative appeal better than this one.In case you were still wondering if the critics complained about long films as much as they do now, the answer is 'yes.' 200 minutes of epic romantic storytelling told against the backdrop of one of the most monumental events of the last century? Too long. Again, this reminds me of that scene in Amadeus where the Emperor cries out that his music has too many notes. While I may not be a great artist or a great critic, I can recognize genius when I see it, and this film is most certainly genius.The world romance seems trivialized nowadays. I blame Nicholas Sparks, but to each their own. Romance seems associated with either hack writing or old stories written centuries ago. But it does not have to be. It has long been said by poets, overly sappy or otherwise, that love is one of, if not the most powerful force known to man. There have been a few movies that get this and show the 'power' part. Every scene in this film, you feel the bond between Yuri Zhivago and Lara, even when they are not on screen together. The whole separated lovers shtick can get ridiculous at worst and dull at best when shown by someone who either doesn't get how to write a film\/book\/whatever, or doesn't know how to write a love story.

The man was in love with the idea of being in love, as shown by the fact that he got married six times. There are few love stories in film more potent than this one. Every time you see Yuri sit down and write poems to her, you feel what he feels that hot, heartfelt embrace over the cold crust of the Russian tundra.In retrospect, it makes sense how much money this film made.

The first time I watched it I didn't care much for the film or the characters but after about 10-15 viewings it's gotten to the point that the last 40 minutes have me on the verge of tears. The reason is that each time I watch it I learn more about the character and it becomes such a tragedy as you watch. The camera work in the film is so beautiful and based on the other films I've seen from before this film came out it seems that this was the first movie to make the camera itself a character.

Everyone knows it, not everyone wants to accept it. Goodfellas--based on true events--explores the lives of gangsters, chronicling the events through the eyes of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), who gets involved with the Mafia at a young age and continues his career throughout the film.As he gets older, he marries and has children, but still works for the organized crime family, under mob boss Paulie (Paul Sorvino); and he is friends with Jimmy (Robert De Niro), a calm, steady gangster; and Tommy (Joe Pesci), a wild man with serious mental problems. Eventually Henry's life goes down the gutter, leading to drug abuse and paranoia, that leads to other unfortunate incidents that will be ruined if I type any more about them.Goodfellas is one of the best films I have ever seen. It's a tour the force of breathtaking images, witty scriptwriting, superb acting and realistic violence.Robert De Niro gives one of his best performances -- ever -- as Jimmy, even if he's not in the film as much as you might be lead to believe from the front cover.Joe Pesci is in this movie about as much as De Niro, maybe a bit more or less. But when he's on screen there's no doubting he's on screen--he's very hard to miss. A short, deranged, loud-mouthed man with something wrong in his head. Someone makes an insult toward him and he shoots them, and then laughs. It's quite disturbing. I am a huge fan of Pesci, and I tend to love his characters, but he really makes you feel sick towards his character in Goodfellas, while at the same time taking a strange liking to him. That just goes to show how good of an actor Pesci is.Ray Liotta is perfect as Henry Hill. I can't think of a better actor to play him. He captures a sense of innocence yet at the same time a feeling of violence. I love the scene where he walks over to a man's house with a regular expression on his face. What do you want, f&*^&? the man asks. Liotta continues walking, takes out a gun, and starts to continually beat the man in the skull with the butt of his gun. As Henry walks back to his car, his face is disturbing and his expression stays with you for a long, long time.Martin Scorsese is a brilliant director and his work here is fabulous; it's been recreated by other directors (namely Paul Thomas Anderson in Boogie Nights) and there's a reason it's great stuff. He totally deserved to receive Best Director in 1990, but of course he didn't. (Rumor has it the Academy frowns on Scorsese's use of racial slurs in his work. Oh, get over it.)

The movie is all about Walter and Hildy, a divorced couple whose relationship really never worked out for them and now Hildy is going to get married again to man named Bruce Baldwin. Hildy used to work on the newspaper that Burns is editor of but has since realised the journalist's world is not for her and she wants to settle down in Albany with her new husband. Of course the plot never quite goes smoothly, Walter wants Hildy back on the job being his star reporter but she simply doesn't want to go back and not even a murder case where the accused may be innocent will tempt her back in when Walter first asks. The movie is a great mix of fast humour and wit, sarcasm but also just generally great characters and although some are pretty unlikeable, they are well acted throughout the movie.The two big stars of this are Cary Grant (Walter) and Rosalind Russell (Hildy) and they bring with them an expert class of acting that really makes this comedy come alive. The film even suffers slightly when we don't have say Grant in the picture for a little while, for me he is the stand out and some of the lines he is given are delivered with incredible style. The whole cast are pretty good to be fair too, Ralph Bellamy as Bruce is good and plays ever so well when the film see's Walter basically mocking the man without his knowing. The character of Earl Williams is very strangely funny, just his voice works to get most of the jokes out well and another character too Mr Pettibone adds to the speedy plot that never stops for breath.Howard Hawks brings the film in nice style to the screen and really brings the most out the actors at his disposal. It is Hawks who gets the film really going fast and also he that sets up this busy style film where everyone seems to rush in and out of a room in a split second. The adaption of the play The Front Page comes out funny on the big screen I mean this movie is never laugh out loud funny not really but it is the true intelligence of all involved that makes it really good. I think if anything stops it from being perfect then it is the fact that the middle and end can feel a little flimsy but all in all never breaks up, the actual end scene is very very fast and ends the movie is a way you probably won't be expecting.So His Girl Friday is just a real classic and one I couldn't recommend more to people, I know some will think they will not like it but I watched this twice in two days not because I loved it so much but because after the first viewing I knew I had missed many gags and knew it was better than I thought it was. Some could say this movie is also one of the very best in the careers of Grant and Russell, both give stunning performances so much so that after viewing this film and researching it I expected them to have taken some awards home for this but no. So anyway a screwball comedy that really makes you laugh but it is also really interesting as well, the kind of movie that if watched right, you won't take your eyes off it for a second.

Yes, there are enormous flaws with Episode I, but like every other film in the series, the good moments don't just excuse the bad; they topple them. The Phantom Menace follows Jedi Knight Qui- God Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi as they escort Queen Amidala on her travels to the planet Coruscant, hoping to find a peaceful end to an interplanetary trade dispute. They also encounter Anakin Skywalker, before he became a Jedi, who appears to have unusually strong powers of the Force. I was definitely surprised by how much I enjoyed the movie based on how much hate it has received. Being the first movie in a trilogy, The Phantom Menace is going to feature a lot of exposition and many seemingly stock characters. I would hope many of the plot lines and character arcs are continued in the next couple of movies because, but I have to at least give it the benefit of the doubt for now. The movie's good moments made me completely forget many of the bad ones that came before it. The pod race in particular was stunning as well as the final fight with Darth Maul; showing the Jedi in their prime made the lightsaber fights more fast-paced and exciting. Even though I enjoyed the movie, I can completely understand the hatred it has accumulated over the years. If I was a big fan of the original series, and I had to wait sixteen years for this, I would be pretty disappointed as well. Maybe being a Star Wars virgin allowed me to enjoy Episode I more than I should have, but, at least for me, The Phantom Menace was the most visually impressive and maybe even the most fun Star Wars movie yet by continuing to showcase the series' creativity and imagination.

A tyrant is in control of the fictitious African country of Zangaro. The local people are oppressed. A British mining company eyes the country for its deposits of a rare mineral. A rebel leader in exile has designs on a coup and taking over the rule of the country. The industrialists and he strike up a deal. The mining group hires Jammie Shannon to organize and lead a mercenary force to overthrow the reigning tyrant, and install the new tyrant who will be friendly to the money mongers. Shannon goes to the country to scout it out and he is tortured by the leader's henchmen. So, he also has a personal score to settle. Christopher Walken plays Shannon, and he assembles a group of former fellow mercenaries. They do the job, but it's not quite how the exiled rebel leader, the mining moguls or the reigning tyrant expected. For all of their killing and mayhem, the mercenaries have something of a code of ethics. The personal danger in films like this is that a person may find oneself applauding or favoring the killing of many people. However bad they are, this is violence on a large scale. Walken and the entire cast do very well in this action thriller. It was filmed in Belize. The movie is based on a novel by British author Frederick Forsyth (born Aug. 25, 1938). He is one of the more popular authors of crime-suspense-thriller-action stories on whose books movies have been made since the third quarter of the last century. Two other such authors are John le Carré and John Grisham. Forsyth had considerable experiences and background in the milieu in which his novels are set. Forsyth was an RAF fighter pilot during the Cold War, and is a former newspaper reporter and spy. He joined Reuters news service in 1961 and the BBC in 1965. During that time, he served as an assistant diplomatic correspondent. He had covered the Nigerian civil war in 1967 when the BBC decided to end its coverage in favor of the growing coverage of the Viet Nam war. So, Forsyth quit the BBC and returned to Biafra on his own. He spent two years reporting on and observing that civil war as he wrote his first book. During that time and for some 20 years, he worked as a spy for M16 British Intelligence. Several of Forsyth's books have been made into movies &#x96; some with considerable alteration. His books have sold more than 70 million copies. The fictional country in this movie is based upon Equatorial Guinea, which once was a Spanish colony. Among Forsyth's other best- selling novels that have been made into movies are The Odessa File in 1974, The Fourth Protocol in 1987, The Day of the Jackal in 1997, the TV movie, Icon, in 2005, and Avenger, another TV movie in 2006.The expression dogs of war may first have been used by William Shakespeare. It appears in a line from his 1599 play, Julius Caesar. In Act III, Scene 1, Antony bereaves the murder of Caesar and says loudly toward the end, Cry 'Havoc!' and let slip the dogs of war. Another film, about WW II, used part of this same line. Cry Havoc of 1943 was about the Army nurses on Bataan who were caring for the Allied wounded and who became prisoners of the Japanese.

I thought the film was brilliant, some really powerful performances and many huge stars now in their youth; Diane Keaton, Al Pacino and James Caan. The film has not aged well, but is still gripping and interesting, and in place visceral and emotional. James Caan as the protective older brother was memorable but of course Marlon Brando stands out as the much parodied, copied and admired main character to whom everyone defers. As I said, the film has dated and his prosthesis padded mouth doesn't look so good as I imagine it did when first released, and the make-up on Pacino was also distractingly bad. The film jumps forward in time quickly, and doesn't explain anything, as films are wont to do more latterly, which is refreshing, and the plot is complex enough to require full attention, and whilst it's not a laugh a minute enjoyable film, or about subject matter which is pleasant, is bloody and violent, it is worth watching and certainly one of cinema's most brilliant masterpieces. I think my impression of this film is lessened by the fact that I didn't see it for until now so didn't have the loyalty to The Family that longtime watchers have, when they've grown up with it, but it was amazing to finally see the original from which many other films have taken their cue or inspiration.

Woody, and therefore Cliff, shoots this way because for him, there is no difference between Lester's real and documentary life; they are both shallow, worthless and rubbish. This is a departure from the usual Woody character - still neurotic, still high-minded and cultured, but this particular one is rather needy, somewhat pathetic. He prides himself on staying away from the Hollywood-esque success that Lester has garnered, and prefers more personal, meaningful works. One he is working on about an elderly philosopher who spouts vague truths about love and life blows up embarrassingly in his face when this wise man commits suicide. Lester openly insults his career by admitting he is only asking him as a favour to his sister, Cliff's wife. At the end of the film, Cliff feels like he deserves the love of Halley, another like-minded, smart and attractive individual (and he has been vicariously substituting this hollow in his life, in the wake of his waning marriage, with his young niece), and cannot even think why she would choose Lester over him (who reminds him of Mussolini). And so it haunts him endlessly. Dually, there is another closely linked with the family who is being haunted. Judah's affair is catching up with him, threatening both his personal and financial life, and there remains no choice. Landau is the best of the cast, and shows it here; watch how he tries to convince himself that the idea of the murder is not his idea, watch how he rambles endlessly about morality but cannot seem to remember why he called his brother for assistance. But for a crime of this magnitude, four months later he is seemingly at peace, while Cliff mourns newly. Crimes and Misdemeanors is not about how he got away with it - this is irrelevant and happens with ease - but how he deals with the fact he got away with it.Allen employs a few significant techniques to both these characters in moments of strife. The first is the silence, save for maybe the hum of a car engine or the crackling of a telephone, as the character's mind wanders incessantly on their troubles. This makes the music so much more dreadful when it finally cues in; in a particularly creepy sequence which follows the murderer, the previous lovers who found themselves together in Schubert now become confronted with death with his String Quartet 15, a moment of wonderful agitation without ever showing any action or violence. Another is the slow zoom in to a character's face as they are hit with horrible news, which is frequently coupled with the use of visual flashbacks which contrast the now cold and frightening reality. Levey's suicide, the murder of Paley...In one case Judah even consciously argues at length about morality with his memories of a Jewish dinner (this scene is very Allen) and this represents his full conscious awareness of his sin, and his desperation to justify it. Meanwhile, in a blow of cruel symbolism, the rabbi, the one moral centre, is blind by the end of the film, while the ophthalmologist is seeing clearer than ever. Another theme is the blurring of the boundaries between fiction and reality. We saw this first with Cliff shooting Lester, and also in the many cuts from reality straight into a movie that Cliff might be watching, which closely mirror the events of the story. Allen manages to conjure some of his humour from this tale; the hilarious way in which Mussolini is compared to Lester, the voyeuristic and aggressive manner that he films Lester flirting with the women in the workplace, and in one scene, the darkness of Judah's story almost invades into Cliff's. His sister is recounting a horrifying date incident, and we curl up in revulsion, waiting for that fateful word, before it is suddenly replaced with another. If it was rape Cliff might react with a subtle horror and rage, but in this case he flies off the handles and reacts with much more indignation than necessary, and it is very funny. Allen seems to readily announce that this is not a Hollywood movie. The ending is entirely pessimistic; the rich and successful Judah discovers the shakiness of the construct of humanity, and God's eye no longer plagues him, much less no longer exists in his mind. Cliff has let love slip away (then again, I think he deserves it, being wholly unoriginal, having his pet projects fail and even plagiarising a declaration of love from James Joyce's Ulysses). At times it feels like two completely separate films that have been combined as per title. But when they come together, and seem to exhibit the opposite reactions that we would normally expect, Levey's message rings true. But I don't think Cliff ever seems to realise it.

His friend, the popular Dennis (John Stockwell) begins to notice personality changes in Arnie, mainly centered around his obsession with his new car, which is called Christine. The new girl in town, Leigh (Alexandra Paul) begins dating Arnie, and also notices the changes. After some local bullies trash the refurbished Fury, it's not long before Christine takes revenge.What is an ostensibly ridiculous story (a killer car, yeah, I know how it sounds) works for two reasons here first, the source novel by King is very well-written; and second, because we have John Carpenter at the helm of the film, steering corner after corner with remarkable finesse. What could have been utter tripe is actually one of the most timeless and well-done horror films of the eighties.I would go so far as to say that Christine may be a technically perfect film, or at least close to it. The film sets itself up as a sort of throwback to the fifties doo-wop culture of early rock'n'roll, drive-ins, and vintage cars, all in spite of the fact that the film is set in 1978. The novel and the film have an equal nostalgia for Americana, something that seems to translate more effectively on screen than it does in literature. Carpenter captures suburbia as effectively as he did in Halloween, though atmospherically, Christine has more in common with a film like Fright Night than it does with the former. The thematic center of the film lies in the car itself, which acts as not just an emblem of American culture, but also as a metaphor as well as an object for projection of Gordon's tortured protagonist.Shots of the small town streets and the ruby-red Fury are aesthetically perfect, and the action scenes are very nicely done. Another element of the film that contributes to its timelessness is the high-brow special effects which still hold up astoundingly well after nearly thirty years. Solid, likable performances from Keith Gordon and John Stockwell up the ante as well, with a young Alexandra Paul supplying the teenage high school crush\/eventual comrade. Character performances from Harry Dean Stanton, Robert Prosky, and Roberts Blossom elevate the film even further. A young Kelly Preston also appears in the film as one of the kids' cheerleader classmates. A pleasant mixture of fifties rock all the way to the Rolling Stones and George Thorogood round out the soundtrack, which acts as a nice varnish on the film.Overall, Christine is a somewhat unsung genre classic. No matter how absurd the story may sound, the execution here makes the film impossible to dismiss; it is highly entertaining, quirky, at times thrilling, and beautifully shot. Sophisticated special effects and the alternate-fifties-high-school universe in which the film takes place maintain the film's timelessness. Fans of small-town American horror and car films alike should find the film to be a real treat. 10\/10.
