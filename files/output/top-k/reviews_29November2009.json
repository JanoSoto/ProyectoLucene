[{"date":"29 November 2009","score":"","review":" Johnny Depp stars as Icabod Crane in a fantastic re imagining of Sleepy hollow. Sleepy hollow is a scary film that doesn't even care if it breaks rules. For instance, children in this film are murdered. Now how often do you see that in a horror film? Not often because Burton isn't like any other film director. He has no horror film rules. He does it the way he wants it. That is the way a lot of directors do it. Sleepy hollow is loosely based on Washington Irving's story. I can't remember the name cause it's very long. Icabod Crane(Played by Johnny Depp) is sent down to the town of Sleepy hollow to investigate a few murders. He soon finds out that there are from a guy named the Headless horseman. It's pretty obvious why they call him that. Soon enough Icabod finds out some shocking facts. Some of the stuff being sexual. Other stuff, well, betrayal.Burton has taken a short classic and turned it into something scary. The film has it's share in blood. Lots and lots of blood. Sleepy hollow is a creative movie. With a lot of twists. I left out a character. Katrina Van Tassel(played by Christina Ricci) is the love interest. There are a lot of other celebs. Like Christopher Walken as the Headless horseman. This film is very creative. Filled with a few unexpected twists involved. I love horror films like this because I am, sure I would run from this guy. If I was getting chased by Scream, I probably wouldn't be too frightened. Tim Burton's Sleepy hollow will frighten you no matter who you are.Sleepy hollow****\/**** ","genre":null},{"date":"29 November 2009","score":"","review":" Johnny Depp stars as Icabod Crane in a fantastic re imagining of Sleepy hollow.
