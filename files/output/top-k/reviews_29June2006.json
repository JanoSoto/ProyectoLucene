[{"date":"29 June 2006","score":"","review":" While this film is visually far superior to the original from 1968, the plot and characters fall far short, due mostly to a poorly written script and some wooden acting. Burton's style is out in full force on this one, and it works very well for the film, but the plot dives into action when it should be focusing on plot & character development. The first third or so of the movie works very well, homaging the original while retaining its own style. Unfortunately, the story falters and the suspense, horror, and sci-fi thrills - which were built up very well - are sacrificed for the sake of big action scenes. The final battle is a complete mass, topped only by the unbelievable, albeit intriguing, ending. The twist defies logic in all its forms, but it's still cool to see. A disappointment, to be sure. Something tells me this would have worked much better as a sci-fi horror\/thriller than an action\/adventure.There are some intriguing concepts at play within the film, mostly dealing with the evolution of the apes and their culture. The fact that they all evolved from the monkeys that the humans took with them is quite an ingenious idea, made even more so by the fact that the apes all worship these simple monkeys. A nice jab at our own religious beliefs when Ari states that their story of creation is nothing more than a fairy tale. The ape culture is interesting because of its apparent similarity to, yet stark difference from, our own - seems to suggest that evolution turns out the same regardless of species. A thought, though - if the apes evolved from the monkeys who rebelled against the humans, then where did the humans on the planet come from? Definitely a plot hole. Still, the overall concept is quite good, marred unnecessarily by the poor storyline.Technically, the film is superb. The makeup, costumes, production design, music and special effects are all top-notch and very cool. The apes look, act, and move like real animals, not just humans in monkey suits. The score, especially during the opening credits, is excellent and quite appropriate for the film. The ape village is very Burtonesque, which suits it well. Some of the early scenes are startling in their dark beauty. Most of the cool shots in this movie are in the first half, save the final scene. The second half goes awry with silly battle scenes and lame attempts at character development. Once again, the script is to blame. The acting is all over the place, ranging from scenery-chewing (Roth) to mediocre (Wahlberg) to downright bad (the blond chick). In general, the apes seem to do a much better job than the humans - not sure why Burton felt the need to make the humans talk in this one; the muteness of humanity in the original is one of the contributing factors to its greatness. The only human that should matter in this film is the lead character - the rest of the humans are just animals to the apes, and if they can talk, it ruins the idea. Still, the film looks beautiful.All in all, this was a great disappointment. A director as visually skilled as Burton, a classic film just itching to be remade, and loads of money for effects? It's too bad the script fell far short - this would have been a modern classic. Still, the first half or so is great to just look at, if you ignore the inane plot and annoying characters. The twist, however cool, is nothing more than a sorry attempt to top the original's ending - but it's not happening. Burton should have just stuck to homaging the original ending, rather than trying to beat it. Maybe have Wahlberg encounter an ape Statue of Liberty - that would have been cool. Overall, a beautiful film marred by a poor script.

Despite the rather soap like connection to Spock, it never stuck me as awkward. Spock is a proud character and a character which embraces all he's fought against who is a blight on his family is unlikely to come up casually.

Romero's zombie movies. The Return of the Living Dead is a terrific comedy-horror film that perfectly balances the two genres and probably has been the most influential film of its kind since its release.The story begins with Freddy (Thom Mathews), a young man on the first day of his first job as an assistant in a warehouse. His uncle Frank (James Karen) is his new boss, and he shows Freddy the warehouse's most bizarre item a forgotten tank of a Government's special gas that can bring the dead back to life as zombies. By an accident, the tank is opened and the beginning of zombie mayhem occurs.The Return of the Living Dead is a perfectly well-written film that never loses steam and remains true to its original premise. O'Bannon makes good use of both genres and keeps an equilibrium where neither the horror nor the comedy are sacrificed for the benefit of the other. The film is also very smart and witty and doesn't rely on cheap tired jokes to be funny. Loosely based on John Russo's book, Dan O'Bannon takes the story to a new level with the added comedy and the political satire and keeps true to the zombie sub-genre.Overall the film has good rhythm, and it has fitting direction. O'Bannon always has been more a writer than a director (so far he has only directed two films), but his work here is really good for a debut. The film has a slick, rebel look that goes hand to hand with the punk characters that are main part of the film. Despite its low-budget, the film has terrific special effects and particularly the make-up, still looks better than most of the modern stuff of more recent films.The cast is superb, and it is one of the highlights of the film. Veterans Clu Gulager, James Karen and Don Calfa make wonders with their characters and demonstrate their experience. Newcomers Thom Mathews, Miguel A. Nuñez and Linnea Quigley shine in their roles as well as the rest of the punk gang, all very effective in their roles. Quigley has an unforgettable scene that launched her career and reinvented the term Scream Queen.The movie suffers from its low-budget, but it is never a noticeable problem (in fact, it adds to the entertainment). O'Bannon may not be a great director, but his proficient script and the great cast definitely make up for any mistake he may had committed. If a real flaw is to be found, it would be the fact that it has dated somewhat badly, although it has gained that nostalgic mystique that surrounds all those 80s horror classics.To summarize, while The Return of the Living Dead is not a perfect comedy\/horror, it is definitely the most influential of all, and still holds up as one of the best horror movies of all time.

There are certain things one has come to expect, even demand of a Bond film and each individual effort either delivers or it doesn't. So, here are ten elements that make a Bond film a Bond film and how THE SPY WHO LOVED ME rates on a scale of 1 to 10Title THE SPY WHO LOVED ME The title seems more appropriate for a Harlequin Romance novel, and if suitable at all for a Bond film, it would have been a better title for ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE. Yet, it does finally work the word spy into the title of a Bond film. 7 points.Pre-Credit Teaser It's all very nicely done Within a few minutes, we see a submarine stolen and its crew kidnapped; we meet the Soviet's top agent, who just happens to be -- surprise! -- a woman; and we get the added treat of one of Bond's greatest stunts, the great skiing-skydiving trick. A pretty cool way to kick off the film and set up the various story lines. 9 points.Opening Credits Arguably the silliest of all of Maurice Binder's efforts, the opening sequence finds 007 bouncing around on a trampoline while various miniature, and apparently naked, babes do gymnastics on the barrels of guns. (Pity he didn't come up with that idea for THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN.) Bordering on self-parody, it is nonetheless naughty and fun and colorful and oh-so very James Bond. 9 points.Theme Song No beating around the bush here, the song gets right to the point Nobody does it half as good as you, Baby, you're the best. Just what Bond is best at is open to interpretation. The music by Marvin Hamlisch is swanky and matched by Carol Bayer Sager's dreamy and only slightly sarcastic lyrics. And Carly Simon's vocals bring it all home. Maybe not the best Bond song, but right up there. 9 points.Bond, James Bond Moore finally makes the role his. The number of smug one-liners have been trimmed, yet he still invests the character with humor -- plus some warmth and charm, and unexpected sadness. And we get to see a bit of Bond's vanity as he matches wits with a female agent who is his equal and not impressed by his stock-and-trade flirtations. Moore's best appearance as Bond. 9 points.Bond Babes The prevailing notion has always been that Bond Girl equals Bimbo, which is only partly true. Most of the women Bond encounters are highly skilled professionals -- as well as being bimbos. But Soviet agent Major Anya Amasova, a.k.a. XXX, is the first Bond Girl to give James a run for his money. She's smart, sexy, capable, resourceful and it takes her almost the whole movie to actually fall in love with Bond. What will power! As played by Barbara Bach (a.k.a., soon-to-be Mrs. Ringo Starr), Anya ranks as one of the best Bond Girls, easily worthy of 9 points.Bond Villain Karl Stromberg (nice villainous name, by the way) is one of those mad billionaires who hopes to create a new world order by mass genocide and building a new society, this time underwater. It is pretty much a cliché character and unfortunately Curt Jurgen plays the part like a grumpy old man and can't seem to muster up even a maniacal laugh. 5 points.Bond Baddies Oddjob look-a-like Sandor, played by Milton Reid, puts in an appearance long enough to die a memorable death, but it is Richard Kiel who steps into the limelight as Jaws, one of the great Bond villains. If being a hulking, seven-foot tall muscle man weren't enough, he also has steel teeth and an amazingly obsessive desire to kill 007. Playing Wile E.

Yet, it does finally work the word spy into the title of a Bond film. 7 points.Pre-Credit Teaser It's all very nicely done Within a few minutes, we see a submarine stolen and its crew kidnapped; we meet the Soviet's top agent, who just happens to be -- surprise! -- a woman; and we get the added treat of one of Bond's greatest stunts, the great skiing-skydiving trick. A pretty cool way to kick off the film and set up the various story lines. 9 points.Opening Credits Arguably the silliest of all of Maurice Binder's efforts, the opening sequence finds 007 bouncing around on a trampoline while various miniature, and apparently naked, babes do gymnastics on the barrels of guns. (Pity he didn't come up with that idea for THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN.) Bordering on self-parody, it is nonetheless naughty and fun and colorful and oh-so very James Bond. 9 points.Theme Song No beating around the bush here, the song gets right to the point Nobody does it half as good as you, Baby, you're the best.

The number of smug one-liners have been trimmed, yet he still invests the character with humor -- plus some warmth and charm, and unexpected sadness. And we get to see a bit of Bond's vanity as he matches wits with a female agent who is his equal and not impressed by his stock-and-trade flirtations. Moore's best appearance as Bond. 9 points.Bond Babes The prevailing notion has always been that Bond Girl equals Bimbo, which is only partly true. Most of the women Bond encounters are highly skilled professionals -- as well as being bimbos. But Soviet agent Major Anya Amasova, a.k.a. XXX, is the first Bond Girl to give James a run for his money. She's smart, sexy, capable, resourceful and it takes her almost the whole movie to actually fall in love with Bond. What will power! As played by Barbara Bach (a.k.a., soon-to-be Mrs. Ringo Starr), Anya ranks as one of the best Bond Girls, easily worthy of 9 points.Bond Villain Karl Stromberg (nice villainous name, by the way) is one of those mad billionaires who hopes to create a new world order by mass genocide and building a new society, this time underwater. It is pretty much a cliché character and unfortunately Curt Jurgen plays the part like a grumpy old man and can't seem to muster up even a maniacal laugh. 5 points.Bond Baddies Oddjob look-a-like Sandor, played by Milton Reid, puts in an appearance long enough to die a memorable death, but it is Richard Kiel who steps into the limelight as Jaws, one of the great Bond villains.

In all, the movie was an effective display of brutality in war, and of some of the nonsense that goes on not only in war, but in the world, that leads to bloodshed. Often what makes a film is great acting from all the minor characters. In this movie, the minor characters outshine the stars in every instance. I think of it more a warning than a spoiler to state that Perlman, whose character the viewer knows will die, is killed almost as soon as he is introduced. People expecting to see more from him should expect to see what amounts to a large cameo instead. However, he does dominate while on screen, and does have the major line of the movie, about the sickle and the hammer. The three Russian leads are drawn with some compassion and humanity, but they don't stir a lot of interest, and the actors playing these roles are the worst at enunciating and expressing their words. You basically have to guess at what they are saying, and that is unforgivable. It is more important to convey the message and characters than to simply speak with thick accents. Indeed, it is Sacha and his mother who dominate the story, although they don't appear that much. And it is the quest of the mother in the end that draws the viewer instead of the quest of the lead character. Gabriel Thomson gives an incredible performance as the tyke, Sacha, and Eva Mattes is downplayed as the mother, but does admirably in her small screen time. The plot is probably one of the weak points here. Its hard to make excitement out of cat and mouse, and the story takes heavy theatrical license. The director makes the mistake of showing whole scale carnage that can't be escaped early in the film, yet tries to persuade the viewer to believe the lead character and the German sniper can only be killed by each other. Of course, younger viewers will appreciate the larger than life characters and accept this, but mature viewers will be puzzled by the directing, which means they're paying more attention to the method than the story, a bad sign for an entertainer. Still, there are more truths than fallacies to the story, and it is enlightening. The directing and film editing look splotched. Sacha, for example, just magically appears in the presence of the German sniper. There are other examples. But the director redeems himself overall. The last sequence involving Ed Harris and Gabriel Thomson is extremely effective.

There is no way that one can walk out of this film without having felt something - the excesses of horror and gore, and the violence shown, such as someone's face being ripped off, or someone's legs being ripped so that only bones remain - are a shock to the senses. Every form of atrophy and mutilation of the human body is shown on screen a visually disturbing comment on how fragile our human bodies are and how poorly we are able to defend ourselves if attacked.Timothy Balme as the protagonist, an introverted weakling, is reminiscent of the protagonist in Peter Weir's 'The Cars that Ate Paris'. As in Weir's film, the protagonist discovers and shows others that he has power even if it does not appear so on the outside. Jackson's film is a black comedy, and part of the comedy comes from how Balme is able to withstand numerous zombie attacks despite being having such a weak personality and physique. The outwardly strong characters are the ones who die in the film, while the supposedly inwardly strong ones survive.Despite the depth of Jackson's film, it ultimately becomes a mess, with repetitive attacks by zombies and blood everywhere. The story seems to halt after a certain point and becomes slaughterhouse galore. There is also a distinct lack of logic in the film. A rare rat is an infectious zombie?

This is a sad under-ranking. This film is not only the greatest movie ever made, it shouldn't have to compete with such films as the Lord of the Rings, which will be forgotten 10 years from now. Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet has painted a timeless classic for the modern era.The plot is simplistic a girl with a vivid imagination sets out to better the lives of those around her, and seeks true love. The twists come in the form of numerous asides, where we see flashes from other people's lives. While these branches and untapped subplots are unrelated, they serve as a reinforcement reminding us of Amelie's healthy imagination.The acting is all wonderful, as the film has a comic element that is very French. I do not know if Americans could have made this. While watching the way the characters interact with each other, I was reminded of my younger days in college, reading Beaumarchais' The Marriage of Figaro. French literature has a rich history of comic genius (from at least the days of Voltaire's Candide if not sooner) and this film translates that energy from page to screen. At the same time, there is a serious existentialist tilt to this how do we, as insignificant people, affect the world? This point is accentuated more by the fact that Amelie stands alone in the world despite being surrounded by so many people -- much like the girl in Renoir's painting (more on this shortly).Audrey Tautou is particularly charming, in an alluringly beautiful way, but also innocently childlike in her grace and style. While more Americans probably know her today as the woman from The DaVinci Code, this will always remain her best film (be that a blessing or a curse). One cannot help but like the character of Amelie -- she quite simply is flawless in her imperfect humanity.The directing? Amazing! Angles, lighting and most of all colors (every color is pushed to the max as if the whole universal was designed by Crayola) are used to make a surreal and inviting world, where even death seems welcome and fun. The few characters who die do not do so in a way that makes us upset or sad, although the timing and manner is most tragic. The greens are the most vibrant, I think... even permeating into the other colors. But rather than blur things with its leaking, it only makes them more fluid and lifelike.And even the subplots are fascinating Amelie toys with a prospective lover, sends a garden gnome on a trip around the world, searches for a mystery man in red shoes, defends a young imbecile, makes unsuspecting patrons fall in love and helps a sheltered painter find the vision of Renoir.The painter (known as Raymond Dufayel or The Glass Man and played by Serge Merlin) is a crucial central character. He is somewhat of a Sisyphean being, trying over and over again to complete the same task without fully succeeding. But he is also a mentor like Socrates (encouraging the youth to stand up against society) and a surrogate father figure. While Amelie has a father, their relationship is very spartan and business-like; her real interaction comes from Dufayel who guides her in metaphors and allusions.This film also manages to do something very difficult -- make the obscene benign. While the film does have a sexual element and some off-color jokes (one pornographic and another about abortion), we never feel the film has an adult quality to it. Everything seems innocent and pure -- even in the middle of the adult toy store. That must be a very difficult thing to capture as I know of no other film which has done so.I will lay my reputation on the line and say this is the most perfect film ever created by human hands.

While watching the way the characters interact with each other, I was reminded of my younger days in college, reading Beaumarchais' The Marriage of Figaro. French literature has a rich history of comic genius (from at least the days of Voltaire's Candide if not sooner) and this film translates that energy from page to screen. At the same time, there is a serious existentialist tilt to this how do we, as insignificant people, affect the world? This point is accentuated more by the fact that Amelie stands alone in the world despite being surrounded by so many people -- much like the girl in Renoir's painting (more on this shortly).Audrey Tautou is particularly charming, in an alluringly beautiful way, but also innocently childlike in her grace and style. While more Americans probably know her today as the woman from The DaVinci Code, this will always remain her best film (be that a blessing or a curse). One cannot help but like the character of Amelie -- she quite simply is flawless in her imperfect humanity.The directing? Amazing! Angles, lighting and most of all colors (every color is pushed to the max as if the whole universal was designed by Crayola) are used to make a surreal and inviting world, where even death seems welcome and fun. The few characters who die do not do so in a way that makes us upset or sad, although the timing and manner is most tragic. The greens are the most vibrant, I think... even permeating into the other colors. But rather than blur things with its leaking, it only makes them more fluid and lifelike.And even the subplots are fascinating Amelie toys with a prospective lover, sends a garden gnome on a trip around the world, searches for a mystery man in red shoes, defends a young imbecile, makes unsuspecting patrons fall in love and helps a sheltered painter find the vision of Renoir.The painter (known as Raymond Dufayel or The Glass Man and played by Serge Merlin) is a crucial central character. He is somewhat of a Sisyphean being, trying over and over again to complete the same task without fully succeeding. But he is also a mentor like Socrates (encouraging the youth to stand up against society) and a surrogate father figure. While Amelie has a father, their relationship is very spartan and business-like; her real interaction comes from Dufayel who guides her in metaphors and allusions.This film also manages to do something very difficult -- make the obscene benign. While the film does have a sexual element and some off-color jokes (one pornographic and another about abortion), we never feel the film has an adult quality to it. Everything seems innocent and pure -- even in the middle of the adult toy store. That must be a very difficult thing to capture as I know of no other film which has done so.I will lay my reputation on the line and say this is the most perfect film ever created by human hands. From beginning to end this film speaks a subtle truth, and shows us that everyone has good points and bad points, flaws and great attributes. I know of no other film that treats its characters as both epic and unbearably human. And this is why Amelie stands out.

Ironic in a way because horror movies are notorious for over-the-top gore and stomach-churning scenes which this film almost has none of such antics.In fact this film is almost like a satire of such gory films, (eg. the scene where Jack wielding a axe looks like he's just about kill his wife until he's interrupted, losing interest and then walks away). This film must have been considered terrifying in 1980 although now, while it still maintains its' eeriness, Jack Nicholson's flamboyant performance may have some laughing.What is unique about this film is that it makes you THINK, rather than presenting the answers to everything in front of you. The beauty of not knowing is what makes this films one of the truly eerie films of all time.The plot sounds basic enough - a recovering alcoholic is hired to be the caretaker of a grand hotel, and takes his traumatized wife and child. Things go smoothly for a while... until Jack sees - or thinks he sees - ghosts of child murderers, naked femme fatales, sinister looking barmen and self-contained waiters. His son is in no better place, who keeps having weird, unsettling hallucinations about the hotel.As the film progresses, Jack quickly becomes obnoxious, lazy, grouchy, intimidating, anti-social and withdrawn. He especially is obnoxious to his wife, Wendy, with whom he can not have a normal, loving relationship with, and acts intimidating towards his son, Danny, while saying he would never harm him or his mother.For those looking for intelligent, well-crafted, solid, neat little horror films, check Stanely Kubrick's classic THE SHINING.

Supposedly the 1980's ushered in the me generation, but after watching this film, one has to wonder if it didn't begin earlier. Lenny Cathrow (Charles Grodin) has got to be one of the most selfish characters on film.He marries a nice enough gal, Lila (Jeannie Berlin, daughter of the director, Elaine May), but almost instantly shows contempt for her - buyer's remorse? On the third day of his honeymoon, he meets a (rich) spoiled college kid, Kelly (Cybill Shepherd), whose beauty and laugh captivate him. I should mention that Lenny and Lila are New York Jews and Kelly is a blonde mid-Westerner from Minneapolis. The fact that Lenny may never have seen a WASP like Kelly while growing up in the city is hardly an excuse for his actions, and Berlin's character is hardly a stereotypical (repugnant, overindulged) Jewish American Princess.Sure, the road-trip to Miami, during which Lenny all-too-quickly grew to hate his bride (one wonders how he ever chose to marry her in the first place), was hardly ideal. But someone who'd spent three years in the service of his country should show a little more maturity than he does; the story recalls Tennessee Williams's play, and the much better film Period of Adjustment (1962) - Jim Hutton's character was also ex-military. Suddenly, anything Lila does (almost nothing Lenny shouldn't have noticed while dating) is distasteful to her groom. Is it possible that he was a virgin and we're to believe that their wedding night sex was too disillusioning for him?So, Lenny decides to dump his newlywed wife to pursue Kelly, whose attraction to him is a mystery; it appears she's only toying with the young bridegroom until the incredible (and disappointing) end when he wins her away from her disapproving father (Eddie Albert, his performance being the film's only highlight). I can enjoy a movie with unredeemable characters, as long as the plot is plausible.

The officer who gets the girl is a complete thug of a police officer with complete disdain for proper police procedures and due process. His method of choice when seeking information and dealing with disappointing situations is to get physical or to abuse and threaten whomever he is dealing with - citizens, his girlfriend or even fellow cops. The film awards him the girl (a high-class hooker) after he established a 'relationship' with her while he was working on a murder case in which she is significantly involved. The other officer who receives the police medals is suppose to be the films moral compass. During the film he speaks up on the transgressions and immorality in the LAPD, but we too find him later making intense physical sexual advances (he actually literally rapes her)at the high-class hooker who has already been sleeping with his thug cop coworker. At the end of the film, Mr Moral Compass then proceeds,in summary judgement style, to kill another officer -unnecessarily shooting him in the back - after the latter cop had been apprehended for murdering other police officers and aligning himself with the local MOB drug trade. This repeated issuance of summary judgments at the barrel of a gun in this film with no retribution is disturbing.Also disturbing is the fact that in this film of 1952 Los Angeles, the only Black faces seen in the entire film are three criminal youths who, after being rounded up and interrogated, admit to the senseless rape of a Mexican girl. With aid from an unverified and false police statement from the rape victim, the three youth then are also charged with conducting the multiple diner murders which are at the heart of the movie's story. After somehow escaping police custody, the three youths are later summarily gunned down in a violent police raid at their residence. A fourth unnamed older black man is found watching TV in one of the rooms in the house where the rape occurred, but he is for no reason summarily murdered by the thug cop before he is even questioned on the extent of his involvement. Of course, there is no accountability for this murder, as the officer is later seen riding off in the sunset with the pretty girl at movies end.Sure its only a movie, and after all, 'LA Confidential' is all about corruption and vice rampant in the LAPD during this period. However, no classic presents all these inexplicable, incongruous and unresolved issues without even attempting to address them. The oversight is too obvious.

The second remake of the Japanese film Yojimbo from legendary Japanese director Akira Kurosawa, which was initially remade as A Fistful of Dollars starring Clint Eastwood, Last Man Standing is set in a dusty, windswept Texas city right out of a Hollywood western, yet the characters are all dressed in attire from the 1920's and carry tommy guns. It's is an unusual visual dichotomy that proves to be about the most engaging thing in Last Man Standing, a film that seems to be almost pointless, lacking any real reason to exist other than to watch characters blow other characters away.John Smith (Bruce Willis) is a loner making his way through the Texas desert and stops off at the city of Jericho. Jericho is controlled by two mobster gangs, one Italian, one Irish. The two are using Jericho to funnel illegal booze from the Mexican border during prohibition. The town is more or less uninhabited, save for the gang members, the saloon keeper (Tracey Walter) and the undertaker (The saloon keeper says in one scene Business isn't too good these days. So . . . why are you staying in this city?). John Smith finds himself stranded in the city when he looks at the Irish mobster boss' woman in bondage, Felina (Karina Lombard) and the Irish mobsters politely inform him that he shouldn't be doing that and promptly render his car unusable (He better not take her back to Chicago, they will have to wreck a lot of cars).John quickly decides he can use this situation to his advantage to make money and presents himself to the Italian boss, Fredo Strozzi (Ned Eisenberg), who likes Smith, but his cousin Giorgio (Michael Imperioli, before he switched families and joined The Sopranos) doesn't trust him. Eventually, Smith manages to take a similar tack with Irish boss Doyle (David Patrick Kelley), but Smith's motives are questioned by Doyle's right hand man, the sadistic Hickey (Christopher Walken) (Apparently, henchmen don't like being muscled out by other henchmen). This all eventually leads to a whole lot of death and carnage, not to mention bad feelings on both sides.Director Walter Hill has been in a Western mode for several years, having made Geronimo, Wild Bill, the pilot for HBO's Deadwood and an upcoming AMC miniseries set in the old west, and it's obvious that he is applying that same motif where he can in Last Man Standing. But since A Fistful of Dollars had already made Yojimbo into a straight western (and Yojimbo itself was an homage to American western films), Hill has to settle for an almost western. Aside from the look of the film, what the audience is treated to in Last Man Standing is a lot of posturing, a lot of gunplay and not much else. Hill seems to like these kinds of movies where tough guys act tough, and you don't get much tougher than blowing people away at the drop of a hat.Aside from it's violence, Last Man Standing doesn't really offer anything to the viewer. There isn't any romance (as with most other Hill films, Last Man Standing is not exactly female friendly), although Smith does show his softer side on occasion, there isn't any intrigue, and even though effectively played by Willis, Smith fails to be a very compelling character to put any stock in. Aside from Willis, Imperioli and Kelley overact a bit too much, Eisenberg is okay, and Walken manages to make Hickey a despicable character, but since Smith isn't exactly our idea of a hero, can we really work up an dislike for Hickey (It doesn't help that he is movie insane, shooting wildly at walls and throwing things around with abandon. Who really does this?).So, Last Man Standing, while attractively photographed and with a nice, solid performance by Willis, is still a big So? Not how I envision spending two hours of my life.

Basically 'Joliet' Jake Blues (John Belushi) has just been released from prison, and he and his brother Elwood Blues (Dan Aykroyd, also writing) return to the orphanage run by nuns where they were raised as children. They find out that the church has stopped giving support to the orphanage and that unless they can pay the $5000 tax on the property it will be sold, so they go the church for some inspiration. Jake sees the light and suggests that he and Elwood should reunite their old blues band and raise the money by selling out all seats in an arena gig. So they set off on their mission from God to find their fellow band members to join them, and they don't care what it takes, they won't even stop for the police or any old enemies. One by one Jake and Elwood do find the members of the band, while being chased by the cops, an army of Nazis and an enraged Mystery Woman (Carrie Fisher), and of course having a few song and dance scenes with old friends. After all are reunited, and playing a small gig under a false identity to warm up, they are ready for their big concert where they do indeed manage to sell all seats, and they play with great reaction, and manage to get away from the cops in the audience. The final scene sees Jake and Elwood speeding to the tax office with the £5000 to pay for the orphanage, and they do manage to do this before being arrested for all the damage and chaos they caused in their journey. Also starring Kathleen Freeman as Sister Mary 'The Penguin' Stigmata, James Brown as Reverend Cleophus James, Cab Calloway as Curtis, Ray Charles as Ray, Aretha Franklin as Mrs. Murphy, John Candy as Burton Mercer, Escape to Witch Mountain's Henry Gibson as Head Nazi, Steve Lawrence as Maury Sline, Charles Napier as Tucker McElroy, young Steven Spielberg as Cook County Assessor's Office Clerk, Twiggy as Chic Lady, Pee-wee's Big Adventure's Paul Reubens as Waiter, Frank Oz as Corrections Officer, Landis himself as Trooper La Fong, John Lee Hooker as Street Slim, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air's James Avery as Man dancing outside Ray's shop and Mr. T as Guy on Street. Belushi and Aykroyd are fantastic as the criminally minded but ultimately likable brothers, the cameo appearances by legends of music and film makes for fun viewing, the plot is simple and there are a fair amount of laughable moments (including possibly unintentional), and of course the song and dance sequences, including the memorable Everybody Needs Somebody To Love, are great fun, a most watchable musical comedy. It was number 24 on The 100 Greatest Musicals, and it was number 12 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films. Very good!

Belushi and Aykroyd are fantastic as the criminally minded but ultimately likable brothers, the cameo appearances by legends of music and film makes for fun viewing, the plot is simple and there are a fair amount of laughable moments (including possibly unintentional), and of course the song and dance sequences, including the memorable Everybody Needs Somebody To Love, are great fun, a most watchable musical comedy. It was number 24 on The 100 Greatest Musicals, and it was number 12 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films. Very good!

Basically 'Joliet' Jake Blues (John Belushi) has just been released from prison, and he and his brother Elwood Blues (Dan Aykroyd, also writing) return to the orphanage run by nuns where they were raised as children. They find out that the church has stopped giving support to the orphanage and that unless they can pay the $5000 tax on the property it will be sold, so they go the church for some inspiration. Jake sees the light and suggests that he and Elwood should reunite their old blues band and raise the money by selling out all seats in an arena gig. So they set off on their mission from God to find their fellow band members to join them, and they don't care what it takes, they won't even stop for the police or any old enemies. One by one Jake and Elwood do find the members of the band, while being chased by the cops, an army of Nazis and an enraged Mystery Woman (Carrie Fisher), and of course having a few song and dance scenes with old friends. After all are reunited, and playing a small gig under a false identity to warm up, they are ready for their big concert where they do indeed manage to sell all seats, and they play with great reaction, and manage to get away from the cops in the audience. The final scene sees Jake and Elwood speeding to the tax office with the £5000 to pay for the orphanage, and they do manage to do this before being arrested for all the damage and chaos they caused in their journey.

Superman II is often times considered to be an improvement over the first one and while this is certainly a great movie to watch, I personally prefer Superman #1 due to it's sense of wonder and good natured drive. That is not to say that Superman II doesn't always equal the greatness of # 1, for instance the romance between Lois Lane(Margot Kidder) and Clark Kent\/Superman(Christopher Reeve) provides unexpected texture to the climatic proceedings, even if it is somewhat of a letdown by what happens at the end. The villains are well played and the ice palace is great. Although the character of Lex Luther is a big distraction, especially since he's hardly the threat that the three super villains are.

Geena Davis stars as Samantha Caine, school teacher and mother of a young daughter. But she has a big issue -- she cannot remember her past before 8 years earlier. While she has a relatively happy life, with her daughter and a very nice boyfriend, she still wants to know her past. She even hires detectives here and there to help her figure it out.Enter Samuel L. Jackson as Mitch Henessey, one of those low priced detectives. Also a scam artist, Mitch has spent his time in jail, thanks to a theft of some drugs, later found in his place.There is quite a bit of violence and 'blue' language, but get past that and you have a very funny movie that tries not to take itself too seriously. Davis and Jackson are very good together. My wife used to make fun of me for thinking that line in the old song went I'm not talking about the linen, and we both laughed when Jackson said the very same words while singing along in the car. Davis told him, 'That song isn't about linen!' That kind of goofy humor all through the movie made it enjoyable.Spoilers Follow. Davis' character really was Charlene 'Charly' Baltimore, a highly trained assassin, working for the US government, but who was thought to have been killed 8 years earlier. When she is seen on TV news in a parade as a female Santa, everyone begins to hunt her down, as she slowly begins to realize who she was, and that she must have had some really good martial arts training some time in her past. As this kind of movie would have it, Mitch and 'Charley', against all odds, prevail and kill all the bad guys.

The 1996 version of Emma is up there with the 2005 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. I have enjoyed this movie for years. If you are an Austen fan, you already know the story of a matchmaking woman and her society friends in the Victorian era. The casting of Gwyneth Paltrow as Emma and Jeremy Northam and Mr. Knightley is charming and well fitted to the story; while Toni Colette as Harriett is genius. Ewan MacGregor and Alan Cumming round out the cast with memorable performances as Frank Weston and Mr. Elton. Douglas McGrath does an outstanding job capturing story, setting, and era. I would rather watch this original version of the story than the modern day retelling titled Clueless anyday.The DVD is somewhat lackluster, only offering the theatrical trailer as the lone special feature. I would have liked a commentary or two, possibly some interviews with cast and director. Some additional documentary information regarding the novel and author would have also been a fun addition. The movie was charming and would be served better with some equally entertaining special features.
