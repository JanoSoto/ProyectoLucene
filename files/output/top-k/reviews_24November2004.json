Maybe that's why I found it to be decent at best... maybe I should have seen some other Spike Lee films first, to get used to his style. Or maybe I shouldn't have expected Milla to have a big or important role(because she certainly didn't seem to have that here). Actually, I believe one could edit out all of her scenes without actually taking anything important away from the plot... without having an impact on any aspect of the movie, apart from its length. Of course, I'm not unhappy Milla had a role in the movie(if she hadn't had one, I probably wouldn't have seen the movie at all)... I'm just a little disappointed that her role was so empty and seemingly pointless. The plot is OK, but nothing too impressive... maybe it's my lack of understanding of black culture, but I really don't get the whole hysteria surrounding basketball. And this, lets not beat around the bush, is a movie about basketball. Concordantly, I don't see what the big deal is. The pacing is bad... but then again, maybe it's just that I'm not used to Lee as a director. But I was bored most of the time. Some of the dialog is OK, a little of it is even halfway good... but most of it isn't. The characters are well-written but not always credible. The acting is OK... Denzel turns in a great performance, as usual. Apart from him, though, the only impressive actor in the lot was Milla Jovovich. She portrayed her character really well. The lead playing opposite Denzel was a poor actor... I know that he's a basketball player in real life, but couldn't they at the very least have done about his acting skills, or replaced him with an actual actor? He did a terrible job of carrying half of the movie on his shoulders... had it not been for Denzel, I wouldn't have been able to watch any of it, I think(apart from Milla's scenes). You want to see a good something-other-than-actor-turned-actor giving a great first-time performance? See 8 Mile. Check out Eminem. Now that's acting. The film as a whole just isn't interesting enough, I think, and has far too few worthwhile moments to make it worth sitting through. The only redeeming factor of the movie is, you guessed it, Milla Jovovich. I bought the film(low-price, don't worry... I'm not a complete idiot) because she's in it, I saw it(well... some of it... didn't manage to pay attention for the whole thing) because she's in it, and what I liked of it(which was very little) was because she's in it. I don't know... maybe Spike Lee is just one of those directors\/writers that you have to get used to before you can really enjoy their work. I recommend this to fans of Denzel Washington and Milla Jovovich.

Boy, was I surprised. Not only is the dog trying to find his family, he's out for revenge against the man who put him in the situation in the first place. Full of mature themes and gripping moments, this is one of those rare movies that will definitely make you think and- as stated by everyone else here- shed a few tears.We follow Fluke from puppyhood to adulthood as he starts trying desperately to find out who he once was. After putting 2 and 2 together, Fluke does indeed set out on a journey to find his wife and son, much to the dismay of his ill-fated friend Rumbo, a dog who was also human. When Fluke finds them, he's living the good life- that is, until his crooked business partner comes in and crashes the party. Fluke is determined to make sure he won't do any harm to his family as he did to him. But is Fluke going by truth, or what he wants to believe?... The main thing about this movie that hit me at first was the music. The beautiful orchestra soundtrack accompanied this film perfectly. There were a few times I watched the credits simply to hear the music. And of course, what's good music without good filmography to go with it? This movie has that too. Some of the most bright, natural filming can be seen with the dog as he braves mountains and rivers on his long journey, or during the more peaceful moments as he plays with his family out in the sunshine. All in all, the filming and soundtrack itself is definitely a step up from a few of the more well-known animal movies, like Homeward Bound for instance.The story itself is very unpredictable, another thing I was not expecting from a movie such as this. Fluke's acts and visions will keep you watching to find out the real story behind his past. But while he's fending away his partner, he's trying to convince his family that he's more than just some old dog. Many of these scenes had me stop the movie just to pull myself together, such as when he did his fatherly duties of tucking his son in and laying on his side of the bed during the night. Acting in the movie ranges from good to alright. It's not the best acting in the world, but the humans weren't the ones I paid attention to and even then, the dogs still had the best lines and voicing, despite the fact that they talked only for a short while. The little boy had to be the most irritating of all though, especially in scenes when he was distressed in any way. I also feel the lab scene could have been executed a bit better. That scene seemed to pass by too quickly or just put in the middle of the movie with no purpose, but it did help explain a major event, so I can't complain.In conclusion Fluke is a timeless gem and a very impressive attempt at a family drama from such an unknown director. The filmography, score, and plot itself made this movie one of best animal-oriented movies of the last century. Only the acting from the humans and a few of the sometimes out-of-place scenes hurt the movie just a tad, but not enough to stop me from giving this underrated movie the recommendation it truly deserves.

I suppose he must've hired everyone in Hollywood to do this picture. Do you think everyone had a piece? Piece of what you may ask. A piece of a failure of monumental proportions. This movie reminded me of the Titanic - the boat, not the movie.Why is this movie a failure? This film suffers from terrible dramatic fundamentals. It is a classic example of the movie drives the plot which is not the way it works. Rather, good drama has as its one trademark, the plot drives the movie. Any first year director in any dramatic medium should know this. You do the scenes so that the plot is revealed, not rewritten. The reader is kept on edge, waiting to see what happens next.And that is the key. The following notes on the characters are inconsequential. This movie suffers most from appalling writing that undermines everything. Nice dialogue does nothing if the storyline makes no sense. Who cares? In this film, the reader is constantly wondering, 'what just happened there.' Did I miss something? What are they talking about? Do I need to remember all these characters? No, you don't, Francis just wanted to get his cousin in the picture, so he's wasting your time to do it.That is why the first film, despite its relatively meager budget was a success. Coppola was forced to quell his massive ego and improvise to make it work. He was sloppy and sometimes almost juvenile, but it didn't matter. The plot was so good, all he really had to do is show up. And he almost blew that. Here you see the true Coppola at his ultimate worse. Now you know why the producers of the first film were so worried.All I could think about during the entire film was, 'Where is Brando?'Bobby Deniro and the Italian language were annoying. Deniro was annoying, in general. All I could think about was, okay, so deniro wants to join the gang...of misfits. Pacino was lost. I started muting his outbursts because they were so predictable. The key to a good outburst is it has to be explosive meaning unpredictable. In Al's case it was just load and annoying. I yawned. The rest of the film focused on Pacino's facial movements from the restaurant scene in the first film. It was like Okay Al, remember that restaurant scene? Let's have you do those facial expressions again, for three whole hours. Do you think we'll get tired of it? Diane Keaton shouldn't have even been there. The stupid and pitiful moral struggles of family life made me wonder if Coppolla didn't spend his entire childhood watching the Brady bunch. What a load!!!!!! I can't believe he even attempted to address such things. Does he think I'm some kind of idiot? Obviously. But Daddy doesn't spend enough time with me. Don't worry boy, he's in Cuba. I'll buy you a red toy car. let's go fishing. I vomit.The first half introduced so many utterly inconsequential characters, I couldn't help but wonder if they were all Coppolla's cousins. I've never seen so many gala affairs and parties in one film. I thought I was reading a travel brochure. Coppolla had so overextended himself that at some point he was probably no longer even part of the film. I don't care how many hours he worked. All he did was serve the interests of his own ego. The artist was left helpless in a pile of rubble. It was a managerial catastrophe.This movie was nothing more than a hackneyed soap opera overblown on a proportion that boggles the mind. Great sets, great music, great cameras, do nothing whatsoever if there is no storyline and the characters are uninteresting. ugh. I couldn't help but think that anyone who actually was a mobster would look at this and say, 'what a load of crap.'Fortunately, you don't have to be a mobster to understand that you are being sold a bill of goods. All you have to do is read this. Oh, and for those who actually liked this film...I'll bet you liked Rocky II.Don't waste your time.

Coppola was forced to quell his massive ego and improvise to make it work. He was sloppy and sometimes almost juvenile, but it didn't matter. The plot was so good, all he really had to do is show up. And he almost blew that. Here you see the true Coppola at his ultimate worse. Now you know why the producers of the first film were so worried.All I could think about during the entire film was, 'Where is Brando?'Bobby Deniro and the Italian language were annoying. Deniro was annoying, in general. All I could think about was, okay, so deniro wants to join the gang...of misfits. Pacino was lost. I started muting his outbursts because they were so predictable. The key to a good outburst is it has to be explosive meaning unpredictable. In Al's case it was just load and annoying. I yawned. The rest of the film focused on Pacino's facial movements from the restaurant scene in the first film. It was like Okay Al, remember that restaurant scene? Let's have you do those facial expressions again, for three whole hours. Do you think we'll get tired of it? Diane Keaton shouldn't have even been there. The stupid and pitiful moral struggles of family life made me wonder if Coppolla didn't spend his entire childhood watching the Brady bunch. What a load!!!!!! I can't believe he even attempted to address such things. Does he think I'm some kind of idiot? Obviously. But Daddy doesn't spend enough time with me. Don't worry boy, he's in Cuba. I'll buy you a red toy car. let's go fishing. I vomit.The first half introduced so many utterly inconsequential characters, I couldn't help but wonder if they were all Coppolla's cousins. I've never seen so many gala affairs and parties in one film. I thought I was reading a travel brochure. Coppolla had so overextended himself that at some point he was probably no longer even part of the film. I don't care how many hours he worked. All he did was serve the interests of his own ego. The artist was left helpless in a pile of rubble. It was a managerial catastrophe.This movie was nothing more than a hackneyed soap opera overblown on a proportion that boggles the mind. Great sets, great music, great cameras, do nothing whatsoever if there is no storyline and the characters are uninteresting. ugh. I couldn't help but think that anyone who actually was a mobster would look at this and say, 'what a load of crap.'Fortunately, you don't have to be a mobster to understand that you are being sold a bill of goods.

I suppose he must've hired everyone in Hollywood to do this picture. Do you think everyone had a piece? Piece of what you may ask. A piece of a failure of monumental proportions. This movie reminded me of the Titanic - the boat, not the movie.Why is this movie a failure? This film suffers from terrible dramatic fundamentals. It is a classic example of the movie drives the plot which is not the way it works. Rather, good drama has as its one trademark, the plot drives the movie. Any first year director in any dramatic medium should know this. You do the scenes so that the plot is revealed, not rewritten. The reader is kept on edge, waiting to see what happens next.And that is the key. The following notes on the characters are inconsequential. This movie suffers most from appalling writing that undermines everything. Nice dialogue does nothing if the storyline makes no sense. Who cares? In this film, the reader is constantly wondering, 'what just happened there.' Did I miss something? What are they talking about? Do I need to remember all these characters?

William Smith as always is the king of Tough guys, but I feel wasn't used enough in this movie. John Milius of course is the man and directs another great film that will be remembered for an interesting take on the cold war. Fans of Rambo should love this.

I know, those people might like action which has hardly any theme at all so you don't have to think, and I agree that there are indeed movies that seem to be deep but are just stupid, or at least to me, but I disagree very much that 2001 A space odyssey is one of those movies, because it does have a meaning, and it is clearly shown at the end.Space Odyssey portrays what makes us human and the fact that we are not perfect. When the man and the ship are taken to the infinite and beyond that isn't what happens in reality in the movie, instead it shows the man in a room, looking at his future self, eating, who then looks at his future self in a bed, dying, and finally becomes an embryo that he was decades ago before being born. This is to show how insignificant life is and that it literally has no meaning except for the people living it which don't even know why they're living it, except for that huge slab of rock. Nobody knows what it is, it's just there, and it just makes everybody wonder and they are curious, because the object is very mysterious and there isn't really any solid explanation as to what it is or what it does save for that it was made some million years ago, and deliberately buried on the Moon.The questions are, why is it there?, what does it do?, what is it for?, who made it? where are they now? was it deliberately put there? Or was it just a fluke?All these questions make the viewer as well as the characters wonder, just like the apes in the beginning. They were apes, uncivilized, brutal (who beat each other up) apes, yet when they saw that stone they marveled.If you also happen to remember, the man eating dropped the glass on the floor which shattered. Did the man want it to fall and break? He liked the drink from his expression when he took a sip, so he would have rather it not fall, but yet it did. This shows the man isn't perfect. Had it been Hal, the glass surely wouldn't have fallen, because he is perfect. What happened to Hal? He got shut down. Do you remember the way Hal was begging for his life? What life, he is a machine, you say, but even if he were human, would Hal really have anything to live for? What for, he already knows everything, what does he need to live for? He doesn't, so why did he beg for his life like that, when he knew that it was coming to an end?Ladies and gentlemen, if you think that this movie was about aliens, then you shouldn't be reading this, because this movie was about why we are human and what makes us human. The fact that we marvel, and don't know everything. The fact that we have something to live for, because we don't know what's going to happen the next day. Have you ever seen the movie Groundhog Day?

I'm blessed with a gift to appreciate them, I guess. And I'm also blessed with the ability to take movies as totally separate from their book counterparts. Die hard Ann Rice fans might not like this movie because it slams two books (The Vampire Lestat and The Queen of the Damned) into one to make a relatively short film. So, obviously, a lot of the story was changed or left out. Which makes it understandable why some were upset. I mean, come on, Interview With the Vampire was over two hours long, and it was the movie version of just one book.However, taken as it's own story, the movie is actually very good. Well, in my opinion. Stuart Townsend's portrayal of Lestat is wonderful. And it doesn't hurt that he takes off his shirt quite a bit (he has a really nice, defined, if lean, body) and wears leather pants quite a bit. He also has the rock star quality that is often missing when most actors play musicians. You can see how into the music he is. He also is able to project Lestat's arrogance and loneliness very well.Vincent Perez, who plays Marius, also does a wonderful job. Though quite popular in Europe, he is sadly under-appreciated in the U.S. I can't honestly say that his portrayal was dead on (so to speak) because I haven't read any of the books the character appears in, but I thought he was quite good. (Another one that is good-looking, ladies.)Akasha, unfortunately, displays very few emotions, so Aaliyah didn't get a chance to really showcase her acting talents in her final performance, but she did play the evil vampire convincingly.

It is really more than enough to make it highly enjoyable. Fiddler on the roof takes place in Anatevka©¥a small Jewish village in Russia. It centers around a dairyman©¥Tevya and his five daughters. As a Jew, Tevya attempts to preserve his family¡¯s traditions in the face of a changing world. And he must do hard work everyday without any comfort from his wife. Meanwhile, Tevya must choose between his own daughters¡¯ happiness and those beloved traditions that keep the outside world at bay. Tevya is real a good tolerant father. When he and his neighbors are forced to leave their homes by the subordinates of Czar, the traditional Tevya is aware that he must change his original living idea in face of new condition.Of course, the name of the movie is very significant when I meet it firstly.

","genre":"Crime, Thriller"},{"date":"24 November 2004","score":"18 out of 24 people found the following review useful","review":" What is notable about PHANTASM II, is how the sequel takes a much different route than the first film. Coscarelli rather than recycling the plot of the first, instead adds a new flavour to help keep the sequel not only fresher, but also makes the film a Action\/Horror road movie, rather than a surreal like Horror\/Drama that the original was. When watching the film, it becomes readily apparent that the film is much higher budgeted than what Coscarelli had to work on the original film. Unlike what most film-makers would do, when working on a bigger budgeted sequel to a film of theirs, Coscarelli doesn't waste money on familiar actors, but rather sticks to casting no name, fresh faced actors in the film & spends his money more wisely on special effects & stunts & it really shows here. For starters we get a good look at the Lurkers ghoulish looking faces, zombie make-up, a mutated monster erupting from a girls back & there's a car chase. A decent car & house explosion, a chainsaw duel, better special effects & visual effects, including a gold sphere that can shoot out a laser beam that can blow up anything that moves, a drill like device that can erupt from it & this time there are three spheres! a much better done heat seeking Silver Sphere POV & an incredible melting man effect & a silver sphere burrowing under a Pallbearers spine, through his stomach & up through his throat, before getting stuck in his mouth! The set design for the mausoleums & the deserted, decaying towns & cemeteries are very well done & the fourbarrelled shot gun, chainsaws & home made flame thrower weapons the hero's use are pretty awesome. Coscarelli also adds some Gothic, Hammer horrorish elements, mainly from two deathly pale pallbearers who are assisting the Tall Man in his evil quests, & Gas masked Grave Diggers. The acting is better than the first & Coscarelli again does very good behind the camera. However it's also clear when watching the film, that Coscarelli did not have as much control over this film as he did the first one, which he raised the money for himself. PHANTASM II remains the only studio backed entry to the series & as a result one can well see the studio's fingerprints all over it. For one, Mike is played by then newcomer JAMES LeGROS, who actually performs quiet well as Mike, but it just doesn't feel like a real PHANTASM movie without A. MICHAEL BALDWIN playing the role, he's really missing here & it shows. Minus REGGIE BANNISTER (who also had to audition for his role in order to keep it) & ANGUS SCRIMM & Director Coscarelli, none of the crew of the first returned here. The film has also lost it's surreal like dream quality look & feel that the original had, for a more linear approach. Also gone is the psychological undertones of the first & the mystery surrounding the Tall Man & the Dwarfs are kept as ambiguous as ever. The gore scenes also disappoint, since most of the gore footage wound up on Universal Studio's cutting room floor. PHANTASM II is virtually bloodless, minus a quick cut shot of a sliced off ear & brief blink & you'll miss them shots, of brains being drilled out via the flying spheres & shot out back of it & the puddle of blood on the floor, before said victim collapses. The gore is very watered down & we also get to see a badly charred burned hand, very briefly pass a small porthole window, on a crematorium, that one of the Pallbearer's was tossed into & Reggie thrusts a chainsaw into a gravediggers groin (off screen), a severed hand etc. It also adds a voice over narration from both Liz, Mike & Reggie. The film also introduces not one but two teen psychic characters, Mike & another girl named LIZ (PAULA IRVINE) the two eventually meet & strike up a relationship in a somewhat out of place teen love angle, that I felt again was not only out of place, but also didn't really gel well in the films story. If you were to take it out you would still have a movie, thankfully Coscarelli doesn't care for it either & doesn't spend to much time with it. There are some slow spots to be had, the introduction to Liz kind of slows down the picture. ANGUS SCRIMM seems to be having ball playing the Tall Man & plays the role with such sadistic glee, he really is a fun villain & deserves more recognition within the horror community, than what he has gotten over the years. All in all, PHANTASM II is pretty fast moving & highly enjoyable. Some people tend to prefer this over the original. To be honest I can't say I am one of them, since I prefer the original films eeriness & surreal dream like qualities to straight laced action\/horror which this film is. Love the Hemicuda the hero's travel in. Look for LETHAL WEAPON'S own, KENNETH TIGAR as a priest who knows what is going on & attempts to stop the terror & a ROBOCOP tribute where we see Alex Murphy's headstone in the cemetery, but his body has went missing, since the Tall Man has had it dug up in order to shrink it to the size of a dwarf!. Love the scene where SAM (SPIDER-MAN\/EVIL DEAD) RAIMI'S ashes are being put in a bag, by one for the morgue attendants. The down beat ending is utterly silly & just a re-staging of the first films closing shot, but is original & not done often (the bad guys win & the hero's wind up dying).

And so I had a little trouble understanding, when I told my father that he might have enjoyed it if only he'd come with us, why my mother gave him a weary nod and told him maybe he didn't need to rush to the theater. Well, I just finished watching Bedknobs and Broomsticks again, 33 years later, and I think I know now how my mother felt. It was only out of a sense of duty that I stuck through it to the end. My two children were watching.If you're above the age of twelve or so, there must be a better way to spend your time. Bedknobs and Broomsticks is a perfect example of everything that went wrong at the Disney studio in the late sixties and the early seventies, an incompetent piece of movie-making that seems to have been shot from a first draft of the script, before anyone had a chance to think about it. Some people seem to think that the problem is the Disney restoration -- the 139 minute version now available on DVD. This restoration adds 22 grueling minutes to the running time of the theatrical version. I have to think that it must have been excruciating to adults even in its shorter incarnation. It seemed to me that the movie could have been cut to half its length, and nothing would have been missed. Though no amount of cutting could have made it a good movie.The problem isn't just that the musical numbers seem to go on forever, though they do, especially the restored Portobello Road sequence. The problem is that the story really doesn't hang together, and the characters are poorly drawn. In the amount of time that David Tomlinson spends on screen, we might have gotten a deeper look at a man whose life really has had no meaning, and for whom the con provides the only thrill. (His opening musical number provides a hint of that idea, without really presenting it in a coherent way.) We might have gotten a sense of Angela Lansbury's loneliness, and the desire that led her to enroll in a correspondence course in witchcraft. These are the sorts of ideas that can be conveyed by a line or two, an odd facial expression -- in other words, the sort of subtext we expect a competent movie to deliver. But here there's not even a hint.The cartoon sequence halfway through the movie is utterly no fun whatever, and ultimately it makes no difference to the plot. A mystery is solved during the first 90 minutes or so of the movie, but this problem-solving element of the story is presented without any sense of mystery, and the solution arrives so perfunctorily that it makes the viewer think the last 60 minutes or so have been a waste.I'm not saying this is the worst of Disney's late-sixties, early-seventies product. When I was a kid, I never did get around to seeing The Boatniks or Superdad, not that I plan to seek out the opportunity at this late date. But I did see most, if not all of the rest of Disney's output during that period, and I can definitely say this one approaches the Pete's Dragon standard of wretchedness, without quite surpassing it. It definitely provides spirited competition for The Black Hole.The movie might be worth watching, I suppose, as an example of the depths to which the Disney studio sank in the fifteen years or so after Uncle Walt died. But remember -- the 139 minutes you spend with this movie are 139 minutes you'll never get back.

But I did see most, if not all of the rest of Disney's output during that period, and I can definitely say this one approaches the Pete's Dragon standard of wretchedness, without quite surpassing it. It definitely provides spirited competition for The Black Hole.The movie might be worth watching, I suppose, as an example of the depths to which the Disney studio sank in the fifteen years or so after Uncle Walt died.

And so I had a little trouble understanding, when I told my father that he might have enjoyed it if only he'd come with us, why my mother gave him a weary nod and told him maybe he didn't need to rush to the theater. Well, I just finished watching Bedknobs and Broomsticks again, 33 years later, and I think I know now how my mother felt. It was only out of a sense of duty that I stuck through it to the end. My two children were watching.If you're above the age of twelve or so, there must be a better way to spend your time. Bedknobs and Broomsticks is a perfect example of everything that went wrong at the Disney studio in the late sixties and the early seventies, an incompetent piece of movie-making that seems to have been shot from a first draft of the script, before anyone had a chance to think about it. Some people seem to think that the problem is the Disney restoration -- the 139 minute version now available on DVD. This restoration adds 22 grueling minutes to the running time of the theatrical version. I have to think that it must have been excruciating to adults even in its shorter incarnation. It seemed to me that the movie could have been cut to half its length, and nothing would have been missed. Though no amount of cutting could have made it a good movie.The problem isn't just that the musical numbers seem to go on forever, though they do, especially the restored Portobello Road sequence. The problem is that the story really doesn't hang together, and the characters are poorly drawn. In the amount of time that David Tomlinson spends on screen, we might have gotten a deeper look at a man whose life really has had no meaning, and for whom the con provides the only thrill. (His opening musical number provides a hint of that idea, without really presenting it in a coherent way.) We might have gotten a sense of Angela Lansbury's loneliness, and the desire that led her to enroll in a correspondence course in witchcraft. These are the sorts of ideas that can be conveyed by a line or two, an odd facial expression -- in other words, the sort of subtext we expect a competent movie to deliver. But here there's not even a hint.The cartoon sequence halfway through the movie is utterly no fun whatever, and ultimately it makes no difference to the plot. A mystery is solved during the first 90 minutes or so of the movie, but this problem-solving element of the story is presented without any sense of mystery, and the solution arrives so perfunctorily that it makes the viewer think the last 60 minutes or so have been a waste.I'm not saying this is the worst of Disney's late-sixties, early-seventies product.

But came away with a feeling of, well, not quite satisfaction, but definitely not discomfort as the haters (aka Internet movie nerds and critics) bring forth in their reviews. Sure there is action, explosions, chases, hot chicks, etc. but that's to be expected from a film called The Fast and the Furious. Indeed, it is fast with its MTV style editing with furious undertones of rage and violence and crime, but hey, it's a movie about criminal car racers for crying out loud.Yes the visuals are impressive and the sound is good too. The editing, lighting, cinematography and all the other technicals are well done. The acting...not so well done but not awful - there really isn't a whole lot, nor dialogue for that matter. But what makes the story compelling is its (simple yes, but intriguing nevertheless) character relationships which form the plot.Is this film over the top? Yes. But it is done in such a way that keeps you interested, and besides, since so few of us actually do know about the undercover world of streetcar racing, who are we to say what is real and what isn't? Besides, if you haven't been paying attention, this film is a male fantasy - muscles, guns, money, cars, women...like every other video on MTV (which explains the annoying soundtrack).This film is not a great movie, but it has no pretense of being one, and that is refreshing when so much crap out there does. It is a popcorn flick, instantly forgettable but watchable over and over nonetheless. Plus, watch the DVD extras as to how some impressive stunts were done, and your appreciation for this film will grow.OVERALL RATING 6 of 10 stars.

Followed by two sequels starting with, SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE 2PROLOX TRIVIAScenes from this film were also used as back story & spoofed in Jim Wynorski's fun & funny SORORITY HOUSE MASSACRE 2.***1\/2 stars ","genre":"Comedy, Horror"},{"date":"24 November 2004","score":"15 out of 34 people found the following review useful","review":" I got this movie from the library, and saw it had a lot of actors I like in it(John Cleese, Ian Holm, Ralph Richardson, etc), so I got it and watched it.

This movie is amazingly pointless, the characters are nobodies, the plot is non-existent, and the ending is one of the worst endings I have ever seen.

The Shipping News is a case in point Proulx's masterful wording cannot be converted into characters, places, things, and visuals without losing its depth. A well-written novel is already alive, in the mind of the reader, and doesn't necessarily need a film to complement its existence. Any undertaking of transferring the intricacies of excellent writing to film is a foolish endeavour, and such is the case with Angela's Ashes. Some things simply can't be duplicated into film, and therefore have no film equivalent. A well-written novel operates on so many different levels that film usually can't capture it all. Frank McCourt's book is grim and gray, engrossing, lively, human, and incisive; it is a living thing in and of itself. While watching the film, it's impossible to feel the same sense of desperate longing as when reading the book, and all the situations look like clichés Frank kneeling in church, Frank getting nooky for the first time, Frank watching his dad walk out on the family. Midnight In The Garden Of Good And Evil was the same way Eastwood tried to make a visual translation of the book and all the charm and humor was sucked out of the book, leaving a stillborn disaster that he probably still gets ribbed about. It isn't impossible to capture the intricacies of a good book, and as proof I offer the existence of Silence of the Lambs and The Godfather. In Angela's Ashes, the characters are almost caricatures of poor people. To visually underscore the despair of Limerick, the director chooses to always have it raining, which fails as a mood-setting device only because it's such an obvious attempt to establish setting; it becomes its own tiresome joke. Remember all those lame O.J. jokes in the mid nineties? That's what this movie is like, with the director constantly nudging you and saying look, they're poor. All right, I get it already. There is little of value in the movie, and you'll take nothing away from it that couldn't be told to you a million times better if you simply read the book instead. Meh. B is for boring.
