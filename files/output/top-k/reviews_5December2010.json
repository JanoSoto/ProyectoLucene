LIS starts off with the family Robinson about to disembark earth in search for another habitual planet. All the favorites from the 60's show are here, ex specially, the self-centered diabolical Dr. Smith and that cheesy robot dispensing out Danger! Danger! Will Robinson!. Up to that point, after the plot and characters have been introduced, the movie then literally gets Lost with what to do with the remaining hour and a half left. They try a number of possible plot points, that all fail miserably, and desperately attempt to keep the audience interested. Too bad they don't even come close. Maybe the problem here is that this was a great set up for the TV series. Because their you had only 22 minutes a week and could afford not so stellar material every week. In a full length feature, however, you must pick one plot point and make sure it is fully fleshed out and enthralling to the audience. What we end up with is a multitude of mini-episodes all put into the plot blender and set on high. The result is a mixture of putrid tripe so rancid you don't even want to try and drink it. For example, the bit with the space-spiders, was so tacked on you almost start to cringe when they come on. Crash landing on the frozen world was a waste of time and flat out dull. But worst of all was the whole Time vortex with the adult Will and mutated Dr. Smith. This was such a half baked concept and could have worked so much better had they given it more time and thought. Yet here its thrown in with sheer desperation. In Conclusion If your a fan of Lost in Space the series, go watch those episodes. If you not, this movie isn't going to change you mind.

Its animation is mostly Saturday Morning level and its plot is as simplistic as a Sherlock Holmes knockoff story can get, complete with plotty, expository script and pretty typical archetypes throughout. Yet, it has something that has been missing in Disney movies for years likability. It's lightweight, well crafted fun, like all the best Saturday morning cartoons, with inventive set pieces and terrific voice acting that helps make up for the fact that the losses incurred on The Black Cauldron show quite clearly. Unfortunately, it was shoveled under the hype over Don Bluth's An American Tail, a film that I have a bit of a soft spot for but which I'm not sure was that much better despite more involved animation. Of course it's no masterpiece, but it does deserve some appreciation for its virtues.The plot's rather simple, and a bit too dialogue driven. Basically, you can figure out what happens before you even see it. What makes it work are the personalities. True, Olivia's a bit cloying, but Basil himself is as manic and fun to watch as any good Holmes knockoff, due in no small part to Barrie Ingham's performance. However, the show stealer, like with many Disney films, is the villain, Professor Ratigan as brilliantly voiced by the great Vincent Price. What I love about his character is that he comes off a narcissistic buffoon most of the time, but when pushed he shows himself to be a ruthless maniac able to wring whatever he wants from people by sheer force. In many ways, he's the villain that Captain Hook should have been. He even gets one of the only song numbers in this movie, one of the finest villain numbers in its jaunty bombast and how it shifts to a dead stop when a henchman double crosses him then shifts back after a rather grim moment in the film.Unfortunately, one wishes the animation was better than Toon Disney on a production level. There's lots of conservative pose-to-pose stuff and very little in the ways of spontaneous character stuff. The angles are all very flat and straightforward. It especially shows in the dog character, who is much larger than the others but has too lightweight a feel to him. It's still a better looking film than The Black Cauldron, however less lavish it may be, and it has a few highlights. Ratigan, again, is superbly animated by Glen Keane, who gives him much more nuance and presence than the other characters. There's also a steep improvement toward the end, where Disney really ratchets up on some terrific set-piece direction. The CGI may show its age, but it's incorporated quite well. One also suspects that Disney first started to look at Hayao Miyazaki's work around this time, since there are more than a few similarities to the climax of Castle of Cagliostro.All in all, these elements, along with a great Henry Mancini score, add up to another overlooked gem of a Disney movie, if not an essential work. It's light nature makes it understandable that some people tend not to care for it, but I enjoy it like I do any decent childhood cartoon. For me, it's the best Disney picture between the end of the golden age in the 60s and the renaissance at the end of the 80s, despite not being especially ambitious or innovative. It's just good fun, and what more can one ask for?

Meet the Parents is about a man, Gaylord Focker, who goes by the name of Greg (Ben Stiller). He is living with his girlfriend, Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo), who he going to ask to marry him. He is not able to ask her yet because Pam invites him to parent's house to attend her sister's, Debbie (Nicole Dehuff), wedding. Pam's father, Jack Byrnes (Robert De Niro), is a retired CIA member who does not trust anyone and he still acts as if he is in the CIA. Jack and Greg do not get off on the right foot because Jack does not act like he likes Greg. So, the movie continues with Greg trying really hard to get Jack's approval while Jack does not make it very easy. Jack thinks that Greg is someone else because Jack could not find evidence of Greg taking a test to become a doctor. Jack tries to convince Pam that he has been lying to her. Greg tries to be helpful, but he ends up almost ruining Debbie's wedding so he gets ready to leave and his luggage arrives. The guy asks if he is Gaylord Focker, and he agrees. Jack realizes that Greg's true name is Gaylord and he made a mistake. So Jack goes to the airport to convince Greg to come back. So, Greg returns and asks Pam to marry him and she says yes. The movie ends with Jack stating that they have to meet Greg's parents. The theme of this movie is that people are always what they seem on the surface. Jack thought that Greg was a liar because Jack thought his first name was Greg except Gaylord is his first name. So, Jack was completely wrong which does not happen very often. Throughout the movie the viewer really roots for Greg because he is a good guy who is trying to impress his girlfriend's parents. He becomes the underdog of the film who can't catch a break. Greg has good intentions that usually end badly in this movie. The angle technique that is used in this movie is great. The viewers really feel like that could be Greg's character. Everyone has been there when they are trying to impress someone and it turns into a disaster. Another great technique that was used was the lighting. It was very natural and the viewers will feel like they are really in the movie. If you like the Family Stone, then you will love Meet the Parents.

As well before the days of special effects, CGI, and 3-D Spielberg did his best making this film with scenes of a mechanical shark. And the film is suspense filled as most scenes don't show the shark directly attacking the victims, yet it's often the things that are hidden and underneath that are the most terrifying like an underwater great white. And most memorable is the pulsating original theme score from the film, you've heard it many times as it just carries the suspense and drama of the film along so well.Based on Peter Benchley's novel(I must say a must read)Jaws is set in a New England northeastern island resort town of Amity. And all of a sudden unexpected bodies float ashore and deaths are reported. And the worst fears of the ocean have come to service a great white shark is responsible. So enter the town's sheriff stressed out Chief Brody(wonderfully played by Roy Scheider)and upon his assumptions and investigations he's meet with resistance and protest from the town mayor Mr. yes man and the politically corrupt Mayor Vaughn(well done by Murray Hamilton)as it's better to lie about shark attacks to the citizens for fear of losing money as people will not want to vacation in Amity if reports of shark attacks are true. Brody does the best to cope with it with support from wife Ellen(Lorraine Gary).Still matters need to be taken further so enter two problem solver helpers one in the form of Sam Quint(Robert Shaw)a weathered and crazy odd ball shark hunter who's methods are unorthodox and then to complete the twosome it's young hotshot educated marine scientist Matt Hooper(Richard Dreyfuss). And along the way this film turns into a suspenseful adventure of shark hunting that's helped by the wonderful and pulsating score it just keeps you on the edge of your seat, as in the end your happy to be served a big great white lunch with the death of Jaws! Overall a film classic one of the 70's better pictures and one of cinemas better suspense thrillers. Well remembered for it's strong and pulsating score which moved the drama and suspense of the film along so well. And the way the scenes were shot Spielberg made many of them hidden and suspenseful by doing them underwater proving what you can't see is most often the most dangerous just like the opening sequence of Chrissy's death. And the way that Steven shot the film even though tough and difficult by filming water scenes and moving the camera a lot on boat was well done and his working of the mechanical shark takes a big bite out of today's special effects and CGI and 3-D works. Really probably Steven Spielberg's best. Jaws is a very memorable cinema classic, one of the all time best films.

So enter the town's sheriff stressed out Chief Brody(wonderfully played by Roy Scheider)and upon his assumptions and investigations he's meet with resistance and protest from the town mayor Mr. yes man and the politically corrupt Mayor Vaughn(well done by Murray Hamilton)as it's better to lie about shark attacks to the citizens for fear of losing money as people will not want to vacation in Amity if reports of shark attacks are true. Brody does the best to cope with it with support from wife Ellen(Lorraine Gary).Still matters need to be taken further so enter two problem solver helpers one in the form of Sam Quint(Robert Shaw)a weathered and crazy odd ball shark hunter who's methods are unorthodox and then to complete the twosome it's young hotshot educated marine scientist Matt Hooper(Richard Dreyfuss). And along the way this film turns into a suspenseful adventure of shark hunting that's helped by the wonderful and pulsating score it just keeps you on the edge of your seat, as in the end your happy to be served a big great white lunch with the death of Jaws! Overall a film classic one of the 70's better pictures and one of cinemas better suspense thrillers. Well remembered for it's strong and pulsating score which moved the drama and suspense of the film along so well. And the way the scenes were shot Spielberg made many of them hidden and suspenseful by doing them underwater proving what you can't see is most often the most dangerous just like the opening sequence of Chrissy's death. And the way that Steven shot the film even though tough and difficult by filming water scenes and moving the camera a lot on boat was well done and his working of the mechanical shark takes a big bite out of today's special effects and CGI and 3-D works. Really probably Steven Spielberg's best. Jaws is a very memorable cinema classic, one of the all time best films.

As well before the days of special effects, CGI, and 3-D Spielberg did his best making this film with scenes of a mechanical shark. And the film is suspense filled as most scenes don't show the shark directly attacking the victims, yet it's often the things that are hidden and underneath that are the most terrifying like an underwater great white.

(1943)The best part of this movie is knowing it was made right in the middle of the war, not in some recreation of the events. It's a little hyperbolic, for sure, but really well acted (both the Nazis and the Czechs), and it ends up being a battle of wits and tricks between the two sides.Fritz Lang was a refuge from Nazi Europe and made this in Hollywood, with an expected sensibility for the cruelties and barbarism of the occupying nasties. And they probably were this nasty--worse, in truth, though less comically so, as the movie sometimes pushes it a bit. Still, really enjoyable, in all. Yet, somehow, it was long. The twists from one scene to another started to sound familiar, and the tension was sustained rather than invigorated, if that makes any sense. Brian Donlevy is the leading good guy here, and he's always a little less than compelling, though he is not in most of the scenes so I suppose that's fine. The double-crosser was played by Gene Lockhart, whose presence grows as the movie gets on, and by the end he's really pretty amazing (far beyond the caricature of, say, the judge he played in Miracle on 34th Street). Walter Brennan makes an appearance, recognizable mostly by his voice. Two of the Nazi higher-ups were terrific, both the Pilsner guzzling brute and the slightly comical but scary gestapo head.Lang is no fool, and he makes this movie not only a pleasure, but an important tool to remind viewers to be involved, to realize that you can fight oppression, even Nazi oppression, with enough wits and sacrifice.

David Lean's sprawling epic set in revolutionary Russia is a masterpiece of movie making and has, like most of Lean's work, inspired countless other films through the decades. Adapted from Boris Pasternak's novel, only Lean could get away with a largely British cast and an Egyptian in the leading role playing out the most tumultuous period of Soviet history. Omar Sharif is faultless as Zhivago, and in many scenes his eyes convey each emotion perfectly without a single line being uttered. So canny is Lean that in numerous scenes there is a brilliant piece of visual trickery as a shaft of light falls over those dark brown pupils to riveting effect. There is also a genius scene where Zhivago, by now totally smitten with Lara (Julie Christie) has to part with her for the first time in 6 months after the two had worked in a hospital together. As she departs, he tearfully trudges back inside the now defunct hospital, and in the corner of the screen, a vase of wilting, dying sunflowers perfectly represents the feelings he is now experiencing for his as yet unrequited love. The metaphor is successfully examined again later on when the emerging spring daffodils depict Zhivago's rekindled enthusiasm after a gruelling winter in which all hope seemed lost. Zhivago is more accessible than Lean's other notable classic, Lawrence Of Arabia, mainly because it is of course a powerful love story set against the backdrop of one of the most barbaric times in modern history. The stunning locations are breathtaking, and of course Maurice Jarre's contagious and famous theme became synonymous with the movie itself. A feast of a picture, this is simply timeless perfection, and cinema as a medium has rarely been better.
