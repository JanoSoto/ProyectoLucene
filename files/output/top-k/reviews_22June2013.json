He wasn't my favourite hero but he was always good for action. I thought I remembered Sudden Death being one of my favourites so I was anxious to watch it again. I'm glad I did because man was it bad. I was completely entertained but now that I've seen so many more movies and become something of a connoisseur I can see all the ridiculously huge plot holes with a movie like this. I mean any good action film requires you to suspend some belief but I'm talking ridiculous gaping plot holes that are just ignored. How is that terrorists completely overtake a stadium during the biggest sporting event ever, blow up cars outside the stadium, have massive gunfights and perform other acts of terrorism without anyone inside the stadium ever having any idea? Its ludicrous. This is only one example but its a major one. The acting for the most part is wooden and even Van Damme who at least has a strong chemistry on screen just doesn't really come alive in this one. Still with those downsides the film is still fun and entertaining and still has some worthy action scenes.Many will poke fun at Jean-Claude Van Damme for his acting abilities but he was a nineties king for a brief moment. He was a martial arts\/action superstar and this seems almost primed for him. The unfortunate part is they misuse him. He hardly does any martial arts and just seems so out of place. His character has no development and doesn't really get the chance to be as charismatic as other heroes in similar films. Powers Boothe actually steals the show in a lot of ways. He is a fantastic lead villain right up there with a great Die Hard villain. Boothe has the look and the delivery and has a cold blooded character not to be messed with. The final show down is epic enough and it is sort of a cool concept but when Boothe's villain finally meets his end it is rather campy but suits the film. Raymond J. Barry also is quite good but sadly underused as the Vice-President of The United States. Whittni Wright and Ross Malinger deserve honourable mention as they both do a good job as Van Damme's children who find themselves in danger. Dorian Harewood is decent as Hallmark but I'm not sure his entire purpose in the film and despite getting one of the cooler death scenes his character feels awkward in the grand scheme of things.Certainly director Peter Hyams is no stranger to a good action film. He worked with Van Damme previously on Timecop and has done a handful of decent to really good action flicks but his best work is usually in sci-fi. This is not his best work. Essentially this is another Die Hard type rip off but its lacking the heart and the smart script that is necessary to make it really something. As the rumour goes this film was originally written as an action\/martial arts spoof film and ultimately I think that is what it ended up being. For all the bad I've said you can't deny its nineties classic status. Its a terrific concept to have the lone hero suddenly have to protect his children, the Vice President and thousands of hockey fans from an insane terrorist at Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals IN Sudden Death Overtime. I don't understand why they made him a fireman as opposed to a police officer which would have made far more sense and helped with some of the glaring plot holes. So basically if you can really let go of logic and sense and just sit back and enjoy a silly action flick then you'll be entertained and find this amusing. A great piece of film making it isn't but I suppose that isn't its goal. 6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"22 June 2013","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" When I was in my teenage years, growing up in the nineties I loved a good action flick with Jean Claude Van Damme.

Despite being 42 and twice divorced he is dating a 17-year-old old girl, Tracey (Mariel Hemingway). His ex-wife Jill (Meryl Streep), who left him for another woman, is writing a book about the breakdown of their marriage and after Isaac quits his job he is left cash poor. Despite his relationship with Tracey, Isaac starts to full for another woman, the intelligential but pretentious Mary (Diane Keaton). But she is a woman who is already in a relationship with Isaac's friend, Yale (Michael Murphy).Manhattan is a great looking film with its black and white cinematography highlighting the city, particularly when we get to see the skyline. Combined with Allen's directional approach of long takes and tracking shots gave the film a very classical feel. Allen is very good at letting a conversation flow and letting the actors interact and reaction off each other.Allen assembles an excellent cast who play their roles perfectly. They all worked well together and were very believable, even Hemingway as nice, a little naïve teenager who is somehow in a relationship with a man 25 years her senior. Streep role was small but was the professional she always is and Keaton was very different to her role in Annie Hall.When compared to Allen's previous film Annie Hall Manhattan is much more grounded and it is more of a drama then a comedy. There are some funny lines but they are much sparer. But there are some comparisons to Annie Hall, we have similar characters like Yale being a little like Rob in Annie Hall and Allen continues his assault on both mainstream TV comedy and pretentiousness. Like Annie Hall attacks Allen pretentious intelligentialism when talking about art and Allen has a continued love for Ingmar Bergman but Allen's character is equally as pretentious as Mary yet he gets a free pass.Isaac comes up across as a very selfish and narcissistic character, he only cared about himself and willing to step over other people for his interests. All the characters selfish as they have affairs with each other and want to have the best of both worlds, like Yale who wants Mary whilst stay with his wife. SPOILER I felt that Isaac's wanting to be with Tracey at the end was a very selfish and basically picked because he just wanted to be with somewhere. Only Tracey comes off in a good light because she has an idealised view of romance and relationships, willing to do anything for Isaac before gaining experience and knowledge from the relationship.I can see why people do like the film but I personally felt it was overrated. Compared to Annie Hall Manhattan lacked heart and passion and felt a much colder film. It is higher to sympathise with the characters in this looser narrative that film has to offer.

I was too young when it came out but I do catch up with some that have outlived their welcome. This one definitely did. Being a fan of Vangelis, I came across the soundtrack and my heart started pounding...I had to watch this!! My excitement mounted and my heart is beating fast as starting credits rolled..Vangelis is cluing me in to the Los Angles of 2019...But then, Harrison Ford stepped in, too wooden to move and too stoic to act, utterly bored to the core. I am wondering at this time if this movie is what it says it is..But then something else happened - the visuals! During the initial sequences, the city is presented at the very zenith of technological innovation and I was expecting that this would ensue.The breathtaking opening scene is a mood setter, is it not? But this was not to be, and therein lies a serious flaw in this movie...which had the immense potential to be a classic, but denigrated itself to be a cult. There is a difference...a classic has passed all accounts of cinematic standards..its beat them all. A cult on the other hand is one that is well liked by many...no reasons given. Most times, the reasons are flawed and this one belongs in that category. Not to digress, but the visuals that I aforementioned - relegates itself to old age cyberpunk,gets well-ingrained into a marginal subculture and becomes the centerpiece of the movie. The character is sidelined, the story goes awry, and the dreary shots of everyday urban Los Angeles, in not-too-distant future gets in your face and repeats itself with staggering consistently. The movie makes a point that despite the technology and the development, there is generally no hope for humanity. The future, my dear friends, has to be depressing and morose, especially for the poor. There is hope, but not for everyone, definitely not for the working class, not for the good only for the technically adept, the rulers of the future. This echoes consistently and is driven home at every turn that Deckard takes..it's always staring in your face like deformed face, wanting you to notice the ugliness, to accept that there is nothing pretty here and you better accept it.When Daryl Hannah,a street whore stepped in and covered herself with papers on the street side...I gave up. Blade Runner,inspite of all the expectations and heart pounding excitement that it garnered within me..had let itself down. And I so..oh so desperately wanted it to shock me with sheer brilliance. But this is another attempt at science fiction, when Ridley Scott was learning his trade. At this juncture, a cinematic genius would have concluded that there is nothing that this young lad can look forward to. But alas, Scott has proved everyone wrong..but not with this one. This one needs to be forgotten!A special mention of course - VANGELIS!! How could a score go so under-utilized? The genius that this score was, should have more than carried the movie...given the right back drop. But Vangelis is no match for the depression-era Los Angeles, cleverly disguised with neon boards and poorly masquerading itself to be 2019. What an eye sore!!While it may be be unwarranted to do so, I take the liberty to contrast this to the science fiction movie of my time - The Matrix. It asks the same questions - What is humanity, can we beat the forces that control us, can we survive this onslaught, is there love, is this life worth it? It answers it too. The difference is - it sets a backdrop where your mind takes hold of it,takes a stand, and root for the good guys. It allows you to recognize yourself- that you are as vulnerable as Neo and yet can do something to change the world. It buys you in. Blade Runner on the other hand, keeps you aloof and at arms length, never opening the door for you to enter the LA of 2019. If does not allow you to emote,to participate, to root for, to empathize. The back drop does not allow this. It says stay away...every which way it can. While there might be a cult following - multiple viewings, and reading into the flick for more that what it's worth, or going away with questions that even Deckard does not ask..is not being faithful to the spirit of a movie.

I should include the 30s also. It is the period of the greatest scripts, they are great even in our days, and also the period of the coolest actors ever to appear on screen. Humphrey Bogart is one of them, and Casablanca is the film that shined most in the 40s. Casablanca has the best script including legendary lines i think 6 of them are included in AFI top 100 lines. It' not just a love story, it's that love story that seems impossible, due to the time when the characters met, and the circumstances in witch they feel in love. Probably, the best scene in the movie is the one with la Marseillaise. It has such deep signification, it's the French national anthem played in a French region in Africa under German occupation during WW II, played while the Germans sang a patriotic song. The scene is presented in great detail, from the beginning, where the band look to Bogart for his approval, to Victor Laszlo' hand gestures and Ilsa's heavy breathing suggesting that she is proud of Laszlo's intention, to the end when a a woman in the crowd with a visible tear shouts Vive La France. The song starts in a shy matter for the French crowd, but it increases immediately and the German are forced to stop singing because they can not be heard anymore. It has the meaning of freedom, of liberty. When you watch this scene you feel good, you think of what the public though when it was first released; back then the war was still on; maybe they though that the war will be over that the good will eventually conquer evil. To conclude, watch this movie, you will love it, you will love the French anthem scene even if you are not French. You will not find a better script or better actors.

T2 delivers a feast of pulse-pounding action, elegantly visualized and finely tuned. Marvelous stunt work, jaw-dropping effects (which haven't aged a day in over a decade on the shelf), and emotional groundwork combine for a sharp, smooth, creative science-fiction action movieStory While Sarah languishes, her offending, teenager son John (Edward Furlong) suffers under difficult foster parents. This not likely hero as Terminator fans well know is apparently destined to become the hope of civilization as the leader of the rebel resistance against cruel artificial intelligence in a post-apocalyptic future. But for now, he's ripping off ATMs to fund video game binges at the mall. So there, nagging parents your lazy son really will amount to something one day! As sensitively played by first-timer Furlong, John Connor is a sensitively wounded spitfire on the peak of young adulthood.Before long, the two Terminators are hunting for John. One is by the machines, wants him dead. The other is a reprogrammed hope of the rebels, has been instructed to protect the boy. In a clever spin on the star's career and the juiced-up sequel's status, Arnold Schwarzenegger plays the good cyborg this time, Model 101, while Robert Patrick plays the faster advanced prototype, the T-1000.Visuals Escalating the unstoppable image of Terminators, the T-1000 is the gift that keeps on giving, made of a copied poly-alloy that allows flawless disguises and quick renewal. The T-1000 takes repeated lickings like being riddled with gun blasts and split in two--and keeps on ticking. He can turn his arms into metal picks and pull neat parlor tricks like instantly making his back his front in a fast-moving brawl. A terrific presentation by Patrick firmly sells the effects. The actor sprints like a machine with a burrowing, level glare and perfectly balanced movement. The dream sequence with the nuclear explosion is still equally as haunting today as it was at the time. The visuals are absolutely amazing and over 20 years later still stand the test of time.Overall You've got a great story, characters you care about and a great writing. Overall the movie is an absolute blast. The first time I saw it was when I was four years old and instantly fell in love with it. Terminator 2 is my most watched movie, I've seen countless times. It truly is a remarkable film, and a must see.

It was really, how do I say this... graphic and realistic. It made me feel how WW2 affected soldiers like the ones in the movie. It also taught me war was more bloody and gory, not what I see in movies like Apocalypse Now or The Longest Day. I'd also praise the actors performance. They seemed to have the right emotions and I could tell each and every single character personality. But somewhat, I have lots of questions. I have lots to ask, but here's one How was it possible that Ryan's Mother managed to get contact of her son's deaths in only days after they died? How did they even know Sean, Peter or Daniel Ryan died in the first place? Many other plot holes I didn't get, so I gave this film a 9\/10. Thanks for reading.
