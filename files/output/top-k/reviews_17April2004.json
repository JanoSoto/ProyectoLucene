Some just think it's too sentimental in some areas, but I just don't agree. Sure, Frank Darabont may have had a one time hit from a Stephen King novel, but what he was able to do with this character driven compelling story truly amazes me.  The movie gets me every time, draws me in and holds me there.  The use of voice-over is used so well in this movie and the range of emotion from Morgan Freeman's character just astonishes me.It follows twenty years of the Red character, played by Morgan Freeman and it chronicles his life in a maximum-security prison and how one Andy Dufresne affects his life played brilliantly by Tim Robbins.  Now, some may argue with me that it is Tim Robbins movie, but I would have to disagree since the character that goes through the acceptance and the change throughout the story is Red.  This is the one movie where you could really have two leads, two protagonists, because they are both developed so well and their relationship is so fascinating to watch.I never tire of this movie.  The end monologue still makes me tear up every time, and it doesn't matter if I watched the movie all the way through, or if I just popped in for the last few minutes on TBS.  It is such a masterfully told story of redemption and hope that if you love storytelling, you will love this movie.

At first was when i was about 15 or 16 and didnt really pay attention to any of the dialogue and just waited for something to happen.Some time later, when I actually payed attention to the dialogue, and reading the book after, I realized this was the greatest movie ever made, without a doubt. This of course poses questions for debate. But if your likes mainly exist in special effects, of buildings, cars, or people being constantly blown up, then you wont really get a kick out of anything in this movie. Ive realized almost all of the people who dont like the Godfather are more interested in action flicks. Again, no offense taken, thats just the way I percieve it. Many people say, I was waiting for something to happen and nothing did so I turned it off.  If the restaurant scene with Solozzo and the Police Captain was not enough for you, its your loss.The whole point of it being a mafia movie is about respect and morals. Not really constant shootings and killings. But the bottom line of the movie is about one of the sons, who happens to be the brains and the innocent one of the 3, but gets involved in the family business because of family values, and sooon thereafter becomes entangled in a struggle for power, which turns him, a good guy, into a monster. Its incredible. Pacinos acting is amazing. And so are the rest of the casts, including Duvall, who is severely underrated.  People complain about Brandos voice and not being able to understand him. Thats because he got shot in the throat in a hit earlier in his life.There are alot of great movies out there. Goodfellas, Scarface, Casino...But this is in my opinion the greatest time piece ever, and most genuine. The whole movie is realistic, something that alot of people can identify with, with family morals and values and so forth.

Never go to sleep, because when you close your eyes, they come.  They come and snatch your mind away.  And, you never wake up.  Your memories come to life in another body that looks like you, and acts like you, but it's not you.  It's a pod-person from outer space who has reproduced himself as you.  This is the terror of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, one of the most dystopian, and original, science fiction stories ever written.  The DVD includes a 1985 interview with Kevin McCarthy, who says he never thought the film had any symbolism or allegorical message.  That came later, he says.  He quotes author Jack Finney as saying he Finney never wrote it that way.  I saw this movie in 1956, it is likely the first movie I ever saw in a theater, and never felt then or now that it has any symbolic meaning.  It's a scary story that flat out rocks, and I recommend you approach it as such.  But, this does beg the question of all those comments about the aliens who don't need love or any emotion, who believe humanity is better off without them.  Why are they in the script, and what do they mean?  I want to suggest they are what makes the pod-people scary.  The notion of assimilation is inherently scary, of course, and one could argue that no embellishment is necessary, but I think the story as a story is weakened without it. There is a continuity error in this story that has bothered me for more than forty years.  Spoiler alert, just in case.  In the final sequence, Becky falls asleep, just for a moment, and wakes up a pod person, but that's not how the assimilation takes place.  They come at night during sleep and snatch human memories that are migrated into a copy of the original body.  Miles speculates that the original body simply disintegrates, and the soul perishes.  Becky should have died, and another Becky with her memories should have appeared, but that body should never have regained consciousness as a pod person or human.  A minor nit, really, that bothers me less now that I understand it is a nit.  The original movie does not contain the opening scene at the hospital, or the epilogue, also at the hospital.  They were added because the studio felt the original ending was too depressing.  Some feel these additions do not work, but I am not one of them.  They add considerably, in fact, to the power of this story.  Miles' face in the closing scene is a vivid memory I've carried for almost half a century.  His reaction is a catharsis for him personally and his audience.  It's a powerful vicarious emotional experience, and the movie would be not nearly as good without it. Kevin McCarthy and Dana Wynter are outstanding here.  Wynter is one of the most beautiful women ever to appear onscreen and her first entrance is stunning.

Jean Willes and King Donovan are good in supporting roles.  This is one of the best pictures of its year, of its decade, and dare I say it, of all time.  9 out of 10.

I have seen it probably a hundred times, not kidding, and can recite almost the whole thing. But it is only a movie. It's a story, meant to entertain and take you away from reality. It is not supposed to be realistic, in events or characters or anything else. She's a mermaid with talking animals for friends! It's not going to make girls become airheads, which Ariel is not by the way, or make them marry young or anything else, any more than it will make crabs sing and dance. It's a fairy tale, most of which are silly and full of unrealistic characters anyways. That said, Ariel is a very intelligent and strong character. She and Eric are in love because it's meant to be. If you think three days is a short time to wait before marriage try reading other fairy tales where they wed ten minuets after they meet. Besides which, there is no indication that weeks or months didn't pass between the kiss on the beach and the wedding. Anyhoo, the movie is spectacular in its animation, music, voices, and characters. And my last two points are that Eric does not go for Vanessa because he is a twit, but because he is bewitched. She's a witch, he's under a spell, see the glowy yellow eyes.

I liked it, but I felt somewhat removed from the underbelly of the high class social world.  But the second time around, the whole film reached out, grabbed me, sucked me in, and then spit me out, sort of like Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) getting the boot from the scary, deep voiced, masked man, at the mansion.  Like Bill, I felt overwhelmed by the whole `show' of psycho-sexual displays among multiple party after party, at the mansion, where men roamed around masked and caped, and women, all with hour glass figures, glided topless, with faces concealed by feathered masks.  This incredible screen play written by Stanley Kubrick and Frederic Raphael is adapted from Arthur Schnitzler's novel.  The film is superbly executed by Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, who play the two main characters. Tom Cruise so convincingly plays Bill Harford, a young, but mature New York doctor.  With his wife, Alice Harford (Nicole Kidman), they have a seven year old girl.  Every year the two attend Victor Ziegler's (Sydney Pollack) annual holiday black tie dinner dance, held at a hotel.  That night Bill and Alice innocently separate, only to find themselves in the arms of another.  Alice warmed and mellowed from the champagne, dances the night away with a matured Hungarian gigolo.  Meanwhile, Bill recognizes Nick Nightingale (Todd Field), the piano player, who is a former medical student friend of Bill's.  Nick, married, a father of four, from Seattle, is now playing New York gigs to support his family, back home, in Seattle.  Not soon later, two models are thoroughly enjoying their flirtatious moment with Bill.  But the session is soon interrupted, when Bill is asked to meet Victor in an upstairs room.  Mandy (Julienne Davis), a prostitute and Victor's playmate, is lying naked and drugged out, in a chair.  Upon bringing her conscious, Bill confirms that she will be alright.  Victor is eager to extinguish Mandy from his room immediately, but Bill insists that Victor let her rest for an hour.  Bottom line, at this moment, Bill is smart, professional, and sensitive, and Victor is completely not.That night, Alice and Bill suffer post party blues, in their bedroom together.  They smoke a joint and begin to talk about their sexual thoughts.  When Alice tells of her wanderings to another man, I had problems hearing the audio.  It appears that she is not completely sure if she slept with another man or not.  Needless to say, Bill is stunned.  His naiveté about his wife's carnal desires is surprising, but this aspect is all part of the story.  On the other hand, Alice accuses Bill of having sexual thoughts during his patient exams.  Bill defends that sex is the last thing on his or the patient's mind, during that time.  We believe Bill's claim.  It is valid and makes complete common sense.  Back at work, Bill begins dreaming of Alice having passionate sex with another man.  Of course, the dream is like a black and white film, which is appropriate coming from Bill's thoughts.  These thoughts of her infidelity eat away at his sense of security and trust.  At night, a prostitute picks up Bill, where else but on a street corner!  When his wife calls on the cell phone, just before he is about to have sex with the hooker, he changes his mind about having sex.  He pays the woman and walks away.  Late that night, he stops by a night club, where Nick happens to be playing a gig.  The two sit down and talk.  Nick tells Bill of his next job at a mansion, where he is required to play blindfolded.  Bill wants to find his `other desire,' just as his wife has admitted to her own.  He wants to attend the mansion soirée.  Nick gives Bill the password, `Fedaglio,' in which to enter the estate.But before Bill attends the party, he must have the proper attire a black tuxedo, a mask, and a cape.  Purchasing the goods from `Over the Rainbow,' costume shop, in the middle of the night, with tux, cape, and gold decorated mask, he attends this dark, ritualistic, and cult-like party, full of topless women, with feathered masks and tasteful (are there any other kind among the high class?) sexual orgies in every room.  Once at the party via taxi, a masked woman tells Bill that his life could be in grave danger and that he should leave.  Bill stays, until that is, a clan leader asks him to repeat the house password, not the password to get into the house.  Victor will later tell Bill that there is no other password.  Once again, the masked woman comes to Bill's rescue sparing him full nudity in front of all and who knows what else.  He leaves as he came, by taxi.Now is it 400 a.m. when he arrives at home, and Alice admits that she was dreaming of f***ing so many men, that she could no longer keep track.  She is in tears and Bill is disturbed by, what I will refer to as, his Fedaglio experience.  The two turn in after their tumultuous experiences.The next night, Bill brings a gift to the prostitute, with whom he was going to have sex.  He learns from the roommate, that she has just been diagnosed with AIDS.  This is the second wave of naiveté for Bill.  He is completely stunned and glazed by the news.  Gathering his senses in a coffee shop, he reads an article in the paper, that Amanda Curren has died from drug overdose.  He views the body and recognizes it as `Mandy,' Victor's sex mate.  Was Mandy a drug and sex addict?  Victor confesses that she willingly took drugs on her own volition.  Therefore, one would conclude no foul play.  Nevertheless, Bill is neither pleased nor satisfied.  Victor says to Bill, something to the effect, `Bill, you were never really invited to the party, and as a result, the guests put on a show for you, to shock you.'  Bill replies with command, `no show should end up with a woman being murdered, Victor!' Bill and Alice, now strolling through FAO Schwarz, with their little seven year old daughter, realize they both need to strengthen their relationship.  They realize future adult temptations are in front of them.  The film ends with our minds left to wonder how they will handle their own and surrounding relationships.  I would definitely love to see an Eyes Wide Shut, Volume II.  If the script worked, it would have to fit Cruise and Kidman in the present.  I am sure the writers would have plenty of material with which to work.  Eyes Wide Shut is a great spectacle of sexual tribalism, at its pinnacle.  It reflects communal sexual ownership or bondage, in contrast to the struggles of monogamy and privacy, in a marriage, as depicted by Bill and Alice.  Looking back, as to when it came out, it was highly underrated and valued, as to its importance and relevance of contemporary thought provoking issues.  Possibly, at that time, mass culture was not in tune to the nature of this subject matter.  If you have not seen this film, I highly recommend that you do.  You will not be disappointed in the very life-like interpretative mood to this subject matter.

Little did I know what a huge success it really turned out to be! Bruce Willis was perfect for playing the notorious killer simply known as 'The Jackal', this could of been a huge flop it the wrong sort of actor had this crucial main part, but Bruce really brought this character to life and made him extremely believable. I was also pleasantly surprised that even Richard Gere acted really well considering he wasn't in a chick flick like Chicago, he also had a great Irish accent. The thing that's clever about this film is I really liked The Jackal, because of how serious he seems but still delivers a comical attribute in his own unique way. If your lucky enough to see this for the first time look out for The Jackal's huge dominating sniper, this has to be the greatest sniper I've ever seen. It apparently fires 100 bullets before the first bullet even hits its target. Thankfully this tremendous film had a really good ending that really keeps you on the edge of your seat, with great dramatic tension. But overall I would recommend this film to anyone who wants to be entertained from start to finish; it's without a doubt another must-see.

It's mostly a delve into a man's (Nick Nolte) psyche, a divorced alcoholic man who was abused as a child by his drunken father (James Coburn).  He tries to cope, he tries to make something of himself by attempting to solve a hunting accident which he thinks is really a murder.  He claims that after this, everyone will remember him as a hero.Luckily the audience isn't made to believe Nolte's cause, to us he looks just as mad as he does to the characters around them.  This is well done, because it could've been presented as some big twist at the end.Anyway, the mystery element to the film isn't that important.  It's mostly about how hard - and almost impossible - it is to prevent an emotionally abused man to make the same mistakes his father made.  This idea is presented well, but by the end it just feels so thick and depressing that it's hard to take anything from the film, because you don't want to remember it.Acting-wise the movie is quite good.  Nolte delivers what I think is his best performance here, with a quiet desperation wonderfully put out by his eyes, voice, face, and so on.  James Coburn does his usual well, but I have to question just why he won an Oscar for this.  Don't get me wrong, he was a terrific actor and his performance in this is great, but he's not in many scenes, and the scenes he is in are mostly just a variation of the same thing Coburn drunkenly and violently mumbles at his sons and eventually starts to yell and thrash.  This is all well and good, but his scenes never go beyond that, except for (maybe) at the end when he spews his own sort of twisted philosophy to Nolte.Other great performances come from Sissy Spacek as Nolte's increasingly uneasy girlfriend. Also Willem Dafoe as Nolte's brother who is so concerned with being quiet and not problematic that he cant prevent the build-up of violence and abuse in his family.  I'd say that this performance is more Oscar worthy than Coburn's.This is a good movie with a great message, but it doesn't put enough on the table, 7\/10.

Peter Jackson accomplished the impossible in the new millennium.Everything was brilliant, ranging from costumes, to set design, special effects, score, editing, acting, direction, everything...I am writing this after writing a comment for the Return of the King but still, I thought I needed to comment on this as well. FOTR was brilliant and it deserved every award at the Oscars...but the Oscars were unfair. Even The Two Towers deserved more nominations and awards but didn't.The complex story of the Lord of the Rings commences with The Fellowship of the Ring. The young hobbit Frodo has to venture out with a fellowship to destroy the One Ring which determines the fate of his world- Middle- Earth. PJ just makes this movie worth the watch. The actors are just excellent. I wish Elijah Wood would have got an Oscar but that's a pity.What I think is so great about the story and the movie is their density. Everything that happens keeps your adrenaline rushing and keeps you interested for so long. Many people wouldn't mind if this movie or the other two ran for +4 hours!Anyway, I think this was a great movie and a brilliant start to a wonderful, indulging, meaningful trilogy.One of my favourite movies (along with TTT and ROTK and a few others). A 10\/10 movie!

Sure, the synthesizers may sound a bit dated by today's standards, but given the subject matter in this film, it all fits perfectly. It would not be the same without it.Rarely have I heard so much attention to detail in a soundtrack - especially a sci-fi one. The art of making a good soundtrack is perhaps subtle to some, but Vangelis knew how to create the unconscious effect of suggestion to make his music fit the scene perfectly. This process involves more than picking minors for sad scenes, and majors for happy ones. Then also there is timbre as well as tonal quality to consider.The music for the opening scene is immediately ear-catching. The big 'THUUUMMMMP' is simply scary and acts as an 'anti-gong'. It is the pronouncement of our future doom. To this day, the Waldorf 'Q' series of synthesizers uses an emulation of this sound as a showcase patch.Other highlights here include- The 'Blade Runner Blues' theme - Played where a replicant woman is shot in the back and crashes through panes of glass in slow motion. The blues theme is in perfect keeping with the whole 'noir' feel and yet, in keeping with the futuristic setting, the lead is held by a synthesizer, not a saxophone.- 'Rachel's Song' - Although the strings and woman's voice sooth, the constant metallic 'plinking' in the background reminds you that Rachel is a machine.- 'Memories of Green' - This is the music played at the piano scene where Rachel remembers her implanted memories. The heavily detuned piano suggests age, but the electronic sounds in the background remind the listener that this too is not real, even if it seems so to her. This song is very Debussy-like suggesting this is what she remembers playing in her earlier memories. Subtle!- 'Tears in Rain' - It is Roy Batty's last scene and perhaps one of the most poignant ones on film. An uplifting theme to match the releasing of the dove into the sky and signifying the release of a soul.- There are snippets of music played in various scenes that have distinctly Oriental overtones to them. Often, this music is heard echoing across the city or in other public places. This reflects the theme of an  L.A. in 2019 with a meshing of Western and Oriental musical styles.I don't think Vangelis got near his due here and my hat's off to him and to Ridley Scott for having the foresight to choose him. Next time you see this film, pay attention to the musical themes. Try to imagine what those scenes would be like without the music to set you on the path.

There was so much symbolisim and moments that people will never forget that it will change the way they think what a good movie is.From the crow being set free to a thunderstorm and all the way to each and everybody character, everything symbolized something in this movie. It isn't hard tofigure out what each and every one of them means though like Lord of the Flies and still makes you think even more then Lord of the Flies. To add on Lord of the Flies was boring and this left the viewer on the edge of there seat thoughout the whole movie.Gasping, crying, laughing, heartbroken, thrilled are all some of the very emotions you'll feel in this movie then almost any other movie ever made. A connection to the characters can eaisly be made many times thoughout the movie and you simply want to goodguys to win, even if they arn't goodguys in society.The acting was amazing and perfect. Freeman delivered each and every monologue perfectly and professionally and put up as great as a preformance, if not better, then the movie Se7en. Robbins put up his best preformance anybody will probibly ever see him in making us connect to him and leaving a mystery though half the movie weather he did shoot his wife or if he was innosent. The Warden (Gunton) reaches to one of the great movie villians I've seen and the other bad guy Byron (Brown) puts up a preformance almost as great as Sgt. Heart from Full Medal Jacket. Tommy Williams at first sight makes you seem like he's an elvis wannabe who seriously needs a life, but after time when Robbins starts to work with him you start to feel for him until your left in gasp at his last scene. Whitmore, who plays Brooks, has the viewer laughing, crying and screaming no at parts. The acting was perfect by all the major characters.What could be perfect acting without perfect writing and perfect dialouge though? Stephen King wrote a masterpeice and it was written into perfect dialouge for this movie. Each and every monolouge was written to a masterpeice.The directing was just perfect also, enough said.To those that haven't seen this movie yet, I suggest to go see it a.s.a.p to know what a perfect movie is.
