I was curious to find out what was wrong with this movie, when i read about its reputation, and as i love sci-fi i decided to buy the dvd, specialy after reading all the bad comments around here. As many  people compared Supernova to Event Horizon, i was sure i was going to love it, because i still think Event Horizon ranks among the top best sci-fi movies of the last two decades despite its plot-influences.Well, Supernova trully disapointed me, but that doesn´t mean that i think it´s as bad as many claim. Actualy i think it is an excelent sci-fi B-Movie.Altough it costed a fortune it still looks like it was filmed by Roger Corman, and that was what appealed to me despite everything.And as i wasn´t expecting anything spectacular to begin with, i didn´t got disapointed.Actualy the only thing that disapointed me was that Supernova is not even half as good as Event Horizon despite having everything to be a good adult sci-fi movie. By watching the deleted scenes on the dvd, i can´t help to feel that somewhere there was a brilliant idea here for a sci-fi, but someone decided to throw it all through a window and i can bet it wasn´t its creators but some Hollywood executive who did the damage.It´s sad to see how the good ideas that the movie still shows glimpses of, were wasted and replaced by action scenes and happy endings, leaving nothing of the great disturbing feeling that it was set to build up in the scenes that were deleted from the final cut of the movie. This is realy hard to describe, specialy to the people who only saw the theatrical version, but the original initial (deleted) scene with the captain´s introduction realy show us how special this story was being set up to be, and it must be one of the most simple and beautifuly shot introductions for a sci-fi movie ever. As the original ending must be one of the most disturbing and original endings ever filmed. Just for these concepts this (dvd) movie is a must see for everyone who trully loves science-fiction. If you can take the pain of watching a good sci-fi movie being totaly trashed through out 80 minutes of its duration, you´ll love the wasted ideas and concepts present in Supernova. But this is just for sci-fi fans only, not for the general audiences who made Matrix a sucess.Speaking about Matrix, if you get the Supernova dvd, don´t miss its theatrical trailler, for it´s trully a work of Art, and totaly gives the idea that Supernova is going to be something like a cross between Matrix, Scream, Terminator and 2001. It even has a contemporany Pop\/Rock soundtrack as a music background in it ! (What ?!!!!) This must be the most misleading trailler i ever saw in my entire life, and so no wonder how so many people trash this movie. Everybody who went to see Supernova because of the trailler was totaly fooled ! This is not another cool sci-fi teen-movie. But it´s a brilliant trailler, and an hilarious one also, for we can see that somewhere in Hollywood someone was desperate to turn Supernova into another Matrix and i´m sure that was what totaly destroyed Supernova as the inovating sci-fi movie it could have been.So, good points...the special effects are very good, particulary the hyper-jump wich is the most spectacular i ever saw. The production design is fantastic altough a bit limited in variety, but it has a brilliant retro 50´s style mixed with modern sci-fy concepts wich gives unique visuals to this movie. Good actors who can do wonders with their characters despite the awfull limitations the (filmed) script has, except maybe for the Tom Cruise clone. The relation between the ship´s computer and a human wich could have been fantasticaly developed but it was not. The soundtrack is excelent and atmospheric. And the photography and edditing save the movie from being a total waste. On dvd, the original begining and ending wich are excelent sci-fi moments.Bad points...the idiotic and predictable good-guys run from bad dude terminator style plot. The total lack of suspance. The total lack of horror or chilling moments wich could have done wonders for this movie. Boring action. And finaly but not least the Tom Cruise clone ! Maybe this is a good point, because as impersonations go, the bad guy impersonation of Tom Cruise is the most impressive one i ever saw. There are times we forgget we are actualy not looking at Tom Cruise but at another actor instead. What was the idea here ?...A Bowfinger style concept ?! Did someone fooled Cruise into this movie without him knowing about ?...Anyway, don´t trash this movie, because it´s not that bad. It´s just it could have been brilliant instead. I hope someone decides to grab some of the concepts present here and make a realy good movie with them because the potential is there, just loose the T2 Tom Cruise next time please...7 out of 10 despite everything it´s a miracle that this is a very watchable film. There are much worse (sucessful) things you can see out there, so have fun with Supernova and stop complaining. Just don´t be fooled by the trailler and you´ll have fun.

Let women direct more, I say, and let budgets be slashed in subatomic particles. Most importantly, let people who have stuff to say, say it. All the other ones should wait for inspiration.One of the amazing things about this film is its pace. It is breathless, and you never quite stop laughing or gasping or having some variety of intense edge-of-your-seat emotional reaction. Which is amazing, because the plot is so complex, it could easily have gotten lost in chaos. Even as you laugh, the tension doesn't let up. The stories unfold rapidly and dramatically and with full comic timing, and you never quite stop marveling. We are not treated very often to this kind of inventive filmmaking.If you've lived in LA for any significant length of time, you'll realize from the start that this film is not meant to be realistic. The MTA scenes at the beginning are so un-LA, so colorful and happy, you know this is going to be a grand fest of the imagination and the heart, not a tale of urban life. (For one, people on MTA buses tend to sit dejectedly, not to have a collective laugh&lovefest). Similarly, the ethnic angle is more life-as-we-would-like-it-to-be than life-as-is.

I mean, WOW! What if the remote got into the hands of kids that didn't believe in promiscuous sex? I actually know some kids who still hold conservative values (and believe it or not, they are happy, and I know this because they are in color!!!), and what if it got into their hands? I mean what a disaster this film would have been if Barney didn't send a girl who was willing to seduce a black and white character from an old TV show on the first night she's there, without even getting freaked-out about her strange new circumstances (which convinced me that she qualified for her first gang-bang video!!). Really, Pleasantville was very lucky because the remote wasn't even meant for her, even though she was the catalyst to the town finding itself. Of course, David (Bud) is an excellent brother! Not concerning himself when his sister is tells him that she's had all kinds of sex, but staying focused on ridding a 50's fantasyland of it's values, he learned in the end that no place is perfect while helping poor Pleasantville understand the power of choice.Just in case you haven't figured it out, this film disgusted me. Once again we are indulged by the minds of those who detest absolutes yet weave a tale framed in an absolute ideology! I commend Gary Ross, the book burning was a good touch. This movie was politically and socially motivated. Absolutely teaching that Conservatism is bad and Liberalism is good. Choice? I see Ross making a sequel... this time maybe having kids come from out of Pleasantville to the present, maybe getting suspended when they pray in school,or maybe getting blown away after being asked if they believe in God or not!!!

One character is both the antagonist and antagonist. Mr. destiny, It's a Wonderful Life, Sliding Doors are a few that come to mind, all good films.The Family Man doesn't disappoint either. It's yet another take on an idea that's been done before, but it's a great story for telling cinematically. Its creators manage to make it seem fresh, even though it tips its hat to its predecessors, especially Capra's Christmas classic. There's the obligatory angel who comes to earth to teach mortals a lesson. Nicholas Cage plays Jack Campbell, president of a Wall Street investment firm. He even raises the pitch of his voice an octave and sticks his nose up in the air most of the time just to seem like more of a snob. Always versatile, Cage fits himself into the role perfectly. Cage's Jack is a stiff on the outside; putting on the armor of heartless businessman to get the job done, to endure the lonely life he's created for himself. But the man's got a big heart, as evidenced by an act of heroic kindness in a convenience store on Christmas Eve. He then goes even further and tries to help the homeless bum who just held the store up at gunpoint. He's just exposed himself, let his good side come out. He's now been chosen. Whether he likes it or not, he's going to get a glimpse of what his life would have been like had he not left his heart at the airport thirteen years before.It was then that he left Kate (Tea Leoni), the love of his life, behind.

Most of the film's comedy is supplied by Jack having to ask people how his life became so terrible. Are you okay? is asked a lot. Most people just laugh. It's just Jack being Jack. This was a nice touch on the writer's part. We're shown a videotape of Jack singing at Kate's birthday party and acting like he can't remember he's married to her. When he acts that way for real in the present, she just throws up her hand saying, Jack, please, it's not funny any more. The key to this film is its script, which is solid. Only Jack's oldest daughter suspects anything is really amiss, except she believes that aliens must have kidnapped her real dad and replaced him with an exact replica. She becomes in invaluable resource then, showing him how to do things like change dirty diapers. This was genuinely cute and genuinely funny.The film trips up at a critical time though the ending. It's a bit cliché by ending at the airport (with the token shot of the hero running through the terminal chasing his true love). Their intention is to bookend the film with airport scenes. Okay fine, but the ending leaves too many questions unanswered.

The problem with Star Bores, in my opinion, is two fold  the contact lens character depth (or is that Mc Donald's hamburger tomato slice thickness?), and  secondarily the use of special effects to take the place of any real acting or plot development.   People frequently confuse glitz with real acting, and plot development.I still take delight in watching Kubrick's timeless classic, 30+ years after its release. The only other film that does this for me, is the classic Wizard of Oz, which is my personal favourite -- I've seen it probably close to 100 times, since I was born in 1952!  The message is timeless.It is unknown whether Arthur Clarke's vision of an orbiting space station as depicted in his book, will ever be a reality, but I think Clarke showed remarkable  visionary prowess in his novel, which if memory serves me correctly, was written in the 1940's.Wayno ","genre":"Mystery, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"3 January 2001","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  I started with watching the classic T.V. show so by the time I wanted to see the movie, I was already well acquainted with the characters of Hawkeye, Trapper, Frank, Henry, Radar, Father Mulcahy and Hot-Lips.

Some people think it isn't a war movie unless it has big, bold opening credits and a loud, useless, ear-popping fanfare theme song. M*A*S*H shows the stupidity and horror of war.

This is one movie you should definitely seek out.  Everything is portrayed as is, no fuss, no overacting, just as it would be in any downtown neighbourhood.  The sadness felt by Claude is a paradox to her feelings for Ellen at the same time, and when she breaks down while singing to Patti Smith's classic P**ing in a river you can feel her soul breaking down too.What makes the movie special is that clearly it deals with coming out in a sensible mature manner, not in a patronising way, and together with the well paced riot grrrrl soundtrack, makes the semi-grunge atmosphere and dress the characters have seem real too.  Alison Folland is excellent as the confused but sensible Claude, and Leisha Hailey as Lucy  is inspired casting.  Similarly, Tara Subkoff as Ellen has to go through emotional and drug hell and portrays that side really alarmingly well.Do go rent or buy it, and watch with an open mind.
