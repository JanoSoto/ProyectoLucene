So I came into this movie not knowing what to expect for the crew of the Andrea Gail and the coast guard rescue folks. Imagine going to see Titanic not knowing the ship hits an iceberg and sinks at the end. Same deal.Anyway, The Perfect Storm started out a little slow but when the storm hit, things got intense and exciting. George Clooney played a very believable and stressed out Capt. Billy Tyne. Tyne was under some major pressure to produce some fish. He and his crew needed to make some money so they went WAY out and get caught in one of the weirdest and worst storm combinations in the history of meterology. The special effects during the storm were tremendous. The photography was tense and exciting as the crew of the Andrea Gail fight for their lives. Mark Walhberg's Bobby Shatford was a very likable character. Walhberg is really beggining to become a really good actor as he played Shatford with such feeling, it was almost too sad to see what happend to the character at the end.===READERS SPOILER ALERT===> And that's really why I rated the Perfect Storm a 7 instead of a 10. You spend the whole movie getting attatched to these characters, rooting for them to survive only to see ALL of them, not just one, not most, but ALL of them die. To those who remember the story of the Andrea Gail in 91, this is not a surprise. But for me, as a person who did not recall the story, it was a shocking finish. The tearful end to Mark Wahlberg's character was just the end of a bad series of events. It was truly a major letdown. The ending scene of the funeral with all the loveones weeping about the deaths of the crew was just gutwrenching. As we left the theater, there was not one happy, smiling face in the crowd. Every one was miserable because of the feelings the movie pulls out of you. ===END SPOILERS==> Despite the ending, this movie was a cinematic feat on par with the thrilling Twister. It was tense, exciting, and fun.While, for the reasons stated above, I didn't give the film a perfect score, the Perfect Storm is definitely a movie I'd recommend to see.

I've never done that. It has since become my all time favourite film, but it didn't start out that way. After seeing it for the first time, my reaction was Well, it's not bad... I can see why it's a cult movie... all that singing would be good in a cinema, but it's not great. Somehow I decided to watch it once more before taping over it, and this time I really started to like it. Over the end credits I actually got up and started dancing (I have no life, I know), and I knew there was something happening cause I'd never done that before. I think that it actually does get better on a second viewing, just because the beginning is so slow going (all that silence), you expect the rest of the movie to be like that, which of course it's not. **What I'm saying is.. watch this movie twice!!** I love this movie, mainly because I feel indebted to it for helping to get me listening to blues and also old rock and roll. Before I saw this I just put up with whatever teeniebopper crap was on the radio, but then I bought the soundtrack, then heaps of other Blues Bros stuff, then I dug out my families old record colection (that hadn't been played for 10 years) and now I hardly listen to the new stuff. For this I am grateful. It also got me watching cult movies, before I saw this I never saw myself watching things like Plan 9 From outer Space. In short, this one movie changed my life, my tastes in music, movies and fashion. It taught me what makes a good comedy, it inspired me to track down old SNL tapes, and I was introduced to John Belushi, and the talent of Dan Aykroyd (who I'd never liked much till I saw this). By the way, why does everyone praise this as Belushi's film and brainchild, when it was Aykroyd who suggested the band, who introduced Belushi to the blues, who wrote the screenplay? Oh well. Whoever you are, go and see this film. Now. If you've already seen it, then see it again. Good. Now wait three days and watch it again. Buy the soundtrack. Or better yet, buy the Blues Brothers complete (all three albums rolled into one). Now go to a late night screening of it. Very good. See, that wasn't so hard was it?

I am glad I read all those bad reviews, because it turned this movie into even a bigger touching, heart-warming, adrenaline pumping, heart pounding, edge of the seat, spirit lifting spectacle. The Director of 'Das Boot' doesn't let you down. How people can even use the word 'boring' to describe this movie is beyond comprehension. Those people need to get some serious help.From very beginning the movie captures the mood of tough fishing town perfectly. The fact that when boats come back, and they not only bring fish back, but also dead bodies of the crew members, lets you know what kind of tough job and tough people we are talking about here. When Wahlberg's character after spending weeks at sea, working hard and risking life, gets his cut of two thousand dollars, you can see the despair yet toughness and determination on his face. Then the director spends some time introducing the characters, showing their strengths and weaknesses, their humanity, and their sense of humor, giving them depth, so that we know they are not some comic characters, but regular folks just like us. The crew heads to sea, not only to reverse their misfortunes, but to salvage their pride, to not to come back home busted again, to face their loved ones. They have more than enough at home to make them want to come back, yet they have more than money at stake in this trip, its their pride. These two points, series of misfortunes and hurt pride are the reason, they are determined even to take on Mother Nature's most powerful creation, The Perfect Storm.One of the great scenes is when the crew has finally decided to take on the Storm, and they are standing together at the edge of the boat, waiting silently and staring at the ominous thunder and lightning and demonic dark clouds, into which they are directly headed. That is the mother of all gut check moments, and this crew had plenty of it. Up until now, the expression 'at the edge of the seat' was only an expression to me, but during this movie I realized what it meant and how it was literally true. Till the last moment, when credits start to roll, you will be in danger of falling from your seat. The glorious effects will remind you of power of nature, and hence power of something or someone, more powerful than man.The movie is all about guts and courage, and how naturally, without a moment of thought or hesitation, courage and glory come to brave men and women. This is what it must mean to inspire courage and to lift spirits.As far as characters go, they are all very good. Wahlberg just keeps getting better and better. This man will have a stockpile of awards at his home before he is done. Mary Antonio has only two scenes, and she makes them both memorable. What an amazing actress!!! George Clooney on the other hand did a so and so job, and did not finish his homework. He and Diane Lane were either mis-cast, or not ready for their respective roles. They both got better as the movie went on, and in the end they are just as good as others, but during the beginning of the movie they feel like two fish out of water. Clooney does not appear to be a man who has lived a hard life, and who is under tremendous stress of failure. He seems a lot more educated, than he is supposed to be. He appears to be too sophisticated despite his poor shaving skills, as if he dropped out of Harvard, because he was bored with Med-school, and took up fishing as a relaxing and entertaining hobby. To all those who were complaining about the screen play, their complains are valid, but for wrong reasons. People are almost rooting for Shakespearean type theater, as if these characters who are clinging to their life by their fingernails should make deep philosophical observations about human existence. They are supposed to be blue collar fishermen for crying out loud. If any thing, they were shown to be more philosophical and sophisticated than they are supposed to be. Similarly in the case of Diane Lane's character, her mannerisms are of a Hollywood super model in the beginning, and her style of talking and walking and moving etc, all seem to be of a rich movie star, and not of a poor woman who has to stress about making two ends meet. She did not seem she had led a tough life either, and was banking her hopes on a good hardworking but poor guy. However, the best and most natural character Bugsy, provided all the laughs that were necessary.James Horner did his job. Had he done a bad job, then all those who are calling it a thrill ride, and yet dumping on him, don't realize if he had failed then it would not have been a thrill ride. The photography is just absolutely fantastic. This is a kind of movie that to truly enjoy it, you have to see it in theater. Small screen would ruin this movie. Right after seeing this movie, when me and my friend walked out, we felt so great, that had it not been late on a working day, we would have gone right back in to see it again. The most amazing thing is that it is a tragedy, yet the sheer courage of brave men and women to challenge nature itself, and to look death in the eye without fear, leaves your spirits as high as the final killer wave.Don't miss this movie, or you will regret that you payed attention to those whose idea of good screen play is long slow miserable asinine dialogues.

But it just kept reminding me of Titanic and I could not help but compare the two films and it was not in favor of Perfect Storm. This movie is so derivative. And it is quite superficial at that.The scene of one of the crewmen standing on the deck holding the rails with sunset lit clouds behind him was just too much. I guess if they would've made him spread his arms and scream i'm the king of the world they would still fail to make that scene more ridiculous that it already is.The weak attempts to introduce villains to the story looked so out of place, no amount of suspension of believe will help you. In a misguided effort to make those villain characters believable, they are not even really really bad guys, they do some good things too, which ruins the whole purpose of such character in a film like that.Pretty much the same thing happens with every other element of the film. The love story, well, there are several of them, and none of them properly developed, which was probably adequate to the fact that all those stories are plain boring simple with no intrigue, yet the director feels that he has given the viewer enough to justify some really corny scenes we see in the end.Titanic was great because it has a great love story superimposed on a very realistic disaster. Note that I did not use realistic with the love story, just the disaster. Love story in Titanic was out-of-this-world fairy-tale. That fine detail is exactly what evaded the minds of the Perfect Storm creators. They pushed the concept of realism to the places which they should've left alone for the classic holywood type romance. They had such a great opportunity with the two key characters - two boat captains, imagine what a movie it could've been - sigh.But to top it all why, why James Horner did such a score. It is not that he can do only the type of music he did for Titanic. It is clearly not the case, the guy did Aliens! This was the biggest mistake. The movie has many good elements and if it was not for the music that forced me to compare two films I think I could have even enjoyed Perfect Storm.I will not rate this movie since if you manage to concentrate on the film and avoid comparisons it is quite solid film, but you are really taking a big chance here, pretty much like those fishermen did.

She was way too over the top, even for Miss Hannigan, and that's saying a lot considering it's already an over the top character. 4. The added songs.

Tomorrow is the best song of the whole show, and we, the audience, couldn't listen to it all because John Huston didn't like it. Personally, I preferred the Disney version of the film much better.

He transformed the story, which was written by David Wechter and Bruce Kimmel(by all means, check it out and see for yourself) into a screenplay.With that said, the only reason I saw this film was because I admire and respect Kevin Williamson as a writer.  But because they proclaimed everywhere From the writer of Scream & I Know What You Did Last Summer I figured it couldn't be that bad, right?  I rented it, going into the film open minded and unbiased despite the fact everyone told me how bad it was. And for once, a movie lived up to their word, and I wasn't happy to read who wrote the real story.  Faculty was bad . . .The story was very lame, predictable, trite, and ultimately, laughable. Nothing in the movie will scare you; especially the horror buffs.  The shocker isn't all that shocking since every genre has been using this gimmick for over forty years, paint a character to be sweet and innocent then make them the villain.  Maybe newcomers to the movies will be genuinely surprised.  Elijah Wood isn't quite able to act his fears (the poor writing doesn't help that), but I've seen worse . . . too bad, he was pretty good in Deep Impact.  Finally, Rodriguez . . . simply put, he's never impressed me.On the plus side, it has Robert Patrick's presence, who always makes a good villain.  Josh Hartnett proves he can actually handle acting, and not just recite lines like a zombie onscreen, it's a big step up from his performance in H20.This film receives one star from me.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, not even die hard Williamson fans.  No matter how he worked the dialogue, and calls in the script, Williamson ended up playing secretary and adding his own personal touches here and there.  But no facelift can cure the fact that script was ugly through and through, it would've been best to scrap it and start from scratch.

I think I just found out the reason why, and it is Tom Dey's new production called Shanghai Noon, an action comedy that uses routines of the road movie, the buddy comedy, slapstick parody, and probably more. The theater owners do not want audiences to realize how much time of their lives they are wasting away watching a movie as horrible as this piece of junk. You know a film is bad when you keep looking at your watch throughout its running time; you know a film is even worse when you keep looking for a watch throughout its running time, even though you know you are wearing no such time device. Shanghai Noon placed me in that vary situation. Jackie Chan is one of the most bewildering actors in business right now; I feel depressed that other countries will be subject to his film's, which come from the same beautiful United States I proudly live in today. In Shanghai Noon he once again practices his peripheral bad-taste character sketch, this time portraying an Imperial Guard named Chon Wang during 1881 in China's Forbidden City. Princess Pei Pei (Lucy Liu) has been kidnapped by her American tutor, Calvin Andrews (Jason Connery), who is working for an ex-Imperial Guard named Lo Fong (Roger Yuan), who demands a hefty ransom paid for her release. \tTo the amazement of nobody in the audience, Chon Wang is chosen to recruit the princess home. During the journey, he runs into a group of outlaws led by Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson), who eventually becomes his partner and friend. He also meets Marshall Nathan Van Cleef (Xander Berkeley), who is determined to capture and or kill Roy. \tFor the first time that I can remember in a movie featuring Jackie Chan, excluding the involving Rush Hour, the story is acute. Although the setup is a little displeasing, the movie depicts events that construct a potentially strong narrative plot line. Unfortunately, this is Jackie Chan we are talking about, and it is his martial arts comic action that turns a somewhat fortunate story into a zany, nonsensical western action picture without direction.\tNothing much occurs during the film's second act. Wang and O'Bannon make attempts to rescue the princess but only place themselves in greater danger every time. The entire middle of this movie is one unfunny comic situation after another, which would not be all that bad if the comedy was actually funny, but it is not. I never once laughed, or even cracked a smile, with the movie's desperate, contrived whimsical endeavors. \tAnother flaw in Shanghai Noon is the complete lack of character development.

I think I just found out the reason why, and it is Tom Dey's new production called Shanghai Noon, an action comedy that uses routines of the road movie, the buddy comedy, slapstick parody, and probably more. The theater owners do not want audiences to realize how much time of their lives they are wasting away watching a movie as horrible as this piece of junk. You know a film is bad when you keep looking at your watch throughout its running time; you know a film is even worse when you keep looking for a watch throughout its running time, even though you know you are wearing no such time device. Shanghai Noon placed me in that vary situation. Jackie Chan is one of the most bewildering actors in business right now; I feel depressed that other countries will be subject to his film's, which come from the same beautiful United States I proudly live in today. In Shanghai Noon he once again practices his peripheral bad-taste character sketch, this time portraying an Imperial Guard named Chon Wang during 1881 in China's Forbidden City. Princess Pei Pei (Lucy Liu) has been kidnapped by her American tutor, Calvin Andrews (Jason Connery), who is working for an ex-Imperial Guard named Lo Fong (Roger Yuan), who demands a hefty ransom paid for her release. \tTo the amazement of nobody in the audience, Chon Wang is chosen to recruit the princess home. During the journey, he runs into a group of outlaws led by Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson), who eventually becomes his partner and friend. He also meets Marshall Nathan Van Cleef (Xander Berkeley), who is determined to capture and or kill Roy. \tFor the first time that I can remember in a movie featuring Jackie Chan, excluding the involving Rush Hour, the story is acute. Although the setup is a little displeasing, the movie depicts events that construct a potentially strong narrative plot line. Unfortunately, this is Jackie Chan we are talking about, and it is his martial arts comic action that turns a somewhat fortunate story into a zany, nonsensical western action picture without direction.\tNothing much occurs during the film's second act. Wang and O'Bannon make attempts to rescue the princess but only place themselves in greater danger every time. The entire middle of this movie is one unfunny comic situation after another, which would not be all that bad if the comedy was actually funny, but it is not. I never once laughed, or even cracked a smile, with the movie's desperate, contrived whimsical endeavors. \tAnother flaw in Shanghai Noon is the complete lack of character development. We never learn anything personal about the characters; they are all one-dimensional, shallow plot puppets. I was not interested in the story simply because I did not care in the least about the characters.

Romero 1968 original black and white, Night of the Living Dead.  While not being a horror film fan per se, I was nonetheless impressed with the wide spectrum of quality footage in the production.  It ranged from awkward and mediocre to outstanding and brilliant. These varied bits could appear in a single scene, without warning. Further, the plot's devices could not all be held up to close scrutiny.Responses to this film will no doubt vary as widely, depending on how the proceedings grab one.  I can see New York Times critic Bosley Crowther's original points, being mostly turned off by the often amateurish ring to the presentation. Coming at a time when it did, who could have forseen this becoming a landmark, seminal production, re-defining the horror genre, and becoming a revered cult classic lasting into the 21st century?Yet for Night to claim these things, it has to really  have something going for it, and it does some creepy effects, genuine jolts, suspenseful moments, and horror shocks. The leading actor, the late Duane Jones, had some talent, good looks, and a fairly natural way with lines. Since he's on-screen most of the time, it's up to him to provide stabiliy to the proceedings. Although he seems to lack a little acting experience (as does the rest of the cast) what he does do is to provide the glue to Romero's uneven structure, anchoring it pretty solidly.A genuine plus for the film is an excellent sound track, brilliantly conceived and executed a superior blend of human, instrumental, and natural sound effects -- wrapped together with a fine score. Much of the editing is likewise on a high level, and the photography, while reportedly grainy in some prints, also has the reputation for high-tech fidelity in remastered versions.The film's conclusion is history-making for the genre in particular and drama in general.  Romero seems to be making more of a significant statement than might meet readily the eye. It's a work which can be deciphered many different ways, and its stark black and white photograhy assist in making this portrait a tabula rasa to which one can bring one's own horrific interpretation.Anyone for a stroll in the cemetary?
