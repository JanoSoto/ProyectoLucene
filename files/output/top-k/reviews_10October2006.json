The film looks good, sounds good, and it's still holding up not only with the passage of time but the passage of my own personal life. There are times when I pick up The Wall (the album), give it a listen and think to myself god, what a self-absorbed person this is. But I realize in my better moments that Roger Waters was just letting us in on some of his deep personal issues. I used to not understand how politics and the whole fascist angle related to the rest of the film, but at this point it all makes sense to me. Waters is saying that the walls that we build up individually in our lives to protect ourselves and separate ourselves from others are just miniature versions of the political and social walls built up by people who rule over others through fear and intimidation.On a technical level, only the scenes which integrate animation with live action have aged somewhat poorly. The film still has a striking and unique visual style, even after all these years of MTV that have followed.Geldorf is sufficient as Pink, though he doesn't get many lines or much to do except sit in that room.All in all, a great film for Floyd fans but it might leave some non fans scratching their heads, because it's a film you have to see a few times and think about if you really want to get it. I know this film was panned by a lot of critics and also a lot of them said the film's stance was insulting to the Floyd's core audience. I couldn't disagree more, I think the Floyd never made the mistake of under-estimating their audience's intelligence and that they were here making a personal statement not only about their own lives (primarily Waters' and Barrett's) but about the changes in how they interact with their fans.I agree though with Waters' comments on the documentary -- the film's great weakness is that it lacks humor, even the biting or negative humor of Floyd songs like Have a Cigar. I think possibly doing part of the film in a less documentary style, especially Young Lust would have helped here.

I must say that back then it didn't really make a powerful impression on me. I thought Hey, so this is Apocalypse Now, cool, let's move on to other stuff and leave the war for a while. Recently however, I have found the movie in the original version, and I watched it again in the soothing solitude of my household. After the credits started rolling, I was close to being awestruck. Not only has it been the most accurate movie about the Nam war I have seen in my entire life. More to that, the war story isn't the main thing going on in the movie still making it the best on its field and that is what I call a masterpiece.Like one of the users said, the entire war event is a background to a personal and yet a universally metaphorical quest, a mission to carry on, a clash of idealistic views and political reality. To me, the greatest achievement of the movie is telling the Vietnam war story beside the point, in a very unique way (as it is a tale worth telling), loosing the historical style radiating either with pathos or overgrown dread.The main plot, surprisingly, Willard's journey and his way of viewing his surroundings (evolving during the film), his attempts of understanding Kurtz and finally the act of confronting him, is far more powerful than the already strong background construction.Another really interesting thing is that Francis Ford Coppola mixed the typical war climate with an element of, well... coolness. The choppers, the napalm, the troops... what they do does now transcend beyond a mundane war assignment and turns it into a kind of ritual, in a way that viewers are bound to remember for the rest of their lives.Next, the actors. I'm very proud of Coppola and basically the 70's, 80's and the early 90's for their crew combinations of great, really great movies. Although they may not be packed with the mega stars of the current decade (if you know what I mean), the important thing is those movies' actors have merged with their parts, making them indivisible from their roles. This does not always result in a skyrocketing career, but I greatly respect lesser known actors who had played a medium role and they played it good than a superstar who had plummeted from the peak of Olympus to the pits of Hades and still remains a superstar.Sheen creates a kind of demented, wild and in the same time craving for peace, character. I believe it was a quite difficult job to do and I respect that. Duvall as the big old' USA cowboy with a liking of Wagner and the smell of napalm is an interesting and pleasant interlude. Same goes for the cracked up Dennis Hopper. The character of Kurtz however is a real cherry on the cream mountain. Those few scenes which include him or remains of his speeches, photos, history are conjured with evident mastery of storytelling. The last scenes when Brando is shown emerging, bathing in the shadowy sea, bearing the weight of existence and the burden of his actions... beautiful. Luckily, the soundtrack does also not disappoint the craving viewer. A sophisticated set of great songs which act very well on their own as well as a greater part in Coppola's production.I'm sure I'll watch Apocalypse Now a few more times in the future to ultimately memorize some speeches, gestures worthy memorizing. A very special movie, indeed one that every human being should see.

Only the repo men want his company. Then he finds himself in the mansion of forgotten screen legend Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), decked out as a memorial to someone not yet dead. Norma believes the world awaits her return (I hate that word, she says of comeback). In her effort to elude time's heartless march, she abandons sanity and bids Joe join her.Billy Wilder's film is a satire of Hollywood with a nod in the direction of Evelyn Waugh's The Loved One (Norma initially assumes Joe is here to help bury her pet chimp). As a satire it scores points, but it's as a twisted love story that it makes its mark as a cinematic masterpiece. Norma fantasizes about her comeback, but it's her love of Joe that destroys her. Everyone talks about Joe's self-loathing as a foregone conclusion of his finding himself in Norma's presence and turning himself into a gigolo, but I think he's always carrying that dislike around, his self-inflicted price for failing to achieve what he wants from life and a prison of loneliness every bit as desolate as Norma's mansion. One might wonder to what extent that, more than Norma, serves as his ruin.It's also a marvelous black comedy, both of tone and out-and-out belly laughs, whether it's Joe getting unsolicited advice in the men's clothing shop (As long as the lady is paying for it, why not take the Vicuna?) or his narrating how gentle people get with a person after he's dead. Holden's especially great in his voice-over work, letting every line stick with just the right amount of emphasis, and no hint of actorliness.Swanson's all actorliness, of course, in that magnificent way of hers which provides so much of the empathy and madcap zaniness to the film. Like Gene Wilder in Young Frankenstein, she draws you in with her amazing eyes and makes you laugh and cringe simultaneously at her most emotive outbursts. It's a comic showcase from one not known for comedy, or for working in sound.Was Norma always this affected? A glimpse of her in one of her old movies (Swanson again, in her unreleased Queen Kelly) shows a retrained, luminous presence not at all like the Norma we meet in the story. If this Norma played anyone on the silent screen, it would have more likely been Nosferatu. Just watch those hands of hers twist and pull, especially when she's drawing Joe deeper in her web.Norma doesn't mean to harm Joe. She just has no idea how real relationships work. To her, like mad Max her butler (Erich von Stroheim, a curiously shifting centerpiece whose true nature drives the point home), keeping people around is all that keeps her from a chasm of despair. When she talks to Joe, or addresses her imagined audience, it's not with the coldness of a user but real heart and soul. Unlike Garbo, she most emphatically does not want to be alone, and we can't help but like her for it.Sunset Blvd. makes a subtle, brilliant case that staving off loneliness to such a degree makes for a sickness all its own. I'm not sure whether or not that's the most depressing thing about the film, but it certainly adds to the power of its singular sting.

Everyone talks about Joe's self-loathing as a foregone conclusion of his finding himself in Norma's presence and turning himself into a gigolo, but I think he's always carrying that dislike around, his self-inflicted price for failing to achieve what he wants from life and a prison of loneliness every bit as desolate as Norma's mansion. One might wonder to what extent that, more than Norma, serves as his ruin.It's also a marvelous black comedy, both of tone and out-and-out belly laughs, whether it's Joe getting unsolicited advice in the men's clothing shop (As long as the lady is paying for it, why not take the Vicuna?) or his narrating how gentle people get with a person after he's dead. Holden's especially great in his voice-over work, letting every line stick with just the right amount of emphasis, and no hint of actorliness.Swanson's all actorliness, of course, in that magnificent way of hers which provides so much of the empathy and madcap zaniness to the film. Like Gene Wilder in Young Frankenstein, she draws you in with her amazing eyes and makes you laugh and cringe simultaneously at her most emotive outbursts. It's a comic showcase from one not known for comedy, or for working in sound.Was Norma always this affected? A glimpse of her in one of her old movies (Swanson again, in her unreleased Queen Kelly) shows a retrained, luminous presence not at all like the Norma we meet in the story. If this Norma played anyone on the silent screen, it would have more likely been Nosferatu. Just watch those hands of hers twist and pull, especially when she's drawing Joe deeper in her web.Norma doesn't mean to harm Joe. She just has no idea how real relationships work. To her, like mad Max her butler (Erich von Stroheim, a curiously shifting centerpiece whose true nature drives the point home), keeping people around is all that keeps her from a chasm of despair. When she talks to Joe, or addresses her imagined audience, it's not with the coldness of a user but real heart and soul. Unlike Garbo, she most emphatically does not want to be alone, and we can't help but like her for it.Sunset Blvd. makes a subtle, brilliant case that staving off loneliness to such a degree makes for a sickness all its own. I'm not sure whether or not that's the most depressing thing about the film, but it certainly adds to the power of its singular sting.

Modern classic is a term that gets bandied about far too loosely these days, but if there's at least one film from the last decade or so that solidly qualifies for that accolade, this is it.Both a personal memoir and a provocative story about injustice, suffering, and the depths of both depravity and compassion that can be found in the recesses of the human heart, it is the story of Paul Edgecomb, (a nearly perfect Tom Hanks), and his stint as the head prison guard, running the section of Death Row known as The Green Mile, in a penitentiary, circa the 1930's. Suffering from a severe infection that year, Paul is badly in need of a miracle when the most amazing one of all comes into his life, and the lives of the men who live - and die - on the 'Mile.' His name is John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), a gentle giant of an inmate charged with the brutal rape and murder of two little girls. The meek and passive demeanor of this man hardly seems a match for the horrible acts he's been charged with, but that's not even half the story. A spellbinding and escalating series of events take place involving John that not only changes Paul's life, but indicates that there are forces greater than ourselves that exist in the universe, and that miracles can only happen when we finally believe in them.Tales like THE GREEN MILE are the reason why I became a movie lover in the first place, and if writer\/director Frank Darabont deserved every award nod he received for his take on another Stephen King story, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, he should have won every single award for this one.And not a discouraging word can be said about this cast. Not a single actor has done work this remarkable since, but then this script and story are one of those things that comes along but once in a lifetime.Be prepared to be entertained, mesmerized and moved beyond anything you might expect from a three-hour film that makes time seem immaterial. And bring plenty of Kleenex, regardless of your gender, for one of the most unforgettable endings ever.I am more than happy to give this film IMDb's highest rating, and my highest recommendation.
