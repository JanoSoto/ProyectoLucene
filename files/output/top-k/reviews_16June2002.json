Tracy was inspired her loneliness due to without a father's love from childhood and they fall in love. To tell the truth, why Dave take the smart girl's loneliness seriously?

He's an adult, nobody could persuade him for he couldn't help in love with a teenage girl. So, what's wrong with Tracy? He's deserved it because Tracy didn't lured him from the start.

Here we have the usual major Jamesian themes European experience versus American innocence (or stupidity in the case of the merry band currently under discussion), the treachery of the human heart, and the poor young woman desperately in pursuit of her true love who, alas, does not have the one thing that she cannot live without. And by that I mean money. The true love becomes secondary in this case.The sad fact is that there is not an instance when a word coming out of the actors' mouths seems sincere-or even rehearsed. I am one who nearly always forgives a poor accent, but Jeremy Northam's attempt at Italian-accented English and Angelica Huston's Southern accent cannot meet even my low standards. The Regency aristocrat and Gangster's Moll they have previously played so successfully are much closer to their true callings.The plot is typical James (and if you haven't figured it out, James is not my favorite author)-Penniless Italian Prince (Northam) loves Penniless Heiress (Thurman) but must marry Fabulously Wealthy American Heiress (Beckensale) because her First American Billionaire and Art Collector Father (Nolte) is, well, a billionaire, and can afford to help Penniless Italian Prince fix up his run down palazzo. Now how about this for a plot twist The Penniless Heiress just happens to be the best friend of the Fabulously Wealthy American Heiress, who doesn't realize that her husband was intimate with her best friend. In the meantime, Penniless Heiress ingratiates herself to First American Billionaire and eventually becomes his wife. Things move forward predictably from there.The dialog and settings are so archly symbolic they seem almost silly. Case in point The Prince walks into a dark room where his gullible wife sits and asks, `Why are you sitting in the dark'? Soon after, the light will come on in her dim but sweet little mind. And of course, as fitting with a Merchant Ivory production, there are enough plush costumes and palatial rooms to fill up the average convention center. The gasps, significant looks, and shocked, heartbroken expressions could also fill a bushel basket. By the time the first hour was over, I looked at my watch, expecting that I had been watching for at least three hours, such was the slow pacing.Perhaps if Beckensale and Thurman had switched roles, things might have gone better, but aside from the rotten accents, Nolte looks like he would be more comfortable wearing a hardhat, flannel shirt, and jeans, perhaps leaning against the wall, drinking a beer at a San Francisco Gay Bar, talking to guys who look just like him. His modern haircut and facial hair, body language, and 20th century diction show him to be every bit as uncomfortable in the role as he must have been dressed in his evening clothes, as he was throughout the entire film. His relationship with Beckensale is just creepy, Freudian in the worst sense.It is hard to say exactly why a film like this goes wrong. Merchant Ivory hits the mark so often one expects them to come up with a near masterpiece every time.  Next time they need someone to play a broke Italian Prince, they might think about casting an English-speaking Italian.

You've got to remember that this is a movie aimed for children and, to an extent, teens. Now, I'm 14 and I enjoyed Scooby-Doo. I don't know, maybe it's just because I'm crazy for everything Matt Lillard because he's one of my favorite actors. Oh, and speaking of Matthew, he was dead-on as Shaggy. I can't express in words how awesome he was. The animated Scooby was impressive, and a few times, I actually started to believe that Scooby was a real dog...until I came back to reality. There are a few laugh-out-loud moments, but nothing to rave about. Matt stole the movie, hands down. The other performance that I liked was Linda Cardellini's Velma. She did a very good job of looking and acting like the character the way she spoke, the way she talked, and I'm impressed with the fact that she chopped off her super-long locks to have the real helmet hair. As you can probably tell, I've been telling my friends that Matthew and Linda are the best parts of the movie.A few complaints, though. Freddie Prinze Jr. as Fred? Although it wasn't a terrible casting decision, I wouldn't call it a good one either. Either he didn't do anyone research on the role as his close friend and co-star, Matt, did, or he just didn't have the knack to play the character. And can I just say that his blonde hair looked horrible. Sarah Michelle wasn't bad as Daphne and her goal to be the one who saves the day is a cute little addition. As for Shaggy's love interest, Mary Jane? I wasn't into the story. But, Matthew did a good job of making that subplot as entertaining as it could get. The actually mystery that the gang is supposed to solve made me wonder what the writers were smoking until I realized that this is Scooby-Doo and they're supposed to run into all this weird stuff. And I've got one more complaint. Two words Scrappy Doo. That idea was just out of nowhere and pure crap.Anyway, call me crazy, but I would pay to see the movie a second time, but only to see Matthew and Linda's performances again. And, again, call me crazy, I will be buying the movie when it comes out on DVD. I'd give the movie 7.5\/10 stars. If you're deciding whether to watch it, I would recommend it.

The movie grabs your attention from the beginning and doesn't let go until you see the credits. No bad press from yours truly.  Matt Damon, despite his hearthrob image, plays the amnesiac spy perfectly.  He has the confused expression down and when he fights, you get the feeling he's been doing it for years. Obviously, the use of cut shots and stunt doubles greatly increases the believability of Damon's physical prowess.  Nonetheless, Damon establishes himself as a true physical and mental actor for the first time.  And as for Franka Potente, she shines.  Insanely sexy and intricate, she pulls off a performance that just falls short of Run Lola Run.  The action sequences in the movie aren't too unique but they are well done.  The fighting is enthralling as it is violent and lacks the obvious choreography of a wire fight.  The car chase through the streets of Paris looks way too much like the thrilling car chase from Ronin but it still delivers a large punch to the middle of the movie.  One of the things that makes this movie so captivating is the on-screen chemistry of Damon and Potente.  You can feel their connection throughout the entire movie and their near topless makeout scene will make you turn your head to your signifigant other with a knowing look in your eye.All in all, i think it might become the basis for spy\/thriller\/action movies for a while.

The worst is saved for last however as the film is saddled with the most pathetic final showdown I have seen in a movie for quite awhile, with zero suspense and barely any action. Not what you want from a super-hero movie. Finally, to add insult to injury, Sam Raimi sees fit to end the film with a romantic scene so bad that it makes Attack of the Clones' romance seem positively Shakespearean. A mediocre movie at best.

Most were waged on                               small pieces of coral real estate where numbingly brutal carnage took place. No quarter was asked for or given and                               tactics for both sides essentially meant repetitive and costly frontal assaults. Maneuver was irrelevant.                              Three major campaigns involving relatively significant land areas - Saipan, Okinawa and the re-taking of the                               Philippines - provided the opportunity for maneuver based upon exploiting battlefield intelligence. While victory was                               never in doubt in these campaigns, minimizing casualties and ending operations as quickly as possible was only                               possible through well-coordinated all-services operations.                              Windtalkers brings to the screen what the Department of Defense maintained as classified information until 1968 -                               the role of Navajos serving in the Marine Corps who relayed front line information to artillery batteries, warships and                               tactical air assets by radio in their native language. Lacking most of the words that described the panoply of                               death-dealing ordnance, the Native American Marines came up with neologisms that permitted accurate information to                               be swiftly and succinctly transmitted.                              Windtalkers is the celluloid monument to these brave Marines who voluntarily joined the Corps, most coming from                               reservations and life experiences that hardly supported the intense patriotism these men showed. Their role was                               important although arguably less so than as depicted in the movie.                              Fearful that a captured windtalker would give away the unique code if captured, each was assigned a Marine                               bodyguard.  In the film the bodyguard is charged with killing his Navajo windtalker, something that survivors claim was never part of the operation.                              Nicholas Cage, in his second World War II movie since his foolish role as the Puccini-loving Captain Corelli (Captain                               Corelli's Mandolin), gives a vivid and intense performance as Sergeant Joe Enders, a man who found a home in the                               Corps before the war. Already blooded and wounded - physically and emotionally - by earlier fighting he is ordered                               to be the minder for Private Ben Yahzee, well played by Adam Beach.                              A great deal of fighting follows, actually too much. A bit of judicious editing would have removed some of the battle                               scenes that by their repetitiveness numbs rather than impresses. While the theme of the film - the belated recognition of                               Navajos in a unique role - is new to the screen, Windtalkers follows closely in the wake of many World War II                               movies and especially those honoring the Marine Corps. Enders is much more sensitive than John Wayne in The                               Sands of Iwo Jima but he's a noncom any filmgoer has seen many, many times.                              Enders's squad also reflects the usual cinematic re-creation of a combat unit. Italian, Greek, Irish - from the East and                               the West Coast - everyone is here (except, curiously the almost ubiquitous war movie token Jew). As to personalities,                               yep, there's that big time bigot, the guy who loves kids, the fellow who misses his wife so much, the would-be                               post-war local tycoon.                              But the movie works. And it works because it matters that a film shows THIS generation the power, decency and                               most of all raw courage and determination of World War II fighters. The Marines may be the almost exclusive                               combatants here but service members of all the forces are reflected in the heroism and humanity shown here. Director                               John Woo has given a gift of love to his adopted country and I say thanks.                              Before the end titles rolled I would have liked to see a screen telling viewers that many Indians served in the Pacific                               and not only as windtalkers (this is mentioned in one passing sentence in the film). It would also have been nice to tell                               (not remind, in all likelihood) folks that Native American combat veterans returned, in the main, to reservations in                               worse shape than much of the conquered Axis territory, to an indifferent and even hostile public and government, to                               little hope and too much alcohol. But I guess I may want too much.                              I don't understand why this film's release was held up because of 11 September. The uncomplicated but powerful                               patriotism of Windtalkers would have been as accepted - and more importantly, needed - then as it is now.                              James Horner scored the film and the music is ridiculously intrusive. Can't Hollywood trust viewers to be gripped by                               scenes of desperate combat without a boring score accompanying banzai charges?

One of the biggest problems with Windtalkers is that John Woo tried to combine a real, life-like war movie, with his standard brand of extravagant explosions and amazing gun fights.  Those two combinations don't mix.  While you are watching, you get the feeling that Woo wanted to put in choreographed gunfights that make your jaw drop, but cut short of amazing you in order to capture the realism of war (despite the large amount of shots coming from rifles with only 5 or 6 shots in the bandolier).  The worst part of the movie is that it never grabbed my attention.  I couldn't keep my eyes glued to the screen like i did with The Bourne Identity.Other than those facts, the movie was good.  The story was a bit stagnant and didn't flow too well but the acting more than made up for it.  Nic Cage played the part of the reluctant hero who doesn't care about anything but making up for his screw up perfectly.  You believe that he is really ready to die.  Adam Beach did very well as the Navaho code-talker who has a sort of naivety about his situation until Cage kills his fellow code-talker as part of his orders (Beach goes war-nuts at this point and becomes a psycho soldier hell bent on revenge...muy believable).All in all, it is a good night at the movie but i doubt it will go down as one of the best war movies ever.

Adam Beach did very well as the Navaho code-talker who has a sort of naivety about his situation until Cage kills his fellow code-talker as part of his orders (Beach goes war-nuts at this point and becomes a psycho soldier hell bent on revenge...muy believable).All in all, it is a good night at the movie but i doubt it will go down as one of the best war movies ever.  Unfortunately, John Woo has never made a movie better than the classic Hard-Boiled but he is getting close.

Years have passed since the wave of murders happened in the re-opening of camp Crystal Lake, and this time a group of counselors have decided to re-open the camp for summer. Sounds like it's a good idea, but is it really? Hell yeah! That is fun for Jason, and for us.*Minor Spoilers* The virgin (?) heroine for this movie is Amy Steel (Ginny), a young psycologist and counselor. In contrast of Adrienne King (Alice, ,the first Friday the 13th heroine), Ginny knows how to deal with Jason as she's beware of the legend that states that Jason is wandering in Crystal Lake since he saw his mother being decapitated. We have a heroine, and this movie states that there has to be a male survivor character in any horror movie. This time John Furey (Paul) is the male survivor, and he will give a little battle to Jason. The teens in this movie are not as dumb as in the next Friday movies, well only half of them. Half of the teens (the smart ones) decide to sneak in the town and have fun going to a bar, the other half (the dumb! teens) decide to stay in the house to have sex and later being impaled, take a walk in the woods, or just hang out in the house.Well, the legend plays an important part here because Ginny is kinda worried about that human being called Jason. She was in the bar, but after thinking about Jason she decided to return to the house, of course with Paul. When they return they find that everybody in the house has been murdered, and before they could get the hell out of the house, they find guess who? in the house. Well, that leads us to the best chase in the Friday the 13th movies as Jason runs after Ginny stopping at his home. Expect a great, mind twisting ending where Ginny demonstrates why she is the smartest heroine in this movies.*No More Spoilers* Friday the 13th part 2 is a great sequel, it's primitive, creepy, and scary as we suspect of Jason doing the crimes but we are sure about that until he shows up. Great acting, great score, and creepy settings (specially the Voorhees house) make this movie a classic because it's the first movie where Jason appears and does the nasty job. RECOMMENDED!
