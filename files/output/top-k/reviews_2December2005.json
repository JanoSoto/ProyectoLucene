[{"date":"2 December 2005","score":"441 out of 582 people found the following review useful","review":" Writing a review of The Matrix is a very hard thing for me to do because this film means a lot to me and therefore I want to do the film justice by writing a good review. To tell the truth the first time I saw the film I was enamored by the effects. I remember thinking to myself that this was one of the most visually stunning films I had ever seen in my life. Also having always been a comic book fan and a fan of films that were larger than life, the transitional element of the story was very appealing to me and this probably heightened my enjoyment of the film very much. It wasn't until some time later (and after having seen the film a few times more) that I started to think about the film. I recognized the Christian elements quite quickly but it wasn't until I wrote an actual 15-page essay on the film that I tapped into some of the philosophical and religious elements and that made me appreciate the film even more. I won't say that I have recognized all elements because the film is quite literally packed with them.Acting wise the film works excellently. I won't say that there aren't any issues because there are but overall the acting is pretty flawless. Keanu Reeves plays the main character, Neo, or Thomas A. Anderson and while he is not the perfect actor I think he does a pretty good job in The Matrix (and the sequels). He doesn't have the longest of lines which was probably a deliberate choice from the directors and it works because this gives him a better opportunity to work on posture and facial expressions and I must say that overall his body language is very good. Very clear and well defined. Laurence Fishbourne plays Neo's mentor Morpheus and he does an excellent job of it. His lines flow with a certain confidence and style that makes his character somewhat unique and interesting. Carrie-Anne Moss does a good job as well and succeeds in looking both cool and sexy in her leather outfit. Joe Pantoliano, a critically underrated actor does a brilliant job of bringing his character, Cypher, to life. I can't say much about him because his character is pretty essential to the plot and I certainly don't wan't to spoil it for anyone. Gloria Foster appears in a relatively small role that will have greater significance in the following films and she does a very good job. The best acting is provided by Hugo Weaving, however, in his portrayal of Agent Smith. It is really something to watch him act out the changes in his character. Agent Smith gains some human traits like anger, sense of dread, hate and eventually even a sly sense of humor (mostly in the sequels). Two thumbs way up to Weaving who has created one of the finest screen villains of all time.Effects wise the film is simply stunning and it deservedly was awarded the Oscar for best effects (and was regrettably cheated out of a nomination in the Best Film category) ahead of even Star Wars. The reason that I think The Matrix deserves the Oscar for best effects is simply that the effects in The Matrix are more innovative than the ones in Star Wars. Just take a look at how many times the effects have been spoofed and you'll probably agree. The effects also help in the symbolism of the film and in creating a very dystopian atmosphere not unlike the one seen in Blade Runner and this works brilliantly. The film looks beautiful at all times and today 6 years later (my God has it already been 6 years?) the effects still hold their ground against new science fiction films. Add the effects to the brilliant editing and you have a visual masterpiece on your hands. Very well done.The reason that I think The Matrix is more reviewable than pretty much any other film is the story and the philosophical and religious elements of the story because with every viewing I catch something I didn't see the previous time I watched it. Without spoiling the film I think I can mention a few of the more obvious elements. Obviously the film draws on the Messiah myth as Neo is a clear reference to Jesus with the analogy of his name (Neo = one, as in The One) but also hidden in his other name, Thomas A. Anderson. The first part of his last name, Anderson comes from the Greek Andros meaning man and combine this with the second part of his last name son and add a little creativity you will come up with the combination son of man which was a title Jesus came up with about himself. Also the first time we meet Neo a man calls him (and I quote) You're my Saviour man. My own personal Jesus Christ. It doesn't get any more obvious than that. Aside from the Christianic elements the film also gets its inspiration from Budhism, Gnosticism (Gnosis = knowledge) but is also inspired by Plato and his analogy of the Cave and Jean Baudrillard's essay, Simulacra and Simulations. Explaining these elements would make this review go on forever so aside from mentioning them I will not comment on them further.To all the people who doubt the profound nature of The Matrix I can only give one advice Free your mind and watch the film again. You won't regret it. If I had to choose a favorite all time film my choice would probably fall on either The Matrix (obviously I don't expect people to agree but if they do thats great) or The Lord of the Rings The Return of the King and I recommend it to all fans of sci-fi and people who like philosophy.10\/10 - on my top 3 of best films.

Also, perhaps I'm not even entitled to write this review because I could only stand to watch the first hour of the movie before deciding to turn it off. Unbelievable? Let me explain why. This movie is perhaps one of the most touted films of all time and I had not seen it despite the movie having been around for over 20 years. So, one day, I finally decided to watch the thing and bore patiently through each boring scene after another. I'm a fan of science fiction but now I realize not in the sense of a connoisseur but just a guy who likes a good blend of action, drama, science, fiction and acting. This movie arguably has all of those things but is achingly slow in presenting them. It cannot escape looking every bit like a 1982 vision of what the future would be like and suffers too much from being implemented from an arty angle. The scenes are too dark for Harrison Ford's charms (he could easily have been replaced with someone else who didn't have Indiana Jones behind him) and the characters are much too deep to bother even trying to understand. The philosophical angle doesn't impress me either. There are many 'big questions' movies can deal with without making the audience itself lie on the couch. I suppose the last 40 minutes or so of the film might have been better and tied up some loose ends but I could not stand to waste any more time watching it. Looking at other movies from the same era which I still find very interesting - Conan The Barbarian, Indiana Jones and Alien - I'm disappointed to say that Blade Runner could have been better. Anyway, I will shoulder part of the blame because I didn't watch it to the end and perhaps because technology is moving at light speed these days, philosophical science fiction movies really look much, much older than they ought to.

Chopping Mall was made right in the middle of all that, when horror movies were still in between small budgets and big budgets.Our movie begins in a shopping mall that has just gotten a new security system three lethal robots that can fight back against robbers. Late at night, a group of teenagers that work in the mall decide to stay there after closing hours so they can have the mall all to themselves for a romantic night. But, something goes wrong. The new security robots end up going crazy and start killing everybody in sight.This movie has all of the qualities that you need in order to enjoy a cheesy 80s flick quite a bit of female nudity, (including a breast shot of Barbara Crampton from Stuart Gordon's classic film RE-ANIMATOR) bad acting, wacky music, and some nice but quick shots of gore and violence. Because of the fact that this movie has sci-fi elements to it, it has a bunch of horrible looking CGI laser effects that are so bad that they are good.The writing and direction isn't as bad as you would think. There are some movies from the 80s that are so terrible that you can't help but love them. This isn't one of them. You can actually sit back and enjoy Chopping Mall as a horror film, but you can't set your expectations too high. You will also want to keep in mind that it isn't suppose to be a horror film all the way around. It is meant to be a horror\/sci fi\/ action flick.Fans of old 80s horror movies will enjoy the cast of actors in this film, which include Barbara Crampton from Re-Animator, Kelli Maroney from the crime film Slayground, Tony O'Dell from Evils Of The Night, Russell Todd from Friday The 13th Part 2, and Karrie Emerson who is also from Evils Of The Night. Even Dick Miller came through the give a quick cameo. (This movie was produced by Roger Corman, after all.) The special effects by Robert Short are cool, but unfortunately most of them were chopped down to quick cuts, therefore leaving most of it in the dark.

On a casual viewing, All About Eve may seem like an unlikely candidate for great film status it's not epic in scope, it's not even about any big issue, and, Davis aside, it's not full of above-title stars. But each time I watch it, I'm more impressed with how rich a movie it is. It's perhaps the one film I've seen that comes the closest to being able to do what a novel can do develop full, psychologically complex characters whose inner thoughts you can read, even though they're never (or rarely) directly stated. This film is a monument to screen acting. Not one actor hits a wrong note (though Baxter is occasionally over the top). And the writing is as sharp as writing ever gets, with one quotable line after another firing off the lips of the actors without giving the audience a chance to catch its breath.Even though it's about the theatre, one has to believe that Eve is really more about Hollywood and the business of film making. A group of show biz veterans who helped the art form grow up have to sit back and watch the business taken over by a younger set with ideas of their own. Never before have I seen assembled for a film a cast with more chemistry than the one here; it practically makes the screen sizzle whenever all of them are on it together.All About Eve is a totally adult, fairly cynical film produced at a time when many films felt it necessary to tack on hokey happy endings no matter how unbelievable they might be, or spell out the film's message with a bullhorn and a neon sign for an audience the film makers obviously didn't think were savvy enough to get the message on their own. Come to think of it, Eve stands apart from the majority of films released today that are still being made for the lowest common denominator.

On a casual viewing, All About Eve may seem like an unlikely candidate for great film status it's not epic in scope, it's not even about any big issue, and, Davis aside, it's not full of above-title stars. But each time I watch it, I'm more impressed with how rich a movie it is. It's perhaps the one film I've seen that comes the closest to being able to do what a novel can do develop full, psychologically complex characters whose inner thoughts you can read, even though they're never (or rarely) directly stated. This film is a monument to screen acting. Not one actor hits a wrong note (though Baxter is occasionally over the top). And the writing is as sharp as writing ever gets, with one quotable line after another firing off the lips of the actors without giving the audience a chance to catch its breath.Even though it's about the theatre, one has to believe that Eve is really more about Hollywood and the business of film making. A group of show biz veterans who helped the art form grow up have to sit back and watch the business taken over by a younger set with ideas of their own.

I was 11 and had no life except sports and particularly nerf football. But that's beside the point. I went to an alternative school with alternative kids;this means your hanging out with different kids. Well,one day playing this sad sport there was a kid who didn't speak,just looked,with this composed face. He was deaf. They made fun of him,but he helped us win the game. Somehow I got the courage to try and communicate to him that he was cool. We agreed on seeing a movie. He said time bandits in a warbled but cognicent way. I was afraid of those trailers;you had to be an outcast or something to see that scary film. But we met up at the theatre in berkeley,and once the movie started it became apparent that this was a special film. No,a really,really,COOL film! Scary at times,but interesting as OG would say. I couldn't believe how captivating this film was,and once it hit cable I even taped the film with a tape deck. The dialogue and acting and execution of everything made it believable in the sense you could be saved by a fantasy film like this and not capitulate to the American materialism that has imbued all art from every perspective. Once the 70's were over the 80's was a last hurrah or boo,depending if you enjoyed the 80's. The only way to make another film like this is to follow the old concepts.

In high school, he began making short films with his best friend Bruce Campbell, and his brother Ted Raimi. Then, when Sam Raimi was 19, he decided that he wanted to make a legit full-length horror film.Raimi wrote a short screenplay titled WITHIN THE WOODS, and got Bruce, Ted, and a couple of other friends to act in it. Raimi then wrote a full-length screenplay, which would be very similar to the short film. Raimi and his friend\/producer Rob Tapert began showing the short movie to investors to try to get them to fund the full-length movie. After lots of hard work, they finally raised the money, and in December of 1979, Sam Raimi, now 20-years-old, began filming THE EVIL DEAD.The Evil Dead begins with Ash, his girlfriend Linda, and his sister Cheryl, his best friend Scotty, and Scotty's girlfriend Shelly. The five of them have rented a cabin out in the woods where they plan to spend a peaceful weekend. When they get there, they find a book that is made out of flesh and inked in blood. They also find a strange tape recorder, and when they play it, the voice on it translated the codes written within the book. This awakens evil demon spirits, which end up attacking the souls of the people that are inside of the cabin.There are two reasons why so many horror movies were released into theatres in the 1980s The first reason is Friday The 13th and the second is The Evil Dead. These two movies which were shot on really low budgets made back so much money that all of the producers all over the world were anxious to make a quick, low budget horror movie and get them onto the big screen ASAP. But, no matter how many great low budget flicks those producers and companies popped out, none of them managed to be quite as great as The Evil Dead.First off, this movie is one of the scariest movies ever made. Watching this movie in the dark is enough to give even the most hardcore horror fans the chills. All of the actors in this movie were amazing and it is sad to see that most of them didn't go on to do anything else, accept for Bruce Campbell, who is now a cult horror star, and Ellen Sandweise, who has done a little bit since then, but not much. She is going to be in the new movie Satan's Playground.The special done by Tom Sullivan are nothing less then amazing. They are indeed low budget style special effects, but they are brilliant nonetheless. The lighting is scary and great, and the setting of the cabin and the woods is very, very creepy. The music fits the done perfectly, and finally the writing and direction by Sam Raimi is perfect. This ENTIRE MOVIE is perfect. Ten stars out of ten.Raimi went onto direct the extremely high grossing Spider Man movies and is now extremely rich and famous. All we can hope for now is that one of these new, young directors will follow in his foot steps and make the next great low budget horror movie, so we can start getting more great horror movies in theatres again.
