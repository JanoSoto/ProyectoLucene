[{"date":"18 November 2009","score":"5 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" The Iron Giant was a beautiful, funny and touching movie, that is one of the best non-Disney animated movies I have seen along with The Prince of Egypt, The Secret of NIMH, Watership Down and Castle of Cagliostro. There wasn't a single thing I hated about the movie, for me it was outstanding on every level. The animation was absolutely gorgeous, with stunning colourful backgrounds and brilliant character animation especially on the Iron Giant himself. The music by Michael Kamen was consistently excellent, and never overpowered the story. In fact at times it even enhanced the drama. And the film has a beautiful message not to mention a sweet story. The characters were delightful, Hogarth isn't annoying at all and the Iron Giant isn't scary in the slightest. Strictly speaking he has to be one of the most gentle and poignant characters in an animated film. There are plenty of effective scenes like the explosive climax and the scene with the dead deer is a real tear jerker. I will admit I was worried initially when I saw the voice cast, but everybody involved did a superb job. Jennifer Aniston and Harry Connick Jnr were perfect, in their most understated performances. Both get stick about being untalented, but for me their vocal contributions in this film suggests otherwise, while Christopher MacDonald almost steals the film as the FBI agent. Eli Marienthal is very sweet and likable as Hogarth too, and watch out for John Mahoney and Cloris Leachman. All in all, an outstanding film, that if you mind me saying so is the best animated film of 1999 and one of the best films of that year too. I may be wrong but I do think it is highly underrated on IMDb. 10\/10 Bethany Cox ","genre":null},{"date":"18 November 2009","score":"5 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" The Iron Giant was a beautiful, funny and touching movie, that is one of the best non-Disney animated movies I have seen along with The Prince of Egypt, The Secret of NIMH, Watership Down and Castle of Cagliostro.

Maybe when I was 8, when White Christmas was on every year, I wasn't as into musicals as I am now, save movies like Annie, Wizard of Oz and Oliver! I am truly sorry, for this was an excellent film, that is perfect for the Christmas holiday season. White Christmas looks lovely, shot in beautiful Vista Vision with nice cinematography and wonderful costumes. The red dresses in the reprise of White Christmas especially were to die for. The songs and score by Irving Berlin is outstanding; the title song White Christmas is not only one of my all time favourite Christmas songs but also one of my favourite songs ever in a musical. But the other songs go without fault too, particularly The Best Things Happen When You're Dancing and Sisters.The script and story, serving as a partial remake of Holiday Inn, are top notch, if a little fluffy and implausible in places. Even better were the performances, with Bing Crosby his usual charming self as Bob, and while weak at the start Danny Kaye is superb as Phil. His dance routine with Vera Ellen, who looked gorgeous here and sang and danced a dream, was a knockout. Rosemary Clooney is positively riveting as Betty as well, in a suitably calm and subdued performance. I have to say I loved the choreography, it was clever, fast-paced and energetic. Overall, it may be fluff and a tad schmaltzy, but it is an excellent and timeless holiday movie. 10\/10 Bethany Cox ","genre":null},{"date":"18 November 2009","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I can not believe that I did not see this movie before now.

In screenplay form, it's really a mediocre film with a lot of flaws. But the six main characters, particularly Billy the Kid, are played so well and with such energy and charm by the cast, that it strangely enough makes the whole movie work.For those unfamiliar with the movie, Young Guns is yet another retelling of the story of Billy the Kid, the infamous Old West outlaw rumored to have killed twenty-one men within twenty-one years. And out of all the versions I have seen, this is my personal favorite. Historical inaccuracies plague the story, but communicates enough to basically tell what happened, how Billy the Kid was taken in off the streets by an English landowner (Terence Stamp) and then sought revenge after his caretaker's land feud-induced murder.The primary reason this movie works is because of, what I think is really an Oscar-caliber performance by Emilio Estevez as Billy the Kid. Estevez is brilliant in portraying the stereotypical idea of Billy the Kid as a short-tempered, maniacal trigger-happy but oddly enough charming and charismatic killer. He just has an uncanny way of zeroing in on his otherwise mundane lines to generate the personality of a half-insane shootist all too ready to crack a joke along with a gunshot, even if it only amuses himself. Supporting him are his real-life brother Charlie Sheen, Lou Diamond Phillips, Kiefer Sutherland, Dermot Mulroney, and Casey Siemaszko, all of whom are very young here and very good in their roles.With a less enthusiastic cast, Young Guns might not have been anything special because again, its screenplay is highly imperfect. There really isn't any depth to any character besides Billy the Kid and as a result, the characters other than the outlaws are rather a bit impersonal. Jack Palance's character of L.G. Murphy is well-played by the late great actor, but shallow in terms of impact. And the friendship between Billy the Kid and a lawyer played by Terry O'Quinn is really just used as a plot-mover. And there is also a very tired and uninteresting subplot involving a romance between Sutherland and a Chinese girl which merely fills time.Nevertheless, the movie works because of very strong and magnetic performances, some explosive and gritty action scenes, and a brisk running time. I've yet to see a perfect film version of the story of Billy the Kid and I hope there will one day be one, but as for now, this is the best I've seen and certainly the most charismatic and enthusiastic way that the outlaw has been played.

I thought it was a very entertaining film, without taking itself too seriously. It was funny, intelligent and creative. What I mean by that, is that there is something for adults and older children as well as young kids. There was a fun script, that was intelligent and funny without being too artificial, and the direction from Robert Rodriguez was surprisingly effective. The plot is original, the thumb people were great fun, the action was fast-paced, the scenery was lovely and the special effects and stunts are splendid. And the soundtrack was awesome. The acting was very good, with Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara spirited in the two leads and their constant bickering was a delight. Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino have fun as the parents, while Alan Cumming and Tony Shalhoub come close to stealing the film as Floop and Minion. The film also has a nice message; my only complaints are the rather over-emphasised ending, and I did feel that Cheech Marin and Danny Trejo didn't have enough screen time to shine properly but I did enjoy their brief appearances.

I didn't think the movie was that bad. It is flawed in a lot of ways, but there is some fun embedded in the film. I am stuck on whether it is better than the 1994 movie or inferior. If I were to be picky, I would say better in some areas, inferior in others. My main flaws were with the script and some of the plot. The script is weak in places, but has some funny moments, mainly with the little green alien. The plot I think is stronger than the one in the 1994 movie, but slower in pace and does suffer from one or two hasty and over-familiar subplots like Chip stealing Wilma's necklace and framing Fred. I liked it though that it detailed of how Fred and Wilma met, and the scene at the bowling area was sweet with the Nutcracker serving as background music. Mark Addy looks more the part of Fred than John Goodman, but I felt that he slightly underplayed, and I did find Stephen Baldwin too tall and too gormless as Barney. However, Kristen Johnson is wonderfully voluptuous as Wilma and Jane Krakowski, what can I say, better than Rosie O'Donnell. As much as I like O'Donnell, she wasn't quite right for Betty in the 1994 film, Krakowski was perfect. In terms of supporting actors, Alan Cumming is amusing as Mick Jagged and even better as Gazoo and Joan Collins is a sheer delight as Pearl. Thomas Gibson has his moments as Chip. The soundtrack is great, and the scenery, costumes and design of Dino were spot on. Plus that little alien is cute, and the dance routine at the end was lots of fun.

Now, twenty some years later, his Fast Eddie Felson is driving around in a big fancy Cadillac selling liquor and stake-horsing younger pool players. One day, while romancing his bartender girlfriend, his young protégé (John Tuturro) gets whipped by this cocky kid named Vincent. Eddie Felson is immediately drawn to the flaky, loud-mouthed kid with the name Vince stenciled on his tee shirt. After some arm twisting and manipulating, Eddie, Vincent, and Vincent's streetwise girlfriend Carmen (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) are making their way to Atlantic City where a 9 Ball pool tournament awaits. Along they way Eddie tries to teach them how to hustle pool. This will be a problem because of course the cocky youngster won't do as he's told. He has a gift and knows it. It is simply impossible for him to hold back and let someone beat him. Even when it could lead to a bigger payoff down the road. His girlfriend Carmen also seems to see both Vincent and Eddie as a way to make money for herself. She is clearly a woman with motives all her own. Of course this will all lead up to a climatic match in Atlantic City between the old master and the young protégé, won't it? Well, it appears to for a moment, until we learn that what we saw wasn't really what it appeared to be.And that's the part of the film that seemed to really irk Roger Ebert in his review. He was expecting a masterpiece of a film for no other reason than Martin Scorcese is the director. But the film isn't a masterpiece. Its simply a very good film with some great performances, great music, and some gritty and authentic-looking locations. Who is the better pool player is the last thing this film is about. This is a film about people using other people. Be it for money, inspiration, comfort, you name it. Newman plays Felson here as a gruff, seasoned man who thinks he knows everything about the game, and those who play it. He finds out as the film moves along that is not always the case. Sometimes these younger players have new tricks up their sleeves, and if you let your guard down, they will hustle even the smartest old timer. There is a classic scene where Eddie, after a few too many drinks, allows a chubby and apparently dim-witted Forest Whitaker to take him for hundreds of dollars. The film is full of scenes that end in ways you don't quite expect.This is one of those movies where above all else, the casting was almost perfect. Newman is as watchable as ever. Mastrantonio steals a few scenes. Cruise is annoying of course, but he was supposed to be. Still, he looks kind of weak compared to the other actors. Great support from Helen Shaver and Bill Cobbs, too. Watch closely for an appearance from music icon Iggy Pop. During a montage, Cruise hustles him and then steals a shot of booze right out of his hand! The cinematography from Michael Ballhaus is great as always. In fact its too good! Some of the camera shots just look too stylish for such a film. Maybe that was Scorcese's way of trying to liven up a picture with so little violence! Overall, The Color of Money is worth your time. 8 of 10 stars.The Hound ","genre":null},{"date":"18 November 2009","score":"12 out of 15 people found the following review useful","review":" The Color of Money is a slick sequel to The Hustler where Paul Newman as a much younger man paid the price for hustling pool.

His girlfriend Carmen also seems to see both Vincent and Eddie as a way to make money for herself. She is clearly a woman with motives all her own.

Well, it appears to for a moment, until we learn that what we saw wasn't really what it appeared to be.And that's the part of the film that seemed to really irk Roger Ebert in his review. He was expecting a masterpiece of a film for no other reason than Martin Scorcese is the director. But the film isn't a masterpiece. Its simply a very good film with some great performances, great music, and some gritty and authentic-looking locations. Who is the better pool player is the last thing this film is about. This is a film about people using other people. Be it for money, inspiration, comfort, you name it. Newman plays Felson here as a gruff, seasoned man who thinks he knows everything about the game, and those who play it. He finds out as the film moves along that is not always the case. Sometimes these younger players have new tricks up their sleeves, and if you let your guard down, they will hustle even the smartest old timer. There is a classic scene where Eddie, after a few too many drinks, allows a chubby and apparently dim-witted Forest Whitaker to take him for hundreds of dollars. The film is full of scenes that end in ways you don't quite expect.This is one of those movies where above all else, the casting was almost perfect. Newman is as watchable as ever. Mastrantonio steals a few scenes. Cruise is annoying of course, but he was supposed to be. Still, he looks kind of weak compared to the other actors. Great support from Helen Shaver and Bill Cobbs, too. Watch closely for an appearance from music icon Iggy Pop.

Now, twenty some years later, his Fast Eddie Felson is driving around in a big fancy Cadillac selling liquor and stake-horsing younger pool players. One day, while romancing his bartender girlfriend, his young protégé (John Tuturro) gets whipped by this cocky kid named Vincent. Eddie Felson is immediately drawn to the flaky, loud-mouthed kid with the name Vince stenciled on his tee shirt. After some arm twisting and manipulating, Eddie, Vincent, and Vincent's streetwise girlfriend Carmen (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) are making their way to Atlantic City where a 9 Ball pool tournament awaits.

Hinton's classic novel for young people has become a classic motion picture as well. The Outsiders with its all star cast of budding young Brat Packers reminds me a lot of the studio system films from days of yore. Francis Ford Coppola could never have afforded to pay all the players when they entered their prime earnings years which would be not to long in the future. Ironic that the biggest name in this film, Tom Cruise, has the smallest role in The Outsiders.The main character of the film is C. Thomas Howell who is the youngest of three brothers who are orphaned with oldest Patrick Swayze raising his siblings as best he can. The middle brother is Rob Lowe. All of them are from the wrong side of the tracks of their small Oklahoma town and are just referred to as 'greasers' or 'hoods'.In the pecking order above them are the upper middle class kids, preppies or jocks who are referred to as 'Sosh'. We never do find out exactly what the origin of the name was, probably it's in the novel. But the Soshs look down on the greasers and the greasers resent the soft life of privilege they see the other group apparently has. It's a dividing line they don't cross.When Howell's best friend Ralph Macchio kills Leif Garrett trying to save Howell from Garrett and his friends trying to drown him, the two boys have to run away. The film follows them on their journey which contains both tragedy, but also a realization that life isn't just made up of greasers and Soshs.Besides those already mentioned Matt Dillon and Emilio Estevez are also greasers in good standing. Dillon has a key role in the film as kind of a mentor greaser to the younger kids like Macchio and Howell. Watching The Outsiders takes me back to my youth when I was doing basic training for the Army Reserve. I saw so many kids like the greasers in basic training for a hitch in the real army. This is exactly where the military gets a lot of its recruits, kids like the greasers who have no real life and look to get away from kind of situation all the greaser kids are in.Francis Ford Coppola got perfect performances from his cast of budding stars. My favorite has to be Ralph Macchio as Johnny Cade. He's a kid from an abusive home who seeks acceptance and identity with the gang, he envies C. Thomas Howell for at least having the two older brothers. His scene with Howell where he sobs and wishes for a world without greasers or Soshs is a poignant heartbreaker.

Such a film was 1973's 'The Wicker Man', scripted by Anthony Shaffer ( author of 'Sleuth' ) and directed by Robin Hardy. The legend goes that when British Lion boss Michael Deeley saw an early version he hated it so much he cut it to ribbons and to this day no-one knows where the missing footage went. But its popularity grew through word of mouth.I first saw it in 1988 when it was shown on B.B.C.-2 as part of 'Moviedrome', a series devoted to cult films hosted by Alex Cox. From the opening ( a poor quality clip of Sgt.Neil Howie praying in church ) I was hooked. Howie flies to the remote Scottish island of Summerisle, to investigate a complaint concerning the apparent disappearance of a little girl named Rowan Morrison. Right from the word go, he senses something is up. The locals stare at him as though he has stepped off a spaceship. He finds that Christianity is only taught in the local school as a comparative religion, and that the inhabitants are Pagan. Children dance naked round fires, couples fornicate in public places, penis-shaped trees are all over the place, the locals sing ribald songs about Willow McGregor ( Britt Ekland ), the buxom daughter of the landlord of the inn where Howie is staying.When Howie confronts Lord Summerisle ( Christopher Lee ), he expresses astonishment at finding a place so steeped in Paganism he can barely believe it exists in the 20th century. He continues his investigations, but the locals prove obstinate. Finally, he discovers what happened to young Rowan, and the answer has horrifying repercussions for him personally...That is all I want to tell you of the plot. Watch the film for yourself. Edward Woodward, who sadly died two days ago, is simply brilliant as 'Sgt.Howie', a God-fearing policeman determined to carry out his duties despite being led down wrong paths. In a particularly memorable scene, he is in bed while a naked Willow pounds on the wall next door, tempting him. Many men would not be able to resist her ( me included! ), but his faith keeps him pure. Also good is Christopher Lee as 'Lord Summerisle', a role far removed from 'Count Dracula'. He is charming and sinister. Diane Cilento and Ingrid Pitt give Ekland competition in the looks department.Fans of 'Rab C.Nesbitt' should keep an eye peeled for a young Barbara 'Ella' Rafferty and Tony 'Jamesie Cotter' Roper in small roles.The whole film is superbly written and shot, getting its 'scares' from atmosphere and mood, rather than blood and gore. Another of its strengths is Paul Giovanni's folk music. The final scene apparently terrified Woodward when he filmed it, and it is not hard to see why. It makes an incredibly powerful climax to this motion picture.'The Wicker Man' has often been described as a pro-Pagan film. I do not agree. It is apparent that the inhabitants of Summerisle are wasting their time by worshipping their gods, just as Sgt.Howie's faith in his ultimately serves him no good. It is anti-religious if anything. I do not really regard it as a horror film either ( only one person dies in the whole movie ). It is more of a mystery.Forget the pointless Nicolas Cage remake and watch this instead.

Gone With the Wind was shot entirely in gorgeous technicolor; the scene of the fire in Atlanta required the use of all eight technicolor cameras in existence at the time.I've never seen such a kind of classic film. The scenery and photography is possibly the most superb ever done in the history of film. Many scenes are just sumptuously lit and filmed. The gripping nighttime escape from Atlanta (the whole city seemingly in flames) is one of the most spectacular action sequences ever done. The sunsets are jaw-droopingly beautiful Much has been said about the supposed racism of this film. It's true that it does portray black slaves as being HAPPY to be slaves. But much more important, it's also true that the wisest person in the whole movie is Mammy. This black lady may be a slave--- later an employee--- but she is smart, funny, observant, and she's treated as an equal, if not a superior, throughout the movie. And it's made clear she deserves it. With no irony or rebuke whatever, she scornfully refers to certain low-life as poor white trash, and we know (Mammy knows too) that if they get called that, they deserve it.

He is highly attractive and usually puts himself in good, entertaining romps. that said... It is a unique role for him. the movie is a literary adaptation too, which you may have known, and I happen to like the author's work as well. Back to Fight club itself - I am not a fan of meeting in a basement to beat up other people intent on beating me up to relieve the tension of a monotonous life. I think it explores interesting questions about what is right and wrong, good and bad, acceptable and taboo. For instance, the main character \/narrator,(edward Norton), is, throughout the whole movie, schizophrenic, and actually is imagining Brad Pitt's character, Tyler Durden the entire time. He just can't accept himself fully which is clear by the way he is always fighting, physically or not, against Pitt's character's existence. I found it entertaining to watch the struggle, the success of fight club, the unexpected consequences of living this hard, man-tough, do anything and live to the max lifestyle. The idea is I guess that in a modern world, men cannot test their strength and feel fulfilled unless they've survived grueling challenges.. and participate in unchecked anarchy. Durden puts the main character through a series of grit-testing experiments to determine if he is worthy basically of being a man. I guess the real message is a little fuzzy but by the end you're rooting for Norton just because you feel for the guy, you want him to live a happy healthy life but you know he can't, he's doomed, and burdened, a true tragic hero to the end when he blows his head off (literally). This seems like a bit strong of a statement, but it was bound to happen. The vandalism the 20-odd group of violent, full grown men (project mayhem, durden's big master plan) starts attracting the wrong attention and he feels trapped... and really no one could release him from his alter-ego. So, he pulls the trigger, knowing finally that he's crazy, and thats the only way to get rid of chronic-insomnia-causing Tyler. Sadly it takes him the whole movie to realize he shouldn't be listening to the voice inside his head but its a real head trip when you realize whats going on as an audience. I dunno.... I don't tend to be entertained by many movies unless its wickedly hilarious (like a Mel brooks classic), involving lots of epic scenes (300 for example), really challenging subject matter (my sister's keeper) or some absolutely mind bending stuff ( fear and loathing in las Vegas, the labyrinth, no country for old men). I also enjoy all other Quentin Tarantino movies --- sickly satisfying, since some people in this country have a weird appetite for brutal take-no-prisoner modern kung fu epics.Like me.

The screenplay by John Paxton is particularly effective because it succeeds in bringing a level of clarity to the story's rather complicated plot at the same time as accurately capturing the style of hardboiled dialogue which is such a strong feature of Chandler's work.Dick Powell who plays the part of private detective Philip Marlowe, had previously been known for his roles in comedies and musicals and so Murder, My Sweet represented a new departure for him. In the circumstances, it's to his great credit that he managed, not only to turn in a very convincing performance, but also one which became Chandler's favourite portrayal of Marlowe. Powell is especially good at conveying the confusion and uncertainty that Marlowe frequently feels as he tries to make progress with his investigations whilst being confronted by a series of characters whose mendacity and duplicity seem to know no boundaries. His delivery of the dialogue is also superb and equally credible whether he's being witty, sarcastic or even just self-deprecatingly humorous.Marlowe certainly suffers in his work as he gets hired by five different clients during his investigations, is viciously strangled by one of them, gets his eyes scorched and also spends an inordinate amount of time unconscious as he gets knocked out twice and drugged on another occasion.In Murder, My Sweet, Marlowe is initially hired by the enormous Moose Malloy (Mike Mazurki) to find his girlfriend Velma who Moose hadn't seen for eight years because he'd been in prison. Shortly after, another client, Lindsay Marriott (Douglas Walton) hires Marlowe to accompany him to deliver the ransom for some stolen jewels. At the meeting place where the ransom is due to be paid, Marriott is killed but Marlowe doesn't see who did it.It later transpires that there's a link between the two jobs as Velma (now known as Helen) is married to an elderly gentleman named Mr Grayle (Miles Mander) and is also the owner of the stolen gems. A link between Helen Grayle (Claire Trevor) and Marriott also comes to light as both were clients of the self confessed quack psychologist Jules Amthor (Otto Kruger). Helen tells Marlowe that her necklace was stolen from her at gunpoint and he agrees to hunt down both the missing necklace and Marriott's murderer.Mr Grayle has a daughter Ann (Anne Shirley) who is devoted to her father and despises Helen who she accuses of being a gold-digger. Helen, contradicting her previous story, tells Marlowe that when she was Amthor's patient he got to know about some of her affairs and when he'd blackmailed her, she'd paid him off by giving him the necklace. Mr Grayle also becomes very concerned about his wife's probable infidelity and asks Marlowe to bring the whole business to a close as soon as possible. The action that Marlowe takes to do this eventually leads to a series of events at Grayle's beach house which result in some characters getting shot and Marlowe's eyes getting scorched before he successfully achieves his goal.Director Edward Dmytryk and cinematographer Harry J Wild make this movie a visual treat which is rich in atmosphere and highlighted by some real stand out moments such as - 1. the first scene where Marlowe is being interviewed by the police.2. the occasion when Marlowe is sitting alone in his office at night and suddenly, as a neon light flashes outside, the massive frame of Moose Malloy is projected intermittently onto the top pane of Marlowe's window.3. the dream which Marlowe has after he's been drugged.4. the scene at the beach house where Helen is lying on a sofa in very deep shadow and the only evidence of her presence is the cigarette smoke which is seen rising above her.With its intriguing story, fine performances, great direction and excellent cinematography, Murder, My Sweet really is an exceptional film for its time.

Helen tells Marlowe that her necklace was stolen from her at gunpoint and he agrees to hunt down both the missing necklace and Marriott's murderer.Mr Grayle has a daughter Ann (Anne Shirley) who is devoted to her father and despises Helen who she accuses of being a gold-digger. Helen, contradicting her previous story, tells Marlowe that when she was Amthor's patient he got to know about some of her affairs and when he'd blackmailed her, she'd paid him off by giving him the necklace. Mr Grayle also becomes very concerned about his wife's probable infidelity and asks Marlowe to bring the whole business to a close as soon as possible. The action that Marlowe takes to do this eventually leads to a series of events at Grayle's beach house which result in some characters getting shot and Marlowe's eyes getting scorched before he successfully achieves his goal.Director Edward Dmytryk and cinematographer Harry J Wild make this movie a visual treat which is rich in atmosphere and highlighted by some real stand out moments such as - 1. the first scene where Marlowe is being interviewed by the police.2. the occasion when Marlowe is sitting alone in his office at night and suddenly, as a neon light flashes outside, the massive frame of Moose Malloy is projected intermittently onto the top pane of Marlowe's window.3. the dream which Marlowe has after he's been drugged.4. the scene at the beach house where Helen is lying on a sofa in very deep shadow and the only evidence of her presence is the cigarette smoke which is seen rising above her.With its intriguing story, fine performances, great direction and excellent cinematography, Murder, My Sweet really is an exceptional film for its time.

Another point- Burton and Schumacher chose to pick really name actors looking for a paycheck to play their villains. So they really weren't really playing the characters (most of whom have been around since the 1940's), they were playing their own personas in the costumes. Sometimes, this almost worked out, like Jack Nicholsen as the Joker. In this movie, it didn't. Okay, let's start with the obvious. Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face. Not only the completely wrong guy to play the role, but then they pass on the most interesting way to use the character, which is to tell the origin story. Sorry, going for the Riddler's origin story wasn't nearly as interesting. More to the point, he played the character comedically, which just isn't what you do with Two-Face. Two-Face is actually a pretty grim character. then you had Jim Carey. Now, I like Jim Carey. He was totally wrong here. The Riddler is not a Jim Carey character. (As an aside, Carey did a very funny impersonation of Nicholsons' Joker on In Living Color in 1990 when he was relatively unknown.) He's not a character who matches wits with Batman, just some loon out to get Bruce Wayne. Kilmner was actually okay as Batman, even though his hair was the wrong color. Chris O'Donnel was whiny and not much fun as Robin. (I dislike him so much I can't stand to watch NCIS LA). Nicole Kidman, easy on the eyes, horrible for the ears. I want to bring up one more point. Pat Hingle as Commission Gordon. IN addition to the Michael Gogh, who plays Alfred, he is the only character who appeared in all four movies. Yet his character is never really that important and doesn't even look right. Now, how you could make four movies in this universe and not realize how important the character is to the mythology is beyond me.Another point- CGI. The first two movies used extensive minatures and sets, but this one used CGI to achieve the look of its Gotham City. Sadly, because this was an early effort, things look actually pretty fake.

Instead of focusing on what could have been we see that Welles wasn't a one trick pony. 'Touch of Evil' is by far the best film noir ever made. Visually it has moments that surpass even some of Kane's impressive sequences. I don't think there was a director who handled his camera better than Orson Welles.What is also extremely impressive is how Welles handles this story. The story is really the only problem this picture has going for it. Welles is given a basic dime story mystery and asked to make gold with it. I mean every character is nothing more than a cut out of countless mystery clichés. Welles not only makes this story work but he makes it compelling as well.As an actor I think Welles gets the least respect. His Quinlan is an underrated performance. To see Quinlan is to see loneliness, self hate, and uncertainty. I don't think this picture becomes the classic it has become if Welles hadn't delivered such a fine performance as Quinlan. He is a towering figure that Welles plays without his signature baritone voice. It is raspier and sadder than some of his late interviews. We feel a sense of pity for Quinlan and we are meant to for the film. Quinlan truly doesn't see what he does as wrong, it's all about the endgame. He can't be the man everyone expects him to be. I love the fact that in the end he sacrificed everything and it was all for nothing. I can't help but grieve when he is told his future is all used up by Tanya, his Mexican fortune teller. Quinlan is arched after the Shakespearean tragic heroes that Welles loved so.Charlton Heston has been given an incredible bad rap with this film. He is shot down for his portrayal of a Mexican, Vargas. I think this is extremely unfair to Chuck and I actually think he does exactly what is needed here. He looks a little silly in the make-up but he portrays the character as moral, bright, and with an unwavering center. Maybe he is a little naive but we root for him. He is the policeman while Hank is the detective. I think Chuck Heston was one of the best choices for playing this strict good man.What makes 'Touch of Evil' extraordinary however is Welles cinematography and camera work. Welles has actually beaten the Billy Wilder film noir pictures in terms of technical achievement. Remembered most is the iconic opening sequence following the bomb placed in a car trunk. However I think what is even more impressive tension wise is the ending. Vargas following Quinlan and his partner under the bridge is as suspenseful as anything Hitchcock ever did.It's said that Film Noir ended around this time, but I think Welles really ended it. His 'Touch of Evil' is the best of this genre. The murky rooms, the blatant sexual undertones, the folly of man, and the femme fatale are all at their best here.

What other movie combines psychoanalysis, Salvador Dalí, dreams and Miklos Rozsa's eerie music? As far as I know, only this one.Like in most Hitchcock movies, a good deal of disbelief is necessary; no other director made it so clear that he made cinema about fiction and not about real life. In this piece of fantasy Ingrid Bergman plays Dr. Constance Petersen, a psychiatrist who helps an amnesic man (Gregory Peck) evade the police while she tries to heal his mind to solve a murder and prove his innocence. For the amnesic man, J.B., is also accused of having killed and impersonated one Dr. Edwardes.The central scene of this movie of course is Salvador Dalí's famous dream sequence in which every aspect of it symbolises something involved in the murder of Dr. Edwardes. Dr. Petersen and her former mentor, Dr. Brulov (Michael Chekhov) must interpret and decipher it like a riddle. It's a spectacular idea, and one that I have only seen repeated again in David Lynch's Twin Peaks.Apart from these flights of surrealism, the movie is of course a great cat-and-mouse story as the couple tries to always keep one step ahead of the police, while slowly falling in love with each other (this is Hitchcock, after all, always disguising simple love stories as complex mysteries). It's also fascinating because at certain, tense moments we're left wondering whether J.B. really is a killer or not.Finally it has Miklos Rozsa's sounds of eeriness. I've discovered that the unusual sound of the main theme is achieved by an instrument called Theremin, invented just a few years before the movie. It's so striking that it has become forever connected with horror, fear and mystery in cinema, as exemplified by its use in Bernard Hermann's score for the otherworldly sci-fi movie The Day The Earth Stood Still. Rozsa used it also in The Lost Weekend.Watching this movie at night alone in my living room, I felt scared several times. Even with the lights on this movie still delivers tension and suspense after sixty-four years. I can only imagine what it must be to watch it in a dark theatre.
