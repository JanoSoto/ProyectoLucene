[{"date":"4 June 2007","score":"9 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":" I Still Know What You Did Last Summer follows Julie (Jennifer Love Hewitt), who is still suffering from the memories of her friends' murders by a vengeful fisherman who she and her friends had accidentally hit with their car and disposed of his body, thinking him to be dead. Her college friend, Karla (Brandy Norwood) wins tickets to the Bahamas via a radio station contest, so she, Karla, Karla's boyfriend, Tyrell (Mekhi Phifer), and a friend Will, head off on vacation. Meanwhile, Ray (Freddie Prinze Jr.), Julie's ex-boyfriend, has an encounter with the fisherman again, and heads to the island to save Julie. But soon enough, bodies begin to pile up on the mostly-deserted island (which is currently in it's storm season) all around Julie and her friends, and it seems the fisherman has returned.I considered the original I Know What You Did Last Summer to be a fairly good slasher movie that evolved during the late '90s. It had a nice revenge-laced premise about teenagers who had to pay the consequences for their mistakes at the hands of a psychotic fisherman, and it was very well done in comparison with most slasher movies of that era. This sequel popped up only a year later, and while it may be very unoriginal, it's still entertaining. In terms of story, the idea was well put together, and the tropical, stormy Bahaman island was the perfect setting for this film to take place, and a nice change from the gloomy coastal town the previous film was set in. I knew a sequel was coming, after the first film succeeded well with audiences, it was nearly inevitable. The violence factor is much more gratuitous in this sequel, it's gore galore for this movie, which wasn't surprising. It seems that way for a lot of horror movie sequels.Also, being no surprise, this film is almost beyond cliché-ridden. Typical horror set-ups, scares, and character stupidity is present throughout the course of the movie. It's unrealistic a lot of the time, and there are plot holes everywhere, so in that sense, it's a bit of a mess. But on the other hand, despite all of the unrealistic events, I have to admit that this is an extremely entertaining movie. Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Jr. reprise their role, and Brandy Norwood and Mekhi Phifer play her lively friends. Jennifer Esposito (whose career hadn't quite taken off yet) also plays a worker on the island who the gang teams up with when the fisherman begins to off the island's population. The acting was nothing more than average at best, but it was tolerable (nothing too bad, I have seen much worse). But besides, what can you expect from this type of flick? The film ends with one of those gotcha! jump scares quite similar to the ending of the original, and puts a close on this series (unless you count the 2006 direct-to-video sequel that follow this) on a rather silly but fitting note. The entire movie is a little far-fetched, but so what?Overall, I'd advise anyone who is tired of your run-of-the-mill slasher movies to avoid I Still Know What You Did Last Summer like the plague, because I can guarantee that they will be sorely disappointed. But for those who enjoy some cheap horror entertainment every once and awhile, this clichéd little slasher sequel is an entertaining way to spend a couple of hours, but don't expect to take any of it seriously. 6\/10.

Both setting and plot were fabulous and it definitely showed The World. Forrest Gump starts telling how stupid he is and then he becomes a marvelous football player, a ping pong player, and shrimp fisherman. He has a different intelligence and that makes him special and so successful in life. The most inspiring thing he does is how he fights for Jenny. When he always follows her and never gives up on her. At the beginning of the film, I thought he was really stupid but I realized that all he says is symbolic. He acts stupid but is actually smarter than most of the other people, that is why you should never judge someone by his\/her appearance. He also has the typical Alabama accent, which makes the movie seem even more realistic. Each character was used surrealistically and unrealistically to show the theme everyman.The actors in this movie are perfectly well cast. Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) is such a good actor and plays his role brilliant. He should've deserved an Academic award. Sally Field, who plays Forrest's mother, is actually only 4 years older than Tom Hanks, plays her role as a mother really well and symbolizes good motherhood. She can act as if she is 20 years older than him. Jenny (Robin Wright) plays her role as a good friend of Forrest and Hippie also very well. All the main characters do their job really well in this movie. The most supporting character was Jenny (Robin Wright). She was the main reason why Forrest Gump did everything. At the end where she dies, he even mentions it that he's done everything she wanted and that he loved her. She really supported him to achieve something in his life.I really liked the setting in this movie. Where Forrest Gump starts off as a normal boy to a man in a small fictional town in Alabama, and then travels around and sees the whole world. He is a simple Alabama kid and becomes all of a sudden really famous. It is like his life was chosen by destiny. That he would start off really small and then become very big and famous. He didn't choose to become a football player or a shrimp fisherman; he met Bubba to even find out what shrimps were. Only one thing was something he chose and always wanted to have, to get married with Jenny. His love and everything he would do for her to make her happy. The author did this on purpose. He wanted to show himself as everyman. That everyman can achieve something in their lives, not as much as Forrest Gump like he was there most of the events and became a ping pong player and all that. Obviously he couldn't be there on those events, but this is for the theme, to show everyman.When Forrest Gump started to run around the whole world, he inspired many people. Only by running he just made them all run with him. He is a great inspiration even though people think he is dumb. He does things that seem to be stupid, but actually are very clever. He is a very hard-working man and achieves everything which everyman wants. That shows basically the theme of this movie work hard and you will achieve your goals. No wonder that this movie had won several Academy Awards. It is a great movie and I would suggest all the people who don't believe in themselves to watch this movie. It helped me a lot to work for my dreams, my hopes, and everything what I always tried to be.If I had to rate this movie, I would give 9 out of 10 points because it has an exciting plot and well-chosen characters. Alabama is a great place for the setting of this movie and everywhere Forrest Gump went was also well chosen to show the theme Life is like a box of chocolates! It means that you never know what you will get and everyman doesn't know what they get except trying to achieve their goals to find out. This movie has more than only one theme, but talking about all themes would take ages. It has got the theme of war and theme of motherhood and much more. The movie was definitely better than the book since it was more realistic and had better characterization. It is basically a message to us to see what is happening in the world or what happened. It really impressed me and I would watch it again because it is so interesting. It is almost perfect but as we all know, nothing or no one is perfect!

I ended up paying a bit more than that to import what is one of the worst-quality DVDs I have yet seen, of this film or any film in existence. Even when you ignore the fact that the DVD is clearly sourced from an interlaced master and just plain nasty to watch in motion, the film has no redeeming qualities (save Anna's presence) to make watching a top quality Blu-Ray transfer worthwhile. Not that this is any fault of the other actors. Liev Schreiber, Diane Lane, Tovah Feldshuh, and Viggo Mortensen all score high on the relative to Anna Paquin acting ability chart. Far more so than Holly Hunter or Sam Neill did in spite of an equally lousy script, anyway. Director Tony Goldwyn's resume is nothing to crow about, but Pamela Gray's resume includes Wes Craven's most dramatic excursions outside of the horror or slasher genre, so one could be forgiven for thinking this is a case of bad direction.As I have indicated already, the sole reason I watched this film is Anna Paquin. In her acting debut, she literally acted veterans of the industry with a minimum of twelve years' experience above hers under the table. While she is not as far ahead of her castmates here, her performance as a girl that starts the piece as a brat and grows into a woman whose world is crashing down around her proves her Oscar was no fluke. For some time I have been stating to friends that she would be the best choice to portray the heroine of my second complete novel, and a dialogue seventy-three minutes into this film is yet another demonstration of why. This woman could literally act the paint off walls. Anna aside, only Liev Schreiber comes close to eliciting any sympathy from an audience. Sure, his character spends the vast majority of the film neglecting a wife with an existential crisis, but he plays the angered reaction of a man who feels cheated brilliantly. I should know, even if it is not from the same circumstances here.Viggo Mortensen also deserves credit for his portrayal of a travelling salesman, although perhaps not to the same extent. In a manner of speaking, he is the villain of the piece, but he successfully gives the character a third dimension. Yes, his actions even after the whole thing explodes are underhanded, but not many men would act any differently in his situation. Nobody wants to be the other man in this kind of messed-up situation, so Viggo deserves a lot of credit for giving it a try here. Unfortunately, these are all participants in a story about a woman who feels trapped in a stagnant marriage where Tovah Feldshuh tells us that the Mills And Boon archetype of women being the only ones who feel life is passing by simply does not exist. Either writer Pamela Gray or director Tony Goldwyn thought they could just put this line into the film without thinking of how the audience might receive it. Anna even gets to speak the mind of the audience when she asks Diane who she is to be lecturing anyone about responsibility.That said, the film does have a couple of things besides Anna going for it. Mason Daring's original music, while not standing out in any way, gives the film a certain feeling of being keyed into the time depicted that helps where the other elements do not. Roger Ebert is right when he points out that while Liev is a great actor, putting him alongside Viggo in the story of a woman forced to choose between her marriage and her fantasy is a big mistake. He is also very correct in that when the film lingers over scenes of Lane and Mortensen skinny-dipping or mounting one another under a waterfall, it loses focus from being a story of a transgression and becomes soft porn. The film seems terminally confused about the position of its story. No matter how many times I rewatch Liev's scenes, I cannot help but feel he has been shortchanged in the direction or editing. One does not have to make their leads particularly handsome or beautiful, but taking steps to make them the most interesting or developed characters in the piece would have gone a long way.Ebert also hits the nail right on the head when he says that every time he saw Anna on the screen, he thought her character was where the real story lay. Stories about the wife feeling neglected and running into the arms of a man who seems interesting or even dangerous are a dime a dozen, to such an extent now that even setting the story in parallel with an event as Earth-shattering as the moon landing will not help. In spite of feeling revulsion at the manner in which her character's story is presented, Anna might as well be walking around with a neon sign above her head asking the audience if they would not prefer to see the whole thing through her eyes. While I am all too aware that it is difficult to control exactly which character your audience will find the most interesting from your cast, it is very much as if they did not bother to try with Lane and Schreiber. Fans of these two would be well advised to look elsewhere. Hopefully by now my ramblings about the respective performances will give some idea of where the whole thing went wrong.I gave A Walk On The Moon a three out of ten. Anna Paquin earns it a bonus point with one of her best performances (and that is saying something).

For some time I have been stating to friends that she would be the best choice to portray the heroine of my second complete novel, and a dialogue seventy-three minutes into this film is yet another demonstration of why. This woman could literally act the paint off walls. Anna aside, only Liev Schreiber comes close to eliciting any sympathy from an audience. Sure, his character spends the vast majority of the film neglecting a wife with an existential crisis, but he plays the angered reaction of a man who feels cheated brilliantly. I should know, even if it is not from the same circumstances here.Viggo Mortensen also deserves credit for his portrayal of a travelling salesman, although perhaps not to the same extent. In a manner of speaking, he is the villain of the piece, but he successfully gives the character a third dimension. Yes, his actions even after the whole thing explodes are underhanded, but not many men would act any differently in his situation. Nobody wants to be the other man in this kind of messed-up situation, so Viggo deserves a lot of credit for giving it a try here. Unfortunately, these are all participants in a story about a woman who feels trapped in a stagnant marriage where Tovah Feldshuh tells us that the Mills And Boon archetype of women being the only ones who feel life is passing by simply does not exist. Either writer Pamela Gray or director Tony Goldwyn thought they could just put this line into the film without thinking of how the audience might receive it. Anna even gets to speak the mind of the audience when she asks Diane who she is to be lecturing anyone about responsibility.That said, the film does have a couple of things besides Anna going for it. Mason Daring's original music, while not standing out in any way, gives the film a certain feeling of being keyed into the time depicted that helps where the other elements do not. Roger Ebert is right when he points out that while Liev is a great actor, putting him alongside Viggo in the story of a woman forced to choose between her marriage and her fantasy is a big mistake. He is also very correct in that when the film lingers over scenes of Lane and Mortensen skinny-dipping or mounting one another under a waterfall, it loses focus from being a story of a transgression and becomes soft porn. The film seems terminally confused about the position of its story. No matter how many times I rewatch Liev's scenes, I cannot help but feel he has been shortchanged in the direction or editing. One does not have to make their leads particularly handsome or beautiful, but taking steps to make them the most interesting or developed characters in the piece would have gone a long way.Ebert also hits the nail right on the head when he says that every time he saw Anna on the screen, he thought her character was where the real story lay. Stories about the wife feeling neglected and running into the arms of a man who seems interesting or even dangerous are a dime a dozen, to such an extent now that even setting the story in parallel with an event as Earth-shattering as the moon landing will not help. In spite of feeling revulsion at the manner in which her character's story is presented, Anna might as well be walking around with a neon sign above her head asking the audience if they would not prefer to see the whole thing through her eyes. While I am all too aware that it is difficult to control exactly which character your audience will find the most interesting from your cast, it is very much as if they did not bother to try with Lane and Schreiber. Fans of these two would be well advised to look elsewhere. Hopefully by now my ramblings about the respective performances will give some idea of where the whole thing went wrong.I gave A Walk On The Moon a three out of ten. Anna Paquin earns it a bonus point with one of her best performances (and that is saying something).

Valentine is definitely an old school slasher with similarities to My Bloody Valentine which also has the same theme. Valentine came out during the re-interest of slasher movies that was started by Scream and lots of others followed like I Know Whar You Did Last Summer, Urban Legends and this one.This movie certainly did not disappoint from the great opening with a young Jeremy Melton asking out a group of girls to dance but they all make fun of him and say no until one girl says yes and she turns against him and has him beaten up and humiliated, it then skips ten years later with one of the girls Shelly (Katherine Heigl) who teased him and she gets murdered, the build up to that was awesome especially the bit where she gets the sick valentine card Roses Are Red, Violets Are Blue, they need Dental records to identify you. I also thought the killers mask, cupid was really cool and original. The ending to this movie is also really confusing when the killer is unmasked, but the death scenes were very creative and just brutal I won't give too much away just see it for yourself.Denise Richards (Paige) was absolutely stunning playing the slut and does it brilliantly, David Boreanaz (Adam) played the only likable male in this movie and is very good looking too, Marley Shelton (Kate) was really sweet and I loved her puppy dog eyes, I thought she did a good job as the main character, Jessica Cauffiel (Lily) was underused and found her funny and sexy, Jessica Capshaw (Dorothy) played her part well and you really feel for her as well, Katherine Heigl (Shelly) victim No1 looks cute and seemed interesting in her very short time and the other men Camobell and that artist guy really annoyed and bugged me.All in all If you like old school horror then you'll like this, it has a good start brilliant killings, stunning looking girls and well it's just a fun ride.

Most of this almost supernatural mystique that has impregnated the city since those days was a direct result of the economic bonanza of the Roaring Twenties and the creation of the star system, imposed by the major film studios in the early years Hollywood's Golden Age. The myths and legends of classic Hollywood would soon be exported to the world, and became an enormous influence for an Austrian young writer named Samuel Billy Wilder. Wilder would later move to America after the rise of the Nazi regime, and started a promising career at Hollywood, the very place of his dreams of youth. The opulence and decadence of the city inspired Wilder to write and direct a legendary movie in 1950 Sunset Boulevard.Sunset Boulevard is the story of two persons, writer Joe Gillis (William Holden) and former silent-film star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), whose lives will coincide on Sunset Blvd. and will never be the same again. As a scriptwriter, Gillis has not been lucky for a while, and finally finds himself hunted by two repossession agents who expect him to pay for his car. In his attempt to flee, Gillis hides his car in an apparently abandoned mansion on Sunset Boulevard. However, the mansion is not deserted, and inside he mets the owner, the legendary film star Norma Desmond, who has faded into obscurity after the arrival of sound movies. After she discovers Gillis is a writer, she offers to hire him so he can help her with a script she has been writing for her comeback to cinema. Gillis accepts, thinking it's an easy way to earn fast money, but soon he'll discover that nothing comes off that easily, specially on Sunset Blvd.While the movie is definitely Wilder's brainchild, the script was written with the help of his usual collaborator, Charles Brackett; and former film critic D.M. Marshman Jr., who was hired by Wilder and Brackett to help them develop the plot. The story follows the classic film noir pattern, but soon it is obvious that this movie goes beyond any genre conventions as it adds touches of horror, drama and black comedy in the most unmerciful critique to the decadence of Hollywood's Golden Age. The way the writers develop the characters is simply perfect in all its cynic realism, as while the characters are not without a touch of grotesque, they still look and feel so real that just enhance the horror and tragedy of this twisted tale about the dark side of Hollywood. Filled with fascinating characters, carefully placed details and a wonderful tale of madness, the script for Sunset Blvd. is definitely one of the finest ever written.As if writing a monumental screenplay wasn't enough, Wilder also excels as a director in this masterpiece, bringing his script to life in a haunting and beautiful way. Just like he did 6 years before with Double Indemnity, once again Wilder reinvents the film noir genre thanks to the amazing cinematography by John F. Seitz, who captures the darkness of Norma Desmond's life with his heavily atmospheric film noir photography. His care for details and references to old Hollywood extend beyond his screenplay and populate the film in more than one way (the inspired use of cameos by real former silent-film stars for example), adding a great amount of authenticity and realism to the movie. Finally, the performances he managed to get from his main cast are simply some of the best done in an American movie.Many has already been said about the outstanding performance done by Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond, but I can't help but commenting on the extraordinary level of perfection she achieved on her role. In her eerily autobiographical character (Desmond's past resembled Swanson's career in some ways), Swanson transforms herself in the vivid incarnation of the twisted mirror image of Hollywood's life, creating a larger than life character that gave her a much deserved praise. In his breakthrough role, William Holden makes an excellent subtle and witty counterpart to Swanson's over-the-top character, and despite facing extraordinary actors in this wild ride through Hollywood, he never disappoints and proves to be up to the challenge. Finally, legendary director Erich Von Stroheim appears as Norma's stoic butler, and adds a haunting aura of dignity to the movie with the powerful presence of his acting.Despite being a powerful criticism to the studio system and a brutal deconstruction of the Hollywood myths, Sunset Blvd. is also a fond love letter to the movies that resulted from it, and specially to the artists behind them (The cameos by director Cecil B. DeMille, Buster Keaton, H. B. Warner and Anna Q. Nilsson are a testament of this); as while tragic and pathetic, there is a certain sweetness and humanity in the characters that makes this set of old Hollywood ghouls to be so charming despite their madness. While not without flaws (Nancy Olson's performance feels uninspired when compared to the rest of the cast), Sunset Blvd. is one of those movies that truly deserves its status as classic, as thanks to Wilder's direction and the cast's performances, it reaches the closest a film can be to perfection.Time magazine described the film as the story of Hollywood at its worst told by Hollywood at its best, and that's probably the best way to describe the haunting story of Norma Desmond in Sunset Blvd..

Jordan Brewster played the head cheerleader and object of Casey's affections Delilah really well and was also nice to look at, definitely the sexiest babe in this movie the only problem is we don't see enough of her, Clea Duvall played the outsider Stokley brilliantly, she really looked the part at first she's bitchy and mean but her character develops more and more as the film progress, Josh Hartnett fresh faced at the time and this was one of the 2 horror movies he did that year, truly showing that this is his breakout performance and went onto bigger things, here he's playing Zeke the drug dealer\/under achiever\/main trouble maker, really well and his character really develops throughout the film. Shawn Hatosy plays the jock character Stan really looks the part and acts the part and shows that there's more to him that just being a jock and lastly out of the six students Laura Harris who plays the new girl Marybeth Louise Hutchinson who's really sweet in her role and while starting her first day at school, it gets overtake by body snatching aliens. We also get a lot of cameo type roles from some of the bigger names in the movie like Robert Patrick famous for playing the bad guy in Terimator 2, has fun playing the psycho gym teacher, Famke Janssen playing femme fatle Miss Burke and even R&B singer Usher Raymond and Salma Hayek in small and pointless roles.All in all I recommend this movie to anyone, if you like movies like Invasion Of The Body Snatchers and The Thing, well the Faculty is just like a modern day telling of the those movies only much better, it's fast paced and will have you on the edge of your seat the entire time.

Wes Craven) Story Back in 1984, a new horror franchise was introduced by Director Wes Craven. This was the third franchise to hit cinema screens during this period. The Friday the 13th series and the Halloween series both introduced silent killers, which slowly moved around killing each victim off one by one. The killer here is very different and offers quite a cocky mood with many jokes and one liners said as he delivers unique ways of death to the individuals. The concept of the killer is very different, as he can only kill you in your sleep. Unlike Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers, Freddy Krueger quickly finishes you off as you try to stay awake. Like most horror movies, there are a group of 'teens' to work together to try and survive their nightmares.Actors There are only 4 primary hero characters and 1 villain, although other minor characters do appear at different times. Heather Langenkamp brings to life a wonderful heroine in the form of Nancy Thompson. She brings so much life to the character and you really do start to feel for her, but there are times where she doesn't feel sad enough after so many deaths. A very young looking Johnny Depp also appears. For his feature film appearance, Depp delivers a performance so convincing, that he looks like he was born with the acting bug. It's hard to believe he would go on to be the idol he is today.Music The music is one of the few things which are not very memorable in the film, but this is a good thing. Charles Bernstein does make a theme for the 'Nightmare on Elm Street' series which still sends shivers down your spine to this day. I feel that in horror films, music can disappoint the audience with its slow sweeping soundtracks as a death is about to happen. I prefer it when it's deadly silent.Special Effects The special effects in this film are very basic and simple, yet are still very, very effective. The make up transformation which Robert Englund goes through is remarkable and a lot of effort has been put into it. The deaths aren't very brutal, although some can be considered gory. They have been done in a way which are not the usual deaths, whilst still doesn't go over the top. Some effects are unrealistic, such as super long Freddy arms, but still fit into the dream like work.Conclusion Overall, 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' is an wonderful horror fan, which anyone who fancy some frightful fun should watch. It has everything from horror to comedy, and even a bit of romance.When I get nervous, I eat,  &#150; Glen Lantz (Johnny Depp) ","genre":null},{"date":"4 June 2007","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984, Dir.

Unlike most Hollywood horror\/slasher movies, it did what most of the latter cannot, which is provide a combination of good lucks and good acting, therefor ensuring we care about the characters.Scream most definitely took a page from this movie as inspiration for its mystery theme. Though the budget was low and this movie was made in 1980 I feel that it still has enough of a story to keep us entertained and also enough of a punch to make us jump a bit. But what really makes Prom Night a success is its actors. Jamie Leigh was wonderful as always, but one character I felt that stole the show was the character of Wendy. As vile and wicked as they made her, the actress portraying her gave her depth. I felt as a viewer that she was more than just the typical bitch character. With killer lines, a beautiful face, and a chase scene that has been the foundation of future horror movie chase scenes, this girl makes the movie worth watching.If you happen to see this movie on or notice it in a video store I would suggest giving it a look.

By this quote Forrest Gump makes us think that it is like a box of chocolates. When you pick one out with out looking at the wrapper you won't know what will happen, this makes us think about real life. How do you know what is going to happen in our lives. This is one of the most popular movies in 1994. It won 6 Oscars.The setting of this film is based in a small fictional town in Alabama. Then later it goes through the whole world. The director, Robert Zemeckis wants you to see that this movie goes all around the world. The director shows us that this movie is surrealistic. The author is trying to tell the audience that this film has a very long time setting. In the movie goes from 1950-1980.Forrest Gump is a surreal character. The director makes him surreal when he starts running with his braces and they suddenly burst off him. He is supposed to be an idiot but he helps many people around him by accident. He teaches people lessons. And helps them and himself. Sally Fields plays Mrs. Gump; she does one of the best Alabama accents. She is an example of a good mother. Jenny is realistic character. In the movie her father abuses her, in the story she needs a friend, she becomes friends with Forrest. She doesn't want to be with Forrest in an other way because he is too much child-like. Then later she finds something in him and she marries him. Lt. Dan is good and super-realistic character played by Gary Sinise. He helps Forrest during the Vietnamese war and when they open the shrimp company. Bubba played by Myelti Williamson. He is a non-realistic character. He is one of Forrest's best friends. Myelti Williamson plays Bubba really good. In the movie he shows the meaning of true friendship.In the movie there is a really big use of plot but it is surreal. Forrest Gump was born with a low IQ. But he still makes it into college by playing football. Then he becomes one of the biggest hero's in America because of the Vietnam War. He starts with ping-pong and reaches the champion ship. In memory of his friend Bubba he opens a shrimp company. He falls in true love and wants to be a father. There are many themes in this movie. The biggest one I think is love. His whole life is with love. There is also a use of friendship. The use of friendship is very big through out the whole movie too.My rating for this movie is very high. I would give it a 9 out of 10.

It well maintained the theme from the original version of book, Life is like a box of chocolates and Stupid is as stupid does This movie contains a lot of great actors and actresses who could act their own characters very well and showed the theme or plot. The reason why this film became so popular is because this story isn't just for the certain period or certain people, but for everyone.The movie begins in the small fictional town in Alabama but soon; the setting of this movie goes on to the whole world. The setting also proves about the universal theme, Everyman All the important events happen between late 1950s to late1980s. This movie doesn't only affects about late 1950s to late1980s but the present time also. Such as white trash and people who have physical problems didn't live only between 1950s to 1980s but they still exist.There are several characters that strongly affect the theme or the plot of this movie. First of all, the surrealistic character, Forrest Gump who was acted by Tom Hanks well represented the theme and also well showed of physical problem of Forrest. His IQ was under 70 and he had a problem with his legs when he was young. When he became an adult, he was still prejudged by people based on his intelligence. However, later he becomes really famous and rich. This event doesn't really mean to show that Forrest Gump became a successful person, but the movie is trying to break a strong stereotype of people, by using Forrest Gump. Also, it is telling not to judge people's ability or characteristics by intelligence or physical abilities. Like his quote stupid is as stupid does. Mrs. Gump, Sally Fields, the actress was actor playing the mother of Forrest shows the theme of strong determination of all mothers in the world. Even though only ten year older than the grown Forrest Gump, her acting was so realistic that the audience didn't realize her age. Jenny, who was acted by Robin Wright, showed the reality of dark side of Americans' life. In the movie Jenny was the white trash but she isn't the only who is showing the theme of American life but partly, but through L.T he is somehow showing it too. He's character was so realistic. A deep friendship is expressed through his characterization.Generally, there are six most interesting events that are happening in this movie. In my opinion, starting the movie by grown Forrest Gump talking about his childhood from the present time on the bench is a good idea. His first interesting event starts when he entered school. He had a hard time. On the school bus everyone seemed to avoid him or be as far away from him, only because of his physical appearance. But later, Jenny who didn't look about her appearance came to him and be friend. Other than this, there are three events that Forrest Gump becoming all famous and meeting the U.S president three times. With this event, the plot goes really high in audience interest and I'm sure that viewers loved these events. Lastly, there is one important event left, about Jenny and Forrest that went audience very pleased but not a real happy ending.I was very impressed with this movie, especially with the acting skills and the themes of this story. This is a film that everyone would like and feel empathy with all these characters. The plot also appeals to average and ordinary people. I recommend this movie to all people no matter how old they are.

Also, it is telling not to judge people's ability or characteristics by intelligence or physical abilities. Like his quote stupid is as stupid does. Mrs. Gump, Sally Fields, the actress was actor playing the mother of Forrest shows the theme of strong determination of all mothers in the world. Even though only ten year older than the grown Forrest Gump, her acting was so realistic that the audience didn't realize her age. Jenny, who was acted by Robin Wright, showed the reality of dark side of Americans' life. In the movie Jenny was the white trash but she isn't the only who is showing the theme of American life but partly, but through L.T he is somehow showing it too. He's character was so realistic. A deep friendship is expressed through his characterization.Generally, there are six most interesting events that are happening in this movie. In my opinion, starting the movie by grown Forrest Gump talking about his childhood from the present time on the bench is a good idea. His first interesting event starts when he entered school. He had a hard time. On the school bus everyone seemed to avoid him or be as far away from him, only because of his physical appearance. But later, Jenny who didn't look about her appearance came to him and be friend. Other than this, there are three events that Forrest Gump becoming all famous and meeting the U.S president three times. With this event, the plot goes really high in audience interest and I'm sure that viewers loved these events. Lastly, there is one important event left, about Jenny and Forrest that went audience very pleased but not a real happy ending.I was very impressed with this movie, especially with the acting skills and the themes of this story. This is a film that everyone would like and feel empathy with all these characters. The plot also appeals to average and ordinary people. I recommend this movie to all people no matter how old they are.

It well maintained the theme from the original version of book, Life is like a box of chocolates and Stupid is as stupid does This movie contains a lot of great actors and actresses who could act their own characters very well and showed the theme or plot. The reason why this film became so popular is because this story isn't just for the certain period or certain people, but for everyone.The movie begins in the small fictional town in Alabama but soon; the setting of this movie goes on to the whole world. The setting also proves about the universal theme, Everyman All the important events happen between late 1950s to late1980s. This movie doesn't only affects about late 1950s to late1980s but the present time also. Such as white trash and people who have physical problems didn't live only between 1950s to 1980s but they still exist.There are several characters that strongly affect the theme or the plot of this movie. First of all, the surrealistic character, Forrest Gump who was acted by Tom Hanks well represented the theme and also well showed of physical problem of Forrest. His IQ was under 70 and he had a problem with his legs when he was young. When he became an adult, he was still prejudged by people based on his intelligence. However, later he becomes really famous and rich.

I thought this movie tells us about everyone's life and my opinion of this movie was that I liked it very much and it is very enjoyable to watch. You won't get bored and the plot of the movie always develops. In the movie Forrest Gump, the setting is rather weird because it is set in a small fictional town in Alabama. That is where Forrest starts. Later in the movie the story takes place in the whole world. This means that he represents every human being. The time setting is between the 1950s and 1980s. This time was important to the U.S. history because it was after the World War II and it was a new start for the people of the United Sates of America. Another example of everybody or universal is the character Tom Hanks. Tom Hanks plays Forrest Gump. I think he is a very good actor and the role suits him. When Forrest Gump was a little child he had polio and a low level of IQ. His IQ was around 70. He lived with his mom in a big farm outside the town. They had no money so Forrest's mother used their big house as a hotel. On the first day of school, he met Jenny. Forrest thought she was a nice-looking young girl and fell in love. Another important point of him is that he had polio and everyone rejected him except for Jenny. He had polio as he was born and it is when the legs aren't strong enough to hold you and he had to wear braces. Sally Fields plays Mrs. Gump, she is Forrest's mother and cares a great deal about Forrest. After Forrest grows old she got a sickness and died with an old age after Forrest becomes popular. She was a very good mother to Forrest. Robin Wright as Jenny lives alone with her father in a very small house also outside of the town and her father abuses her very often so she tries to stay away from the house as long as possible. In the movie, Gary Sinise plays Lt. Dane. He was a super realistic character, meaning that he was almost too realistic for this movie. He plays his role really well and my opinion to him is that he is the best actor from this movie. Bubba, he is a fascinating unrealistic character. Myketti Williamson plays Bubba in the movie and was the best friend of Forrest in the movie. He is the meaning of true friendship. The one thing that is unrealistic is that Forrest Gump cannot meet all the presidents of America and all the celebrities that he saw in the movie and run around the world without any reason. It is rather a symbolic meaning. The plot of this movie is very interesting. As time passes the plot development raised always higher and higher. One of the themes of this movie is that the main character, Forrest Gump, represents everybody's life. One of the quotes that he said was life is like a box of chocolates. It simply means that you will never know what will happen in life because you never know what piece of chocolate you will take out. Sometimes you take a good one out or sometimes you take one out you don't like that much. The other interesting quote was stupid is as stupid does. This quote's significance means that you should not judge someone on their reputation but on their actions or it is stupid to call people stupid. This movie was a really good movie. I would rate it really high because the plot of this movie is really interesting and the director must have really thought about it. It would be a really hard movie to make. I think Forrest Gump is a movie that everyone has to watch because you will see how everyone's life is like. The plot is really interesting because it has a big increase all the time.

Each of the four story elements of characterization, plot development setting, and themes are very effectively presented. It was very popular when it first came out, and people even now still discuss it, considering it as a modern classic. In the first eighteen days, it took $100 million in only American cinemas, more than any other film made by Paramount Pictures before. The movie was first written as a novel by an American author Winston Groom. The movie was made in 1994, directed by an American director Robert Zmeckis.The story has an odd setting. It is set in a small fictional town in Alabama, but also the whole world. The filmmaker used this to represent his theme of 'everyman'. It has a long time setting. The story covers several generations from 1950s to 1990s. By covering of the world's time of losing innocence, as at the same time presenting Forrest as a symbol of innocence, he shows how the world has changed during the time.The main character Forrest is an extraordinary person. He, played by Tom Hanks, is born with polio. He needed braces for his legs when he was young. He also has a low IQ of 70. He is unusual. He is different from other people in a lot of special ways. Forrest Gump represents all Humanity, as a kind of modern-day 'Everyman'. He is judged by his intelligence and appearance by other people. This leads to another theme of the story. Judging a person by one thing about them cannot explain the person. The filmmaker uses this astonishing character to show the viewers the surrealism. The events go under realism, but all the things that happen to him cannot happen to one person. This intentionally unrealistic characterization is used to give us the message that we are all human.Other characters are also very interesting. His mom Mrs. Gump, played amazingly by Sally Field, tries really hard for him to find the best of him. She is willing to do anything for Forrest, and she always stands up for him. She symbolizes good motherhood. Forrest's beautiful girlfriend named Jenny, also his first and the only friend in the school, later becomes his wife. She was the victim of physical and sexual abuse by her father when she was young. Her childhood was like living hell for her. In the film played fantastically by Robin Wright, Jenny plays one of the major roles in the movie, contributing to the plot development and the theme of acceptance and tolerance.The mood of the film changes as Jenny comes to find Forrest, and then just leaves him alone again. The film slowly develops its high points. The first day of school is one. It is important because it shows that even little kids judge him by his looks. Later he goes to Vietnam and gets involved in the war. When he runs the entire breadth of America, the plot reaches one of its highest points with some humor in it.There isn't only one theme in the film Forrest Gump. Life is like a box of chocolate, he says. You don't know what you're given, until you've opened your chocolate. Additionally, whatever you're given in life, you should always try to achieve your personal best. It also makes the viewers wonder about the idea of destiny and choices in life. The film has a universal theme of acceptance and tolerance. He says, Stupid is as stupid does. He might not fully understand what he's really saying, but the filmmaker intends the viewers to understand. It really means that it is not stupid to be unintelligent, but it's stupid to judge people on actions, not reputation, and to name-call them. The film tells us what it's really like to be a human. It expresses another universal experience of how we're more alike than not alike.Overall, I would say this movie is terrific. It doesn't only tell us about its themes and meaning of life but make us think about them as well. Both the actors' incredible performances, and the stimulating script writing make this movie so magnificent. The movie has won 6 Academy Awards including best picture. I strongly recommend you watch this movie and or read the original novel. It is important to understand what it's like to be a human, what it's like to be different, what it means to accept and understand each other and I'm sure you'll really like the movie too.

He, played by Tom Hanks, is born with polio. He needed braces for his legs when he was young. He also has a low IQ of 70. He is unusual. He is different from other people in a lot of special ways. Forrest Gump represents all Humanity, as a kind of modern-day 'Everyman'. He is judged by his intelligence and appearance by other people. This leads to another theme of the story. Judging a person by one thing about them cannot explain the person. The filmmaker uses this astonishing character to show the viewers the surrealism. The events go under realism, but all the things that happen to him cannot happen to one person. This intentionally unrealistic characterization is used to give us the message that we are all human.Other characters are also very interesting. His mom Mrs. Gump, played amazingly by Sally Field, tries really hard for him to find the best of him. She is willing to do anything for Forrest, and she always stands up for him. She symbolizes good motherhood. Forrest's beautiful girlfriend named Jenny, also his first and the only friend in the school, later becomes his wife. She was the victim of physical and sexual abuse by her father when she was young. Her childhood was like living hell for her. In the film played fantastically by Robin Wright, Jenny plays one of the major roles in the movie, contributing to the plot development and the theme of acceptance and tolerance.The mood of the film changes as Jenny comes to find Forrest, and then just leaves him alone again. The film slowly develops its high points. The first day of school is one. It is important because it shows that even little kids judge him by his looks. Later he goes to Vietnam and gets involved in the war. When he runs the entire breadth of America, the plot reaches one of its highest points with some humor in it.There isn't only one theme in the film Forrest Gump. Life is like a box of chocolate, he says. You don't know what you're given, until you've opened your chocolate. Additionally, whatever you're given in life, you should always try to achieve your personal best. It also makes the viewers wonder about the idea of destiny and choices in life. The film has a universal theme of acceptance and tolerance. He says, Stupid is as stupid does. He might not fully understand what he's really saying, but the filmmaker intends the viewers to understand. It really means that it is not stupid to be unintelligent, but it's stupid to judge people on actions, not reputation, and to name-call them. The film tells us what it's really like to be a human. It expresses another universal experience of how we're more alike than not alike.Overall, I would say this movie is terrific. It doesn't only tell us about its themes and meaning of life but make us think about them as well. Both the actors' incredible performances, and the stimulating script writing make this movie so magnificent. The movie has won 6 Academy Awards including best picture. I strongly recommend you watch this movie and or read the original novel. It is important to understand what it's like to be a human, what it's like to be different, what it means to accept and understand each other and I'm sure you'll really like the movie too.

Each of the four story elements of characterization, plot development setting, and themes are very effectively presented. It was very popular when it first came out, and people even now still discuss it, considering it as a modern classic. In the first eighteen days, it took $100 million in only American cinemas, more than any other film made by Paramount Pictures before. The movie was first written as a novel by an American author Winston Groom. The movie was made in 1994, directed by an American director Robert Zmeckis.The story has an odd setting. It is set in a small fictional town in Alabama, but also the whole world. The filmmaker used this to represent his theme of 'everyman'. It has a long time setting. The story covers several generations from 1950s to 1990s.

It was released in 1994 with a great actor, Tom Hanks playing the main character Forrest Gump. It won six Academy Awards, which proves that many people liked the film.This story is set in a very small fictional town in Alabama, which presents the whole world. It is a microcosm of the world. The filmmaker wanted viewers to empathize with Forrest. He wanted us to know how stupid it is to judge people by intelligence and appearances. This film has a very long time setting, from the late 1950s to the late 80s, to show the growth of America and its loss of innocence, in modern times. Winston Groom presented the characters in a very interesting way by using some of the characters surrealistically but some very realistically. Forrest Gump, who is played by Tom Hanks in the film, is presented as an everyman. He is used surrealistically and is a character that is used symbolically. This has a universal appeal. His story applies to every single one of us. Forrest Gump was born in a small town in Alabama as an idiot, and had an IQ of 70, which is low compared to normal kids. He is judged upon intelligence and appearances, but some of the things he says actually have deep meanings. Tom Hanks was perfectly cast. His gestures, face expressions, and the way he talked made the character seem alive and very realistic. Sally Fields, who played Mrs. Gump, did a great job presenting the determination of the mother's character. She is a very realistic character. Mrs. Gump is willing to do anything for her son. She is very protective and she didn't want Forrest to go to a special school, so she even slept with the Principal of a school to make him allow Forrest to go to that school. Jenny, who is played by a wonderful actress Robin Wright, is also a realistic character. She was the only child who was nice to him in school, and that's why Forrest falls in love with her. When she was young, her father physically but also sexually abused her. Jenny's dad symbolizes bad fatherhood, whereas Mrs. Gump symbolizes good motherhood. Jenny has a lot of disappointments in her life and also tries to commit suicide, which shows how parenting is important and can ruin one's life. Lt. Dan is a super realistic character that Forrest meets during the Vietnam War. During the war he loses both legs and nearly dies, but Forrest saves his life. Forrest helped Lt. Dan not give up his life, but start a new fresh life catching fresh shrimps together. They start up a shrimp company and make a lot of money. This develops the theme of true friendship.There are many other themes in this story, such as determination, tolerance, and parenting. But I think there are two very clear and important themes. Life is a like a box of chocolates is one famous Forrest Gump quotations. This quote hints us one of the theme of this story. It sounds unintelligent, because he is holding a box of chocolates and says it while he's taking one out and eating it, but if you think about it, it has a very deep meaning. You don't know what's going to come up in your life, just like you don't know what kind of chocolate might come out. Life's unexpected. But is it really just destiny, or can life be chosen? The quote, Stupid is as stupid does tells us another important theme. It's telling us not to judge by appearances or intelligence. Winston Groom is giving us a very important lesson judge on actions, not reputation.Overall, the casting and acting of the actors, and each of the four story elements were well presented. The setting and the idea of the universal theme were very well developed. Also, the idea of Winston Groom to present the characters both realistically and surrealistically was brilliant.

This was a haunting type of story, especially when my folks, who went with me, informed me that these marathon type of dance contests really did happen. The characters might have been fictional, but not story of these awful contests.Jane Fonda plays the central character, Gloria Beatty, an angry-at-the-world and profane woman who certainly has a cynical attitude. It almost echoed her real-life persona at the time, but I won't go there. I was more fascinated with Gig Young's performance in this film as the ruthless dance promoter - emcee Rocky. To me - and Academy Award voters - his performance stands out among all the others, even though everyone does an outstanding job. That includes director Sydney Pollack, who had only made a few movies until this one.The deep cast in this film did not include big-name stars but they were known celebrities actors like Michael Sarrazin, Susannah York, Red Buttons, Bonnie Bedalia, Bruce Dern and Al Lewis.This is a sad tale of desperate people in desperate times trying to make a few extra bucks during the Great Depression years. Dancing in pairs, they literally risked their health by trying to stay on their feet by dancing longer than every other couple. One became mentally exhausted just watching these poor people on screen trying to survive these marathons.Like a lot of movies which deal with unpleasant topics, this is a haunting film that will leave you thinking about it for a long time afterward. I can't say I enjoyed watching it the second time around, on VHS - Fonda's nastiness too much to take - but I certainly wouldn't discourage anyone from watching this movie. It's a story about an unique event in American history guaranteed to be one you won't forget.

This was a haunting type of story, especially when my folks, who went with me, informed me that these marathon type of dance contests really did happen. The characters might have been fictional, but not story of these awful contests.Jane Fonda plays the central character, Gloria Beatty, an angry-at-the-world and profane woman who certainly has a cynical attitude. It almost echoed her real-life persona at the time, but I won't go there. I was more fascinated with Gig Young's performance in this film as the ruthless dance promoter - emcee Rocky. To me - and Academy Award voters - his performance stands out among all the others, even though everyone does an outstanding job. That includes director Sydney Pollack, who had only made a few movies until this one.The deep cast in this film did not include big-name stars but they were known celebrities actors like Michael Sarrazin, Susannah York, Red Buttons, Bonnie Bedalia, Bruce Dern and Al Lewis.This is a sad tale of desperate people in desperate times trying to make a few extra bucks during the Great Depression years. Dancing in pairs, they literally risked their health by trying to stay on their feet by dancing longer than every other couple. One became mentally exhausted just watching these poor people on screen trying to survive these marathons.Like a lot of movies which deal with unpleasant topics, this is a haunting film that will leave you thinking about it for a long time afterward.
