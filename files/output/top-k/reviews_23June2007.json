Tim Robbins was truly spectacular in this as was Morgan Freeman, who proves he is one of the true talents out in Hollywood. They were both deserving of Academy Award nomination, though Freeman received one. I can't still comprehend how it didn't win ANY Oscars, though it certainly deserved Best Picture and 4 or 5 other Oscars. But this is another example of movies being shot down at the Oscars by fell good movies, such as Forest Gump. Nonetheless, this movie is a story about hope and how important not giving up is. Andy Dufresne is one of the most interesting characters of the 1990's and this role and the role of Ellis Red Redding were written perfectly for the acting talents of Robbins and the Freeman. I am grateful to for Frank Darabont for directing a movie that is a stunning as Shawshank. I also applaud the other actors, the cinematography, editing, and sound that went into the making of this movie. Though I remain bitter over what the Oscar did to this movie, I will continue to put the Shawshank Redemption up in my favorite list, and praise it as a true masterpiece. 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"23 June 2007","score":"","review":" The Shawshank Redemption is one of those perfect movies and an example of a movie that does not need CGI and a lot money to make it Oscar worthy, though it is.

The Hockey action is exciting, and intense, and George J. Finn is fantastic as dirty goon Racki you will hate him for the stuff he pulls, plus I loved the opening with Youngblood(Lowe), strutting His stuff with Hockey skills and I loved all the neat tricks he did. Sure it may look a little cheap at times, but it didn't bother me a bit, and some people complained the story was dull and boring, but I found it to be very engaging and interesting, plus it has one funny moment where Ed Lauter (Coach Chadwick) catches Lowe with a Nympho Book. You will love the end, cause it's a great underdog story, and The Hockey scenes felt very realistic, plus watch out for Keanu Reeves who plays the Goalie!. Overall This is an awesome Hockey film and I say it's an absolute must see!. **** out of 5The Acting is great!. Rob Lowe does a terrific job here as Dean Youngblood, he had great Hockey skills, and while he may have looked a little stiff at times he really came through in most of the scenes, and you will especially feel for him near the end with what happened to Swayze's character, I feel this may be his best role!. Patrick Swayze is very good here in his role as Sutton he's cocky but lovable and cracked me up a couple of times I just wished he had more screen time. Cynthia Gibb is not bad as Chadwick's daughter she shared good chemistry with Lowe and was a Cutie to boot!. Ed Lauter is good as the strict yet likable coach he cracked me up as well. Jim Youngs does a good job as Lowe's brother. Eric Nesterenko does alright as the Father considering he was a famous Hockey player!. George J. Finn is fantastic as Racki, you will hate his guts as he actually made me think he was a despicable goon. Keanu Reeves is OK as the the goalie he was a bit goofy for my tastes I dig the guy but it's not one of his better roles loll.

It's played as a mockumentary, (a fake documentary) with director Rob Reiner playing the role of the interviewer of the band. If it wasn't a movie in which you can retake scenes, I am sure we would have seen him laugh a number of the serious questions he asked this stupid band. I would think it would hard not to laugh in a number of places, because he plays a very serious interviewer. I'm sure he did many times.There are funny moments in here. The only part I really didn't like was near the end when the bickering of the band got out of control. Their constant arguing gets tough to take after awhile. That's another problem here; there are no appealing characters. This British band is not comprised of nice guys, and I also found their accents tough to understand. If this is out on DVD with English subtitles, it might be worth a second look.The music was fair, nothing to rave about. Overall, I enjoyed the movie but didn't find it anywhere as great as most critics described it. It's okay, but not that funny.One of the writers, Christopher Guest, has gone on to make several mockumentaries. He has done quite well with that genre, better than Reiner.

Well, it's certainly that. But not every film that's made in black in white, has disturbing images, and goes through demented sequences that make no freaking sense is brilliant - although a lot of people obviously disagree with me.Maybe my first clue should've been the opening credits, which rolled a sequence supposedly of the number pi. As someone well acquainted with mathematics, the very first thing I noticed was that the number they put on the screen was an accurate representation out to the first 8 digits. After that it was just a stream of completely random numbers.Well, I said to myself, They had to know very, very few people would ever notice. Still, it was a bit irritating. It can't be that hard to come up with a few more than 8 digits of the value of pi, especially when you're spending the money to make an entire movie.Sadly, things only went downhill from there. And incidentally, the movie turned out not to have not ANYTHING to do with pi at all! As near as I can tell, the pi bits were only thrown in for their marketing value. The story is all to do with some other number.The best thing that Pi has going for it (really, the ONLY thing) is the music. The rest is just black-and-white-filmed ravings, repetitive shots of the main character shaking and downing pills, repetitive script (how many times do we get told the same thing in the exact same words?), repetitive freak-out episodes, and long shots of nothing in particular. Blurry scenery.The movie was so **** boring that after watching it for as long as I could possibly stand (the first hour), hoping, hoping, HOPING that it would get better, I finally started skipping ahead, pausing for the parts that looked like they might actually contain some content. There were relatively few of these.As far as I can recall, this is the only movie I've ever seen that at 84 minutes was WAY too long. It just seemed like the **** thing would never end. Perfect example of movie hell Nothing ever happens, and the movie has no ending. Instead it just goes on forever.If you enjoy being beaten for hours on end with decaying sturgeons, or if you think a bogus-science movie filmed in blurry black and white in which the main character is demented must AUTOMATICALLY be cool, then there's a chance you might like this movie.

The story is all to do with some other number.The best thing that Pi has going for it (really, the ONLY thing) is the music. The rest is just black-and-white-filmed ravings, repetitive shots of the main character shaking and downing pills, repetitive script (how many times do we get told the same thing in the exact same words?), repetitive freak-out episodes, and long shots of nothing in particular. Blurry scenery.The movie was so **** boring that after watching it for as long as I could possibly stand (the first hour), hoping, hoping, HOPING that it would get better, I finally started skipping ahead, pausing for the parts that looked like they might actually contain some content. There were relatively few of these.As far as I can recall, this is the only movie I've ever seen that at 84 minutes was WAY too long. It just seemed like the **** thing would never end. Perfect example of movie hell Nothing ever happens, and the movie has no ending. Instead it just goes on forever.If you enjoy being beaten for hours on end with decaying sturgeons, or if you think a bogus-science movie filmed in blurry black and white in which the main character is demented must AUTOMATICALLY be cool, then there's a chance you might like this movie. Otherwise, I'd go for something with more entertainment value. Like SuperBabies Baby Geniuses 2...

As a teenager, she is brought back to Crystal Lake to confront her fears and to understand her anxiety and powers. But when she is pushed too far, she brings back a surprise from the bottom of the lake -- Jason Voorhees (tied to a rock from part six).This film fails in so many ways. It is not very funny, it is not very scary... the plot is decent, but really just more of the same from the last six films. I do not know what director John Carl Buechler (Troll) was thinking. I guess the idea of Jason versus Carrie is somewhat interesting, but this film does not really make it seem like it is worth my time. (In Buechler's defense, though, the original kill scenes were much more graphic, as evidenced by the Slashed Scenes featurette. Had this been in the final product, my opinion would have greatly been altered.)In a horror film, you need to be funny or scary or both. This one does not offer us either. The lack of humor can slide if there is a decent body count, but guess what -- there just is not. Pay close attention and you will notice in almost every single death, the camera moves away or cuts off before anyone actually gets stabbed or chopped. No gore, no blood. It is left to our imagination, which sometimes works, but not here. Especially after some gorier films earlier in the series (and if you have seen Jason Goes to Hell, which tops them all). Again, I know this should be blamed on the MPAA, but everything possible should be done to get those cut scenes mastered and put back in.One good thing was the sleeping bag scene (even if it was also cut short). It is not funny or gory, but it pays off when you see Jason X (if you can remember this awful film by the time you get to part ten). The other good thing is that this is the movie that introduces Kane Hodder as Jason Voorhees, who I consider the best Jason (and I think many would agree). Buechler might lack other skills, but he knows how to cast (he personally brought Kane with him from a previous film they made together).And also, I guess I should give Buechler a second break if you watch the special features, you will see in an interview that he designed a cool head for Tina's dad to have as a corpse. The other people involved would not let him use it. This was a big mistake. And his take on what Jason looks like without the mask is pretty cool, though my colleague Seth claims that the maskless Jason seems less human and therefore less scary. I am undecided.I guess there is one scary thing about this film Susan Blu's atrocious hair, and maybe some of the wardrobe choices... thank you, 1980s. If you must watch this, watch it with the commentary turned on. While it is a bit slapdash and should probably be re-recorded, it gives valuable insight into why the location was chosen and other behind-the-scenes tidbits. If you do not mind a bland, mostly humorless, almost blood-free Jason movie with poor continuity (how did he get to the other side of the lake and why is the lake's name changed back to Crystal Lake from Lake Forest Green?), this is for you. If you are like me, you have watched so far in the series that you just have to finish it... do not worry, only one more bad one to go. Get some popcorn and a Miller Chill or some Early Times whiskey and just relax. And if you have time, petition them to get those cut scenes put back in!

This is the question that Crimson Tide poses, and answers, throughout the course of the movie. During a fictional conflict in Russia, a rebellion ensues and a commander takes control of a large part of the Russian military. The Russian government, still intact, is in control of the launch codes for Russia's nuclear arsenal - however, if the rebellion grows in size and the government is compromised, the rebellion will take control of the codes and launch the missiles in response to any action taken against them. At this point the United States military is dispatched in response to this threat.Gene Hackman is the captain of the U.S.S. Alabama, a nuclear-equipped submarine dispatched to the waters off the coast of Russia. His Executive Officer (X.O.) has taken ill, and so he brings aboard Denzel Washington as the new, relatively unexperienced replacement. Denzel Washington is highly recommended and has served with several of the crew members of the Alabama, including Viggo Mortensen, the Weapons Officer.Spolers coming up, beware! During the Alabama's patrol, the submarine receives a message from the Pentagon informing the submarine that the rebellion has seized control of the government and the launch codes have been compromised. The submarine is instructed to arm its nuclear missiles in response to this threat, so that should the need arise to make a preemptive strike against Russia the submarine can do so.In the midst of this process, the sonar room reports a Russian submarine only feet away from them in the water, and the Alabama is forced to go into quiet mode and dive deeper in order to avoid being detected. The submarine dives so deep their communications go offline, and they are unable to receive any further orders from the Pentagon. They cannot rise to a broadcast depth for fear of being detected by the Russian submarine, but they cannot afford to wait, because the Russians may be in the process of launching their missiles already. Since time is a factor, Denzel Washington recommends to Gene Hackman that they float their communications buoy up to a lower depth in order to receive further orders. Another urgent message from the Pentagon arrives, but is cut off when the buoy is actually snagged by the Russian submarine prowling the waters above them. This cripples the communications systems aboard the Alabama while at the same time giving away their position to the enemy. The Russian submarine launches torpedoes, which the Alabama dodges, and the Russian submarine slips away.The partial message that the Alabama received starts with Permission to launch nuclear weapons-- and is cut off. The commanders of the Alabama are left in a horrible position - do they assume nothing has changed, and the nuclear weapons they are still prepping for launch are now to be fired in order to save the United States? Or do they assume that the message was sent in order to prevent a nuclear launch because something has changed on the surface, and call off the launch for fear of starting a nuclear war that could have been avoided? You'll have to watch the movie to find out. While not giving away the rest of the plot and the resolution to this conflict, I can tell you that this movie is an excellent watch for almost anyone, for three reasons 1) The acting is superb. Gene Hackman, Denzel Washington, Viggo Mortensen, James Gandolfini, Matt Craven, and many others form an extremely talented cast who pump emotion, intelligence, compassion, and above all internal conflict into their characters, which drives the story and makes it that much more compelling.2) The subject matter is epic. The crew of this submarine is very, very close to launching the only other nuclear missiles since World War II. The keys are in the locks, the missiles are fueled and ready, and the only thing standing in the way is the conflict on board the submarine and inside the character's heads.3) The characters are all extremely well developed. There is no character here that is simply stereotype X. There is no war-mongering general, like Jack Nicholson's character in A Few Good Men, who is immediately marked as the bad guy. There is no clear cut bad guy, or clear cut good guy. Instead, there are characters with different, well reasoned view points who disagree over something extremely important in the heat of a submarine battle. Every character is well rounded, believable, intelligent, and their motives can be easily understood even if their actions aren't agreed with. This conflict could very easily be real, with real people, and that's what makes this story so compelling.This is definitely a must-see for almost anyone. It's a great action movie, but it's a lot more than just an action movie, which is why I recommend it so highly.

His performances in the Halloween movies, whether the movie be good or bad, is always very strong and is one of the only reasons i liked the other sequels, Halloween 2 is no different, Pleasence is just a wonderful actor.As the movie goes on, you can really tell that this script had to be extremely hard to write. There are even some lines that are repeated from the first movie but are updated, this is mainly from the Dr. Loomis character. This movies budget is higher then the first movie but is still fairly low, just passing 2.5 million dollars to make, and the movie looks great, even with a low budget.I did not like the music in this movie, changing the tone of the Halloween Theme made the theme less scary. Instead of using the classic piano tune, they changed it to almost like an organ, which doesn't work.Overall, no matter what flaws, this movie is wonderful.

In my opinion, Curtis doesn't really give as good of a performance as she did in the first Halloween. Donald Pleasence also returns as Dr. Loomis. His performances in the Halloween movies, whether the movie be good or bad, is always very strong and is one of the only reasons i liked the other sequels, Halloween 2 is no different, Pleasence is just a wonderful actor.As the movie goes on, you can really tell that this script had to be extremely hard to write. There are even some lines that are repeated from the first movie but are updated, this is mainly from the Dr. Loomis character. This movies budget is higher then the first movie but is still fairly low, just passing 2.5 million dollars to make, and the movie looks great, even with a low budget.I did not like the music in this movie, changing the tone of the Halloween Theme made the theme less scary. Instead of using the classic piano tune, they changed it to almost like an organ, which doesn't work.Overall, no matter what flaws, this movie is wonderful. It might not be as scary as the first one but it is a classic.Rated R for Extreme Graphic Violence, Nudity, Sexual Situations and Profanity.

No matter how you want to see it, this musical-like movie based on the well-known series has insulted several people, mocked them, and said horrible things about them, but also made most of those people rolling on the floor of laughter.I love South Park. I think it is brilliantly written and very rewarding for those who pay close attention because there are so many comical layers that you want to watch the series and this movies multiple times so you can peel all those humorist layers off.The movie tells the story of 4 boys, Kyle, Eric, Stan and Kenny, who get to see a movie with tons of profanity. Being so impressed with the movie, Kenny Makes a dubious bet and sets himself on fire. Because of this, their mothers find a protest group, Mothers Against Canada, and eventually the U.S. government blames Canada for spoiling American youth. Canada bombs the Baldwins, and the U.S. declares war on Canada, and promises to execute Terrence and Philip. but this must not happen, because if that happens, because if these two figures get executed, Satan, currently having a gay relationship with Saddam Hussein, will come up to earth, making havoc and mischief. Therefore Stan, Kyle and Eric make a group of resistance children to stop the execution and their mothers once and for all.Such a wildly absurd premise is not only completely ridiculous, but also outrageously funny and a very good basis for political satire and hilarious one-liners like The MPAA says Horrific exploited violence is okay, as long as there aren't any naughty words! that, is what this war is about!. It got me rolling out of my seat. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are extremely sharp and always let you know that they know what they're talking about. Great, great movie.
