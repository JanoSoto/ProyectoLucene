[{"date":"6 December 2014","score":"","review":" The Iron Giant is an underrated animation film and is just plain excellent, more so than it ever has a right to be. On paper, it's practically an animated version of E.T, but the film works despite the non-original story. It is full of substance and style with an underlying political commentary that will appeal to the adults. The kids will love the gorgeous animation (very good for a 1999 film) and the story about an unlikely friendship. I haven't seen this in many, many years until recently, but it was always one of my childhood standouts.Brad Bird's earliest theatrical film is about a kid named Hogarth befriends a giant robot from another world, during the height of the Cold War and the launch of Sputnik. Hogarth tries to protect the giant-sized robot not only from his mother, but also from a bunch of bureaucrats believing the giant is actually a spy for the Soviet Union.The voice acting is not that bad. The robot does not speak English at first, but when he does, it was voiced by Vin Diesel who made the robot seem even more lifelike. We also have some solid voice acting from the likes of Jennifer Aniston, Harry Connick Jr., and Eli Marienthal.Overall, The Iron Giant is one of those rare gems that appeal to both adults and children. The story is executed well enough against the backdrop of political and historical issues and the film is also a visual spectacle with the animation way beyond its time.

Peter Jackson's seminal Lord of the Rings trilogy was the first great cinematic masterpiece of the twentieth century, and although never equalled it has at least influenced some very watchable fantasies, notably the Chronicles of Narnia and Harry Potter series. And Before Jackson? Legend reminded me of how bad fantasy films could be (and generally were) during the seventies, eighties and nineties. About the best of a bad bunch was Ron Howard's Willow, and even that only achieved the modest distinction of being a mediocre film rather than a truly awful one. Having a famous director at the helm didn't always help matters. For a long time I always thought of Richard Fleischer simply as 'the idiot who made that rubbish Red Sonja &#x96; an unfair assessment, as Fleischer had earlier been responsible for films as good as The Vikings, 20,000 Leagues under the Sea and 10 Rillington Place. Red Sonja, together with the equally dreadful Conan films, probably damaged Arnold Schwarzenegger's career by establishing him in the public mind as a musclebound hulk with minimal acting skills. Legend was also the work of an otherwise distinguished director. Indeed, Ridley Scott's previous film had been Blade Runner, in my view one of the greatest science fiction films ever made. Legend probably represented a desire to follow it up with something as different from it as possible. Scott's original aim was to produce a film based upon a traditional fairy-tale or legend, but could not find one which suited his purposes and so had the idea of commissioning an original story. The film is set in a sort of wooded fairyland which would forever be a place of beauty and enchantment were it not for the principal villain, the Lord of Darkness (or just Darkness for short). You can tell he is a villain because he looks just like traditional depictions of the Devil, except that his horns are more like a cow's than a goat's. As the film opens, Darkness has just decided to kill off the world's last two remaining unicorns, as (contrary to what astronomers may inform you) it is unicorns which cause the sun to rise every morning. A world bereft of unicorns will therefore be a world of eternal darkness- from Darkness's viewpoint, a Good Thing, but from everyone else's a Bad Thing. Darkness also has lustful designs on the beautiful Princess Lili (or Lily, depending on which version of the film you see). The task of foiling his evil schemes falls to Lili's sweetheart, a young man named Jack, who has the assistance of various characters lifted straight from the pages of some sub-Tolkienesque fantasy novel. Among these are a lisping, effeminate faun named Honeythorn Gump (brother of the more famous Forrest), a fairy named Oona and two dwarfs named Brown Tom and Screwball. (Or are they elves? Or perhaps leprechauns, given that they speak with a strong stage-Irish brogue?) There are also goblins, but as in Tolkien they are the bad guys, so they bat for Darkness's team. You can work out the rest of the plot from here. The lead role of Jack was taken by an up-and-coming young actor named Tom Cruise, at this time in the middle of his 1980s pretty-boy period, but he never does anything to show why he was, within a few years, to establish himself as a major Hollywood superstar, although, to be fair, he was possibly unlucky with a dull, hackneyed script and some stilted, ponderous dialogue. Cruise was fortunate that he followed Legend up with Top Gun, made by Scott's brother Tony. This was probably the best of his pretty-boy movies and a huge box-office success. As for his leading lady, the teenage Mia Sara, she shows all too clearly just why, despite her striking beauty, she was never to become a big name herself. The best acting comes from Tim Curry as the spectacularly-horned Darkness, but even he cannot really manage to rescue the film. Indeed, he may have inadvertently made it worse. In a film where the villain seems more real than the heroes, the audience might start rooting for him, which was probably not anybody's intention. Scott originally wanted to film in Yosemite National Park, but financial considerations precluded location shooting, and a complete forest set was built at Pinewood Studios. A lot of effort was obviously put into this, and yet the result is still oddly unconvincing. (Even fantasy films need a certain grounding in reality, and Yosemite might have done for Legend what the New Zealand landscapes did for the Lord of the Rings trilogy). The same can be said of the whole fantasy universe in which the story is set; it never seems to hang together as a coherent whole in the way in which, say, Tolkien's Middle Earth does. I think that the difference lies in the fact that Tolkien spent many years working out all the details of his imaginary world, whereas all the details of the imaginary world of Legend were probably worked out on the back of a fag-packet during someone's coffee-break. Legend is not the worst fantasy film of all time; compared to Red Sonja or Prince Valiant, which continued the tradition of the execrable sword-and-sorcery epic into the nineties, or to The Scorpion King which continued it even into the After Jackson era, it can look quite presentable at times. Compared to something like the Narnia or Harry Potter series, however, to say nothing of Lord of the Rings, it seems sadly wanting, a low point in Ridley Scott's career. 4\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"6 December 2014","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Heroic fantasy films can be divided into two categories, Before Jackson and After Jackson.

With epic battle sequences, rousing speeches, remarkable performances by some of Hollywood's best actors, and its inspiring tale of man's quest to liberate his homeland from tyranny, Braveheart is as great a film as has ever been made.Following the (mostly) true story of Scottish outlaw, hero, and martyr William Wallace, the film takes us from the childhood events that would shape him, through his war against the English, and to his betrayal and execution at the hands of Edward II. In any hands this would be an exciting tale, filled with violence, treachery, and intrigue. And in Gibson's hands, with a script based on the writings of the 15th century poet Blind Harry, this is truly a tale to inspire. It is inspiring because it is the story of a man who wanted only to live and work in peace, but who was willing to take up arms to avenge the woman he loved.It is inspiring because no matter how high the odds were stacked against him, and no matter what he was offered in return for halting his crusade, he would not give up his struggle to free his beloved Scotland. And it is inspiring because unlike other men, who would have sought to use their military success towards their own rank and status, Wallace fought under the banner of another, Robert the Bruce, even when Robert did not deserve it. For Wallace it was not about power, or wealth, or even his own honor, though this mattered to him greatly. It was about seeing Scotland free and independent under the man who rightfully held claim to the throne.William Wallace, as depicted here, is one of the greatest heroes in any film, and only Mel Gibson could have done the role justice. Despite the scandals and alcoholism that have plagued him in recent years, there can be little doubt that Gibson was, and is, a great actor. And when this film was made, he was at the very height of his career and acting ability. Earnest and charismatic he brings both the gravity and experience of a veteran actor and the energy and enthusiasm of a younger man. Few actors will ever give a performance as great as the one he gave here, and it was unquestionably the best of his career.The other cast members also performed excellently. Patrick McGoohan is the very epitome of ruthlessness as Edward the Longshanks. Sophie Marceau likewise performs very well as the noble princess Isabella, whose romance with Wallace, although wildly historically inaccurate does much to give the film an extra emotional pull. Angus Mcfayden is particularly compelling as Robert the Bruce. He is a good man who genuinely wants to do the right thing, but who lacks self confidence and is plagued by evil council. It is with great anticipation that we await the moment he will break free from his fears and doubts and take up the cause.From a technical and cinematic standpoint, Braveheart is exceptionally well made. No expense has been spared on the sets and costumes, and the film utilizes some of the most beautiful settings in Scotland and Ireland. And the battle scenes are among the greatest ever to be put on film. The scale of the battles is something to behold, with hundreds of fully armed and costumed combatants on both sides. Nor have the filmmakers shied away from the sheer brutality of medieval warfare. Watching the axes and claymores strike their mark, the hard part is believing that people weren't harmed. This violence alone, without the later execution scene, is enough to earn the film a hard R rating, but it is absolutely what's needed.It may be graphic, it may be suspect in its historical accuracy, and I admit it has cast aside much of the complexity of the real William Wallace for the sake of a more compelling narrative. And of course it's a vanity production on the part of Gibson. But Braveheart is absolutely the kind of rousing epic that audiences crave. It is well acted, well crafted, and contains a compelling story and an uplifting message at its heart. Wallace's cry of Freedom! will resound with you long after the film has ended.

Sheer unremitting madness is what it is about, and madness is the form that it takes for much of its runtime. Coppola has taken the classic Heart of Darkness, crossed it with Herzog's Aguirre, The Wrath of God, and set it against the madness of the Vietnam War to produce a film that is darker, more disturbing, and perhaps more profound as any I have ever seen. Watching this, you will see the face of true horror, and you will be changed.For any who do not know the story, Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) must travel far upriver into Cambodia to confront and eliminate Colonel Kurtz (Marlin Brando) a once ideal soldier who has gone rogue and is presumed to be completely insane. And on his journey he will see more darkness than he could have imagined, and discover that the truth is far worse than any had believed.Since this is a movie review, I suppose I should comment on the acting, production values, etc. They are excellent. The sets and jungle locations are gorgeous. The battle scenes, especially the airborne assault, are among the best Hollywood has ever produced, with massive scale, incredible camera work, and pyrotechnics that would be the envy of Michal Bey. And the cinematography has lent much of the film an otherworldly feel, like the most horrifying acid trip possible.The acting is likewise excellent. Sheen's performance as the haggard, mentally exhausted, and increasingly disturbed Captain Willard has changed my entire opinion of him as an actor. His haunting narration sets the tone for the entire film, and his eyes speak volumes in every scene. They tell the story of a man who thought he had seen it all, only to discover that he was horribly wrong. And Brando, despite having relatively little time on screen, is truly unforgettable. He is the very essence of a man who is profoundly unwell, and utterly detached from sanity.And that is what Apocalypse Now is all about, the retreat from any semblance of sanity. On the journey upriver, we are confronted with madness of every form and color. There is the blood-lust and near suicidal bravado of Kilgore (Robert Duval) who lives and breathes war, and simply does not give a damn about his personal safety. It takes someone more than a bit off to go surfing as enemy bullets are ripping overhead or to remark that napalm smells like victory. There's the utter detachment of Dennis Hopper's photojournalist, who seems to float along in a state of perpetual high, mistaking the madness of others for true wisdom. And the sheer idiocy of Lance, who drops acid in the midst NVA invested territory, and who yells 'Look guys, purple haze as he envelopes his own boat in thick clouds of colored smoke, never mind that they're on an uncharted stretch of river deep in Cambodia.And there's the more generalized kind of madness that pervaded the whole war. The madness of forcibly moving entire populations in the hope that they would be grateful to us for protecting them. The madness of rebuilding a bridge every day and defending it against attack every night, just so the generals can say the road is open, casualties be damned! Or the madness of sending high strung, inexperienced, dope smoking kids on a sensitive dangerous mission. Other than Willard and possibly the skipper, no-one on that boat had any business being in a war zone.But all of this pales in comparison to the sheer insanity of Colonel Kurtz. He is a man who has decided that not only do the ends justify the means, but that only the most horrifying means will achieve those ends. He has absorbed every ounce of the madness he's encountered, he has fully embraced that madness, and he has been transformed into a fount of madness, spewing forth pure horror and infecting everything it touches. The truly scary thing is that even half dead; rarely stepping out of his quarters, Kurtz still wields more absolute power than any man ever should. His madness is mistaken for divinity by followers who will commit any act for him. He's like an aged Charles Manson, with an entire tribe of true believers rather than a handful of dropouts.Even scarier is that on one level he's right. By embracing the horrors of war, he and his people have done more damage to the enemy than any comparable force. If we'd had ten divisions of troops as ruthless as his, we could have destroyed the Cong and the NVA, but only at the cost of our souls. And yet in his rare moments of lucidity, Kurt knows and understands that what he has done is completely beyond the pale of decency or civilized humanity. Deep down, he hates what he is doing and what he has become. He no longer fears death but craves it, because it is the only escape from the nightmare he has created. His only wish is others may understand what happened to him and why he became what he did.And I do. I cannot condone, excuse, or forgive any of what he has done, but I understand.

The strength of this movie is the writing and these characters are amazingly written and are put in a great concept. There is only jealousy as the villain and this leads to great comedy. In my opinion, some of the best forms of comedy are made from competition and seeing these two characters trying to do the right thing and just being consumed by jealousy is great to watch. It was also clever and interesting. The film doesn't really have a villain. OK, maybe Sid, who loves to blow up toys, and you either knew this kid or was this kid when growing up. However, even Sid is just trying to have fun. So, he can't really be called a villain. That is why the writers are so good. They make everyone identifiable. The idea of toys coming to life is nothing new, we have seen it before but they put this wonderful little spin on it which just works. The CGI holds up pretty well. Sometimes.

Not only one of the greatest gangster films, but one of the best films ever made in general. To review a film like this is very hard, because in my opinion, this is one of those perfect films. There is so much to talk about with this great film, that there is no room for one review on this site. My review will contain some behind the scenes notes and facts about the film as well as an added bonus that make it that much more interesting. The following is my review of Scarface.The story on this remake of the 1932 film of the same name was written by Oliver Stone. Oliver Stone is well know for films like Natural Born Killers, Platoon, and JFK. The original film followed a gangster during prohibition, while this story follows a gangster during the cocaine rush of the 1980s in Florida. While key aspects of the film aren't much different, the film makers on this version of Scarface did a fantastic job making this their own film. Very few remakes can say they are one of the best films ever made.To gain some knowledge on the subject at hand, writer Oliver Stone went to Colombia and actually spent time with these cocaine dealers. Over the course of spending time with these dealers, he became addicted to cocaine. To finish writing the film he had to fly to Paris to get away from all the drugs. The end result was clearly a masterpiece.The story itself is a rise and fall type story. In this case the film follows a Cuban refugee, who wants to become rich. He will do whatever it takes to realize that goal. He builds himself up as a man that can be trusted to earn his way up the ladder of success. With great money and great power also causes great problems. The story about the life of drug users and pushers that Stone crafted was simply fabulous. The characters are rich in nature, and this is easily some of the best character development you will see in a film. There are a great deal of scenes where we see back and forth talking, and this is where the amazing acting comes into play.The acting lead by the star, Al Pacino is simply one of the best all around for a film. Not only does this film star the legend Al Pacino, but it also stars greats like Steven Bauer, Robert Loggia, Michelle Pfeiffer, F. Murray Abraham, and many more as well. The actors gel amazingly in this film. To have scenes where actors need to sit there and talk back and forth, and to have it be great is not easy. That is where the fabulous cast comes into the picture. Director Brian De Palma really shows how great of a director he is in this aspect of the film. To not only have a fantastic acting team like this, but to turn that into amazing acting is not always a given, but De Palma succeeded in this film, as did the actors.Director Brian De Palma delivers one of the better gangster films of all time in this outing. De Palma is well know for other hit films like Carrie, The Untouchables, Carlito's Way, and Mission Impossible. His vision he makes for the screen is in fact legendary. There are some scenes with brutal violence, but De Palma never really takes it over the top into what we would now call a gore fest. He makes you feel the pain that is about to come. A great film maker can do that, and De Palma is a legend.The film was composed by Giorgio Moroder who is also well know for the scores on films like American Gigolo and Flashdance. Moroder delivers a heavy 1980s score that really captures the nature of the film and the story. Some might now consider this type of score cheesy, but for the time this film takes place, it work amazing. The score adds so much depth to the film as well. Moroder has a strong outing on this classic film, and should not be overlooked.In closing, they say remakes are bad. However, Scarface from 1983 is one example where a remake can be fantastic and legendary. I rarely dish out a perfect 10 out of 10 for films, but Scarface is a rare film that deserves that much respect.

With gems like future events such as these will affect you in the future, followed immediately by the suggestion that this has already happened (time duality?), the fact that the script was written in 2 weeks somehow doesn't seem surprising. And it's beautiful. So, so beautiful. Best watched when you need cheering up. I guarantee Plan 9 From Outer Space will bring joy to your soul.

It is a perfect film, and would easily win a fight against the Godfather. If you look up perfect in the dictionary, you first see Meryl Streep's Oscar Nomination Record, then The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. But what could possibly be so good about this western?The film begins with the most jarring cinematography I have ever seen to start a film. After the intro theme, this man, Elam, pops his head into the screen. This not only sets up the rest of the film's cinematography, with the camera either super close or super far away, but also gives us a face to remember, as in an hour and a half or so we will meet this character again. In this scene we meet The Ugly. Later The Bad. Then The Good. This contrasts from the title, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, as we show the characters in the opposite order from which we may expect. The Ugly runs off after attacking Elam and two other outlaws. The we turn to an arid section of the desert where we meet Angel Eyes. We know that he's up to no good as everyone nearby quickly hides. Except for this guy, who keeps eating his soup. This probably because he knows its his last meal. We learn that Angel Eyes is looking for a man by the name of Bill Carson. He is searching for Carson because there is a lot of money behind his name, and because he was hired to help Baker, the man who hired Angel Eyes to take out this Soup Man. However, by the end of the meal, we have not only set up an objective, but also some character development. Soup Man knows that he is going to die, but pays Angel Eyes to kill the man who paid to kill him. Angel Eyes accepts the job, and the cash, but still kills Soup Man as, Once I'm paid, I always see the job through.He goes through with his new job kills Baker, the man who hired him originally. This shows that although Angel Eyes is The Bad he has honor. If The Ugly were to be in Angel Eyes' situation he would have taken the money from Soup Man and not have gone through with the job. So now we have to think. Who is the better man, a scoundrel or the Bad?Finally we meet The Good. We find out that he is working with The Ugly and that the two are con men. What they do is this The Good turns in The Ugly for a reward. He takes the money and then frees The Ugly. Then they split the cost and repeat. Now we must once again start to question morals here. The Good is not literally good, as he does bad things. However, deep down he has a heart of good and in the end will usually choose the wiser, more moral route than the other characters we meet. One thing I love about this film is how even though there are three separate characters doing three separate things--The Good and The Ugly eventually split off--they all coordinate with each other in the end. One thing that happens in the beginning of the film at one location may come back to haunt certain characters later in the film at a completely different location. Let's take Elam for instance. In the very beginning of the film he and his two partners are shot by The Ugly. Then two whole hours later Elam find The Ugly and tries to kill him. This doesn't work out too well as The Ugly apparently bathes with his gun. Other moments like this occur throughout the film which adds realism to the story.The most critical point of joining these three together by chance is when the plot is revealed to our trio. We already know that The Bad is after a certain amount of gold, but The Good and The Ugly don't know about this gold or Bill Carson until an hour into the film and the only reason this happens if because of great character development. See after The Good has left The Ugly in the desert to die, The Ugly finds The Good and gives him the same punishment. Whilst doing so we begin the absolutely hate The Ugly as he torments The Good. While in the desert they find Bill Carson, the man who The Bad is looking for. The Ugly is told the location of where the treasure is hidden, a cemetery. The Good is told the name of the grave. Now the tables have turned as The Ugly must keep The Good alive in order to find the treasure. Shortly after The Bad, who by the way is a army captain, finds the two and The Ugly poses as Bill Carson. Soon The bad tortures The Ugly and we once again question our thinking. We saw The Ugly earlier being just awful to The Good but now we are sympathizing toward him because of the bad. From here I will reveal no more of the plot, as this is a movie you need to see and I do not want to have it spoiled for you. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is a masterpiece. Not only is it a brilliant Western but also a film. It has an outstanding plot, cinematography, acting, music, and directing. For all of these reasons I give The Good, the Bad and the Ugly a 10 out of 10.

A heist goes horribly wrong and the remaining criminals try to work out who the police informant is. It's set mostly in one location, and as the tension builds in the gangster's hideout the film becomes so unbearably intense it threatens to explode through the screen. Less a film, more a mind blowing, pulse pounding powerhouse, Reservoir Dogs is certainly one of the defining films of the 90s. It's quite a disturbing film at times and those who are squeamish should stay away. The violence makes the movie even more powerful, but it does get nasty at times. The film could be seen as style over substance by some and it won't be everyone's cup of tea; however, you can't really find anything else like it. Aside from Quentin Tarantino's other films of course. The film unfolds in non linear storytelling but unlike with Pulp Fiction, which was non linear just to show off, this adds to the plot and makes it even tenser.Tarantino has a very dynamic and explosive visual style which enhances the brutal action, and you'll be on the edge of your seat for all 90 minutes. His dialogue is even better though, and he should have won an Oscar for his writing. The script is enthralling to listen to, and it has fine actors speaking the dialogue as well, with Tim Roth being the highlight. Reservoir Dogs is special because it refuses to be boxed in or respond to conventions. It doesn't show the heist properly, the characters are always talking about things irrelevant to the plot and the violence is unflinching and explosive. This kind of movie just isn't seen much... well, ever. It's consistently entertaining from beginning to end (for those who can stomach the violence) and bizarrely enthralling. An extremely energetic and well made film which has deservedly influenced pop culture massively. You may hate it, but you can't deny the power of the dialogue or its originality.10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"6 December 2014","score":"","review":" Although I'm not a huge fan of Pulp Fiction, Quentin Tarantino's debut is one of the best independent films of all time.

A mysterious plot, check, Bruce Willis takes the leading role, check, and a twist at the end, check. But the movie is more than that. In my opinion this is Shyamalan's best work so far. I still regret how biased everyone is after the 6th Sense and what a pity, this movie was not made before the other one. Even now, you can observe there is a prequel-sequel thing going on, people didn't recognize how great and fresh this movie actually is. It is not a remake. Go see this movie unbiased and if you pay attention to all the details, you may fall in love and be surprised how good it actually is. It is more than just good.Unbreakable has everything, structure, great acting, a simple but complex story, fitting score, superb camera work with masterful use of the color palette. This should be a fine example of film making. The twist at the end is just a bonus, a pay off, but it doesn't matter much really, it's everything before and after, the rewatch-ability. And the tone nails it. For me it works very well, quiet but intense and like the train in the first scene the pacing gets faster and faster.Unbreakable is a real life adaption of a superhero's tail. The plot is set in a serious, realistic environment. Bruce Willis is the hero, who leads a double life (within his family) and has to fight against two villains. One evil minded and genius, an insane mastermind and counterpart of the hero (Samuel Jackson), the other one is quite the opposite, a no- brainer who uses brutal force and the hero has to fight him with pure strength.What I find interesting about the story is that you learn everything from Jackson, you hear his dubious explanations and you start to believe him, but at the same time you doubt it and more and more you get to realize how insane Jackson's perspective really is.Like I mentioned, the use of the color palette is supreme. Not only the pro and antagonists has different &#x84;costumes with certain colors, they also used different camera filters to set different moods in the scenes. There are three colors used in the hero-villains triangle green, violet and orange. It may goes over the head of most part of the audience, but these colors were not chosen randomly. They are secondary colors according to the traditional RYB color model. Blue and yellow pigments together equal green and green is in the middle of the colors spectrum it is an equally balanced color and represents here our superhero's virtues, a mixture of intelligence and strength. Both villains (represented by the colors violet and orange) share one of those virtues. Also one primary color of green (blue and yellow) with one particular color added, which our hero doesn't have red, which represents evil. Violet and orange, the colors of the villains, are on opposing sites of the colors spectrum. It is very subtle, but this allegory works out.Does all this make the movie any better? Not really, and most people wont even notice it. But I admire that they put this in the movie on purpose. Visually I am very attracted to this movie. The camera work is great. But Unbreakable is also a fine character study with subtle and good acting. The script reveals a real arc for every character, especially for the protagonist.

This should be a fine example of film making. The twist at the end is just a bonus, a pay off, but it doesn't matter much really, it's everything before and after, the rewatch-ability. And the tone nails it. For me it works very well, quiet but intense and like the train in the first scene the pacing gets faster and faster.Unbreakable is a real life adaption of a superhero's tail. The plot is set in a serious, realistic environment. Bruce Willis is the hero, who leads a double life (within his family) and has to fight against two villains. One evil minded and genius, an insane mastermind and counterpart of the hero (Samuel Jackson), the other one is quite the opposite, a no- brainer who uses brutal force and the hero has to fight him with pure strength.What I find interesting about the story is that you learn everything from Jackson, you hear his dubious explanations and you start to believe him, but at the same time you doubt it and more and more you get to realize how insane Jackson's perspective really is.Like I mentioned, the use of the color palette is supreme. Not only the pro and antagonists has different &#x84;costumes with certain colors, they also used different camera filters to set different moods in the scenes. There are three colors used in the hero-villains triangle green, violet and orange. It may goes over the head of most part of the audience, but these colors were not chosen randomly. They are secondary colors according to the traditional RYB color model. Blue and yellow pigments together equal green and green is in the middle of the colors spectrum it is an equally balanced color and represents here our superhero's virtues, a mixture of intelligence and strength. Both villains (represented by the colors violet and orange) share one of those virtues. Also one primary color of green (blue and yellow) with one particular color added, which our hero doesn't have red, which represents evil. Violet and orange, the colors of the villains, are on opposing sites of the colors spectrum. It is very subtle, but this allegory works out.Does all this make the movie any better? Not really, and most people wont even notice it. But I admire that they put this in the movie on purpose. Visually I am very attracted to this movie. The camera work is great. But Unbreakable is also a fine character study with subtle and good acting. The script reveals a real arc for every character, especially for the protagonist. In addition Willis performance in this movie is in my humble opinion his best.

John Katzenberg was a huge name at pixar but left shortly after Toy Story came out. Disney and pixar where already working on their next CG animated film about bugs. Katzenberg left to start Dreamworks and he thought that he had the rights to that story. So, it was a race to see who could get their CG animated bug film into cinemas first. That summer, we got two animated bug films a few weeks apart. They were Antz and A Bug's Life. It was very strange. I will compare these two films. The plot sounds similar but the films are quite different. Antz was ore of a Woody Allen movie but as an animated flick. A Bug's Life is more child friendly and colorful. Personally, I think Antz has the better story but this is not a review about that film. This film is about an ant named Flick, who is part of a colony of ants who constantly feed their food to the grasshoppers. They are lead by the villain, Spacey, who is basically a bully who likes to pick on the smaller ants. Flick doesn't like this, so he sets out in seek of a group of warrior bugs to come in and fight the grasshoppers. He finds a group of circus bugs mistaken for warriors. The circus bugs just think they are getting a gig but when they find out the truth, they try to flee, only to discover they might have a decent plan to get rid of the grasshoppers. Then, its a race to try and get the plan ready in time. As a follow up to Toy Story, this is pretty weak. It is bright and colorful but the writing is not as strong as it was in Toy Story. It's kind of the opposite in some points. Toy Story had a simple set up with well written characters. This is a complex set up with basic characters. You know exactly who the heroes and villains are. None of the ants are really that memorable. I don't remember anything about them. The only thing I do remember is the circus bugs. They are the highlight of the film. Dennis Leary as a ladybug, David Hyde Pierce as the stick bug, two acrobatic bugs, a ditsy black widow, a fortune teller who is blind and a caterpillar with a thick accent. The chemistry between these characters is believable and hilarious. Anything with those characters are great. The rest of the film is kind of bland. Is it terrible? No but the liar reveal story is annoying. The movie is very predictable and we needed better characters. At the end of the day, it's not bad, just bland. For me, this was quite weak but to Toy Story, this is tiny.

It was such a different take on the old west and life of an outlaw than I'd seen before, or that anyone had seen for that matter. More playful than even John Ford's most light hearted works, but without the sappiness of the old singing cowboy comedies, it made the west seem like not only a grand adventure, but also great fun. With its oddball sense of humor and the interplay between its two stars, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is both a great western and perhaps the best buddy comedy Hollywood ever made.As the title suggests, the film follows the exploits of two of the Wild West's most infamous outlaws, who with their Hole in the Wall Gang robbed banks and trains far and wide, earning themselves a reputation as some of the move dangerous men alive. But you'd never know it if you met them. Far from hardened outlaws, Butch and Sundance are friendly, laid back cutups who find enjoyment where they can and never take life too seriously. Charming to a fault, they're even nice to the people they're robbing. They're not really bad men you see; they just have expensive tastes and a strong aversion to hard work.Whether it's a narrow getaway, a stick up, or a friendly visit to the nearest brothel, everything they touch becomes good natured fun, and it all works because of the men playing them. Hiring Paul Newman and then newcomer Robert Redford as Butch and Sundance was one the great happy coincidences in Hollywood history, like casting Ingrid Bergman opposite Humphrey Bogart, and began an on screen partnership even more enduring. The chemistry between these men is incredible; even knowing this was their first film together it's hard to believe they hadn't known each other all their lives.On their own each man has exceptional wit and charisma. Together they're the perfect comedic duo; Butch the talkative joker, Sundance the tight lipped strait man. Never overplaying their shtick, they always lay on just the right amount of humor. When times are good they're like a pair of schoolboys playing hooky. When times are bad they're worse than an old married couple.Of course not all the credit goes to the actors. The director and the screenplay are crucial to the film's ability to keep its cheery tone. Even when Butch and Sundance are running for their lives, hounded by the best lawmen and trackers in the west, it's no reason for things to get serious. Now they're just a couple of saps who can't catch a break, leading them to a harebrained stunt that remains one of the screen's great moments of physical comedy.Much of the film's humor and charm come from its dialogue, yet at times it accomplishes a great amount with no words at all. The New York montage condenses the story of their fun in the big city and their departure for South America into a few brief moments, the series of black and white stills and old timey waltzes and carnival music wonderfully evocative of the period. An entire string of Bolivian robberies likewise becomes a cheerful musical interlude.And speaking of musical interludes, the whole movie is so carefree and delightfully screwball that it even manages to make the dreaded Semi-Obligatory Lyrical Interlude- in which lover's engage in pleasant activities that have nothing to do with the plot- work. Rationally there's no reason why a scene of Paul Newman riding a bicycle with a woman we've just met should follow a train robbery, but here it's so charming that we either forget that or just don't car. There's simply something magical about watching Newman and Katherine Ross peddling around that meadow, and his wordless 'daredevil' scene is the best thing since Buster Keaton.Yet the good times can't last forever, certainly not for men in their line of work. The fact is that the world they know is passing away. The Wild West isn't as wild as it used to be, and their profession is rapidly becoming a thing of the past. They realize this and go halfway around the world to a place that's still wild and lawless in an attempt to forestall it. It works for a while, but it's only so long before their past starts to catch up with them. In the blink of an eye things turn deadly serious, and we realize that the world's closing in on them and they can't escape it, no matter how far they go.

True, many have tried to imitate it, and in the thirty odd years since its release it has influenced countless movies, TV series, anime and video games to one degree or another. Yet while all of these have copied elements of it, none of them have ever captured its exact balance of sci-fi, noir, and philosophy, or replicated its unique atmosphere and otherworldly feel. And none of them had Harrison Ford in the lead and Ridley Scott in the director's chair.For those few not familiar with the story, Ford plays Rick Deckard, a detective tasked with tracking and eliminating replicants, genetic constructs made to perfectly mimic the humans they serve. Since an incident years before, replicants have been banned from earth, upon penalty of death. But now four of them have taken that risk, leaving a wake of death behind them as they search for the key to their very existence. And it's up to Deckard to find them and stop them before they strike again.Their leader, Roy, is easily one of the most menacing villains ever to grace the screen. He is so perfect it's unsettling. Gifted with the looks of a professional model and the body and athleticism of a champion quarterback, his every word and expression exudes keen intelligence- and unmistakable madness. He is the kind of being who knows exactly what he wants and how to get it, and he is not the type to let anything or anyone get in his way. Nor is he the only thing Deckard has to worry about We don't see enough of Leon or Zhora to get much of an impression of them, beyond the fact that they too are desperate and dangerous. Priss however we see very much of; in more ways than one. Beautiful, alluring, and manipulative, she's like a deadly exotic flower, drawing you in to suffocate you in her poison. And then there's Rachel, the replicant who doesn't know she's a replicant. Her demeanor, clothing, and her ever present cigarette remind one of a down and out moll in an old detective movie. Though she barely knows who she really is, she could be a useful ally to Deckard, or possibly something much more.One of the things that sticks with you the most about this movie is the incredible atmosphere that pervades it. Like any good dystopian sci-fi or hard-boiled detective movie, everything here is dark, heavy, and more than a little threatening. The LA of 2019 is crowded, dirty, and run down. Chinese writing and noodle stands are everywhere, as if Chinatown has overrun all LA. Hover cars fly over decaying apartment blocks and flashing theater matinées out of pre Giuliani Manhattan while fantastic monads and pyramids loom over the horizon like a latter day Babylon. Inside the futuristic and the antiquated vie as well in rooms filled with computer screens and electrical tubing alongside candelabras and crumbling plasterwork. And endless rain comes down in sheets over it all, running down every crevice and drenching any who brave the streets. Everywhere neon signs, industrial flares, and searchlights illuminate the cityscape, yet nowhere is it enough to hold back the shadows which bathe the streets. For it's the shadows- both physical and metaphorical- that make the world within the film. The director and cinematographers do as many things with these shadows as the best expressionist filmmaker. They use them to alternately obscure and draw attention to faces and scenery, to heighten the sense of danger and mystery, to create harsh contrasts with the blinding strobes and searchlights. And they remind us that everything that's happening is happening within the shadows of society, the dirty underbelly unseen by the good folks safe in their homes. And just as well that it is. For this is a world filled with violence and corruption not fit for innocent eyes, and the filmmaker's don't let you forget it for a moment, especially not in the action scenes. With slow motion and bluesy synth music, Zhara's death is as stylized and artificial as anything in Blade Runner's world. Yet at the same time it's drawn out, bloody, even traumatic. The editing and camera work aren't trying to make it look cool, they're emphasizing the fact that a desperate frightened woman is dying alone on a rainy sidewalk. To paraphrase the film's most famous line, the report may read routine retirement of a replicant, but it won't make Deckard feel any better about shooting a woman in the back. Yet for all its impact this scene doesn't even begin to compare with the finale. Deckard's final showdown with Roy is mesmerizing in its beauty and brutality; a demented fever dream hunt, like Most Dangerous Game blended with Olympia and German expressionist horror. Even out of his mind and with his body betraying him, Roy is the superior combatant to Deckard in every way. In a strait on fight to the finish it would all be over in an instant. But what we get instead is so much more violent, intriguing, and spellbinding. And in the end it leaves us with so many questions to ponder; about memory, morality, and what it truly means to be human.

Though she barely knows who she really is, she could be a useful ally to Deckard, or possibly something much more.One of the things that sticks with you the most about this movie is the incredible atmosphere that pervades it. Like any good dystopian sci-fi or hard-boiled detective movie, everything here is dark, heavy, and more than a little threatening. The LA of 2019 is crowded, dirty, and run down. Chinese writing and noodle stands are everywhere, as if Chinatown has overrun all LA. Hover cars fly over decaying apartment blocks and flashing theater matinées out of pre Giuliani Manhattan while fantastic monads and pyramids loom over the horizon like a latter day Babylon. Inside the futuristic and the antiquated vie as well in rooms filled with computer screens and electrical tubing alongside candelabras and crumbling plasterwork. And endless rain comes down in sheets over it all, running down every crevice and drenching any who brave the streets. Everywhere neon signs, industrial flares, and searchlights illuminate the cityscape, yet nowhere is it enough to hold back the shadows which bathe the streets. For it's the shadows- both physical and metaphorical- that make the world within the film. The director and cinematographers do as many things with these shadows as the best expressionist filmmaker. They use them to alternately obscure and draw attention to faces and scenery, to heighten the sense of danger and mystery, to create harsh contrasts with the blinding strobes and searchlights. And they remind us that everything that's happening is happening within the shadows of society, the dirty underbelly unseen by the good folks safe in their homes. And just as well that it is. For this is a world filled with violence and corruption not fit for innocent eyes, and the filmmaker's don't let you forget it for a moment, especially not in the action scenes. With slow motion and bluesy synth music, Zhara's death is as stylized and artificial as anything in Blade Runner's world. Yet at the same time it's drawn out, bloody, even traumatic. The editing and camera work aren't trying to make it look cool, they're emphasizing the fact that a desperate frightened woman is dying alone on a rainy sidewalk. To paraphrase the film's most famous line, the report may read routine retirement of a replicant, but it won't make Deckard feel any better about shooting a woman in the back. Yet for all its impact this scene doesn't even begin to compare with the finale. Deckard's final showdown with Roy is mesmerizing in its beauty and brutality; a demented fever dream hunt, like Most Dangerous Game blended with Olympia and German expressionist horror. Even out of his mind and with his body betraying him, Roy is the superior combatant to Deckard in every way. In a strait on fight to the finish it would all be over in an instant. But what we get instead is so much more violent, intriguing, and spellbinding. And in the end it leaves us with so many questions to ponder; about memory, morality, and what it truly means to be human.

True, many have tried to imitate it, and in the thirty odd years since its release it has influenced countless movies, TV series, anime and video games to one degree or another. Yet while all of these have copied elements of it, none of them have ever captured its exact balance of sci-fi, noir, and philosophy, or replicated its unique atmosphere and otherworldly feel. And none of them had Harrison Ford in the lead and Ridley Scott in the director's chair.For those few not familiar with the story, Ford plays Rick Deckard, a detective tasked with tracking and eliminating replicants, genetic constructs made to perfectly mimic the humans they serve. Since an incident years before, replicants have been banned from earth, upon penalty of death. But now four of them have taken that risk, leaving a wake of death behind them as they search for the key to their very existence.

Along the way, the stage is held up, and one of the passengers, Cicero Grimes, turns out to be the ringleader. We then find out that Dr. Favor has been embezzling funds by starving the Indians, and the bandits steal the money he has with him. But things get complicated when Russell kills a couple of them, getting back the money, which he intends to return to the Indians. The rest of the movie is a struggle between the two groups of people, until Russell ends up losing his life rescuing Mrs. Favor. The irony is that Russell dislikes Mrs. Favor because she expressed contempt for the Indians.It has occurred to some that Mrs. Favor may have been in on it. It certainly is an interpretation that makes sense of some of the peculiar things that happen in this movie. From what we can gather, Dr. Favor has been embezzling the Indians for years. For some reason, he suddenly decides to take the money and run. Perhaps he found out that the Federal Government was sending someone to San Carlos to do an audit, and he figured he would get out before the embezzlement was discovered. So, using the excuse the he and Mrs. Favor were going to Bisbee for a couple of days to settle some affairs, they go into town to take the stagecoach, intending to go to Mexico.And yet, when they get to town, the heist is all set up. Not only do the bandits know that Dr. Favor has been stealing from the Indians, but they also know that he has chosen just this moment to make off with the money, and that he and his wife intend to take the stage. Furthermore, because most of these bandits were from out of town, they had to know about Favor's intention to abscond well in advance, so they could ride into the area and get things ready. Presumably, they had inside information. And a likely source would be Mrs. Favor. She could have been having an affair with Grimes, and during some pillow talk, told him about the money and exactly when she and her husband would be taking the stage.After the robbery takes place, Grimes says to Mrs. Favor, I figured you'd ride along with us a way. And Mrs. Favor says, I'd better not. I'd better not? That is not what an attractive woman says when she is about to be abducted by a bunch of desperadoes that, she has every reason to fear, will gang rape her and leave her for dead in the desert. What we would expect her to do is scream.By way of contrast, consider the movie Niagara (1953). Marilyn Monroe is married to Joseph Cotten, who is very jealous and possessive. One night some young adults who are staying at the same hotel are having an outdoor party. Marilyn asks a young man to play her favorite record for her. He does, and then he asks her to dance. She looks over at her hotel room and sees her husband watching her through the window. She turns back to the young man and says, I'd better not.Now, that is where that line makes sense, when a woman is worried about making her husband jealous. What would explain this is that Mrs. Favor and Grimes planned this robbery, and they agreed that she would rendezvous with him later in Mexico. This sudden change in plans worries her, for it might make her husband suspicious, especially since he has had time to wonder, as we do, just how the bandits knew so much about his plans.Finally, when Grimes is shot three times trying to get down the hill, he collapses in the doorway of the small shack. Mrs. Favor drags him inside, saving him from being shot any further. This would suggest that she cares about Grimes, confirming the theory that they were having an affair. On the other hand, this could be an instance of the Stockholm syndrome. In fact, just prior to Grimes' being shot, he asks her if she wants to send her husband a message, and she says, Tell him I'm being well looked after, which is characteristic as a victim, she might be grateful that she has not been raped, thereby bonding with her captor. Furthermore, since they are alone in that scene, we would expect some kind of communication between them making it explicit that they were in cahoots, if indeed they were, but nothing of that sort is forthcoming.Let us further undermine the case against Mrs. Favor. A running theme through the movie is the irrational way white people, from Russell's Apache perspective, will stick together and protect one another even after acts of betrayal. That Mrs. Favor would drag Grimes to safety would be just one more instance of this. That he would subsequently tie her up to a post in the hot sun without water would simply underscore Russell's attitude that white people are foolish to be so trusting and forgiving of one another.Finally, since the sheriff was also in on the job, he might, as a law-enforcement officer, have gotten wind of Favor's treatment of the Indians, and might have also found out through someone connected to the reservation that Dr. Favor seemed awfully anxious to make that so-called trip to Bisbee.In short, while there is a strong circumstantial case that can be made that Mrs. Favor was in on it, it is equally possible to make the case that she is innocent, at least in the sense that she did not betray her husband.

This sudden change in plans worries her, for it might make her husband suspicious, especially since he has had time to wonder, as we do, just how the bandits knew so much about his plans.Finally, when Grimes is shot three times trying to get down the hill, he collapses in the doorway of the small shack. Mrs. Favor drags him inside, saving him from being shot any further. This would suggest that she cares about Grimes, confirming the theory that they were having an affair. On the other hand, this could be an instance of the Stockholm syndrome. In fact, just prior to Grimes' being shot, he asks her if she wants to send her husband a message, and she says, Tell him I'm being well looked after, which is characteristic as a victim, she might be grateful that she has not been raped, thereby bonding with her captor. Furthermore, since they are alone in that scene, we would expect some kind of communication between them making it explicit that they were in cahoots, if indeed they were, but nothing of that sort is forthcoming.Let us further undermine the case against Mrs. Favor. A running theme through the movie is the irrational way white people, from Russell's Apache perspective, will stick together and protect one another even after acts of betrayal. That Mrs. Favor would drag Grimes to safety would be just one more instance of this. That he would subsequently tie her up to a post in the hot sun without water would simply underscore Russell's attitude that white people are foolish to be so trusting and forgiving of one another.Finally, since the sheriff was also in on the job, he might, as a law-enforcement officer, have gotten wind of Favor's treatment of the Indians, and might have also found out through someone connected to the reservation that Dr. Favor seemed awfully anxious to make that so-called trip to Bisbee.In short, while there is a strong circumstantial case that can be made that Mrs. Favor was in on it, it is equally possible to make the case that she is innocent, at least in the sense that she did not betray her husband.

Clyde Barrow (Warren Beatty) and Bonnie Parker (Faye Dunaway) were two such young people in the 1930's, who robbed banks and gunned down lawmen largely because they had nothing better to do. Joined by Clyde's brother Buck (Gene Hackman), his high-strung wife Blanche, and their bumbling getaway man CW Moss, they cut a swath across the Midwest and became the most notorious outlaws since Jesse James before meeting their end in a hail of bullets.The oddest yet most alluring thing about the gang (at least as portrayed here) is despite the numerous felonies they commit, they don't seem like bad people. They come across less as hardened killers than awkward young lovers who wanted fame, fortune, and excitement, and decided the only way to find them was to go outside the law. At first, they succeed almost in spite of themselves, making rookie mistakes like robbing a recently failed bank. Even when they hit their stride, the satisfaction of a successful stick-up is eclipsed by the excitement of reading about their exploits in the paper and in becoming household names.And despite the rapid body count they amass, they never seem to relish the violence. They don't mind firing a few shots into the air, just to scare folks, but they don't shoot anyone unless they have to. For them, shootouts are an unwelcome danger that gets in the way of their real business, and killing someone is only further reason for the law to track them down, and maybe something to feel guilty over. After a struggle in grocery store results in serious injury to the proprietor, Clyde complains to Bonny Why did he have to go and do that? Ain't got nothing against him.Together with the rest of the gang, they're almost like a big, thieving, murdering family. They have their fights and falling outs, and they make up. They get homesick. They have their personality clashes, with Bonnie and Blanche barely tolerating each other. Between Blanche's excitability, Buck's hick ways and corny jokes, and CW's good natured idiocy, much of the film has a cheery, even humorous feel. Nowhere is this truer than during the shootout in Joplin. Bullets are flying everywhere and cops are dropping left and right, but the sight of Blanche running across the yard waving her arms, screaming her lungs out, and generally making a complete fool of herself renders the scene absolutely hilarious. But despite the not infrequent comic relief, Bonnie and Clyde is no lighthearted comedy. They are wanted men and women, and danger is never far from them. In reflective moments, Clyde and Bonnie readily admit that they'll someday go out in a hail of bullets- people in their line of work don't tend to have long and happy lives. And throughout the final reel, it becomes clear that the end is drawing closer. As the number of lawmen on their trail increases, the shootouts become bigger and bloodier, the escapes become ever narrower, and their luck begins to fail, until finally the young lovers meet their destiny on a quiet country back road.These scenes, especially the latter, were larger, far bloodier, and more realistic than any put on film up to that point. Up until then, most movie violence had been largely bloodless, with actors merely grimacing or slumping over when shot, and the more horrific violence merely being implied. But Bonnie and Clyde dared to show what really happens when lead meets flesh. The now famous death scene shocked audiences upon the film's release in 1967, and is still powerful more than forty years later. It's no understatement to say that Bonnie and Clyde paved the way for nearly every modern shoot-em-up, from The Wild Bunch to Scarface.Perhaps what really makes Bonnie and Clyde special is that although it had the subject, and the budget, of a quickie exploitation film, Penn treated the material with nuance and style, giving us real people with hopes, dreams, and emotions of their own, and making graphic violence and human sexuality worthy of high cinema. With powerful performances by Beatty and Dunaway, groundbreaking effects work, and its then unique mix of gun play, humor, and personal drama, Bonnie and Clyde did more than any sensationalist headline to create the mystique that surrounds its protagonist to this day, and heralded the arrival of new wave cinema to the US. This was, and is, one of the great American movies.
