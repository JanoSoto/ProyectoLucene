If you want a documentary on medieval England, go somewhere else. If you want a lighthearted, fun, and downright clever film with a wicked sense of humor, you've come to the right place.I first saw this movie when it hit DVD back in '01, maybe '02, I can't really remember...it's been so long, and I've watched it so many times since then I can't even count. Whenever I'm staring blankly at my DVD collection trying to decide what to watch, I know I can put this on and have a good time. I've always thought all the modern references (Nike, John Deere, the music) are really funny. I mean, come on, they're so blatant you just know they're having a good time. I'm not sure what all the hangup is about the inaccuracies. A movie that starts out with We Will Rock You in medieval England is not meant to be taken too seriously.On the other hand, something I did not see at first--and now have a very great appreciation and respect for--is the incorporation of Geoffrey Chaucer (real and fictitious). Of course I think Paul Bettany just steals the show. (God I'm good!) But more importantly, the references to the real Chaucer and his real work, _The Canterbury Tales_. Those of you who know them will know that there is one called _The Knight's Tale_, about a very upstanding, chivalrous knight (the only completely moral character in _Canterbury Tales_), hence Chaucer's line I'm gonna have to write some of this down. We also get to meet the Pardoner and the Summoner, who were both horrid characters. (Peter, a humble pardoner, and purveyor of religious relics. Which he is, in the story.) I was amazed at how much more appreciation I got for this movie after reading Chaucer's work.So yes, this is a fun, slightly satirical romp, no doubt about it, and even if you haven't read _The Canterbury Tales_ I really recommend it.

The life of this 14 year old West Berlin junkie is crafted with an astounding level of realism. Her downward spiral into heroin addiction and prostitution is captured by Ulrich Edel, who holds nothing back in his depiction. We see through Christiane's eyes, every filthy toilet, every creepy, slimy john whom she must trick with for drug money, every moment of terror and desperation. At this age, everything is felt so intensely. Christiane, a young teenager from a hell on Earth place called Gropistadt, a truly dark and bleak part of Neukoln, West Berlin. A place where there is absolutely nothing for a teenager to do. She discovers a place called The Sound, a cavernous disco located near the posh and touristy Kurfuerstendamm. The Sound is a seedy teen hangout, infested with drugs, and with dealers only too happy to feed Valium and heroin to kids eager to escape their dreary reality and to have fun. Here is where Christiane meets Detlef, a boy her age. Detlef starts using heroin soon after they meet, and Christiane, scared of losing him to the drug, begins using also. It is especially important to notice that the film doesn't glamorize heroin. As soon as the hard drug use begins, the mood of the film changes instantly. The wonderful music of David Bowie whom Christiane worships is heard frequently throughout the first section of the film. After her and her friends become junkies, the Bowie music disappears, which is very symbolic, i think. Thankfully director Edel didn't make the mistake that so many American directors make when filming stories about teens The actors here are genuine teenagers, around 14\/15 years old. This makes the film so much more powerful and shocking, and much more believable. The effects of heroin on these kids is staggering to behold; they turn into these sickly shadows of their former selves, like zombies, in search of their next fix. And strangely, Christiane and her friends never seem to enjoy the high from the heroin. You will never see such a bleak vision of kids lost in a surreal hell of drug addiction. And to add further to the intensity, the film is long, 138 minutes uncut, becoming steadily darker and seedier by the minute, until the viewer wonders just how long can this young girl go on like this without completely self-destructing. And amazingly, throughout the running time, the film never preaches, not for a moment. And it never becomes sentimental, as most American drug films often do. The film style is specifically German. I doubt that any American director could have created such a dark and gritty film about people so young.

For starters, the film is based on a novel, and it is also known that Eastwood fired the man who was going to direct it (Philip Kaufman, also the screenwriter) when the project was already in an advanced stage.Clint Eastwood stars as Josie Whales, a pacific farmer who sees his family killed during the American Civil war, and who, not having any good reason to live but to achieve revenge, joins the suddist irregulars. And here the strange things start to ocurr, because after the beginning credits the war is over and Whales is in more or less the same state where we left him. A series of events turn him into a fugitive, with literally every bounty hunter in the territory after him, and his dry, sullen persona starts to evolve as his journey towards Kansas progresses and he joins some of the most peculiar travel partners ever to grace a western a young kid (Sam Bottons), a disenchanted Indian chief (Chief Dan George), an Indian woman who speaks in an unintelligible tongue, a dog, a puritan woman and her aloof young daughter (played by Sondra Locke, future companion and regular screen partner of Eastwood).It is a wonderful film, really, but as I said it is VERY strange. It starts as your usual Eastwood vehicle, although Eastwood's tone as a director is even more laconic and dryly humorous than usual, but as the journey progresses new characters are introduced and Wales himself starts to change, developing, just like the film itself, and underlying schizophrenia. Wales is teared apart, as the film goes, between his desire for revenge and thus ending with his inner torment, and the newly found desire to reintegrate to society (he's been a loner for years as the film starts), as he founds himself as the leader of some sort of dysfunctional, even interracial, family.This inner conflict is also transferred to the film itself, which seems to eternally debate between historical (and genre) accuracy (this must be the most historical of all Eastwood films, as it is based on historical events and several real figures like Quantril are mentioned) and Eastwood's desire to short-circuit it with dry humour and anti-archeotypical character allegiances.This alone should make it a must see for all westerns aficionados, but it should also be noted that this is one of Eastwood's finest directing efforts. Attention to detail is overwhelming (notice for instance the use of period songs), and the cinematography is absolutely riveting, coating the interiors with persistent shadows, and washing out the familiar landscapes with invernal light.

Which was supposed to be the final Friday the 13th movie but sadly in a way, it wasn't. This one is notable for some pleasing supporting performances by Crispin Glover as a would-be stud, Lawrence Monoson as his horny rude buddy and Feldman as Jarvis. White is appropriately scary and intense as Jason. This one is also noteworthy for Tom Savini's excellent make-up effects and the knock-out conclusion. Savini's make-up on Jason is certainly closer to the original design work he did on the first one, compare to Jason's look on Part 2 and Part 3.This has plenty of interesting characters, although the movie was cut for time. Which studio Paramount probably forced directorZito cut a lot of character development to make the picture in a 90 minute format. Some of Savini's effects work were trimmed for R-Rating. Like the sequels, this one has a few plot holes. Good example would be Tommy Jarvis' mother (Played by Joan Freeman), she killed by Jason off-screen but we never knew what happen to her body.

The finished product might not be particularly great, but the central idea upon which the entire story is built is very impressive indeed. Dreams are such a weird and personal phenomena. They throw up so many fascinating possibilities and questions. And most importantly of all, EVERYONE has dreams, which means that Dreamscape is a film that people can identify with universally.Psychic Alex Gardner (Dennid Quaid) joins a dream research project run by ambitious scientist Dr Paul Novotny (Max Von Sydow). Dr Novotny has devised a sophisticated laboratory where he can carry out these studies of dreams. More innovatively, the doctor has also made a breakthrough in the idea of dream-linking, a process by which one person can enter another's dreams and have a direct influence over the events taking place. Gardner becomes a dream linker and learns how to enter the dreams of other people. During his dream linking he has various outlandish experiences, including helping an insecure man to catch his wife having sex with his brother, and helping a young nightmare-plagued boy to defeat a snake-man who haunts his dreams. Gardner also dream links with one of Dr Novotny's pretty assistants, Dr Jane Devries (Kate Capshaw), and together they share an erotic fantasy. The research takes a turn for the sinister when the President of the USA (Eddie Albert) comes forth admitting that he has been experiencing recurring nightmares about a nuclear holocaust. Gardner has begun to suspect that dream linkers may have the power to murder people in their dreams, thereby causing them to die in real life. He figures out that government conspirator Bob Blair (Christopher Plummer) has pumped funding into the dream research project, but all along has harboured the ulterior motive of sending in an assassin to kill the President in his dreams. Gardner is the only person who knows of the assassination plot, so he enters the President's dreams to protect him from the dream-linking assassin, Tommy Ray Glatman (David Patrick Kelly).Dreamscape is imaginative and rather philosophical stuff, with enjoyable dream sequences. The special effects are a little dated, especially during the snake man sequence, but for the time are just about acceptable. Quaid gives a likable performance as the reluctant hero, with Von Sydow in his usual commanding form as the innovative scientist in charge of the research. Kate Capshaw is attractive and intelligent as the love interest (it's a shame she never got stronger roles after this), while Plummer does another of his shadowy villain roles with customary silky menace. The film eventually settles down to become a political-assassination thriller, and at this point the fantastical, limitless possibilities inherent in the story suddenly become all too conventional.

Gardner is the only person who knows of the assassination plot, so he enters the President's dreams to protect him from the dream-linking assassin, Tommy Ray Glatman (David Patrick Kelly).Dreamscape is imaginative and rather philosophical stuff, with enjoyable dream sequences. The special effects are a little dated, especially during the snake man sequence, but for the time are just about acceptable. Quaid gives a likable performance as the reluctant hero, with Von Sydow in his usual commanding form as the innovative scientist in charge of the research. Kate Capshaw is attractive and intelligent as the love interest (it's a shame she never got stronger roles after this), while Plummer does another of his shadowy villain roles with customary silky menace. The film eventually settles down to become a political-assassination thriller, and at this point the fantastical, limitless possibilities inherent in the story suddenly become all too conventional. But, for the majority of the way, Dreamscape is an enjoyable and thought-provoking film.

In the case of Western, this revolution happened in the 60s, however, the previous decade brought three films that were of huge importance for that change High Noon, Shane and The Searchers. Of the three, George Stevens' Shane may be the less complex in terms of story, but it has a surreal aura of ambiguity that shows the film's true caliber and makes it reach mythical levels.At its core, Shane, is the tale of a lonely traveler named Shane (Alan Ladd), who on his way through the plains meets the Starretts, a family of settlers who are being abused by cattleman Rufus Ryker (Emile Meyer), who claims the settler's land as his own. Shane decides to stay with the family and to work for Joe Starret (Van Heflin), quickly being accepted by the family, specially by little Joey (Brandon De Wilde), who idolizes Shane for his skill as a gunfighter. And soon this skill will come handy as Ryker's actions become more and more violent.However, Shane is not only about the family being helped by Shane, the story (based on Jack Schaefer's novel) explores Shane's attempts to attempts to settle down and the inner conflicts that make him go back to violence, making it the story to be also the tale of Shane being helped by the Starretts. And from here a whole series of conflicts arise, as the mysterious Shane becomes part of a community that both loves him and fears him, and this constant battle with his past makes one of the most important themes of the film. Even when we have no idea of Shane's past, it's all evident that it's not a nice one, and that it inevitably will return to haunt him.Director George Stevens took this complex tale of honor and transformed it into a mythical portrayal of the American West. With a superb cinematography (that won an Oscar) and an excellent use of color, Stevens delivers the perfect combination of the real West (with historically accurate settings and costumes) and the West we dream of (with surreal landscapes that seem to be out of a canvas). However, Shane is more than outstanding visuals, as Stevens choice of leaving some details even more ambiguous than in the book give the film an unnatural aura that makes it feel atemporal, unique, and in a word, mythical.Alan Ladd may seem like an unlikely choice for the gunfighter named Shane, but maybe this created the desired effect of mystery the character needed. Ladd makes an excellent portrayal of this quiet, lonely man who for once attempts to socialize after living in the wild for so long. It's like a clash of worlds what happens inside him as the wild can not leave him go for long. Van Heflin, Jean Arthur and Brandon De Wilde play the Starretts, and the three have a big chemistry that make them look like a real family. Jean Arthur particularly delivers one of her best performances as Joe's troubled and beautiful wife. The cast features Jack Palance Ben Johnson and Elisha Cook Jr. in supporting roles, with the three being top-notch in unforgettable performances.It's almost impossible to try to find flaws in Shane, not because it doesn't have them (as every film has its share of goofs), but because it's beauty outshines whatever flaw it may have. However, it's safe to point out that it's pace at times becomes too slow, but soon it recovers its power as the ending approaches. It's mixture of realism with surreal landscape may be distracting at first, but it's easy to get used to it. Still, Shane heavy use of symbolism is so subtle that one can enjoy the film in many levels, from a simple gunfighter tale to a complex story about the end of an era.Personally, Shane has now become one of my favorite films, so I may be a bit biased towards it, but despite this, I can honestly say that this is a movie to be enjoyed no only by Western fans, but by fans of cinema in general. As it paved the way to great films like High Plains Drifter and Pale Rider, it's safe to say that Shane is required viewing. 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"27 September 2006","score":"","review":" Very often genre films tend to become stale, cliché-ridden, and over-imitated after a while, but this cycle also means that a film will soon break the mold and transcends its own limitations.

Everything is quick and witty and this is blended it with a very interesting and mysterious atmosphere which really works well.Often the film will make you laugh and there are simply too many one-liners and jokes within the dialogue to list.

Everything is quick and witty and this is blended it with a very interesting and mysterious atmosphere which really works well.Often the film will make you laugh and there are simply too many one-liners and jokes within the dialogue to list. This works well in juxtaposition with the air of mystery and murder also contained throughout. People may be dying rather gruesome and unpleasant deaths throughout but the fact 'they all died in their pyjamas' is a fantastic example that you shouldn't really take it too seriously. In fact, it's like the film is actually ashamed of being too graphic and too serious, but it works in its own little unique way. The music also adds to this experience as it's often rather dark and foreboding and to me, it sounded a little ahead of its time.What's also interesting is the setting. We really do see both sides of the city of Paris in this film. You have grotty hotels and dank little streets but there's also the element of romance thrown in amongst a wonderful boat ride scene. This is ultimately a hint as to the love interest forming between the two of them from one characters point of view, at least. Also; the dialogue, bizarrely enough, actually echoes when the scene is taken under a bridge via the boat ride even though it doesn't LOOK like they're on location. It was a nice touch, anyway.The story clearly plays second fiddle to the script as Grant's character takes on so many different aliases; it's close to impossible to keep up on a first viewing. The fact that all of the characters whom are 'at war' with one another within the narrative are all within a few feet of one another pretty much throughout the film is another odd thing about this film but it doesn't detract too much.A final thought is the scene where the child asks James Coburn's character 'if he's a real cowboy' or not. A rather quaint little 'nod' to 'The Magnificent Seven' from three years earlier.

It's silly, absurd, has some clever sight gags and cringeworthy puns, and while it may not contain the self-referential, breaking-the-fourth-wall humour which made Spaceballs a classic, it's still fun. Based, obviously, on Mary Shelley's original creation, and filmed in black-and-white, Young Frankenstein's plot is simple enough for a comedy of this nature. Gene Wilder plays Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (pronounced Fronkonstein), a medical lecturer, who one day, receives the will of his grandfather, Victor von Frankenstein, creator of the eponymous monster, learning he's inherited Victor's old Transylvanian castle. Upon arriving in Transylvania, leaving behind his girlfriend Elizabeth (Madeline Khan), he meets Igor (pronounced I-gor; played by Marty Feldman), and his assistant Inga (Teri Garr, playing the stereotypical blonde love interest). After discovering his grandfather's downstairs laboratory, he begins pouring over Victor's old medical notes pertaining to the Frankenstein project, and after initially trying to live down his heritage, become immersed in attempting to create another Frankenstein, despite some resistance from current tenant Frau Blaucher (Cloris Leachman). Frau's appearance ignites the film's most sustained running gag; whenever her name is uttered; horses start neighing in terror. Upon successfully digging up a large enough body, Frederick's plans go awry, when I-gor, instead of picking out the right brain, takes an abnormal brain (or in his words, the brain from Abby Normal). After eventually waking up, the mono-syllabic Frankenstein monster escapes and, while he appears threatening, he simply wants to be loved. One scene involves him walking into the house of a lonely blind man (Gene Hackman), where he invites the monster in for tea. Unfortunately, the meal goes awry, when, in attempting to light a cigar, the blind man sets Frankenstein's thumb on fire.Realising the monster's needs, and under pressure from Inspector Kemp (a German officer with one mechanical arm, which he constantly has to set into position) Frederick sets out to court public sympathy for him, which culminates in a hilarious performance of Puttin' on the Ritz between the two of them, before Frankenstein's fear of fire causes the performance to end abruptly. With Frederick and Inga's love blossoming, Elizabeth arrives in Transylvania, where she is taken by Frankenstein, and, impressed by one particular part of his body, becomes The Bride of Frankenstein. In the end, in order to save the monster from a lifetime of fear and misunderstanding, Frederick's realises he must make a personal sacrifice.While the movie takes a little while to get going, once the groundwork has been laid, it gets funnier, especially with the arrival of Marty Feldman. It parodies the films of the genre well, the most notable touch being the crackles of lightning at just the right moment. Well worth a look, especially for Brooks fans.

As such, consider the facts.In the film, the Japanese Army regulars never kill so much as a single person, implying that the worst of its conduct relied upon repossessing real estate and partially neglecting the medical and sustenance needs of westerners in captivity.The Chinese are portrayed as babbling idiots, whose ( as Spielberg implies) readily apparent hysteria ultimately separated Jamie from his family. In fact, the biggest nemesis to Christain Bale embodies that of a homeless Chinese boy who attempts to rob and beat him. Furthermore, the fact that Japanese troops apparently perpetuated little more than a repossession of real estate and confiscation of a slightly greater portion of food resources tends to imply the panicked crowds of Chinese attempting to flee the Japanese occupation as guilty of rampant paranoia and hysteria, considering that (according to Spielberg) they had little to fear from their impending occupants.Mind you, I have no qualms whatsoever of Spielberg's incentive to portray the Japanese as multidimensional humans, offset by some individuals who perpetrated reprehensible acts; that's fine. However, comparing his readily apparent sense of moral outrage as a contextual misinterpretation leads to the killing of a well-intentioned Japanese pilot by one of the main characters to the more than subtle implications of Saving PRivate Ryan that attempts to perpetuate excuses for Americans who executed unarmed German prisoners lays bear the directors affinity for insufferable hypocrisy.And, as one reviewer already pointed out, the story focuses primarily on the (not so severe, as Spielberg implies) maltreatment of white detention camp victims, rather than upon the Chinese who endured far worse at the hands of a doctrine that, like Naziism, perpetuated a sense of racial purity. Indeed, one cannot help but wonder whether Spielberg shares this imperial doctrine by envisioning the Japanese as racially superior the remaining occupants of the Pacific and Southeast Asia.Only after Munich has Spielberg begun to show even the faintest traces of either maturity or objectivity.
