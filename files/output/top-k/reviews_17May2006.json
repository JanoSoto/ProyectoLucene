[{"date":"17 May 2006","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I recorded this movie on TBS, so I know most of the inappropriate stuff was edited out. But looking past that, I have to say that the movie itself was good, but different too.The story itself is well written. An overachiever named Tracy Flick (an excellent pre-Walk- The-Line Reese Withersoon) is running unopposed in an upcoming election for school president. One of her teachers, Jim Mcallister (an equally lovable Matthew Brodrick) feels that the idea is illogical to his view of ethics and morals. This, along with his light hatred for Tracy, leads him to convince a slow witted, but good hearted football star named Paul Metzger (a well cast Chris Klein) to run against her. Things get more complicated when his lesbian sister Tammy (Jessica Cambell) joins the election to get revenge on him for stealing her mate. Meanwhile, Jim feels uneasiness when he is attracted to his ex-best friend's ex- wife, even though he's married.The acting, as an ensemble, is well done. As I sort of said above, Brodrick and Witherspoon are great in satiric and compelling roles. The rest of the actors fit their role quite well too. Director Payne's direction is a little cheesy at first, but is really quite appropriate for the story as it moves along. There is also quite a few funny jokes and moments in the movie (my favorite is the end for Matthew's reaction to seeing Tracy in New York).If the movie has any flaws, its that it leaves you with a weird feeling at the end. Its not that it's a dark story, its just that everyone gets what they want in a way that's not exactly how it should have been (anyone who saw Sideways will know what I mean). Also, it's kind of pathetic to see Brodrick's character dive deeper into to his attempt for an adulterous affair that when everything happens as it does, you get that feeling of you should have seen it coming Jim towards him.Still, I recommend it for anyone who like intelligent stories and humor.

It could be something good, something bad or simply something anecdotal.In my case, it's something anecdotal. I was watching the film live on television. That means commercials which include big sales, promotions on varied products and reality TV shows where we are supposed to watch poor fools kissing each other or accomplishing their dreams. This is called wasting our own lives watching somebody else living his\/her own.If you think that what I've just said is a little bit hard, then you're right. It's just that Fight Club strikes so hard when you see it that it automatically leaves its mark on you and never let you go. After seeing it, our visions totally change, our beliefs are seriously challenged and the name of Tyler Durden cannot be forgotten anymore.Directed by David Fincher and starring Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter, Fight Club is a masterpiece that succeeds on almost every level evaluated by the film industry. Its greatest success is undoubtedly its capacity to disturb us and provoke thoughts. A half-anarchist, half-communist propaganda work, the movie is also fairly funny and transforms strange situations into banal situations and shocking acts into suddenly full-of-sense situations.Norton plays the Narrator, an insomniac bureaucrat who works as an outside consultant for an automobile company (a major one does he assert). His real name remains unknown, even if many film buffs incorrectly refer him as Jack. In fact, it's one of the movie's many goals. The only thing that is important about him is precisely nothing. Beginning by his very identity...Back to the story, the Narrator meets Tyler Durden (Pitt). Tyler is a misfit who sells soap and lives in a house that is so rotten that it could chase the ghosts who'd like to squat it. Tyler is the messenger of the ideas carried out during the film and his philosophies turn around chaos, violence and misfortune.Together, they start the Fight Club, strictly reserved to men, whose goal is to give to its members the occasion to make roar their bestial instincts without any fear. But when the number of members begins to grow up, the Fight Club progressively changes its status until it becomes something that is really dangerous.Carter plays Marla Singer who acts as the finger between the tree and the bark. She is a misfit too, but she lives her own ordinary existence.The three main actors are quite superb. Norton is over-the-top, while Pitt is incredible and might find friends among those who hate his playboy image. Carter is convincing and adequately dreadful. Another highlight is rock singer Meat Loaf who plays a cancer patient with bitch tits.The biggest irony about Fight Club is the fact that it cost $63 million to produce when its lead wire indicates that one single cent is a cent too much. According to Tyler, man has evolved terribly wrong and his actual lifestyle might have deprived him from the most essential characteristics that make him a man. He privileges a return to the caveman status.Obviously, I don't need to mention that it's our insatiable need to consume that is attacked. You can do whatever you want with that philosophy. You can attack it, which is, for many viewers, very easy and very tempting. You can criticize it for being macho, too violent to deliver the ideas it wants to share and uselessly filled with sexual scenes.However, those three elements have all something to do with our natural instincts. Our instincts, that's what the movie wants to bring out. It's disturbing, it's shocking, but it's wanted this way.But to balance those intense moments, Fight Club also includes funny and grotesque scenes. There's something I've remarked about the Narrator and Tyler they seem to be the only ones to know that their story isn't real and that they are in a movie. It happens that they break the fourth wall and talk directly to the viewer and we can even see Tyler make appear a cigarette burn in the top right corner of the screen.Besides, many people often forget it, but the film's cinematography and special effects are exceptional. Overflowed with more-or-less obvious subliminal images, domestic rooms transforming into life-sized 3D IKEA labels and elaborate, even darkly comic explosion sequences, Fight Club becomes a feast for the eyes, as much as it is for the mind.There's no doubt that the movie is a novel adaptation (from Chuck Palahniuk, to be more precise). The constant, almost overabundant narration from Norton's character is a good indicator, as are the impressing quantity of quotes and lines that have become early classics, such as The first rule of the Fight Club is you do not talk about Fight Club. It would also be a sin to forget the titanic plot twist of the end that astounds as much, if not more than the one from Se7en, also directed by Fincher. The twist renders full of sense some previously unintelligible sentences and allows to contemplate previous situations from a different eye.Fight Club is so overheated that it becomes burning by moments (I think about the car accident episode). But nobody complains about it, if they ever notice it. Because the only thing that is essential to know is that Fight Club is a philosophical must on the same level than The Matrix and its true place is in philosophy classrooms. The problem is that few people could bear watching such hallucinating pictures.Too bad... These are superb pictures...

Any time-spanning film that takes in a handful of centuries is going to be quick with each one by necessity, or the movie would be six hours long. And I did like the space stuff, but I have a bone to pick with the idea of Merchant's Elysium device, and I'm not sure that should be capable of killing Pinhead. But even if it did, his death wouldn't kill Leviathan, or all the rest of the Cenobites who weren't there. In spite of that, the current Merchant seems convinced that he's vanquishing the enemy for all time. O_o Angelique in human form sort of annoys me &#150; I like her better once Pinhead makes her into a Cenobite. But one of the most entertaining aspects of 'Bloodline' is the rivalry between them, as well as something I'm going to call attraction\/repulsion. For most of the movie, if Pinhead and Angelique are on screen together, she starts being arrogant and coquettish, and he starts behaving as if he's out to seduce her. But underlying all of this is the mood that they might actually hate each other on some level, as they fall into a contest of wills over how to proceed with John Merchant. Over all, the actors are achieving multiple levels of mood and tone at once in each of those scenes.I also rather liked how Mr. Ramsay managed to be the same man and very different men, each time he played a new successor to the Merchant curse, neatly reinventing himself each time.And doesn't everyone love the Chatterer Beast?

Sutherland is extremely creepy in his role, which eventually turns to humor ... then back to creepy.

I know it annoyed the hell out of me when I was young, but now I kinda guessed what the story was. Also, this is the only movie that made me browse through three pages of user comments to see what other people had to say about it. I even read the Wikipedia on Jacob's Ladder.Apparently, there is a guy Jacob in the Bible that dreams of a ladder to Heaven, used by angels to move back and forth. In the end, before you are revealed the truth (**going to spoil it now!**), the dead son of Jacob's is taking him home on a ladder by holding his hand. Of course, in the end the guy is dead. He never left Vietnam, the whole thing was a vivid dream state experience induced by experimental army drugs and low brain oxygenation, he fought Death and... Death won ;)It is a worthy film, though, basically because it is good movie, with good directing and acting. Most of the actors are well known good actors, even the kid (Macaulay Culkin).

In fact I can count his directing career on one hand, but what I can't do is begin to contemplate the technical prowess that went into making this films. In Badlands, a young Martin Sheen (Kit) and Sissy Spacek (Holly) essentially roam the plains of Colorado killing people, usually to cover their tracks and to keep themselves from being caught. The story is simple enough, but it's the characters and the photography that make this movie, hands down, the most intriguing films I have ever seen. Everything is an enigma, if not a pretense for a hidden desire or message. Take for example the scene where the two characters encounter their own images of death. Young Holly decides to throw out a sickly but curable catfish into the yard rather than to watch it die in the far too small bowl in her house. She later regrets doing it after being scolded by her two male role models, her father and Kit, but what does her initial decision speak about the innocence of youth. Kit's work on a cattle ranch leads him to come across a cow dead on the ranch floor. He looks at it and puts his arms on his hips. He halfheartedly taps it with his foot. Then he sort of kicks it. He looks around suspiciously and steps on top of it and walks over to the other side. Are Kit's actions a byproduct of not being told what death is or are there other wheels turning in his head? Where is the father figure in this movie; the role to give explanation to the actions of the movie's young characters. Well, there isn't one, and this movie's youthful explosion of freedom in a world where the characters don't even know the rules makes this an intriguing character study. And finally there is the cinematography. Amongst the vast and nearly desolate plains rises the image of the mountains in the distance more than half way through the movie that serves as the maguffin of the film (any object or idea that inhibits the story's central focus). But the mountains are only an illusion created out of desperation for hope by Kit in an attempt to free himself from his past. The mountains represent hope and opportunity to him, but in actuality, they represent and would solve nothing even if he had gotten to them. Cinematography works when the camera's eye is focused on a central theme of the movie. By embedding the ideas of the movie into the viewer' brain, the images we are shown on screen are given new freedom for interpretation and personal analysis.

My parents saw it at a drive-in theatre, and all I can remember of that experience was seeing Darth Vader for the first time, and knowing that he was very, very bad). I think that speaks to its extraordinary impact. Star Wars was an event, I suppose in the way that the Beatles on Ed Sullivan for the first time was an event. It dates you, to a degree, but the reason it was important-- the reason it remains important-- is that it showed you what was possible. For much of the 1960s and 1970s, filmmakers had concentrated on showing us the brutal, heartbreaking truth of our world(The Godfather, Chinatown, Nashville-- some of the best movies ever made), and many of them succeeded brilliantly. But there's a place for dreaming dreams of things that have never been, too, and Star Wars, with its epic tale of an Empire and a rebellion in a galaxy far, far away, was the dream a generation didn't know it wanted to have until George Lucas gave it to us.Is it juvenile, at times? Simplistic, even? Sure. So's the truth, sometimes. We want to believe there's a Force, and that Luke can master its use in time to defeat the forces of darkness. So we believe it. Are the effects a bit dated now? Sure, although I still believe them. Did the success of Star Wars possibly kick off the modern blockbuster era, which gives us more and more special-effects-drenched dreck every year? Sadly, it probably did. But the thing the wannabe heirs of Star Wars usually lack is the one thing that made Star Wars such an event--courage.Back in 1977, nobody was making movies like this.

Like I said, I was only three. But having watched more movies than most people my age now, I feel comfortable saying that in its way, Star Wars is as much an independent auteur's film as anything by John Cassavetes or Woody Allen-- it has the same sort of daring, the same desire not to settle for less than showing us something we've never seen before. A bold, grand sense of old-style craftsmanship infuses everything in Star Wars, and the film delivers on the promise contained in its subtitle. At the time, it really was a new hope.

With those opening words, ''Eve's Bayou'' coils back into the past, into the memories of a child who grew up in a family both gifted and flawed, and tried to find her own way to the truth. The words explain the method of the film. This will not be a simple-minded story that breathlessly races from A to B. It is a selection of memories, filtered through the eyes of a young girl who doesn't understand everything she sees--and filtered, too, through the eyes of her older sister, and through the eyes of an aunt who can foretell everyone's future except for her own.As these images unfold, we are drawn into the same process Eve has gone through We, too, are trying to understand what happened in that summer of 1962, when Eve's handsome, dashing father--a doctor and womanizer--took one chance too many. And we want to understand what happened late one night between the father and Eve's older sister, in a moment that was over before it began.We want to know because the film makes it perfectly possible that there is more than one explanation; ''Eve's Bayou'' studies the way that dangerous emotions can build up until something happens that no one is responsible for and that can never be taken back.All of these moments unfold in a film of astonishing maturity and confidence; ''Eve's Bayou,'' one of the very best films of the year, is the debut of its writer and director, Kasi Lemmons. She sets her story in Southern Gothic country, in the bayous and old Louisiana traditions that Tennessee Williams might have been familiar with, but in tone and style she earns comparison with the family dramas of Ingmar Bergman.

Never before have I so loathed the Allied forces.If Pearl Harbor is anything to go by then the American Navy was wholly populated by loud, obnoxious morons who spent their days courting empty-headed bimbos while drinking and whooping like some thief had come along in the night, scooped out their brains and trampled them under foot. The characters here are morons. Conversely, the Japanese come across as smart, resourceful and composed. They feel no need to hoot and holler, and they don't seem to be secretly ogling male bum cakes like the American characters do. They're entirely more likable. Oh, but what about the British? Well, they enjoy fellating beefy, horse-faced Americans &#150; a British pilot tells Affleck that if the States has more men like him then their enemies should soil themselves. Like I say, the Allied forces in this film are wretched.But I do have to say that even the glorious Japanese forces have their bad moments. In a politically correct effort to 'humanise' them there's one bit where a Japanese officer melodramatically says that a truly brilliant man would find a way not to fight a war. And there's another bit where a Japanese pilot leans out of his plane and apparently warns some children of the impending carnage. It's an incredibly sappy moment. Although I'll change my opinion of said pilot if he was actually taunting the children and saying something like, I'm going to kill your daddy. Another piece of political correctness is the portrayal of Doris Miller (Cuba Gooding, Jr.). In one scene he even holds his white commanding officer while telling him how gosh darn great he his. But perhaps more insulting is the way he indulges in hooting and hollering as he shoots the Japanese down &#150; every American character in this film behaves like they're in the audience for some ghastly sitcom. I mean, it's one thing to have a fictional character act idiotically, but it's something else to belittle the efforts of a real person. And really, the character is totally superfluous. Everyone else in the film has some sort of connection to Affleck, Hartnett or Beckinsale, but Gooding exists separately. His inclusion is really just a sad concession to political correctness. His character exists only to prove to stupid right-wing Americans that there were actually black sailors who fought bravely. You know, just in case you're a Grade A moron and thought all the black sailors were hiding below decks eating fried chicken.But far more offensive than the political correctness is the 'romance'. Really, the film is about as romantic as drunken masturbation. There's just not one iota of genuine feeling in the whole movie. And of course the whole thing is completely unbelievable. Oh, some horse-face falls in love, goes to England, is presumed dead, then his girlfriend shacks up with his best friend before horse-face returns, then horse-face's ex-girlfriend finds out she's pregnant with his best friend's child on the day of his resurrection, and then the best friend dies in battle and horse-face and ex-girlfriend shack up again and bring the child up together. Yeah, that sounds plausible.But although the sequence of events is ridiculous, the scenes themselves are far worse. One of the worst is the courtship between Affleck and Beckinsale. She's a nurse, he's a pilot, and she passes him to fly because she thinks he has a cute arse and because he begs her not to take his wings. Then he turns into Inspector Clouseau and smacks his head on things and fires a champagne cork into his face. Somehow this is meant to endear us to him. The only thing I can say in response is that it's a shame it wasn't a gun equine-features accidentally shot himself with.However, I wanted to turn the gun on myself when Affleck goes to England and we have to hear Beckinsale writing her letters. Every night I look at the sunset and try and draw the last ounce of heat from its long day and send it from my heart to yours. Somewhere Fabio is nodding his head in approval. But there must be about a million sunsets in this film &#150; Bay has never met a visual cliché he didn't like.And Beckinsale writes her letters while sitting on a beach in a bikini (with a flower behind her ear) as waves crash on the rocks beyond. How old is Michael Bay exactly? It's like its been directed by a 13-year old girl. And just how white are Beckinsale's teeth? They kept on distracting me. Teeth shouldn't be that white. They shouldn't look like someone's painted gloss on them. But I also hated the way that every establishing shot was some sort of swooping crane shot. Is Bay really that short on ideas? Well&#133;yeah, of course he is.But what really makes me laugh is the way that Bay has compared this tripe to a David Lean film. Lean made romantic films that didn't make you want to wretch, romantic films that were written and directed with taste and style, romantic films that were literate and intelligent. Bay's film is none of these things. It's an infantile disasterpiece. It's a film where simpletons have teary intercourse in a parachute hanger; a film where two whooping morons almost single-handedly make the Japanese air force retreat; a film where FDR heroically rises to his feet to show what the American heart is capable of; a film where a dying man says he's cold and then symbolically hands his children over to his best pal; and a film where a bimbo with shockingly white teeth says, Now I'm going to give Danny my whole heart&#133;but I don't think I'll ever look at another sunset without thinking of you.

Ian and Elieen were in a off Broadway play (along with Ian McShane) in 1969. It ran 3 months. So its safe to say, Ian and Eileen are good friends from way back. I liked this film very much. I did wish Judi,Ian and Elieen had bigger parts. All three are cast well in their roles. Ian is a hoot. he is usually cast in more serious roles. A light fluffy bit of fun.The entire cast is good. The actor in the lead is quite good.The girl is good as well. Not a bad film at all.A nice way to spend 2 hours. Go check it out.

This movie has many great quotes and very cute actors. My personal favorite character is Micheal or tum tum, his ninja name given to him by his grandfather. among my favorite lines are, scramble and Hey, who ate all my good an' plenty?.

It is a classic showing of what man struggles with and how he overcomes. It is also a beautiful way to end the run of an incredible group of characters.This story mirrors modern events taking place in the 90's which some have come to criticize. However, I think it is a great tool for showing us ourselves, plus this movie is done so well it could stand with out history present.We find the Klingon empire on the verge of extinction do to a their own militaristic government. The Federation is faced with an interesting situation, do we come to the aid of our greatest enemy or do we bring them to their knees? It is decided an olive branch will be extended by the hand of Kirk. Kirk is unhappy with this not just because of his history of battle with the Klingons but also because of the wound created not long ago by the murder of his son at the hands of a Klingon.The struggles of the older crew in the world that is being created is genuine and honest. The crew of the Enterprise show that human struggle comes at all times and is fought the hardest in ourselves with our own ideals.Great acting by all the cast and a fantastic direction create a real story. Incredible FX make for an exciting experience. All in all a great movie with an incredible story for anyone.

But it was enjoyable for other reasons, too. I never even noticed that Pete Atkins snuck in there as the bartender who becomes Barbie the Cenobite! And of course the back-story on Elliott was a treat.Everyone really did a fantastic job in this one, too, with playing their characters to the hilt. Even the little ditzy blonde that J.P. lures to bed only to end up a McCenobite snack. Yeah, she was a talking stereotype, but she was 100% into it. She is also a study in how clueless women often act, sad to say. They believe what they want to, ignoring the facts of life and getting hurt &#150; or in this case munched down without sauce. Another little bit of psychology tossed in, and I love it every time they do it. In that scene, there is a quote that I rarely hear cited in any 'favorite quotes' thread, but it's a great one Their wealth was so tempting, their affection so conditional, what could you do? Dr. Pinhead is in. Face it, he'd make a great therapist, even if the couch might have nails sticking out of it. Of course my personal favorite quote is also in this scene Flesh. Power. Dominion. But I'm not going to explain why. =) It was great to read that Doug had gotten to play with the make-up for the second crew's director, applying the wound effects on the guy that Camerahead stabs his lens through. Doug tells us in his book that he was just standing around on set when the crew turned out to be short-handed and he stepped up to help. Now whenever I watch that scene I think, There's Doug's handiwork! The main thing that bugged me about this film was Joey falling for Pinhead's trick of showing up as her father. Not a problem with the movie, it's just one of those 'scream at the screen' moments. How can she be so stupid? But hey, that's our clueless women believing what they want to phenomenon kicking in again! (Not to pick on women - men do it, too). ;) And I know he doesn't believe it, but the bit where Doug says the word 'unstoppable'? It's not messed up.
