Even if they haven't seen the film many people will still be aware of scenes such as the fantastic opening (with Indy navigating through a trap-filled cave and narrowly escaping from a giant boulder), so I think it says a lot about a film when it has so many moments that have gone on to become so famous. Apart from the possible expectations of Star Wars and The Godfather, I can't think of any other films that achieve this memorability so well. My personal favourite moments from the film, as well as the opening scene which I have already mentioned, have got to include the hilarious moment when a swordsman challenges Indy, showing off his sword skills only for our hero to casually shoot him and continue on his way. Another fantastic moment is the plane fight, where Indiana is fighting a large henchman resulting in the man getting quite brutally killed in the propeller of an aeroplane. Not to mention the glorious melting faces of the villains at the end of the film when the ark is opened.. Despite my positively glowing account of the film so far, it's not without its faults. The film is so well known by now that it has admittedly lost a lot of the original sparkle (which is similarly true for the Star Wars trilogy) and also some of the special effects and matte backgrounds don't always convince...but these things are expected as they are due to age.

Because it mixes live-action and cartoons, it was a challenge to be made. But that's exactly what makes it so distinguish and unique, especially considering that the idea works out so well. It's a different and original movie experience, a real winner.Yet, the film is more than a combination of live-action and cartoons. It has a dark atmosphere with lots of suspense, almost like a thriller. Classic humor isn't forgotten either, with numerous funny lines and hysterical gags, as well as humorous characters. The joke about «uncle Thumper» is one of the funniest, but there are many others. There's also a hilarious piano acting with Donald Duck and Daffy Duck, which they play the same piano song as in Tom & Jerry's short The Cat Concerto and have their hilariously silly battle. In fact, the soundtrack of the movie is excellent, including Jessica Rabbit's song Why don't you do right? and a suspense music very similar to one from the original Back to the Future.Other movies that successfully mix live-action and cartoons are Mary Poppins, Pete's Dragon and Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Like Who Framed Roger Rabbit, those three movies combine this marriage very well. On the other hand, other movies such as Space Jam tried this idea but without the same success.I believe that this movie was made in a unique moment of inspiration. The sceneries are great, the designs, the cartoons, the backgrounds, the details, the animation, the special effects, the artwork... everything was carefully made and I much welcome that. This is one of the greatest Disney films.Great actors make the difference too. Bob Hoskins is English but speaks with an excellent American accent, not to mention that he does the amazing thing of acting against the air. Joanna Cassidy, Charles Fleischer, Alan Tilvern, Stubby Kaye, Cristopher Lloyd and Kathleen Turner are awesome too. Kathleen Turner is the voice of Jessica Rabbit, with that sexy and sensual voice. And... guess what! Even the singer Frank Sinatra has a minor role in this film as the hilarious but useless Singing Sword. Even without looking at the credits, who wouldn't recognize that great voice? Frank Sinatra's voice is just as recognizable as Nat King Cole's or Sterling Holloway's.As for the characters, the weasels are a perfect example of chronical stupidity. They're humorous because they're always laughing, even though they know what happens to someone who can't stop laughing.Marvin Acme is «the king of the jokes», always humorous and cheerful and at his funniest with his mythical hand-buzzer. Angelo is an idiot, drunk and greedy guy, but funny at the same time. Dolores is a great character. R. K. Maroon is an interesting character with half a dark side and half a good side. Judge Doom is a great villain, humorous, mysterious and somewhat sinister. Roger Rabbit is hilarious and very jolly - that's his only purpose as a cartoon, like he says himself. Jessica Rabbit is a very sexy cartoon, one of the most beautiful and sexiest ever - she's not bad, she's just drawn that way. Benny the Cab is funny. Baby Herman is a bit annoying - he might look innocent at first, but he is extremely rude and he loves to woo women. Eddie Valiant is another great character - grumpy, serious and funny sometimes. And he looks very much like my godfather in appearance.The movie takes place in Hollywood, 1947. It does recreate the 40's very well. That influence is notorious in many ways, including the cars used.Before finishing, let me say that I like rabbits very much.

In addition to that, two years after the series began, young fans finally got to see the superheroes on the big screen, in 1995's Mighty Morphin Power Rangers The Movie, which didn't seem to disappoint most of those fans.The evil and despised Ivan Ooze is finally released from captivity after six thousand years, so the Power Rangers have a new enemy! The superheroes soon find that their power is gone, and when they go to the command centre, they discover that Ivan has destroyed the place, and Zordon is dying! In order to defeat Ivan and rescue Zordon before it's too late, the Rangers must travel to a distant planet, the only place where they can retrieve their powers! Meanwhile, Ivan begins his attack on the city of Angel Grove! Being in the right age group at the time, I remember the heyday of the original Power Rangers series very well. I was a big fan for a while, but never saw this movie. Basically out of curiosity, I finally just watched it, years after losing all interest in the entire Power Rangers franchise. Early in the film, I found that it was so bad that it was sort of funny, with its cheesy lines and action sequences, so it looked like it would be mildly enjoyable, as an unintentional comedy. Unfortunately, it doesn't stay this way for long, it soon changes, and for the rest of the movie (which is most of it), it's both cheesy AND boring, that is, for those who have left their childhood behind. The Power Rangers franchise was made strictly for kids, and this full-length feature is no exception. I might even give this movie a lower rating than 3\/10 if it wasn't for the fact that I probably would have LOVED it if I saw it when it was first released, and probably even three years later!Although it appears they're still making new Power Rangers shows of different names, the days of the original are now long over, and those who were kids in the 1990s and were fans are now much older. Some TV shows and movies that one enjoys while in their childhood could easily still be enjoyable for them when they grow up, but clearly, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers The Movie is not one of those. With the ridiculous name of the main villain (Ivan Ooze) and the ooze that comes out of him, as well as the childish lines (such as Go get 'em, booger man!), the poor quality characters, and so many other things (most of which you would probably find in the show as well), I'm sure it's VERY hard for an adult to take this movie seriously. So, for adults, I don't recommend Mighty Morphin Power Rangers The Movie, even if you're looking for a movie that's so bad it's unintentionally funny.

I was a big fan for a while, but never saw this movie. Basically out of curiosity, I finally just watched it, years after losing all interest in the entire Power Rangers franchise. Early in the film, I found that it was so bad that it was sort of funny, with its cheesy lines and action sequences, so it looked like it would be mildly enjoyable, as an unintentional comedy. Unfortunately, it doesn't stay this way for long, it soon changes, and for the rest of the movie (which is most of it), it's both cheesy AND boring, that is, for those who have left their childhood behind. The Power Rangers franchise was made strictly for kids, and this full-length feature is no exception. I might even give this movie a lower rating than 3\/10 if it wasn't for the fact that I probably would have LOVED it if I saw it when it was first released, and probably even three years later!Although it appears they're still making new Power Rangers shows of different names, the days of the original are now long over, and those who were kids in the 1990s and were fans are now much older. Some TV shows and movies that one enjoys while in their childhood could easily still be enjoyable for them when they grow up, but clearly, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers The Movie is not one of those. With the ridiculous name of the main villain (Ivan Ooze) and the ooze that comes out of him, as well as the childish lines (such as Go get 'em, booger man!), the poor quality characters, and so many other things (most of which you would probably find in the show as well), I'm sure it's VERY hard for an adult to take this movie seriously. So, for adults, I don't recommend Mighty Morphin Power Rangers The Movie, even if you're looking for a movie that's so bad it's unintentionally funny. However, looking at how many kids this movie has impressed, I guess it deserves SOME credit.

So after Fire Down Below and The Patriot, I was starting to worry. Not the most intense efforts on his part. Both FDB and the Patriot were too slow-moving for their own good. Although when FDB was reaching its end, I still cared. The same thing cannot be said about the the Patriot. By the time it ended, I was glad it was over. Something had happened with Seagal's movies--there was less action, more Seagal looking at someone with a mean look on his face. And, unless I was seeing things, more stunt double work than Seagal doing his own moves, which, as a fan, I didn't appreciate. Exit Wounds is a good return. From start to finish, very little to complain about. Very little, I said, but not nothing. 2 complaints. One is him and DMX. They actually don't partner up until the end of the movie, but the scenes where they fight each other are quite enthralling. When they finally do hook up, it's cool. The second problem is in one scene when Seagal boosts a motorcycle to outrun someone. Except for the closeup shots of Seagal on the bike, in every shot you could see the stunt double. And he wasn't a good one. Like I said, 2 complaints. Otherwise, excellent Seagal fare. Blazing action, easy to follow story, great supporting cast. The cinematography is blazing, with Seagal producing some of his best fight sequences to date. I was very pleased. Leaving the theater, I knew there wouldn't be a sequel, but I had new hope that there would be a reemergence of fresh, new Seagal works. Sadly, that hope was quickly burned out, but, hey, enjoy it while you can.

Hitchcock suffered influences, obviously, but what he allowed to happen after him place him among the most memorable inventors in the history of cinema.

The music should have been instrumental, as it would've given this film a more subtle feel. Still, this is such a minor flaw to what is ultimately a very powerful experience.

That is the set up.On the way to Florida on a train, Curtis woman character falls in love with a woman singer in the band played by Marilyn Monroe. This film is one of her better efforts & no doubt the best turn at comedy she tried. Curtis then sets up Marilyn on a date with his alter ego, Curtis doing an impressive imitation of Cary Grant. Meanwhile, Lemmon has a problem as Joe E Brown, an exotic millionaire, has fallen for her (him). The films closing is a riot involving this plot line. That set up for this film seems quite simple, but when you watch it you realize how difficult it was to set up & how talented the cast is. I think it can still be enjoyed by viewers, even now. This film is not the first to involve men dressing as women for comic effects. Charlie Chaplin did it in a short before 1920. It is the best film to use it to comic effect though honorable mention should be made to Tootsie & Mrs. Doubtfire in this category.This one is better because the script works so well than nothing about it seems absurd or abnormal.

Jarmusch's direction is very minimalist, but it suits the material perfectly. No other filmmaker outside of possibly Monte Hellman can do minimalist film-making consistently so well. Admittedly, this kind of drama-comedy isn't for all tastes, but if you're interested in Jarmusch, this may be a good starting place.In addition to the hilarious dry comedy, the film is very unassuming and enjoyable because of that. All of the characters are great and often very likable. Its leisurely paced (as with all of Jarmusch's films), but entertaining despite of that. Sure, after the film is done it feels a bit pointless (there really isn't any running themes between the stories outside of the hotel). However, its easy to see why this has become a cult classic. It holds up very well on repeat viewings. I guess like all cult films, its an either you love it or hate it kind of thing. Personally, I love this little film.

For a musical to be enjoyable, the music should be an embellishment of a story that is otherwise fun to watch. Dancing is the same thing.

The only people on the IMDb who fail to worship On the Waterfront appear to be those who hate its director - on 'ethical' grounds. Well, I care little enough about Elia Kazan's history or politics, yet all the same somehow I wasn't sufficiently impressed. The film features all the technical skill of Hollywood's Golden Age, supporting actors and establishing shots and, yes, innovative use of music; in many ways I'd rate it 8 out of 10. But the best film ever - the greatest star performance? That I honestly can't see, and I admit that the high expectations hurt my reaction to the result. But thinking back, I find the chief causes of my vague dissatisfaction to be twofold Marlon Brando, and the too-convenient outcomes of the plot.Brando I suppose I just don't 'get' - I saw him in A Streetcar Named Desire and One-Eyed Jacks, and missed whatever-it-was I was supposed to spot then. Where I'm concerned he holds if anything a sort of physical anti-charisma - the slouch, the mumble - and the acting that supposedly makes his contemporaries look like posturing hams, I simply don't see. And so in my ignorance, not knowing that this was held to be one of the greatest performances of the century, I was left with the impression that Marlon Brando was actually the weak link in this film.The revelation that the character is thirty years of age comes as a real shock he's treated and acts throughout as little more than a sulky teenager. The lack of expression may simply be skillful acting to depict the character's stunted emotional growth, but I'm afraid I found it hard to care much what happened to Brando's Terry Malloy, whereas Rod Steiger, with far briefer screen-time, brought brother Charley and his wrenching choice vividly to life. But there's nothing inherently wrong with the role of Terry, and I can't help feeling that it would have been fascinating to see what some other actor might also have made of it.My other serious problem, unfortunately, was the way that the plot treats our heroes with kid gloves... thus undermining the whole sense of menace on which any one man against the Mob plot ultimately relies. Yes, the script is happy enough to bump off a minor character or two in order to emphasise the threat of Friendly's organisation, and yes, Terry does finally get beaten up. But compared to the summary justice administered to Joey Doyle or Dugan for far lighter offences, a punch-up seems pretty easy going - Terry's lucky not to fall victim to another 'accident'.But the fact remains that up until then, our heroes have got away with open defiance. As far as the Production Code goes, Edie is evidently sacrosanct by virtue of her sex and the priest by virtue of his cloth (despite Dugan's portentous warnings, the worst the Father gets seems to be a rotten tomato). Brando is, one can only assume, preserved by being The Hero.A highly dramatic assassination attempt amounts to no more than driving a lorry at him in the street, with no attempt to finish the job as he takes the bait and hangs around Charley's body to emote. He walks into his enemies' headquarters with no more protection than a single unaccustomed gun, and no-one even attempts to lay a finger on him... even after his own ally, equally unscathed, knocks him down! The worst repercussion he seems to face, for all the trumpeted bravery of his betrayal, is a petulant you'll never work in this town again - and even this is undermined by a convenient unheralded change of heart on the part of the workers who have never previously cared for him the 'bum' who gets all the cushy jobs and now the traitor who broke the code of the docks, yet losing a fight suddenly makes him some kind of holy hero. I'm left with that feeling of manipulation things happening or failing to happen because they meet the desired message, not because they further the emotional value of the plot.Some aspects of the script are very well done, but I found myself with the jarring conviction that I'd just watched a film noir - and a good one, with all the skills and devices of the genre - with a tacked-on happy ending. In a great film, the plot should seem ordained, interlocking, inevitable. Here, I got the impression that the screenplay was more interested in showcasing big scenes for its star, and in an arbitrary moral, however obtained - maybe politics does come into it after all...In many ways, the film is good; it's worth having seen. But I cannot truthfully say that I would recommend it whole-heartedly to a friend, let alone recommend him to put himself to trouble or expense to see it, as I did. That makes for a rating of 6\/10. Without Brando, for my part, it would probably have been a seven.(Edit I was fascinated to discover by chance today that the uneasy strain between the basic story set-up and the final outcome is *not* in my imagination alone it's the direct result of warring visions between writer and director.

The worst repercussion he seems to face, for all the trumpeted bravery of his betrayal, is a petulant you'll never work in this town again - and even this is undermined by a convenient unheralded change of heart on the part of the workers who have never previously cared for him the 'bum' who gets all the cushy jobs and now the traitor who broke the code of the docks, yet losing a fight suddenly makes him some kind of holy hero. I'm left with that feeling of manipulation things happening or failing to happen because they meet the desired message, not because they further the emotional value of the plot.Some aspects of the script are very well done, but I found myself with the jarring conviction that I'd just watched a film noir - and a good one, with all the skills and devices of the genre - with a tacked-on happy ending. In a great film, the plot should seem ordained, interlocking, inevitable. Here, I got the impression that the screenplay was more interested in showcasing big scenes for its star, and in an arbitrary moral, however obtained - maybe politics does come into it after all...In many ways, the film is good; it's worth having seen. But I cannot truthfully say that I would recommend it whole-heartedly to a friend, let alone recommend him to put himself to trouble or expense to see it, as I did. That makes for a rating of 6\/10. Without Brando, for my part, it would probably have been a seven.(Edit I was fascinated to discover by chance today that the uneasy strain between the basic story set-up and the final outcome is *not* in my imagination alone it's the direct result of warring visions between writer and director. The character of Terry really has been 'sexed up' to provide Brando with a more significant and sympathetic role, and the apotheosis of the informer is all Kazan's idea - in Schulberg's published version, Terry winds up in an unmarked grave and Father Barry is the most important protagonist... It turns out that the dislocation that jarred me so can be traced with almost clinical exactness to this collision of two quite separate concepts of message and plot frankly, it explains an awful lot!)

I guess it is Disney that has made Peter Pan's character well known throughout these decades but only seemingly. I think it's not fair that they take so much credit, when they have never ever told the original story or introduced the original characters as they were meant to be or even got close.First The characters. This movie makes Peter an elf in Robin Hood costume instead of a human boy in probably-not-Robin-Hood-costume and ignores all the persona characteristics in him that really matter. This movie makes Wendy a babbling idiot. And poor Captain Hook a TOTAL clown. The supposed-to-be-scary crocodile is a drooling puppy dog in this film. And of course as every Disney cartoon must have a character which has had too many hits in the head, they made one of the Lost Boys that one. The only character that has not been completely disgraced in this film is Tink. Even for an independent film that is a bad thing; none of the characters having any originality or depth in them.The story itself then? The Darling parents don't even get the time to notice their kids are gone!!! Probably one of the most significant point in the original story and they ruined it! Also the famous nursery scene between Peter Pan and Wendy is a stunning piece of- There are no thimbles and no acorns - one of the little things that makes the original story such a unique one. It's a wonder he even had lost his shadow and she helped him stick it. (Even though to his shoes and it makes no sense to me.)And the ending is happy through and through. The story made NO difference to any of the characters what-so-ever. Their adventure was POINTLESS even if they were making memories. For the viewer there was no memorable scenes either. I kept forgetting almost everything about this film over and over again, even though I saw this countless of times when I was a kid, like 5 years old or so. I tried to watch this a few time when I was a teen, but again - forgettable! Clever bastards! Making it so forgettable that people end up watching it over again and again. I won't ever again, as now I've written down what I thought of it.Ruining a great story like this, just to amuse children should be illegal. So know now if you haven't known it before - this Disney version does not have anything significant in common with the original story - which is not really a children's story but just a great, great story.And as said, this film is very forgettable all in all. It can be enjoyable for very small children but almost insulting their intelligence by not being... well, more intelligent! And more colorful and more original. This just annoys me to no end.

When originally released, it seemed to have disappointed a lot of his fans expecting another Pulp Fiction. Jackie Brown is a much more subtle and low-key crime film, almost similar to what was produced in the 70s. It lacks the flashiness and impact that his previous two films had, but overall its a more mature film with emphasis placed on character development. It also seems pretty much free of Tarantino's trademark pop culture references, and is much more leisurely paced (which will turn some people off, but doesn't really matter to me).The film works so well because, in addition to the superb screenplay and direction, the acting is truly accomplished. Pam Grier, best known for various 70s blaxploitation cult classics, turns in a revelatory performance, easily her best to date. Equally surprising is Robert Forster, playing one of cinema's most sympathetic characters, a middle aged man who seems to not know what to do with his life. The supporting performances are great as well. As usual with Tarantino, there's no clear cut good guys and bad guys. All the characters have a layer of depth rarely seen in modern crime thrillers.So why isn't this considered a classic? Well, while the more low key style was a step forward for Tarantino as a filmmaker, it also lacked the impact that Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction had. It lacks the bite that those films had, and while Jackie Brown has better characters, his earlier films just seemed more energetic. My advice - forget this is a Tarantino film. You'll enjoy it more.

Sniffing paydirt, he hires himself out to both factions as a gunman. Can he stay one step ahead of the hoods ?This is a stylish, hard-nosed gangster reworking of Sergio Leone's 1964 Per Un Pugno Di Dollari \/ A Fistful Of Dollars, which was a western remake of Akira Kurosawa's 1961 ronin classic Yojimbo (and all three stories bear a lot of similarity to Carlo Goldoni's 1753 comic play Il Servitore Di Due Padroni \/ The Servant Of Two Masters). It cites the Japanese film as its main source, but is essentially a remake of both; storywise it follows the samurai movie (for example, Walken's character is identical to Tatsuya Nakadai's), but visually it's much closer to Leone's (lots of guns). It's own hard-boiled style, with raspy narration and a town full of grifters, also comes from noir fiction (say, Dashiel Hammett's 1929 pot-boiler Red Harvest). In this sense, it's more of a series of cultural references and motifs than a movie, but it's still a lot of fun, remaining faithful to the classic tale of the mysterious pragmatic avenger, and the hybrid gangster\/western setting is very original. Willis lacks the mythic qualities of Mifune and Eastwood, but is pretty good in the lead, with able support from Sanderson and Dern. The two best performances are by Hill regular Kelly as the head of the Irish clan (there's a beautifully tender moment where he expresses his unassailable love for Lombard whilst his goons look embarrassed) and the ever-reliable Walken as a nutty red-headed whispering psycho. This story will always be appealing because it slyly blurs the divide between hero and antihero - he helps and exploits people in equal measures. Slickly written by Hill in his usual tough-guy patois, with a strangled score by Ry Cooder, top-notch stuntwork by Allan Graf and great dusty sepia-soaked photography by Lloyd Ahern - surely this is the brownest film ever made. Well worth catching, but don't miss its two predecessors, particularly Yojimbo (the hardest to find), which is one of the most engrossing, stylishly-made and funniest mythic adventure movies of all time.
