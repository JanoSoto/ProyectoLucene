But in this time of compressed stories with meaningless one liners and fast paced action and cutting he stands out as a testament to a higher potential for filmic story telling.

Even so, it's an impressive effort for a first-time director and a well made, engaging film that succeeds solely on the strengths of its narrative material and structure. Also to its credit are fine performances from Laura Linney and Mark Ruffalo. The entire setting for the story is a small town where Linney lives as a single mother, still inhabiting the house where she and her brother (Ruffalo) grew up. Early on, we understand her brother to be the rebellious wanderer type, having apparently spent most of his adult life in the big city. And just like all bad pennies, the time has come for him to return to his roots. Predictably, some cages are rattled after he shows up, most notably Linney's, as she copes with unsatisfying attempts at dating and angst over her son's total alienation from his bad father. Matthew Broderick does a nice turn as Linney's married, but sex-starved boss, with whom she has some very impulsive encounters. The whole thing moves along nicely, and Linney is always a pleasure to watch. In this and virtually every role I've seen her perform, she proves herself to be a very talented, natural and unpretentious actor. Opposite Linney, Ruffalo is also very believable as the problem child. He seems to embody the type of trouble-making misfit most of us have known or encountered at some time in our lives.  So, with all these positive observations, why should I find anything lacking? To be honest, I can't quite put my finger on it. Maybe the best way to sum it up would be a comment made by the person I was with when I saw the film. It was like a really good TV movie, she said. And I immediately agreed with her. One thing's for certain It's refreshing to see a film that's enjoyable on a number of levels without the need for special effects, exotic locations and the excesses of vulgarity that Hollywood so frequently uses.

They called it catharsis, best translated by 'cleaning the souls'. Well, measured by the tremendous effect on all of us writing reviews on the film, STAND BY ME has the power and qualities of ancient tragedy. This jewel of a film touches and shakes the best sides in us. I have watched it over and over again, and even if I watch it several times a week I still sit and laugh and cry, and it leaves me sad and confused and grateful, feelings that can last for hours and sometimes days.So what is the mystery behind this masterpiece?First of all it teaches us that good filmmaking isn't about the dollars spent on the production, but about the people who make it.And it's about a unique and humble (I hope you understand what I mean) director Rob Reiner doesn't try to show how good he is, leering at the Oscar-jurythe story is told without any visual effects, the pace is slow and the cinematography is unspectacular, but he succeeds in inspiring his young actors to perform honest feelings and letting the story develop by its own terms. An example is the milkmoney-scene. It is told that Reiner wasn't satisfied with the performance of River Phoenix. They tried again and again. Finally, he told River to remember a situation of his own life where a grownup had let him down. Guess if he succeeded with it! River Phoenix started crying and he couldn't stop crying a long time after the shot was taken. That's why this film is pure gold it doesn't show professional acting, it shows young boys who open their hearts in front of a camera. They can do it, because they can relate to similar experiences and because the message is important and universal. We all can relate to similar situations. These scenes make me remember events from my own youth that I had inhibited for a long time, because I didn't like to remember them. That's the pain!But it's not only the director and the actors who should earn all the credits. I read the novel after watching the film, and since that time Stephen King is one of the great contemporary writers in my book. I just don't understand why he doesn't write more of THE BODY kind. To me this book is pure poetry (including all those four-letter-words that Maltin e. a. don't like, because they don't understand why they are necessary)! But the most amazing thing is the script doesn't only catch the quintessence of the novel, it's partly even better! This perfect balance between humor and seriousness! It doesn't manipulate the audience. In the book grownup Gordon sits in his car when he had read about his friend's death. I drove out of town, parked, and cried for him. Cried for damn near half an hour, I guess. In the film Gordon doesn't cry. He doesn't need to. Everyone in the audience feels like crying, because they understand the tragedy! There are only 13 pages of dialogue and narration, and there really is not one line too much. It's so good, I almost know the whole of it by heart. Take the ending In the book, the famous writer Gordon Lachance tells about how he met Ace Merrill again, some twenty years after the Ray Brower event grown fat and the only one alive of his old friends and enemies. How much better is the film's ending! This important line about the friends we had when we were twelve years old is only a line in King's book, commending the good time the boys have at Milo Pressman's junkyard! If there had been an Oscar for impressive film endings, this film had deserved the first!And thank you Jack Nitzsche for the intense score. It's Gordie's theme, when he's not with his friends. In the group Gordie is the smart boy with the sharp, quick, fresh replies. Without the friends, at home or in the store he barely speaks a word. And then we can hear that fragile Jack Nitzsche variation on Stand by me. It's like Gordie crying `where are you, Chris? Come, stand by me'. That's brilliant and exactly what great filmmusic should be serving the film's dramaturgy.Well, I don't know how many hours it took me to express my love to this film in a language that isn't my own. It seems impossible. It is exactly as Stephen King expressed it himself (end of chapter 29) `Even if I'd known the right thing to say, I probably couldn't have said it. Speech destroys the functions of love, I think - that's a hell of a thing for a writer to say, I guess, but I believe it to be true. If you speak to tell a deer you mean it no harm, it glides away with a single flip of its tail. The word is the harm. Love isn't what these asshole poets like McKuen want you to think it is. Love has teeth; they bite; the wounds never close. No word, no combination of words, can close those lovebites. It's the other way around, that's the joke. If those wounds dry up, the words die with them. Take it from me. I've made my life from the words, and I know that is so.'10 out of 10, no doubt about it!

They can do it, because they can relate to similar experiences and because the message is important and universal. We all can relate to similar situations. These scenes make me remember events from my own youth that I had inhibited for a long time, because I didn't like to remember them. That's the pain!But it's not only the director and the actors who should earn all the credits. I read the novel after watching the film, and since that time Stephen King is one of the great contemporary writers in my book. I just don't understand why he doesn't write more of THE BODY kind. To me this book is pure poetry (including all those four-letter-words that Maltin e. a. don't like, because they don't understand why they are necessary)! But the most amazing thing is the script doesn't only catch the quintessence of the novel, it's partly even better! This perfect balance between humor and seriousness! It doesn't manipulate the audience. In the book grownup Gordon sits in his car when he had read about his friend's death. I drove out of town, parked, and cried for him. Cried for damn near half an hour, I guess. In the film Gordon doesn't cry. He doesn't need to. Everyone in the audience feels like crying, because they understand the tragedy! There are only 13 pages of dialogue and narration, and there really is not one line too much. It's so good, I almost know the whole of it by heart. Take the ending In the book, the famous writer Gordon Lachance tells about how he met Ace Merrill again, some twenty years after the Ray Brower event grown fat and the only one alive of his old friends and enemies. How much better is the film's ending! This important line about the friends we had when we were twelve years old is only a line in King's book, commending the good time the boys have at Milo Pressman's junkyard! If there had been an Oscar for impressive film endings, this film had deserved the first!And thank you Jack Nitzsche for the intense score. It's Gordie's theme, when he's not with his friends. In the group Gordie is the smart boy with the sharp, quick, fresh replies. Without the friends, at home or in the store he barely speaks a word. And then we can hear that fragile Jack Nitzsche variation on Stand by me. It's like Gordie crying `where are you, Chris? Come, stand by me'. That's brilliant and exactly what great filmmusic should be serving the film's dramaturgy.Well, I don't know how many hours it took me to express my love to this film in a language that isn't my own. It seems impossible. It is exactly as Stephen King expressed it himself (end of chapter 29) `Even if I'd known the right thing to say, I probably couldn't have said it. Speech destroys the functions of love, I think - that's a hell of a thing for a writer to say, I guess, but I believe it to be true. If you speak to tell a deer you mean it no harm, it glides away with a single flip of its tail. The word is the harm. Love isn't what these asshole poets like McKuen want you to think it is. Love has teeth; they bite; the wounds never close. No word, no combination of words, can close those lovebites. It's the other way around, that's the joke. If those wounds dry up, the words die with them. Take it from me. I've made my life from the words, and I know that is so.'10 out of 10, no doubt about it!

So I joyfully waited for Gothic atmosphere and cool monsters. When it had ended, something like Well, I think I didn't understand this. drifted slowly through my mind. Only one or to days later it dawned on me that I had expected the wrong thing. This is not a horror movie but a movie that tries to make you think. It is about a riddle and it is a riddle itself, full of clues and meanings. Viewed this way, it makes a lot of sense. I found myself thinking about it again and again.To me the main question while I watched was Who is the girl?SPOILER WARNING *** SPOILERS IN NEXT PARAGRAPHLike it is written in some of the other comments (without spoiler warning though), I think that the girl who appears again and again but refuses to tell her name is Lucifer. With that idea everything seems to fall into place. I don't know much about these things but a quick lock into my etymological dictionary told me that Lucifer means light bringer and is also a name for the planet Venus and that Lucifer is said to be a fallen angel. It is very clear that the girl must be some kind of angel, at least the hero's guardian angel. The only supernatural things which are shown in the film (and with fine, quiet understatement) are done by her and also she seems to be the only one who knows what it is all about. But this is not simply the answer to the riddle but leads to other interesting questions, the most important being Is Lucifer in truth a good person?

This is definitely not a plot movie, but a film dedicated to its characters. What more could I want? The safe heist is almost an afterthought when compared to the great performances we get from Rourke, Roberts, Burt Young, and Geraldine Page! Page's tubercular monologue is a complete highlight. Vincent Patrick's novel is truly brought to life without neglecting any of his rich, N.Y.C. dialogue or the detailed idiosyncracies of small-time hoodlum behavior. Alright, maybe Darryl Hannah is gratuitous casting, but Roberts! Regarding the film's two leads, Roberts in this film is taking so many risks, pushing so many different buttons, you've got to admire the guy for going that far out. I can almost disregard the 2,000 straight to video erotic thrillers and action films the guy's been doing since 1987 just based on this performance. Plus, that perm he's got is poetry. Rourke becomes a little repetetive in his household destruction mannerisms, but still gives a thoughtful and taut performance as well. The two of them together, I think, have a chemistry that actually rivals that of DeNiro and Keitel in Mean Streets.My only complaint with this movie is who the f*** decided to let Dave Gruisin do the score? Wasn't Tootsie warning enough that this guy's music sounds about as appetizing as a platter of burnt corn? Would you honestly want the guy who composed Tootsie's Theme to score a gritty, street movie about criminals? I would have rather have heard John Tesh ballads during some of this movie than Gruisin's tinkly, feel-good, yuppie, pre-Kenny G. bum poop that tries to pass for jazz. Now Herbie Hancock, there's the man to do this movie justice. Nonetheless, other than this minor complaint, I couldn't recommend the movie more for its humor and attention to character.
