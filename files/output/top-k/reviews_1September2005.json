I know several people who don't agree with me, but in my opinion, his performance makes even the worst movie worth a try. Not that it always saves them, but it sure helped me to sit through some of them. However, in this case that isn't even necessary. Ever since I saw Birdy for the first time, I am a fan of its story.When Al Columbato meets Birdy for the first time, he thinks he's a bit of a weirdo. Birdy isn't all that interested in social contacts with other children or young adolescents. All he wants is to play with his pigeons. But after a while Al and Birdy become good friends who have a lot of fun together, especially when they go after some new pigeons for Birdy or when try to fly themselves,... But then the Vietnam war starts and it doesn't take long before both men are sent to this far Asian country. When they return they both have changed. Especially Birdy is in an awful state. Suffering from severe shell-shock, he is in a hospital for mental patients, where he sits in his room without speaking a word while acting like a bird. When Al is asked to help with his therapy by trying to talk to him, he does his best, but even he doesn't seem capable to penetrate into Birdy's isolated world...I know that I've once said that Hollywood doesn't seem to be able to make original drama's which are a lot better than the average TV-movie, but I admit that that was an exaggeration. Birdy is a very good and really original movie which can stand a test with movies like for instance the English drama Spider. Not only is the story very good, so is the directing and the acting. Even though I've heard of him before, I can't say that I've ever seen another movie of Alan Parker, but this Birdy sure proves that the man must be a good director. Also very interesting in this movie were the very young Nicolas Cage, John Harkins - who has more often played in TV-movies and series than in other movies, but who did a good job in this one - and Matthew Modine who hasn't played any big role in an important movie since the late 1980's.The only problem many people might have with this movie is the fact that it is said to be a war movie, but doesn't really show much of the action typical for such movies. It's a part of the story of course, but it isn't as important as some people might want. Also the fact that it is a - for Hollywood at least - quite unusual drama, might cost it quite some viewers. Personally I didn't have any problem with that, I'm already used to watch the 'not-so-average' movie and I must say that this one still stands after all those years. That's why I give it a 7.5\/10, maybe even an 8\/10.

Not that Ice Cube is the biggest celebrity of the planet, but he is an actor I appreciate; too much. He is honest, simple; pure. He is a rapper, a musician who writes songs for films, and is good at it, besides being a low profile artist. Plus, he is a very good actor who does what he pleases and likes to and never disappoints. With the production company he has, he could have the highest ego, but he continues on doing his job.In 1998, he got his chance to direct his movie; his first and only up to date. He wouldn't do the stupid gangster films the other rappers do because he takes the job seriously; so seriously he wrote his own neighborhood and people story, which is unexpectedly touching in its most impressive moments. He had done that type of film before, with independent man John Singleton, among others in that film I regret not seeing yet, Boyz N' the Hood. Whether he got inspiration from there or not, I don't care, but the screenplay is his.In his tale, where he also allows a role for him, we meet Diana (a powerful and gripping performance by Lisa Raye), a young girl and aspiring journalist with a lot of problems that drive her towards working on a strippers club, to get money and become Diamond. In Dollar Bill's (original Bernie Mac) club, The players club, she is not the typical stripper, dancing with all the others; she has a special number, and some clients. Every day she deals with cousin Ebony (Monica Calhoun), who lives with her and has more than two times her problems; her unfaithful boyfriend and the different people in the club, including DJ Blue (a calm portrayal by Jamie Foxx), who likes her.Like in any other story, these are not the only ones in Cube's vision&#133;There are lots of them and each of them has their own thing that relates to another thing. However, Cube always keeps the story focused in its center point. His gift as a director (because he could have sucked) comes with the importance he gives to the camera. He has a desperate need to show things as real as possible, even if it is a fiction story, so his camera moves like eyes most of the times, like afraid of watching what's waiting on the other side, so the impact is harder when we seed alongside the camera. It is a very effective technique.What is also captivating and remarkable, is how much of him we can see in the film. Like directors of the league of Scorsese or Oliver Stone, Ice Cube tries to makes us see what he sees. There are a few scenes with enormous violence; glasses that break, shootings, people hurt&#133;We feel it, and it is hard to watch. I was thinking about Spike Lee, and how personal his movies are. I was shocked with the ending of Do the right thing, but I understood it was just Spike Lee expressing himself.I don't know what exactly the message Lee wanted to give was, I don't know what was going through his mind at the time, just as I didn't know what was Ice Cube thinking, so he could end up showing The players club in flames during the first frames of his movie.

In no particular format or order people here have the wrong understanding of this movie. Congratulations all of you who both watched the movie and read the book. I am proud of you all. Truly you now have an acute and wondrous knowledge of both. So then you complain about something that is wrong with the movie and yet fail yourselves to describe it. Do not write here telling others interested in the movie or opinionated on the movie you can not describe how you felt after the movie. No one wants to hear such an insightful opinion. The fact of the matter remains The Mosquito Coast is a timeless classic along the lines of The Lord of the Flies. That feeling you cannot describe is your own lack of understanding. When you went to cut the movie down and say it managed to pull through the flaws unscathed you mean something like this movie was a revelation to me and my paradigm is forever changed in an enlightening way. Allie Fox is not racist when he refuses to by Japanese seal tape. And YES the book does have him say he doesn't want to fund the next generation of kamikazes but NO he is not acting irrationally. The kamikazes were real and so was the feeling that the future generations of Americans would be inferior to the present. This is how the general will or feeling is calculated by asking this to the public. Allie Fox is not selfish in yelling at his youngest son to be a man and dragging them to the middle of the jungle. Fox is taking steps he feels to be necessary to preserve the next generation and help that next generation become greater than the previous. Why does Fox want to introduce ice to the natives? The answer is complex. Fox can't watch his country die, a country that if any of you can imagine such a wild idea- has citizens who take pride in its history and its direction. These citizens want the next generation to be greater than their own. Why is there so much immigration to the USA? Education is the primary means to make your children successful, and in the US we have education galore. Fox is not selfish and the movie is not flawed, it's your own flawed perspective and your own selfish need to make others believe you know what your talking about that creates a void which is ultimately lost in translation on your own part.

How do you rate a movie like this? On the one hand, it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen completely lacking in coherence, shameful acting, writing so bad it seems to be making fun of itself. In fact, I'm still not convinced this movie isn't supposed to be a parody of Christina Crawford's book rather than a serious attempt to adapt it to the screen.

This is the attitude that director Sidney Lumet takes (as he did with films like 12 Angry Men and Serpico, the later also starring Al Pacino) with Dog Day Afternoon. Bank robbery films are a staple in cinema since The Great Train Robbery filmed in 1903. However this story (not even saying based on a true story, just saying 'this is a true story' is enough) is set in 1972, and filmed a couple of years later, at a time when attitudes in society were changing, as was storytelling. Lumet here could get away with things he couldn't get away with if he tried this in the 50's; with unapologetically homosexual (but truthful is the key) characters, one of them the lead character; surprises that add to the unconventionality of the style of the film; and an ending that will keep you guessing. Lumet did a lot of good with this movie, and in a small way some not so good; people would look at many bank-robbery pictures that would come after this and size them up to this, as it was almost transparently influential (the 'Attica, Attica' tirade is something a child knows years before he actually sees the film).But its the honesty in the truth of the story and problems of the main characters, and in fact the lead up to the robbery and the (unsuccessful) robbery has truth out of it. It is manipulative in a sense, as it is so truthful artifice is almost excluded entirely from the picture. Take when Sonny (Pacino) and Sal (John Cazale) first whip out their guns in the bank. Their friend can't take it and wants out. This is a great moment, and the film has them scattered about. In some ways these great parts and scenes make up for the fact that beneath it all is a story that we have seen too many times (the robbers faced with intense media attention, wanting a plane to take the hostages, etc), or maybe not; maybe one has to put the film into context of the period. But a scene, for another example, when Sonny talks to his 'friend' on the phone. This is one of those moments where Pacino is of course as always 'Pacino', but also totally immersed in the character and the situation. Lumet lets this play for painfully real results.Dog Day Afternoon is one of Lumet's grittiest successes, as he takes the city he's made most of his films in, New York, and gives it the right tone, inside the bank and out, for this story of eventuality to unfold. The opening montage, with an Elton John song in the background, really has little relevance to the rest of the film, except to set up mood, and style, and it is a wonderful style (interestingly, the rest of the film aside from this opening is without music, another touch of the gripping realism). In a way, as I mentioned, its almost TOO intense, and too spectacular in the power that it has. This is Al Pacino in his prime, after all, off the heels of Serpico and The Godfather films, with his Sonny loaded with vigor and ambition and delusions of grandeur. John Cazale's Sal, by the way, is equally convincing in his own right, bringing a level of sanity to some of Sonny's over-the-top ideas. This film, and its actors and characters and Dede Allen editing, is almost a blue-print for how many other films that would come after this would take. One almost wonders what's the point of all of it, but when it makes its moments to shine, its dynamite.

Just because you've always dreamed that your son would be an astronaut doesn't mean that your son doesn't dream of being a fireman. Think about what happens to a moth when you capture it in your hands. A moth has what can best be described as a thin powder coating on its wings. If this powder is wiped off, the moth loses its ability to fly and very soon thereafter dies. Now, all the moth has to do to survive is stop attempting to fly away. But, nine times out of ten, that moth will keep beating its wings until the 'dust' has all been pulled from its wings and stuck to your palms, at which point the moth's fate is sealed. Just as our moth will die before it will give up flying, so will the man who hears his calling die before being sculpted by another's dreams.

He brings to the role a similar combination of cool sophistication with a hint of toughness as Steve McQueen, the King of Cool, brought to the original. (I have always thought that McQueen would have made a great James Bond if the producers had ever felt they wanted an American in the role).The new film follows roughly the same plot as the 1968 version, with one or two minor variations. The setting is transferred from Boston to New York, and the millionaire tycoon Crown is British rather than American. The most significant change is that the robbery which Crown organises is not of money from a bank but rather of a priceless Monet painting from an art gallery. As in the original, he is pursued by an attractive female insurance company investigator with whom he becomes romantically and sexually entangled. As in the original, the trappings of Crown's millionaire lifestyle are much on display- his expensive cars, his exclusive New York residence (even more luxurious than was McQueen's), his private glider, his yacht. (In this version Crown is a yachtsman rather than a polo player, although he is still a golfer). Even the theme song The Windmills of Your Mind comes in at the end and Faye Dunaway makes a cameo appearance as Crown's psycho-analyst.Despite the similarities in plot, I felt that something was lacking compared with the original film. That film is one that you watch less for its plot than for its atmosphere of style and sophistication, the epitome of sixties cool. The remake never really captures this. To take an example, it dispenses with the famous game of chess during which McQueen is seduced by Faye Dunaway; instead the investigator (here called Catherine rather than Vicki) seduces Crown after they have been dancing together. To make a game as intellectual as chess sexy was quite an achievement on the part of the actors and director; it is much less of a challenge to do the same for dancing, an activity which has been described as the vertical expression of horizontal desires. The chess scene is memorable precisely because it is so unexpectedly erotic; the dancing scene is much more forgettable. The director John McTiernan dispenses with Norman Jewison's use of the split screen; that was probably the right decision, as that technique used today would probably have given the film a very dated feel, but McTiernan does not come up with anything equally distinctive to replace it. Pierce Brosnan is good as Crown, but I was less taken with Rene Russo's Catherine, who I felt (surprisingly for an actress who is a former model) lacked the sophisticated elegance of Faye Dunaway's Vicki.I make no apologies for comparing this film to the original version; film-makers who remake earlier movies are deliberately inviting such comparisons. It would be wrong to say that I disliked the newer version. In some respects it is superior to its predecessor; it has, for example, a more coherent plot. There are some humorous touches such as the scene where Catherine thinks she has recovered the missing painting, only to find that it is a fake painted over Monet's unknown masterpiece- Dogs at Cards. There is also a neat twist at the end when Crown (helped by a number of accomplices, all identically dressed with bowler hats and briefcases) succeeds in replacing the painting on the walls of the gallery under the noses of Catherine and the police. Seen as a romance\/comedy\/thriller, the remake is not a bad film. It is, however, a routine one. The original was not a great film, but it was never routine. It had its own quite distinctive style and personality, something the remake lacks. 6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"1 September 2005","score":"6 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":" As the original Thomas Crown Affair stood in roughly the same relationship to real-life crime as the James Bond films do to real-life espionage, the current 007 Pierce Brosnan was perhaps a natural choice to star as the new Thomas Crown.

It really is time for Scream to be finished or else the first film will be put to shame, so Wes Craven returns to the director's seat and does everything he can to end the series with a bang.

Cool DVD with lots of extra features that goes well with the collection, and look for the funny cameo by Jennifer McCarthy.**1\/2 out of **** ","genre":"Horror, Mystery"},{"date":"1 September 2005","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" William Shakespeare's masterpiece definitive romantic tale already had love, passion, tragedy and unbeatable literary genius.

This was an unusual film in that I was not sure whether I was enjoying it or not, but equally could not have switched it off. It was only when I found myself thinking about the film some days later that I realised what an excellent piece of cinema I had witnessed. Through IMDb I checked for other work by this director & came across The Sweet Hereafter. I quickly obtained a copy, and whilst watching it became spellbound by its slow burning intensity and the excellent performances of Bruce Greenwood, Ian Holm & the wonderful Sarah Polley.I needed to see more, and bought a copy of Exotica. This film is an absolute masterpiece. Again, like Sweet Hereafter it has a slow burning quality,accentuated by the repetitive nature of the lives of the main characters. Excellent performances from Bruce Greenwood, probably one of the most underrated & understated actors of his generation, Sarah Polley, Elias Koteas and the beautiful Mia Kirshner. As you watch this film, you wonder how the lives of these characters will eventually impact on each other, and your mind searches for possible explanations. When this explanation arrives, it hits you like a tidal wave, washing away any doubts that you may have had about the quality of Egoyans storytelling.After gorging myself on a surfeit of summer blockbusters, which although enjoyable at the time, like a Chinese meal, leave you empty again some few hours later, I needed nourishment for my mind as well as my eyes. The discovery of the genius of Atom Egoyan has provided this spiritual feeding.

Anthony Hopkins plays Mr Stevens, a Butler at Darlington hall who places the up most importance on servitude. Emma Thompson plays Miss Kenton, the head maid at Darlington Hall who consistently searches for affection from Stevens with intolerable failure. The story is a retrospective of stevens looking back over his life as he travels to meet Miss Kenton for the first time in nearly twenty years. It is a reflective story of a man re-evaluating the purpose of his life, his deeds, his actions, and his attempts to address what he sees as his failure of in-action, namely his remorse at having never told those he loves his innermost feelings. The performances are first class from both both Hopkins and Thompson, not to mention a reliable cast including James Fox, Christopher Reeves, and a young Ben Chaplin. Of particular note are Hopkins' and Thompson's reserved interactions. Both are first class at expressing a vast range of emotions, and Hopkin's refinement and awkwardness is a joy to watch.James Ivory's direction is excellent, the camera is often close in on the characters which emphasises the awkwardness felt by Stevens. There is good mix of smooth camera work and some hand held moments which keep the film fresh and moving, not to mention a few great wide shots, look out for the beautiful shot of the English countryside during sunset when stevens' car runs out of petrol. The excellent cinematography is used to its most effective in a scene when Miss Kenton is in distress and stevens enters the room , Hopkins remains off camera and all that can be seen is Thompson's face with an opened door on the left hand side of the screen. The dialogue ensues as the camera remains tight on Thompsons's face, a technique often use in Shyamalan's films.Overall, this film is gripping in an emotional sense, and even for those who are not normally interested in this genre of film should find it a real treat, highly recommended.

That's the basic plot--the subplot has these vicious, stupid-looking monsters suddenly appearing and attacking and raping women. Couldn't have anything to do with that fast-acting DNA a cannery scientist accidentally released into the water--could it? And wouldn't you know it--those monsters decide to stage a full-out attack just as the town is having a salmon festival!I'm making this movie sound more fun than it is. It does have its campy moments--most of the acting is terrible (Vic Morrow and Doug McClure are just in it for the money); the scientist is (of course) a talentless but beautiful, big-breasted blond (Ann Turkel); there are numerous pointless explosions; gratuitous nudity and a REAL dumb script. This is fun but it was all ruined for me by the rape aspect of this picture. There are two sequences we we see screaming nude women being dragged off and raped (it's SHOWN) by these disgusting monsters. This isn't funny or horrifying--just sick. When they attack the festival there are at least eight shots of the creatures attacking women (their fate is never shown). For me I just gave up on the movie when they go after a girl no more than 13! She's saved BTW.I was lucky enough to hear Roger Corman (who produced this movie) talk a few years ago. He discussed this movie and said he had problems with director Barbara Peeters. She shot GRAPHIC scenes of men being killed...but next to nothing of women. Corman asked her why she did that...she said she was trying to make a point (!!!???!!!). He said he went in and fixed it and shot the rape scenes. So he's to blame for this. Peeters and Turkel have gone on record publicly denouncing Corman for adding those scenes. Can't say I disagree with them.That aside this movie is fast-moving, never really dull and has TONS of blood and violence--the best sequence has Cindy Weintraub defending herself and her child against the creatures. And there's a great (if admittedly disgusting) ending.But I can't recommend this at all. The rapes were totally unnecessary and disturbing to watch.

Having seen the film in its original release, we were fortunate to see again in DVD format recently. With O Brother, Where Art Thou, the Coens are at their best. Joel and Ethan Coen gathered one of the best group of performers to be in the film. George Clooney is seen as Ulysses, or Odysseus in the Greek epic, the man at the center of the action. Never has this actor been given this great opportunity and he has responded in ways that bowled us in watching him portray his character on the screen. To say this is his best work in the movies, is perhaps not saying anything at all! Mr. Clooney can thank the Coens for trusting in him and giving him the role of his career.The rest of the cast is perfection. Most of the players are part of the Coen's troupe of talented players at their disposal to give life to their characters in film. John Turturro, John Goodman and Holly Hunter have been in other films by the brothers and shine in this movie. Tim Blake Nelson, Charles Durning, Del Pentecost, and Daniel Von Bargen, among others do extraordinary work for the Coen team.The musical score by T Bone Burnett is what makes this movie unique. The use of the music works so well with the film as does Mr. Clooney's singing. Roger Deakins' cinematography also adds a rich texture to the story. A must see for all Coen brothers fans!
