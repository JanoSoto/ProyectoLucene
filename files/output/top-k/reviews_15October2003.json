Mr Cyphre is owed a debt by a man who he helped become famous as a singer.  The man was hurt in the war and is believed dead although Mr Cyphre cannot be sure.  When Angel finds that the man may not be dead he follows the trail to the South where he encounters a range of characters from the man's past as well as encountering that voodoo is some way involved.  When key people in his investigation start being murdered, Angel is the main suspect and he must find the man to clear his own name.From the first moment Robert De Niro's character is introduced, the first twist is revealed to all but those with the thinnest grasp of word play.  The final twist may not be as obvious but the majority of the surprise is gone.  So then, it is to the film's credit that it works so very well despite this cat being out of the bag for most people.  The plot is still dark and clever in it's own right and works well as a basic detective story but also with the other meaning to most things.The dark atmosphere of evil and voodoo is gripping and well painted by director Parker.  The mugginess of the scenes in the deep south can be felt through the screen surprisingly well.  The cast do a good job as well.  It is hard to watch Rourke in video thrillers now and then see him doing such a good job here.  He carries this film himself.  Support from Rampling and a surprisingly naked role from Bonet (who was still best known for the Cosby Show at the time) add class.  De Niro's devil is great despite only having a few scenes.  The scene where he tell Rourke that some cultures believe that an egg is the symbol of the soul before eating one with an evil look in his eye is great.  His screen presence makes good on a small but important part.Overall this film will work best for those who are totally unaware of the twists and turns it takes but is still an effective and enjoyable thriller for those who see the twists coming or know what they are.

I just got done watching it for the first time, and remembering the 1968 original with Sandy Dennis, I thought I would check out some things on the IMDb. I am very mixed in my reaction to the remake. I actually thought that Reeves did one of his better jobs here. I like to watch him in the movies. I don't think he is the greatest actor around, but I think that he improved by miles after being directed by Al Pacino in DEVIL'S ADVOCATE (also opposite Theron, by the way). But I can not review this version without comparison to the original film version. In 1968 a lot of the general population was just trying to get used to people openly living together at all. So this lifestyle of Sara's really did put a different spin on an otherwise, sort of, normalish, kind of woman. But for her to be taking in a different man for every month made her definitely not normal. The word used most often by the commenters of the '68 film was quirky. That simply does not apply to the Sara of Charlize Theron's era. Live together, don't live together, come and go, and especially in a liberal neighborhood of San Francisco, and OK, so who is going to notice besides the little boy across the street. So, did Charlie('68)\/Nelson('01') need some changing in their boring unfulfilled lives? Well, according to many, yes, but according to the way our society works these days, if that kind of work and business is your choice, than it IS necessary or you don't have a job. But, OK, we will accept that premise, and on we go. My question is this Does the perspective that Sara lives under really hold up in true life? Is it a valid and honest thing to do with the end of your days, to show people with holes in their characters, that life is full and wonderful and everyone should stop to smell the roses. Make it sound altruistic as a better way to live up to the end, than continuing with chemos that she has already been through, and likely would not work at all this time  around. But then to push those that do love you away? And she loved her family and Charlie\/Nelson too, but just wanted to be remembered as full of life! Is this not egotistical in the extreme?!? Is this not major fear of that inescapably absolute part of life, which is death?? Does this attitude and behavior in either film not belie every single thing she has chosen to do and live by, every time she takes and takes and takes again,  love from strangers for the REAL purpose of being remembered?

It was old out dated with sword fights with no imagination or description.  As it was written around 500 years ago (that number maybe wrong but who cares a long time ago) it boring stupid love story that could not even be fathomed to happen today.

Everything about seven is perfect. It is art captured on film. This movie is a bright spot for all of the stars who worked on it. Brad Pitt never gets the credit he deserves for his acting because he's a pretty boy and the press is a lot more interested about how he and Jennifer are doing. That's a shame because he is a talented actor that isn't afraid to take chances with both the roles that he picks and the characters that he plays. That is quite rare in the A-list world. Morgan Freeman is a great actor. You can always count on him to do what he does best which is play a wise veteran that has seen it all. Kevin Spacey is another great actor that has great range and really puts life and personality into his characters.The real talent of this movie, excluding the actors that brought it to life, is the director David Fincher and the writer Andrew Kevin Walker. Fincher's talents for making a visually stunning film are now well known and he often brings a dark patina to his work. Andrew Kevin Walker must have some incredible demons living inside him. Either that or one hell of an imagination for bringing the intricate story of Seven and the plan of John Doe to life. John Doe's plan really is twisted and I won't be spoiling it here. Suffice to say I have never seen so evil and complicated a plan in a movie before or since. The cinematography of the film is dark but beautiful and throughout the film it is either night or raining or both except for two very brief moments. It is such an emotional movie that you can't keep from being caught up in what is happening. Do you understand and sympathize with what John Doe is doing or do you think him a mad killer that must be stopped.Bottom Line If you haven't had the opportunity to see Seven yet then you must at least rent it. It is so damn good that I know you will like it. The only reason you wouldn't is because you're just too damn fragile to take something this hardcore.

Everything about seven is perfect. It is art captured on film. This movie is a bright spot for all of the stars who worked on it. Brad Pitt never gets the credit he deserves for his acting because he's a pretty boy and the press is a lot more interested about how he and Jennifer are doing. That's a shame because he is a talented actor that isn't afraid to take chances with both the roles that he picks and the characters that he plays. That is quite rare in the A-list world.

Right from the getgo, I was interested. I liked the idea of a state-wide penal system, where there is no law except for those with the power to enforce it. That would be The Duke (Isaac Hayes, in an inspired choice), who may have captured the crashed president who has crucial summit information. The cops don't want to get their hands dirty, so they send in Snake Plissken, because he's a former military specialist and simply because he's available. I loved Snake like I thought I would. Players of said game will instantly recognize the influence A self-preserving, mercenary attitude, rugged good looks, and an unmistakable hush in every word spoken. While Russel is my favorite actor and has tremendous power to his louder tones, he somehow pulls off this character's quietness just as well. It's not a Clint Eastwood ripoff, but I'd say there are shades of good 'ol Dirty Harry in there just the same. After meeting the enigmatic character, who doesn't give a f*** about your war OR your president, we watch as he enters NY in a plane that lands upon the Twin Towers, which is actually difficult to watch in today's times.

The scenes go from the streets to some deserted buildings to a strange, sort of pointless gladiator match, and then the finale which I found to be anticlimactic.

Sandwiched between A Fistful of Dollars and the finale, The Good, the Bad, & the Ugly.  This film provides further insight into Eastwood's Man with No Name.Eastwood is a bounty killer who is in search of the feared bandit known as El Indio. Colonel Douglas Mortimer (played by Lee Van Cleef) is in a similar position, and the two cross paths many times in their pursuits of El Indio. The premise has similarities to that of the first, and in fact won't be all that surprising to most younger viewers. But at the time, the various plot turns and twists were unique and revolutionary. The pace is both a pro and con at the same time. Unlike modern films, the usual western showdown scenes unfold very deliberately. Rather than simultaneously begin and end in a furious volley of bullets, the encounters are set up slowly. On the bright side, this gives both the characters and the viewers an opportunity to fully appreciate the choices made and the consequences that will follow. From a negative perspective (not mine), one might say that the gunfights are plain slow, and the action is too sparse. While I enjoyed the change of pace, I also understand why some will say otherwise. Others portions of More can hang with any western sequences ever put on film. Highlighting the action is a robbery scene, the creativity of which ranks with any modern heist out of The Score or The Italian Job.This trilogy catapulted Clint Eastwood to Hollywood fame, and one can see his star-making charisma ooze through the screen. Blending stoicism and machismo wonderfully, Eastwood produces the epitome of the tough and arrogant loner cowboy. In a role that could easily have been overshadowed, Van Cleef holds his own against Eastwood. His character was probably similar to Eastwood's in his youth, but Van Cleef accurately reflects the wisdom that would likely come with his character's age. The motley crew of baddies is filled with men who completely look their parts. That's about all that is asked of them, and they deliver. The cinematography of More follows in the groundbreaking footsteps of Fistful. While one might not notice anything revolutionary now, at the time shots like that had scarcely been seen. Shots like the low-angles utilized prior to a few shootouts, as well as the framing of space are all now staples of cinematic westerns, and they originated here.Ennio Morricone's score is also a classic. Whether serving as epic background music for sweeping crane shots or providing aural cues during action sequences, the music is always appropriate and often the best part of the film. Bottom Line While it might not seem as great now, so much of this movie was groundbreaking and remains classic that it merits 8 of 10.

The motley crew of baddies is filled with men who completely look their parts. That's about all that is asked of them, and they deliver. The cinematography of More follows in the groundbreaking footsteps of Fistful. While one might not notice anything revolutionary now, at the time shots like that had scarcely been seen. Shots like the low-angles utilized prior to a few shootouts, as well as the framing of space are all now staples of cinematic westerns, and they originated here.Ennio Morricone's score is also a classic. Whether serving as epic background music for sweeping crane shots or providing aural cues during action sequences, the music is always appropriate and often the best part of the film. Bottom Line While it might not seem as great now, so much of this movie was groundbreaking and remains classic that it merits 8 of 10.

Sandwiched between A Fistful of Dollars and the finale, The Good, the Bad, & the Ugly.  This film provides further insight into Eastwood's Man with No Name.Eastwood is a bounty killer who is in search of the feared bandit known as El Indio. Colonel Douglas Mortimer (played by Lee Van Cleef) is in a similar position, and the two cross paths many times in their pursuits of El Indio. The premise has similarities to that of the first, and in fact won't be all that surprising to most younger viewers. But at the time, the various plot turns and twists were unique and revolutionary. The pace is both a pro and con at the same time. Unlike modern films, the usual western showdown scenes unfold very deliberately. Rather than simultaneously begin and end in a furious volley of bullets, the encounters are set up slowly. On the bright side, this gives both the characters and the viewers an opportunity to fully appreciate the choices made and the consequences that will follow. From a negative perspective (not mine), one might say that the gunfights are plain slow, and the action is too sparse. While I enjoyed the change of pace, I also understand why some will say otherwise. Others portions of More can hang with any western sequences ever put on film. Highlighting the action is a robbery scene, the creativity of which ranks with any modern heist out of The Score or The Italian Job.This trilogy catapulted Clint Eastwood to Hollywood fame, and one can see his star-making charisma ooze through the screen. Blending stoicism and machismo wonderfully, Eastwood produces the epitome of the tough and arrogant loner cowboy. In a role that could easily have been overshadowed, Van Cleef holds his own against Eastwood. His character was probably similar to Eastwood's in his youth, but Van Cleef accurately reflects the wisdom that would likely come with his character's age.

The one thing that struck me (me who uses a lot of sarcasm) is how much hurt was often put behind the barbs.  As one character says, she never talks deeply with any of her friends and never gets beyond the next barbed remark.  The fact that her life slides the way it does shows the danger in this.

Since then I have watched this brilliant blend of brilliant  writing, music and even better acting dozens, perhaps a hundred times.  Why should my comments weigh a little heavier than other posted?  Because I am only 21 years old.  This movie came out twenty five years before I did and my  love for it speaks of its timeless charm.  I won't give away one single hint of the  plot for those who are checking this having never seen the film.  Do yourself a  favor and let the picture remind us of a time ( a time some of us have never known) of great innocence and beauty.  I speak not only of 1916, when the film  took place but also of 1967 when shortly before his death Walt Disney himself  oversaw the making of this movie.  It has been said in reviews that this film was  supposed to compete with the earlier success of Mary Poppins and while the box office or revenue reports will show that the masses did not experience it, it  does not show that they would not have appreciated it.

There have been some stinkers dubbed Best Picture in the past, (Shakespeare in Love beating Saving Private Ryan???  The Greatest Show on Earth over High Noon?!  Spare us all) but this is not one of them.Even supporters of the film, writing reviews here at IMDb, can't seem to resist taking shots at Wings' plot, but I'm here to tell you it is just fine, even solidly written.  Some reviewers don't sound like they have seen this movie in a long time, or if they have, they slept through it.  For one thing, the Love Triangle is not as convoluted or hard to grasp as others have impliedJack Powell (Buddy Rogers) has a crush on one Sylvia Lewis (Jobyna Ralston), the local beauty queen.  She finds this cute and indulges it a little bit--actually too much.  But she is quite sincerely in love with someone else, David Armstrong (Richard Arlen) a well-off local boy who isn't quite able to figure out how to tell Jack to butt-out because it doesn't involve money.  The wild card in all of this (literally and figuratively) is Mary Preston (Clara Bow), who lives next door to Jack and has been mooning over him since she was a little girl.That's the whole dynamic.  I have no idea what someone was thinking when they suggested Mary expressed any feelings for David (She never does). Some have said they can't believe Jack would go for Sylvia with Mary next door. I see their point, because the casting of Clara Bow in her role is like having Kirsten Dunst living next door and not noticing.  The problem is, Jack isn't SUPPOSED to notice Mary until the end, when he has experienced the war and realizes that everything he wants is right there at home where he belongs.  In the beginning he is all about Fast Cars and the Trophy Girls.So, the plot thickens as the US gets dragged into World War I and both Jack and David sign up as pilots.  Naturally each of them heads to Sylvia's house to say good-bye.  Sylvia prepared a locket with her picture in it for David, but Jack sees it first.  This scene is a great display of awkwardness wrapped in etiquette, especially when Sylvia tries to let go of Jack's hand. Jack takes the locket from her, and, this being more than she can stand, Sylvia almost gets the words out to tell him the truth when David gets there.  At this point Jack turns on the macho-factor, and he is so gleeful about rubbing Sylvia's locket in David's face that he doesn't even notice she never kissed him good-bye.Sylvia makes up for David's loss of the locket with some tender words and some passionate kissing--no mystery where her feelings lie--and the three of them head off for war.  Three, because Mary goes too, as a nurse.  Another complaint about this film and it's plot has been that Clara Bow wasn't given enough to do, shunted off into a side part even though she got billing as the Leading Lady, but I just don't see it.  Her part was as big as any Romantic Interest in most movies out there; a good example for comparison would be Kathleen Quinlan's roll in Apollo 13.  Most of her scenes were not shared with Tom Hanks, but she turned in an emotional and Oscar-nominated performance nonetheless.The air battles in this film have never been topped anywhere.  Ever.  And that includes anything involving aliens, fighter jets, or a galaxy far, far, away.  The information that the actors flew their own planes is misleading. Actors couldn't do what these pilots do.  The stunt flying is by the US Army Air Corps in Texas (!) where the movie was filmed (I dare you to have guessed that on your own).  What Rogers and Arlen do is all their own close-ups, flying the plane as they careen and dive.  When the camera ran out of film (or the planes ran out of gas) a stunt pilot from the Army would pop up and land the plane.The resolution of the story I won't comment further on, except to say that it is extremely moving and does highlight the madness of war, especially the kind of war WW1 was.  I support military action for just causes, but everything has a cost and Wings lays that cost bare.  These were issues being struggled over long before Vietnam, just in case you thought Hippies invented protest.After complaining that she didn't do enough, some people insist that Mary's tactics in Paris were out of character.  No they were not.  Mary had to get Jack away from that other woman and get him his orders before he got court marshaled.  She was not becoming a floozie, only dressing the part, and she paid the ultimate price for the risk she took.  It also helped to stir up Jack's feelings about her in later scenes, and get him thinking.Wings!  Melodramatic?  Sure.   Unoriginal?  Well... if you make that claim because you can guess what's coming or you've seen it all before, just ask yourself how old these movies are that you are comparing Wings to, and check Wings' release date again.  Maybe the plot-heist occurred in the other direction.This film deserves a DVD release.    Barring that, see if you can track down the old Paramount Laserdisc, LV 2851-2, which is what I had.  I have been enamored with, and watching, this film since I was 13 (30 now).

His chronicles of the land of Narnia occupied many a night's reading growing up. So it was with trepidation that I watched a movie about his adult life, wondering if it would impair in some way my memories of that fabled land. And early on, I began to regret it, as we saw a man living in a dull world, with very little to connect him to the Narnia other than the fact that for him, it was a way to escape as well.  What the movie did in the end, was connect me in a way emotionally to his life, and truly make a difference in the way I view the world.As with nearly all movies based on true stories, Shadowlands does have some problems.  When comparing the events in the movie with the real life of C.S. Lewis, you seem to lose grip of things like the amount of time that passes (While the events took more than 8 years to pass in real life, the movie makes them seem as though they happened in a very short period of time) and some things don't appear to be entirely based on fact (weren't there two sons?) but rather are put in place for dramatic purposes only.  However, the movie's main goal is to show the transformation in thought that occurred in Lewis's life, and the transformation in his view of the world.  That, it accomplishes spectacularly.The idea of Debra Winger and Anthony Hopkins becoming involved in a romance seems somewhat silly considering their difference in age, but this only adds to the power of the movie, since in real life, Lewis was 17 years older than Gresham.  The duo perform their usual outstanding jobs, and Winger's Oscar nomination was well deserved, although I personally thought Hopkins turned in a much more powerful performance and deserved one as well.  The fact that he was nominated that same year for Remains of the Day probably hurt his chances for a 2nd nomination.Overall, the movie is incredibly well acted and directed.  The scene with Hopkins and Joseph Mazzello near the end of the movie as they sit in front of the wardrobe is one of the most powerful scenes I've ever seen, as it not only brings us to a wonderful finishing moment, but shows two actors dealing with a tough scene in fantastic manners.  The moral of the story is a life-changing one, and is summarized by the last line in the movie.

With relentless emotional manipulation piled on top of wooden acting & a dreadful script. See how bad the world treats Sam. See how good this simpleton is to his daughter. How pure his love, how corrupt & selfish the normal people are. Blah blah blah. Pass me that empty popcorn bag, I'm gonna hurl.It isn't that the story hasn't got a point, but that it is horrificaly overplayed, the message being delivered in industrial amounts. It's like expecting a teaspoon of sugar in your coffee & getting 2lbs of sacharrine dumped in it instead.The clumsy manipulation isn't limited to the script, with wooden, cliched characterization & oh so obvious directorial & cinemagraphic tricks. Notice how the scenes are technicolor when Sam is with his daughter, but have a cold, blue, almost monochrome color during the court scenes. Sublety seemsnot to be this film's strong point & wherever there is a chance to drive a point home with a sledgehammer the opportunity is taken to do so with obvious enthusiasm.Michele Pfiefer is normally watchable, but this has to be her first role where I couldn't bear to look. She does her best with the part, but ultimately the clunking story & dialogue leave her trying to shine while carrying a dead albatross round her neck. God only knows why she agreed to add this turkey to her resume. Maybe it seemed a good idea at the time. Maybe it simply paid well & the rent on her mansion was due.Sean Penn is simply diabolically bad, unconvincing & puke inducing as Sam. Laura Dearn ambles through looking like she's smelt something bad. The rest of the cast simply wallow around, subsumed by the crushing sentimentality.This whole film stinks. The one area where there is some very limited relief is the soundtrack, where Beatles tunes are played. Even here this is spoiled, for a start they're all pretty sub standard covers by other bands & even then we only get snatches.When you consider how many great film ideas never get anywhere you have to wonder just how this pile of poop ever got onto the screen. I gave it a 1 on the IMDB voting, but I would have given it a big, fat zero if I could have.
