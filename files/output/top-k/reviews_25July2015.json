Can't say I've seen anything like it. It will make you think and it has a few moments that are a little frightening. I really didn't have any expectations for this film other than knowing that Pacino and Keanu Reeves were in it and It had an intriguing title. The plot is basically a lawyer, Kevin Lomax (Reeves) who moves to NYC and starts working cases for a new boss, John Milton (Pacino). You can tell early on that there is something different about his boss, he acts very corrupt. Later we find out that he is the devil. Reeves is working on a case where he has to defend a child molester and bad things start happening. His wife, Mary Ann who was played by Charlize Theron, starts to lose her grip on reality. She starts seeing things that aren't there. Towards the end of the movie, she kills herself in a mental institution. Theron was probably the best actor in this movie, i thought that Pacino and Reeves were just okay, I didn't come away thinking that they excelled in their roles. The movie has a few twists and turns that i didn't expect. Late in the film, we find out that most of the movie was a bad dream showing Reeves what would happen if he followed through in defending the molester. So, the ending is Reeves deciding to not defend his client and instead go with his conscious. The only issue is that the media is all over him for making such a decision. Pacino goes on to say that vanity is his favorite sin.7.5\/10 The score in this was fantastic, it gives off a very eerie vibe. The acting was just okay for the most part and the story was crazy. It all makes sense in the end but for a while it just seems to be chaos. Overall, it's a solid film that is complicated to understand the first viewing. I like the idea in this film, it could have been even better. Not really a classic in my opinion.

Mine will be a philosophical review. The film is great because of its spiritual depth. Scott deepens Maximus,What we do in life, echoes in eternity. Elysium is very real and is integrated into his bravery. The tragic murder of his wife and son at the hands of evil Commodus is a great transformation of Maximus. He was brave to this point but now, he is consumed with a lust for vengeance that changes him. He is much like Harmonica in the great Once Upon A Time In The West; his life is either death or vengeance whichever comes first. This is what gives his great deeds in the arena believability. His friendship with Hounsu adds emotional depth to the role. His goodness is never lost completely in all that pain and anguish. We see that when Lucilla first comes to visit him. His pain consumes him so that his goodness can barely restrain him from killing her. If you asked me what is the core of this film, I would reply one word nobility. A word long lost within our merchant's zeitgeist where everyone and everything is for sale. Here, notice how all how come in contact with Maximus change and develop deep respect for him. Even, the world weary misanthropist Proximo, who trusts no one and laughs at Maximus when he first asks him if he is in danger of becoming a good man; Proximo does, he pays for it with his life, but he does become a good man.Like DePalma's works, goodness comes with a great price. Marcus Aurelius' choosing of Maximus has such disastrous consequences for his life. We understand why the emperor chose him, because of the very nobility we are discussing. Unfortunately, and Fatally, the emperor underestimated Commodus' depth of ruthless ambition that would tolerate no interlopers. I understand the objections of historical inaccuracy but really, the point of the movie is the modeling of nobility that dies for doing what is right. As a philosopher, the good that comes from teaching others to perform right, be prepared for the heavy cost, produces a much better society and I couldn't care less if it is completely veracious. The scenes of Elysium, especially the last one, as Maximus lies dying on the ground are so beautiful and give the film such depth and power. It reminds me of the dove flying away in Blade Runner. Within this zeitgeist, metaphysics are quite forbidden and I praise Ridley for having the courage to put it in his movie.The cast and the acting are excellent. The movie may be long but it never drags. Again, for those who found his achievements unbelievable he has lost all fear like Harmonica. Also, he is a general of many decades; I did not find it outside the realm of reality. Why is it a masterpiece? Because it teaches what it costs to be a good man. He pays with his very life's blood but he dies in peace unlike the cowardly, terrified Commodus. Good people never need fear death. Watch the film for the nobility that it shows; for all his violence, his goodness and his great heart remain. Within our reality, here and now, it is a very timely lesson. Sending the light and thinking good thoughts cost nothing and accomplish nothing. Maximus shows you the terrible cost but who doesn't want to live and die so nobly? Good is always to be performed at any cost. Die with the sword in your hands, fighting for good, my friends. Take it from someone who stood over the helpless for 20 years, this movie changed me.

In my opinion, it marks the beginning of the golden era of largely flawless Hitchcock films that runs for 15 years through the release of The Birds in 1963.The movie is based on a play by Patrick Hamilton, inspired by the Leopold-Loeb case. The film follows two young men, in one apartment, on one night, as they throw a dinner party for a bunch of people that were close friends of both themselves and a third young man they have just murdered for no reason other than to have experienced the act of doing so. For the added thrill, they throw the victim's body into a chest from which they serve their guests their buffet dinner.The dinner guests include David's father, who is making constant references to how he is worried about how his only child is missing when David doesn't turn up where he is supposed to, and how his wife, David's mother, is most consumed with worry. Janet, David's current girlfriend, is also invited, as is Janet's old boyfriend. These two interact very awkwardly, to the delight of their murderous hosts, until the end of the party. Janet explains to her old flame how she took up with David because of love, not because of his money, and when her old boyfriend sees that Janet genuinely cares for David, the two reach a truce. The point of all of this conversation at the party is to show that David - as is true with all human beings - isn't some inferior lab rat that the two murderers had the right to exterminate as a means of spending an otherwise boring afternoon. He is a human, as important as any other, who has people who care about him and will obviously mourn his death.James Stewart is great as the murderers' former teacher, Rupert, who solves the mystery that the two killers have pretty much dared him to discover and solve. Hitchcock was always able to direct James Stewart to play just about any role he could dream up without letting Stewart's every man quality get in the way of the quality and believability of his performance. It is interesting to note that at the end of the film, from James Stewart's final speech to the two murderers, that we assume the pair will be tried for murder and executed. Some people don't know that although Leopold and Loeb - the inspiration for this film - were sentenced to life in prison for their crime, that Leopold was released on parole in 1958 after serving 33 years, and lived another 13 years in freedom before his death. Loeb was killed by another inmate in the 1930's, otherwise he would have likely been paroled eventually, too. Since Leopold and Loeb killed a child rather than another adult, we can't really be sure what would have become of Hitchcock's two murderers had this been a real life situation.The one thing that did surprise me was on the DVD commentary, when it was mentioned that the two murdering college students were homosexuals, and that Hitchcock pushed the envelope on innuendos on this subject just as far as he thought the censors would let him. Maybe I'm just dense, but I never got that vibe out of the movie at all, until I was told that it existed in the first place.Rope is just a little over an hour long, and is performed entirely in one room of one apartment. It is a psychological thriller, not one of Hitchcock's action thrillers. It's definitely worthwhile for any Hitchcock fan, but it might disappoint someone who buys this without knowing the movie's format and is expecting something like The Man Who Knew Too Much or North by Northwest.

Maybe I'm just dense, but I never got that vibe out of the movie at all, until I was told that it existed in the first place.Rope is just a little over an hour long, and is performed entirely in one room of one apartment. It is a psychological thriller, not one of Hitchcock's action thrillers. It's definitely worthwhile for any Hitchcock fan, but it might disappoint someone who buys this without knowing the movie's format and is expecting something like The Man Who Knew Too Much or North by Northwest.

It was called Lady and the Tramp, and it was amazing. As such, a tale about even more dogs, this time without the warmth and the charm of the previous ones, just didn't feel as successful.Problem number one, Pongo and Perdita. I just don't get these two. They're supposed to be the main couple, the heroic parents who save their children, but I don't get anything from them. Their owners, Roger and Anita, are a great couple, one of the best of the so called beta couples Disney has ever done. But the main couple. Nope, don't work.The second problem, the copying. A lot of this movie's plot lines and scenes have been copied from previous Disney movies. Mainly from Lady and the Tramp. It's not really all that noticeable if you don't watch them back to back, but if you do, it's kind of blatant. Plus the animation style utilizes a lot of copying because of the new Xerox method of animation that allowed them to animate all those individual dalmatian puppies without going stark raving mad. Which I give them props for. This movie looks noticeably rougher when compared to the ones before it, but it is a very impressive technical achievement anyway.The first good side, the villain. Cruella De Vil has since achieved almost legendary status as a Disney villain, and for a reason. She's petty, nauseatingly glamorous without any of the grace that usually goes with it, just one push away from cuckoo land and absolutely mad about fur even when not pushed. In a word she's memorable, even though her actual plan is really not that ambitious when compared to her brethren. She just wants a coat.The second good side, the music. This film has some great tunes, from the classic Cruella De Vil to the opening scene with its early 20th century London suburbia.As a whole this movie is something of an uneven package. It has definite upsides, but also equally as definite downsides. It is a very good film, don't get me wrong, great even, but only when not compared to other Disney films too vigorously.

Every scene is well thought, well played, visually brilliant, almost nothing is extra, nothing is lacking. I would recommend it to anyone.Two main characters seem to be very opposite, however, when they get to know each other, it turns out they have a lot in common, they are both perfectionists searching for a real thing, just in different ways.There is a very tiny line between a woman who sleeps with many people, and a woman who sleeps with nobody. Jessica seems to be very shy, very reserved, and proper, while actually deeply inside she keeps her sex appeal under the lock. Helen, who is very sexual and very experienced in practical stuff, realizes immediately how sexy Jessica actually is. That is why she keeps being so patient and persistent with her, waiting for Jessica's sexuality to come to the surface. That is the best quality of the movie two women from different universes actually come to the same they are so much into each other, once they give each other a chance.What is naive in this movie is the end. In general, the film very sharply shows how smart, intelligent, and opinionated women in NY are simply wasting time by looking for a perfect guy. There is no such thing for them, and instead of pleasing their families and friends expectations, they should look for alternative ways to find happiness - and it often turns out be a happiness with women. While the break up of Helen and Jessica in the end is still believable, since they both still have a lot to explore, it is very naive to hint that Jessica is in the end excited for meeting that guy, Josh, whom she has already dated in the past, and whom she dropped long time ago, without any interest. In spite of Josh now becoming a writer, it is not realistic to believe that a woman who moved on, and developed herself and her self-confidence, would now go back to the deprecating, judgmental and macho guy whom she dropped even when she was much less experienced, and much less self-confident. I see this part of the movie as nothing but simple lip-service to hetero audience who still would like to see a boy with a girl in the movie.

When I first had the idea of watching this movie, I thought it was going to simply be a decent piece of entertainment. Little did I know that I was going to hate this film so much, that my blood would boil to the point of being considered lava. Before I continue on, I would like to note that I will be reviewing this film by the facts. I will hold off my opinion, until after the review.Story & Pacing- Little Nemo is the type of film where the adventure is the story and the story is the adventure. It's amazing how they took this really fun concept and botched it up. What adventure film has padding of all things in it? A lot of what happens in this 90 minute movie is more pointless than an unsharpened pencil. Some of the scenes start out whimsical, but soon the whimsy over stays its welcome. There are too many scenes where I feel as though I should end up learning something about the main characters, but instead I'm just watching characters do random things that don't add up to anything. If this movie wants to have creatively weird, funny, and random scenes for the heck of it, I'm completely alright with that. That's the movie I wanted to see. But in order to do that the scenes actually have to be entertaining all the way through. Since a majority of the scenes don't, they come off as useless filler. There's no excuse for that. Now let's talk about how this movie is supposed to be half fantasy and surrealism. The creators almost got rid of the surrealism entirely. There's only one point in the movie where the use the genre and it is the BEST SCENE IN THE MOVIE! No exaggeration. Lastly this movie pacing is pretty bad. It cuts to black so many times at unnecessary moments. Watching Little nemo honestly felt like watching a culmination of Saturday morning cartoons. Story score 3-5\/10 Pacing 4\/10Characters and Voice acting- There virtually are no characters in this film. I was never invested, nor did I learn anything about our so called main characters. These guys don't even deserve to be called tools, because, you know tools actually have a use. (I'm going to exclude Bonbon. You'll see later why.) Even our main protagonist Nemo is bland. He's an empty shell. I can only define him by his actions, and that's not a good thing. This boy can come off as rude, unlikable, boring, bratty, or even sexist at one point. The voice acting in the movie is weird to say the least. I understand that dubbing back then in the 1990s wasn't the best, but man are these voices mediocre. Some voices are okay, like Flip, Bonbon, and the king. But the other voice actor barely put up a fight. There can be some jarring inconsistencies too. Most noticeable is Princess Camille's on and off British accent. I wish I were joking. Characters score- 3- 5\/10 VO score 4-6\/10 Animation and Music- The music and sound effects are actually pretty good by themselves. Unfortunately the movie undermines them, making both the music and sound effects criminally underutilized, except for a couple of songs in the film. The animation is the most interesting part of the movie to me. The animation is nice and creative at small moments. I liked the style they were going for. A mixture of anime texture, combined with the shapes and designs from a comic strip. However there are two giant problems with it, first being the large amount of inconsistencies. You don't even have to nitpick to find them; they're always being blasted at you. Not seeing people have shadows on them when there should be is weird. Seeing Nemo's hair changes colors three times in the moves is glaring. The second problem would when the film's animation quality drops at random. I'm astonished how many times it happens. These problems are honestly embarrassing and unprofessional. Animation Score 6.9\/10 Music and sound effects score 6\/10Re-watch ability- Watched it a second time still didn't like it at all. I watched it a third time and I was less annoyed by it, but it still never grew on me. You're probably going to have mixed feeling on whether you want to come back to it. I watched this movie 3 times all because I just wanted to find other things to like about it. Unfortunately my search came up empty. Score- 3-5\/10 Final Score- 7 years of work and 35 million dollars went into this movie. When I look at that, I don't think of what could've been. I think about the 2007 movie Nocturna, which had a budget over 4 times less than this one, and a production history of 10 years. I rest my case. FINAL SCORE- A score range of a 3 to a 5.5. My opinion &#x96; I really don't like this movie. My main problem with it is that it doesn't know what it wants to be. I did like somethings in the movie. I LOVED the scene where the house was flooding, because they were using surrealism. I liked the character Bonbon. The voice actor did Him or Her justice. His or hers design was always consistent. Bonbon's purpose in the story was clear. He or she at least had a reason to be there. The intro song is great! But even with all that, I still hate this film. In a way I feel bad for little nemo, it's a dated film. And with each installment in the surreal genre of animation it gets worse. My personal score is a 3\/10.

This movie seems to be ahead of its time in several ways. Unlike other crime dramas of the thirties and forties, there is a lack of hammy dialog, no girl with a heart of gold standing behind her man - either criminal or police officer, and no background information given explaining the criminal's motivation, or any of the other plot gimicks that run from the early talkie gangster films into the crime dramas of the post-war era. Also, there is no mystery for the audience to solve, as the actions of the police and the criminal are clearly shown to the audience. The only question is when and how their paths will finally cross.Richard Basehart, who portrays criminal Roy Martin in this film, really owns the movie. He shines as a relentless sociopath whose only tender spot seems to be for his own dog. Because he doesn't associate with known criminals and lives quietly, he is exceptionally hard to track down. Basehart actually has very few lines, but he is great at expressing his state of mind through his gestures and facial expressions. The film's excellent cinematography surrounds Basehart's character with cold, deterministic pools of light and darkness so that he really does seem like some type of shadow of evil that has descended upon the city. The killer in the film was actually based on real-life criminal Erwin Walker. However, wanting to concentrate on both the crime solving techniques involved and the habits of the criminal, this interesting and lengthy backstory was omitted to keep the film tight and fast paced.Erwin Walker was a brilliant student at the California Institute of Technology, a radio dispatcher for the police department in his native Glendale, and something of a hero as a lieutenant in charge of a radar unit on Okinawa during World War II. Walker returned from overseas duty deeply disturbed, and set out on a crime spree of more than a dozen holdups and burglaries to raise money for construction of a death ray machine that he thought would somehow make another war impossible. Twice Walker shot his way out of police traps, escaping through the labyrinth of storm drain pipes under Los Angeles and eventually killing a police officer. He was sentenced to death, but was later found to be insane by prison psychiatrists, and his execution was postponed indefinitely. California governor Pat Brown commuted his sentence to life in 1961, and in 1971 Walker was granted a new trial due to his original confession having been found to be coerced. Remarkably, he was acquitted at the second trial, changed his name, married, and took a job as a chemist somewhere in Southern California, never to be heard from publicly again.Thus, just or unjust, the inspiration for this movie had quite a different outcome than the villain in the film. Of course, in 1948, nobody would have dared write such a screenplay and have expected to ever work in Hollywood again.I had always considered Cagney's portrayal of Cody Jarrett in White Heat (1949) to be the first real off-the-wall psycho killer in a major film. But I now think that distinction should probably go to Basehart's portrayal of Erwin Walker in this movie.

","genre":"Crime, Film-Noir, Thriller"},{"date":"25 July 2015","score":"","review":" At the time of Pixote's production in 1980-1981, over half of the cast of City Of God wasn't even an idea or even a twinkle in their father's eyes. Over two decades before the release of Fernando Meirelles' ultra-violent crime saga depicting feral youth growing up too fast in Rio, Pixote A Lei do Mais Fraco set the bar as high as Christ the Redeemer overlooks the city in terms of capturing an accurate reality of the brutal favela life. This hyper-realist, Oliver Twist-by-way-of-Larry Clark account of wayward Brazilian youth still by today's standards provides stark, grim and shocking imagery. Regardless of the generational gap, what truly separates Pixote from City of God is that it didn't need to use highly stylized violence to compel the viewer. It relied more on the realism and hopelessness of the characters, the blunt sexuality, and a much more punctual yet effective treatment on street violence and state power. In the beginning of the film, (and not every version may feature this) director Hector Babenco (who went on to direct some mainstream American films such as Kiss of The Spider Woman and Ironweed) makes a brief fourth wall breaking announcement of his intentions to depict the daily life of a child in the urban landscape of Sao Paolo. Within this prologue, he reveals the lead protagonist, Fernando Ramos da Silva as himself in his natural habitat.As the child on child violence in City of God seems sensational, when one of these children in Pixote does commit a heinous act, you see the innocence being chipped away frame by frame. Unlike the murderous, maniacal Lil Ze from Ciudad de Deus - who seems to attribute his penchant for crime to something inexplicably innate and evil inside him - Pixote and his cohorts start off as confused, troubled innocent kids who escape their prison-like orphanage and enter the crime world out of survival. In other words, Pixote strives to capture the root causes of youth delinquency, and puts it into a much more constructive context. As far as structure, Pixote is very much like Full Metal Jacket (although it came out five years before, I'm aware). It's split into two parts. The first is the children's experiences in a youth detention center, where they witness and unsuccessfully dodge sexual assault and corruption. This first act could serve as the basic training, complete with the vulnerabilities, the bonding and the resistance soon to follow as seen in Full Metal Jacket. Once a brave select group manages to escape after one of their fellow boarders mysteriously disappears, the four adolescents flee to Rio De Janeiro. Act two is the struggle and eventual dissolution of the four youngsters as they experience complications from drug trafficking, pickpocketing and prostitution in Rio, which offers some beautiful and gritty establishing shots of the city at night. These sequences are parallel to the urban warfare, sniper-dodging chaotic second act of Full Metal Jacket. There is one particular moving scene on the beach when the youngsters share their aspirations within their delusions of freedom and future success. It's just so inspiring yet depressing to see how much hope these kids still have after everything they have gone through. And their situations only gets worse. What makes Pixote even more ahead of its time is how it treats the theme of sexual identity so sensitively. In an incredibly powerful performance, Jorge Juliao, who portrays the gender dysphoric Lilica provides depth to the character. Lilica takes on a maternal role towards Pixote, as she is several years elder than the titular protagonist. This film demonstrates the ability of humans to overcome their differences in the name of survival and trust. There is genuinely a familial bond between the characters, but their dynamics are not restricted. In a time and place where LGBT representations in media would have been taboo, Lilica brings about a character that is far more multi-dimensional than anything US cinema has attempted to do up to that point. Juliao manages to balance the nurturing with the self destructive aspects of her character without slipping into the hysterical gay stereotype. Last but not least, the second half also displays the development of the runaways' relationship with Sueli, an aging yet destructively young at heart sex worker, brilliantly portrayed by Marilia Pera. The climax unravels as these kids move in with Sueli. They take on a pimp role and subsequently use her to bait clients that they can rob. As criminal amateurs, they must deal with their own priorities and their complex emotions come into play as they each search for a role within Sueli that she may not be able to provide for them due to her own insecurities. While it is certainly fair to debate if this is art or exploitation, in short, we could conclude that Pixote A Lei do Mais Fraco, is provocative and disturbing but necessary and politically resonant. When Larry Clark's Kids was released in 1995, it was critically summed up by Janet Maslin as a wake up call to the modern world. Well if Kids was a wake-up call, then Pixote was the equivalent of your car alarm going off in the middle of the night...and it's parked a block away. ","genre":null},{"date":"25 July 2015","score":"","review":" At the time of Pixote's production in 1980-1981, over half of the cast of City Of God wasn't even an idea or even a twinkle in their father's eyes. Over two decades before the release of Fernando Meirelles' ultra-violent crime saga depicting feral youth growing up too fast in Rio, Pixote A Lei do Mais Fraco set the bar as high as Christ the Redeemer overlooks the city in terms of capturing an accurate reality of the brutal favela life. This hyper-realist, Oliver Twist-by-way-of-Larry Clark account of wayward Brazilian youth still by today's standards provides stark, grim and shocking imagery. Regardless of the generational gap, what truly separates Pixote from City of God is that it didn't need to use highly stylized violence to compel the viewer. It relied more on the realism and hopelessness of the characters, the blunt sexuality, and a much more punctual yet effective treatment on street violence and state power. In the beginning of the film, (and not every version may feature this) director Hector Babenco (who went on to direct some mainstream American films such as Kiss of The Spider Woman and Ironweed) makes a brief fourth wall breaking announcement of his intentions to depict the daily life of a child in the urban landscape of Sao Paolo. Within this prologue, he reveals the lead protagonist, Fernando Ramos da Silva as himself in his natural habitat.As the child on child violence in City of God seems sensational, when one of these children in Pixote does commit a heinous act, you see the innocence being chipped away frame by frame. Unlike the murderous, maniacal Lil Ze from Ciudad de Deus - who seems to attribute his penchant for crime to something inexplicably innate and evil inside him - Pixote and his cohorts start off as confused, troubled innocent kids who escape their prison-like orphanage and enter the crime world out of survival.

He makes a point of telling Ben White (Reb Brown), the brother of the Dee Wallace character from the first film, the specifics of her death. When Ben is unable to deny the evidence, he heads off, with reporter Jenny Templeton (Annie McEnroe) in tow, for Transylania, to help Stefan in his werewolf killing mission.The story is absurd, the dialogue hilariously awful; poor Sir Christopher and Sybil have to utter some pretty dumb lines. The makeup effects are crude to the nth degree, but are delicious in their egregious lack of quality. The scene with the eyeballs exploding is pretty cool. In some ways, Stirba - Werewolf Bitch goes back to Gothic basics in a way by exploiting flavourful European Old World atmosphere. But it adds a lot of spice to the deal by being so damn trashy. The sexy ladies present dress quite provocatively, and Sybil is willing to disrobe and show off her ample assets. The New Wave pop soundtrack is a total hoot; we're made to listen to that priceless title theme song a number of times.
