Even the zero-budget production values contribute to its appeal because the cheap sets, lighting, etc, help to reveal the utter tackiness of the Kerrigan home which is in stark contrast to the family's buoyancy and richness of spirit.It is a quirky little movie that also serves a curiously noble purpose. After watching, my family is invariably reminded of the implied contract we hold with one another of total acceptance, unity, and unconditional affection. The Kerrigans, while basically ridiculous, yet manage to embody the kind of tolerance and respect we all want, such that their lexicon has added to the shorthand we use to express it. Icing sugar. Now, who would go to a restaurant.... That's going' straight to the poolroom. So much serenity! They're dreamin'. Whaddya call this? You could sell that. This I'm not even taking outta the wrapper. He dug a hole! It's the vibe o' the thing. Yes, the Kerrigans are ridiculous, and not least because they believe justice will be done. But the very fact that it is done directly results from their open, honest, egalitarian approach to life. Darryl befriends the Queen's Counsel completely unhampered by notions of class or self-consciousness; he sees only their commonality based on shared regard for home and family, and decency, and doing the right thing.The Kerrigans at first come across as naive or just plain ignorant but by story's end we are enchanted by--and not a little envious of--their purity of heart and childlike innocence. THE CASTLE is one of those movies we watch year after year and it never fails to charm us.

I remember the hype of it's release and to be honest had I viewed it back then I maybe wouldn't have been so generous. I hate hype, it can ruin a movie. I think the movie glossed over the characters and put too much emphasis on Woody. He was good too - although kept wondering if he was stoned the whole time. It never went too deep. Redford was dark but not too dark and his character let me down in the end. To me he should have been more confrontational with Demi - throwing her out perhaps or telling her that she was paid for. After all he would have investigated them before he made the proposal - that's not shown in the movie, but no one in his perceived position would have made an offer to just anyone. He was cruel to the point of breaking them up and the last straw was the house and yet Demi fell for him? The passages giving an insight to Demi and Woody's relationship were the best part of the movie. There was a keen deepness that outshone the shallowness of John Gages character. He really could have been a lot stronger and as other people have alluded I think the movies draw-card was Redford and they didn't want tarnish his image. I say what the hell Robert was old in this movie! Woody and Demi's characters were naive in a sense, but I think that was very intentional to draw you to their plight and champion their decision. But the reality is, they were losing their dream home and where did they go? Las Vegas? to gamble what little they had left and then accept a proposal from an insanely rich billionaire.

One of these films concerned mutant ants, so the conversation eventually led to my friend asking me if I watched a 1954 film titled Them which concerned the havoc caused by mutant ants. I said no and my friend loaned me the DVD a couple of days later and I was repeatedly asked over the last few weeks if I has watched said film. I wasn't intentionally putting off watching the film, but the opportunity just didn't arise for a few weeks. However, tonight I finally sat down to watch this old piece of science fiction and I must say that I am quite glad that I did.Patrol officers Sgt. Ben Peterson and Trooper Ed Blackburn are called into the depths of the deserts of New Mexico after it is reported that a young girl had been spotted wandering the desert alone. After finding the girl, whose doll's head is missing quite a chunk, the officers find the girl's parents' vacation trailer which has been completely destroyed on one side. There are a few strange things about the wreckage, however, the trailer looks to have been ripper from the inside out, no money is missing, and sugar cubes are scattered about. Also there is a strange footprint found. The officers then travel to a nearby dry goods store and find the proprietor dead his body having been slung into a cellar. Peterson goes for backup, but during his absence Blackburn is killed by a strange creature that makes a high pitched screeching noise. It is eventually discovered that the owner of the trailer was a member of the FBI so an agent, Robert Graham, is sent in. He has the footprint sent to Washington D.C. and two doctors from the ministry of agriculture arrive and we soon learn that a human is the not the culprit, but instead giant ants.Filmed some nine years after the atomic bomb testing in New Mexico, Them is a film that displays the fear of how nature and society are affected by the presence of such abominable objects of mass destruction. Similar to Godzilla in Japan, Them shows nature fighting back against the devastations that man has brought on himself. While this film could have easily just have been another bad B movie from the 1950s, Them is actually quite creepy in some parts especially with its use of audio and darkness. Those of us who are creeped out by bugs in general might received an additional watching this film.

It's truly interesting that The Exterminator can go much farther than Death Wish in depicting its violence and repulsive acts to get us to take the vigilante's side and yet still lack the complete watch-ability and power that Death Wish had. The main problem is with it's rotten script which leaves no breathing room for the characters. We aren't watching a movie about people, just one dimensional figures who function due to the ridiculous script. The action sequences are also particularly embarrassing with Ginty easily dispatching goons without breaking a sweat. One such action sequence finds Ginty in a hotel room shooting unarmed goons. What is also truly fascinating is just how hard it tries to disturb the viewer. With a politician who disfigures a teen hooker and then later seen having sex with a male prostitute who then is shot in the balls right after our exterminator sets the pimp on fire for expressing interest in buying young boys. This will offend you if you're not used to exploitation, but I for one found The Exterminator too unconvincing to even for a split second get wrapped into the sleaziness that this film wallows in. It is all so ridiculously phony, with it's right wing politics delivered in the most laughable way. I think the main problem with The Exterminator is that the vigilante in question is hopelessly unlikable. He grinds a mobster into hamburger for no real reason and in Robert Ginty it becomes obvious that he's no Charles Bronson. More lame plot twists ensue such as the CIA wanting to take him out for no good reason and the movie pretty much ends on the same note as it started. Complete indifference. As exploitation goes, this one lacks the power of say a Last House On The Left or I Spit On Your Grave and certainly doesn't hold it's own against the Death Wish movies or 80's action flicks in general. So what The Exterminator ends up as, is a great title without a narrative. Really as I look back at my notes, nothing is credibly explained and subplots are never resolved and all the action is gratuitous to the plot. This is an awful movie that has a cult following.

I used to watch Robotech(Macross), Gundam, etc... This is my first anime that I have seen in quite some time. I have aged significantly too, which means that I understand some of the conflicts that are brought up in some of the shows better than when I was younger. Recently Akira was brought to my attention as being the one of the best pieces of Japanese anime's ever produced if not the best. I was interested to see how well this would hold up to my film knowledge and criticism. To tell the truth, this would make a great live action flick if it could be done WELL. And I stress well, because there is also great potential to make this a piece of crap too. First off I found the artwork or animation to be quite refreshing. I haven't a good cartoon so wonderfully drawn in many years. I'm more used to crude animation like the old days. I only wish I could have seen this in theaters back in 89' or so. Sadly I wasn't born yet so therefore couldn't have possibly seen it. But I have the next best thing, a new clean DVD transfer that was done pretty well. The dub in English was pretty well done but I wish I could have had both the original dub and the new English one as well. I haven't listened to the Japanese language track because I never used to when I was younger. But hopefully now I have matured to the point where I will listen to it. The characters in the film feel and look very lifelike to me. Akria seems to borrow a lot from American films and throw them into a Japanses anime, which is very intriguing. I found out that the voices were recorded first before the animation, therefore; the lips would match the dialog perfectly. This is something that Disney has been practicing forever but that this was the first time it was used on a Japanese anime. Quite cool. Akira's story again is like a great director from the 20th century has created it. It has an essence that pull the audience into the world of Neo Tokyo 2019. A little Blade Runner, a little Children of Men and so on. The only nudge I have against the movie is not giving more insight to what Akira is. But I guess thats the great adventure to the film. That you really don't have a clue as to what Akira is, or who he is. I kept thinking that Akira would pop up somewhere and kill Tetsuo, and control Neo Tokyo once and for all. But this never happened and I'm glad it didn't. Just see the movie. I won't give anything away, but just to say that the end is a bit of a downer. Although, what great movie isn't. The film is immerse as it sucks the audience into a world that is dark and mysterious. It makes the viewer question his or her own life and choices we make in it.

Are fatherless boys more likely to attract aliens because they look for a father in every stranger&#133;? Perhaps over mothering has left the boys gullible and needy, susceptible to the influence of dominating spacemen&#133;. Maybe it's just because if left unsupervised, boys will get into all kinds of trouble&#133;. Ugh, what's a single mom to do! Although an undisputed classic, The Day the Earth Stood Still is extremely dated. It was made in the paranoid Eisenhower-era of wise old scientists and panic-stricken people, when a messianic alien named Klaatu lands in Washington DC (the center of the universe in 1951) with his robot enforcer Gort. Klaatu (née Mr. Carpenter, née Jesus the Christ) delivers a message of universal peace &#151; OR ELSE! He explains that the worlds he represents haven't so much solved their differences as made violence illegal, enforced by a race of Gorts who will immediately destroy any aggressor. His peace message is actually a warning Kill each other all you want here on Earth, but if your wars spread to other worlds the Gorts will get you.The script is at times either naive or ridiculous although parked in the nation's capital, the flying saucer is guarded by only two solders and a wooden fence. The Gort which had previously melted a tank with his eye-ray is shellacked in a plastic cube which doesn't hold him. A meeting of benign and selfless scientists is called to disseminate the alien message, but a trigger-happy military shoots unarmed Klaatu not only once but twice, finally killing him so Klaatu can be resurrected to more convincingly deliver his doomsday ultimatum. Earth will be judged by a higher authority&#133;.The reason this early '50s artifact is still praised is that it is barely sci-fi at all. Instead the film plays as a taught espionage thriller with long wordless sequences where Billy follows Klaatu to the spaceship, and later when Helen watches Gort bring Klaatu back to life. Solid directing by Robert Wise, noir-ish lighting and camera-work, and an ethereal theremin soundtrack by Bernhard Herrmann add gravity to what otherwise would have been a laughable display of alien power. When the Earth stands still, the result of selectively interrupting electricity for 30 minutes at noon (a noon that is apparently happening all around the Earth simultaneously as Moscow is frozen in midday as well&#133;), we see a montage of soda fountain malts that can't be served, cows that can't be machine-milked, and unsuccessful phone calls to complain about the power outage. Ohh, the horrors&#133;.There are really only three sci-fi elements in the film but they are all good Gort whose stoic silence and deathray make him cool despite being puffy foam and mitten-handed, the seamless flying saucer that dramatically splits down the center to open, and the saucer's interior a sophisticated executive office of louvered glass and mood-lighting that encloses the ubiquitous Lucite&#153; control panels in an uncluttered rotunda.But the real attraction is Patricia Neal as the single mother with hard choices and few options. Six years after WW2 how many war widows were in the same position, living at a boarding house and supporting a family on their own? She works in an office, but with the return of solders women were expected to get married and give up their jobs to the men. Her personal life is subjected to gossip from the elder boarders whom she must rely on to help care for her son.

The script is simplistic anti-war propaganda, but she alway seems to be playing several emotional levels at once, navigating her own suspicions while carefully speaking only in polite protocol.

It's blend of action, comedy, and drama is perfect enough that any moviegoer can find ultimate satisfaction with it. The story is fun, the dialogue is hilarious, and the situations range from hilarious to shockingly emotional and intense. In fact, the film is something like watching humor and seriousness fight it out. By the end, you're exhausted.The film's plot begins once the Persian Gulf War is over. Soldiers are celebrating, and a peace treaty between the U.S. and Iraq has been signed. Everything's cool. The morning after the celebration, three of the soldiers, Troy Barlow (Mark Wahlberg), Conrad Vig (Spike Jonze), and Chief Elgin (Ice Cube) come across a map in an Iraqi POW's ass. It is a map to millions of dollars worth of Kuwaiti gold, stolen by Saddam. The soldiers, not entire;y satisfied by the lack of action in the war, decide to steal the gold to make the time served worthwhile. A greedy special forces officer, Archie Gates (George Clooney) steps in, declaring himself the leader, and off they go. Shortly after they find the gold however, things quickly go wrong. Saddam's soldiers begin slaughtering Iraqi civilians, whom Bush had advised to rise up against Saddam. Putting humanity before greed, the men decide to help the civilians...The plot moves at a fast pace, and every scene is entertaining.

And don't even get me started on the ambitious reporter Adriana Cruz (Nora Dunn) and her dimwitted escort (Jamie Kennedy)... Moments like these come frequently, always hitting their comedic mark- and after the first half hour, are usually followed by stuff like a woman being shot in the head in front of her young daughter, and a torture scene that ironically brings much humanity to the Iraqi soldiers. The scenes often cancel each other out. Comedic scenes usually end in, or involve something serious, and much of the serious stuff involves, or ends in something funny (what is the deal with Michael Jackson?). And yes, the film is quite violent, and though not nearly as gory as war films such as Black Hawk Down, and Saving Private Ryan, there are still plenty of scenes that may churn the stomachs of squeamish viewers (the demonstration of how a bullet effects the body from the inside made me kind of nauseous).The performances are also great, and with a cast like this, I'm surprised that the movie doesn't have nearly as much recognition as it deserves. George Clooney is perfect as Archie Gates. He is sarcastic, greedy, and often rude, yet you take him seriously when his more selfless side emerges. Mark Wahlberg is funny in a strangely emotional way, as Troy Barlow. Spike Jonze is flat-out hysterical as the annoyingly lovable, poorly educated redneck, Conrad Vig. And Ice Cube, who is a great actor when given the right roles (Boyz N the Hood), is great, though he is given a bit less to do than his co-stars. After the hilarious first half-hour, his role rarely requires too much acting.The film is shot in a style that gives it a realistic look, and leaves you in need of air conditioning. The color appears to be on the maximum brightness level, and everything seems to have a reflection, even if all it reflects is bright light. The look gives the film a gritty and downbeat tone, which in a way makes the film even funnier, as the absurd humor almost comes as unexpected in such a real, and harsh looking film. Don't sit too close to a TV when watching this.The film is a masterpiece, one of the greatest films ever made in my eyes. It provides more sheer entertainment and pleasure than half the movies made these days. Watch it as the entertaining action-comedy-drama that it is, and don't worry too much about the political content, which is irrelevant compared to the fun.

I am desperate to watch almost every single Alfred Hitchcock there is. Yesterday I went to Hollywood Video and this was there. I watched To Catch A Thief. It is a very good Alfred Hitchcock comedy-thriller, but not his best work. It does not surpass his other incredible films like Psycho, Vertigo, Rope, North By Northwest, the Birds, Rear Window, or Dial 'M' For Murder. Still, this is one of his most famous ones. It is good. There are some great performances, great cinematography, and Alfred Hitchcock's usual utterly fantastic climax and sometimes complicated plot. The plot itself for To Catch a Thief is not too hard to follow, but it is a bit difficult to fit into words. I love the comedy aspects in this film, and the climax. The climax, as usual for Alfred Hitchcock, is the best part of the movie. Well, the climax for Psycho was not the best part of the movie, the shower scene was, but this film still has a terrific climax.Here is the plot for To Catch A Thief. There are burglaries happening all over France. The police suspect John Robie, a retired thief, is stealing jewelry. Robie tries to clear his name. He develops a plan to catch the thief in the act. He then meets Jessie Stevens and her daughter Frances. They have the most expensive jewels in France. Frances believes that Robie is the thief, but she falls in love with him anyway. Then, one night, Jessie's jewels are stolen. Frances suspects Robie. He then goes to a house and is attacked by a man. He says he is the thief, but his fake leg gives it away that he is not the thief. Frances then tells Robie she is sorry about suspecting him and she helps him plan out a plan to catch the real thief at a party. They then discover who the real thief is, a young French woman!Overall, this is one of Hitchcock's most creative movies with some suspense and some good humor involved too. Yes, it is not Alfred Hitchcock's best movie, nor his worst, but this is actually one of his most underrated movies. Sure, I was kind of suspecting that that young French woman was the thief but it was still a good twist. Did I mention the music yet? No, I did not. The music in To Catch A Thief was not the best, nor the most creative, but it is still a solid score. Anyway, this is one of the many fantastic Alfred Hitchock films out there that you should not miss. Sure, the first couple minutes of this movie are really boring, but trust me, it gets better.

(To my knowledge it has never been issued on VHS or DVD).I found the fist hour to be riveting with crisp dialog, interesting characters, and some nice camera shots by director Billy Wilder and photographer Charles Lang. Kirk Douglas was intense as Chuck Tatum and Jan Sterling (Lorraine Minosa) was pure film-noir platinum blonde with attitude.Then, the next 40-45 minutes disappointed me, to be frank. Tatum slowly softens to the point where the film loses its edge, going from an adventure story-film noir to more of a melodrama. Sterling's character almost disappears from the screen, which doesn't help. However, with 10 minutes left in the film, a shocking scene with her jolted me back to full attention.Going back to Sterling for a minute, if you are a film noir fan and rank Marie Windsor high on your list of actresses, you'll love Jan in here. It just wish she had a bigger part. My other wish was that this script would have been a little tighter. I drags too much in the second half. About 10-15 minutes cut out of here would have made this easier to watch and keep the suspense tighter.The story is not an unusual one. I've seen it on film a number of times, the from the classic era to now an overzealous newspaperman going past the bounds of good taste and ethics to get (or keep in this case) a good story going, just for the welfare of himself or his paper. Yet, this yellow journalism or tabloid mentality story has some different twists to it, such as being set in a mountainous desert, not in a big city.The acting is superb, not just with the two leads but with all the supporting actors, led by Porter Hall, who played the newspaper editor Jacob Boot. I also appreciated the sarcastic comedy in here as Wilder and the screenwriters parody the carnival atmosphere which develops when a tragedy occurs and people make a financial profit out of it. As the days linger on and the man in this story clings to his life trapped deep in a mine, the circus atmosphere grows. Hence, the second title of this film The Big Carnival.That latter title was used when the film bombed at the box office in America the first time it was shown. Later, it was reissued under that second title. It still bombed. However, today it seems to be getting cult status, I would believe a DVD of this will be forthcoming because my guess is that it would sell.

(To my knowledge it has never been issued on VHS or DVD).I found the fist hour to be riveting with crisp dialog, interesting characters, and some nice camera shots by director Billy Wilder and photographer Charles Lang. Kirk Douglas was intense as Chuck Tatum and Jan Sterling (Lorraine Minosa) was pure film-noir platinum blonde with attitude.Then, the next 40-45 minutes disappointed me, to be frank. Tatum slowly softens to the point where the film loses its edge, going from an adventure story-film noir to more of a melodrama. Sterling's character almost disappears from the screen, which doesn't help. However, with 10 minutes left in the film, a shocking scene with her jolted me back to full attention.Going back to Sterling for a minute, if you are a film noir fan and rank Marie Windsor high on your list of actresses, you'll love Jan in here. It just wish she had a bigger part. My other wish was that this script would have been a little tighter. I drags too much in the second half. About 10-15 minutes cut out of here would have made this easier to watch and keep the suspense tighter.The story is not an unusual one. I've seen it on film a number of times, the from the classic era to now an overzealous newspaperman going past the bounds of good taste and ethics to get (or keep in this case) a good story going, just for the welfare of himself or his paper. Yet, this yellow journalism or tabloid mentality story has some different twists to it, such as being set in a mountainous desert, not in a big city.The acting is superb, not just with the two leads but with all the supporting actors, led by Porter Hall, who played the newspaper editor Jacob Boot.

It is a seamless whole with driven performances by all of the fantastic ensemble cast. Of course this is just my opinion, but films like this, that disturb, that challenge the emotions, are the stuff of great drama.Is it true? Who knows? Who cares? It could be? Certainly court cases have turned on far slimmer circumstances than these. Remember the O.J. Simpson case. There are still too many unanswered questions there. So to be considered cheated by the outcome of the story here would be a big mistake. As several others have pointed out Robert De Niro gave what I feel to be one of his best performances. ANd he was matched by the rest of the cast. I especially enjoyed Vittorio Gassman as King Benny. He makes you almost love the mobster, if he were on your side. And this Brad Pitt was a great deal more understated as Michael than he has turned out to be in later films. I for one also had no problems with the voice over narrations, otherwise the film might have taken four hours. And did anyone notice the subtle undertones of the sound score by the master film composer John Williams. How does he do it. I own well over a thousand films and I think he has written the score for about half of them. This is a film not to miss though.
