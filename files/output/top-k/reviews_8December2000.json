Now it is shown on a couple of different networks quite frequently. This is a wonderful film for the whole family. Who wouldn't want to take a journey to the magical land of Oz?I think that it is terrific how well this movie has held up over the years. It's going on sixty-two years since it was first released and yet, it is timeless. It is great to look back on a film that was made in the thirties, and compare it to the movies made in this day and age. This is a film that will just be something that stays around forever. The Wizard of Oz is enjoyable for people of all ages. Everything about it brings a smile to my face. Wouldn't it be wonderful to just magically be transported to a land of talking trees and little munchkins? Of course it would be. The flying monkeys, a talking lion, the astounding ruby slippers, and everything else adds a special kind of magic to the screen.The atmosphere and setting is magnificent. This is one of the things that makes the film so stunning. Anyway, the forest, the witch's castle, and even the farm is really well laid out.I don't think that the casting could have been done any better. Judy Garland shines as the innocent Kansas girl. Her dancing and singing just brightens the whole story up. The lion, tin man, and scarecrow perform amazingly also. Everyone involved down to the littlest munchkin acts so well.Even though this is a movie for everyone, it is categorized as a children's flick. The writing is good with very simple lines and problems, but slightly complex so we're not falling asleep of boredom. What's left to say? Other things like the wardrobe, special effects, musical talents, and even the famous yellow brick road, are so well put together. Oz gives us an idea of what an almost perfect world would be like. No matter how old this movie becomes and we still look back on it, we'll still be able to enjoy at least one thoughtful movie. Classics never die. (Hence the name.)

After all, this has been playing the festival circuit to much praise as well as trophy acquisition.  The hype surrounding this flick has been unavoidable and would serve to show that this film should indeed be the masterpiece that it's been cranked up to be.Unfortunately, Crouching ends up being a passable film that is quite disappointing on a lot of levels.  While the basic storyline seems to invoke some fun melodrama, diehard martial arts fans will be saddened to see that the fighting scenes are poorly rendered and made unrealistic beyond recognition.  Character development is rather limited and the audience can pretty much determine things from their basic understandings of movies. This is really not the film that it should've been.Basically the story breaks like this.  Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat) has to return a famous sword called the Green Destiny to his master.  He has his friend and secret crush, Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) take care of this for him.  There's also a young woman, Jen (Zhang Ziyi) who is engaged in an arranged marriage and ends up having an affair with an outlaw, Lo (Chang Chen).  Since the sword obviously gets stolen, all these characters end up entwined in some way.The thing that has caught many critics' attentions with this film are the action sequences.  I'm saddened to report that for martial arts fans, this will be a major sore spot.  The filmmakers elected to overuse wires to lift the actors around and have also blended in some digital effects from the Romeo Must Die school of filmmaking.  I love wire stuff as much as the next fella (check out Jet Li's classic, Once Upon A Time In China for great usage of this), but this is ridiculous.  All suspension of disbelief is gone once you see these actors fly over the rooftops for long periods of time with minimal effort.  This is not just leaping (which would've made more sense).  Actual lift-off.  Plus, much of the editing distracts from the hand-to-hand combat scenes and this makes it even more obvious to an audience that it never really is that intricate and exciting.  With the minimal impact that these characters have when fighting, it looks more like an art exhibition than a true martial arts film.  This is the film's biggest debit.Next up is something that not many people will notice the widely varying accents of the actors speaking Mandarin.  Yeoh and Chang seem to have the worst ones and this automatically disqualifies us from believing that the film is set in the early 19th century.  True, this shouldn't be a big deal, but it really becomes distracting as 2\/3 of all dialogue seems to have been relooped in post-production, sometimes mid-sentence!  I admire the actors' attempts to get their Mandarin in check (as it certainly isn't easy), esp. Chow Yun-Fat's proper diction (even though just about all his lines are redubbed).  Again, this doesn't affect the majority of viewers.  For those who will notice, this REALLY diverts from their appreciation of the film.So, what really works in Crouching?  Peter Pau's sumptuous cinematography captures the atmosphere of the setting quite well and it's also fun to see Beijing rendered digitally a la Phantom Menace.  The ripe melodrama between the couples is also well-established.  Their situations are rendered in an overwrought fashion that leads to some unintentional laughter.  All that level, the film does succeed and we do see the actors giving what they can to their performances (even with the dialect problem).It's a shame here that the director is Ang Lee, esp. since the guy is a master at films in different genres and settings (Wedding Banquet, Sense & Sensibility, Ice Storm).  He is truly a brilliant filmmaker, but I think we've found his weakness.  He understands the importance of cultural differences and generation gaps (as well as showing scenes of people eating, something greatly lacking in this film!).  With Crouching, most of those elements aren't necessary b\/c of its sole location.  He has, on the other hand, correctly rendered the feeling of the pulp novels on which this is based in a grand fashion.  Maybe Crouching would've been better if there were no martial arts at all.  However, the tone of the film keeps shifting. What style is he trying to accomplish here?  One second it's an arty Mainland Chinese epic (in the Zhang Yimou vein of Raise The Red Lantern), the next second an HK B-movie actioner, then a modern Taiwanese soap opera? These elements are too diverse to try and combine successfully in one narrative.So Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon may become the arthouse hit that it's destined to be due to curiosity and hype.  My hope is that those piqued viewers interested in seeing better martial arts epics will come away from this experience in a renting mood.  Go out and try locating the classic 70's Taiwanese martial arts flicks by the underappreciated auteur, King Hu.  Or even any old Jet Li\/Jackie Chan\/Sammo Hung\/Yuen Biao flick will do the trick.  Those martial arts films indeed have the sheer visceral thrills that Crouching seems to have forgotten completely to accomplish.

This is the film's biggest debit.Next up is something that not many people will notice the widely varying accents of the actors speaking Mandarin.  Yeoh and Chang seem to have the worst ones and this automatically disqualifies us from believing that the film is set in the early 19th century.  True, this shouldn't be a big deal, but it really becomes distracting as 2\/3 of all dialogue seems to have been relooped in post-production, sometimes mid-sentence!  I admire the actors' attempts to get their Mandarin in check (as it certainly isn't easy), esp. Chow Yun-Fat's proper diction (even though just about all his lines are redubbed).  Again, this doesn't affect the majority of viewers.  For those who will notice, this REALLY diverts from their appreciation of the film.So, what really works in Crouching?  Peter Pau's sumptuous cinematography captures the atmosphere of the setting quite well and it's also fun to see Beijing rendered digitally a la Phantom Menace.  The ripe melodrama between the couples is also well-established.  Their situations are rendered in an overwrought fashion that leads to some unintentional laughter.  All that level, the film does succeed and we do see the actors giving what they can to their performances (even with the dialect problem).It's a shame here that the director is Ang Lee, esp. since the guy is a master at films in different genres and settings (Wedding Banquet, Sense & Sensibility, Ice Storm).  He is truly a brilliant filmmaker, but I think we've found his weakness.  He understands the importance of cultural differences and generation gaps (as well as showing scenes of people eating, something greatly lacking in this film!).  With Crouching, most of those elements aren't necessary b\/c of its sole location.  He has, on the other hand, correctly rendered the feeling of the pulp novels on which this is based in a grand fashion.  Maybe Crouching would've been better if there were no martial arts at all.  However, the tone of the film keeps shifting. What style is he trying to accomplish here?  One second it's an arty Mainland Chinese epic (in the Zhang Yimou vein of Raise The Red Lantern), the next second an HK B-movie actioner, then a modern Taiwanese soap opera? These elements are too diverse to try and combine successfully in one narrative.So Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon may become the arthouse hit that it's destined to be due to curiosity and hype.  My hope is that those piqued viewers interested in seeing better martial arts epics will come away from this experience in a renting mood.  Go out and try locating the classic 70's Taiwanese martial arts flicks by the underappreciated auteur, King Hu.  Or even any old Jet Li\/Jackie Chan\/Sammo Hung\/Yuen Biao flick will do the trick.  Those martial arts films indeed have the sheer visceral thrills that Crouching seems to have forgotten completely to accomplish.  ","genre":"Action, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"8 December 2000","score":"","review":"  Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is one of those movies that come to our shores with much pre-release hype.  After all, this has been playing the festival circuit to much praise as well as trophy acquisition.  The hype surrounding this flick has been unavoidable and would serve to show that this film should indeed be the masterpiece that it's been cranked up to be.Unfortunately, Crouching ends up being a passable film that is quite disappointing on a lot of levels.  While the basic storyline seems to invoke some fun melodrama, diehard martial arts fans will be saddened to see that the fighting scenes are poorly rendered and made unrealistic beyond recognition.  Character development is rather limited and the audience can pretty much determine things from their basic understandings of movies. This is really not the film that it should've been.Basically the story breaks like this.  Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat) has to return a famous sword called the Green Destiny to his master.  He has his friend and secret crush, Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) take care of this for him.  There's also a young woman, Jen (Zhang Ziyi) who is engaged in an arranged marriage and ends up having an affair with an outlaw, Lo (Chang Chen).  Since the sword obviously gets stolen, all these characters end up entwined in some way.The thing that has caught many critics' attentions with this film are the action sequences.  I'm saddened to report that for martial arts fans, this will be a major sore spot.  The filmmakers elected to overuse wires to lift the actors around and have also blended in some digital effects from the Romeo Must Die school of filmmaking.  I love wire stuff as much as the next fella (check out Jet Li's classic, Once Upon A Time In China for great usage of this), but this is ridiculous.  All suspension of disbelief is gone once you see these actors fly over the rooftops for long periods of time with minimal effort.  This is not just leaping (which would've made more sense).

Everyone my age did.  Everybody feel in love with it. It was truly the first and only movie that everyone loved.  Young and old.  Male and Female.  Democrat and Republican (GO BUSH!).  However, many people in my grade growing up seemed to out grow it.  It's sad really, many people my age think of Star Wars as a kids thing.  And a lot of it is.  The toys make it appear to be childish.  But the Star Wars movie (I consider all 3 originals to be one movie)  Were spectacular, no matter who you were. So, I don't think it is necessary to say that I had high hopes for the prequel.Well, their is a good side to Episode one and a bad side to it, a dark side and a Jedi side.  I'll start with the positive side.The fun of Star Wars is here.  The special effects are beautiful and glorious.  They are truly breathtaking.  My favorite feature of the movie is the music.  John Williams is a genius, period.  No discussion.  He just is. His music is SO emotional and beautiful.  Many of the movie's scenes will make you feel like a kid again.  The lightsaber battles are brilliant.  The sound is worthy of an Oscar.  I mean, that pod racing scene is spectacular! So far, I think I have established that the movie is gorgeous and fun to watch.Well, on to the bad.  Number 1  Characters.  I haven't seen characters this poorly done in a long, long time.  Even truly bad, un-fun movies have better characterization than this.  A lot of it is truly sad.  Obi-Wan is the biggest let-down.  We don't get to know him, at all.  There is no characterization for him.  I was wondering what the hell George Lucas was thinking!  How can you just forget to give at least SOME depth to one of the most important characters!  I mean, I don't care how much money you have, that is just wrong!  Forshame Mr. Lucas!Number 2 Bad acting.  Don't get me wrong, not all of the acting is bad. Natalie Portman gives a great performance; in fact the best of the movie. Who ever plays the future emperor Palpitine is also great.  But one person, one little boy, take all of that away.  Of course I am talking about the kid who plays Anikan Darth Vader Skywalker.  That kid is terrible.  I heard that Lucas was going to use the kid who appeared at the beginning of ALMOST FAMOUS, who has some great acting ability.  But, Mr. Lucas decided to go with this kid because he is more cute looking.Well, there is more acting problems.  Not much more, but some little tid-bits.  Liam Nelson is okay.  It ain't great, but at least it's better than that half-assed job he did on THE HAUNTING.  Ehhhhhhh.  It hurts to think of that movie.  The Obi-Wan guy never gets a chance to act, so no comment on him.  Samuel L. Jackson (the greatest actor under 50) is wasted. COMMON SAM!!!!!!  Ah, I was so made to see him not being used.  Now, Ray Park is also wasted.  that was the guy who played Darth Maul.  I think the man is a good actor.  He has never been given a good role, but he is going up in Hollywood, instead of the opposite direction, he only speaks a few times, which is sad.I wish that they had made this movie at least an hour longer for more TALKING!!!  Why do these big time, hotshot directors who love pretty special effects have this pet peeve against talking!!  It is not a bad thing!!  It actually can be highly entertaining!Eh hem, now that I'm calm, on to Number 3  the OVERUSE of special effects. Obviously, this idea of OVERUSE never entered Mr. Lucas's mind.  The CG scenes are great, don't get me wrong.  I think the movie is beautiful.  But some things in this movie just seem to be there for no reason other than to look nice.  Like those shields.  Okay, starfighters have shields.  Okay, I can live with that.  But swamp people?  I know they built their technology around force fields (those air bubble cities) but common, this is too much. And the whole Going through the planet's core.  In a word UNESSECARY. Oh, and Jar Jar Binks should be killed in Episode 2.  I don't care if that is unnecessary, the people want that thing dead so Mr. Lucas, to make the people happy, KILL HIM PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Lastly, Number 4  Targeting.  This truly upsets me over all the other bad points.  The other Star Wars movies were made for everyone.  There was NO target audience.  You hear me zero, not there, didn't exist.  This movie does have a target CHILDREN!  This movie is so obviously targeted at kids that it is ridiculous.  It makes me SOOOOOO MAD!  Well, I'm getting a bit tired, so I think you got the point on that issue.Conclusion  Episode One is a bad movie that is enjoyable.  Everyone SHOULD see this movie at least once.  Hell, why am I saying this?  Of course you've seen it.  Everyone in the freaking country has seen it.  And if you haven't, you obviously haven't seen the other Star Wars movies, and you don't really care either.  Well, I liked the movie.  I know it's bad.  It's bad because the plot is weak, the characters are weak, and Jar Jar is more evil than Janet Reno.  But see the movie.  Do it to appease your inner child.  Have fun for once in your life!

Hell, why am I saying this?  Of course you've seen it.  Everyone in the freaking country has seen it.  And if you haven't, you obviously haven't seen the other Star Wars movies, and you don't really care either.  Well, I liked the movie.  I know it's bad.  It's bad because the plot is weak, the characters are weak, and Jar Jar is more evil than Janet Reno.  But see the movie.  Do it to appease your inner child.  Have fun for once in your life!  Be a kid again!And to quote a great philosopherThat's all I got to say about that.  -  Forrest Gump.

First of all, the original plot in the novel was intriguing enough, albeit a tad dry for a screen adaptation, what with ALL the discussions of extinction, animal behavior and what not.  Even still, Crichton managed to write a captivating story with enough action to make the NOVEL a worthy sequel.  However, how could he have signed his name to this? The movie starts out alright, with the story staying relatively close to the book.  But the discrepancies start to show very early, having taken four of the book's characters and condensing them into two - Eddie Carr (which is an amalgam of the book's Eddie and one of the main characters, Doc Thorne) and Kelly (who is a mix of the two children in the book, neither of which are Malcolm's kids).Granted, some of the scenes from the novel do make a small but passing appearance in the movie - however, some scenes come from the original novel Jurassic Park (such as the opening scene with the girl being attacked by the compys and the scene during one of the T-Rex chases where they hide under a waterfall).  Were Spielberg, et al., really hurting for decent scenes?  Because some of this comes off as mere filler, rather than important plot development (like the first film).

It's not because it's romantic--Casablanca's one of my favorite films, and so are a slew of other romance movies.  It's not because it's cheesy, since I like a lot of those movies too.  And it's not because it has a boring plot, because it's really not boring at all.It's because this movie is utterly unfair towards guys.  There's two major reasons for this firstly, Bill Pullman's character is inhuman.  Secondly, if the genders of the two main characters were switched (i.e., if Meg Ryan played Tom Hanks' role and vice versa), Tom Hanks (the character played by Ryan) would be perceived as a total jerk.  I can't really explain these two things without mentioning spoilers, so if you haven't seen the movie, you should probably skip the rest of this commentary.As for Pullman's character yes, if I had a fiancee in the same situation as Meg Ryan and she wanted to dump me for someone more suitable for her, I'd say ok.  But that's not to say I'd be extremely depressed and p***ed off at how much work I put into this relationship just to have mr. perfect walk by and lose everything.  I would also be at least a little bit disappointed that my fiancee didn't care enough about my own feelings to stay with me.  Pullman's character is expecting to have kids with this woman, and he seems perfectly fine--no, downright enthusiastic--with letting her go marry someone else.  I don't know any guy who would be nearly as consenting about this whole thing as Pullman's character.  Additionaly, this all seems to imply (for me at least) that a heterosexual relationship has nothing to do with the guy's happiness and everything to do with the girl's that the man is the provider of services, and the woman is the customer who has every right to leave if she's dissatisfied.How is this the case?  Well, imagine switching the genders of the two main characters.  Say it was Tom Hanks who was already with a woman he was going to marry, but decided to leave her (or ask her if he could leave her) when he heard this woman (Meg Ryan) on a radio talk show who sounded absolutely perfect for him.  Wouldn't Hanks be perceived as a total jerk who dumped his fiancee for someone else?  Wouldn't he be seen as an insensitive person who cared more about his own feelings and happiness than his fiancee's?  In the actual movie, however, it's Meg Ryan who dumps her fiancee, and since she acts cute and innocent when she does it, she's not perceived as a jerk.So, basically, that's my chief complaint about this film.  Other than that, it's very funny, and I like the acting.  Another thing I didn't like about it, though, is that it's the kind of movie where you're made to only care about the two main characters and nobody else.But ultimately I think that my main complaint about this movie is really a complaint about American dating culture.  It was really hard for me to figure out why I didn't like this movie, and I think that this movie really reveals how disadvantaged the stereotype of men is in dating culture. That's not to say that women aren't disadvantaged--the whole feminist movement is the embodiment of this fact--but all I'm trying to say is that men are also disadvantaged in different ways, and in my opinion dating culture needs to change for the equality of both sexes.

There's two major reasons for this firstly, Bill Pullman's character is inhuman.  Secondly, if the genders of the two main characters were switched (i.e., if Meg Ryan played Tom Hanks' role and vice versa), Tom Hanks (the character played by Ryan) would be perceived as a total jerk.  I can't really explain these two things without mentioning spoilers, so if you haven't seen the movie, you should probably skip the rest of this commentary.As for Pullman's character yes, if I had a fiancee in the same situation as Meg Ryan and she wanted to dump me for someone more suitable for her, I'd say ok.  But that's not to say I'd be extremely depressed and p***ed off at how much work I put into this relationship just to have mr. perfect walk by and lose everything.  I would also be at least a little bit disappointed that my fiancee didn't care enough about my own feelings to stay with me.  Pullman's character is expecting to have kids with this woman, and he seems perfectly fine--no, downright enthusiastic--with letting her go marry someone else.  I don't know any guy who would be nearly as consenting about this whole thing as Pullman's character.  Additionaly, this all seems to imply (for me at least) that a heterosexual relationship has nothing to do with the guy's happiness and everything to do with the girl's that the man is the provider of services, and the woman is the customer who has every right to leave if she's dissatisfied.How is this the case?  Well, imagine switching the genders of the two main characters.  Say it was Tom Hanks who was already with a woman he was going to marry, but decided to leave her (or ask her if he could leave her) when he heard this woman (Meg Ryan) on a radio talk show who sounded absolutely perfect for him.  Wouldn't Hanks be perceived as a total jerk who dumped his fiancee for someone else?  Wouldn't he be seen as an insensitive person who cared more about his own feelings and happiness than his fiancee's?  In the actual movie, however, it's Meg Ryan who dumps her fiancee, and since she acts cute and innocent when she does it, she's not perceived as a jerk.So, basically, that's my chief complaint about this film.  Other than that, it's very funny, and I like the acting.  Another thing I didn't like about it, though, is that it's the kind of movie where you're made to only care about the two main characters and nobody else.But ultimately I think that my main complaint about this movie is really a complaint about American dating culture.  It was really hard for me to figure out why I didn't like this movie, and I think that this movie really reveals how disadvantaged the stereotype of men is in dating culture. That's not to say that women aren't disadvantaged--the whole feminist movement is the embodiment of this fact--but all I'm trying to say is that men are also disadvantaged in different ways, and in my opinion dating culture needs to change for the equality of both sexes.

Why do you think all of the new characters in the sequels are Shodoken fighters, not marines?  2)Street Fighter is a fighting game.
