Fortunately this movie wasn't made by Americans. They could never realize, nor understand this level of cinematography and would turn it into a Pearl Harbor (Oh my!). What makes this movie great, is the way the movie continuously shows what seems  to be a fairy-tale, but what is in fact nothing more but a play. A play played in China, suffering extraordinary changes itself. As Pu Yi mentions himself a theatre without an audience. Left long ago. This movie focuses on a single man, trying to make a change, but fails, for he is nothing but a puppet, controlled by the Japanese, as he for years was a puppet for China. He is eager to be in control, simply in order to make those changes reality, makes him an easy target for the Japanese. He grows up to be served and to be seen as the almighty and cannot hold himself up in New China, where there is no place for an emperor any longer. The only persons that seems to do well in this new environment, is the woman who had in fact even less freedom; Pu yi's second wife. She claims her freedom after being settled in England. Because The Last Emperor focuses on Pu Yi and his relatives, while moving the political issues  to the background, makes this movie so 'uneasy' to look at. There is this wonderful story of a little lad who grows up in an ancient surrounding, but there is always the noise from beyond the walls he doesn't understand. He cannot understand why everything from beyond those walls (his brother paying him a visit now and then, Johnson, his tutor) seems to move on. Within those walls, time seems to stand still and everybody near him appears so eager to keep the 'real' world outside the walls of the Forbidden City. The music makes this movie complete. A movie without good music is half wasted. It matches perfectly with the emotions, time and location. Surely Bertolucci's best movie.

I have seen Carrie and found that film reasonable, if overrated. This film alludes to the said Carrie at one point, and there are similarities; namely with the clique of girls at odds with another girl, though that changes round due to early events.Jawbreaker isn't quite run-of-the-mill, though its character development definitely is. The idea isn't novel, but that isn't to say it can't succeed if the film differs in other ways.  The characters, I hear you ask? Obviously they're all rather well-worn stereotypes. That wouldn't be so much a problem if the film was consistently witty and enjoyable. But, this film undeniably has its longueurs, even with it clocking it at barely eighty minutes. Most glaring is the time wasted with the relationship between Julie and some non-entity who's supposed to be a player.Of the main characters, Rose McGowan's minx, Courtney Alice Shayne, makes the most impression. She proves adept at chewing the scenery, over-playing the prima-bitch role to a degree that amuses. She's quite the card. Plus, of course, she's got the sulky, petulant good looks and pouts on tap. It is clearly a problem that no-one else really makes much of an impression in the film. Rebecca Gayheart is certainly very striking in her looks, and acts passably. Shame it's a boring role. Shame that given Julie's falling out with Courtney, there is only one scene amounting to a bitchy confrontation between them, and it is indeed funny - Courtney - Life'a bitch, then you die; Julie - No, honey. *you're the bitch.*; Courtney - Ooh, so aggressive! It's turning me on...! et al.  Julie Benz really has remarkably little to do or say for a lead, ending up as a mere minion of McGowan. I can't say there was anything much in Judy Greer's character or peformance as either the scant, laughable stereotype Fern or the vapid pretender, Vylette. Pam Grier is in for little reason, other than as a star name, it seems. Manson? Didn't see the feller. A minor point, but certainly noticeable, would be the fact that these supposed high-school dames are played by actresses pushing mid-late twenties in age.The script contains some good dialogue, and also lines that are rather good in an absurd, silly way - It's just weird how time erases things.\/Time doesn't erase things, people erase things\/Yeah, people erase people...; this last line is delivered amusingly by Gayheart, I must admit. The soundtrack? A compendium of soft-metal, neo-rock tracks, largely indistinguishable from each other. The use of Young at Heart, sung by Bing Crosby, at the end, is odd and all the better for it. This final scene is okay, if more than predictable. It's a shame no real spin is put on it, barring a sheen of irony and semi-grand guignol. The film's central problem seems to be one of tone. Playing flippant with such potentially dark subject matter is quite a risk and if not done well enough, the film will falter. But then, the best things about this are the few choice lines and the exaggerated over-playing. Maybe a more fully light-hearted tale would have been a better bet.  Anyway, the film truly is small-fry, and while it could have been much worse, it is largely a failed exercise in trying to do a cool black comedy.

Get it at Amazon.)This quasi-remake of Hitchcock's Dial M for Murder (1954)--which was filmed in 3D, by the way--is a rather good thriller in its own right, intelligently done throughout except for a few scenes near the end when Director Andrew Davis and screenwriter Patrick Smith Kelly lose their judgment and opt for a silly knock down, drag out fight.Michael Douglas plays a quintessential evil kind of guy, evil, ruthless, greedy, two-faced, crafted to excite our loathing ('How's THIS for wet work?'). He is excellent. Gwyneth Paltrow plays his very rich wife who has incredibly poor taste in men. Seems that Gwyneth has become attracted to roles that get her involved with the wrong kind of guys, witness The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999) and Sliding Doors (1998). But she is also very good, as is Viggo Mortensen who plays the murderous con artist.The plot is tight and filled with nice twists. The sets are opulent and dripping with money, and neither the direction nor the camera work calls undue attention to itself. But what really makes this fly is the material on which it is based, the devilishly clever play by Frederick Knott, who reigned on Broadway many years ago. I'll bet that Paltrow was persuaded in part to take the role because the same part was played in the Hitchcock movie by the legendary Grace Kelly. Also, another Frederick Knott play made into a movie was Wait Until Dark (1967) starring the also legendary Audrey Hepburn. I suspect Paltrow could hardly resist joining such illustrious company, especially when the plot here allows her to take matters into her own hands, as it were, and give to her two guys considerably more than she gets.Bottom line you will be diverted.

In this second slice of Corleone murder, intrigue and family ties, one misses Brando for about five minutes, and then Pacino takes the screen in what must surely be the finest piece of acting he has ever done. An Oscar for Scent Of A Woman? Typical blindness on the part of Academy voters, because Pacino blows everyone else away with just a look of hatred and coldness from his eyes, and by the way he reacts on the screen. By the end of the film he looks like a 20th century Richard III, complete with a blood-red shirt and a pale, almost lifeless face. Coppola, already scoring points that year for his excellent conspiracy drama, The Conversation, delivers what is, in my opinion, the best ever film made between the years 1970- 1979. In short, from start to finish, this film is totally mesmerising. DeNiro steps into Brando's shoes as the younger Don in a wonderfully evocative recreation of New York in the early part of the century, and yet come his last scene you will have no problem in believing that this will be the man who, in twenty years time, would grow up to be Marlon Brando in The Godfather. Twenty-eight years of meatier gangster flicks (Goodfellas, Once Upon A Time In America) have failed to erode its power and undeniable genius. This is because The Godfather part two is like every other classic work of cinematic art - it never ages and its power will never fade. Alas, a third part helped to remove some of its shine, but only a tiny part. A third chapter wasn't really nessecary - The story of Michael Corleone ends right there - on Lake Tahoe.Movies like this come round once every decade, so do yourselves all a big favour and sit down for 200 minutes and indulge in a brilliant movie experience.

Here a naturalist formula works due to economical pacing and the willingness of the lead to push himself in physically demanding scenes throughout. Ultimately however the picture succeeds in making its anti-war statement without becoming stuck in sentimentality (see BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES), and as such excels further by making valuable comments about displacement and alienation without losing an objective viewpoint. The combination of a well-translated message within a commercial action picture makes for a composed yet entertaining picture.The small town forest setting of Hope works in its representation of a greater US misunderstanding and hostility towards its own Vietnam veterans.

The blame for this rests squarely with the establishment, as it is the law that instigates the animosity and is thus the target of retribution (the one death being an unprofessional cop). Overall the low-key realism offsets the normal tendency of action films to negate location as merely a playground of destruction, and rather showcase overblown characters and pyrotechnics. Not to suggest that over the top action with pulp dialogue and big guns doesn't hold merit (see PREDATOR). Rather the weight of this picture is not compromised by an excessive depiction of weapons or cartoonish dialogue and as such retains a balanced naturalistic result (there is enough violence, explosions and machinery to satisfy).The economical pacing provides for no gaps where time lags.

The period between Stallone's leap from a rock face to his ambush of the police force is especially memorable.

The scene is efficient in highlighting the US as ill prepared for combat both at home and abroad. The intermissions between Crenna and Dennehy, do not fail to please by either stressing the need for a revision of understanding concerning veterans, or by entertaining and keeping the picture grounded as an action film with imaginatively bombastic dialogue.The pain of war, that of the alienated individual (veteran) or of a country coming to terms with assimilating its displaced soldiers (town), is conveyed physically. The body is abused throughout the film and minimal attention is given to the mental hardships of coming to terms with war and its consequences (see BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY). Emotional weight, in the form of searching dialogue, which may have offset the action, is only delivered at the end in a cathartic speech. The effect of omitting heavy dialogue and relying on action to convey the effects of war avoids any danger of the picture becoming stuck in mawkish drama (see COMING HOME).

The film delivers a strong core message on the effects displacement and assimilation. It maintains a subversive element with its anti establishment views and questions what the establishment was doing to help.

Stallone's final speech is in line with the ambitions of the film by succinctly outlining themes of alienation, mistrust of the establishment and hopelessness.The appeal of FIRST BLOOD is its ability to satisfy on many levels despite being primarily an action picture. The film delivers a strong core message on the effects displacement and assimilation. It maintains a subversive element with its anti establishment views and questions what the establishment was doing to help. Indeed the film can be viewed as a western with its themes of civilization, order, alienation, and violence that are prevalent in the genre. The destruction of the community and its values are needed to highlight the war at home. There are even noirish elements suggested by its somber mood (rain, dark), fatalistic composition (his last friend killed by cancer from agent orange) and the soldiers existential crisis upon returning home.It is credible that the film raises these issues economically and still retains freshness as an action item. A critique of a similar film, THE DEER HUNTER, which although being far grater in scale and scope, fails regularly in its attempt to convey the ambiguity of veterans (traditionally heroes) returning from a questionable war. It contains too many maudlin sequences that fail in their awkwardness (the transparency of trying to emote pathos best seen in the portentous ending). I rather prefer the dry delivery of pulp hyperbole in reply to the issue of sending troops to capture Rambo (the reference being to the commitment of troops to Vietnam and the difficulty of repatriation of veterans)'You send in that many don't forget one thing' 'What?' 'A good supply of body bags!'

Although there have been many comedies set at and around college, Orange County is the first that I know of to focus on the circumstances surrounding a horribly misguided application to Stanford University.  Though the film's not really worth seeing more than once, there are some inspired supporting performances that lead to some funny moments.What drove me to see this movie was Jack Black (OK, technically my best friend drove me to see the movie but I wanted to see it because of Jack Black), and even though he was quite unflattering (to say the least) in his underwear (he does spend a rather disturbing amount of screen time half-naked), he had some great lines and simple, but funny physical comedy. As always, he's great as an arrogant, stupid, but loyal deadbeat\/criminal fool with good intentions, this time being to help his younger brother get into Stanford, which rejected him after being sent the wrong transcript. Though Black was pretty funny, the best performance was from Catherine O'Hara, who is hilarious as a neurotic, alcoholic mother who doesn't want her college-bound son (played satisfactorily with a bit of overacting by Colin Hanks) to leave the nest.  The ultimate overexaggeration of everything my own parents tell me (for the record, I'm graduating from high school this year), I couldn't help but burst out laughing at her every line.Though these two supporting performances (although receiving top billing, Black wasn't in the film as much as I expected) are the main reason to see the film, there is some excellent writing and sly wit in the non-slapstick sequences as well (though not as much as I would've liked); for those who live in the area, there are lots of home-grown in-jokes (since I live in Northern California, I only got a couple, but from what I've heard there are quite a few).  An unexpected appearance by John Lithgow as the harsh rich father who wants his son to inherit the business, not go off to Stanford and study writing, and a really funny cameo by writer Mike White (or, as I knew him, Buck from Chuck & Buck) as a valley English teacher are additional reasons to enjoy the film.Unfortunately, though there were more parts than I expected that were really funny, just as much of the film isn't that funny.  It's better than typical teen fare, but not by much (references to two of the younger brother's apparent homosexuality, for example, don't work).  Also, although the film focuses on the younger brother, the most interesting characters are the supporting ones; Colin Hanks, as mentioned earlier, overacts a little bit, and Schuyler Fisk, as his girlfriend, is similarly unremarkable. Finally, the turnaround at the ending is, while heartwarming in a twisted way, a bit of a let-down, all the more so because it seemed like there was no other way to end the movie.  That being said though, its still the 2nd best movie MTV has ever backed (but did they really have to put in so many references to that Butterfly song to sell the soundtrack?).

And it's appeal has never been so obvious- Character frailty, heroism, a powerful love story, resonant acting and writing and despite all the backlash from critics and purists regarding it's sexual ambiguity, something Blockbuster can carry. Remember American Beauty, in comparison, had subtle references too (actually to me they were blatant, but hey this is a general forum) and it still snagged the big statue.Which leaves me to Russell Crowe, whose performance in The Insider was as close to perfect as an actor can get (He 'vus robbed!). Of course, the voters knew their mistake (although it took him a year- see Gladiator- to get it right). To the film Crowe's versatility simply baffles me here, once again, reaching deep within who knows where to become the math genius and Nobel Prize- winning John Nash. His preparation has to be extremely unique to continually put forth this much passion into each role. I'd love to know what he does- anyone?The film doesn't work, though, without Jennifer Connelly. As Nash's wife, she provides a potent chemistry with Crowe and an energetic calm that slowly creeps up on you. Not sure how, but I swear she steals some scenes away from Russy- but that's real, real chemistry folks, not the Meg Ryan-Tom Hanks kind.

Of course, he's working with talented actors who helped drive the films dramatic and emotional ranges. and a solid script. or should I say book. I'm not completely sold on Howard as a great director.
