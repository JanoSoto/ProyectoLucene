The story revolves around five girls at an all girls prep school, four of which have the IQ's of one of Tiger Woods better rounds of golf.  As usual in these movies, we are treated to the escapades and mischief cooked up by bored teens, this time female style.  Unfortunately, most of the skits were woefully unfunny and stereotyped.    As the movie progresses, we learn that, out of financial need, the school intends to merge with a local boys' school and go coed.  The girls try to sabotage the plan with a plot at the next mixer to make the boys look like drunks and perverts.  When that fails, the film starts taking itself very seriously and the girls organize a student strike and lock themselves in the dorm demanding the right to vote against the merger.The direction of this film by writer\/director Sarah Kernochan was uninspiring.  Other than some decent sixties props it was pretty insipid.  Kernochan made a splash as the co-writer of &#145;9 ½ Weeks' and &#145;Sommersby', but as a solo writer\/director she just doesn't cut it.  The acting; well, there really wasn't any acting.  Other than Lynn Redgrave, who was far too melodramatic for this film, all we had here was a bunch of pubescent teens behaving sillily.  The only serious teenage character in the film was Odette (Gaby Hoffman) and she was far too dour and condescending.This movie is pretty much a disaster.  It had a couple of funny moments but they were far too sparse.  I gave it a 3\/10.  I would only recommend it to girls 10 to 18 years old, or to anyone else who needs a 90 minute nap.

Not only does Francis Ford Coppola's dazzling direction realistically portray the atmosphere of Vietnam, but this film above all is very cerebral and profound, qualities that the vast majority of war movies lack.  Instead of the constant and often monotonous war action scenes depicted in films like Saving Private Ryan, Apocalypse Now strives to utilize these scenes as a backdrop for the engaging and complex characters that are of much greater importance to the film.  The two most significant characters of the movie are played by Martin Sheen and Marlon Brando.  Sheen plays a Vietnam war captain who has been ordered by the military to kill Brando, a former colonel who has strayed from the military's commands and has formed his own band of warriors in Cambodia.  Also, Robert Duvall turns in a brilliant performance as an American general in Vietnam who seems oblivious to the effects of the war and more interested in having fun than seriously fighting the war.  Besides these main characters, the rest of the film's personas do not critically influence the movie.  However, all of them serve to underscore the chaotic and almost insane nature of American involvement in Vietnam, which seems to be the underlying message that Coppola and co-writer John Milius attempt to convey.  Much of the brilliance of this movie can be attributed to its many ironies, such as how the military branded Brando as a lunatic, although it was the military who played a large role in influencing his condition.  However, the greatest irony of all in the movie lies in its conclusion.  This atmosphere of recklessness is also very important to Sheen's character because it shows him to be a man of contempt for the military's actions and policies in Vietnam but simultaneously a man who is indifferent to them.  His persona is still more complex because he in a way wants to stay in Vietnam despite its horrors because he has no one back home who cares for him anymore.  But probably the most complicated character is Brando's, as he attributes his ruthlessness to the deception of the military of unfairly judging their enemies as well as themselves in the war.  Apocalypse Now gives an extremely radical perspective of the Vietnam War, but in my opinion, the film comments more on the nature of war in general.  It demonstrates how the different conceptions of morality and compassion in a war setting can change the individual that seriously ponders them.  Four stars out of four.

Well, I finally saw the Matrix.  The way to describe it was that I expected to love it and give it a 10, but I only give it a 7.First, some of the good things.  The action and much of the special effects really are great.  The sequences at the end are incredible.  Laurence Fishburne and Carrie Anne Moss looked really cool in their outfits.Now, some of the bad things.  I don't remember thinking that Keanu Reeves was so bad in say, Speed.  But here, he's just not very good.  He sure looks cool in the black attire and in the action sequences and all, but in the scenes where he has much dialogue, he's just not very good.  Actually, my biggest complaint is something that judging from other people's comments, I am in the minority on.  I'm talking about the villains.  Were they meant to be seen as sinister or funny?  I found them to be neither.  I found Agent Smith to be highly annoying.  The way he talked just grated on me.  And, I swear, I fully expected the MIB team of Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones to come out and tell someone to look at their little light.  The other two agents were even worse.  The part where all the bullets stop before hitting Neo at the end and the three agents simultaneously lower the guns was so ridiculous.  The lowering of the guns made it look like a farce of a movie. Was it mean to be seen like that?  One other little complaint and I have to apologize for this one.  During the interrogation scene when they put the bug or whatever in Neo, they call him a program writer.  Please.  If they are going to portray someone in the software engineering profession, they should have asked someone who knows about it.  It looks like they should have asked one of those many computer people who worked on the movie to look over the script.  I know it is a tiny complaint, but when you have been doing that kind of work for several years like I have, calling it program writer sounds highly, highly hokey.But, overall, the movie is pretty cool.
