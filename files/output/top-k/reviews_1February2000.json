This film is almost flawless &#150; I say almost because beauty is never perfect, but this comes pretty close. It's about the search for beauty amid modern dreariness, and how we tend to look in all the wrong places. But it can't be summed up in one line. It's a film made up of stunning formal elements &#150; beautifully photographed, great characters, and a tight script that never flags despite the length. And magnificent acting. It's a nice example of how craft and art can combine to produce something more than the sum of its parts.American Beauty borrows heavily from other arthouse films of the past &#150; most notably Ang Lee's Ice Storm &#150; especially in its style and characterisations, and if you've seen Ice Storm you can't miss the influence &#150; and it's just as good if not better. It's a celebration of life as well as a heavy critique of modern lives and values. This is a team effort and everybody pulls together. Kevin Spacey is wonderful &#150; he just leaves you wanting more. His minimalist style just suits this part &#150; you need to probe beneath the surface, which is exactly what the film is about. Thora Birch as the confused daughter and Wes Bentley as her boyfriend with the secret of life are sensitive and subtle with their roles. The only jarring note &#150; the flaw in this beauty &#150; is the curiously shallow character of Caroline portrayed by Annette Bening. Compared to the rich complexity of the other characters, Caroline is flat and predictable. We never discover what really makes her tick or how she lost her joylessness. She's just there to be a vehicle for her husband and daughter, which is a puzzle. She has none of the depths that Mary Tyler Moore's character played in Ordinary People, for example. Perhaps Sam Mendes wasn't particularly interested in the character. But it doesn't matter too much as the film is so good it can take a few sour notes. This is a film I could watch again and again &#150; and I can't wait &#150; and still find more depths to plumb and more issues to think about without feeling I've been lectured about life, which so many other heavy-handed Hollywood directors do to their captive audiences. A light hand on the reins, as Sam Mendes has here, can produce a far better result. 8.5 out of 10.

Focusing world attention upon the region through the media has occasionally had the positive effect of raising awareness of the conflicts through art. The work of artists from former Yugoslavia has found an appreciation that has never really existed before, partly due to the fact that they are the most fit to interpret the events there. The republic of Macedonia is certainly experiencing its share of strife.Nestled in between the countries of Serbia, Bulgaria, Greece, and Albania, it is surrounded by strained relations on all sides, countries that have refused to recognize its autonomy for a long time. A significant Albanian Moslem minority feuds with the dominant Orthodox Christian Slav population. Hardly a week passes without a new arms network running from Alabania to Macedonia being discovered. Despite the presence of U.N. peacekeeping forces, armed skirmishes ravage the countryside.Milcho Manchevski left his native Macedonia to pursue a college education in the U.S. He studied film at Southern Illinois University. Upon graduating, he moved to New York and began working on commercial, experimental films, and music videos. BEFORE THE RAIN is his first full-length feature, for which he returned to his native country to make. He was able to secure British and French financing with his creative, authoritative and topical screenplay. An inspiring tale about the senselessness of war and the fragility of humans and their loves, the film is, despite some minute flaws, one of the most  passionate and  sublime cinematic statements of the '90s.It has an intriguing, if not wholly original non-linear narrative structure. Through three episodes titled, Words, Faces, and Pictures, respectively, the viewer is introduced to three characters whose lives interconnect from minute to strongly significant ways.Kiril (Gregoire Collin, of OLIVIER, OLIVIER) is a young novice in an Orthodox monastery who cannot help but hide Zamira (Labina Mitevska), a fugitive Albanian girl, from the villagers who want to execute her for murdering a shepherd. He does it out of the goodness of his heart, but perhaps also out of the beginnings of a lustful affection for her. They flee north in an attempt to find Kiril's uncle in Skopje, and meet with dire hardship and tragedy.Meanwhile, in England, Anne (Katrin Kartlidge, most familiar as the lisping goth girl from Mike Leigh's film NAKED), a photo editor is in the midst of a personal crisis. She is becoming more and more disaffected with her husband Nick (Jay Villiers) while experiencing a difficult, confused relationship with her lover, Aleksandar (Rade Serbedzija), an award-winning native Macedonian photographer. Unsure of what to do, she distances herself from both men, but cannot stem the tide of the turbulent events all around her. The story dispenses with her husband in somewhat contrived way, and she ends up trying to find Aleksandar, who has since left for Macedonia.Aleksandar returns to his native village, only to find that the overall climate has radically changed, and the simple life he tries to rediscover has since been made more complex by the feuds with the Albanians. His return is met with mixed reactions from warm welcomes from his close friends, to cold-shouldering by the newly-armed local anti-Albanian faction, to outright hatred from some of the Albanians. When his childhood love from a neighboring village seeks his aid to help protect her daughter, Aleksandar is thrust into the heart of the conflict, and his refusal to takes sides has tragic repercussions. Serbedzija interprets the role with a noble, morally centered sense of confidence. One of former Yugoslavia's most well known and respected actors Serbedzija found his role to be a way of protesting the conflicts in his region-As an artist, as someone well-known, I had to speak out against nationalism and war. As Aleksandar was presumed to take sides, so was I. It's my story. What ends up happening to Aleksandar, when cousins take arms against cousins, has happened to many in former Yugoslavia and it could happen to me.With its non-linear structure, the time-line of the film is somewhat incoherent, and there are some plot developments in the middle segment, occurring in England, which are a bit too pat. These are balanced by the striking, somewhat exotic visuals and original, exhilarating neo-ethnic music by a group called Anastasia, fine acting (especially by Collin and Serbedzija), and an overall poignant sense of the waste of war, even a war in its beginnings. Manchevski illuminates his use of the film's title-There was this sense of something heavy beginning to happen, something looming in the air. At the same time life was continuing as before. This story doesn't deal with the political aspects of how wars start. It's about human passion and how it can lead one in different, unexpected directions. It's about how a war somewhere in the world might get started and how that can affect your life regardless of where you are. Ultimately, it's about taking sides.

Despite this, the characters were portrayed very well, and you could really notice the distinctions between them, and which characters you were likely to prefer. However one drawback to the characters was how obvious it was to spot who was going to bite it - all my sister had to do was look at the characters in a group and guess straight away.On the whole though, I found it to be a good horror film, done proud by the talents of writer Kevin Williamson and of the cast. If you are looking for a good scare, or simply taste other films after experiencing the wonder that is Scream, then IKWYDLS should be your first choice - with its many 'jumps' making you enjoy the ride all the way!ENJOY, and most importantly, SCREAM ON!!! ","genre":"Horror, Mystery"},{"date":"1 February 2000","score":"","review":"  This film got very mixed reviews when it was released - I saw some critics give it the highest marks while others trashed it as, in their opinions, one of the worst films of the year.  I personally agree with the critics who liked this film and think its the best movie ever made about the Vikings (although there, unfortunately, aren't many other Viking films for comparison) and I think it will grow in popularity over time like other unique films that initially failed with critics and at the box office (like Blade Runner).  This is a pure testosterone movie that tells, through the eyes of an Arabian poet, the story of Vikings fighting against a mysterious and cannibalistic tribe.  Based on an older Michael Crichton novel called The Eaters of the Dead, this movie takes itself seriously - no wisecracking sidekicks or other dumb movie cliches are to be found here (which, inexplicably, was something the critics who hated the movie complained about - I guess they prefer every action\/adventure movie to be campy and tongue-in-cheek like Congo or The Mummy).  And, by taking itself seriously, the nobility of the Vikings and their code of honor comes through strongly by the end of the film.  If I had to criticize anything in the film, its that the battle scenes are too dark and hard-to-see.  While I greatly admire naturally-lit films, and these scenes do capture what a fight in the dark of night without artificial lighting would be like, I think they should have bend a bit towards standard movie convention and used more lighting in these scenes.  Still, despite that complaint, this is the best action film of 1999 and it is definitely worth a look (8\/10 stars).
