We see Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is now confined to a mental asylum. But it's not to long until good ole Michael Myers (Brad Loree) drops by and knocks her off. This is when the movie slowly descends into the crapper. A group of teens audition to spend a night in the Myers' house courtesy of Dangertainment. Alas, it all goes terribly wrong as Mikey pays them a visit.I'll start by saying, if the movie had been edited to only include the first 10 minutes, it would have been better than this 90 min pile of crap. Busta Rhymes gives possibly the worst performance in history and the rest of the cast are only a cut above him. The script is poorly written and the characters were not interesting. The score was generic and not the least bit scary. Brad Loree does play a good Michael though, and surprisingly he was the best actor (bar Curtis).Usually I'm OK for some mindless slasher entertainment but when its this bad, I just can't hack it.1\/5.

All I can say is, don't believe the hype. I challenge anyone who likes this movie to ask themselves why? I think I was abducted by aliens while watching this movie because I swear the whole thing was over but I don't remember any of it and I'm not even on drugs. Maybe that's the problem. People really need to start being objective in their reviews. What I mean is, forget the cliques you belong to, the image you try and live by, forget what you envy or know about the directors\/actors and just look at the movie for what it is. In this case, not too good. This is what I got out of it. The people responsible for creating this trash hated women. There are three women in this movie and they all ended up being possessed, raped and beaten\/horrifically dismembered. There are 2 men. One is the hero (Bruce Cambell, who I guess is some sort of cult movie super hero) and one dies rather quietly without much attention. First woman goes into the woods and is raped by the forest... or a tree... or something not sure but there are roots involved. They show her in agony, screaming, etc. They show a root going up her leg and under her night gown... you know where... They show her cupping her breast as a root tries to remove her hand, then low and behold, they show her naked breast. *gasps* After she is all scratched up and bleeding from the incident she runs back into the cabin... from this point everyone else but the one male hero gets possessed by demons and it's just one giant gore fest from here.If you hate people, you will like this movie. If you are a nerd, and were dumped by a girl, and are developing a serious psychosis towards woman, you will like this movie. You will probably like Anime too.

Much has been said about Oliver Stone's involvement in the war and how this movie was created of his experiences, but I think it's important to point out that Stone's writing and directing is strong enough that his reputation as a veteran is not the only excuse for the disturbing and disgusting images of a film that has upon second-thought no inspection, but contains itself admirably as a parable for the state of American politics at the time. Sure his use of an almost all-black cast for Sgt. Elias' half of the troop and all-white cast (a good few with strong hick accents) for Sgt.

When he catches the publisher trying to steal it, he attacks him, so the publisher's assistant throws acid in the musicians face. He ends up living under the Paris Opera House and demanding that back up singer Christine Dubois be given larger roles. As he begins to murder people and destroy the Opera House, two of Christine's suitors set out to stop the phantom once and for all. This isn't the best version of the story, but it's the version I grew up with, so it is one of my favourite versions of the story.The new version of the story is very good with an interesting new origin for the phantom. This is the first version I saw, so the birth defect origin from the book and original film were a little weird to me. I always thought this version was vastly entertaining, but as I grew older, I started noticing the problems. The movie is too short, or not enough happens. The pacing is all wrong for a horror film. The opera scenes go on for way too long and they take up 70% of the movie. 25% is phantom stuff, and 5% is the subplot with the two suitors vying for Christine. The Phantom isn't as deranged as he could be. I really enjoyed the famous chandelier scene however, because it took the supernatural\/magical aspect away from the phantom and made him more like a man, by showing him use a hacksaw to cut the chain. Another problem I had was the relationship between the phantom and Christine. It was too disjointed, and not as intimate as the other versions.The acting is very good. Claude Rains is great as the shy musician who transforms into a bold maniac. Susanna Foster is good as Christine as well.Overall, the story and great acting make this movie very entertaining, but the excessive music kills it.

Who knows. But either way, everyone should be able to recognize themselves in the actions Paul Kersey takes. Even though its ruthless and violent, you still understand him and cheer for him as well. It distinct this movie from other 'revenge-flicks' and is the very reason why this movie has grown a bit into a Charles Bronson classic.I like how the movie handles its story. It doesn't try to glorify Paul Kersey's actions but it does make them understandable. Yes, the violence is pretty brutal but it all serves a purpose in the movie and becomes necessary for the forming of the character. Basically this movie is just your average action movie revenge flick but with more realism added to it. It helps to make Death Wish an original movie, even though the story and concept itself is far from anything new or original. The story is slowly told and it takes its time to develop. The movie is perhaps even an essential '70's viewing, since its a one of a kind movie, in which a normal every day guy turn into a 'sidewalk vigilante' after his wife is killed and his daughter raped by a couple of thugs (one of them played by a very young Jeff Goldblum in his very first screen appearance).But lets be fair. the movie is far from a perfect one. The movie has a typical experimental like '70's style, especially in its cinematography, that is interesting to watch but it adds very little and works distracting at times. The movie is also told very simple at times and some of the sequences even feel amateur like, to be honest. The story itself also feels extremely far fetched and unlikely. I mean, literally every time Paul Kersey goes outside he walks into trouble. He gets mugged several times and he encounters other thugs on numerous occasions. It's highly unlikely all, even for in a city like New York.The acting on the other hand is good. It's probably mainly thanks to Charles Bronson that his character works so well for the story. I also really liked Vincent Gardenia in his role. He brought some much needed comic relief and gave the story some extra flair and depth.A simple movie that mainly thanks to the original way it handles the story and characters, works out extremely well as a brutal action flick. Even though flawed, still an essential '70's viewing in my opinion.7\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"26 June 2006","score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Would the world be a better place with more persons like Paul Kersey around?

The movie is perhaps even an essential '70's viewing, since its a one of a kind movie, in which a normal every day guy turn into a 'sidewalk vigilante' after his wife is killed and his daughter raped by a couple of thugs (one of them played by a very young Jeff Goldblum in his very first screen appearance).But lets be fair. the movie is far from a perfect one. The movie has a typical experimental like '70's style, especially in its cinematography, that is interesting to watch but it adds very little and works distracting at times. The movie is also told very simple at times and some of the sequences even feel amateur like, to be honest. The story itself also feels extremely far fetched and unlikely. I mean, literally every time Paul Kersey goes outside he walks into trouble. He gets mugged several times and he encounters other thugs on numerous occasions. It's highly unlikely all, even for in a city like New York.The acting on the other hand is good. It's probably mainly thanks to Charles Bronson that his character works so well for the story. I also really liked Vincent Gardenia in his role. He brought some much needed comic relief and gave the story some extra flair and depth.A simple movie that mainly thanks to the original way it handles the story and characters, works out extremely well as a brutal action flick.

Who knows. But either way, everyone should be able to recognize themselves in the actions Paul Kersey takes. Even though its ruthless and violent, you still understand him and cheer for him as well. It distinct this movie from other 'revenge-flicks' and is the very reason why this movie has grown a bit into a Charles Bronson classic.I like how the movie handles its story. It doesn't try to glorify Paul Kersey's actions but it does make them understandable. Yes, the violence is pretty brutal but it all serves a purpose in the movie and becomes necessary for the forming of the character.

I can sum up this movie in one sentence The greatest sci fi film ever made. No need to go into detail, by now just about everyone has seen this movie in one form or another. But it holds one giant disappointment for me. I so looked forward to the year 2001 after seeing this film. I had high hopes for the future and thought for sure we'd have a base on the moon. Instead 2001 turned out to be one of the darkest days in American history. And for that I was sadly disturbed. Hard to believe also that it's nearly 40 years since its release. I keep track of how many times I see a movie. If it's really good I count to 100 and stop counting after that. I have now exceeded 300 times, maybe more, and never grow tired of watching this epic. While Citizen Kane has to be the number one mundane movie of all time, 2001 is the number one sci fi film. Forry Ackerman hated it which doesn't make a bit of sense since he is the foremost fan of science fiction. The late great magazine Castle of Frankenstein couldn't lavish enough praise on it. It won an Oscar for visual effects, innovative at the time using computers in a way that was never done before. The beginning is enough to grab your attention, when the ape-man tosses the bone into the air and in a flash we're transported 4 million years into the future, into outer space. That scene will never been duplicated. Then the discovery of a monolith buried on the moon. The team sent to investigate says It was purposely buried. The deafening transmission that came from the monolith aimed at the planet Jupiter and the amazing trip thru time and space as the lone astronaut enters the black rectangular box. In 2010 his last transmission was played back My God! It's full of stars! Indeed. The ending still gives me chills and yes, it was open to the viewer's own interpretation. For me, seeing the birth of stars, the wonders of the universe, creation in space then Bowman seeing himself grow old and eventually die. His last act, to point at the black monolith as if to say I understand. He died and is transformed into the Star Child. From there you can decide whatever you wish. It's all symbolic after all, a way of telling us the Earth needs a rebirth, a reawakening, a fresh start. The sequel 2010 explained this briefly at the end, when the Earth now had two suns and another monolith appears on one of Jupiter's moons. It's a continuous cycle taking us from ape to man and beyond, to the beginning of a new life cycle and hopefully a better understanding of our universe and ourselves.

The Elephant Man, a deformed human born with an unbearable face that made him inhuman.At first you'd suspect he's an abnormal monster that should be killed. But deep down he is a sensitive man named John Merdick, 21, and very well educated.Over the years he's been living it rough with his condition. He's been beaten and treated badly ever since he joined the sideshow. John only wishes he can walk in daylight with everyone else. The surgeon does not find John to be a freak of nature. So he gives him care at the hospital he works at. Only problem is John is incurable. So it's merely impossible to change his face no mater how professional a surgeon can be.With a bit of hope and care, people of England will soon see John Mereith as a Human like them.This movie has a great morale to it.

I'll try to keep it as unspecific as possible, I promise! Basically Depp's character is a rare book detective, for lack of a better word. He's an expert in the field, and instead of collecting many such books for himself, he instead tracks them down and sets up sales for potential buyers and collectors. He takes a job having to do with a specific book on the occult said to be able to summon Satan himself. Understandably, this is a pretty rare book, having only three copies intact, as most of the other copies were burned along with the author some four hundred years before during the Spanish Inquisition. So, he is given the task by his client (Langella's character) to track down the other two copies of the book and see which is the original, as he believes two of the three to be copies. That is basically the plot outline in a nutshell, as vaguely as can be described without giving too much away.Having some small background in rare books and a fledgling interest in the occult myself, I found the movie to be very interesting. However, if you watch this expecting to see a Devil's Advocate or a Stigmata or some other action-packed religious-undertoned film, think again. I mean, the religious undertones are there, but you kind of have to appreciate the bigger picture with this film; they're not all out in the open and in your face like in the aforementioned titles. From the viewpoint of a student of literature, this is a good film. From someone wanting to see the devil incarnate blow stuff up and a righteous hero come in to save the day, it's probably not for you. However, again, I'd recommend it to anyone willing to sit through it in an attempt to appreciate the subtle undertones presented therein.Although they didn't dissuade me from enjoying the film overall, I did notice a couple of small foibles. The book(s) in question (as well as others that are seen throughout the film) are supposed to be ultra-rare and extremely old, but they are presented in almost brand new condition, which is utterly impossible even if they had been kept in immaculate condition ever since they were printed. Such paper naturally grows brittle and yellow over time, and the bindings, although made of sturdy leather, will inevitably over time begin to crack and break. Also, none of the extensive collections presented in the film were pampered nearly enough in accordance with their respective worths; they were kept in almost direct sunlight, unshelved in some cases, and open to regular air, and yet if ancient books were actually kept under such circumstances, it would greatly reduce their respective lifespans. Finally, throughout the film, Depp's character does not handle the books in the way any real self-respecting rare book expert would. He constantly manhandles the books with his bare hands (natural acid from human hands will only help to erode pages in ancient books that much faster) when he should have been using a pair of clean white gloves and by all rights a page-turner (basically a small spade-like tool). He also smokes constantly around the old texts, which again is a big no-no. It does nothing but destroy the lifespan and lower the resell value.Anyway, sorry for the side-tracked tangent! It was a good flick overall, if you can overlook some small problems in vocational portrayal.

Producer-director Stephen Sommers (The Mummy series and The Scorpion King) have whipped up yet another entertaining popcorn movie (check in your brain and enjoy). Sommers misses perfection by a few missteps. Had he toned down the gore a smidgen, the MPAA might have give him another PG-13, which is more in line for a movie geared toward teenagers and young adults. He also shouldn't have killed off a dominant character so early (More on that, under SPOILERS). At least two scenes are unconvincing dramatically (also, under SPOILERS). Finally, the opening CGI of Treat Williams boat and of the cruise ship are so cheesy, I almost shut the movie off before discovering how much fun it really is.WARNING SPOILERS Providing a plot layout would spoil the fun. I went into this one knowing nothing about it, except that it involved sea monsters. However, for the initiated, let me talk about Sommers missteps a bit. First, killing off Leila (Una Damon) so early was a mistake. Her interplay with Treat Williams and Kevin O'Conner is the first and one of the best pleasures of the movie. It doesn't hurt that Leila is a real cutie, but tough enough to be the equal of any man in the film. Of course, there appears to be an unwritten law in Hollywood; any chick with boobs bigger than the leading lady's has to die. Also, I wonder, since the two most dramatic death scenes involve Asians, if Stephen Sommers is making a wry comment about the Asian penchant for sushi (serving up a Calimari that bites back.)I've already mentioned the gore and cheesy CGI, so it's time to mention the two unconvincing scenes. It's been made pretty clear the monsters are incredibly strong. They buckle steel several inches thick throughout the film. Second, when they attack, between their strength and savagery, a full grown man is reduced to pulp in an instant. So how is it one of the monsters takes so long to kill Wes Studi, and the great grand-daddy of them all handles Treat Williams without leaving even a mark?

For quality it is worth more, and because it may be construed as condoning aspects of immoral behaviour, less. Whether it does actually condone that which is wrong is open to debate. So, too, is the matter of predictability. Are you expecting blissful lovers to disappear into a glorious sunset?For this period drama, you do have to suspend reality and accept the parameters required for the film to work. We are asked to believe that, way back in the first half of the nineteenth century, a comatose woman, seemingly unable even to blink, would have survived for years, and still have significant life expectancy. Medical science makes such a thing possible in our time, but how would the patient have been fed in those days? Don't let such considerations put you off. For other titles, we accept time travel, real people living inside computer memory, oriental gentlemen waving scimitars who run up vertical walls and jump over tall buildings, and still enjoy the show.Sophie Marceau's acting was outstanding. Who would have thought that Elisabeth Laurier in 'Firelight' and Lila Dubois in 'Lost & Found' were played by the same person? Stephen Dillane, playing Charles Godwin, was more than adequate as the other main lead. The rest of the characters were well cast, each contributing significantly to this very moving tale. 'Firelight' covers part of the lives of two essentially principled people trying to find a way through the distressing circumstances with which each was faced. If they took a wrong turn, which of us is going to throw the first stone? Judgment of every individual is God's prerogative. If this film does nothing else, it does show why there is a debate about euthanasia. I had two special adult friends outside our immediate family early in life, one as a child and one as a youth. Both had flaws in their characters, but were excellent mentors. I chose to adopt some of their traits, but not others. A couple of years past retirement age, I bought my first television, and have since discovered films. I find these very instructive, giving me insights into the human condition which I would not have otherwise. As with my mentors, I am using my discrimination when assessing any messages suggested by each movie. I found 'Firelight' emotionally stimulating, its characters eminently admirable in many respects, but used my beliefs and discretion in determining the validity of any moral that may be inferred from its plot. Isn't this what we all do?Some review comments seem to be denigrating Charles Godwin unfairly. It was Lord Clare who ruined the estate by his profligacy. Charles, on the other hand, was trying to keep the boat afloat as a sheep farmer. To suggest that Charles viewed Elisabeth as little more than a chattel doesn't ring true with me. I gained the impression that he was considering her as well as himself right from the beginning. I also felt that their motives tended towards the welfare of others rather than their own selfish ends. The firelight allegory might also be less simplistic than is being suggested. If I am recalling events correctly, I thought the initial use was to introduce a plot continuity. This was progressed to a vehicle used by Elisabeth to allow her daughter the opportunity to break free of her antagonistic attitudes. At some point, the firelight rekindled a significant memory. Finally, for Amy, the firelight was conspicuous by its absence. Were the words, May God have mercy on us, just a common expression, or were they spoken from the heart? Judge for yourself.I looked for the DVD, hoping that it would have an audio commentary. Guess what? Buena Vista has allowed the title to become currently 'out of print', so I couldn't even buy the film itself (!) That surprised me, considering the number of reviewers and the high average rating. I'm looking forward to seeing this film again, but will have to wait for it to come around once more on TV. Do keep an eye open for it in your programme guides.

As with my mentors, I am using my discrimination when assessing any messages suggested by each movie. I found 'Firelight' emotionally stimulating, its characters eminently admirable in many respects, but used my beliefs and discretion in determining the validity of any moral that may be inferred from its plot. Isn't this what we all do?Some review comments seem to be denigrating Charles Godwin unfairly. It was Lord Clare who ruined the estate by his profligacy. Charles, on the other hand, was trying to keep the boat afloat as a sheep farmer. To suggest that Charles viewed Elisabeth as little more than a chattel doesn't ring true with me. I gained the impression that he was considering her as well as himself right from the beginning. I also felt that their motives tended towards the welfare of others rather than their own selfish ends. The firelight allegory might also be less simplistic than is being suggested. If I am recalling events correctly, I thought the initial use was to introduce a plot continuity. This was progressed to a vehicle used by Elisabeth to allow her daughter the opportunity to break free of her antagonistic attitudes. At some point, the firelight rekindled a significant memory. Finally, for Amy, the firelight was conspicuous by its absence. Were the words, May God have mercy on us, just a common expression, or were they spoken from the heart? Judge for yourself.I looked for the DVD, hoping that it would have an audio commentary. Guess what? Buena Vista has allowed the title to become currently 'out of print', so I couldn't even buy the film itself (!) That surprised me, considering the number of reviewers and the high average rating. I'm looking forward to seeing this film again, but will have to wait for it to come around once more on TV. Do keep an eye open for it in your programme guides. If and when it appears, it's well worth watching.

Some will love it, and some will hate it. I have given it five stars out of ten, just to place myself precisely in the middle. For quality it is worth more, and because it may be construed as condoning aspects of immoral behaviour, less. Whether it does actually condone that which is wrong is open to debate. So, too, is the matter of predictability. Are you expecting blissful lovers to disappear into a glorious sunset?For this period drama, you do have to suspend reality and accept the parameters required for the film to work. We are asked to believe that, way back in the first half of the nineteenth century, a comatose woman, seemingly unable even to blink, would have survived for years, and still have significant life expectancy. Medical science makes such a thing possible in our time, but how would the patient have been fed in those days? Don't let such considerations put you off. For other titles, we accept time travel, real people living inside computer memory, oriental gentlemen waving scimitars who run up vertical walls and jump over tall buildings, and still enjoy the show.Sophie Marceau's acting was outstanding. Who would have thought that Elisabeth Laurier in 'Firelight' and Lila Dubois in 'Lost & Found' were played by the same person? Stephen Dillane, playing Charles Godwin, was more than adequate as the other main lead. The rest of the characters were well cast, each contributing significantly to this very moving tale. 'Firelight' covers part of the lives of two essentially principled people trying to find a way through the distressing circumstances with which each was faced. If they took a wrong turn, which of us is going to throw the first stone? Judgment of every individual is God's prerogative. If this film does nothing else, it does show why there is a debate about euthanasia. I had two special adult friends outside our immediate family early in life, one as a child and one as a youth. Both had flaws in their characters, but were excellent mentors. I chose to adopt some of their traits, but not others.
