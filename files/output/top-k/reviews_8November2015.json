I seems it's very thoughtful , that for the time they did not look at patients as a human , but more as a thing to be nurtured and then send at home or die. After he had been admitted , he began at Veginal Medieal Univerreity to become a doctor , but he would not be any doctor , he would like to be a doctor with humor. He did not like the way that the traditional doctor was, that was a doctor who would keep the forms and be professional and not have anything personal in it. I really like the way that Patch Adams think , because all people have the needs to communicate with others, and have a sense of humor in their course so not everything is so seriously. The scene where Patch Adams accidentally go in to the departments of children, because he did not have to be seen by Dean Walcott. This scene it's really good, because it tells a lot about how sad children can be, if it gets too serious. I really liked the way that Patch Adams came in contact with the small children. I also really like the scene where Patch Adams open his own hospital, where there is room for everyone, even those who needed to talk. It was very fascinating how all the patients responded to the treatment they received. They were much more pleased when they left the hospital. I think it was because they were trying to help them in the best way . I can certainly recommend the film to anyone who really likes a good movie with Robin Williams. It also gives a lot of thoughts after watching it.

The importance of believing in your self. Sometimes you need to do what others don't believe in, to proof them wrong. And that's what this movie is all about. Do what is right for you as long as it does something good for others to. But it is also showing that the right thing, is not always the happy safe thing to do, because the main character falls in love with a woman from the school, and just when things gets really good between these two, something bad happens to her. It makes him leave the place he built up, because for a moment he can't see how this place can be right and good anymore. I love how the movie shows the effect of a hospital clown, how much happiness it brings to both children and adults! What it takes to help people, that it's more than just the right medication and getting healthy without fever. It's also the mental part, connecting with these people by talking to them, listening to them and show them you really care about them, and not just the physical problems. What this man did for our health care system is magnificent! He changed the way we saw the sick people, and how we need to help them, how happiness can heal a sick person, and make them motivated for changing their lifes. I just really think it's a good movie, you will get a good idea of what has happened in our health care systems, and how the nurses and doctors looked at patience before, and what's changed and how it's changed now.

It is a 1999 American science fiction comedy-drama film, directed and produced by Chris Columbus, starring Robin Williams, Sam Neill, Embeth Davidtz (in a dual role), Wendy Crewson, and Oliver Platt.This film impresses by the author's idea about the future, robots and nanotechnology. The plot of this film is thrilling and deep. In our days people can't imagine the world without gadgets and computers. This is part of our life. Chris Columbus shows us the world in which robots have also become an integral part of people's lives. This story is about robot Andrew in Martin's family. He performed housekeeping and maintenance duties. He is no ordinary robot. He is unique. It is impossible to imagine that Andrew can feel. After many years he served the Martin's family Andrew eventually asks for his freedom, much to Martin's dismay. Then Andrew builds himself a home and lives alone.

A true Schumacher masterpiece and a classic horror film! I love The Lost Boys so much, it is one of the best true horror movies ever made from the 80's! I always loved this movie since I was a child and the vampires in here are awesome! It encompasses everything that was so silly and cheesy and fun about the 80's. The hair, the clothes, the music, the attitude - it seemed like nobody ever took themselves too seriously in that time. Hell, look at Tim Capello's cameo in the movie, for Christ's sake! Super oiled-up buff sax-playing dude in tight purple spandex? Only in the 80's!The story is about Michael (Jason Patric) and his brother Sam (Corey Haim) who move together with their mother to stay with their grandfather in Santa Carla, California. One day Michael meets a girl and falls for her to know later that she is with a gang of guys who are vampires. They give him wine mixed with blood and Michael drinks it without knowing what it contains. Things change for Michael and he finds out the truth. He tries his best to resist the urge of becoming a vampire and fights it with the help of his brother Sam. This vampire movie is the epitome of excellent humor\/horror. Just when you are sitting on the edge of your seat getting ready for the next scary scene you get a joke or a snide remark. As you are relaxed by the humor, you get hit with a nail bitter of a scary scene. The soundtrack is one of the best I've ever heard; some of my favorite music came from this soundtrack. One of my favorite movies that I ever love a true classic, I think for once Joel Schumacher did a great job as the director, He screwed up Batman & Robin (1997) but he made this movie right! This film is probably the best vampire movie I have ever seen, one of my favorites and the soundtrack was awesome loved Cry Little Sister and all of the tracks. The cast all around was very solid too I think probably the best cast for a vampire movie yet. I miss the 80's classic films, like one of them was Fright Night (1985) this movie is released 2.years later and it is another Vampire movie and right behind him. Gosh I want more Vampire flicks from the 80's like this one is. The Lost Boys is like Twilight of it's late 80's day. The difference between the two is that Lost Boys is a rock-n-roll vampire flick mixed with some goofy humor to make it the cult classic is has become ever since it came and went from theaters to VHS.In this film are famous stars like are Jason Patric, Corey Haim, Kiefer Sutherland as Jack Bauer from 24 (2001) TV show, one of my all time favorite TV shows. Corey Feldman and of course Alex Winter he played in Death Wish 3, Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure and it's sequel Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey gosh I miss those movies. Why can't they make movies like are this ones today? The Lost Boys, Fright Night, Death Wish 3, Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure, Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey are classic movies where are they now?Sleep all day. Party all night. Never grow old. Never die. It's fun to be a vampire. When a single mother and her two sons move to the sleepy seaside California town of Santa Clara, they discover much more than they anticipated in this visually stunning blend of hip humor, horror and rock 'n' roll about the most compelling group of contemporary vampires ever to put fang to vein. That is actually the basic plot of the film! Anyway I am giving this film a 10\/10 because the film deserves it and it doesn't deserve to be bashed and hated from people! I love this film to death I love it!!! The Lost Boys is a 1987 American horror comedy film starring Jason Patric, Corey Haim, Kiefer Sutherland, Jami Gertz, Corey Feldman, Dianne Wiest, Edward Herrmann, Alex Winter, Jamison Newlander, and Barnard Hughes. 10\/10 Score Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio Warner Bros.
