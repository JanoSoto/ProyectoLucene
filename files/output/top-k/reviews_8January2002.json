You can see where Lucas obtained his 'vision' for his saga! Obi Wan - Gandalf. Luke - Frodo. Han Solo - Aragorn. Leia - Arwen. Comparisons will inevitably be drawn. I went into this film completely cold. Hadn't read the book. Hadn't even been on the hype wagon until a few months before it's release and I must say, I was blown away. Unfortunately, on my first viewing, there were some rather rude children, and adults talking and laughing throughout, and this distracted me from the film. I have since seen this film 3 times, and it just gets better! Ian McKellen should get an Oscar for his portrayal of Gandalf the Grey, some  actors are born to play some roles, and with McKellen, you looked at him and  though that he WAS Gandalf. The same goes for Viggo Mortensen. He played,  well he didn't even play Aragorn, again he WAS the character. FEW PLOT SPOILERS AROUND! When I first went to see this film, I thought that the whole film would be about the fellowship going to FIND the ring, I had no idea that they HAD the ring and were safeguarding it for it's destruction. So this was a surprise to me. Peter Jackson!!! What a job! he's only made 5 films and he can create something as beautiful as this! The SFX are fantastic, bordering on flawless. (and I hate these SAD people who actually watch the film and pick out the mistakes, that really BUGS me. Get a life you people!!!) Where was I...? Oh yes, Jackson. If he doesn't win Best Director, then something's wrong. I know it's an event film, but what was Gladiator? And I love that too! The costume department, and make up effects guys should get nods for their outstanding accomplishment on this film. The orcs, goblins, troll's etc were very scary especially the leader of the Urac Hai, he scared me witless, and the scene between him and Sean Bean and Viggo was filled with intensity! The comic potential was used well too. Much needed in a film that is this dark. I think Legolas was a great character and I enjoyed the initial hatred between him and Gimli, towards the end the relationship became somewhat mutual. This film has opened during a time when the forces of good and evil ARE fighting. It's a strong reminder that everyone, regardless of their race or religion should unite to overcome such forces. It's the triumph of the 'little people' over the overwhelming evil. Good timing, even though it's coincidental. We all need escapism at the moment, and what better place to go than the world that Tolkien?Peter Jackson have created for us!!! The film did drag when we were introduced to Galadriel. Blanchett, who I admire as an actress seemed a little too laid back and monotonous for my liking. Mind you , I havn't read the books, so who am I to judge, but as a film, she didn't hit the right chord with me. Above all, this is a male film, and I felt that the love story didn't damage that feel, some friends have complained that Arwen doesn't even appear that long in the book, so why boost her character? I felt it worked. There is so much to say about this film. Elijah Wood? didn't go overboard on him, but he was strong, and I believe he is developed further - as will all characters! - in the Two Towers. HUGE PLOT SPOILER HERE!!!! What happened to Gandalf, It took 5 mins for it to sink in! how could that happen? it was the biggest surprise shock I have witnessed since the killing off of Marion Crane in Hitchcock's Psycho!! Good thing that I didn't read the book! Can we all wait another year for this epic story to conclude? no way!!! I'm going to read the book all in one go - I'll give myself a few weeks, locked away with a bottle of Jack Daniel's and some biscuits and enjoy!!!All in all, this is a beautifully realised and splendidly shot film.

Overall, I think this challenge was met pretty well.In my view, the film version manages a satisfying portrayal of most of the book's characters, and especially of Gandalf and Frodo.  I had some reservations about the portrayal of Merry and Pippin, who come across as buffoons in the film.  In the book they are young and brash, but they aren't stupid.  It's hard to see the reason for the change, unless it's to get some cheap laughs at their expense.  The visual portrayal of places and characters worked successfully, although some of it (Isengard, and the portrayal of the orcs, for example) was a bit over the top for my taste.The director did an excellent job of selecting which parts of the book to include and which to omit.  The difficult challenge of conveying the history behind the quest was dealt with in the best way possible, using Isildur's defeat of Sauron as the key historical event.The treatment of many of the battle scenes did not appeal to me.  A number of these (such as the one near the end after Boromir tries to take the Ring from Frodo, and the fight with the cave troll in Moria) were changed from the book, often lengthening them or making them more complex for no apparent reason other than to increase the amount of limb-hacking, possibly to appeal more to a juvenile male audience.(SPOILER ALERT)I was disappointed by the treatment of the Council of Elrond, which is the turning point of the Fellowship of the Ring volume.  In the book, the decision to send the Ring to the fire is taken after a long debate in which all the participants are involved.  In the film, Elrond makes the decision in advance of the Council meeting, and the meeting descends into an unseemly squabble which Frodo resolves by announcing that he will take the Ring. Also, those in the audience who had not read the book must have been mystified by the sudden appearance, with no explanation, of Boromir, Legolas and Gimli.  In the book they are introduced at the Council meeting and the reasons for their arrival in Rivendell are properly explained.  This is particularly important in the case of Boromir, who comes after a dream in which he is enjoined to `Seek for the Sword that was broken', etc.I found at least one change from the book to be an improvement - the treatment of Arwen.  I had wondered before seeing the film what Liv Tyler would have to do, since in the book Arwen is no more than an ornament and marriage fodder for Aragorn.  In the film she is given a role of greater action.  This changes her character somewhat, but is I think it is an improvement.Overall, despite some shortcomings, most of those who enjoyed Tolkien's book would approve of the way that Peter Jackson's film version has accepted the enormous challenges of bringing this story to the screen, and will look forward to seeing The Two Towers.  7\/10.
