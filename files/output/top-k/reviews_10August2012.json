I hadn't seen it for years, going back decades probably. I saw it originally when it came out, as I was only a couple of years junior to those portrayed on the screen. Like others have mentioned, the acting was superb and true to life. Not one second on screen do you feel anyone is acting. Dennis Christopher as lead character David Stoller is really a joy to behold. His enthusiasm is never forced or fake. He pulls it off beautifully. And Dennis Quaid's Mike character is probably all too common in this world of high school stars peaking with graduation. His story is quietly repeated among so many who saw their best years in high school only to watch others get the longer lasting glory. The speeches he gives are poignant, deep and yet perfectly fitting of his character. He does a wonderful job of showing the frustration of change. Daniel Stern's Cyril is perfect as the more comical of the bunch - simply perfect casting. Some of his lines are just priceless. And Jack Earl Haley and 'Moocher' looks like so many of us looked like back then, me included (though I wasn't short). Long straggly hair, t shirt, jeans and string-bean skinny. Paul Dooley and Barbara Barrie were wonderful. As were the brief shots of others at the Little 500. I can only imagine they were locals hired as extras. Hart Bochner (Lloyd's son) did a fine job as the snob jock. Gotta admit, they didn't come better looking than that back then. I sometimes wonder if Paul McTiernan didn't intentionally subject Hart to that somewhat comical but deadly ending in Die Hard out of payback for being such a jerk in Breaking Away.Katherina played by Robyn Douglass was wonderful. She had that perfect look of girls you would just die for back then. She even resembled a girl me and my pals were all in love with back in Chatham Township high school. I loved her scenes and her moment when she finds out the truth. Really jolts you out of your seat. Choked me up. Watching this film really made me aware of how we've changed, not just in our clothing or hair styles, but in our entire lives. Everything is brand-name now, everyone is so conscious of who made the object they desire and how much it cost. The more expensive the better. Everything is new and shiny. Every single element in a movie is examined from eyeglasses to shoes to pens. Everything is measured for its affluence and brand quality. Back then, we had Schwinns, Huffys, Raleighs, even Sears and whatever else we could afford. We wore clothes just like those kids in the move wore, T shirts, old jeans cut-offs in summer, and ripped up sneakers. We had fishing holes or swimming holes and spent enormous amounts of time riding bikes, or just laying in the grass or on rocks in the sun, or up in some tree house, just thinking or talking or planning out the universe... and also about girls, which none of us had actually had any meaningful contact with yet. A magical time in a boy's life. Reminds me of the time we discovered an old playboy in the woods under a fallen tree. It was a huge deal with us at the time. We'd hide it back under the tree trunk wrapped in some plastic and go back to it when we were back there. Nowadays, the most descriptive and graphic porn that even Ripley wouldn't believe is simply a click away 24\/7. It's a different world, indeed. (Ironically, as a side note, the Playboy issue, we found out years later was the one that highlighted the ill-fated Dorothy Stratton.)Nowadays, can you imagine anyone, especially a 19 year old kid sitting still out in nature or anywhere else for that matter for even ten seconds without whipping out a smart-phone or some other gadget? Or being seen not having just the right clothes, just the right Nikes or Adidas sneakers? We had converse back then, and they were the cheap sneakers. It's just sad that such a time in life is gone forever, not just in the styles which were, yes, sloppy, an unkempt, but in the way kids lived. It's an entirely different world today and I wouldn't trade my childhood in the 70s and early 80s with any kid today for all the money in the world. I sat through the film twice, loving it so much and knowing I'd probably never get a chance to see it on the big screen again. Watching it with tears in my eyes, I really felt such an urge that if I could have, I would've climbed into that screen in a second to go back to that time once again that is never more. Just like Willoughby must've been to Rod Serling.

My older brother, father and 13 year old self hit the movie theater, pumped to see another Michael J. Fox\/Zemeckis teaming that we have long since loved since the days of 'Back to the Future'. It's the day after the film opened and the theater was filled with about 10 people (my brother, dad and myself included). The movie rolls and, by the end, I was jumping with how incredibly cool and fun the movie was. And to this day, the same holds true This is one of the best horror comedies of all-time, if not THE best, and is Jackson's best film to date.I'm sure, by now, you now the premise of the film based on the reviews prior to mine, so I wont bore you with all the babble of what the film is all about. I will, however, give my input as to why this film rocks!!! For one, it has Michael J. Fox. It had been a while since I had seen him in a film (I believe the last one I saw before 'The Frighteners' was 'Life With Mikey') and he was fantastic in this. His portrayal of a ghost hunting con man is a personal favorite of mine. No matter how he acted in the film, whether it was serious or downright goofy, he managed to keep his character extremely likable...as always...and interesting. It seems as though he had a blast with this film. Another reason why this film was so cool was the lack of EXTREME gore that Jackson had used and was known for in his prior films ('Bad Taste', 'Braindead'). Instead, he relied more on story and character development, along with creating some of the best ghost effects ever seen. He did all of this without having to sacrifice a great story with incredibly gory effects. Also, when was the last time you saw a ghost...bleed??? But these aren't the only reasons why you should see this movie. Here are ALL the other reasons why you shouldn't miss this film -The awesome and strange Jeffrey Yes I am, I'm an ass****...with a Uzi! Combs ('Re-Animator') in a GREAT, GREAT...GREAT performance.-The very talented and always sweet Dee Wallace-Stone ('The Howling', 'The Hills Have Eyes') in a very creepy performance.-Another incredibly brilliant, atmospheric and moody score from the great Danny Elfman ('Batman', 'The Nightmare Before Christmas').There were also A lot of great surprises in this film -R. Lee Ermey ('Full Metal Jacket', 'Willard') in a classic spoof of one of his own characters, from another film. An amazing touch.-John Astin (Gomez, 'The Addams Family' TV show) in a very good performance as the coolest looking ghost of all A rotting Judge (they don't call him the hanging judge for nothing').And a surprisingly good Jake Busey ('Starship Troopers') as a serial killer. (You will never see teeth as perfect and as white in another film until you see Jake's when he is killing people. They are very Looney Tunes...which was a very nice touch to make his character extra creepy.) All of this, along with a cool, afro-sporting, funky 70's ghost of Chi McBride ('Boston Public'), an underrated Trini Alvarado and not to mention the awesome script, makes this a film that should be on your TO WATCH RIGHT NOW list if you haven't seen it already.* If anything, watch this film for the final half, especially when our two heroes enter the old, abandoned Hospital. Some cool, cool stuff. * With the LOTR films, I'm sure there are a lot people who have either seen or have yet to see this film solely because of those fantasy epics, which is sad because this is a wonderful film all by itself. I'm proud to say that I saw this film when it opened, in the theater, and that I have been a fan of this and many of Jackson's earlier (and much better) films for a long time now.I am just as pumped for this new unrated directors cut as I was that day at the movies when I was 13. I'm anxious to see what kind of extra footage is in this version. I'm hoping, like many others, that they will have the complete documentary on this film because that would just be the icing on the cake. All that we fans can do now is wait and watch the calendar for the day this DVD arrives.Visually stunning and atmospheric, very funny, very spooky (at times very serious) but ALWAYS fun, THE FRIGHTENERS has everything you need for a night of great movie watching.NOTE If you're not a fan of gore, you're in luck. This film has very minimal gore. Yes, there is blood and some gory moments, but for the most part, it's VERY timid compared to Peter Jackson's older films that include some of the goriest scenes in movie history. (i.e. 'Braindead'). It's enough to satisfy all you gore-hounds out there, but not so much that it will turn you non-gore fans away.So if your dying to see a great, frighteningly funny and spooky film, check out THE FRIGHTENERS...before your number is up.

I'm hoping, like many others, that they will have the complete documentary on this film because that would just be the icing on the cake. All that we fans can do now is wait and watch the calendar for the day this DVD arrives.Visually stunning and atmospheric, very funny, very spooky (at times very serious) but ALWAYS fun, THE FRIGHTENERS has everything you need for a night of great movie watching.NOTE If you're not a fan of gore, you're in luck. This film has very minimal gore. Yes, there is blood and some gory moments, but for the most part, it's VERY timid compared to Peter Jackson's older films that include some of the goriest scenes in movie history. (i.e. 'Braindead'). It's enough to satisfy all you gore-hounds out there, but not so much that it will turn you non-gore fans away.So if your dying to see a great, frighteningly funny and spooky film, check out THE FRIGHTENERS...before your number is up. Because, When your numbers up...*SNAP*...that's it. ","genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"10 August 2012","score":"","review":" Pal Joey (1957)This is a vehicle for Frank Sinatra to sing.

And it has some nice full Technicolor filming in and around San Francisco which is its own attraction. But Sinatra rules nearly every scene. He has his regular guy persona, perfected years ago for lots of musicals and even some dramas, with the slight tweak that he's a bit full of himself. Except we know it's an act just to survive. He meets chorus girl Novak and likes her rather a lot, and he meets high society and ex-showgirl stripper Hayworth and likes her rather less, but they seem to have some hot flashes anyway. And he needs her money to make it big in town.That's the plot, as the two women vie for his attention. Meanwhile a new nightclub featuring, yes, singing and dancing, is opening and so that becomes the center of all the swirling. It's all predictably held back from anything realistic, of course. I mean, Sinatra is this guy who's totally broke and desperate, but he doesn't really show it. (He says it.) When he swoops on stage at the first opportunity it's all in that fantasy world of possibilities that are what make musicals musicals. Those of you who are tempted to say, Oh, come on! you need to let go and just find the flow. Get used to the idea that it's a kind of parallel universe, slightly false and dreamlike on purpose. The improbable is meant to be just that because it's more fun that way!Meanwhile there's Sinatra the singer. He goes through a whole list of numbers, some of them rather famous, and he hums and sings bits of other great songs. These include My Funny Valentine which Novak performs in full on stage, and Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered which Hayworth performs to herself in her spacious bedroom. Both of the women's vocals are dubbed in by other vocalists, however.And yes, there are some really famous songs here. The composers are none other than Rogers and Hart, coming from their 1940 Broadway play of the same name (and originally starring Gene Kelly). Most of the songs originated there, but four, including The Lady is a Tramp and My Funny Valentine came from a 1937 musical Babes in Arms, also by Rogers and Hart. The charts are by the great Nelson Riddle, who arranged Sinatra's most classic albums of the 1950s. Everything is in pitch perfect form here, and if you want a dose of pure Sinatra, the actor and singer, this is the place to start.

Just one example of this is that the men went to see a drive-in movie and Morris shows up the advertisement from the paper showing that the movies were playing. The real drama comes from the fact that everything seems to say that Adams is innocent and the only reason he was brought to trial was because people were lying. Just hearing from the witnesses as they talk about the lies they're telling is something so tense that you really couldn't get the same level of suspense from a made up movie.

For even though they're all incarcerated for various crimes against humanity, they appear to be more sympathetic than the brutal guards who play for semi-pro glory under Warden Hazen (Eddie Albert). I remember thinking that Albert was miscast when I first saw this, calling to mind his Green Acres TV character, but I have to say, he really gets into his role here and is particularly effective as a villain.The film makes effective use of a variety of real life pro football players, guys like Ray Nitschke (Bogdanski), Sonny Sixkiller (The Indian) and Ernie Wheelwright (Spooner), thereby lending some additional authenticity to the game scenes. I know there's already been a 2005 remake starring Adam Sandler, but wouldn't it be something if they made another picture using the Cincinnatti Bengals as the all-prison team? You can't get any more real than that.What I think I enjoyed the most about the film was the integrity shown by characters like old Pop (John Steadman) and Granville (Harry Caesar), and eventually even Paul Crewe (Reynolds) himself. You can't help but think of them as honorable men even if they made mistakes in their life that wound them up in prison. There's also the humor in bits like the swamp reclamation scene, the 'broke his 'f...ing neck' scene, and the Bogdanski ball-breaker sequence.I'm not one for repeated viewings of the same flick but I've seen this one a few times over the years and I still get a kick out of it.

It's one of those independents that got overlooked by the public but not by the critics and certainly not by fans of the incomparable Nick Nolte. I won't give a lot of details or a plot summary since it's been done several times already.Affliction is the story of how alcoholism is a disease some family members catch but all are affected by negatively in some way. James Coburn, family patriarch, has the disease. Nick Nolte, eldest son, catches it. And both Willem Dafoe, youngest son, and Mary Beth Hurt, wife, are affected by it. The wife is beaten into submission years before while the youngest son in scared to death of his father and as he says in the film, I was a careful child and I became a careful adult (explaining how one episode caused him to be very careful around his father and thus, it is now his role in life).But for this film, we are focusing on Nolte and Coburn who are so intense in this movie it is beyond belief that there was not a two-fer Oscar win for their performances. This is a father-son screen story for the ages worthy of a Greek tragedy. And as we join them at their current ages and the current stage of the battle, they are a frightening dynamic to watch.See the story in the Trivia section of the preparation conversation between the director Paul Schrader and Coburn. It is a true shame that we were not given the opportunity to see Coburn truly act more often. I always liked Coburn since he seemed likable but his career was a string of mainstream mediocrity in which he was punching a clock. This role shows us the depth of this man's talent that sadly Hollywood and he wasted with choices more like the embarrassing Snow Dogs than true acting vehicles such as this.For Nolte it was yet again another shaft by the Academy. People seem to be happy to equate Nolte's talent with the infamous mug shot that is so happily reprinted from a substance-related arrest. Why I do not know. I cannot think of another actor that I would lay down my money to see and know that am guaranteed my money's worth from his efforts at least. As someone mentioned in the comments, Tom Hanks (who also lost out on an Oscar in the same category losing to the lead role from the most insulting and disrespectful film made in many years, Life is Beautiful), would never have considered taking Nolte's role. Never. He is not going to take a role which contrasts with his good guy image and so we are treated to an endless stream of average, nice guy wins roles from him while Nolte, who takes more chances than any other actor in Hollywood, is continually ignored. This part is as skillfully crafted as his role in Mother Night. You can see more of his talent in Nightwatch and more recently in Off The Black, another small film he makes a big impact in. All ignored by the Academy.Nolte's skill makes his paranoid reactions to situations believable where other actors would make it comical or simply awkward. His anger and angst as well as his broken personality bursts out of the screen. Throughout this film his character PLEADS for help in every way he can without sacrificing that tough, leathery exterior that real men are supposed to have in this country (at least of that generation, that last generation it was expected of) and that his father holds up as the highest achievement any man can attain. But he is a broken man, broken deep inside where it is nearly impossible to repair and must start with a soul being opened up completely like a gutted, helpless fish which is not something men growing up in a situation like this can ever do, during or after (though honestly there is never an after ... it is always during ... and it is for the rest of your life). Nolte makes it all so real and genuine many comments on this board say he must not be acting and must really be like this. I don't know Mr. Nolte personally and I am certain others saying this do not. It's just one more way of snubbing his immense and honest talent in favor of what the news media and the hammerheads on the internet would rather have you believe is the Nolte that matters, that is, that infamous mug shot.And what different thing does Nolte bring to every role? What makes the actor so unique? One thing I always notice is the walk, the gate of each character. In Affliction it is a rhythmic, self-assured stride as he is protecting what little of his insides there is left to try to save. But as the anger and the madness take him, the stride is hard, punching, and off-center.In Off The Black, his stride is also off-center, physically with his right foot pointing out and his left foot pointing in as he angles through his uncertain life, uncertain of himself and his place in the world.I'm running out of room as I always do but Sissy Spacek and Willem Dafoe make big things of their smaller parts and flesh out the fun house mirror-feeling of the central figure's life that keeps us all off-balance to the sudden and brutal end.Schrader directs this group to a perfect film in my opinion.

The gang at Dawson High doesn't appreciate his fancy wardrobe or his humor. The gang's leader, Buzz (Corey Allen) deflates a tire on Jim's car with a switchblade as Buzz's girlfriend Judy (Natalie Wood) eggs him on. Jim wants no trouble, but as his tagalong pal Plato (Sal Mineo) tries to warn him, it's no use.It's hard to make friends with these guys, Plato says.I don't want to make friends, Jim answers, looking cool but sounding uncertain.The only lead role Dean ever played that didn't get him an Oscar nomination, only because he was competing against himself in East Of Eden, Jim in Rebel is who people think of when they think of Dean. Properly, too; he's riveting and believable here, playing a tough part with casual bemusement and a sensitivity to the moment that one gets only rarely from more seasoned screen performers.One oddity about Rebel is its place in the pantheon of juvenile delinquent films. It doesn't play like one. How unusual is it to see a movie where a youth openly resents his parents for not being firmer with him, and walks away from a fight? There are episodes of violence and danger, but how many other films feature knife-fights where the principals agree to stop before someone gets hurt?Rebel's strongest scene takes place at the Griffith Observatory, where a wizened lecturer tells these young people they live in a cosmos marked only by the shortness of time between our planet's birth and its demise. Poor Plato is so overcome by existential dread that he cowers under the seats, to be coaxed up by Jim in a moment that crystallizes their friendship. It's a movie about kids finding their way in an institution, but also about people struggling to shape themselves in a larger world that shows no signs of caring.In that way, and in others, too, Rebel rises above the standards of its day. There are some serious script problems. Irving Schulman and Stewart Stern get too stuck on the dime-store Freud of their time; that kids' emotional problems can be pegged on distant parents. A police detective played by Edward Platt dispenses wisdom with disconcerting ease I groan when Jim confesses after one such analysis I bet you see right through me, don't you? Poor Natalie has to deliver lines like Yes...no...I don't know, while Dean's most famous line, You're tearing me apart, is something better seen than heard.But even amid such clunky moments, the acting is good. Wood shifts believably from Daddy's cloying little girl to angry gang moll (Are you always at ringside? Jim teases her at one early moment), while Mineo raises the bar in his every scene with his unaffected need for love and attention. Dean delivers a powerful central performance, combining recognizable Brando-esque mannerisms with some off-beat line readings worthy of Robert Mitchum. You have to wonder what the future would have held for him if he only wore a seat belt.Nicholas Ray does a powerhouse job as director balancing the need for domestic realism with fluid pacing and an operatic quality aided by garishly effective WarnerColor and a killer Leonard Rosenman score. It's a quintessential 1950s movie, like others here say. The supporting players are dialed in, from a surprisingly conflicted Allen to Jim Backus's desperately ingratiating father to Jim. One reason Dean gives such a great performance is because, for so much of the film, he has Backus' flustered pop to play off of.Making a point that life matters even if no one cares, Rebel stands as a lasting achievement as well as a memorial to one (as the movie would argue, of many) who died too young.

The gang at Dawson High doesn't appreciate his fancy wardrobe or his humor. The gang's leader, Buzz (Corey Allen) deflates a tire on Jim's car with a switchblade as Buzz's girlfriend Judy (Natalie Wood) eggs him on. Jim wants no trouble, but as his tagalong pal Plato (Sal Mineo) tries to warn him, it's no use.It's hard to make friends with these guys, Plato says.I don't want to make friends, Jim answers, looking cool but sounding uncertain.The only lead role Dean ever played that didn't get him an Oscar nomination, only because he was competing against himself in East Of Eden, Jim in Rebel is who people think of when they think of Dean. Properly, too; he's riveting and believable here, playing a tough part with casual bemusement and a sensitivity to the moment that one gets only rarely from more seasoned screen performers.One oddity about Rebel is its place in the pantheon of juvenile delinquent films. It doesn't play like one. How unusual is it to see a movie where a youth openly resents his parents for not being firmer with him, and walks away from a fight? There are episodes of violence and danger, but how many other films feature knife-fights where the principals agree to stop before someone gets hurt?Rebel's strongest scene takes place at the Griffith Observatory, where a wizened lecturer tells these young people they live in a cosmos marked only by the shortness of time between our planet's birth and its demise. Poor Plato is so overcome by existential dread that he cowers under the seats, to be coaxed up by Jim in a moment that crystallizes their friendship. It's a movie about kids finding their way in an institution, but also about people struggling to shape themselves in a larger world that shows no signs of caring.In that way, and in others, too, Rebel rises above the standards of its day. There are some serious script problems. Irving Schulman and Stewart Stern get too stuck on the dime-store Freud of their time; that kids' emotional problems can be pegged on distant parents. A police detective played by Edward Platt dispenses wisdom with disconcerting ease I groan when Jim confesses after one such analysis I bet you see right through me, don't you? Poor Natalie has to deliver lines like Yes...no...I don't know, while Dean's most famous line, You're tearing me apart, is something better seen than heard.But even amid such clunky moments, the acting is good. Wood shifts believably from Daddy's cloying little girl to angry gang moll (Are you always at ringside? Jim teases her at one early moment), while Mineo raises the bar in his every scene with his unaffected need for love and attention. Dean delivers a powerful central performance, combining recognizable Brando-esque mannerisms with some off-beat line readings worthy of Robert Mitchum.

And for the most part it's a good comedy despite few flaws. The movie centers around two characters, one is Louis Winthorpe III(Dan Aykroyd). Who starts off as a guy that that doesn't know how to wipe his butt cause he is rich to the point his workers does everything for him. In another words he is a over the top stereotypical rich guy. He is resourceful but a bit of a tool, maybe because he is always surrounded by other people that are tools. But it's Dan Aykroyd and he is still likable in this, maybe because the characters sense of righteousness. And the other character is William Raymond Billy Ray Valentine(Eddie Murphy). Who starts out as a ghetto hood rat that has street smart. But tries to lie himself through everything. Basically he is a boy who cried wolf. Until he gets a chance at living a rich lifestyle. Because two tools in the company decides to frame Winthorpe and let a ghetto hood rat into the company and see if he can be successful as well. So basically Winthorpe gets used as a experiment a guinea pig. The bad guys in this movie are corrupt but they also are two of the most stereotypical villains ever, wouldn't be surprised if they started tying a woman to a train track. Everything about this movie is far-fetched, in fact very far-fetched. It lacks logic and doesn't make any sense with the direction and all. It's a movie you just have to go with or will end up nit picking everything that doesn't make any sense or implausible. and I am not just talking about the characters. But it's a funny comedy with clever jokes, that never really rely on toilet humor. When it comes to blending the really rich and ghetto poor character elements together, it's done really well although more development would have made this movie better. The clash of two different backgrounds works. A lot of change in characters in this movie just comes off drastic though and not very believable. Especially Eddie Murphy's character and Jamie Lee Curtis who plays a prostitute in this and I didn't even recognize her until she takes offh her wig. Now I ain't a Eddie Murphy fan but he was just right for this role and likable. So yeah this movie has some very stereotypical characters, especially the rich folks that doesn't really talk about anything else besides bragging about their lifestyle and making money. Actually that maybe pretty much true in a lot of cases in real life.

It is the very first time renowned actors John Wayne and James Stewart appeared alongside each other in a film, and this is only one of the many things that makes The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance a powerfully spectacular film. The film opens with Stewart, who plays Ransom Stoddard, returning to a town where he once lived because of the death of an old friend. Reporters want to know Stoddard's story, so he tells them in one long flashback. This flashback tells the story of how Stoddard came to the town by accident after being held up by the notorious Liberty Valance. Once in town, Stoddard, a lawyer from the East, sets up shop and starts teaching the townsfolk how to read, and about history and politics. However, he's a survivor of the ruthless Liberty Vance, and that threat looms over his head throughout the whole movie. The Man Who Shot Liberty Valnace is an incredible film, and it is absolutely quintessential to the progression of the Western genre from spaghetti to its more modern style of today. It's ingeniously important.This is the film that symbolizes John Ford's knowledge of where his own beloved genre, the Western, was headed. It's a film that represents the maturing of the genre into something wholly new. The town in which the film is set is like any other spaghetti Western locale. It's a lawless gun slinging territory where jurisdiction is not part of the local vernacular, and jail means as much to a man as the word illegal. There are no rules in this dusty Western town, and the rest of the world seems to have no barring on what goes on here. That is, until Ransom Stoddard shows up. He represents the Eastern ideals of lawfulness and government that the Western genre practically pretended didn't exist before. He represents this maturing of the genre into the real world, not some rough and tough shoot em up fantasy land.Of course, with this kind of change you will have those who will hold it back. In the case of this film you have two characters. The first is Lee Marvin as Liberty Valance. He is the epitome of what we know the spaghetti Western outlaw to be. He is afraid of nothing and he plays by his own rules. Beating, robbing, and murdering whoever he pleases. So, as you can imagine, when he comes head to head with the lawman of the more civilized world things get ugly. It's one set of ideals taking over another. Valance's seem to be more outdated, which is why he's the bad guy and Stoddard isn't.But then you have another character which holds back this democratic progression into the lawless West. John Wayne's character as Tom Donaphin. Wayne is the perfect actor for this role because of all that he represents as an actor. He's the face of spaghetti Western. The ultimate gunslinger. The hero of the great plains. So obviously newcomer Stoddard threatens his ideals and is the representation of his face being lost amongst the crumbling of the spaghetti Western. And to drive the point home even further, that is why Donaphin is the character who lies in the coffin at the beginning of the film.This is, essentially, what the underlying theme of The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is. It's a transition piece. One that illustrates the fading away of the spaghetti Western as it is replaced with something more contemporary. What was once a lawless wasteland is given government and democracy that allow it to grow into something more substantial. Throughout the film Stoddard resents the use of guns, as he aims to educate people so that democracy can replace violence and so that education can replace disorder and futile discord in these small Western towns.There's a lot more to this film than I could have ever expected, and all this subtext was a welcome surprise to a film that I thought would be nothing more than another fun spaghetti Western.

I don't say this is a bad film, but to me it's a little illogical...although perhaps that's a different time perspective of the 1930s compared to today. The crux of the film is quite simple -- repeatedly, fliers are crashing and dying flying the mail up over a particular foggy mountain pass in South America. In fact, later in the film, you get to see the mountains, and you KNOW they wouldn't fly into them in the fog...well, actually they would fly into them -- literally -- in the fog. But, the mail must go through!!!!! Why not delay until the fog lifts? But of course, at least often when they crash, the mail is destroyed. So let's see -- the way they're operating, much of the mail never goes through, rather than sometimes just being delayed. Hmmmmmmmmmm. And they are destroying expensive planes in the process. Hmmmmmmmmm. Is this anyway to run an airline??? And of course, Cary Grant and others are very stoic about the repeated deaths, while only Jean Arthur has a lick of sense and sees the tragedy for those who die. Nevertheless, Jean Arthur begins falling in love with Cary Grant, who runs the flying operation...despite the fact that he repeatedly insults her.Many see this as one of Howard Hawks' best directorial efforts, and perhaps it is, once you accept the rather boneheaded premise. Cary Grant's role here is not one you're likely to like him in, and I'm not so sure he even performs it well. There were times I felt he was over-acting (and just for the record, Grant is my favorite actor). Jean Arthur, whom we usually savor in comedies, shows her diversity here in a straight dramatic role. In terms of supporting actor Richard Barthelmess, I can only assume he did his best work in silent films...he certainly wasn't very interesting here.

It still stands tall as one of cinema's ultimate loser strikes back fables and while it may be fiction its themes are still quite relevant. Sissy Spacek excels as the title character, an awkward teenager treated terribly by her fellow students and having to deal with the overbearing presence of her sanctimonious mother (Piper Laurie), a deeply religious individual. Things seem to be improving for Carrie when a popular jock (William Katt) asks her to the prom, only we know the poor girl's nemesis (Nancy Allen) is orchestrating much of the events for the sake of revenge. What very few people know - and unfortunately have to find out - is that Carrie possesses telekinetic abilities, which she unleashes in fury after being mocked and humiliated for the last time. Carrie is one of those characters one can't help but feel sorry for, and any person who's ever been in a similar situation in high school will know her pain. Spacek and Laurie are both incredible in their Oscar nominated performances; the former completely wins you over with her combination of shyness, naivety, and vulnerability. The latter, making a flamboyant return to acting after 15 years away from the business, is purely theatrical, and gets perhaps the most significant refrain in the entire film in the form of They're all gonna laugh at you! Also among the supporting cast are John Travolta, displaying that easy going charisma, Amy Irving (acting opposite her real life mom, Priscilla Pointer), P.J. Soles, Betty Buckley, Sydney Lassick, Stefan Gierasch, Michael Talbott, and Edie McClurg. They're all fun to watch, and De Palma directs with a typical flourish, employing split screen during one critical scene of chaos at the prom. The budget of the film only allowed for a minimum of destruction, yet what makes it onto screen still packs a pretty effective punch; the violence is strong without ever getting too blatantly gory. Some comedy relief is added rather incongruously - the music for the gym detention scenes, the sped up dialogue for the tuxedo shopping sequence - but it doesn't hurt the film at all, and our emotions are manipulated with ease and skill, especially when the haunting music score by the consistently reliable Pino Donaggio is taken into account. The imagery is stunning throughout, including one hell of a creepy little statue, and that now iconic image of Spacek doused in blood. To this date this remains one of the best ever adaptations of a Stephen King work, in this viewer's humble opinion. Followed by a 23 years belated sequel, a made for TV remake, and a pending theatrical remake. Eight out of 10.
