On any other day, that might look strange, Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage) says as he stares out the back of the plane and watches with exasperation.Cameron is having a strange day, indeed. The film begins eight years prior to the present. Cameron returns home from the Military to his pregnant wife, who is being harassed by a band of drunken idiots where she works at the town bar. Shrugging them off, Cameron and his wife are both assaulted by the men when they make a dash for their car in the rainfall outside the place. Defending his wife, Cameron kills the men and is sentenced to 7 - 10 years in prison. Because he is a trained government weapon, his murder charges are a bit different than those of other criminals. Because he knows how to kill more than most people, he is given a longer sentence. If the point of this is to make the audience wonder why in the world the justice system works like this, it has achieved its goal.Flash forward eight years, and Cameron is finally getting parole. Hitching a ride back to his wife on a plane with a band of ruthless criminals, Cameron expects nothing less than a pleasant ride. But when Sirus the Virus (John Malkovich) takes over the plane with his buddy (Ving Rhames), everything goes wrong.Cameron is suddenly an undercover hero. Back on land, a U.S. Marshal played by John Cusack thinks something is wrong. When he finds aircraft blueprints lodged in Sirus' old prison cell, he realizes that the plane could be in trouble. Cameron solidifies the marshal's suspicions when he alerts everyone on ground (in secret) that the plane has been taken over. He also tells them where it's going to be landing.The movie's grand finale--in which the plane lands on a Las Vegas strip--is silly but fun. The film is a Jerry Bruckheimer production that rivals The Rock. Very similar, it's an over-the-top action extravaganza with big explosions, a Die Hard-esque plot, and a surprisingly large human quotient in the mix. It's one of the best action films of the past decade; the type of film all the pale imitators always try to be, and few ever come so close to actually being. Nicolas Cage, who in fact starred in The Rock, is often picked on for bad acting. I like him. Here he provides a sort of gentle hero to the film, more realistic than Stallone would be, not quite as funny as Arnie, but somewhere in between both of them. He was absolutely fabulous in Adaptation (2002), and also in Leaving Las Vegas, for which he won an Oscar. I'm one of his bigger fans. He doesn't disappoint here.John Malkovich is great as the villain. Something about the man has always seemed strange, and he's good at playing oddball serial killers and baddies. Malkovich was creepy and effective in Clint Eastwood's thriller In the Line of Fire, downright silly in Johnny English, lovable in Of Mice and Men, and here he's creepy again.My favorite character in the film has to be that played by Steve Buscemi, though. He makes the Manson family look like the Partridge family, someone tells Cameron. He went on a killing spree and murdered thirty people. He tells Cameron that one time he drove for three hours wearing a little girl's head as a hat. Feel free not to share with me, Cameron tells him.In other cases, Buscemi's character might seem totally evil. Here he's funny, though, because the film makes us think he's murdered again after the plane lands to re-fuel, and then we find out he hasn't when we see his potential victim waving at the plane as it takes off again. That makes him a good guy. It's all contrivances in the script, but it works.

They hit it off and go back to his place where after some lovemaking he finds out that she is a hooker that was hired by his boss but she really likes him and vows to give up prostitution. They get married and Clarence decides to go get her belongings from her pimp Drexl Spivey (Gary Oldman) but after a bloody altercation Drexl and his hired thugs are killed and Clarence grabs a suitcase and runs out. At home they discover millions of dollars in cocaine stashed in the case so they decide to go to California and look up his friend Dick (Michael Rapaport).*****SPOILER ALERT***** They arrive and Dick gets them a deal to sell the cocaine to a famous film producer for 200,000 dollars but the cops find out about it and want to make the bust but Italian gangsters are hot on Clarence's and Alabama's trail.This film was directed by Tony Scott who also directed Top Gun and he has shown good skill at directing action films that keep a steady and exciting pace. But the films real flavor isn't necessarily in the action but in Quentin Tarantino's wonderful script and dialogue. Even when the film slows down and there is no action taking place you're still enthralled by the words spoken by the actors and there is a truly memorable scene involving Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken. The fact that these two terrific actors are interacting in a film was exciting enough but the scene between them is written so splendidly that it has become a classic. Slater is well cast as the hot headed but reckless Clarence and I've always been a big fan of Arquette. They have good chemistry together and this helps the film as we watch this story unfold. The cast is top notch and along with the main leads you can see Brad Pitt, Bronson Pinchot, Samuel L. Jackson, Saul Rubinek, Conchata Ferrell, James Gandolfini, Chris Penn, Tom Sizemore and Ed Lauter. Also, Val Kilmer pops up from time to time as the ghost of Elvis that mentors Clarence in his actions. I personally could have done without the whole Elvis\/Ghost part of the story but this is just nit picking because this is a whole lot of fun to watch. This has more than it's share of violence but this film is highly stylized and generates an abundant of energy that never lets up.

Far away from Hollywood, Jim Jarmusch creates a world where you don't need drama, pathos and action to fascinate the watcher. Because fascinating is exactly what this movie is. A plot in the classical sense is almost completely missing; the scenes, in their simplicity sometimes reminding of theater, follow each other without ever creating real suspense; neither griping action nor complex dialogues are there to excite the spectator. And still, with ease Jarmusch fills more than a hundred minutes with a story you won't take your eyes off. It is hard to tell what the atmosphere of the movie is really based on, the characters, the setting, entirely in black and white, the music - probably all of it. Again, like in Jarmusch's later movie Dead man, speed is an important factor everything moves slowly, without haste, as there is no dramatic climax you could hurry towards; yet, boring is a word that certainly doesn't fit this piece of cineastic art. On the other hand, though some of the scenes seem quite surrealistic, it is not a really artistic movie breaking with all the traditional concepts of filmmaking; it is more a movie in classic shape with an unconventional story, not trying to shock, to confuse or even to make you think so much; this movie doesn't need all this to get your complete attention. You could probably speculate a lot about the meaning of the movie; to me, this seems highly unnecessary. Just let it unfold its atmosphere. Judge yourselves, but I was excited in a very special way by every scene of this motion picture, giving me one of my best cineastic experiences of the recent time.

She's a very boring super hero.Ah-Nuld Schwarzenegger has a lot of fun playing Mr. Freeze, and we like him the most out of all the characters. But his Mr.Freeze has learned the ways of his character from his 1985 movie Commando ridiculous strength, bad one liners and all. I really don't concur with the director's choice to turn Arnnie into another super strengthed douche.The script writers really don't know these characters very well. Bane, a giant muscular monster fuelled by steroids, was not a stupid buffoon in the comic books. he was a tactical, intelligent foe who was almost Batman's match. Alicia Silverstone's character wasn't even Alfred's nephew in the comics.in the end, it IS as bad as everyone says it is. I hope Batman Begins can make it alright the be a Batman fan again, after this atrocity.*\/**** ","genre":"Action, Fantasy, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"27 January 2004","score":"","review":"  Like The Usual Suspects, this is a movie whose standing is based largely on its initial effect.

I have now seen it twice and to me it is nothing more than a different, but average movie.What bothers me the most is the fact that it is boring. A family moves into a house and weird stuff starts to happen. But it all happens so slowly. What should have been a 90-minute movie has been stretched out to 2 hours. It has its moments.

That may sound silly to you, but visuals are very important to me and The Shining is just plain old ugly. Even the apartment the family is living in before they move into the hotel is white and horrible.

This is a major mind screw of a movie. However, I cannot believe that I still adore this movie, I love the risks it took and that it didn't insult children's intelligence like most movies do. Don Bluth, one of the greatest animators and story tellers of our time, said that kids are more resilient than you would think. That's so true and Return to Oz is a wonderful magical movie that leaves you breathless.Dorothy Gale has become a melancholic child who cannot stop dreaming of the people she met in the magical world of Oz, concerning Aunt Em and Uncle Henry. The two decide to take her to see Doctor Worley, known for his shock therapy treatments. Before going, Dorothy finds a key she believes her friends from Oz sent to her on a shooting star. Aunt Em leaves Dorothy at Dr. Worley's laboratory under the care of Nurse Wilson. As she is taken to have treatment, the lab has a blackout, and Dorothy is saved by a mysterious girl who reveals that some patients have been driven insane by Worley's treatment. The two escape but fall into a river. The blonde girl vanishes underwater and Dorothy returns to Oz. Upon awakening, Dorothy finds her chicken who can now talk named Billina for company. The two discover the ruined Yellow Brick Road, which leads them to the Emerald City, now in ruins, missing its emeralds, and all of its citizens including the Tin Woodman and Cowardly Lion turned to stone.

I loved their relationship, it was beautiful.

Even the main characters in this film declare that they are too precious for this world! HOW PRETENTIOUS!This film is not good. There is a scene in the film where the characters run over a dog in their car. Xavier Red then slits the dogs throat. Does this animal symbolise the viewer? Boy I wished I was that dog.Before a bunch of 1st year university art students start claiming that I just don't get it. I would like to say that many years ago, I was a teenage goth. It has been a very long time since I have worn a fishnet top. With my beer belly now this would not be a good look. However, if I was anything like these people I would have shot myself long ago.I felt like I was watching part of Gregg Araki's own therapy sessions. His sexual fantasies and his own repressed hatred for the rest of society. That is where the film becomes pretentious. He seems to say that he is above everybody. This is actually a common feature in goths. They seem to argue their points on the fact that you are just, like, so bourgeois. They don't realize this is all part of their own identity formation as they are trying to find themselves. They reject their environment to feel superior and different.You can see all of this taking place in this film. Jordon and Amy reject the club. Jordan and Amy also feel contempt for everyone around them. The store owner, the city, the fastfood restaurant staff, the jocks, the media, parking attendants and old people. So once you state that everybody sucks then what do you do?...ummm...I know, lets throw in some violence! Isn't it hilarious when a severed head vomits! Oh my sides! Besides from my sarcasm a similar scene has already been filmed by David Lynch in Wild at Heart. Lynch and John Waters are both influences here.Where is Araki's ear for dialogue? I have not heard dialogue so badly written and then spoken since Attack of the Clones! It is all so contrived! None of the actors seem to be natural. They all overact and the performances are a mess. The films flavor reminded me of the work of Harmony Korine. Korine who I personally think is still growing as a film maker is more talented. Korine's freaks are paraded before us in a completely naturalistic way. All the dialogue uttered in Korines films feels at least partially natural. The actors in Doom all sound like b-movie actors saying lines. I don't think Araki is trying to be camp. It is just pure incompetence. I have seen better acting in my local soap,  Shortland Street. Please James 'it's trippy man' Duval, stay away from acting! This guy is like Keanu Reeves junior and they both disgrace their profession. Also, Rose Mcgowan should stay in Marilyn 'I'm shocking, Really!' Mansons mansion and keep his snake fed. She utters inane lines like 'eat my f**k.' When a character starts using 'totally' many times in a sentence, it is time to tune out and do something else. I just wished that the character Amy would shut up. She was just so whiny and annoying!Duval spends most of his time saying inane things as well. 'Everything is like, so beautiful man!' The characters go on a road trip. Xavier begins to erode these two characters social norms. Xavier is repugnant, which Amy actually says. Xavier kills people and shags both Amy and Jordan. His influence is so much that he influences these characters sexual tastes. The sexual scenarios get more and more out there. So the viewer is treated to Araki's sexual fantasies. Jeez, aren't we lucky? It is just as well that Araki stopped where he did because otherwise we would be returning back too the realms of using chickens like in Pink Flamingos. That is the problem with the film, it goes for shock value but this stuff has already been done! It has also been done with more skill and filmed more explicitly. So the whole thing seems pointless.Araki decides on having no plot. I felt this film would be o.k if it was a comic book aimed at goth teens. I imagine that they would dig it. But then there would be no soundtrack What is the bet that the soundtrack actually did better than film? When a film has to be sold on its soundtrack, well that film is doomed. The Doom Generation has an apt title.Through the film we sense all of Araki's hostility towards mainstream society. You notice with the lack of parental figures in this film. It is almost like that Araki is making a statement about parents not being there for their kids. Not giving the attention and affection that they need. None of them expect their parents to help them when they get into trouble. The characters state that, my parents committed suicide, mine is a drug addict, mine is a Scientologist. Notice the news report, 'commonly worn by homosexuals, satanists and other dangerous groups.' Notice when the frat boys, the guys at the end with the handy pair of garden shears, rape Amy on the American flag to the national anthem music. Notice the fast food restaurant, with the horrendous titles for the meals. Araki isn't vegetarian by any chance? He does not seem to like meat. Notice how he makes fun of people at fast food restaurants by virtually labeling them as rednecks with bad teeth. I observed these moments in the film and thought, 'thats satire?' Araki is just so subtle. The fastfood guy with one arm missing chasing the main characters. Again, oh my sides.Why didn't he just take 15 minutes by coming on camera and declaring that fast food restaurants suck, jocks\/frat boys suck, clubs with idiots asking you for drugs suck, convenience store owners who are pedantic about their smoke free policy suck, rape sucks, having your penis cut off with garden shears sucks and a homophobic America sucks. On all of these points I would agree with him. But then it wouldn't be a pretentious, posing movie would it?Another annoying thing is the cameo factor. Just because some famous people, Heidi Fleiss and Perry Farrell appear in your film does not mean it is going to be any good. This is a cheap attempt to get viewers and street credibility. If Farrell appeared in my film he must like and believe in it! No, he just needed the money. The interior decorating is another factor. Just because you make rooms look surreal and include signs like 'OBEY,' this still does not make your movie cool. Those signs irritated me terribly. Can you be any more heavy handed? Ever heard of symbolism Araki?Finally Araki tries to turn Jordan into Jesus. Being 'white,' he is a pure figure who loves unconditionally. Because of this he needs to be turned into a martyr figure. So Jordan gets the garden sheers and Amy gets raped. I think Xavier is meant to be the snake who imparts knowledge. His knowledge seems to be 'loosen up your sexual boundaries.' Swingers would love this guy. Are we meant to conclude that free love is the answer?  The problem with the last violent scene is that these characters are so badly written that you don't give a damn about any of them. I just wanted the homophobic, gym crazy, frat boys to kill them all so that the film would end. The Doom Generation is quite short but still manages to drag because of its lack of any story.This gets 2 out of 10 from me. What a shallow piece of crap! It has about as much depth as a Skinny Puppy album cover. Gregg Araki is the next Joel Schumacher.

Even the main characters in this film declare that they are too precious for this world! HOW PRETENTIOUS!This film is not good. There is a scene in the film where the characters run over a dog in their car. Xavier Red then slits the dogs throat. Does this animal symbolise the viewer? Boy I wished I was that dog.Before a bunch of 1st year university art students start claiming that I just don't get it. I would like to say that many years ago, I was a teenage goth. It has been a very long time since I have worn a fishnet top. With my beer belly now this would not be a good look. However, if I was anything like these people I would have shot myself long ago.I felt like I was watching part of Gregg Araki's own therapy sessions. His sexual fantasies and his own repressed hatred for the rest of society. That is where the film becomes pretentious. He seems to say that he is above everybody. This is actually a common feature in goths. They seem to argue their points on the fact that you are just, like, so bourgeois. They don't realize this is all part of their own identity formation as they are trying to find themselves. They reject their environment to feel superior and different.You can see all of this taking place in this film. Jordon and Amy reject the club. Jordan and Amy also feel contempt for everyone around them. The store owner, the city, the fastfood restaurant staff, the jocks, the media, parking attendants and old people. So once you state that everybody sucks then what do you do?...ummm...I know, lets throw in some violence! Isn't it hilarious when a severed head vomits! Oh my sides! Besides from my sarcasm a similar scene has already been filmed by David Lynch in Wild at Heart. Lynch and John Waters are both influences here.Where is Araki's ear for dialogue? I have not heard dialogue so badly written and then spoken since Attack of the Clones! It is all so contrived! None of the actors seem to be natural. They all overact and the performances are a mess. The films flavor reminded me of the work of Harmony Korine. Korine who I personally think is still growing as a film maker is more talented. Korine's freaks are paraded before us in a completely naturalistic way. All the dialogue uttered in Korines films feels at least partially natural. The actors in Doom all sound like b-movie actors saying lines. I don't think Araki is trying to be camp. It is just pure incompetence. I have seen better acting in my local soap,  Shortland Street. Please James 'it's trippy man' Duval, stay away from acting! This guy is like Keanu Reeves junior and they both disgrace their profession. Also, Rose Mcgowan should stay in Marilyn 'I'm shocking, Really!' Mansons mansion and keep his snake fed. She utters inane lines like 'eat my f**k.' When a character starts using 'totally' many times in a sentence, it is time to tune out and do something else. I just wished that the character Amy would shut up. She was just so whiny and annoying!Duval spends most of his time saying inane things as well. 'Everything is like, so beautiful man!' The characters go on a road trip. Xavier begins to erode these two characters social norms. Xavier is repugnant, which Amy actually says. Xavier kills people and shags both Amy and Jordan. His influence is so much that he influences these characters sexual tastes. The sexual scenarios get more and more out there. So the viewer is treated to Araki's sexual fantasies. Jeez, aren't we lucky? It is just as well that Araki stopped where he did because otherwise we would be returning back too the realms of using chickens like in Pink Flamingos. That is the problem with the film, it goes for shock value but this stuff has already been done! It has also been done with more skill and filmed more explicitly. So the whole thing seems pointless.Araki decides on having no plot. I felt this film would be o.k if it was a comic book aimed at goth teens. I imagine that they would dig it. But then there would be no soundtrack What is the bet that the soundtrack actually did better than film? When a film has to be sold on its soundtrack, well that film is doomed. The Doom Generation has an apt title.Through the film we sense all of Araki's hostility towards mainstream society. You notice with the lack of parental figures in this film. It is almost like that Araki is making a statement about parents not being there for their kids. Not giving the attention and affection that they need. None of them expect their parents to help them when they get into trouble. The characters state that, my parents committed suicide, mine is a drug addict, mine is a Scientologist. Notice the news report, 'commonly worn by homosexuals, satanists and other dangerous groups.' Notice when the frat boys, the guys at the end with the handy pair of garden shears, rape Amy on the American flag to the national anthem music. Notice the fast food restaurant, with the horrendous titles for the meals. Araki isn't vegetarian by any chance? He does not seem to like meat. Notice how he makes fun of people at fast food restaurants by virtually labeling them as rednecks with bad teeth. I observed these moments in the film and thought, 'thats satire?' Araki is just so subtle. The fastfood guy with one arm missing chasing the main characters. Again, oh my sides.Why didn't he just take 15 minutes by coming on camera and declaring that fast food restaurants suck, jocks\/frat boys suck, clubs with idiots asking you for drugs suck, convenience store owners who are pedantic about their smoke free policy suck, rape sucks, having your penis cut off with garden shears sucks and a homophobic America sucks. On all of these points I would agree with him. But then it wouldn't be a pretentious, posing movie would it?Another annoying thing is the cameo factor. Just because some famous people, Heidi Fleiss and Perry Farrell appear in your film does not mean it is going to be any good. This is a cheap attempt to get viewers and street credibility. If Farrell appeared in my film he must like and believe in it! No, he just needed the money. The interior decorating is another factor. Just because you make rooms look surreal and include signs like 'OBEY,' this still does not make your movie cool. Those signs irritated me terribly. Can you be any more heavy handed? Ever heard of symbolism Araki?Finally Araki tries to turn Jordan into Jesus. Being 'white,' he is a pure figure who loves unconditionally. Because of this he needs to be turned into a martyr figure.

Of course none of this would work without a great director at the helm and Jan de Bont rises to the challenge.

In fact a lot of the film recalls Die Hard with the suspense arising from a plot that is quite simple yet deviously more complex in its execution. The biggest surprise at the time was that Keanu Reeves does wonderfully well in the role of the hero, Jack Tavern. He is charming, yet tough and while he doesn't really have to 'act' here, his performance is well done and he should be proud. Likewise Sandra Bullock in what is really her breakthrough role, even though it is her second major film after having been the female lead in Demolition Man. Her performance has all the hallmarks of her lovely girl next door act and her chemistry with Reeves works well. It is especially funny when he keeps calling her 'mam'.However the film is stolen from everyone's favorite psychopath Dennis Hopper. Brilliantly evil as Howard Payne, Hopper clearly enjoys playing a bad guy who enjoy being a terrorist (the whim of a mad man, I like it). While the role is not of the disturbing variety that Frank Booth is (this is a mainstream film after all), the role is great one and is instantly memorable, as is his death scene.If you have still to watch this film do. It is brilliant and is one of the best Hollywood action films of the nineties. Just don't watch the abysmal sequel.

Even most great novels from the 1930s, or paintings or music, falter down the stretch.We have all the elements of movie thrillers in times to come, to the point of parody. Lone innocent man on the run from something he doesn't understand. Strange woman appears at his doorstep and whispers vague warnings of a deadly plot. Strange woman turns up the next morning with knife protruding from the exact center of her back. Man on the run from the law finds himself bumping into a woman who may be able to help him, if she can get herself to trust him first.It's all very cliché, and even though The 39 Steps gets credit since this was much more original when it was released, we the jaded viewers of today would still find it a tired exercise to watch a film loaded with clichés, whether or not they were novel at the time. But The 39 Steps takes these elements and does strange things to them, playing with audience expectations and throwing a curve. Just when you think something is going to happen, it doesn't.In one funny scene, Robert Donat confronts a milkman while trying to escape his apartment building under the baleful eye of two sinister men. He tells the milkman he needs help, a woman has been murdered in his apartment and now they are after him. The milkman shakes his head. Donat realizes he needs a change of tack. He explains he is a bachelor who has been spending the night with a married lady friend, and one of the two men outside is her husband.Well, why didn't you say so in the first place, the milkman says with a conspiratorial grin, pulling off his white coat so Donat can put it on and get away unnoticed. I only wanted to be told.These curves grow only more clever and outrageous as the show rolls along. And roll it does, with very little stopping for breath. There's one poignant pause, at a crofter's cottage in rural Scotland where the tenant is a nasty, sanctimonious cheat with a sad young wife, a woman of soulful beauty played hauntingly by Peggy Ashcroft, not yet a Dame. Things happen between the Scotsman and Donat, in the usual not-as-you-expect-way, but just as things are looking their bleakest, the woman steps in and saves him, risking apparent cruelty from her husband down the road.Do all the women in London paint their toenails? the Scotsman's wife asks, and Donat's Richard Hanney seems like he'd be one to know. He speaks in a singularly tweedy and under-the-breath way that suggests a sleazy schoolmaster trying to seduce a teenager while her parents sleep in the next room. All this Jack-The-Lad stuff's out the window when the fuzz arrives, and he finds himself up against suspicious sheriffs, an FDR lookalike with a missing digit, and a nagging tune he can't get out of his head. Finally, there's Madeleine Carroll, a woman who gets handcuffed to him and finds herself believing his shaggy dog story against her better judgment.There's so many great scenes in this movie, and a lot of them verge into spoiler country. Best advice here is to see the film for yourself, and see what I mean. But my favorite moment is Hanney's improv stump speech for candidate McCrocodile.

What is for me, the whole thing is but a party for the viewer's eyes to enjoy, you get into Lynch's speedy car and you let him drive you wherever. From the blackbook-killer (who, with his complete surrealism, made me cry my tears out) to the incredibly eerie shots of the dream (weird-faced man) and the melodious Spanish going throughout the film, I've loved every bit of it, and I haven't got a clue of what was the story about.Probably something about a dream; it appears clear to me that the inflexion point lies on the broken Crying song in this glorious creeping moment when the singer faints\/dies\/whatever and the music keeps on playing a dream is over and another dream starts. To me, Diane has killed herself (or has been killed maybe?), well, anyway, she has died, and all the images are but her death dream. I don't say that because it actually makes any sense, but just because it feels like a Death dream to me. I'd bet something valuable that if you go and shoot yourself the last things in your mind would resemble a Lynch movie, just for the heck of it, and just because his sequences are so anguishing, anxious and (for good and for bad) breathtaking. A horrible, surrealistic and sarcastic hallucination? Might be. And if you don't agree with that, which you shouldn't, I'll give you a cool reason to go and watch this film 1. Because you don't need a reason. If you do, it's not your kind of movie. 2.If you like hot girls, here you'll get a few. If you don't, you'll get really nice performances anyway (which is not as pleasing I guess, but it worths the effort anytime), but no you won't get hot guys, which is sad, but not a tragedy after all. And 3...oh well, I'm tired of giving reasons great lights, pretty blue colours, amazing music and a long et cetera.

I was seated unfortunately close to the screen and my professor chose me to serve as a whipping boy- everyone else was laughing, but they weren't within constant eyesight.Let's get it out of the way the Peter Jackson 'Lord of the Rings' films do owe something to the Bakshi film. In Jackson's version of The Fellowship of the Ring, for instance, the scene in which the Black Riders assault the empty inn beds is almost a complete carbon copy of the scene in Bakshi's film, shot by shot. You could call this plagiarism or homage, depending on your agenda. I'm sure the similarities don't stop there. I'm not going to do any research to find out what they are, because that would imply I have some mote of respect for this film. I'm sure others have outlined the similarities- look around.This movie is a complete train wreck in every sense of the metaphor, and many, many people died in the accident. I've decided to list what I can remember in a more or less chronological fashion- If I've left out anything else that offended me it's because I'm completely overwhelmed, confronted with a wealth of failure (and, at high points, mediocrity).*Due to heavy use of rotoscoping, Gandalf is no longer a gentle, wise wizard but a wildly flailing prophet of doom (whose hat inexplicably changes color once or twice during the course of the film).*Saruman the White is sometimes referred to as 'Aruman' during the film, without explanation. He wears purple and red for some mysterious reason.*Sam is flat out hideous. The portrayal of his friendship with Frodo is strangely childlike and unsatisfying. Yes, hobbits are small like children, but they are NOT children.*Merry and Pippin are never introduced--they simply appear during a scene change with a one-sentence explanation. The film is filled with sloppy editing like this.*Frodo, Sam, Pippin and Merry are singing merrily as they skip through along the road. One of the hobbits procures a lute at least twice as large as he is from behind his back--which was not visible before--and begins strumming in typical fantasy bard fashion as they all break into la-la-las. AWFUL.*Aragorn, apparently, is a Native American dressed in an extremely stereotypical fantasy tunic (no pants), complete with huge, square pilgrim belt buckle. He is arguably the worst swordsman in the entire movie--oftentimes he gets one wobbly swing in before being knocked flat on his ass.*The Black Riders appear more like lepers than menacing instruments of evil. They limp everywhere they go at a painfully slow pace. This is disturbing to be sure, but not frightening.*The scene before the Black Riders attempt to cross the Ford of Bruinen (in which they stare at Frodo, who is on the other side on horseback) goes on forever, during which time the Riders rear their horses in a vaguely threatening manner and... do nothing else. The scene was probably intended to illustrate Frodo's hallucinatory decline as he succumbs to his wound. It turns out to be more plodding than anything else.*Gimli the Dwarf is just as tall as Legolas the Elf. He's a DWARF. There is simply no excuse for that. He also looks like a bastardized David the Gnome. It's a crude but accurate description.*Boromir appears to have pilfered Elmer Fudd's golden Viking armor from that Bugs Bunny opera episode. He looks ridiculous.*Despite the similarity to Tolkien's illustration, the Balrog is howl inducing and the least-threatening villain in the entire film. It looks like someone wearing pink bedroom slippers, and it's barely taller than Gandalf. Purists may prefer this Balrog, but I'll take Jackson's version any day.*The battle scenes are awkward and embarrassing. Almost none of the characters display any level of competency with their armaments. I'm not asking for action-packed scenes like those in Jackson's film, but they ARE supposed to be fighting.*Treebeard makes a very short appearance, and I was sorry he bothered to show up at all. Watch the film, you'll see what I mean.Alright, now for the GOOD parts of the film.*Some of the voice acting is pretty good. It isn't that Aragorn SOUNDS bad, he just looks kind of like the Jolly Green Giant.*Galadriel is somewhat interesting in this portrayal; like Tom Bombadil, she seems immune to the Ring's powers of temptation, and her voice actress isn't horrible either.*Boromir's death isn't as heart wrenching as in Jackson's portrayal of the same scene, but it's still appropriately dramatic (and more true to his death in the book, though I don't believe Jackson made a mistake shooting it the way he did).*As my professor pointed out (between whispered threats), the orcs (mainly at Helm's Deep, if I'm correct) resemble the war-ravaged corpses of soldiers, a political statement that works pretty well if you realize what's being attempted.*While this isn't really a positive point about the film, Bakshi can't be blamed for the majority of the failures in this movie, or so I've been told--the project was on a tight budget, and late in its production he lost creative control to some of the higher-ups (who I'm sure hadn't read the books).Let me be clear I respect Bakshi for even attempting something of this magnitude. I simply have a hard time believing he was happy with the final product. Overall, I cannot in any way recommend this blasphemous adaptation of Tolkien's classic trilogy even for laughs, unless you've already read the books and have your own visualizations of the characters, places and events. I'm sure somebody, somewhere, will pick a copy of this up in confusion; if you do, keep an open mind and glean what good you can from it.
