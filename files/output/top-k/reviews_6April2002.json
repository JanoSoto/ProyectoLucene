[{"date":"6 April 2002","score":"","review":"  Shrek was a marvelous delight for anybody to have the privilege to see it. The movie was ideal in length and was a perfect spoof on several fairytales. From the creators of Antz, this movie brought smooth, computer-rendered animation onto the big screen, and definitely deserved the Academy Award it won.With an all-star cast of voicists (Mike Myers, John Lithgow, Eddie Murphy, and Cameron Diaz), this movie easily shows the years of work they put into it. I loved this movie as a film and as a DVD, and I recommend it strongly, if anybody had not seen it already. It is clear and original, although taking much of a plot from other fairytales. I would look for an upcoming Shrek 2 to be nothing less than dazzling.

","genre":"Animation, Adventure, Comedy"},{"date":"6 April 2002","score":"","review":"  With the success of Shrek and Monsters, Inc. Fox has decided to give their brand of computer-based animation a try. Unfortunately, it doesn't come close to the aforementioned films. While it is cute and kids will most likely enjoy it, it's not of the caliber of its competitors and doesn't seem to reach its full potential.   First time director Chris Wedge does well keeping the film rolling along at an ADD-acceptable pace, but the overall feel of the movie isn't as fun as it looks in the previews. The voices are provided by B-listers Ray Romano, Denis Leary, and John Leguizamo, who do an OK job, but don't seem to make the characters loveable enough.   The opening sequence (which is what you may have seen in previews last year) with the little furry animal and the acorn is classic, but the dialogue-heavy sequences aren't quite as funny. The plot isn't too bad, but the sequence of events is pretty predictable. While no one is expecting anything groundbreaking, there's nothing really new here.  This is one that is worth taking the kids to, but will still be OK to wait for video as well. It's not too adult and not too childish either. This film wasn't made for critics, though. It was made for kids so in that respect it's good. Through the eyes of a child, this one is pretty entertaining. Go ahead and check it out if it looks good to you (or your kids).
