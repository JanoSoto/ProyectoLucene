Of course I got bored when I first saw it (being an average 9 year old) but when I saw it for the second time a month ago I was truely amazed and touched!The movie is about four regular guys from Erie, PA that become a success over night in their band. The movie stars five amazing and brilliant people. The people who play each member act as if they really have the personality of their charactor.There is Guy Patterson (Tom Everet Scott). He plays the drummer of the band. He did a great job on acting as if he was really a drummer. There's one problem with his charactor, the whole Spartacus thing. It's hard to comprehend.There's also Lenny (Steve Zahn) the goofy of the wall lead guitarist. He is so hilarious in this movie. I couldn't keep from laughing.Jimmy (Johnathan Schaech) is the reluctant one. I really think Johnathan did a good job at portraying a lead singer. I did not like the charactor of Jimmy though. He ended up being a real pain in the butt at the end.Let's not forget Liv Tyler. She did an excellent job at being a girl-next-door. I enjoyed her character greatly.Last but not least (definately not in my book) is the bassplayer (Ethan Embry). This had to be my favorite charactor in the whole movie. I like the fact he played a shy guy. He seemed so innocent.I think Tom Hanks did a wonderful job at writing, directing, and co staring in this magical movie. Bravo Mr. Hanks, and bravo to Tom Everett Scott, Steve Zahn, Jonathan Scaech, and Ethan Embry. Anyone that says they don't like this movie I'll have to say, Your talking gibberish...

Milestones ahead of Anderson's last film (Boogie Nights - which was good, but not great), I was totally unprepared for one of the most interesting cinematic experiences of my life (especially from a movie coming out of Hollywood.)  The movie is three hours long, yet I could have gone on watching it for three more hours because the tragedy of the different characters was so interesting, and Anderson's cinematic, rather than literary style of editing the film made it even more compelling to watch. This movie was vastly more imaginative than American Beauty, which I found pretentious and difficult to sit through.Whether or not Hollywood will financilly support Anderson to keep on making films like this remains to be seen.  I now understand why Tom Cruise wanted to do this picture, even though his role was only one of many supporting roles.I also want to mention that the brilliant original score and the songs worked beautifully with the storyline.Perhaps I should have expected that the man who made Boogie Nights would have the guts to make an even more daring movie.

The transitions from location to location are beautifully constructed; a series of intimate painterly portraits, introducing you to the vulnerable underbelly of each city. This also applies to the cut scenes between dialogue ... at times I was drooling! The characters are generally so well drawn that we can even forgive Winona Ryder's unconvincing tom-boy mechanic. Each twenty minute story is just long enough to engross and short enough to leave you happy that you didn't waste your time and you're ready for the next. And there's real comedy too ... farce, circus buffoonery and even belly laughs. I must admit, by the last story I did begin to tire a little of the format. It all finishes with not so subtle pathos (which I resisted) which highlights the unrelenting pain of life. Absolutely beautiful. Highly recommended.

This alone makes the film worth seeing, as it explodes the myth, fostered no doubt by their PT Barnum manager, Malcolm McLaren, that the whole project was an exercise in cynical nihilism and money grubbing. As the band members tell it, nothing could have been further from the truth. I believe them.The film is cobbled together in large part from 2 previous Sex Pistols documentaries, Rock 'n' Roll Swindle, (a McLaren project also directed, ironically enough, by F&F director Julie Temple) and D.O.A, plus clips from BBS television and elsewhere that try to locate the Pistols in the political and social climate that spawned them. This  effort, to give the Pistols a historical context, is by far the most valuable part of the film for those trying to understand how a bunch of working class stiffs, who could barely play their instruments, and who only released one album, could set off an explosion that reverberates in the music world--if increasingly faintly--even today.Best part of the film footage from their last, secret gig at a palace in a working class district (they had been banned from appearing anywhere in England) before embarking on their ill-fated US tour. It consists of two performance on Christmas Day, benefiting the families of striking local firefighters, who had been out of work for many months. The attendees consist of the local lads and lasses, none of whom are punk in any apparent sense of the term.Before the Pistols performed, everyone eats Sex Pistols cake and ice cream; Never Mind the Bollocks shirts are stretched over the pubescent bodies of every bobby soxer. Then, after a thank you from the emcee, the Pistols launch into the searing Bodies, its sarcastic refrain sung from the point of view of an aborted fetus (I'm not an animal!\/I'm an abortion...). All the boppers dance like it's a sock hop, with the difference that everyone gleefully throws leftover desserts at one another. Steve Jones is shown playing guitar with his face covered in cake icing, beaming. In his reminiscence about the gig, Rotten grows wistful, saying it was easily their best memory as a band, and the last good one before it all fell apart.I never knew the guys were such sentimentalists.It's hard to believe that there once was a time when rock music could actually matter, when it was possible to actually escape the commodified rebellion that now sells Budweiser, Nike, and SUVs, when it was possible, however briefly to scare the pants of the political establishment. Young pop music lovers who swallow the meretricious rebellion of rap or grunge--whose self-important lyrics and idiotically monotonous rhythms make their authors rich off the  weekly allowances of white middle class kids whose idea of rebellion is big loud subwoofers in the Corolla Daddy bought them for their 16th birthday--might profit from getting a glimpse of the Real Thing.The rest of us, who were lucky enough to have been there when history was made, and who can still recall the opening chords of Anarchy in the UK blasting all traces of More Than a Feeling and Take It Easy out of our speakers cabinets and into the first circle of music Hell where they always belonged, can enjoy the film for what it teaches us about the power of ordinary, thoroughly obnoxious people to make their own history, and ours.Another thing I learned from the film if Tom Cruise were a junkie, he would look just like Sid Vicious.
