When I first heard about this film, I wasn't interested. Sure everyone was yacking about the deep social issues it presents and blah blah blah.  I didn't care.  Not even the taboo factor (if, considering this day and age, there really is one -- yeah I know lots of people still find it shocking) was enough to make me want to see this movie.  Then along comes my girlfriend and writes to me about how wonderful and moving this film is and how believable Hilary Swank is as a guy.  Usually my girlfriend is right but this time she was dead wrong.  I was bored after only five (yes, FIVE) minutes.  I figured, maybe it's just taking a little long to get started so I sat through another ten minutes.  By then I knew I hated this movie. Hilary Swank is in no way a convincing male (not just because of her obvious physical features but she's too feminine when trying to behave masculine). So I left the film on and went to the bathroom to shave.  After about another 10 minutes (I had no shaving cream), I went back to the movie.  It was still crap.  So I turned it off and popped in Bringing Out The Dead (by far a much superior movie).  I know this movie was based on actual events but I don't care.  Garbage is garbage no matter what it's based on. I know people will REALLY hate me for trashing this movie but I don't care. When I told my girlfriend how much I hated it she was in shock.  In all honesty, I sorta felt I was treating this film harshly since I had just viewed a movie that really spoke to me (again, Bringing Out The Dead) just prior to viewing this one.  Then again, Bringing Out The Dead is a slow paced love it\/hate it movie so perhaps the comparison isn't so bad.  After all, wouldn't Bringing Out The Dead be the obvious loser between the two? Yet it wasn't.  I may try to watch the whole movie someday (with ALOT of black coffee and LOTS of soda and candy) but I honestly don't see why I should bother.For those of you that may accuse me of being sexist or god knows what, I actually have liked so-called chick-flicks to the point that I believe there is no such thing.  I might also add that sexual choices and differences do not offend me in any way.Also, for those who think I don't know my ass from my elbow, if you truly want to see a female actor playing a convincing male watch Linda Hunt's performance of Billy Kwan in `The Year of Living Dangerously.'

This movie had restored my faith in american horror movies once again, something i thought it wouldn´t happen in a million years, after having to put up with endless Freddy Krugger, Jason and countless horror teen movies. I was totally convinced that Hollywood had just abandoned adult scary horror forever.

By the way, check the DVD for more on this if you still think the plot is wrong, maybe this will convince you.Anyway, what more can i say ?

I guess the particular writer must have been deaf and blind. Hey, I am all for equal opportunity - but as a movie critic?I did finally see it (almost being dragged along by friends) and spent the next 2 hours trying gasping for air because I was laughing so hard. Besides being funny (the description of the high society around Chris aka gorgeous Catharina Zeta-Jones almost saw me on the floor), it is also a very musical movie (as if the title wasn't a dead give-away) but even more so about typical men in our times and their troubles with relationships, love and sex. Men beware, from time to time you will recognize yourself in this piece - and you will not like it!On the other hand the whole story, the whole movie is centered around John Cusack - he not only acts (fabulously as usual I have to admit), he also directs and writes bits of it.

After years of dealing with an abusive and sexually disturbed father (Savage) and being protector to his mother (Kinski) and younger brothers, he is given a chance by his wealthy girlfriend to get away.  The only problem is, guilt, love and fear for his family makes him stay.  Upon realizing Jimmy is growing up and has been snooping around where he shouldn't, his father decides its time to reveal some startling news to him.  The shocking news makes Jimmy more desperate than ever to tear himself and his family away from his father before something worse happens.  At the same time, a woman named Doris (Knight) appears in town, and she reveals to the police why she is searching for the West family.  The police lend their help, but she ultimately takes matters into her own hands when she shows up at the West's trailer.  The ending is not at all what one would expect and many questions are left unanswered, leaving the viewer wishing for more explanation.I was sorry to see that this movie was not highly publicized because I thought the acting was intense by all.  Having forgotten that I first saw Phillippe (along with John Savage) in White Squall, this was really the first time I saw him in a leading role and, might I say, what a performer he is.  As for Savage and Kinski, one of the reasons I watched this movie was to see them together again as I had enjoyed them so much in Maria's Lovers.  It was nice to see the chemistry still there.  Admittedly, some of the sex scenes are a bit harsh and you need to see this movie more than once to really understand it, but don't let that stop you from seeing it at all.

Mr. Singer, cast and crew, I apologize, I shall never doubt you again (except for that idiot Halle Berry, thank God she barely has any dialogue here). Actually, this movie is much better than it has any right to be. The potential for embarrassment was huge. We have a director who has never directed a commercial hit-special effects film before, a cast of mostly unknowns and a bunch of super heroes in leather suits with goofy powers. And lets not forget a final battle taking place on top of the Statue of Liberty. But I'll be a son of a gun if Singer didn't do it, and do it well.After an opening sequence that is  as moving and dramatic as anything I've seen all year, I knew I was in for something special. I've been reading the book for about 15 years now, so I'm one of those types that the media was focusing on as the movie opened up around the world. Yes, it's all true, we are all pale friendless virgins who obsess over every little detail of the book (sadly, this IS true for many of the books readers. Comics just seem to bring out the anal-retentive types). So it's safe to say that I had some interest in how the movie would come out. Wolverine is my all time favourite character, and after seeing this, all I can say is that Hugh Jackman IS Wolverine! It was uncanny. I just sat there thinking, This guy is Wolverine! Could this be any cooler?. Others may not have this reaction, mind you. If Jackman plays his cards right after this, he could become a major star in Hollywood. Keep an eye on this guy.Something that really surprised me was how well the relationship between Xavier and Magnus was handled. The few scenes that they share are some of my favourites. McKellen and Stewart are the two thespians of the cast, so this should be no surprise, but they captured the unusual friendship they share very well. Magneto is and always will be the Malcolm X to Professor Xavier's Martin Luther King in the fight for peace between mutants and humans. They other villains have mostly non-speaking roles, but they do their jobs well. I hope Ray Park fans noticed the little homage he did to Darth Maul in one scene. Cute. The good guys get a little more screen time, the standouts being Jackman, Stewart and young Anna Paquin who is adorable as the cursed Rogue. She's a scene stealer in this one, and the relationship she has with Wolverine is very sweet (a part played by Kitty Pryde and then Jubilee in the comic). Famke Janssen provides sparks (and is easy on the eyes. Yum!), and James Marsden is pretty cool as Cyclops, a character who is usually hard to do anything with. I also thought the scene involving Xavier's journey via Cerebro to the psi-plane was very visually interesting. They took something that had always been rather obscure in the comics and made it look very simple yet fascinating on screen.No real complaints here. The third act leaves a little something to be desired (I thought the end battle was maybe a little unspectacular), but otherwise this was great. The movie has the same problem that the book often faces, which is, how do we get rid of Xavier before the final battle?, because when you think about it, when you have the most powerful psi on the planet on your side the rest of your team seems a little redundant.

It's all about a vampire who tells his life story (the whole two hundred years he has been a vampire), and is this fact the one who made me like this movie more than any other vampires movie.The acting was very good, with a remarkable performance by Kirsten Dunst. It makes me sad to see the lack of recognition that Dunst got. Considering she was only 11 years old when she made this film, her acting is great. Her facial movements are at all time good, and the way she said her dialogs made it look almost real. Tom Cruise got everyone's attention with his performance, even though Brad Pitt did a great job.The make-up was fantastic (nothing is fantastic actually, but this make-up was close to it). The only think that wasn't very good was Louis' (Pitt) hair in certain scenes, and Armand's (Banderas) hair also, which, in my opinion, looked awful. Lestat's (Cruise) outfit was excellent, and his golden hair looked better than Pitt's.The color of the eyes that both Cruise and Pitt had made them look more real, and I really enjoyed the fact that the vampires in this movie looked just like normal people, there was no way of noticing any difference, and in this film the vampires kill their victims where nobody can see them. In other films the vampires just arrive to a place where they start killing people for fun and everybody can see that (that is how the slayers always get there and end up killing every vampire on the scene).The film's script was great. The idea of putting some much images from the past, and so little from the present was good.This film breaks some of the rules in vampire movies. How did Louis killed all the vampires in Paris?

In old vampire films this methods didn't work.As Armand said, Louis was a vampire with a human soul. He felt guilty after killing a human, and for a long time he was surviving by eating rats and other animals. But with Lestat's influence Louis became just a bit more aggressive, I mean, he cared less to kill a person.

He had a chance to help him, in 1988, but he did nothing. Well, at least at the end Lestat became the 'old' Lestat again, and he would do to Christian Slater (person who taped Louis' story) the same thing he did to Louis about 200 years earlier.I rated this movie with a 9 out of 10, it's pretty good, and as I said, a bit different from every vampire movie.

The person trying to hold on to her, just two rungs below, is somehow immune to the forces of nature trying to extract everything else from the cave.

But no, they tried to play it straight and all we are left with is an unbelievable series of set-pieces that increasingly strain credulity, until the final moment, when our southern heroine suddenly drives across the entire country to find true love with her jilted lover up in Yankee Maine.The only reason I gave this two stars and not one, is the great character acting by this ensemble.

Yet there is one catch  If Duce wrecks the place, he's dead meat!  Unfortunately, he does end up wrecking the place, including Antoine's one of a kind, thousand dollar fish tank.   To make ends meet, Duce must now come up with a way to patch things up.  To do that, Duce takes the job as a gigolo with the help of T.J. Hicks (Eddie Griffin) and Claire (Gail O'Grady).  During his rather short journey as a gigolo, Duce meets a few interesting clients - Tina who is taller than almost every man in town. - Carol who just cannot stay awake for even a second. - Ruth who suffers severly from torette syndrome. - Jabba Lady who is ten times his size. - And Kate (Arija Bareikis) who ends up being the girl of his dreams.Yet during his short streak as a male gigolo, Duce has another big problem on his hands...being wrongly accused for sleeping with Chuck Fowler's (played by William Forsythe) wife, Elaine (Jacqueline Obradors).All I can say about this movie is thisIt's definately not brilliant, and in a way, it's stupid, but that's okay.  It's a real hilarious comedy with some really funny moments....ESPECIALLY when you meet Duce's clients!  Those of course are the more stronger parts of the film.  And yes, there are the weak points.  Duce Bigalow isn't one of the best movies I ever seen, and I cannot gauruntee that this is one of the best comedies you'll ever see!  There are a few really weak parts in the film that I thought were pointless like the mini parody from The Matrix between Rob Schneider, Oded Fehr, and Gail O'Grady...well, you'll see what I mean!!!I liked this movie...and I CAN gauruntee that if you love comedies, you'll love this one too!!! ) ","genre":"Comedy, Romance"},{"date":"10 August 2000","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  ******SPOILERS********Okay there was a storm; a pretty major storm in 1991 and 6 fishermen died out there. That part of the movie was true but the most intense and best parts of the movie are complete fiction. What happened to the fishermen? Nobody knows this. Petersen and his writer come up with an action adventure flick that works. The action is exciting. We care enough about the characters to make it interesting. The special effects are amazing. Wow! Can you imagine being out at sea in a storm like that? I wouldn't need to drown, I would have a heart attack.However there are problems. The dialogue is rubbish and the director fails to make any of the relationship's any bit touching. Mark Wahlberg (impressive) and Diane Lane's (not so impressive) relationship gets the most screen time but she is a thinly drawn character that we don't care for. George Clooney gives a fine performance as he underplays the role of the Skipper beautifully but his so-called relationship with Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is much like their sea adventure; a disaster. Were they lovers? Were they friends? Her tears at the end suggests the former. Also Bugsy's relationship is laughable. He meets a woman the night before he leaves and we are expected to believe that because they barely spoke one night that she is in love with him and she is going to miss him for eternity. PLEASE!This film is based on a true story. We are told this at the beginning and though the word based must be taken into consideration, I was disappointed that nobody survived because 75% of the movie takes place out on that boat and there is no chance in hell that we know what honestly happened out there.** (out of four) ","genre":null},{"date":"10 August 2000","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  ******SPOILERS********Okay there was a storm; a pretty major storm in 1991 and 6 fishermen died out there.
