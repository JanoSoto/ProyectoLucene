The crowning achievement of Disney Studios, one of Walt Disney's personal favourites, a film that spent almost three decades in the making, an unquestionable classic that has withstood the test of time seemingly without effort, multi-Oscar-winning success story, beloved by children all around the world, legendary, and so much more.And the funny thing is, I only saw it as an adult. Somehow I had slipped straight through my childhood without seeing this film. I had heard about it, of course, but a copy of it had never fallen on my lap. Until I grew up and decided to fix this hole in my education. And you know what? It worked. Probably just as well as had I seen it as a child. Perhaps even better, because I could understand all the nuances at once. And it's such a deep movie, such a passion project, that there's probably a lot that I also missed and only get when I see it a second time.But, as a new viewer, I can say right now that it's one of those perfect film you're privileged to encounter every now and then. The acting is splendid, from the child actors to the father to Dick Van Dyke's Bert to the breakthrough performance of Julie Andrews as the eponymous Mary Poppins herself. And she's the main reason without which this film could never have worked. Luckily Walt Disney had discovered her on stage and offered her her very first film role, convinced that no one else could do the character justice. And I quite agree.It's also a beautiful film in a way only a Disney film can be. Everything from painted London backgrounds to animation blended seamlessly into the life-action, it's all vivid, timeless and gorgeous to look at. All the dance numbers, little touches and the whole feeling of it is just great.Furthermore, it just might be the best film score by The Sherman Brothers. And that's saying a lot. But that's how I feel. Every single song leaves you humming it for weeks, every one fits the scene perfectly and all of them are a great mix of catchy lyrics, clever wordplays, great melodies and phenomenal range. The songs can range from cheerful little ditties to atmospheric melancholy without missing a single beat.If it seems like I'm praising this film to high heavens, that's because I am. I fell love with this film instantly and I regret not having seen it as a child. It jumped straight to the top of my favourite Disney films, if not the top of my favourite films in general.

I was struck by the many creative elements employed in the picture, like Alfredo's (Philippe Noiret) decision to broadcast a movie on the side of a building and how the mother's crocheting unraveled as she went to answer the door for the returning Salvatore near the end of the picture. Earlier, when Salvatore\/Toto was still a child and anxious about his father returning from the War, his mother's response was It takes years to go there (Russia), years to come back. But then when it was confirmed that the father died in the War, the pair pass by an advertisement for 'Via Col Vento' - Gone With the Wind. For young Toto, it was as if his father never even existed.I also got a big kick out of the parish priest Father Adelfio (Leopoldo Trieste), who deemed himself the final arbiter of holiness and good taste in censoring every movie scene that dared to show intimacy between a man and a woman. Doesn't everyone know someone who takes this moral high ground? As a somewhat humorous aside, I had an aunt like that once, who made similar judgments because of her upbringing and religion. Before she passed away, she left me some money which I used to purchase an artist's rendering of a female super-hero, something she would not have approved of. I swear, for the first few weeks I had it displayed with other pieces of art, every morning it would be slightly askew from it's original position, like she was disapproving from beyond and letting me know. I kid you not.What's truly magical about the film though, is the special relationship developed between Alfredo and his young ward Toto, how he takes him under his wing and nurtures the boy's talents and inspires him to move away from Giancaldo to make his own way in the world. With his blindness, Alfredo sees better than Toto himself that his job as projectionist at the cinema is only temporary and that he must make more of himself.There are so many nuances in the film that it would be impossible for me to discuss them all here, in fact it takes repeated viewings of the movie to catch the many insights Tornatore provides. He constructs his story with little hints of what leads to the cleverest of conclusions when Salvatore watches the reel that Alfredo leaves for him upon his passing, a touching commentary on life and love that the old man conveys to his former student as a keepsake and reminder of their time together.

The other is Neil Jordan ('The Crying Game'), a filmmaker who is never makes a conventional movie. He always has a nice twist or turn up his sleeve.The reality is what makes this film work. We sense the day to day boredom and the horror that comes with being a creature of the night that must kill to survive and can never grow old.The story begins in the present as a 200 year-old vampire named Louis (Brad Pitt) grants an interview to a journalist (Christian Slater). His story begins sometime in the late 18th century. Why have all vampires been born in the Victorian era? Aren't there any that were born a caveman or at least during the renaissance.Louis it bitten by a fearsome vampire named Lestat (Tom Cruise) and the movie follows his devastation as he tries to come to terms with what he must do in order to live. The two travel from city to city feeding off the living. At one point Lestat bites a little girl named Claudia and her story is one of the saddest and most potent element of the film.The choice of Tom Cruise as Lestat was not met with much warmth. I, for one, liked his performance here. Cruise has always been an actor willing to let himself look like a jerk but in this one he puts his looks in check. He slips into the character rather well and it never feels like a character role.But the performance that I was most struck by was that of Kirsten Dunst as Claudia a twelve-year-old who lives her life as a vampire and can never grow up. Her character is positively Shakespearean. Dunst plays a twelve-year-old but we sense that inside her is a woman much older and wiser. We sense that inside this young body the mind of an adult who is living the nightmare of not only being a Vampire but an endless childhood in which she can never experience life.The reality of the world of these three characters is brought to life by a brilliant set design by Dante Feretti. I especially loved an underground stone nest with holes in the walls for sleeping quarters that resemble and insect hive. The gloomy cinematography by Phillipe Roussellot ('A River Runs Through It') gives us the smoky, dim existence of a life lived at night.Many critics complained the 'Interview With the Vampire' was slow and dull. I found that its leisure paced worked in putting me into the reality with which these creatures are faced. Because of this the movie isn't heavy on plot. It is about a grim reality that goes on day after day, year after year, century after century living by a horrible code of survival.

It was too confusing and I didn't like the story very much but then again, I was much younger than I am now when I first watched this. Recapping yesterday, I was blown away by the film's inventiveness and intelligence while still remaining an absolute peach of a movie. It's smarter and funnier than I remembered and puts up a strong case for being the best of the lot. The problem I have with it is the same with any film that features the future - it's only as contemporary as the vision at the time and seeing as we're just a few months away from 2015, I'm not expecting flying cars to appear outside my flat any time soon! No sooner had Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) returned to 1985 and his girlfriend Jennifer (Elizabeth Shue) when mad scientist Emmett Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) reappears in the time-travelling DeLorean, albeit with a few modifications. Travelling into the future, the Doc is distraught to find out what happens to Marty's family when things begin to go wrong and is determined to use Marty & Jennifer to prevent disaster. But in the future, the elderly Biff Tannen (Thomas F Wilson) realises the potential of the time machine and goes back to his younger self with an almanac of sporting results with the intention of getting his younger self to make a fortune, changing the time-line and erasing the 1985 Marty and the Doc know forever. Their only hope is to go back to when Biff received the almanac - November 12th, 1955 which was the day of the school dance when Marty's parents met (and of course, when the majority of the first film was set) - and get it back, without interrupting the events of the other Marty and Doc. Got that? Back To The Future Part II is that rare film, the middle of a trilogy that feels like a story on its own instead of simply filling the gap between parts one and three. The film is really driven by Lloyd as Doc Brown, fuelling the story with his own manic hyperactivity and making sure that you don't take things too seriously (like plot holes). It remains just as entertaining as the first, if not more so - the moments when this film interacts with the first are so magical that you give up looking for the ropey effects and just go with it. The effects have naturally dated somewhat but at no point does the film feel artificial. You can follow and believe the film's complex plot despite the effects, especially when the characters go over certain details to help you out! And it's funny too once the hellish vision of the alternative 1985 has disappeared, though it does rely on replaying certain scenes and gags from the first film for added effect such as Lorraine (Lea Thompson) wiping Marty's brow again. Hint for film makers - jokes are rarely funny when you hear or see them more than once! But minor niggles aside, this is much better than I had previously given it credit for. Fun and perfect for families (if you can excuse the odd bit of bad language), it acts as a reminder of just how good director Robert Zemeckis is when he's on form. My personal favourite is the last film (due to a preference for the Wild West setting) but this is an equally strong showing for our favourite time-travelling heroes. It's ambitious, epic and an real treat that anyone can enjoy, even if it naturally looks a little rough in places. After all, we've nearly caught the trilogy up in real life and I don't see flying cars and clothes that dry themselves on my street.

Orlando goes back to SOCIETY, her new gender shoehorns her into a discriminatory reality reeks of scornful male chauvinism and she refuses the proposal from Archduke Harry (Wood). In SEX, at the dawn of industrial revolution, she meets the liberty-pursuing American Shelmerdine (Zane), they engage a spiritually sensual relationship against all odds.

Swinton is unambiguously captivating to play out her androgynous physique, extracts the otherworldliness out of the 400-year time-span, her attention-grabbing stare and utterance intentionally break the fourth wall and deliver the gist of each chapter, as if we were watching a seven-act play, only with more detailed and vivid tableaux.

Brendan Fraser seemed to have been around forever without making an impact in anything till The Mummy but as shown there, he is a very capable leaving man. Despite the fact it had been 13 years since her acting debut I still think of Hurley as the girlfriend of Hugh Grant. Who stole all the media attention at the premier of his movie Four Weddings and a Funeral in that black Versace dress held together with gold safety pins.

When Marty went to Dr. Emmett L.

Marty was accidentally sent back to 1955 where he meets his parents when they were teenagers. Marty interrupted their first meeting and now he has to try to get them back together. Marty and Doc get into series of unfortunate events. At the end of the movie Doc again gets Marty to go on another adventure when he tell Marty and Jennifer that they have to solve a problem with their kids. Society plays a big part in this film. The differences between 1985 and 1955 cultural is that in 1955 the teenage culture just started to forge its own identity. In the movie George is a wimp then with Marty's help he turns into a stronger person which makes him a confident writer with determination. This point is that if you put your mind to it you can accomplish anything, which is still how it should be.
