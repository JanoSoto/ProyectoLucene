Maybe a 12-year-old girl wouldn't catch it, but just based on that scene alone I wouldn't take a daughter of mine to see Josie & the Pussycats. But all-in-all it is a sufficiently-amusing roast of the sad state of music groups today (which don't even deserve to be called bands because that word denotes that they can play their own instruments) that a jaded thirty-year-old like myself could enjoy the rest of the movie, sans daughter, if it had more bits like that. I also couldn't help but notice that towards the end of the movie, a few expletives get tossed out as well. While it's certainly not enough swearing to hold a candle to the non-stop stream of profanities found in a PG-13-rated Kevin Smith movie, it's just enough that, again, it's not something fit for children.But most of Josie & the Pussycats is sugar-coated, smut-free kiddie fare, with nothing more risque than an open-mouthed kiss or two. The plot consists of a simple rags-to-riches Cinderella storyline and is populated by archetypical characters that haven't got much more depth than their Hanna-Barbera cartoon counterparts. One gets the distinct impression that this was a tale intended for girls who still have an active Barbie doll collection. For instance, Melody is a twentysomething-year-old whose internal monologue consists of singing If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands! to herself. Then there's all the childish humor and jokes that are way to obvious to be deemed clever by an adult, such as the running product-placement gag as well as several scenes where a character, in a fit of smarm, decides to stop the flow of the film by breaking the 4th wall.So what were directors Debbie and Harry trying to accomplish here? They made a movie that is haphazardly marketed towards girls somewhere in the pre-to-post bubblegum-popping teeny-bopper age demographic, and yet they actually expect those very same space cadets to appreciate the movie as it mocks them and their shallow tastes in music? The movie would've been better off trying to appeal to the cynical generation-X Metallica fans that wind up beating the daylights out of DuJour.Having said all that, there is one major aspect of the movie I have to praise the Pussycats' songs. 3 Small Words, Pretend to Be Nice, and Spin Around, are a lot of fun to listen to. These tunes fuse pop and rock together with a remarkable smoothness, having just enough of an edge to get me shaking my head and doing the white-man's-overbite, yet incorporating just enough pop flavor to make the experience qualify as a guilty pleasure. If music groups today were fueled by the innovativeness and sheer spunk of the Pussycats rather than the pre-processed, mass-produced, corporate-choreographed You-go-girl! formula of Eden's Crush and Destiny's Child, you might see a few of us cynical generation-Xers standing in line to pick up the latest top 10 hits along with the teeny-boppers, rather than fantasizing about kicking the crap out of Justin Timberlake as we lay back listening to Dark Side of the Moon for the ten-thousandth time.

This movie seemed like one big cliche with psychobabble. I think if a sequel was going to be made, they should have went with the now even more footage was discovered buried in the woods storyline and have the 3 main actors from the first one go back to film new scenes with the cameras. Of course they would be scenes from before the first guy went missing, then the house etc... or something along those lines.Hopefully Blair Witch 3 will be better.

And when I heard that after making the first 20 minutes of film they ran out of budget, I thought They're not gonna make it....But here I am, commenting Final Fantasy The Spirits Within, still astonished because of the film. I must say that I really enjoyed the whole movie from the beginning until the end. I'm a fan of japanese cartoon movies (anime), and I was never expecting an anime plot in this production (of course the writer-director is Hironobu Sakaguchi, creator of the games, but the film is also US).Let's point out the good and bad things of the film- Incredible animation I don't know which is best, Shrek or FinalFantasy, but one thing is sure both are incredible. 10 years before that was impossible to do, and now they are creating a movie without actors (only the voices P), totally digital. Using the MOTION-CAPTURE technique, SQUARE has achieved another level of reality. The weak point of the animation would be the face of the characters. It's very difficult to create a virtual human being, because we are so accostumed to see people that you know, for example, that Aki is not real, no matter her very expensive hair ).- Brilliant plot I found the story line quite interesting, with good rythm. It's like any US futuristic film plot, but with the japanese style.- Similarities with other movies we found several things in the film that are very similar to other movies. For example, the character Jean is exactly like Vazquez in Aliens. Also the final scene is quite similar to Mononoke Hime.You will leave the cinema with a sensation of worth paying for watching the film. I think I will purchase the Sound track...

If you haven't seen it, do everything to get a hold of it!! There are only two things that keep me from giving it a full 10 1 It is still just a comedy, it hasn't really got a captivating story to tell.
