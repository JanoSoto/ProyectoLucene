[{"date":"21 July 2007","score":"","review":" This is a magnificent achievement for an animated film because if you examine the basic plot and setting, it seems like a mere film made only for young children.

But what it also has is the traits of a great movie that you usually don't see in an animated film like this. Shrek is full of colorful animation, the actors providing the voices are perfect in their roles, and the movie is developed and made into a way where it becomes entirely suitable for audience members of all ages. It's not too childish, but too intense and inappropriate for the children. Yet it's not too simple and immature for the older generation as well. In fact, it's not immature at all. It's just an effective film for the entire family that really works out well.Shrek is also one of the few movies that fall under the comedy genre that I would really consider to be a compelling motion picture feature.

He hasn't many features under his belt, but that's because of the effort he invests in his projects. His films take years to complete. Selick's trademark as a director is his love of stop-motion animation, where hand-crafted figures are manipulated an inch at a time. Its a lengthy, time-consuming process that requires a great deal of patience, but in all the films he's made, his perseverance has paid off, and he's turned out some truly stunning work.Although The Nightmare Before Christmas is credited as a Tim Burton film, it was directed by Selick. Together they created a breathtaking world, unlike any I've ever seen before or since. Selick then moved on to the adaptation of James and the Giant Peach, another excellent film. Both were box-office flops sadly, and Selick continues to struggle to find funding for his films as a result. And now we have Monkeybone, a film that attempts to merge stop-motion with live-action.Of Selick's films so far, Monkeybone feels the least satisfying. Maybe because it doesn't quite have the intelligence he brought to his previous work. This is pitched at a much more juvenile level. Brendan Fraser plays Stu Miley, a cartoonist who is the creator of Monkeybone, a wacky wisecracking chimp. After Stu gets in a car crash, he slips into a coma.And winds up in a bizarre buffer-zone between the land of the living and the dead. Populated by strange creatures of all kinds, even Stu's creation Monkeybone is here as a nightclub act. If Stu ever wants to wake up, he has to get an exit pass from Death (Whoopi Goldberg) to return to the waking world. Monkeybone helps him get one, but double-crosses him at the last moment, uses the pass to escape, wakes up in full control of Stu's body, where he wreaks havoc.There's quite a clever idea at the heart of Monkeybone. A figment of your imagination made flesh that tries to take over your life. But although Henry Selick can work marvels when it comes to the animated world, he seems less sure of himself when it comes to live action. When Selick directed James and the Giant Peach, the stop-motion scenes were wonderful, and carried by considerable charm and energy. But he bookended the film with live-action, and its clearly a medium he's not as comfortable in. Because Monkeybone relies on a lot of live-action, the film suffers as a result.A lot of the live-action scenes tend to degenerate into slapstick farce. An approach that would work fine in animation, but less so in live-action. Brendan Fraser is well suited to this type of material, and he plays the part of Monkeybone with a lot of enthusiasm, but I am starting to get a bit fed up of this kind of shtick that Fraser stars in, because its beginning to seem like the only kind of thing he can do.The most interesting aspects of Monkeybone are inside Stu's mind, where his consciousness is trapped in Downtown, a sort of waystation for lost souls. This is the part of the film that really comes alive, because Downtown's an extraordinary, eye-popping piece of set-design.Its filled with so many details I'm not sure where to begin in describing it. Its like a lunatic carnival if lorded over by Tim Burton. And the way Selick merges stop-motion animated creatures with live actors is quite remarkable. There are too many bizarre creatures to keep track of. Cyclops'. Yellow bulls. Giant sized wasps. But its just as astonishing as HalloweenTown, and even occasionally surpasses that inspired creation through sheer invention.The human cast is OK. Rose McGowan lends fine support as a catgirl who lives in Downtown. The sight of her in a catsuit is worth the price of admission alone! And Whoopi Goldberg makes a nicely exasperated Death.But Monkeybone is less than the sum of its parts. Its a film that doesn't go far enough. And substitutes crude toilet humour when the invention runs out. A failing that works against the film is the character of Monkeybone himself. He's not really an interesting character. He's just some obnoxious chimp who looks like he's wandered in from another film.Sadly, Monkeybone was another flop for Selick. Granted I was a little disappointed with it, especially when compared to Selick's previous work. Even if it has moments of real inspired lunacy, its just not up to the high standards of Henry Selick, and only seems to add a further nail into the coffin of his flagging career. And he's a man who really deserves much better.

There was the usual array of old Ashley Judd movies and obscure suspense titles. Then I saw it- Benny and Joon. I quickly scanned the back for the synopsis, figured it might be an OK watch, and tossed it into my basket.I'll admit that one of the main reasons that I got the movie was because of Johnny Depp. He is one of the most versatile among the top actors now, rivaled only by Christian Bale. I had always been curious about his older pre-POTC works, so I saw the movie as a great opportunity to check him out. He was anything but disappointing in this film. It's hard to believe that the same man playing the quiet, eclectically talented and unbelievably cute young comedian outcast Sam is as equally convincing as the drunken, drawling, and flamboyant pirate Jack Sparrow. Yet, it seems that with Johnny just about anything is possible.Of course, we can take nothing away from the other actors and actresses of the film, who played all of their roles terrifically. Mary Stuart Masterson gives an unbelievably believable performance as Juniper (Joon) Pearl. Ruggedly handsome Aidan Quinn is great as the almost-burnt-out, but patient and caring older brother. Julianne Moore and Oliver Platt both played their supporting roles well.What can I say? This movie seems to transcend all clichés with incredible ease. From my movie viewing experience, the leading lady of any romance is either a lovestruck teenage girl or a working class mid-twenties\/thirties woman who has been burned too many times and is trying to hide it. The leading man is someone who the director hopes will be perceived as a gorgeous hunk by every female watching the movie, and he either hides his love behind a cold, sarcastic exterior or is a classy, confident flirt.The characters are a big part of turning those stereotypes on their head. Joon Pearl is extremely artistic and intelligent, with a sometimes sharp tongue and an eye for detail, but is forced to depend on her older brother because of her mental illness. Sam, who is also smart and talented in his own peculiar way, was never acknowledged in this by his parents or the cousin that he lived with, and was hampered by his struggle in learning to read and write. Benjamin Pearl (Benny), a car mechanic fitting the resident romance movie gorgeous hunk stereotype, struggles with the decision of either abandoning Joon to a group home as both his friends and psychiatrist have advised or continuing to sacrifice his freedom and the chance for a romance of his own for her.The story doesn't seem like one that would make good romantic comedy, and yet the characters fit in perfectly to make it one. The movie is such a paradox, as it almost seems to make fun of and exaggerate the character's particular weaknesses and quirks, yet was still so sensitive, heart-warming and believable. It is also a breath of fresh air from the one-sided view of love that romance movies and romance novels seem to propagating. They nearly always ignore the true, sacrificial love like the kind that Benny shows towards Joon, in being completely patient and undemanding towards her at all times. Joon and Sam are also this way in that they care deeply for each other, despite the fact that each of them has their own unique disabilities. The romantic moments of the movie are not disgustingly fairy-tale like. There is no long flowery dialogue and exaggerated music. Sam and Joon, although more than likely in their early or mid twenties, are completely ignorant when it comes to romance and are almost child-like in their interactions with each other. It was impossible for me not to grin.Undoubtedly, this is one of those movies that will probably be perceived in one of three ways; as a completely silly, utterly unrealistic piece of garbage; as a rare artistic gem; as a movie whose only impact was confusion. My verdict is rare artistic gem, even though it took a little bit for that to sink in. For, despite the gigantic grin on my face at the end of the movie, I was hovering between considering it silly fluff and just feeling plain confused.One thing of note about the movie though, is that it does deal with everything in a short amount of screen time. Today, the movie would probably be longer and try to delve a little deeper into Joon's unique psyche. Maybe it would have explained how Sam ended up living with his cousin anyway. In the end, though, the fact that the movie was still such an enjoyable ride makes me wonder if we even really need to know.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"21 July 2007","score":"","review":" I was sifting through the $5 crate of DVDs at Wal-Mart- something that I try to do every time that I visit the entertainment section of the store- seeing if there was anything there that might catch my attention. There was the usual array of old Ashley Judd movies and obscure suspense titles. Then I saw it- Benny and Joon. I quickly scanned the back for the synopsis, figured it might be an OK watch, and tossed it into my basket.I'll admit that one of the main reasons that I got the movie was because of Johnny Depp. He is one of the most versatile among the top actors now, rivaled only by Christian Bale. I had always been curious about his older pre-POTC works, so I saw the movie as a great opportunity to check him out. He was anything but disappointing in this film. It's hard to believe that the same man playing the quiet, eclectically talented and unbelievably cute young comedian outcast Sam is as equally convincing as the drunken, drawling, and flamboyant pirate Jack Sparrow. Yet, it seems that with Johnny just about anything is possible.Of course, we can take nothing away from the other actors and actresses of the film, who played all of their roles terrifically. Mary Stuart Masterson gives an unbelievably believable performance as Juniper (Joon) Pearl. Ruggedly handsome Aidan Quinn is great as the almost-burnt-out, but patient and caring older brother. Julianne Moore and Oliver Platt both played their supporting roles well.What can I say? This movie seems to transcend all clichés with incredible ease. From my movie viewing experience, the leading lady of any romance is either a lovestruck teenage girl or a working class mid-twenties\/thirties woman who has been burned too many times and is trying to hide it. The leading man is someone who the director hopes will be perceived as a gorgeous hunk by every female watching the movie, and he either hides his love behind a cold, sarcastic exterior or is a classy, confident flirt.The characters are a big part of turning those stereotypes on their head. Joon Pearl is extremely artistic and intelligent, with a sometimes sharp tongue and an eye for detail, but is forced to depend on her older brother because of her mental illness. Sam, who is also smart and talented in his own peculiar way, was never acknowledged in this by his parents or the cousin that he lived with, and was hampered by his struggle in learning to read and write. Benjamin Pearl (Benny), a car mechanic fitting the resident romance movie gorgeous hunk stereotype, struggles with the decision of either abandoning Joon to a group home as both his friends and psychiatrist have advised or continuing to sacrifice his freedom and the chance for a romance of his own for her.The story doesn't seem like one that would make good romantic comedy, and yet the characters fit in perfectly to make it one. The movie is such a paradox, as it almost seems to make fun of and exaggerate the character's particular weaknesses and quirks, yet was still so sensitive, heart-warming and believable. It is also a breath of fresh air from the one-sided view of love that romance movies and romance novels seem to propagating. They nearly always ignore the true, sacrificial love like the kind that Benny shows towards Joon, in being completely patient and undemanding towards her at all times. Joon and Sam are also this way in that they care deeply for each other, despite the fact that each of them has their own unique disabilities. The romantic moments of the movie are not disgustingly fairy-tale like. There is no long flowery dialogue and exaggerated music. Sam and Joon, although more than likely in their early or mid twenties, are completely ignorant when it comes to romance and are almost child-like in their interactions with each other.

Neither can I fault it for grossing so much a film that shamelessly panders to over-emoted teenage girls is bound to produce a good showing at the box-office. But the fact that a sloppy period piece that insults the period it pays tribute to could earn such lavish sycophantic adulation from nearly all reviewers (especially celebrity film writers) is just more evidence that America's thought-élite&#151;journalists, politicians, and academics alike&#151;have got to be the most degenerate, gullible, and monolithic in the Western world.There are two intertwined reasons why Titanic is on balance worth seeing the historical setting and the special effects. Enough has been written on the latter, and on the former, as well, but as an Atlantic historian I cannot express enough love for anything so exquisitely and meticulously designed floating on the ocean of my heritage, just around the time my family was making its way over from Europe. Older Rose's remark that, It was the ship of dreams. And it was. It really was, ring so true. I beseech my readers regard the volume of immigrant ship traffic in the era, admire the interior of the ship and the costumes of the passengers and contrast them to the most luxurious modern cruise liners, in an era where ships are often not a necessity, and consider how much the Western world lost in less than a century. (This sort of aesthetic history lesson is the same reason I love Chariots of Fire.)Regard, admire, compare and consider... if, that is, you can get past a script that hangs together like a soggy potato chip and pays not the least attention to real historical personages.Our two protagonists are at best naïvely laughable and at worst totally unsympathetic, their antagonists little more than cartoon characters. That the former speak like modern teenagers is quite appropriate, because they clearly ARE modern teenagers pitted against the backward old fogies of the era. Jack is a romanticized Bohemian bum with little that could possibly seduce a beautiful young Anglo-American socialite away from her privileged life. Rose wants us to believe&#151;and she convinces Jack, somehow&#151;that deep down she's some sort of fiery rebel, yet what I saw was a girl alternating between doing the bidding of her wealthy, domineering cardboard-cutout fiancé Cal and the bidding of her impoverished, sappy, cardboard-looking loverboy Jack. There's so much ham and cheese at work you'll want to take a fork and start eating.And there is something utterly vile about their story, which, again, is clearly aimed at adolescent females, and that fact makes Titanic's moral tone all the more disturbing. This is a film with an agenda all the authority figures are stupid murderous bigots, the 17-year-old heroine is glorified for rebelling against her mother and fornicating with a wild rover, and don't forget that wicked cabin church excluding third-class passengers from attending the Sunday service on that fateful last day of Titanic's voyage.In reality, the whole ship was completely segregated. I am told church services were excepted, though I have my doubts, but not because of snobbery on anyone's part. Third-class passengers were largely immigrants without medical certificates and in that era of the great migrations, were required to register at Ellis Island; hence U.S. law required complete segregation on all inbound European ships. And, on these grounds, it scarcely needs saying, such a liaison between Jack and Rose, far from stupid and implausible, was quite impossible.Finally, despite the segregation, Doug Phillips has pointed out, there is no credible evidence that first-class passengers were given priority seating rights. To the contrary, there are numerous accounts of first-class passengers giving up their seats and assisting third-class passengers into lifeboats.There are plenty of other factual gaffes, many of them less severe (such as the bad British accents), but by far the most appalling is the libelous depiction of the ship's crew. There is no evidence that William Murdoch accepted bribes from a cowardly aristocrat, nor that he shot two men, nor that he subsequently committed suicide, and so far as I know, such a portrayal was a completely ad hoc invention on the writers' part. (James Cameron's apology to the Murdoch family was too little, too late.) The surviving passengers testified that the crew performed their duties sacrificially and heroically that evening. That is the biggest sin of this film the real heroes of the Titanic tragedy (with the exception of Thomas Andrews) are washed over or even villanized in favor of capricious brats, only one of whom gets his comeuppance.Even so, towards the ship's final gasp of life, we do get a good sense of the imminent terror not only in Jack and Rose, but in all 1,500 souls who perished that evening. The worst moment had to be the power outage it's those last, frightening milestones on the road to destruction that remind you where you are headed irreversibly, and the scene of the actual sinking captures this perfectly. The true story of the RMS Titanic, from its building to its sinking, and even its aftermath as grown Belfast men whose labor on that ship had been the pride and joy of their city wept in the streets at the news of her demise, is beautifully tragic and inspirational.

It's a great movie, even one of Disney's finest underrated works.This charming film, while undoubtedly heartwarming, is also creative and very lively. It has lots of adventure and suspense, classic humor, fine artwork, a wonderful soundtrack and a dark atmosphere. When I say dark I mean dark in the sense of being somewhat chilly, but without being extremely dark or a story of horror\/terror. The darkness of the Devil's Bayou is amazing, creepy to the point of almost looking like a forbidding place, which helps a lot to create this distinct atmosphere.Despite the apparent simplicity, this motion picture has some very artistic palette colors. One good example of this is the amazing and gorgeous opening sequence. The beautiful but sad song 'The Journey' matches in perfection.The song 'Tomorrow is another day' is very optimistic and nostalgic. Not just that, it fits perfectly on that sequence beautiful vistas painted with heart and soul. Besides, that rainbow and those New York City lights at night look incredibly real.The song 'Someone's waiting for you' is heartwarming, but so is the sequence itself. 'The U.S. Air Force' is a delightful instrumental music, very energetic and full of life.Medusa is a great villain. One of Disney's best villains, says I. She's mean and nasty, but at the same time funny (even hilarious at times). She is a little eccentric but not too much and not annoying. Besides, she isn't too sinister or one of the most cruel villains.Medusa's sidekick, Snoops, is someone I don't consider a real villain. He's not bad enough to be a villain and he doesn't know how to be bad, although he attempts. I think that deep down he is a good guy. I like Snoops he's a simple and goofy guy but funny (even hilarious at times) and not that bad. He's more of a poor guy who messed with the wrong person.By the way, Medusa and Snoops have a nice pawn shop named Medusa's pawn shop or, like Medusa delightfully says on the telephone, «Madame Medusa's pawn shop boutique».Comical characters like Luke and the albatross Orville have small roles, perhaps because this movie is more of a dramatic natured one. Numerous swamp animals appear (others than Luke), but their roles are minor (with the exception of Ellie Mae and Evinrude).Bernard is the kind of romantic and shy hero. Bianca has a characteristic hungarian charm (her voice actress, Eva Gabor, was hungarian). Orville is carefree and spirited, as well as a comic relief. Like albatrosses in real life, he flies beautifully but is very bad at landings.Evinrude's sounds are awesome. They sound so real! I have no words to describe them! James MacDonald really had a gift for sounds.Penny was apparently modeled after Michelle Stacy, the cute little girl who did her voice. Penny is cute and has a very cute voice. People sympathize with Penny and her situation in the film, yet despite being very endearing she is also confident and has a strong personality - something which Snoops doesn't know how to deal with.The crocodiles Nero and Brutus are hilarious in every scene they appear. I don't know why, but there is something hilarious about them even just by looking at them. They are at their most hilarious when they play organ. And those rascals really know how to play talent, LOL. They have talent for music, LOL! Besides, although they are Medusa's loyal pets, they are good crocodiles and not vicious. Whenever they catch Penny, they always grab her carefully not to harm her. And they are just as careful with her beloved teddy bear. Even in the water they have special care with her and her teddy bear.A very good and timeless Disney classic!

The type of Ed Wood movies. The Day the Earth Stood Still is a much, much different movie fortunately!It's not a movie that tries to impress, it's instead more of a movie that tries to provoke and at all time remain as realistic as possible. The movie its message is clear and (unfortunately) it still applies today, just as much as it did over 50 years ago.Normally these type of movies from this time period would be about aliens causing mayhem and destruction, by trying to take over or simply destroy the Earth. This movie does begin as one of those sort of movies but soon starts to take a positive turn, when it starts to totally focus on its script and story, rather than any action or over-the-top science-fiction moments. It's a clever and provoking movie. Everything happening in this movie happens with a reason.The way the alien visits Earth and tries to discover things and places is done in a great way. It's a reflecting and objective view of a neutral person. It's really a movie that holds up a mirror to the world and therefor works great and effective as a social commentary, that still applies today.The movie has some great convincing special effects (especially for '50's standards of course) that are still acceptable by today standards. The movie is not as cheap looking as most of the genre movies from the same time period, though I imaging this movie had just such an high budget as any other. So also real big kudos to director Robert Wise who brought it all so very well and convincing to the screen. Robert Wise would later make also such science-fiction classics as The Andromeda Strain and Star Trek The Motion Picture. Another thing that makes this movie distinct itself from other is the classic Bernard Herrmann score.The main character is greatly played by the unknown Michael Rennie . He really has the right looks of an alien in human form. Also surprising how important and strong the female character played by Patricia Neal in this movie is. The always great Sam Jaffe also plays a good, though small role in the movie. But the real classic and most memorable character of the movie is the robot Gort, played by the very tall Lock Martin. Even though it's not a character that talks or even movies a lot, it's still one that impresses very much, just by its looks and actions.

Pyle (Vincent D' Onofrio) and Joker (Matthew Modine), both mentally scarred by the teachings of sadistic Sgt. Hartman (R. Lee Ermey). In Paths, however, the dreadful actions do not take place on the battlefield, but in a courtroom it is in that courtroom that three randomly selected French soldiers (the context is WWI) are to be court-martial-ed, the charges being cowardliness and refusal to accomplish the mission assigned to them. What the prosecutors don't know is that the mission in question (attacking the Anthill) would have resulted in a bloodbath on the French side and that Gen. Mireau (George MacReady), who ordered the attack and also insisted on holding the trial, was so disappointed he actually asked one of his men to shoot the retreating soldiers. The only person who seems to understand what is really going on is Col. Dax (Kirk Douglas), and it is his difficult job to convince his superiors of the necessity of the squad's behavior.Anyone who is even vaguely acquainted with Kubrick knows this is not going to be a fairy tale Paths of Glory is one of the most effective anti-war films ever made because it is not afraid to expose the more rotten aspects of what happens in these situations (and it invites comparison with the M*A*S*H episode where Alan Alda makes a documentary and says This is no way to end a movie, I know that, but war is no movie). The director openly criticizes the very nature of conflict by immediately taking Dax's side, showing that he, unlike Mireau who admires the size of the trenches (one of the most beautiful of Kubrick's many tracking shots) and only wants to be remembered as a great general, is more concerned about bringing his men back home as unharmed as possible, putting glory aside.One scene in particular supports the filmmakers'point more than anything else the trial. While the prosecutor just wants to have the three soldiers sentenced to death and barely pays attention to them, Dax (played with solemn authority by Douglas) allows them to explain what actually occurred during the attack and uses this to openly express his contempt for what the war has done to everyone around him, depriving them of any reason and consideration for human life. That one powerful and upsetting sequence proves beyond any doubt that any war, no matter how noble it may be in its organizer's intentions, is totally and utterly incapable of bringing any real profit all that results is hatred and greed.Kubrick directed nine more pictures after this one, and all of them dealt on some level with the frailty of humanity and its inevitable decline.

It is also one of the only sequels which belong to the canon list of Disney classics.This is a sequel to the classic 'The Rescuers' from 13 years before and it's quite different than what it was originally going to be. Instead of a sequel about Penny living happy with her adoptive parents, this is a brand new adventure.With the exception of Bernard, Miss Bianca and Mr. Chairman, the characters are all different. Almost the entire cast is different too, except Bob Newhart, Eva Gabor and Bernard Fox.To be fair, the original movie is far superior. That I definitely agree. However, some people consider this to be a disgrace and honestly it isn't that bad. Comparing to most Disney sequels, this is much better.Although this movie is brand new, it is naturally inspired by the original's idea. That's why it is so equal and so different at the same time.This time, instead of the Devil's Bayou, our mice heroes (Bernard and Bianca) go to Australia to save not a little girl, but a little boy named Cody who is in more danger than Penny was.Instead of Orville, this time who takes them to their destiny is his humorous brother Wilbur. There are no swamp animals this time and surprisingly no Evinrude. I'm surprised because Evinrude joins the RAS at the end of the original movie. Jake is their guide. Instead of Medusa, Snoops and Brutus & Nero, now the villain is an evil poacher named McLeach and his sidekick is a goanna named Joanna.Initially Orville was going to be in this movie, but after Jim Jordan's death in 1988 they created Wilbur with the voice of the comedian John Candy. That was a better and more clever solution than replacing the original voice. At least on this nobody can say they didn't do the right thing.The good of this movie the sceneries are amazing, you can appreciate the natural beauty of Australia, that wonderful country nearly at the end of the world; Joanna is a comic relief, she's simply hilarious; there are some nice songs (such as the morbid Home on the Range by McLeach and the very lively Black Slacks by Joe Bennett and the Sparkletones); this movie is fun, has danger, action, adventure, darkness and classic humor; it has got one of the best Disney villains and one of my favorite Disney villains (McLeach); Wilbur is a very amusing character; Cody is a good boy; the glorious scenes with Cody and the magnificent & enormous golden eagle Marahute; it is one of the only good and watchable Disney sequels.The bad of this movie mostly the disturbing moments with Wilbur suffering emotionally and physically at the hospital; the fact that the animals which are McLeach's prisoners are forgotten at the end, without knowing what happens to them; Wilbur is forgotten too and left all alone, but in a different way (still he is neglected); some characters aren't that appealing (such as Frank - although with his funny moments, he overacts and is so exaggerated that he quickly becomes tiring); the whole restaurant sequence, which is absolutely unnecessary and has no purpose for the rest of the film; it lacks character development (something which the first one does better); besides, this isn't as good as the first one, somehow lacking the charm of that one; unfortunately, it may also have been responsible for the mess of Disney sequels that would come in the following years.Despite its many faults, it is still a good movie. And, together with the original, it was an important part of my wonderful childhood. The intense nostalgia feeling it brings to those who grew up with it (like me) is more than enough to appreciate it better and excuse its faults. Besides, the fact that most Disney sequels pale next to this improves the impression on it. Nevertheless, this movie remains as one of the least appreciated Disney classics and quite underrated.The villain is a wanted local poacher. He drives a giant monstrous truck. He is pure evil, sadistic, greedy and even creepy at times (such as in one scene when his eyes glow red). He's got a morbid sense of humor, yet his patience is short and he's prone to major anger. So, McLeach is not the right guy to irritate. There's no denying that he is more dangerous, more cruel and more violent than Medusa. He's a killer. Joanna is used and abused by him (both physically and psychologically). Besides, he was gonna feed Cody to the crocodiles! But still he is a great villain.This should definitely be on Top 250.

There are no swamp animals this time and surprisingly no Evinrude. I'm surprised because Evinrude joins the RAS at the end of the original movie. Jake is their guide. Instead of Medusa, Snoops and Brutus & Nero, now the villain is an evil poacher named McLeach and his sidekick is a goanna named Joanna.Initially Orville was going to be in this movie, but after Jim Jordan's death in 1988 they created Wilbur with the voice of the comedian John Candy. That was a better and more clever solution than replacing the original voice. At least on this nobody can say they didn't do the right thing.The good of this movie the sceneries are amazing, you can appreciate the natural beauty of Australia, that wonderful country nearly at the end of the world; Joanna is a comic relief, she's simply hilarious; there are some nice songs (such as the morbid Home on the Range by McLeach and the very lively Black Slacks by Joe Bennett and the Sparkletones); this movie is fun, has danger, action, adventure, darkness and classic humor; it has got one of the best Disney villains and one of my favorite Disney villains (McLeach); Wilbur is a very amusing character; Cody is a good boy; the glorious scenes with Cody and the magnificent & enormous golden eagle Marahute; it is one of the only good and watchable Disney sequels.The bad of this movie mostly the disturbing moments with Wilbur suffering emotionally and physically at the hospital; the fact that the animals which are McLeach's prisoners are forgotten at the end, without knowing what happens to them; Wilbur is forgotten too and left all alone, but in a different way (still he is neglected); some characters aren't that appealing (such as Frank - although with his funny moments, he overacts and is so exaggerated that he quickly becomes tiring); the whole restaurant sequence, which is absolutely unnecessary and has no purpose for the rest of the film; it lacks character development (something which the first one does better); besides, this isn't as good as the first one, somehow lacking the charm of that one; unfortunately, it may also have been responsible for the mess of Disney sequels that would come in the following years.Despite its many faults, it is still a good movie. And, together with the original, it was an important part of my wonderful childhood. The intense nostalgia feeling it brings to those who grew up with it (like me) is more than enough to appreciate it better and excuse its faults. Besides, the fact that most Disney sequels pale next to this improves the impression on it. Nevertheless, this movie remains as one of the least appreciated Disney classics and quite underrated.The villain is a wanted local poacher. He drives a giant monstrous truck. He is pure evil, sadistic, greedy and even creepy at times (such as in one scene when his eyes glow red). He's got a morbid sense of humor, yet his patience is short and he's prone to major anger. So, McLeach is not the right guy to irritate. There's no denying that he is more dangerous, more cruel and more violent than Medusa. He's a killer. Joanna is used and abused by him (both physically and psychologically). Besides, he was gonna feed Cody to the crocodiles! But still he is a great villain.This should definitely be on Top 250.

After my first viewing, it wasn't a movie I was desperate to watch again, but at the time, I probably would have still given it an 8\/10. I didn't watch it again until five years later, this time aware of how the film had generally been received (it turned out to be fairly polarizing, in case you didn't know). This time, I don't think it quite did the same for me as it did during my first viewing, but it still left me reasonably satisfied.Set in the Middle Ages, the story begins with the death of a knight during a jousting tournament. The peasant squires of this knight are William Thatcher, Roland, and Wat Falhurst. With their master no longer with them, the three head out on a journey. William hopes to become a jouster, but the problem is that he is not of noble birth, so it is forbidden for him to joust. Despite this, he is still determined. Along the trail, the three meet an author named Geoffrey Chaucer. Chaucer is broke and manages to work out a deal with the squires. They save him from the poor state his life is in, taking him along on their journey, and he forges documents, allowing William to joust under the name Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein. Soon, William finds himself competing in tournaments around Europe, as he attempts to win the hand of Lady Jocelyn, but how long will he be able to keep the truth about himself a secret?!As a comedy, A Knight's Tale could have been better. The gag at the beginning, with Wat kicking the body of his master repeatedly, hoping he's not really dead, is hilarious, but unfortunately, not too many, if any of the gags that follow can match that one. However, there are other gags which are at least good for a snicker, so I can give the movie SOME credit as a comedy. As an adventure flick, the film doesn't do as well as it could have, either. The movie tends to drag a bit at times, and probably would have been superior had it been made a bit shorter. Some films that are over two hours long are consistently stunning, but A Knight's Tale is certainly not one of those. Fortunately, it still does have some exciting moments, probably especially towards the end, so it's watchable, in my opinion at least.Some viewers might criticise this movie for its historical inaccuracies. I'm not a history buff, so I really can't point out many inaccuracies, apart from the obvious, such as the crowd singing along to We Will Rock You by Queen around the beginning, with the film taking place centuries before the song was written. You will hear several rock songs in the film, giving it a modern touch. However, A Knight's Tale is not a historical drama strictly made to educate viewers on the time. It's a film that was made mainly for entertainment, and as such, it succeeds at a reasonable level. You might even be able to call the movie a spoof (or at least part of it). So, if you want a fully dramatic and accurate film about the Middle Ages, then this is not what you're looking for, but if you want an entertaining adventure film set in the Middle Ages, with some mild laughs here and there, this could be one for you to check out.

Not every age has felt itself inferior to any past age, nor have all believed themselves superior to every preceding age. Every historical period displays a different feeling in respect of this strange phenomenon of the vital altitude, and I am surprised that thinkers and historians have never taken note of such an evident and important fact. ... The majority of historical periods did not look upon their own time as superior to preceding ages. On the contrary, the most usual thing has been for men to dream of better times in a vague past, of a fuller existence; of a golden age, as those taught by Greece and Rome have it...This indicates that such men feel the pulse of their own lives lacking in full vigor, incapable of completely flooding their blood channels. For this reason they looked with respect on the past, on classic epochs, when existence seemed to them fuller, richer, more perfect and strenuous than the life of their own time.Let it not be forgotten; our time is a time which follows on a period of plenitude. Hence it is that, inevitably, the man living on the other bank, the man of that plenary epoch just past, who sees everything from his own view-point, will suffer from the optical illusion of regarding our age as a fall from plenitude, as a decadent period. But the lifelong student of history, the practiced feeler of the pulse of times, cannot allow himself to be deceived by this system of optics based on imaginary periods of plenitude.... For such a plenitude of time to exist, it is in that a long-felt desire, dragging its anxious, eager way through centuries, is at last one day satisfied, and in fact these plenary periods are times which are self-satisfied; occasionally, as in the XIXth Century, more than satisfied with themselves. But we are now beginning to realize that these centuries, so self-satisfied, so perfectly rounded-off, are dead within. Genuine vital integrity does not consist in satisfaction, in attainment, in arrival.... When a period has satisfied its desires, its ideal, this means that it desires nothing more; that the wells of desire have been dried up. That is to say, our famous plenitude is in reality a coming to an end. There are centuries which die of self-satisfaction through not knowing how to renew their desires, just as the happy drone dies after the nuptial flight....In the drawing-room gatherings of last century there inevitably arrived a moment when the ladies and their tame poets put this question, one to the other At what period of history would you like to have lived? And straightaway each of them, making a bundle of his own personal existence, started off on an imaginary tramp along the roads of history in search of a period into which that existence might most delightfully fit. And the reason was that although feeling itself, because it felt itself, arrived at plenitude, the XIXth Century was still, in actual fact, bound to the past, on whose shoulders it thought it was standing; it saw itself actually as the culmination of that past. Hence it still believed in periods relatively classic- the age of Pericles the Renaissance- during which the values that hold to-day were prepared. This should be enough to cause suspicion of these periods of plenitude; they have their faces turned backwards, their eyes are on the past which they consider fulfilled in themselves. And now, what would be the sincere reply of any representative man of to-day if such a question were put to him? I think there can be no doubt about it; any past time, without exception, would give him the feeling of a restricted space in which he could not breathe. That is to say, the man of to-day feels that his life is more a life than any past one, or, to put it the other way about, the entirety of past time seems small to actual humanity. This intuition as regards present-day existence renders null by its stark clarity any consideration about decadence that is not very cautiously thought out. To start with, our present life feels itself as ampler than all previous lives. How can it regard itself as decadent?

We look backwards and the famous Renaissance reveals itself as a period of narrow provincialism, of futile gestures- why not say the word?- ordinary. What, then, in a word is the height of our times? It is not the fullness of time, and yet it feels itself superior to all times past, and beyond all known fullness. It is not easy to formulate the impression that our epoch has of itself; it believes itself more than all the rest, and at the same time feels that it is a beginning.

Wait long its like 10 minutes between lines. In all the movie is crap, crap and crap. I watched it, and had to come here to read the plot. To find out what the movie was about lol. I read flixster for a plot on this movie its different. I think people are just guessing on what its about. In the end no one knows. You can say anything and it could be. Cant believe anyone would actually like this movie. I could film crap on a stick and if they liked this move. They would probably like my movie to rofl. Artsy is one thing, this is a stretch from that, and just pure crap.

I was able to find the original VHS release at a video rental for a dollar. The animation is amazing, in my opinion pioneering the emotional, expressive style that Disney used a decade later. Ms. Frisby's character is a mouse, but her facial expressions are startlingly human. This isn't your standard Disney-animated children's movie fare either. Some scenes are surprisingly dramatic and graphic. The scene I remember the most is when Frisby enters the Great Owl's lair, only to be chased by the ugliest, most horrifying animated spider I've ever seen. Then seconds later, the spider is crushed to a pulp beneath the Great Owl's giant, razor sharp talon. The Owl used to give me nightmares. The storyline is somewhat original but the underlying theme seems to center around animal rights. When her mouse-child falls ill with pneumonia and she finds out she must move her house to avoid having it demolished by a plow two days later (man that's heavy stuff), Ms. Frisby seeks the help of a secret society of intelligent lab rats. The leader, a wise old rat named Nicodemus tells her of a group of rats who were captured and subjected to a number of tests, but most importantly injected with a formula to make them more intelligent. Ms. Frisby's husband led a revolt to break out of the lab, and ended up in a rose bush on a farmland plot, exactly where Ms. Frisby had spent her life. There is a subplot involving a power-mad dictator rat named Jenner who tries to assassinate the current leader. This is a truly awesome piece of animation. The character development is also done well, Dom Deluise is my favorite character, a hyperactive but dopey blackbird named Jeremy. If you like cartoons or any kind of artwork (the backgrounds are beautifully rendered) you'll appreciate this movie.

It has such realistic people, it kept me fascinated because it seemed so different from most films I've watched.There aren't a lot of dramatic things that happen in the story yet, as a whole, it's a wonderful tale that stays with you. It's a lot more than just seeing an Oscar-winning performance by Robert Duvall as Texan and former C&W singer and writer, Mac Sledge. It's simply good storytellingI can't say I am a fan of Duvall's country singing, but that is the only thing I didn't like. Well, maybe Dixie (Betty Buckley), who played a bitter ex-wife of Duvall's in here. She was not pleasant, but others were really nice, likable people. Yet, this is not some sappy movie just because most of the people are good folks.As in film noirs in which the viewer has a sense of dread, knowing something bad is around the corner, I felt the same thing in this film, even though it didn't necessarily happen. I mean with the main characters Mac, Rosa Lee and Sonny. There was underlying tension, probably because of Sledge's alcoholic and violent past, that made me fear that any minute he was going to ruin the nice setup he had with a good woman and nice stepson. Duvall, as usual, makes his role a fascinating and unpredictable one. With many of the people he has played over the years, you never am sure what his characters are going to do next. Tess Harper, as Mac's new wife, and Alan Hubbard, as her son, are two of the most realistic characters I've ever seen on film. It helped they were from the area so their accents were real.This is a just straight drama, with a solid screenplay by Horton Foote and direction by Bruce Beresford (Driving Miss Daisy). In addition, actors Buckley (who can sing, too), Wilford Brimley and Ellen Barkin all give memorable supporting performances.It was an interesting tale of something I have rarely seen on film in the past 50 years a good Christian woman lifting up a man to her level. She never had to do it verbally, never nagged or preached to the man, just set example of how to act and be a loving, supportive spouse.

It was when I was a kid, but not so much now. There are plenty of other Disney classics which are always a pleasure to watch. However, the same doesn't happen with this one.That said, the movie isn't bad. In fact, it has its own charm and one has to recognize there is nostalgic value about it, not to mention that it's a magical movie. Anyone who was a child in my generation (and before that) is almost for sure familiar with the story of Peter Pan.Strangely, this was the first time that Peter Pan wasn't played by a girl. I have to admit that I was very surprised when I learned that Peter Pan was once played by girls.'Peter Pan' doesn't have the greatness of many other Disney classics. There is some good and some bad about it. What I dislike most about it is any sequence with the Indians. I also think that the Indians, the Lost Boys and most pirates are very poorly drawn. Plus, the Lost Boys are obnoxious and most pirates are annoying (except Captain Hook and Smee).Aside the badly designed characters, the movie's artwork is pretty good in general, with little to be improved. The Big Ben, for example, is amazingly drawn and looks every bit as majestic as it looks in reality. The close-up of Big Ben's clock makes one of this movie's best parts. London in general is well drawn too, the Neverland, Hook's elegant pirate ship... almost everything.There are even well drawn characters, such as Michael Darling, the Darling parents, Nana and Peter Pan.There are plenty of nice funny gags in the film, particularly almost every moment with Mr. Darling, as well as many moments with Hook, Smee and the crocodile. The funniest part of all is when Peter Pan fools Hook by pretending to be the voice of an evil spirit and Smee when he mimics perfectly Hook's voice.The best characters are Mr. Darling, Nana, Michael, Smee, the crocodile and Peter Pan. Why is that? Well, Mr. Darling is a practical and short-tempered father yet good-hearted and hilarious. Nana is the lovable St. Bernard-like babysitter dog. Michael is cute, adorable and innocent as the little one. Smee is more of a comic relief than evil. The crocodile is funny in appearance and personality. Peter Pan is a likable chap, although I recognize that he can be selfish and arrogant at times.Little Michael looks quite a lot like Disney legend Matthew Garber. You better believe I'd really believe that Matthew Garber served as the inspiration to create Michael if I didn't know that Matthew wasn't born until 1956 (this film came in 1953). But the similarities between them are amazing and, to accent them, Matthew played a character named Michael in 'Mary Poppins' (Banks instead of Darling).I almost forgot to talk about Tinkerbell. She is undeniably beautiful and elegant, but hardly likable. She is very jealous, treacherous and mean. She's got some highly questionable attitudes. It's difficult to feel sympathy for her.Captain Hook is indeed one of Disney's funniest villains. But that doesn't change the fact that he is very evil. I don't understand why so many people defend him. He does many despicable things, so he deserves to be tormented by Peter Pan and the crocodile.The Indian Chief is a sinister character. When he says «If Tiger Lily not back by sunset... burnum at stake», that is creepy. His powerful voice makes the line even more disturbing.The film has an interesting voice cast. Hans Conried does a good job both as Mr. Darling and as Captain Hook. Kathryn Beaumont (previously Alice's voice in 'Alice in Wonderland') repeats her talent as Wendy. Bill Thompson, a popular Disney voice, portrays comically well Mr. Smee. Tommy Luske captivates as Michael's voice. And finally the unforgettable Bobby Driscoll as Peter Pan (who also served as live-action model).I appreciate Bobby Driscoll as Pan's voice. This movie is perhaps what he is best remembered for. But as much as it was the pinnacle of his success and film career, it also turned out to be the end of his glory days. It was made in his early teen years and that was notorious in his change of voice. But little did he know what the future had in store for him...As for the soundtrack, it is okay.

His hatred for said picture derived from the fact that he wasn't involved with the project from the start (which is why his name is nowhere to be found in the screen writing credits), but hired only after original director Anthony Mann was fired (the only remains of the latter's work is the opening sequence). Given Kubrick always demanded total control over his pictures, it is understandable that he came to despise his only real Hollywood movie. Nevertheless, Spartacus is a great picture, one that, alongside Ben-Hur, has defined the epic genre for years (and if the best they can make nowadays is Alexander, then its position remains unharmed).The film stars Kirk Douglas, one of the few actors to have worked twice with the director (their previous collaboration was the anti-war masterpiece Paths of Glory), as the eponymous slave who finds himself in the middle of a political war between Roman senators such as Marcus Licinius Crassus (Laurence Olivier) and Sempronius Gracchus (Charles Laughton). Seeing the chaos that is rising throughout Italy, he decides to organize a rebellion, gathering a massive group of followers, including Crassus' former servant Antoninus (Tony Curtis). As the situation gets more preoccupying, the common people watch as Rome is threatened by thousands of inferior individuals, led by a charismatic man who believes in justice and freedom.It is probably the aforementioned beliefs that upset Kubrick, famous as he was for almost celebrating misery and decadence in his films. In fact, despite the famous all-but-cheerful ending (brilliantly spoofed in Monty Python's Life of Brian), Spartacus is one of cinema's best representations of free will and courage prevailing over oppression. Much of this is due to Douglas' performance playing it both ferociously determined (when Spartacus lectures his comrades and prepares for the imminent battle) and touchingly tender (when he meets his future wife, played by Jean Simmons), his performance transcends the character's mythical status and lends him a humanity that makes him instantly likable. Also remarkable are Peter Ustinov, playing slave merchant Batiatus (and winning an Oscar for it), and Olivier, particularly in the now infamous, audacious for the time, seduction scene with Curtis, where food is used as a metaphor for men and women (ironic, if you consider Olivier's part in that scene had to be re-recorded by Anthony Hopkins).The best epics are those that blend the spectacular and the personal, and that is where Spartacus truly succeeds like Ben-Hur and Lawrence of Arabia, it never sacrifices characterization in favor of action, but lets the mesmerizing (and, as opposed to more recent genre films, bloodless) battle sequences be a part of the protagonists' development, bringing the movie closer to Asian wuxia movies such as Hero or Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon than Hollywood blockbusters like Troy.So, in a time where the epic has lost most of its charm, movies like Spartacus are even more essential now than they were before.

Given Kubrick always demanded total control over his pictures, it is understandable that he came to despise his only real Hollywood movie. Nevertheless, Spartacus is a great picture, one that, alongside Ben-Hur, has defined the epic genre for years (and if the best they can make nowadays is Alexander, then its position remains unharmed).The film stars Kirk Douglas, one of the few actors to have worked twice with the director (their previous collaboration was the anti-war masterpiece Paths of Glory), as the eponymous slave who finds himself in the middle of a political war between Roman senators such as Marcus Licinius Crassus (Laurence Olivier) and Sempronius Gracchus (Charles Laughton). Seeing the chaos that is rising throughout Italy, he decides to organize a rebellion, gathering a massive group of followers, including Crassus' former servant Antoninus (Tony Curtis). As the situation gets more preoccupying, the common people watch as Rome is threatened by thousands of inferior individuals, led by a charismatic man who believes in justice and freedom.It is probably the aforementioned beliefs that upset Kubrick, famous as he was for almost celebrating misery and decadence in his films. In fact, despite the famous all-but-cheerful ending (brilliantly spoofed in Monty Python's Life of Brian), Spartacus is one of cinema's best representations of free will and courage prevailing over oppression. Much of this is due to Douglas' performance playing it both ferociously determined (when Spartacus lectures his comrades and prepares for the imminent battle) and touchingly tender (when he meets his future wife, played by Jean Simmons), his performance transcends the character's mythical status and lends him a humanity that makes him instantly likable. Also remarkable are Peter Ustinov, playing slave merchant Batiatus (and winning an Oscar for it), and Olivier, particularly in the now infamous, audacious for the time, seduction scene with Curtis, where food is used as a metaphor for men and women (ironic, if you consider Olivier's part in that scene had to be re-recorded by Anthony Hopkins).The best epics are those that blend the spectacular and the personal, and that is where Spartacus truly succeeds like Ben-Hur and Lawrence of Arabia, it never sacrifices characterization in favor of action, but lets the mesmerizing (and, as opposed to more recent genre films, bloodless) battle sequences be a part of the protagonists' development, bringing the movie closer to Asian wuxia movies such as Hero or Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon than Hollywood blockbusters like Troy.So, in a time where the epic has lost most of its charm, movies like Spartacus are even more essential now than they were before. It may have been dismissed by Kubrick himself, but everyone seems to like it, and for a good reason there is a heart beating beneath the eye-popping exterior.

Unlike some people I don't even find it's badness funny. Perhaps it's greatest fault is it's boring and unoriginal. If you want to see a good movie with more-or-less the same plot, watch Independence Day.On the other hand I'd like to point out some of the films strengths, without implying that they mitigate this travesty in any way. Forrest Whitaker is actually pretty good in his role (which would have been a larger role in the sequel.) There were also some decent performances among the supporting cast of humans and Psychlos. People just tend to forget them because the two principals were so awful.Barry Pepper is probably the worst. I've seen high school kid productions with dad's video camera that contained better performances. The guy simply has no charisma or screen presence. He should go back to bad Sci-Fi channel movies, or wherever he came from. But let me be an apologist for John Travolta. Granted he wasn't very good in this, but he did try to appropriately channel the character from the book. Terel literally is supposed to be on the verge of psychosis, as well as being deviously intelligent and delusional. In a lot of ways Travolta pulls this off. The unfortunate thing is he didn't have much to work with. The true stinker of this film is it's awful script. Perhaps the worst in the last 30 years. The dialog is painful at best and uninspired. It revolves around colloquialisms and cliché's that the worst hack writer wouldn't touch, and nothing that comes out of any characters lips is believable. They don't even manage to follow some of the more interesting plot points of the book, settling for spectacle and silliness like resurrecting a fleet of AV-8B Harriers. (For my part, I think the Uranium tipped bullets from the book would have been cooler; causing the Psychlo's to explode on impact!)Perhaps the most telling comparison that can be made is that with L. Ron Hubbard's novel. The book is not good, but it is entertaining. The movie is neither....and could somebody put the writers out of our misery?
