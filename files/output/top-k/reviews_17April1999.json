Not only did this movie spawn forth 2 equally great sequels, but it has some of the best action scenes of all time.  The acting is also done well, and we also have the best villian of all the Die Hard movies in this one.  Alan Rickman does a superb job as the bad guy, and Bruce Willis became a true action movie hero through this movie.   This movie also has great humorous wisecracks and one liners from McClane.  The best thing I like about the Die Hard's is that the good guy doesn't gun down a hundred people at once, like the ever so cheesy Tomorrow Never Dies.  Die Hard receives a 10\/10, for everything being great about it, and the best action movie of all time. Rated R, and parents should be advised for very high profanity, some nudity, and also very high blood.  This movie would be fine for 15 and up, but don't forget that every other month they play this movie on TV.  Go see this flick and say Yipee Ki Yay!

The response was huge and it soon became clear that Friday the 13th was not a mere paycheck but a serious cash-cow. Sequels followed. And the rest is history.Many, many people claim that Friday the 13th rips off Halloween. Which is not a very fair or kind statement. Sure, it's no work of art and has many similarities, but Halloween was NOT the first slasher movie as Black Christmas and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre came before it. I was actually draw more parallels between this and The Last House on the Left, which was also produced by Cunningham. Friday the 13th is a slicker, tamer film in comparison but if TLHOTL never existed then we would have the Friday the 13th franchise that we have today.The characters and deaths are not so imaginative. All we really get is throat slashings and impalings. But at least the fodder are not as obnoxious and annoying as they would later become in the sequels, when they truly deserved more grotesque deaths.At the time, the ending was surprising only because it came out of nowhere. The sudden unveiling of the killer and motives was random and unexpected. It's weird watching it now, knowing that Jason and parts 2-infinity were never planned. Jason was just a dead boy and nothing more.It's hard to review Friday the 13th on it's own merits rather than the movie that launched a major franchise.

It was the most incredibly tragic and at the same time, gloriously happy thing I have seen in a theater in a LONG time. Roberto Benigni was amazing, the directing was wonderful, many of the gags were entertaining (The egg thing at the beginning), and the story was on the whole wonderful. I have no problems with this movie. Other people, however, did. One common criticism was that it was historically inaccurate. Tell me, honestly, did it really need to be totally precise? We didn't need to know what atrocities were committed for this movie to work, we just needed to know that it was a living hell. Another criticism is the idea that it promotes lying to your children. I do not believe that a child that small could handle the ideas that 1) He or she will be almost certainly killed, and 2) That death will be very brutal. But this is a movie review, not a philosophy forum. In short, this movie, like Life itself, is beautiful. A true must see.

I was reluctant to see it because I usually don't watch cop movies. (I'm under 18, what can I say.  They don't market them for my age group) I couldn't have been more wrong. L.A. Confidential was awesome, very high on my list of good movies, because it was so well done.  The Los Angeles aspect was so distinct, which I appreciated even though I don't know anything about the 50s that isn't on Nick at Nite.  The acting was awesome too, enough that it should have been more recognized at the Oscars.  Everyone gives kudos to Spacey and he was great but I didn't consider him the main part of the film.  I thought that the acting of Guy Pearce and especially of Russell Crowe, stood out.  I thought Crowe had a stronger prescence then Pearce, but they were both good and I really wish that this movie would have been a jumping off point for their careers.  I really want to see more of them! Basinger was good too, worthy of her awards and worthy of a comeback.  I don't think this role was cliche for her because this time she played a blond with intelligence and motives and dimension. The script was great, with a few things that disturbed me and I accepted as part of the story.  The racism, characteristic of that era, and the corruption were effective enough to make me yell at the T.V. I thought people were kicking in doors too much, and shooting first\/asking questions later. Lastly, the soundtrack was awesome.  The jazz sounds that played continuously throughout the film accented the story the way a soundtrack is supposed too. Many people compare this movie to films like CHINATOWN. I can't offer the same comparison because I haven't seen CHINATOWN and I don't know what it's about. But I think L.A. Confidential is a great movie without attaching it to a genre.

After about ten minutes of horrible acting non stop destruction and a script with so many plot holes in it you would think it's swiss cheese you would wish that you were dead.  It starts off with Bruce and all his other red neck friends drilling for oil in what looks like the Atlantic.  Here we get to see Bruce running around with a shotgun (very dangerous) and a small explosion that had no purpose but to stop people from falling asleep.  Then Bruce and his friends get picked by the U.S. government to fly two space ships to the asteroid and blow it up.  In the movie each man gets ten days of training and half of them can't even read, and it still gets worse then this. This film has only two subjects in it that stops you from hanging yourself, one of my favorite actors who's name I can't recall (he was the bad guy in FARGO) and the astounding eye popping special effects.

After about ten minutes of horrible acting non stop destruction and a script with so many plot holes in it you would think it's swiss cheese you would wish that you were dead.  It starts off with Bruce and all his other red neck friends drilling for oil in what looks like the Atlantic.  Here we get to see Bruce running around with a shotgun (very dangerous) and a small explosion that had no purpose but to stop people from falling asleep.  Then Bruce and his friends get picked by the U.S. government to fly two space ships to the asteroid and blow it up.

So with the obvious similarities aside, it is safe to say that Guy Ritchie's movie has brought new life and new twists to the genre, and succeeded where so many other clones have failed.  Some of the reviews I read before seeing this movie complained of a plotline too complicated and dialogue too accent thick as hindrances to understanding the movie.  Three things, first of all, don't underestimate the audience, I had no trouble following the plotline. Anyone who watches Seinfeld, with its separate plotlines coming together at the end, will get it.  The accents I got used to quickly, Amercian audiences loved Trainspotting which had even thicker accents, so that's not a problem. Lastly, complete understanding of the plotline is secondary in a movie like this.  This movie is about comedy, high-energy fun and Ritchie's innovative style that, instead of coming off as showy and unnecessary, puts the right frame around things and keeps the eyes glued to the screen and the butts in the seats.
