Mostly he thinks back to what his routine was (and, it being Chaplin and an old-fashioned clown, it's pretty funny pantomime) and the audience for it. What's interesting in the first flashback he has to performing on stage is that the audience doesn't laugh too much during the act, only near the end is the laughter really present and uproarious. Calvero thinks back to this more in dreams, and tries for a comeback, but has his ups and downs, not least of which due to drink (which, as many an entertainer- musician, actor, whatever- has said that they need a substance to do this or whatever). He has some support from a younger woman who genuinely loves him, though he resists it despite obviously caring for a poor young girl who tries to kill herself but recovers.The two characters are probably quite sad set apart, but together do their best to prop each other up with good words, ones that friends and such do. Their relationship is one of the best things about Limelight, despite sometimes Chaplin not being a writer with a lot of, how should I say, subtlety (as coming from the silent film world he's a good writer, but not always great when sidestepping sentimentality). I especially liked how convincing Claire Bloom was as the dancer, Terry, at making us understand what was so charming but heartbreaking about her, and Calvero too through both of their eyes. It's a tale that takes romance but at a cautious length due to personal feelings. It's not that Calvero can't love her, but should he? Can he be that close to someone when he's been so alone his life? While it could be easy for Chaplin to make it a self-indulgent cry-fest he side-steps that as he is so spot-on in every beat (and why not, he directs himself so well for the entirety of his career, kind of two hats on that Tramp) and makes his character unlikely endearing. He probably is a blow-hard, but he is still human and has faults of his own while some very endearing qualities. No wonder then we want him to come out on top, since he's more than paid his dues, but at the same time the looming presence of the end of the tunnel is there too. Limelight celebrates art and creation to a nice extent; alongside Calvero, Terry is a wonderful dancer, at one point auditioning in a room lit with such expression for the darkness of a room and the light coming in that it almost makes the movie on its own (Chaplin is in the scene too but in the background). Also incredible is when Terry has her big number to perform on stage... but she gets stage fright! How Calvero snaps her out of it is shocking but, maybe, just a little funny(?) Another perk with Limelight- matter of fact why some of us would seek it out- is that it pairs up Chaplin with Buster Keaton, the other masterful silent clown of his day. He actually is not in it for very long (maybe all of five minutes), but what minutes! You have to be patient and not be expecting it to be a Chaplin\/Keaton thing like Hope and Crosby or something. It's at the climax of the film, when Calvero has something of a comeback after some luck, and they do a 'bit' together on stage. I wouldn't be able to spoil it if I tried suffice to say it would be almost enough reason to watch the film even if you had little to no interest in Chaplin and only in Keaton... but, yet, why wouldn't you? It's not a totally great film (that is to say on par with Modern Times of The Kid), admittedly, but it has a lot of great scenes, images, performances, and it bears out the soul of an artist in such a way that is illuminating there is subtext even to the big emotional high points, and seeing into it gives us a better notion of what the idea of Charlie Chaplin was\/is as much as what he could do.

He has directed numerous adaptations from Shakespearian plays and is quite good at it. But in 1994 he decided to take a different approach to adaptation and adapt a slightly more modern, yet still classic, story. This was Mary Shelley's chilling novel Frankenstein. He put together a strong cast, obviously including himself, and got himself a nice budget of 45 million dollars to make his film. The result isn't terrible, but it isn't that great either. It is a vastly different telling of the Frankenstein story compared to the brilliant 1931 film from James Whale. It tells of Victor Frankenstein, an intelligent young man who has a very promising future in the field of medicine. But that changes when his mother dies and he embarks on a maddening quest to bring the dead back to life. After practically going insane he does so, but instead of creating a man he creates a monster. And after neglecting his horrific creation, it escapes and swears revenge on its creator. This is a very odd story and it is one that strangely combines romance and horror into an unfortunately disjointed film.If I could fix this film in just one way and one way only, I would have it slow the hell down! This movie starts with a slow brooding intro in the arctic when we meet Victor Frankenstein who is being chased by his monster. He meets some sailors whose ship is stuck in the ice and they take him in. Frankenstein recounts everything that led up to this point to the ship's captain and the film flashes back many years earlier where the Frankenstein's and their friends are all introduced. From here the movie just takes off, throwing so much storyline at you, not taking time to develop anything fully. Relationships are established and the film just moves on. Major plot points occur and the film gets right on through them and on to the next thing. It is a frustratingly rampant film that just I constantly felt needed to just tone it down a bit and develop this story at a normal and more accessible pace. I'm not saying the film moves too fast to comprehend, but it definitely moves too fast to connect.But if you break the film down and just take the story as it comes, it isn't bad. The setup to the creation of the monster is uselessly long and moments get a bit irritating and you sometimes wish the film would move on, which is ironic considering this film zips through its plot at breakneck speeds. I was really getting tired of the film before the monster was finally introduced, and then the film picked up a bit. Like I said, it is a completely different telling of the Frankenstein story, so that was interesting. The development of the monster character obviously moves a little too fast, staying true to everything else about the film, but it does tell an interesting story. Moments of the film get a little boring but keep its flow moving. The last half hour of this film really made me start to rethink my opinions about the film I had had up until then. The ending is great and very dramatic. You can tell the film has been trying to build up to this moment and that sort of failed, but the ending itself is very entertaining. The film does cram all of its themes of life, death, love, and rebirth into the end and it gets a little sloppy, but the story itself wraps up quite nicely.Artistically this is a pretty nice looking film. The monster is designed well and Robert De Niro's makeup is very grotesque, but it's somewhat amusing knowing that it's Robert De Niro of all people under all that. Branagh shows his knowledge of how to direct a film here, and there are a lot of cool tracking shots and hauntingly beautiful frames. But some of it does go into excess at times and after a while you can get tired of all the dizzying tracking shots spinning around characters as they deliver lines with plenty of melodrama. But it's important not to confuse melodrama with bad acting. The acting here is actually really good, albeit cheesy because of a melodramatic script. Branagh is great as Victor Frankenstein and has some really cool scenes. De Niro as the monster is... well, different. It's not bad but it's very strange to watch the monster learn to speak and write, beginning with not knowing anything to speaking fluently and eloquently in what seems like no time at all. Then of course there's the always strange and always magnificent Helena Bonham Carter who does a great job in this film as Frankenstein's love, Elizabeth. She manages to make melodrama easy to watch, rather than painful.There are a number of things that saved this film from being truly awful. If not for the good acting and nice camera-work this film could have been unbearable. This film tells a story with some interesting themes and some creative aspects, but it just wasn't told as well as it could have been. The pacing issue is probably my biggest complaint, but it's just not a film that is made all that well. It tries to be good, and I say that because I know Branagh is a skilled director with a lot of respect towards filmmaking and how to do it. Frankenstein just missed the mark on a number of things, making it just another film that I will surely forget about soon.

My theory, is that he felt, that this movie, 81\/2, represented one and a half movies, hence the title. Fellini had been undergoing psychoanalysis, both out of intellectual curiosity and as a relief from bouts of depression, - by both Freudian and Jungian analysts. Accordingly, the themes and motifs, that are explored in this movie, are typical of the analysand's world. First, unsurprisingly, you have childhood memories, the culture of the family, schooling, religion, and the meaning of dreams - with all of this history interpreted as a text from which the sex drive and the general capacity, to gain meaning and satisfaction, from one's life, is revealed.Presumably, Fellini was not satisfied by the prospect of repeating La Dolce Vita 1959, which was his first international success. Like Heraclitus, Fellini did not want to repeat himself.The central idea, as the lead character Guido aka the director, reveals, is that a huge set had been built on the sandy beach, towering 200 meters high, which was referred to as the launch-pad. We, the viewers, are advised that as the set is already under construction, this part of the story has been settled on. The launch-pad, will house a spaceship, that will transport the survivors of a radioactive, nuclear catastrophe. The survivors, are fleeing from Earth, to another planet. Guido has come to the date where shooting is to begin. Fellini, then introduces us to the writer\/ critic character, whom the director has hired in order to be his conscience, or in more Freudian terms his superego. The director asks him to read the script and comment on both the authenticity, and the minimum requirements, of a movie, that will not be seen as another false witness, to the facts of wonder, and the miracle of human existence. How can I help protests the critic. Yes you can, I have put off the start for two weeks, says the directorThe critic returns a few scenes later, having read the screenplay - he hands the director some notes. He critiques the movie as follows ...a lack of a central issue, or a philosophical stance, ...a chain of gratuitous episodes,...ambivalent realism, ...a lack of poetic inspiration, ...the camera cinema is 50 years behind other art forms, ...it lacks avant-garde merits but has all its shortcomings. The director starts to read from the notes, ...and the fanciful apparition of the girl at the spring, what does it mean? - an offering of pureness and warmth - of all the symbols that abound in your story, this one is the worst. The director throws the notes down in disgust but immediately retrieves them from the ground with an intense gaze.The critic reappears after the Saraghina scene, where the Catholic culture of Guido's childhood, is highlighted by an incident, with the whorishly portrayed woman, dancing for the sexually repressed young Catholic pupils at the teaching seminary. The rumba, fantastically executed by actress Edra Gale, with music by Nino Rota, leads to a Buster Keaton chase scene, after which, he is chastised in front of his mother, and made to take confession. Guido is firmly told, that sexuality is diabolical. The critic comments ...what does it mean? ...she's a character from your childhood memories, ...she has nothing to do with critical awareness, ...if you want to do something controversial on the Catholic consciousness, ...place yourself on a higher cultural level, apply lucid logic,...not these memories steeped in nostalgia, ...that make you an accomplice.Later the critic states your task is impossible ....to give clear cut features to a crowd of characters ...so sketchy, hazy, non-existent. Guido\/Fellini echoes this, when he boasts to Rossella, his wife's best friend, everything happens in my film - I try to put everything in. In the final denouement with the critic, Guido is quoted from Stendhal ...the solitary ego, that revolves around itself, ends up choked by tears and by laughter. The director then, solemnly places a mask over the critics head, and has him lead off and hanged - this is a great scene in the movie. The next scene, shows the critic still alive, and occupying his seat.The final scene featuring the critic, comes as Guido, the director, cancels the movie, whereupon the critic launches into a long monologue  ...we intellectuals have to be rational to the bitter end ..... there's no point in adding muddle to muddle...we're stifled by words, images, sounds ...an Artist, who is worthy of the name ... should train himself to silence ...remember Rimbaud's decision to give up writing ...perfection is impossible ...it is the true mission of the critic, to sweep away the countless still-births, ...you are like the lame man that leaves his deformed footprint, ...what monstrous presumption ...your squalid catalogue of mistakes ...why should you care about stitching together shreds of your life, ... vague memories, ...and faces of people you were never capable of loving.I'd like to comment on a particularly moving scene in the graveyard with Guido and his dead father we never spoke enough, when the producer referred to throughout as the commander, enters. The father asks him whether his son Guido is a good boy. The commander says he doesn't think so - Guido's father then re-enters the Underworld through a hole in the ground - I found this Jungian scene very touching.In conclusion, I would like to say, that the influence this movie has had on the modern movie is ubiquitous. Some movies not usually mentioned in the long list of mainstream movies, usually cited, are Dennis Hopper's, The Last Movie, Alexandro Jodorowski's, The Holy Mountain see my review, and Bob Dylan's, Renaldo and Clara the full version.

Anything you find in it - humor, dread, amazement - you will be supplying yourself.As with any documentary, choices have been made as to what to include. They are meant to guide us in a particular direction. That is inevitable, and not a failing of this particular piece. If it did not have a point of view, it would be dreadfully dull. Your particular reaction, though, will depend on your pre-existing mindset.So, the film is loaded with clips that make people of the past look preposterous. Soldiers are seen staring down nuclear blasts, authorities are shown giving misinformation, and bomb shelters provoke a storm of confused political messages (they may keep you safe, says the good Reverend, but don't let in that lonely stranger if it might compromise you!). Schmaltzy tunes of the past that treat the subject casually are given the Let them eat cake treatment, as in, how DARE anyone treat this SERIOUS threat lightly. The film is actually quite moralistic in a backhanded sort of way, in a Jonathan Edwards enough of this frivolity, get down on your KNEES and fear the bomb manner.The documentary over-reaches, however. This was brought out in 1982, and clearly was catering to fears brought about by Ronald Reagan's 1980 election. He was seen by many of his opponents as a dangerous cowboy just itching to blow up the world. Crazy to think that now, of course, given the fact that he did not blow up the world the first, second, or hundredth chance that he had, but that was the mantra. The images depicted are all from the mid-1940s to the early 1960s, but they even manage to work in a quick shot of actor Reagan himself from those years.If you want to be smug, as the filmmakers are banking on, and react, as they wish, with weren't they all such idiots, well, fine. But consider this at one point in the film, someone is asked how far you would have to be to be safe from a nuclear blast. Twelve miles, he responds grimly. Then, apparently as the sane response, someone else is shown saying even more grimly that you basically would have to be on Pluto to be safe.Sounds awfully familiar. In 2011, the Japanese government said that to be safe from the Fukushima meltdown, you needed to be, what a coincidence, twelve miles away. Meanwhile, the Americans said you had to be much further away. It's so much easier to sit back and laugh at people thirty years later, isn't it.There is a lot of just plain odd stuff. Richard Nixon, at the depths of infamy at the time of this film, is practically the film's star (heavy?), even though his connection to anything nuclear throughout is forced and tangential (his Kitchen Debate with Khruschev is included just to give him some more negative air time). Just illustrates conclusively the political orientation of the film.There are some surprises. Lloyd Bentsen, later Democratic Party darling, is shown stridently supporting the use of nuclear bombs in Korea (one shudders that this actual mad bomber almost became Vice President and, later, Secretary of Defense). President Eisenhower, though, is shown as a very thoughtful man who apparently appreciates the dangers at hand.Some scenes are shown to make fun of the stay inside, duck and cover advice. Close the windows to protect yourself. So hilarious, who could survive a radiation scenario, right? Well, that is exactly what the residents of Japan are being told to do right this minute. Hahaha, so funny. But doing simple things like that are, in fact, what people are still advised to do if they wish to increase their odds of surviving a nuclear attack. Under the right conditions, say a large enough distance from a blast, it quite actually could save your life. But so much easier to laugh at the notion that closing a window will deter the effects of a hydrogen bomb.Of course, bombs in those days were much, much less powerful than they are today or, for that matter, were in 1982. Some of the advice given in the 1950s that was appropriate for that time obviously is outdated. But easy to make fun of people then based on what we face now, isn't it?Those were the early days of educating people about nuclear events, and there was a lot of misinformation, hyperbole, guess-work and so forth, all given the wise-guy send-up of the malicious tool out to make fun of people. The anti-Soviet attitudes are widely ridiculed, and, given that all-important hindsight, rightly so. And certainly, the complacent idea that nuclear wars are somehow OK is the film-makers' real target, and who is going to deny that (well, maybe Lloyd Bentsen if he were still around). The filmmakers are stacking the deck just a might too heavily against people of the past who sincerely were groping for answers before it just became a fool's common knowledge that there is no surviving radiation and you are better off just running outside and standing out in the open to hasten your doom if the worst happens.Just all right as a documentary. Obviously, widely missed the mark with me as either an exercise in comedy or satire. More interesting as insight into the evident cold war paranoia of those who made the film (and their sad, misguided fear of Reagan) than as any kind of insight into the times depicted.

The filmmakers are stacking the deck just a might too heavily against people of the past who sincerely were groping for answers before it just became a fool's common knowledge that there is no surviving radiation and you are better off just running outside and standing out in the open to hasten your doom if the worst happens.Just all right as a documentary.

Anything you find in it - humor, dread, amazement - you will be supplying yourself.As with any documentary, choices have been made as to what to include. They are meant to guide us in a particular direction. That is inevitable, and not a failing of this particular piece. If it did not have a point of view, it would be dreadfully dull. Your particular reaction, though, will depend on your pre-existing mindset.So, the film is loaded with clips that make people of the past look preposterous. Soldiers are seen staring down nuclear blasts, authorities are shown giving misinformation, and bomb shelters provoke a storm of confused political messages (they may keep you safe, says the good Reverend, but don't let in that lonely stranger if it might compromise you!). Schmaltzy tunes of the past that treat the subject casually are given the Let them eat cake treatment, as in, how DARE anyone treat this SERIOUS threat lightly. The film is actually quite moralistic in a backhanded sort of way, in a Jonathan Edwards enough of this frivolity, get down on your KNEES and fear the bomb manner.The documentary over-reaches, however. This was brought out in 1982, and clearly was catering to fears brought about by Ronald Reagan's 1980 election. He was seen by many of his opponents as a dangerous cowboy just itching to blow up the world. Crazy to think that now, of course, given the fact that he did not blow up the world the first, second, or hundredth chance that he had, but that was the mantra. The images depicted are all from the mid-1940s to the early 1960s, but they even manage to work in a quick shot of actor Reagan himself from those years.If you want to be smug, as the filmmakers are banking on, and react, as they wish, with weren't they all such idiots, well, fine. But consider this at one point in the film, someone is asked how far you would have to be to be safe from a nuclear blast. Twelve miles, he responds grimly. Then, apparently as the sane response, someone else is shown saying even more grimly that you basically would have to be on Pluto to be safe.Sounds awfully familiar. In 2011, the Japanese government said that to be safe from the Fukushima meltdown, you needed to be, what a coincidence, twelve miles away. Meanwhile, the Americans said you had to be much further away. It's so much easier to sit back and laugh at people thirty years later, isn't it.There is a lot of just plain odd stuff. Richard Nixon, at the depths of infamy at the time of this film, is practically the film's star (heavy?), even though his connection to anything nuclear throughout is forced and tangential (his Kitchen Debate with Khruschev is included just to give him some more negative air time). Just illustrates conclusively the political orientation of the film.There are some surprises. Lloyd Bentsen, later Democratic Party darling, is shown stridently supporting the use of nuclear bombs in Korea (one shudders that this actual mad bomber almost became Vice President and, later, Secretary of Defense). President Eisenhower, though, is shown as a very thoughtful man who apparently appreciates the dangers at hand.Some scenes are shown to make fun of the stay inside, duck and cover advice. Close the windows to protect yourself. So hilarious, who could survive a radiation scenario, right? Well, that is exactly what the residents of Japan are being told to do right this minute. Hahaha, so funny. But doing simple things like that are, in fact, what people are still advised to do if they wish to increase their odds of surviving a nuclear attack. Under the right conditions, say a large enough distance from a blast, it quite actually could save your life. But so much easier to laugh at the notion that closing a window will deter the effects of a hydrogen bomb.Of course, bombs in those days were much, much less powerful than they are today or, for that matter, were in 1982.

If you aren't old enough to remember them, ask your parents or some other old fogy--there just isn't enough room in my review to adequately explain who these freaks were, so you should watch the documentary to get SOME idea of this. But be forewarned that much of what you hear and see in the film is through the words of the Bakkers and their few current supporters--particularly Tammy Faye. There is no counter-point to their rants. And, since the Bakkers are\/were sociopathic narcissists, much of it needs to be taken with a grain of salt. In other words, the film is not THE definitive history of this sick family but Tammy's version. So, in the documentary, she and her family are often portrayed as victims and the film really does not attempt to discern the truth. The film simply allows this goofy woman to vent, blame others and get attention (which she so desperately craved).This brings me to one problem with the film. Who is the audience? If you want the full story, this is far from complete. If you are easily offended (particularly evangelical Christians), you definitely might want to think twice about watching because there are some nude shots of Jessica Hahn sprinkled throughout the film. However, if you are in the mental health field or law enforcement, it is VERY interesting because you get to see bad people who have absolutely no sense of shame--none. Tammy Faye lived high on the hog for years thanks to her family's pyramid schemes with their 'ministry'--yet blames EVERYONE but herself or her slimy ex-husband, Jim, for their troubles. THIS is fascinating--especially since she had no shame and her focus seemed to be 'look at me-look at me'--a true antisocial-narcissist...as well as very sad, contemptible and pathetic person. Also, Tammy Faye, oddly has become a huge icon in the gay community, so gay men appear to be a target audience for the film and may enjoy the film. Why this is the case, I really not sure--and it may just be a stereotype. All my gay friends just seem too smart to be fans of the Bakkers.So how well does the film do in telling the story? Well, aside from the unnecessary nudity that will definitely put off some, it was engaging and well made--like a slow-motion train wreck that you can't stop watching. The little hand puppets also helped break the tension and bring a lightness to the film that many will appreciate. I wonder, though, if there is another documentary out there that takes a different focus on Bakker tragedy--one that tries to give a more objective slant on things for the uninitiated.By the way, the film ended in 2000. Tammy Faye died from cancer a few years after this--otherwise I am pretty sure we'd be STILL watching her on TV some place today--ANY place willing to give her an audience.Also, one thing about the film I did feel uncomfortable about was its treatment of Jerry Falwell. While he was not my favorite person, to allow the Bakkers to trash him and blame him for ALL their problems without challenging this in any way seemed a bit cheesy. The film did mention that they asked Falwell for comment and he declined, but this all just seemed like a cheap shot. It's fair to attack Falwell for what he specifically said or did but don't let criminals and screwballs lead the charge!

This movie is certainly different from most of Hitchcock's movies. Most of Hitchcock's movies have a certain signature Hitchcock feel to them, much like John Carpenter, Stephen Spielberg, and George Lucas movies have a certain signature feel to them that are vintage Carpenter, Spielberg, and Lucas. Marnie retains a lot of the Hitchcock feel, but this movie is a slight departure from his previous work. This movie really can't be classified into one category, such as a straight psychological thriller, a suspense thriller, a detective story, a mystery, a romance, etc. Whereas most Hitchcock movies put less focus on the characters and more focus on the suspense, Marnie puts most of the focus on one character and less focus on the suspense. This movie is highly personal and psychological. This movie stars 'Tippi' Hedren, Sean Connery, Diane Baker, Louise Latham, Mariette Hartley, Martin Gabel, and Alan Napier. Hedren plays the role of Marnie Edgar, a strange woman with psychological problems who is a professional thief and has an intense fear of men, thunderstorms, and even the color red. To sum up the plot in a nutshell, she empties her employer's safe and escapes. Sean Connery plays the role of Mark Rutland, owner of a publishing company that Marnie applies for a new job at. Marnie robs him as well. However, Rutland is infatuated with her. He tracks her down, but rather than turning her in to the authorities, he convinces her to marry him. While on their honeymoon, he realizes that she actually has a fear of men and fears intimacy. He gets more aggressive with her, resulting in her attempting suicide. Her intense fear of men is rooted in a traumatic childhood experience she had. Watch to find out how everything unfolds. The musical score by Bernard Herrmann is memorable and is one of the strong points of the movie. The score is one of the best of all the Hitchcock movies, in my opinion (my other candidates are Vertigo and Psycho). There are some suspenseful moments. The special effects and some of the sets are pretty simple and low tech, but this doesn't detract from the film at all, in my opinion. The acting is excellent. Sean Connery was excellent. It was great to see Alan Napier in the movie. I thought 'Tippi' Hedren's performance was outstanding. Her acting in The Birds (1963) was great, but she takes things to another level in Marnie. Originally, Hitchcock wanted to cast Grace Kelly in the role of Marnie, but she had to turn it down. I think 'Tippi' Hedren was the perfect actress for the part, and she delivered. I also like Diane Baker in this movie. I have a weakness for movies with good looking women in them. This movie did poorly at the box office when it was released, probably because audiences were used to getting movies that were less personal, less psychological, and more suspenseful from Hitchcock each time, and Marnie was a departure from that. However, this movie's stature has grown immensely since 1964. As for myself, this is one of those rare movies that drew me in right from the start and kept my attention, but multiple viewings might be required in order for one to fully understand and appreciate it for what it is. The DVD's extras include a documentary called The Trouble With Marnie, which basically is about the making of the movie and the movie's historical status, a picture gallery called The Marnie Archives, and the theatrical trailer. Overall, this is a good Hitchcock flick if you're into this type of movie, whatever it's classified as (Hitchcock called it a sex mystery).

In both he plays an enforcer of the law in the future, in both a corrupt official releases a particularly dangerous criminal from a maximum security prison and in both he has a race to defeat his foe before he can release even more danger&#x85; unfortunately the two films are not of equal quality and this is by far the weaker of the two. Stallone plays the eponymous Judge Dredd; a man who rigidly upholds the letter of the law until one day he finds himself sentenced for a murder he didn't commit. The DNA evidence seems irrefutable but he doesn't know he and the perpetrator are clones! The other clone is Rico, a man who has no respect for Dredd's beloved law. As Dredd is being transported to jail the transport shuttle is shot down and he and a petty criminal called Fergie are the sole survivors, they are captured by a group of cannibals but manage to escape and returned to the walled Mega City where they must confront Rico.On the plus side this film packs plenty of action into its short run time and Stallone isn't bad as Dredd even if his 'I knew you were going to say that' catch phrase is far from classic. Rob Schneider who plays Fergie is just irritating though; he is meant to provide comedy relief but is just irritating, Diane Lane is fairly good if terribly underused as Judge Hershey, the film might have been a lot better if her role had been expanded and Fergie dispensed with. The special effects were probably good at the time the film was made but many of them look rather dated now.

If you didn't think that was funny, all I can tell you is that it is probably funnier than 95% of the gags in this film. I will admit that a couple of the gags here and there elicited a few chuckles out of me, but for the most part, I kept watching this film wondering why a production assistant didn't pull Carl Reiner aside and say, Sir, this isn't funny. I recommend shutting down production.I'm betting that 1994 must have made for a hell of a family reunion at the Reiner household. Carl Reiner's son, Rob Reiner, ended his hot streak of memorable films when he released North (1994), the comedy that almost permanently derailed his career. The elder Reiner, who is also no stranger to funny and often times memorable films (The Jerk (1979), The Man With Two Brains (1983)), probably felt the same pain as Rob after releasing this forgettable mess of a film.Fatal Instinct is a comedy that is a spoof, but is sometimes unsure of just what it is spoofing. It is supposed to be a parody of erotic thrillers that came out in the late '80's and early '90's. Of course, there are many references to scenes in Fatal Attraction (1987) and Basic Instinct (1992), hence the name of the film. Scenes from other such thrillers like Sleeping With The Enemy (1991), Body Heat (1981), and Cape Fear (1962 or 1991) are also obviously repeated.There are two problems with this films repeating scenes from these movies. First, the key word is repeat. None of the actors in these scenes even try to reflect the irony of the most memorable moments in these crime thrillers. Sure they reference Sharon Stone's infamous lack of underwear in Basic Instinct, and Glenn Close's roasting a bunny in a pot in Fatal Attraction. Simple referencing of such scenes does not make them funny.Second, the film is rated PG-13, which means kids can see it. Because Basic Instinct and Fatal Attraction were R-rated movies that both came close to being NC-17, kids would not (or should not) have been able to see them. Therefore, any jokes about, or references to, these films, regardless of whether or not they're funny, are going to fly over kids' heads. If you're going to spoof R-rated movies, why not go edgier with the on-screen gags? Kids probably would not want to see the movie anyway, so why did the filmmakers not even think to make this movie R-rated?When the film is not reenacting femme fatale shots from movies adult audience members probably have already seen, it seems as though it inserts infantile gags in an attempt to be The Naked Gun (1988). Armand Assante is a good dramatic actor, but in this movie, it seemed as though he tried way too hard to be Leslie Nielsen. Nielsen was funny in the Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker comedies because he said ridiculous things while keeping a straight face. Assante all too often seemed aware of the absurdity of his lines, and his natural comic timing was usually way off.On top of all those errors, there were a lot of really tired running gags. Seeing gum and toilet paper being stuck to Sean Young's high heels wasn't particularly funny the first time, and was even less the fifth time around. The joke about Assante being both a cop and a lawyer was also about as stupid as his closet being full of the same suit. The film was also inundated with really stupid character names (i.e. Max Shady, Judge Skanky), and horrible, obvious puns.Nowhere were these terrible puns more evident than in the courtroom scene. Once the bailiff called for a ten minute recess, guess what happened next? Yep, all the members of the court went outside and played games. Get it? Like it's recess in elementary school!?!?! Ho ho HO!!!!!! Note By sheer coincidence, there was an equally bad courtroom joke in Rob Reiner's film, North. When the main character's parents are in comatose during his divorce from them, their attorney says, I'm afraid the defense rests. Which joke is worse? You decide.So this film was bad. It had very good actors in it that tried way too hard to be funny, and looked stupid as a result. Even worse, there was really no story. The writer of this film seemed to be so busy naming erotic thrillers that the audience never cares about the fate of the characters in THIS movie. The film spins its wheels while managing to go nowhere. Carl Reiner should be thankful to Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, though. If they hadn't made their awful spoof movies, which are far more guilty of repeating pop culture moments, Fatal Instinct would probably be the worst parody film of all time. It is fatal to watch, and you should trust your instinct by not seeing it.

I haven't been this surprised and pleased with a movie in a long time. I gather from other reviews that it's a bit of a controversial film, and I think its mixed reception is mostly because it confuses some viewers and alienates others. The viewers I imagine are alienated by Blow-Up are the so-called hipsters, the mods of their own time periods.For me, Blow-Up is an allegory about someone who lives in a world of images, of fashion, of trends - a world without substance - unexpectedly finding substance. He then watches as it slips through his fingers and he has no choice but let himself fade back into the void he was in at the onset.The substance that the central character, Thomas the hip photographer, finds is a murder. After photographing what he and the viewer take to be a romantic affair in the park, Thomas infers from the woman's reaction that there's something more there. Indeed, after blowing up the photographs he discovers what he thinks is a murder attempt, instead of what it looked like was going on. This is substance. These pictures are not just trendy attempts at artwork or commerce, as his other work is, but they document something tangible and real.Thomas is overwhelmed - delaying and fumbling his attempt to take action, and eventually failing. Along the strange journey he seems to be confronted with how little substance there is to his life. At an extremely weird rock concert, Thomas fights with the mod masses for a broken guitar neck discarded by the uber-hip band member, and after winning it, he simply tosses it on the street, where a passer-by picks it up and then, seeing no value to it either, discards it as well. This was something the hip people were passionately fighting over, the only thing they seemed to care about, but without knowing its trendy context, it's void of any substance. At the druggy party Thomas then goes to, he is again confronted with the lack of anything meaningful in his world.Returning to the park, the body is gone. Then the troupe of mimes come by for the finale. The most aggressively hip characters of the film, they begin miming a game of tennis. At first, Thomas and the camera are amused at the silliness of the scene, but not drawn into it. Gradually, the camera and Thomas begin to follow the non-existent - substanceless - game. He is falling back into the void. The ball flies over the fence and the mimes send Thomas to pick it up. I thought I saw the outline in the grass where Thomas had seen where the body had previously been. Thomas walks past it, picks up the nonexistent ball and throws it back. Then, camera only on Thomas, he starts to hear the sound of a tennis game. Finally, as the film ends, he fades away into the field of grass. He has bought into the world without substance again.For me, the ending elevated this movie from a mildly amusing avant garde flick - a sort of weird detective story with impressive visuals - into a masterpiece. The ending is so perfect, so beautiful, and so crushing... it does so much without a word being spoken. What a movie! While this movie is sometimes attacked for being too pretentious, I don't think it is at all... it's an attack on pretension! It's wonderful. Bravo.

Sarah is a strong female hero, determined and unwavering. Jareth, the goblin king, can give Sarah anything she wants, and can sense her every desire (as creepy as that sounds). He takes her baby brother away to fulfill a dark desire among older siblings - to be an only child again, the centre of attention. She immediately recognizes the fault in her desire, and asks for Toby back, but Jareth has hidden him in the centre of his labyrinth in the hopes that along the way he can tempt her into leaving her real life behind.Sarah is a girl who lives in a fantasy world, and her appeal to Jareth is a reflection of this, but in the end, her duty to her family and her life is stronger than the pull of the magical world. She fights long and hard, struggling through a maze of tricks and traps to get Toby back, and in the end she faces Jareth and everything he can offer her. She rejects the fantasy of being his queen.Everything I've done, I've done for you. I move the stars for no one.

But I digress; I will give you my thoughts on this one after a brief summary (summary haters and those that don't wish to know anything about the plot please GIVE ME TEN SOLDIER! while I write the next paragraph).It is 1971 and at the U.S. Army Training camp at Fort Polk, Louisiana, the new recruits are getting ready for their eight weeks' training. This will culminate in a visit to the infamous 'Tigerland', an area made to look and feel like Viet Nam. One soldier, Pvt. Roland Bozz, doesn't want to be there and he tries everything he can to get himself discharged, but the Army won't budge. He's a humanitarian who does not want to fight. He is befriended by Pvt. Jim Paxton, an aspiring writer. Bozz is very good at getting people out of the army who have a legitimate reason, and he gains a bit of a reputation for this. The brass doesn't know what to do with him, but he eventually shows leadership qualities and is made platoon Sergeant. This does not go down well with the psychopathic Pvt. Wilson, who takes it personally when Bozz has him removed from the platoon. Eventually they reach the stage where they have to go to Tigerland, and Bozz has a surprise waiting for him there. I've probably said too much, but I'll leave it there so as not to make the Spoiler Police too upset.At first I thought this film is trying so hard to be Kubrick's 1987 classic, Full Metal Jacket, but I was proved wrong. Although it's not quite as good as that, it's still pretty good. Good performances all round, particularly from; Colin Farrell as Bozz, Matthew Davis as Paxton, Clifton Collins Jr. as Miter, Tom Guiry as Cantwell and Shea Whigham as Wilson.As I said at the beginning, I have seen this film before, but I really couldn't remember much about it. On a second viewing, I can see I missed a pretty good film, maybe not brilliant, but certainly a good effort. The picture has kind of a news report feel about it, with slightly washed out colours and quite a bit of hand-held photography.

The book came out at the height of the feminist movement, as more and more women ( mainly American ) began deserting their kitchens and asserting their individuality. Like the author's earlier 'Rosemary Baby', the story also focuses on a young married couple moving to a new neighbourhood where everything is not as it seems. Walter Eberhart ( Peter Masterson ) and wife Joanna ( Katherine Ross ) leave the hustle and bustle of New York for the more sedate Stepford, a town where both the crime rate and taxes are low. She begins noticing a curious phenomenon; local women are gradually losing their personalities, becoming mindless automatons whose only function in life is cooking, cleaning, and keeping their menfolk happy in bed. Her husband joins the local Men's Association - of which every man in the community is a member - run by the creepy Dale Coba ( Patrick O'Neal ), nicknamed 'Dis' because he used to work in Disneyland. Joanna teams up with Bobbie Markowe ( Paula Prentiss ) and they try to get to the bottom of the mystery. The truth is too horrifying for words...Directed by Britisher Bryan Forbes and scripted by William Goldman, 'Stepford Wives' is an engrossing and intelligent movie, the antithesis of Oz's fiasco. The men in Stepford are so scared of feminism they have resorted to quietly killing their wives and replacing them with perfect robot doubles. When Joanna asks Dis why he is doing all this, he replies Because we can!. Like the 'Westworld' androids, the Stepford Wives are capable of sexual intercourse.Katherine Ross shot to fame in Mike Nichols 'The Graduate' ( 1967 ) and then appeared as 'Etta Place' in 'Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid' ( 1969 ). Sadly, her film career never recovered after appearing in Irwin Allen's abysmal 'The Swarm' ( 1976 ). As the enquiring 'Joanna', she is superb, with kooky Paula Prentiss equally impressive as her loud friend Bobbie. Unfortunately, Forbes was unable to resist the temptation of putting wife Nanette Newman in a key role. Goldman's original conception for the Wives was that they all look like Playboy models. But with Newman around, the idea had to be dropped ( even in 1975 she was too mature to convincingly pass for a Raquel Welch type ), hence they are seen pushing trolleys round supermarkets whilst wearing big, floppy hats and long, flowing dresses rather than reclining on beaches in skimpy bikinis. As Goldman pointed out in his book 'Adventures In The Screen Trade', it you are going to spend the rest of your life humping a piece of plastic, it had better be in the shape of Bo Derek, not Nanette Newman. So Forbes' film is flawed, but still worth seeing.Though it performed poorly at the box office, it went on to become a cult classic, inspiring a pair of made-for-television sequels - 'The Revenge Of The Stepford Wives' ( 1979 ) and - if you can believe this - ''The Stepford Children' ( 1987 ).

This film is complex enough to make that overdone plot line incredibly rich and fantastic. Christian is a writer who has come to Paris to experience the bohemian revolution, with a dedication to the ideals of truth, beauty, freedom and, above all things, love. He falls in love with Satine, the Moulin Rouge's head starlette. The intriguing part of this story is what happens when Christian is mistaken for the Duke, an investor in the Moulin Rouge's production of Spectacular Spectacular, a play Christian is writing for a bunch of crazy bohemians. Satine wants to go from courtesan (or the hooker with the prettiest singing voice) to actress, and the Moulin Rouge will subsequently transform from night club (or glorified brothel) to theatre. But they need the Duke's money. He is creepily obsessed with Satine and demands that she... service... only him, in exchange for his funding. To make matters worse, he demands that the deeds to the Moulin Rouge be transfered to him in the case that there be any funny business, which of course there is, because she is giving Christian free service behind the Duke's back.What's so good about Moulin Rouge? Well, to hook the classic rock lovers, it has showy covers of some really great hits - Your Song by Elton John, Heroes by David Bowie, Silly Love Songs by Paul McCartney, Roxanne by The Police, All You Need is Love by The Beatles, and The Show Must Go On by Queen. Also, Madonna, Nirvana, and Whitney Houston. So mostly great rock songs, but there is something for everyone. And who can forget Christina Aguilera with...

Have a few drinks with your first watch and you'll soon find yourself chuckling at the absurd circumstances and nonsensical spectacles. Just trust me.Partway through there is a noticeable shift from ridiculous dance scenes to dramatic, tense ballads. Accompanying the shift in tone is Christian's transition from boy falling in puppy love to insanely jealous lover. Ewan McGreggor does a spectacular job here. Watch how long his goofy grin is plastered on that face, making him the picture of a man falling in love for the first time (don't you know it's gonna last) and then suddenly he is intense and crazed.

Also, Madonna, Nirvana, and Whitney Houston. So mostly great rock songs, but there is something for everyone. And who can forget Christina Aguilera with... OK I forget who... doing Lady Marmelade?The art direction in Moulin Rouge is fabulous... and weird. Very weird. It might take a second watch to really get into the weird comedy as well. Have a few drinks with your first watch and you'll soon find yourself chuckling at the absurd circumstances and nonsensical spectacles. Just trust me.Partway through there is a noticeable shift from ridiculous dance scenes to dramatic, tense ballads. Accompanying the shift in tone is Christian's transition from boy falling in puppy love to insanely jealous lover. Ewan McGreggor does a spectacular job here. Watch how long his goofy grin is plastered on that face, making him the picture of a man falling in love for the first time (don't you know it's gonna last) and then suddenly he is intense and crazed. Flashes of that innocent love can be seen in his expression later, making the transition incredibly flushed out and believable.You're really going to have to take a leap of faith with me if you haven't seen this. The first watch may even be too estranging, but just stay seated for the whole ride, and I promise you will like where you end up. Just... just trust me.

We do take each other for granted.When Tom Hanks finds this ball among shipwrecked goods, he inflates it and paints a face in red on it, and whilst on this island, Wilson, is his only friend, starring at him with a smiling face from a Rock Hanks has placed him on.Personally, I found the relationship between Tom Hanks' character, and his desperate need to create a friend, and talk to it, and even argue with it, more moving than the actual picture.Disaaster movies are two- a penny in Hollywood, even when the relationships have been built up, so we all have someone to root for, to care about. But Tom Hanks, and his friend Wilson, beat the lot of them.I will finish by telling you this, in the raft incident, and Tom Hanks loses Wilson to the sea and it's current, you will feel for Tom Hanks, if you don't, you just ain't human.
