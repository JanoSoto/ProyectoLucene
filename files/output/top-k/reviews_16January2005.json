Still, I have to say that I did find this movie to be quite entertaining and thought it did what it was supposed to do, for a mystery-thriller. It takes off almost immediately, and succeeds in being thoroughly interesting. The plot is pretty good, and experiencing it unravel is pretty intriguing, possibly even more-so than that of other later and contemporary thrillers. The pacing is solid. The acting is good; Freeman is stellar as always, and Potter gives a convincing performance. Wincott surprised me with the high quality of his acting, but maybe that's because I've only seen him in Alien Resurrection, and that movie can make even the most impressive actor seem talentless. Boorem was pretty good for a child-actor, but I have seen better(even at younger ages), so it's no massive accomplishment. The characters are fairly well-written and interesting, but I'm not sure they're entirely credible. The dialog is fairly well-written and equally well-delivered. The special effects are pretty standard stuff, except for a short car-sequence in the beginning which looked entirely convincing. I'm almost certain I know how they did it, but at the moment I saw it, I didn't think about it at all. They pulled that off quite nicely, I think. The film is, like many other recent thrillers, kept going through a number of plot twists, one more unlikely than the other. This is unfortunate, but it seems like that's the way thrillers are going these days. I will say that the twists could have been much, much worse. Overall, a standard mystery-thriller with a good cast and good for at least one attentive viewing. I recommend this to fans of one or more of the actors, the director(if he actually has fans, that is) and\/or of the mystery and thriller genres. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"16 January 2005","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" After seeing The Edge and Mulholland Falls, I can't say I'm really surprised by the quality of this film.

When the final credits rolled, rather creatively at that, I couldn't figure out if this was pure brilliance on the part of Richard Linklater, or if it was nothing more than a group of friends trying to make an independent film. I could not decide. I even listened to the audio commentary of Ethan Hawke and Richard Linklater to see if I could capture their mood of the film to hopefully influence mine. While it was a very interesting audio commentary, it only provided more indecisiveness. After thinking about this for two days, I finally thought about it long enough and realized that if a film makes you think for two days after viewing, there has to be something spectacular about it, and there was. After two days I was able to put my finger on it. You had a very chilling story, a deeply disturbing confession, a powerhouse of acting by Robert Sean Leonard and Uma Thurman, and then there was Ethan Hawke. I put him aside because it was his acting, his portrayal of Vince that took away the inches of film that nearly made it into perfection. Let me explain.This is a story, that on the surface seems small, is very large in structure. While its only setting is inside a motel room, the written word by Stephen Belber transforms this into a thrilling drama about past lives and future consequences. From the opening scene of Hawke throwing his beers into the motel door until the final dramatic conclusion where Vince is caught up in the web of his own lies, we never really know anything about him. Leonard talks briefly about what he is doing and why he is currently single, but we never really get to know Ethan's character. This is what muddled in my mind for those two days, I continually had to ask myself who Vince really was. Was he a friend trying to help Leonard with a guilty conscious, or was he on the side of Amy trying to give her the conclusion that she wanted. Who knows? I think I needed more structure with Ethan's Vince. We needed more from Linklater to help us understand this self-appointed villain, or even more from Ethan to reveal his ultimate purpose. Instead, what occurred was Ethan just jumping around being annoying with no purpose except what you could hear Linklater telling him. Here is what I could hear Ok, Ethan, your purpose in this scene is to ensure that Leonard doesn't leave, do whatever it takes. Ethan takes this direction and adds a couple of swear words and uses screaming to keep him in the room instead of countering with more plot. Does this make sense? I felt like I knew why Leonard and Thurman were there in that room, but WHY Ethan was bringing them together was never told. I know that perhaps it was left up to the viewer, but this story needed a hint. It needed to provide some reasoning for the situation. I felt Ethan held us back from learning that. Someone else in the role may have done better, but Ethan just felt lost and stagy.As I said before, Leonard and Thurman really carried this film on their shoulders. I was impressed to see Leonard taking such heavy work, but his true acting ability really came forth. The same goes for Uma who successfully took the idea of husband and wife away while working with Ethan. I was concerned that it would be a factor in Tape, but luckily these two were able to keep their characters separate. The chemistry that Leonard and Thurman had on screen was shattering. I found myself holding my breath during their parts from both emotion and the tension that they created. Outside of Ethan, they did a great job.The story was a very tight story. I loved being brought into the middle of this controversy and seeing that a world can be created and destroyed in a hotel room. I thought that concept was a hard one to tackle, but Stephen Belber (who also wrote the play) did a fantastic job of eliminating the corporate element and giving us the pure human drama that exists between these characters. Linklater likewise really pulls this film together well by keeping the tensions high and elaborate as our characters progress through the phases of this predicament. The only trouble I had with Linklater's direction deals with his swirling camera. Whenever two people were talking to each other we found ourselves swirling between the two instead of using one large shot or quick cuts. I thought this was annoying at times, and quite dizzying. It detracted from the words that the actors were speaking and from the impact of the story. That is my only critique of Linklater's direction, which was nearly flawless.Overall, this was an impressive and very intense drama that will keep you on the edge of your seat due to its strong reality and human element. It took me a while for me to realize this, and will probably take some time for it to sink into your mind, but that is the nature of this film. It is created to leave this lasting impression on your mind and to haunt your mind during your next visit with friends. I think Linklater did an excellent job with the material that he was handed, proving that his work could be compared to early Cameron Crowe material. Leonard and Thurman explode onto the scene, while Hawke leaves a bit more to be desired. I do believe that Linklater should have considered another actor for his role. Either way, this was a great film that took away the classic Hollywood backdrop and gave us nothing but 100% pure acting.Grade **** out of ***** ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"16 January 2005","score":"51 out of 70 people found the following review useful","review":" This film took me two days to decide whether I liked it or not.

I was the only male human in the crowd, the rest were middle-aged women, no doubt chick flick fans. Not what I expected... I had assumed that I'd have to carve a path through the Corsairs before claiming my seat! The smell of death was all around, the floor slippery with the blood of those slain in battle...Oops, got ahead of myself. I'm a big fan of Robert E. Howard's work, especially Conan (though Solomon Kane is a great character as well). His personal weirdness is well-documented, etc., etc. The film pulls no punches about it at all...This is a film for writers - especially new writers who need to learn the history of American heroic fiction - because the Weird Tales days represented the pinnacle of that genre. It's also a film for high school English teachers; I'd make it mandatory. The reason is that REH's contributions to the body of American literature is genuinely important. Without his successes (he made money off his writing), I suspect August Derleth wouldn't have been as successful at publishing and thus Ray Bradbury wouldn't have been as successful as he is.Everyone watch this film, study this film, seek out Robert E. Howard's books. If you are unfamiliar with the GREAT writing Howard, Lovecraft, Clark Ashton Smith, et al, this film will introduce the early 1930's pulp writer's world to you...As Robert E.

Throughout its entire playtime, Monster's Ball FEELS like a brilliant film but it leaves a gigantic empty feeling in your stomach when you come to think that the drama and the characters you felt so connected with are actually depth-less and unsupported. It is in fact praiseworthy that director Marc Foster manages to fool us during the whole film with utterly simply tricks, as you simply stare at the story's beauty and intensity with great respect and admiration without realizing it's totally fake sentiment you're witnessing. Monster's Ball basically has one trump that makes it all the more appealing for true film buffs the entire production feels very anti-Hollywood! The tone quite unique and some of the subplots and character drawings are highly unlike to feature in a big production like this. Sober, depressing, modest&#133;and even though the story is highly unrealistic and far-fetched, you experience it as a true event simply because it's brought to you so well. Director Marc Foster patiently takes his time to come to the point what the movie actually is about (namely the unusual force of attraction between a Southern white prison guard and an Afro-American mother whose husband was executed on the electric chair) but that is a sublimely elaborated element, as the viewer really feels that what drives the protagonists together is agony, loneliness and death. A lot of suffering takes place before Hank (Billy Bob Thornton) and Leticia (Hally Berry) finally find some consolation and hope with each other. Probably even a little too much, as I rarely some much bitterness featuring in one film.Now, what exactly is wrong with this picture? Because all the things I summed up so far only increase the suspicion that Monster's Ball is an excellent film and a must see for every self-respecting fan of cinema. Well, that's only half true. While the audience is developing sympathy and compassion for the characters' situations, the screenplay fails to enlighten why exactly you do so. I can easily state this with punctual examples but then &#150; of course &#150; you'll be reading huge SPOILERS! We're witnessing how a death row-condemned father (good performance by Sean Combs) is saying goodbye to his family and, although it's very sincere, you don't know whether this sequence is justified. What has he done? Does he even deserve forgiveness? Same goes for the painful relation between the embittered prison guard and his emotionally unstable son Sonny (Heath Ledger). Their interactions are cold and aggressive but not once you're given feedback on what exactly caused this. The abrupt ending of this subplot fills you up (whether immediately or afterwards) with disappointment because you feel the sentiment is exploited and the matter could have been arranged in a different way. There are more examples to state that Monster's Ball' lacks depth but I suggest you see for yourself. Still, I too wish to recommend this film to as many people as possible. Only not for the obvious argument that the story is heart-breaking but simply because it's a professionally shot film. Especially Roberto Schaefer's cinematography is outstanding and shows you camera-angles of which you didn't know they existed. The acting also deserves all the praise it can get. Halle Berry does a fine job but at times it feels like she's hankering too anxiously after her Oscar. If there's anyone here who should have won an Oscar for his performance, it's Billy Bob Thornton but the members of the Academy shamelessly make a rule out of overlooking this brilliant actor. Worth mentioning as well is the remarkable role of Peter Boyle as Thornton's ultra-racist dad.

The rest of the cast are also mostly well cast. Unfortunately one of the things that really disturbs me is Keanu Reeves portraying the important character Renfield. I can't understand why they would choose to use Keanu Reeves with a thick obviously fake accent when there are so many good British actors around. When will film-makers realize that the audience DO appreciate a good actor rather than a big name on the poster?!The focus in this film is on the love story. Something that contributes to the fact that you many times feel sympathetic towards the vampire. And it also lends a warmth to the story that many other similar films lack.

Besides, didn't Bert Gordon warn Eddie not to ever walk into a big time pool again?The defects of COLOR are many and varied but we can begin with the flippant quality of almost all the pool shooting scenes. The Hustler's were completely believable and dripping with authenticity. Fats and fast Eddie were pool players who took tremendous pride in their game and comported themselves with great dignity. The fact that Eddie got drunk and made an ass of himself while losing all his money to Fats was used, quite accurately, to demonstrate a major character flaw. The viewer is actually embarrassed for this giggling fool who a moment before was taking Minnesota Fats apart.In COLOR, the kibitzers are frequently overly boisterous and sometimes seemingly crowding the players. In one scene, Cruise actually sets a beer on the table--an act that would result in a prompt and severe admonishment if not ejection in any decent pool room. All that Samurai stuff with the pool cue would likely have gotten his head taken off. The only character who actually slithered around the table and looked like a shooter was Grady, who showed all the grace of an actual hustler. Everyone else, including Newman and Cruise, basically resemble characters out of the game at the local YMCA. A wasted cameo by Steve Mizerak serves for emphasis.There is no chemistry between Newman and Cruise or between Cruise and the young lady. At no time, despite the major premise of the movie, did I feel that these characters were even vaguely interested in one another.

This is the film that played by the rules while elevating the form, and remains the touchstone for those who talk about Hollywood's greatness.It's the first week in December, 1941, and in the Vichy-controlled African port city of Casablanca, American ex-pat Rick Blaine runs a gin joint he calls Rick's Cafe Americaine. Everybody comes to Rick's, including thieves, spies, Nazis, partisans, and refugees trying to make their way to Lisbon and, eventually, America. Rick is a tough, sour kind of guy, but he's still taken for a loop when fate hands him two sudden twists A pair of unchallengeable exit visas, and a woman named Ilsa who left him broken-hearted in Paris and now needs him to help her and her resistance-leader husband escape.Humphrey Bogart is Rick and Ingrid Bergman is Ilsa, in roles that are archetypes in film lore. They are great parts besides, very multilayered and resistant to stereotype, and both actors give career performances in what were great careers. He's mad at her for walking out on him, while she wants him to understand her cause, but there's a lot going on underneath with both, and it all spills out in a scene in Rick's apartment that is one of many legendary moments.Casablanca is a great romance, not only for being so supremely entertaining with its humor and realistic-though-exotic wartime excitement, but because it's not the least bit mushy. Take the way Rick's face literally breaks when he first sees Ilsa in his bar, or how he recalls the last time he saw her in Paris The Germans wore gray, you wore blue. There's a real human dimension to these people that makes us care for them and relate to them in a way that belies the passage of years.For me, and many, the most interesting relationship in the movie is Rick and Capt. Renault, the police prefect in Casablanca who is played by Claude Rains with a wonderful subtlety that builds as the film progresses. Theirs is a relationship of almost perfect cynicism, one-liners and professions of neutrality that provide much humor, as well as give a necessary display of Rick's darker side before and after Ilsa's arrival.But there's so much to grab onto with a film like this. You can talk about the music, or the way the setting becomes a living character with its floodlights and Moorish traceries. Paul Henreid is often looked at as a bit of a third wheel playing the role of Ilsa's husband, but he manages to create a moral center around which the rest of the film operates, and his enigmatic relationship with Rick and especially Ilsa, a woman who obviously admires her husband but can't somehow ever bring herself to say she loves him, is something to wonder at.My favorite bit is when Rick finds himself the target of an entreaty by a Bulgarian refugee who just wants Rick's assurance that Capt. Renault is trustworthy, and that, if she does a bad thing to secure her husband's happiness, it would be forgivable. Rick flashes on Ilsa, suppresses a grimace, tries to buy the woman off with a one-liner (Go back to Bulgaria), then finally does a marvelous thing that sets the whole second half of the film in motion without much calling attention to itself.It's not fashionable to discuss movie directors after Chaplin and before Welles, but surely something should be said about Michael Curtiz, who not only directed this film but other great features like Captain Blood and Angels With Dirty Faces. For my money, his Adventures Of Robin Hood was every bit Casablanca's equal, and he even found time the same year he made Casablanca to make Yankee Doodle Dandy. When you watch a film like this, you aren't so much aware of the director, but that's really a testament to Curtiz's artistry. Casablanca is not only exceptionally well-paced but incredibly well-shot, every frame feeling well-thought-out and legendary without distracting from the overall story.Curtiz was a product of the studio system, not a maverick like Welles or Chaplin, but he found greatness just as often, and Casablanca, also a product of the studio system, is the best example. It's a film that reminds us why we go back to Hollywood again and again when we want to refresh our imaginations, and why we call it the dream factory.

With a fantastic music score,flashy cars,fantastic fight scenes(both from kung fu master 'Seagul' and rapper 'DMX')to its pretty good storyline.I'd give this film 8 and a half out of 10.If you haven't seen this film yet-I'd highly recommend you watching it on DVD as the extras (Deleted scenes,making of,behind the scenes and music video) are also all highly entertaining. Best viewed and heard through a 5.1 surround sound set up, as it enhances the film and its action further through its quality sound!

One of my fav action films of modern time. DMX out plays and out acts Seagul in my opinion. Which is rare to see from rappers who turn their hand to acting.Don't get me wrong though, Seagul does deliver. Seeing as though the other reviews have pretty much got everything covered about this hit film, i won't go on too much! Some excellent music (if your into the rap\/hiphop scene) inc the main soundtrack by DMX himself (An interesting cover with a rap angle on it of Bill Withers\/Al ????'s 'Ain't no sunshine') Which i think is a really good version (and i do love the original as well) The rest of the cast have been cast carefully and all actors are perfect for their respective rolls.

Sounds interesting? Well, it is, in that one must be so in love with their city to want to show it to the world through a series of small stories and shots of random happenings. I can relate I have the same love for Melbourne.We shift from a portrayal of Fellini as a schoolboy with dreams of going to Rome, to a depiction of Fellini as a young man, moving to the city he always wanted to live at. There's also scenes of early 1970s theatre attendance, the almost ritual-like eating habits of the Romans, and then we move onto a documentary-like part of the film where we get to see Fellini's camera crew struggle as they try to capture the hustle and bustle of the entrance into Rome via a major highway, filled with drifters, animals, trucks, hitch-hikers, bikes, and more.The constant changing in scenes and stories is a bit messy, and could possibly confuse those not understanding what Fellini is trying to do with the film. At some times, I found myself questioning whether what we were being shown was a realistic dramatization of Fellini's past experiences, or some kind of farcical take on Roman culture (see the religious clothing fashion show scene!). The film is quite intriguing, taking in the sexual revolution of the era and putting it up against a city full of tradition. We are also exposed to some of the city's dirty little secrets, such as the surprising popularity of their whorehouses.It can't be denied that there is something endearing to Roma that allows Fellini to get away with a film that doesn't really give you much to take home with you, other than an idea of what Rome was like for someone in 1972, and what kind of life was lead to come to those perceptions. It is somewhat self indulgent, but Fellini does put across the impression that he has something to show you, something he'd like to share with you, because he has loved it for so long, and it still fascinates him on a daily basis.

A film with Jim Carrey that's supposed to have emotional content? But after seeing his performance in Eternal Sunshine I rented The Majestic and was positively surprised.First I would like to remark on the setting of this film, it's placed in 1950's America during the years of Communist Witchhunt's of which the lead, played by Carrey becomes a victim. The film makes a real effort to create this atmosphere and I have to say it pulls it of very nicely, creating believable space for Carrey to act out his role's frustration.After the summons to appear before the committee Carey starts drinking heavily and get's into a car-crash which gives him amnesia. A river washes him to a small town where he is believed to be a prodigal son. The amnesia and mistaken identity aren't new, especially in the literary world, but the given is used in a very fresh and eloquent way, I registered the fact, but was never annoyed by it.The village of Lawson is portrayed in such a way that it really seems to be a living, breathing town with it's little rarities and interpersonal currents. In many ways I was surprised by the quality of acting in the villagers that made it all so 'real'.If I give it all this praise, then why the seven. A fair question that's easy enough to answer. Although it's easy to see how this movie can be turned into a moralizing story about Communist Hunt's, the right of Free Speech and 'Our Boy's Fighting For Democracy' my biggest surprise was that half way in the movie, it still hadn't moved into this morale. Sure it leaned (sometimes heavily) on these themes, but always believable and relevant (the fallen sons are an integral part to create the setting of the town and 'Luke's' return)But it seems that with half an hour to go the director remembered his mission and sets out to make 'a great American movie about Democracy' but this film isn't the vehicle to that end. It suffers a bit of over-romanticizing in the end, making believability (the strength of it in the beginning) an issue. It has to be said that Paul's speech to the commission is very neatly nuanced, which I really liked and redeemed the film in my eyes. In a non-patronizing way that maybe he did a good deed, he's not the player that makes the rules. So take a 10, account for not always great acting mostly caused by the fact that some relations between people have to be rushed for the script to work, account for the ending then a 7 is a very nice grade.

The story is of a man (Julius Benedict, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger) who grows up on a tropical island with a scientist, and knows nothing of modern society. Then one day he finds out he has a twin brother in L.A. He was also told that his mother died giving birth to him and his brother. When he gets to L.A. he finds his brother, who appears to be nothing like him, sort of an opposite person entirely, although they share some things in common. Julius is very pleasant, sensible, intelligent, Vincent, his brother, is a petty car thief and always getting into trouble. Julius goes looking for where their mother lived and finds she is gone. He finds one of his 6 fathers, but not his mother. He is given an address in New Mexico to find a scientist who was at his birth.

He goes with his brother Vincent to find the scientist, who tells them their mother is alive and well and living near Santa Fe. So they go off looking for her, find her but don't realise it, as she thinks they are tricking her. She was lied to as well, being told that her son was dead, and nothing about the twin son who was born 1 minute later.Add to that some villains chasing the brothers as Vincent is driving a stolen car with a secret jet engine stored in the back, and some comedy along the way, and some magnificent scenery along the way.I thought the relationship between the two twins was great, very well done, and believable. What they said about being a family was very moving. And at the end it all works out well.An excellent film about relationships, family, and what is important in life, and about how to do the right thing, when at the end the twins do the right thing and get rewarded.I recommend this film. If you view it as a violent movie about beating the criminals, it can work on that level, if you view it as a comedy it is quite good too, but as a film about family and relationships is where it really works best, view this with an open heart.
