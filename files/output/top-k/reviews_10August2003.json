Seen in pieces, that is seeing each scene as individual and separate from the whole, this isn't a terrific film, but when the pieces go together, as with the movie experience, it definitely becomes more than the sum of it parts. A sweet fable, a silly comedy along with something to think about.Christina Ricci and Hank Harris are a great screen couple. Sam Ball also deserves a round of applause for his performance! Bravo Sam! This film was so enjoyable, it reminded me of films like `Revenge Of The Nerds', `Election' and the terrific `Ray Bradbury's The Wonderful Ice-Cream Suit'. When you need a lift a good romantic comedy always does the trick, this one does the trick, and puts a little twist on the usual formula!

Then there was Brad Hamilton played by Judge Reinhold, in one of his best parts, and his sister Stacy, played by Jennifer Jason Leigh, and there are many more interesting characters in the film.  The film had a lot of sex in the movie for the day. In the film there were some incredibly mature themes brought up like masturbation, abortion, teen sex, drug use and some other interesting things.It is a fun movie to watch and very funny.  The movie has no real definitive ending that raps up the entire situation and that is what makes this movie so endearing is that it is just people at this high school interacting and living very much for lack of a better term in the fast lane.  And unlike some of these teen movies today there is a conscious in this film and it is not one of these stupid gross out films like the crappy American Pie.What interested me as well are all of the famous actors that were in this movie before they became famous, like Judge Reinhold, Sean Penn, Phoebe Cates, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Anthony Edwards, Nicholas Cage, Forrest Whitaker and a few others.  Judge Reinhold does the best job here out of all the actors, he just seems so natural in his part.  Ray Walston who plays a high school teacher is also very funny in this film.

In the end, you just roll with it to see what happens.  Any way, David Duchovny and Orlando Jones did fine, Duchovny played his part with a dry sense of humor, while Jones could have used some funnier lines. Sean William Scott did a great job with his part, the lovable goof. Juliane Moore isn't going to make anyones favorite actor list based on this movie, not her fault, the part was kind of lame.  Dan Aykkroyd came on as the governor of Arizona toward the end and spewed hilarious bombast like the Aykroyd of old. I can't believe that some said there were no funny scenes in this flick the shotguns in the mall was real fun and Aykroyd's scenes were worth the price of admission. Good but not great, I would recommend it. ","genre":"Comedy, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"10 August 2003","score":"","review":"  I first saw this movie in 1994 when I was 10 years old and I loved it even then.

Directed by M. Night Shyamalan. I have to say that before seeing this movie, I was bracing myself for a disappointment due to mixed reviews. I must now say that I found the movie to be quite remarkable, well executed, and nicely crafted. M. Night Shyamalan rightly deserves respect for putting out a film with a lot of his personal touches instead of putting out something that people expect to see. While `Signs' will have scenes of the traditional or convention variety, it is the ambiance of the scenes that is unique.Shyamalan made good use of the films lead actors. Mel Gibson as recent widower Graham Hess, and Joaquin Phoenix as the younger brother Merrill Hess are both well cast and interesting to watch. They both brought a lot to the movie. Shyamalan himself has a somewhat key supporting role in the movie as well.It was a good choice to make the movie focus on the Hess family instead of the global distress of an alien invasion. The few times that we did see an alien during the middle of the movie was really frightening. Especially the first time Graham Hess (Gibson) sees one right outside the window of his children's bedroom. I believe we see an alien (or part of one) seven times in the movie, and the first six appearances were only for a split second, at first I was dissatisfied that we didn't see more. Yet in hindsight, less appearances of an alien does accomplish more for the movie.We never find out why the aliens were invading, but the viewer does realize that they were hostile. Here is one qualm that I have with this movie, it seemed a little illogical to me that the aliens would think that humans wouldn't realize their (the aliens) weakness since this substance is so abundant on our planet.`Signs' really held my attention and I highly recommend it.

In their ending battle with Random Trekkie Bad Guy No. 12-or-something (Malcolm McDowell) you're not sure whether our two heroes will save the day or suffer from strokes and lose their denchers - or both.What's with Trekkies anyway?  What's so appealing about Star Trek?  A bunch of guys in bad makeup and near-Spandex suits shooting laser guns that resemble T.V. remote controls at aliens with bad makeup?  Oh yay!  I mean, the aliens aren't even original!  The Klingons are Jamaican people with weird horns.  The Vulcans are elves who are also (very) boring.  All the cool and far out aliens are skinny people with...bad makeup.  There are no Rancor-like monsters.  No psychological aliens ala It from A Wrinkle In Time.  Geez, the aliens in parody Galaxy Quest were cooler than this.And don't expect the acting to be any good.  The actors are all still stuck on that T.V. thing.  I don't think they realize that movie acting takes a little extra effort.  Except for maybe Stewart, who I'd say is the best actor of the entire series.  Though, that's not saying very much really.Anyway, Star Trek Generations is a sappy, boring, cheesy movie of a sappy, boring and cheesy franchise, 5\/10.

I know alot of you will probably disagree, but it's a classic. Neve Campbells performance is amazing. That girl can act!!!! I was very disappointed at one thing though. I did not like to see Miss Jada Pinkett-Smith killed off so quickly. I think she would have been a great addition to the story had she been able to stick around longer. She's always been one of my favorite actresses. The whole plot of the movie is genius. There are no movies out there like the Scream Trilogy!!  Not only are they scary, they are hilarious. If you want to get scared and laugh your @ss off while doing it.....you need to see these movies.
