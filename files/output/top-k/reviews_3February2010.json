It is my personal favorite of his movies, along with being one of my all time favorite action movies, and one of my favorite movies in general. It's truly an awesome film to watch, with enough action and suspense to fill 10 action movies, and is a must see for any true action movie fan.The Story The story follows Tequila Yuen, a hard boiled cop (See, just like the title!) whose partner is killed in the opening shootout of the movie. He has become obsessed with taking down Hong Kong's biggest gun smuggling gang, led by Johnny Wong. Along the way he meets up with an undercover cop, and the two must team up to take down Johnny's gang. The story is altogether pretty simple, but it really works for this movie, which focuses more on character development and action than on having a complex story.The Characters Chow Yun Fat's character Tequila is by far one of the most bad-ass characters to ever come on screen in action cinema. He is an awesome character, who is nearly invincible in a gunfight, and never hesitates to pull the trigger when necessary. Chow Yun Fat proves himself yet again to be a great actor, and plays Tequila perfectly, and he alone makes Tequila one of my all time favorite action heroes. It also serves to remind me about how much I miss Chow Yun Fat making action movies, for he is by far one of the best action stars out there.Tony Leung's character, the undercover cop known only throughout the movie as Alan, is also a great character, proving himself to be almost as bulletproof and bad ass as Tequila. He also adds a lot of drama to the story, as his reluctance to kill people in order to infiltrate the gang makes for a couple of excellent scenes.Also, I feel I should mention Johnny Wong, who is played really well by Anthony Wong Chau-Sang, who makes the character a ruthless and evil as villains come in action movies, willing to murder dozens of innocent people to keep his gun smuggling operation from failing. I really hated the guy by the end of the movie, which is a good sign that he is played well.The Action Ahh, the action. This movie's strongest point is it's action scenes, which are incredibly well shot and as awesome as they can get. The shootouts in the tea house at the beginning and the hospital at the end should be recognized as some of the best action scenes ever shot in the history of cinema. This is also the movie that features the legendary hallway tracking shot, which is one of the most well choreographed shootouts of all time. And considering that it was all done in one take, I'd say it was pretty damn impressive. John Woo also held no punches when it came to making this film, allowing it to be fast, brutal and bloody as hell, a style that I greatly missed when it came to his later films. The action can switch between being ultra-cool to almost disturbingly brutal in parts, especially when it comes to the enormous death toll of innocent people in the various scenes. It should also be noted that this movie has one of the highest action movie body counts of all time, with a grand total of 289 deaths in the film. Tequila himself takes out 76 criminal scumbags, and Alan takes out somewhere around 45 himself. John Woo really outdoes himself in the action scenes in this movie, and does nothing but prove himself to be the greatest action director of all time.The Overview Altogether, this truly is one of the greatest action movies of all time, and John Woo proves himself to be not one of but the greatest action director ever. Chow Yun Fat is at his best, and this was probably in my opinion his last great action movie. Hard boiled is an action classic, and should be viewed by any action movie fan, who I guarantee will not be disappointed.

Its DVD is in my archive and I watched it a few times and still watch some scenes sometimes and each time, I appreciate the director. Behind Enemy Lines recalls John Woo movies in terms of style in action scenes, but it is much more better than some John Woo movies in fact (you know, he has started to be disappointing) Behind Enemy Lines is a special movie, if you ask me besides being very very enjoyable and stylish, because it is not just fun, it is very well shot. Firstly, I want to talk about some scenes. There are some scenes that I just love and think that some of the best action scenes ever made! The jet fall scene is the best one, there is no better one. Even if some moments (special effects) look superficial, a great action sequence and a great demo scene too. The mine scene is my favorite, not only in the movie, this action scene is one of the bests ever made too. Each time, I am amazed and impressed. I cannot describe this scene. Then, the shooter comes to the scene and we say wow! This is a cat and mouse game also, even if it is weak in comparison with other cat and mouse games. The scene takes place in front of the ramshackle building is another astonishing action scene, but there is much more than that. The only thing disappointing is the entrapment in the final part. I had expected an interesting or smart or something big, but disappointed. As for Owen Wilson, many people agree that he is not appropriate for an action movie and they say that the movie would have been better without him. I absolutely disagree. He was perfect. He proved that a comedy actor can be better than some action stars. To me, he is better than Mark Wahlberg or better than cold Vin Diesel. Now, it is time for the reviews, the reviews of some people including critics. The extremely frustrating and sometimes ridiculous reviews. This is a movie that critics would give maximum 6. They say that Behind Enemy Lines is an ideological movie, it is a propaganda movie, it is one sided, it shows Serbians as evil and so on... You see, always the same stuff. They say the movie brainwashes us, I ask who brainwashes who? I hate this. And there is one more ridiculous comment from a critic. The movie advertises cola. It says don't drink water, drink cola. Hmm, really? How do those critics's brains work? What about cinema? Do directors who want to make a war movie have to make two movies for each front? No. If there won't be any bad guy, how can you make a movie that is about a pilot whose aircraft is fallen and tries to survive behind enemy lines? Recently I have seen a few action movies like Shooter. It was a very slow paced action movie and also action was mild besides being very less.

And we also have two great villains played by Lance Henriksen and Arnold Vosloo these two have to be the most evil pair of villains to ever be in an action movie as they just show no mercy of torturing or killing people they even make jokes about their victims while killing them.But what really makes Hard Target Special is the action scenes, considering this was John Woo's first American film he really put a lot of work into the action, and he has never repeated the insanity and unrealistic nature of it ever since, and the reason for that is Hard Target was not received well by the critics, the critics complained that it was ridiculously over the top and unrealistic, as well as criticizing the plot, and considering that it was made by John Woo, who's films prior to Hard Target are masterpieces of Hong Kong drama and action, and the critics were just appalled by Hard Target.Overall But I think Hard Target was a great movie, the critics were just expecting way too much, did they not notice that Van Damme was the star?, when you go to see a Van Damme movie you go to see him do what he does best, Beat the Tar out of people, so as a Van Damme movie it's definitely impressive in terms of Quality, The action and stunts are great, the villains are brilliant and the plot may not be original but it holds the movie together nicely, and it's definitely the last of the old school John Woo action style which John Woo had to water down in his later American films Because the critics and some of the general public didn't buy his style of action, But I highly recommend Hard Target for any hardcore action movie fan out there, just sit back relax don't take it too seriously and you'll have fun. 8\/10BTW The best version of the film is the Region 2 and Region 4 DVD release as 5 minutes of action has been restored, it may not seem like much but trust me it makes a huge difference especially in the final shoot out. with a good surround sound system it'll be one hell of a ride!.

And we also have two great villains played by Lance Henriksen and Arnold Vosloo these two have to be the most evil pair of villains to ever be in an action movie as they just show no mercy of torturing or killing people they even make jokes about their victims while killing them.But what really makes Hard Target Special is the action scenes, considering this was John Woo's first American film he really put a lot of work into the action, and he has never repeated the insanity and unrealistic nature of it ever since, and the reason for that is Hard Target was not received well by the critics, the critics complained that it was ridiculously over the top and unrealistic, as well as criticizing the plot, and considering that it was made by John Woo, who's films prior to Hard Target are masterpieces of Hong Kong drama and action, and the critics were just appalled by Hard Target.Overall But I think Hard Target was a great movie, the critics were just expecting way too much, did they not notice that Van Damme was the star?, when you go to see a Van Damme movie you go to see him do what he does best, Beat the Tar out of people, so as a Van Damme movie it's definitely impressive in terms of Quality, The action and stunts are great, the villains are brilliant and the plot may not be original but it holds the movie together nicely, and it's definitely the last of the old school John Woo action style which John Woo had to water down in his later American films Because the critics and some of the general public didn't buy his style of action, But I highly recommend Hard Target for any hardcore action movie fan out there, just sit back relax don't take it too seriously and you'll have fun. 8\/10BTW The best version of the film is the Region 2 and Region 4 DVD release as 5 minutes of action has been restored, it may not seem like much but trust me it makes a huge difference especially in the final shoot out. with a good surround sound system it'll be one hell of a ride!. But i just hope that one day we'll get a true director's cut of the film.

From the blue Aegean Sea to the nasty back alley Balkan partisan war in Yugoslavia, the characters played by Gregory Peck and David Niven now played by Robert Shaw and Edward Fox are sent back into the fight on another undercover mission. Or on a pair of them.This time they're joined by Americans Harrison Ford and Carl Weathers on the team. And the boys have two missions to accomplish. Ford and Weathers have to get a bridge blown up so the Germans can't move heavy concentrations of troops. Colonel Alan Badel of the partisans has some limited forces at his disposal to stop them if they don't. But there's also an agent in the partisan camp and that's Shaw's job, to kill the traitor.If you remember The Guns Of Navarone best try and put it out of your mind because this film isn't nearly as good. If you remember that film, Gregory Peck's character was that of a mountain climber and his part in that mission was to get that team up the steep face of a cliff where the Germans wouldn't be looking. He was not a trained assassin as Shaw is. But I'm guessing the screenplay authors forgot that little detail when they wrote this film.The Sixties and Seventies were the decade when black players began to get all kinds of roles and stopped being in the stereotyped parts that they had been relegated to before. In fact though in some cases they were shoehorned into situations that just wouldn't have applied. Such is the case for Carl Weathers who there is no way a black man would have been on this kind of mission back in the day. The Armed Forces weren't even integrated until after World War II. But the script went through all kind of hoops to make sure Weathers was kept well hidden while the rest of the team blended with the surroundings.But beyond that Force 10 From Navarone resembles one of those propagandistic films from the World War II era where the Nazis were often played as incredibly stupid. It most resembles that Errol Flynn action film Desperate Journey, one of the dumber A films to come out from that era. Harrison Ford was fresh from his breakthrough starring role as Han Solo in Star Wars and I guess this was kind of training for his later Indiana Jones films. But Force 10 From Navarone doesn't have the color and élan of any Indiana Jones pulp film. The force was not with this movie.

The first thing that makes this movie is the humor. it is not overused like most people would do to it for this kind of film, but Tom Mcloughlin knows what we Jason followers like and he delivers an excellent sequel. then of course, since its Friday the 13th, why not have some great kills? Well, this movie has just that, but it works, and it doesn't seem forced, like Jason has to kill him because he's a 2-D character that we don't want haunting the script. nope, all the characters are actually kind of likable, and for once, I felt that we weren't overpopulated with horny adolescents. Jason slaughters them, sure, but this time, he's killing counselors. I mean yeah, maybe that Hawes fella was a bit goofy, but he got one hell of a way out, so if you think about, you almost sympathize with these victims, rather than just Jason, but as always, you side with the Big J and just have fun. its a tradition. Characters are developed and this is actually my favorite part of the film. the funny characters. now, atmosphere. is it scary? well, thinking what i said about humor, you might think this one is one to skip if you looking for a good scare, but there is a very intense scene with Jason getting ready to take out camper Paula by redecorating the cabin with her-Jason loves red. but, the door blows open, Paula goes to close, nothing happens. its actually is pretty creepy in its own right, and for that I really love it and congratulate it. Another strong point is the score. no Harry Manfredini this time round, just Alice Cooper! yeah, my favorite song of his, it really does kinda put you in Crystal Lake. The acting is superb. the best for all Friday sequels ( I love John D.

Thinking back, this was a milestone for me my first gay themed movie and before I was out. It was when I was barely beginning to know what the gay lifestyle was all about. Thankfully, I didn't take it all to heart, as this was not only more than a gay themed movie, but it's also a much darker side as well as just one aspect of the lifestyle, namely prostitutes.Of course, it helped, I was in love with River Phoenix at the time (who, sadly passed on a few years later.) And it opened &#x96; wide open &#x96; the future viewings of independent cinema. After watching this now, the very first time since late 1991, I can see this is the epitome of independent movies.Mike (Phoenix) suffers from a lot of what life dealt with him, namely and most obviously, narcolepsy. He's lost (literally) and holds on to his one love, Scott (Reeves) and his hope of reuniting with his mother. Scott takes care of him, and shows the one human side to his character looking out for poor\/always falling (again, literally) into a deep, uncontrollable sleep.Mike lives on the street, hustling to mostly men in order to survive, but through his many sicknesses. Meanwhile, best bud, also street hustler Scott is set to inherit a rather large amount of money on his 21st birthday within the week from when the movie begins. Scott hopes to just live it up with his zany co-prostitutes and street robbers\/sex-for-hires until he can safely turn his life into fame and fortune. But, again, he continues to take care of Mike and furthers his journey (possibly as a way to break up the boredom) to reunite with the mother of his memories.In a time where gay was still relatively taboo, I applaud Gus Van Sant for making the movie he wanted to, despite the still-general public ignorance. It's rather weird, and certainly not mainstream by any means. And having it not only based solely on the Shakespeare play of Henry IV and V, you'll truly feel that theatre presence in many of the scenes.In addition, the movie is mostly a sad romantic road picture about wandering and lost souls. At least you have a character to root for (Mike) and as sick as he is (inside\/out,) you'll want to find his lost home. His lost mother.The movie's only real downfall you'll experience &#x96; that is, if you didn't get most of the symbolism, or what Gus Van Sant was trying to say &#x96; is, once again, Reeves. He continues to prove himself to be the world's worst actor. Ever. Phoenix and the rest of the cast were not only astonishing and believable, yet, Reeves is as wooden and stale as a 30-year-old fallen dead tree. As in most of his movies, it's as if he's standing as erect as he can while reading cue cards. How he would benefit if film students would simply give him some acting lessons.Nevertheless, the rest of the movie has wonderful cinematography and good music.

But before i will tell you about all the things i like about it i gonna rant about the things i don't like(HERE ARE SOME SPOILERS BUT I WON'T GIVE AWAY ANY THING IMPORTANT) First, Keanu Reeves. WTF?!!! What he is doing can hardly be called acting! Come on, show some expression! Coppola should have hired Johnny Depp or Heath Ledger(RIP). Whouldn't what been awesome? Heath Ledger instead of Reeves. Second, the Brides Of Dracula(by the way, if Dracula loves Elisabetha\/Mina so much why would he have THREE other wives?! If those were his children i could get it but his BRIDES?). What is the deal with the rape of Keanu Reeves? It seemed blood wasn't the only thing they sucked... P It just seemed so weird. I saw a musical version of Dracula with a similar scene, but they did it much better.But what is the good things about this movie? Everything else! Anothny Hopkins, Winona Ryder, Tom Waits and the others a great! But above all others are GARY OLDMAN. This is the role he was born to play. Why he didn't get an Oscar is a mystery to me. I am starting to think the academy is not as great as it seems. Oldman succeeds in making the count both sinister and sympathetic. It's sympathy for the devil.The love story of the movie is so much better and more complex than the one from recent vampire stories such as Twilight. The music goes perfect with the beautiful images. If you are thinking of watching a vampire movie for the first time out want to show one to your kids for the first time, make it this one.

To try and dodge copyright laws, he changed all of the character's names from Bram Stoker's book and fiddled with the story. The end result is a very creepy, atmospheric film &#x96; the performance of Max Schrek gives us the most disturbing portrayal of the Dracula character, one that is quite different from the suave and charming Dracula of Bela Lugosi. I've seen this movie twice now, and both times I was a little let down. Like I said, the atmosphere is great, but the story itself just left me feeling like there should have been more to it. The beginning really got me interested, but slowed down for me when Orlock leaves Transylvania. Don't get me wrong, there are some great scenes after that, such as when Orlock reveals himself on the boat or when Hutter gets a ride in a very creepy carriage, but the story or maybe the pacing just doesn't quite do if for me. The ending especially is a big let down, I was expecting something much more.Like I said, I have seen this movie twice. The first time I saw it, it was a horrible transfer with no tinting and an awful score that did not match the creepiness of the film at all. For my second viewing, I saw the Kino version, a great improvement. The transfer was beautiful, all the scenes were tinted, and the soundtrack was said to be the original score. I believe that my first viewing of Nosferatu has ruined it for me. Do not watch the version that gives the characters their original book names, it's horrible. Make sure you get the Kino version, you'll have a much better experience. Go into this with no expectations and it will probably turn out better for you than it did for me.I give this 7\/10, the eeriness of it made up a lot for my disappointment in the story. I guess you could say I respect it more than I like watching it. ","genre":null},{"date":"3 February 2010","score":"","review":" As most people know, this is Murnau's version of Dracula.

Whilst it would be buffoonery to deny that such things have always come out of the Disney studio, the association with silliness and fabricated maternal comfort really discredits the likes of Pinocchio. Based on the Italian author Carlo Collodi's story about the puppet with a knack for getting into trouble, it was only the second animated feature put out by Disney. It is also perhaps the best animated film to have seen the light of day - yes, even beating Toy Story and all of the other beloved Pixar films.Technically speaking, everything that Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs did well is done even better in Pinocchio; the scope and attention to detail are greater, the music and songs are of a higher level (When You Wish Upon a Star has indeed gone on to become the anthem of Disney and of hope in general) and the animation seems more confident and fluid. Yet the main reason Pinocchio works is that it truly seizes upon the opportunity of going beyond being merely a fantastical fable and provides a story that resonates with the soul of an individual in the world of reality. It doesn't simply patronise or moralise the audience; as with a select other few films including The Wizard of Oz, E.T. and Amélie, the fantasy on screen succeeds so well in that it truly parables that of an everyday society devoid of magic - and allows for criticism of accepted attitudes.In creating a mythical world, the plot is truly complex and deals with with so many timeless themes in some form or another - responsibility, love, morality and exploitation are just some examples. It equally strays very much from being a pick-me-up in the way that the likes of Snow White and Sleeping Beauty might be, and there are countless truly thrilling or downright scary moments, in particular the scene in which the lazy yet naive delinquent Lampwick meets his fate. There are far more antagonists in Pinocchio than the average Disney favourite, all of whom - unlike the numerous femmes fatales and odious beings in other films - do not appear on screen after their subsequent wrong doings and arguably remain unpunished, much like the villains of everyday life. One can thus imagine that Honest John and Gideon are conning even more victims or that the systematic horrors of Pleasure Island shall continue. This is what truly makes the scenes of cruelty so disturbing; underneath all of its fantastical trimmings, its sheer acceptance certainly resonates with a society of any generation (consider that this film was made and released simultaneously to policies of appeasement and the ultimate road to war).Yet there are moments of happiness, hope and joy in Pinocchio, and their place in a film often so frank with the often questionable behaviour of a society makes them all the more wonderful and joyous. Pinocchio is quite frankly one of the best things ever captured on celluloid.

But it was one of the last blossoms of a dying genre. It represents classical western, perhaps classical cinema -- old life? It's a summary of the genre's deepest emotions. A depiction of a community at the dawn of the new world in which garden and wilderness, untamed west and civilization are against each other. The film is also talks about democracy, the spine of civilization and its significance. It was an untypical film for John Ford, and it was the first film in which James Stewart and John Wayne played together, both of whom had earlier worked with Ford.John Ford's puzzling mystery of history and humanity is built on the relationship between two men but the character of Hallie, played by Vera Miles, turns their relationship into a love triangle as well. A senator, Ransom Stoddard (James Stewart) arrives to a town because a friend of his, Tom Doniphon (John Wayne) has died; so discretely that the press hadn't even heard of it. Soon the senator has to tell the press the story; why has he returned to the town and who was this friend of his -- it all begun... Soon we find out that before Stoddard the town was dominated by a notorious villain, Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin). Stoddard desperately tried to end his reign of terror by sowing the seeds of democracy and civilization.The film is both bitter and touchingly idealistic. In addition to its social themes of justice, free speech and education, the film drills down to pure emotion, to the thematics of humanity, love and morality. The characters of James Stewart and John Wayne represent two opposite worlds Wayne's the old world where the law of the jungle reigns. In turn, Stewart's the new world with its laws and teachings. Stewart's character tries to change the town without order or law into a model of democracy but finds it incredibly hard when Liberty Valance reminds him of the cruel reality of the wild west.The overlap of time levels and perspective technique are masterful and precisely considered; both the gags and the most serious scenes work perfectly. The scene where Liberty Valance arrives to the restaurant is one gorgeous example Ransom (Stewart) comes to deliver Tom (Wayne) his steak but Liberty trips him up and the steak drops down to the floor. Here picking the steak up appears to us as a drama of power relationships.In the end Ransom has to meet Liberty Valance in order to make the town a better place. He insecurely approaches Valance with his small gun but for the surprise of everyone, including Ransom, Valance loses and dies. This is obviously an act Ransom, who barely knows how to handle a gun, couldn't have won Valance. Tom, supposedly, comes to the restaurant too late and sees Hallie taking care of the wounded Ransom. Here Tom makes the biggest choice of his life he abandons the heroism as the killer of Liberty Valance because of a promising lawyer, and at the same gives up the love of his life, Hallie. He enters to the shadows of the street as the cowards of the new world are celebrating -- brilliant psychological depiction by John Ford. History is stripped down from all of its idealistic form to a personal loss. Next comes an extremely powerful and tragic scene where Tom goes and burns the house he was supposed to build for him and Hallie to live in; he gives up of his dream. Ransom is anguished he has resisted violence for all his life but now has a killing on his conscience. The two perspectives; the immortalized history and the truth are now revealed as Tom tells Ransom the truth that he actually killed Liberty, with a shotgun, from the shadows. Ransom is relieved and ready to continue his career as a senator-to-be. The truth is out, history can be re-written but it won't be. The real man who shot Liberty Valance can step into the shadows of history. In the end, when we return to present day from the flashback, Ransom who is now a senator explains quite clearly to the press that the true hero of the stabilization of civilization was Tom Doniphon. To which the reporter replies When the legend becomes fact, print the legend. The alcoholic journalist and the lazy sheriff represent the new world which isn't as glorious as it could be. Ford's brilliant cinematic sense is shown in here, and the picture of corrupted political power is grotesque as the election turns into a Chaplinian farce. The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is also about the sudden beauty and injustice of life. The cactus blossom is the motive of the film and it grows out to be a strong metaphor of the new world. It collects both symbolic and emotional significance to itself as the story goes by. The cactus blossom equals civilization and education. In the beginning Hallie hopes that one day their town will be full of them, and in the end when Hallie and Ransom are leaving the funeral by train they see a land, which was once cold and vacant, full of cactus blossoms, hopes and dreams.

She had to be constrained from opening the floodgates of what would no doubt become the WORST example of Illegal Alien Migration in the history of mankind! You know the law once they set foot on sovereign soil ... ... (can you imagine? - Kryptonians collecting welfare!) No, she definitely had to go back, unless ... ... the story became her loss of home, that just like in the comics, she was sent to Earth to escape Argo's gradual transformation into Kryptonite, and the whole city's terrible death from radiation poisoning.But David Odell, probably arrived at his story germ by asking what all audiences ask, Then what happened? Because straightaway you have problems with questions, like OK, what does she do when she gets to Earth? & OK, so there's the Omegahedron. What can Supergirl do with it once she's wrested it back from Selena? Ecch! I think there is only one major flaw in this movie and that is that the comic book Supergirl Mythos collided BADLY with David Odell's fresh new storyline someone said, You've gotta have all of THIS as well, and it was downhill from there.Having said that, I find Jerry Goldsmith's score, especially the March and the Love theme, inspired and very much in keeping with John Williams' tradition of great movie scores. The Monster theme seems familiar and clichéed, that descending diminished 5th (the gravelly bass Uh-Oh sound) strikes me as corny. John Williams proved in the Superman movies that shimmering high strings and woodwinds against gluggy percussion can send evil tingles up your spine and also be a (new) sound for evil and terror.I'd like to end on a positive note I'm glad to read the Faye Dunaway is proud of her contribution to Supergirl and that film as a whole. For her sake there's nothing worse than being criticized over your work and thinking glumly, I know. I agree.

Great film that perfectly fulfilled my expectations. The only advice I can give, is don't expect to be overwhelmed by the time the film ends. Though it gets pretty demented at times, its ways are strangely subtle. If you've liked Michael Haneke's Funny Games, then you should not hesitate to see this French film too.Michel and Clair are travelling by car to their remote summer house on the outskirts in Switzerland. Taking some time off to renovate things & spending a holiday with their little kids. Still in French, at a highway rest-stop, Michel encounters Harry, who claims to be an old schoolmate of him. Michel has no instant recollection of what all Harry has to say, but politely plays along, clearly avoiding any offense to Harry. And when Harry, accompanied by his sex doll wife Prune, kindly suggests to drive from France to Switzerland together, in separate cars, Michel agrees. His wife Clair, hesitantly reluctant at first, ultimately consents. The moral of this set-up? Trust your wife's female intuition. Michel just made a big mistake.From the moment Sergi López gets introduced as the friendly Harry (at the start of the film), director Dominik Moll manages to saddle you up with an uncomfortable feeling. And very slowly, it all becomes more and more unsettling as the film proceeds. The events & complications portrayed, make excellent use of the isolated setting that our family inhabits. The environment itself poses absolutely no threat and for once, it's also not the locals our outsider family should fear. The bad things will come from someone they've already invited into their comfort zone. And by the time they start realizing that, bad things are already getting worse.A big merit of this film, is undoubtedly the fact that Moll put real characters into realistic situations. And he does all this by not exaggerating or emphasizing details, but keeping things simple instead. While Harry, and subsequently his wife Prune also, provide all the necessary abnormality in this every-day plot, it's the characterization of the family that makes this film feel familiar and real. It's the little things, like kids getting annoying on the backseat of the car during a long summer drive. Or Michel's parents having the desire to meddle & help out with his undertakings, often more uncalled for than not so. Michel's mother making a subtle inquiry about his wife, indicating us she has her own thoughts on her son's marriage. These little details are irrelevant to the plot, but they make real humans out of the characters. And while you pick up on these subtleties, it enhances the awareness of the fact that Harry's abnormal behaviour is seeping into the lives of these very normal people. Even in scenes where Harry is not featured, you keep him in mind, because at most given moments he will always be in the company of another family member on another location. A splendid way to keep the viewer on his toes in a slow but steady moving film.Harry, Un Ami Qui Vous Veut Du Bien is by no means explicit, but it's still an effectively disturbing film. At times slightly comedic, due to Harry's impossible behaviour. Lòpez strikes the right note with his performance between overtly friendliness & plain craziness. At no point he goes shamelessly over the top, nor does the film really feature any excessive outbursts of hard on-screen violence, and that really works for the better. The mild brilliance of this film, lies with the question as to what Harry's motivation is and what the outcome of it all will be. Do not expect a big mystery to be revealed. Do not expect a puzzle from the past explained. Do not expect grotesque bloodshed and violence. Expect subtlety and finesse to great effect.

At no point he goes shamelessly over the top, nor does the film really feature any excessive outbursts of hard on-screen violence, and that really works for the better. The mild brilliance of this film, lies with the question as to what Harry's motivation is and what the outcome of it all will be. Do not expect a big mystery to be revealed. Do not expect a puzzle from the past explained. Do not expect grotesque bloodshed and violence. Expect subtlety and finesse to great effect. ","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Mystery"},{"date":"3 February 2010","score":"","review":" I finally watched it, been on my to-see list ever since it came out. Great film that perfectly fulfilled my expectations. The only advice I can give, is don't expect to be overwhelmed by the time the film ends. Though it gets pretty demented at times, its ways are strangely subtle. If you've liked Michael Haneke's Funny Games, then you should not hesitate to see this French film too.Michel and Clair are travelling by car to their remote summer house on the outskirts in Switzerland. Taking some time off to renovate things & spending a holiday with their little kids. Still in French, at a highway rest-stop, Michel encounters Harry, who claims to be an old schoolmate of him. Michel has no instant recollection of what all Harry has to say, but politely plays along, clearly avoiding any offense to Harry. And when Harry, accompanied by his sex doll wife Prune, kindly suggests to drive from France to Switzerland together, in separate cars, Michel agrees. His wife Clair, hesitantly reluctant at first, ultimately consents. The moral of this set-up? Trust your wife's female intuition. Michel just made a big mistake.From the moment Sergi López gets introduced as the friendly Harry (at the start of the film), director Dominik Moll manages to saddle you up with an uncomfortable feeling. And very slowly, it all becomes more and more unsettling as the film proceeds. The events & complications portrayed, make excellent use of the isolated setting that our family inhabits. The environment itself poses absolutely no threat and for once, it's also not the locals our outsider family should fear. The bad things will come from someone they've already invited into their comfort zone. And by the time they start realizing that, bad things are already getting worse.A big merit of this film, is undoubtedly the fact that Moll put real characters into realistic situations. And he does all this by not exaggerating or emphasizing details, but keeping things simple instead. While Harry, and subsequently his wife Prune also, provide all the necessary abnormality in this every-day plot, it's the characterization of the family that makes this film feel familiar and real. It's the little things, like kids getting annoying on the backseat of the car during a long summer drive. Or Michel's parents having the desire to meddle & help out with his undertakings, often more uncalled for than not so. Michel's mother making a subtle inquiry about his wife, indicating us she has her own thoughts on her son's marriage. These little details are irrelevant to the plot, but they make real humans out of the characters. And while you pick up on these subtleties, it enhances the awareness of the fact that Harry's abnormal behaviour is seeping into the lives of these very normal people. Even in scenes where Harry is not featured, you keep him in mind, because at most given moments he will always be in the company of another family member on another location.

If the bus's speed down 50, it explodes. The starring hops on board but the driver is wounded and a valiant passenger (Sandra Bullock) takes the wheel. Then the bus runs , bounds and flies.This mindless, interesting and ingenious film is packed with thrills, suspense, tension and lots of interminable action. Enjoyable relationship between two main characters, Reeves and Bullock, based on risked circumstances work out pretty well. Sandra Bullock steals the show as feisty passenger and Keanu Reeves is fine as brave, intrepid police. Witty argument that dispenses excitement as well as entertainment. Packs atmospheric cinematography using Steadicam or hand-held camera by Andrej Bartkowick. And stirring musical score fitting to action by Mark Mancina . The picture is stunningly and effectively realized in his firs-time as director by Jan De Bont, a successful cameraman (Basic Instict, Die Hard) and Paul Verhoveen's usual and occasionally director (Speed 2, Twister). It's followed by inferior sequel ¨Speed II¨ with similar technician and artistic crew , starred by Sandra Bullock, Jason Patrick, Temuera Morrison and Willem Dafoe. The film will appeal to Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock fans. Rating  Better than average, well worth seeing.
