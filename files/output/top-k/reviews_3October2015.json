The linearity of the narrative comes into question as we see Chaplin in the town, then up in the mountains, and back without an apparent transition from the two locations. Chaplin's films unlike Keaton's focus a lot more on his persona and characters around him. While Keaton engages with objects during gags, Chaplin engages with people, and both are equally engaging. Chaplin's tramp persona is always seen as the outcast, and with great composition shots, gains the sympathies of the audience. Examples of this is apparent in the mountain scene when he walks alongside the mountain and his lone figure is contrasted by this enormous mountain. There is also another great shot taken in the dance club where he first meets Georgia, here the camera is located behind Chaplin as he stands in the shadows looking at the dance floor. Both great shots that emphasize his loneliness and separateness from society. While I do enjoy this film, I must confess that Keaton's had me more engaged. Chaplin's gags are either subtle or extravagant and mostly emits from his tramp persona. The most remarkable 'gag' in this film is with the scene in the house, and to be honest, it got a bit repetitive after awhile. It was still enjoyable though.

Upon arriving to the town, it is clear something is wrong&#x97; everybody seems to have vanished, and the ones who do remain have died under inexplicable circumstances. Enter Ben Affleck and Liev Schreiber as a sheriff and his deputy who come to save the day, but things become more and more complicated after the arrival of an academic theories (Peter O'Toole).In the style of Miramax's late-'90s\/early 2000s horror films, Phantoms was directed by Joe Chappelle, who had previously directed the middling Halloween The Curse of Michael Myers in 1995. With Phantoms, Chappelle employs a similar visual style to his Halloween sequel, which includes flashy cinematography and editing techniques. Halloween The Curse... is one of the most despised films of its franchise, but I've always appreciated Chappelle's visual aesthetic which, while sometimes one dimensional, still has its own unique sensibility.Phantoms starts out phenomenally breathtaking overhead shots of the Rockies, moving toward a small community nestled in the mountains in the dead of winter. What the film does extremely well is create a pervasive apocalyptic feel that upholds its entire first act, and it is surprisingly riveting. Silent Hill and even films like Dawn of the Dead have shown us that there are few things eerier than empty streets that shouldn't be empty. An entire town, furthermore&#x97; especially one as isolated as it is in Phantoms&#x97; is even more quietly oppressive. The unease and intrigue is immediately established, and there are plenty of fun and chilling gimmicks as Going and McGowan wander through the Colorado wasteland.The film shifts gears about halfway in, and veers toward Predator territory with a philosophical and scientific bent to it, brought to us by none there than Peter O'Toole. While this shift is necessary for the film to run its intended course, it definitely creates a rift in the narrative that isn't as well-situated as it could have been. There are some fantastic moments in the last half of the film, but there is a sense that you are almost seeing two different movies.Joanna Going and a late '90s, post-Scream Rose McGowan play the ostensible lead characters, though there is a bit of confusion as to who constitutes protagonist in this film. Affleck and Schreiber are great, with Schreiber being especially abrasive and leery on the audience. O'Toole is fitting as the token Brit professor.Overall, Phantoms is very much enjoyable as raw entertainment; it has star power and is stylishly directed, and its first act is wildly atmospheric and nightmarish. Unfortunately, I do feel the film spins its wheels a bit too much as it delves into the second half, and sabotages the very tone that makes the first half so unnerving. No less, it is a fun film with enough memorable highlights to be worth a watch. 7\/10.

The coffin lid swings open to reveal a decomposed corpse clutching a box; at this point, Mel Brooks starts with his puerile comedy, a hand trying to snatch away the box, the corpse pulling it back. It's all downhill from here-on in, the dreadfully unsophisticated humour rarely hitting the mark.It's clear that Brooks has an affection for his subject matter, such is the attention to detail in the sets and the acute cinematography, but his gags simply do not do the concept justice, the material ranging from broad farce to puerile smut. To make matters worse, Brooks frequently has his performers break the fourth wall, giving knowing looks to the audience, which is plain embarrassing. While he was at it, he should have had some of his cast apologise to the viewers for their dreadful performances as well Gene Wilder is particularly irritating, shouting his way through every scene, Marty Feldman simply mugs a lot and rolls his huge eyes, and Madeline Kahn is annoyingly shrill.The film's most credible turn comes from Peter Boyle, as the creature, who is far better than the dross he is given to work with.

This is one movie considered one of the quintessential viewings of horror and is credited with revitalising the genre which had up to that point been in a way, dying out. As much as I respect Scream for doing that I can't write this and say I loved it or found it to be this amazing movie, I more felt it tries very hard to be smart but thinks it is smarter than it really is. The master behind the whole shebang is none other than Wes Craven who is considered one of the daddies of the horror movie genre and for good reason, the guy knows suspense when he see's it and crafts a movie that on his part is good and well done. I did however find little things about this that aren't all that great and the acting is not always that great even if this is supposed to be tongue-in-cheek.Our plot takes us to a town in the US and more specifically to a load of teenagers who are shocked to find out one of their classmates was brutally murdered by someone only we have seen wearing that now infamous mask. Our plot then takes us between murders as people are killed in the town, and not only teenagers are the target, this killer is one sadistic piece of work who also happens to be oddly funny too. Scream prides itself on making a mockery of horror and it's usually before this obvious plots, what it doesn't do though is truly branch out of that I mean if you watch closely it never truly changes the story, just plays out like any other. One thing I really did appreciate was the way Craven makes everyone a suspect and you really don't know who it is until the very end and even then you expect some kind of twist. I really wanted to love this I truly did but I do feel this has aged quite a bit, and I don't mean with its fashion etc. The reason I felt it is dated is because Scream itself created horror that could also contain humour as a light side gag, in turn Scream may have changed the game and had a few comments on the industry in horror but never truly stands out to me today and any movie which changes the game should be able to beat anyone who dares copy it. That all said Scream is still pretty damn scary I mean the killer jumping around is really quite chilling even if he keeps getting smacked by cupboard doors and kicked in the balls. As Horror goes it may not satisfy all those who prefer it serious but truly don't take this seriously and you'll have fun. I almost forgot to mention the actors involved; of course we have Neve Campbell as our main character of sorts Sidney Prescott who is in a spot of trouble throughout. Cast like Courteney Cox make it good but watching many episodes of Friends before hand makes me see her in a whole new light where she isn't Monica Geller. We then have David Arquette as a kind of comedy reliever in Deputy Dewey and some jokes also come from the future shaggy in Scooby-Doo (sorry I mean that is what I most remember him for) Matthew Lillard who alongside all the other cast members always has something funny albeit a little dark to say. I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to see Scream and call it a masterpiece or brilliant or even good for that matter but maybe one day though. I will though be able to recommend it and say it is OK and that I feel is good enough because this is one movie I think everyone should see whether horror fan or not you can't deny this is a popular movie and one you might just love yourself.

Okay, sure, the bloated running time belies a false sense of self-importance, and the script (which Joss Whedon will pay good money to help you forget he worked on) is still famously idiotic, pairing hackneyed dialogue with a cast of universally unlikeable characters.

Similarly, the film's slew of sea battles, a flurry of pyrotechnics and sea-doo acrobatics, are thrilling and a ton of fun. Throw in the cheerily nostalgic score by James Newton Howard, and we've wrapped the entire affair up in an adventure serial bow. Sit back, popcorn in hand, and enjoy.Naturally, fine-tuned acting is a low priority here &#x96; this is WATERWORLD, after all. Dennis Hopper, likely still nursing a hangover from Super Mario Bros The Movie, is really the only performer who owns up to the film's inherent campiness, and his snarling, teeth-gnashing yet strategically comedy deadpan villain is superbly entertaining. Yes, the irritating double- act of Jeanne Tripplehorn and Tina Majorino as the shoehorned in, perennially whining surrogate family unit do the film no favours (who can't swim in Waterworld, for crying out loud?!), but a brief appearance by the delightful Michael Jeter is enough to bring a smile to anyone's face, and 'spot the pre-fame Jack Black cameo' is always fun.

Khan is understandably angry at Kirk through this despite the context that he tried to take over the Enterprise and kill Kirk in... an earlier episode of the series maybe?

Would I be disappointed and see flaws that were not apparent to an overawed child? Well, that didn't happen. Instead, I was overawed all over again with the mastery of the whole thing.But of course, the film was more that just stunning visuals; there was also the story that was adapted from J. M.

Go ahead, walk away, you share our species fate; maybe you should have taken a greater interest? This allegory is an attack upon the sub-culture of disaffection that was so powerful in the greatest year of tumult in the US, 1968. Serling gives us plenty of hints that we are on earth The Forbidden Zone, early human weapons, Christianity converted into the Ape Lawgiver religion, subtle geographic hints with the surroundings after we emerge from the desolate Forbidden Zone. That area's barren landscape the director pairs with unearthly creepy dissonant music that, coupled with the Ape scarecrows, really tricks us into thinking they are on another world. Yes, the Ape masks are dated and it muffles their voices and enunciation but really, the rest of the movie is one of the most clever allegories ever written.

The hints above will make you, during your first showing, angry at yourself for not guessing where they are. Made during the height of the Cold War when millions of young people were walking away from their culture when you return this to its Zeitgeist, it will make sense to you. Taylor still holds his ontological estrangement, verbally, even when he sees our end. His emotion may betray his feeling of relation to us but he still re-establishes his existential alienation from us. Serling has him this way to teach us, through his anger, yet his alienation, that he shares our guilt. Also, still being estranged, why isn't he happy?

I always loved The Road Warrior to death this film stayed in my heart. Fury Road and The Road Warrior are Equal for me so I am ranting them 10 and I always tried to take the first film of the Max series as the best one in the franchise but I couldn't, because it is just too dark is not post apocalyptic film enough, it has Drama between the film and the plot starts slow which becomes really boring. The Road Warrior is the opposite of Mad Max which just stayed in my heart and I just love this movie to death and I always will. Mad Max 2 The Road Warrior still remains one of the most exhilarating action films to ever grace the screen. The car chases are as excitingly pulse-pounding as ever and no film has yet to surpass the final chase as the best in movie history. Yes, in terms of pure action, not many films have been able to equal The Road Warrior's thrills.Mel Gibson remains the only world-renowned actor in the whole film. He does a terrific job as the character Max, one of his best and most interesting characters. The development of Max is another intriguing component of The Road Warrior, and serves the film by giving it a human edge by featuring Max's slow transformation from loner to savior. Not only that, Gibson also creates a great action hero. There's not a moment in the film when we aren't rooting for Max to smash Humungus and his gang.The Humungus and Wez for me were the best villains ever in the film. Bruce Spence as the gyro-pilot is decent in his role and offers the film's few humorous moments. And also he has a lot of scenes and a lot of things to do in this film. Like flying that flayer helping Max saving him, fighting against Humungus thugs. Emil Minty as The Feral Kid is awesome. The old man as the narrator from the beginning of the film is The Feral Kid, I love the relationship between him and Max. That's what I love in this film the acting is TERRIFIC from the actors. Virginia Hey as Warrior Woman is beautiful and fantastic in this movie. I seriously loved how she acted towards Max that he isn't trust worthy, he needed to win her trust. I love Max's dog he was so better than in the first movie the other dog was. You could even see a personality in this dog. I love this movie to death and will always be in my heart Forever.

It doesn't attempt to add any fictional characters to the extent that this is possible or add steamy love scenes (2001's Pearl Harbor, I'm looking at you). The lesson here is never underestimate your enemy, and how easy that is to do when layers of bureaucracy are in the way, layers of bureaucracy that just can't believe that a nation of people that Americans then thought racially inferior would actually decimate Pearl Harbor to the degree that they did. Did you realize that in 1941 many Americans thought that Asians had poor eyesight because of the shapes of their eyes? I didn't learn that from the film, but it helps explain why so many prewar dramas were aimed at the Germans while the Japanese were practically ignored.Central to the plot is that U.S. Army Col. Bratton (E. G. Marshall) and U.S. Navy Lt. Commander Kramer (Wesley Addy) decipher the Japanese Purple Code and from the messages that they intercept, believe that attack is imminent. They pick the wrong week, but they have the right idea. As the warning goes up the chain of command so many things go wrong on the American side. Key generals or people reporting directly to the president are out riding horses or walking their dogs or doing what people do on weekends. Finally, Chief of Naval Operations Harold R. Stark (Edward Andrews) is notified and urged to call Hawaii, but no, he says he wishes to call the president first. He asks everyone to leave the room. After everyone leaves Stark is staring at the phone but it is not clear if he ever called anyone. Why??? Meanwhile, Admiral Kimmel (Martin Balsam) is quite afraid of attack in the months leading up to December 7, but his reaction is counterproductive. He orders all aircraft placed as close together as possible so they can be easily monitored for acts of espionage. That's fine, but it also makes it easy for the Japanese to destroy all of them with a few bombs.The morning of December 7th, two ordinary soldiers are ordered to be up bright and early to man the new Radar Center that is only operational from 4AM to 7AM. They spot the entire airborne Japanese contingency via their equipment, inform their superiors, but are told it is probably just a malfunction - go have breakfast! And on and on it goes. When the Japanese planes finally do appear over the top of the harbor everyone believes they are American planes until the bombs start dropping.I haven't mentioned much about the Japanese mistakes, but there were a couple of doozies. The first being that the Japanese - due to a slow typist - did not deliver their ultimatum to the Americans in Washington until AFTER the attack on Pearl Harbor began. The second mistake is mentioned in the final line of the film, delivered by General Yamamoto, whose idea it was to stage this attack in the first place. He mentions that many think that the Americans are soft, that they love only luxury, that they are not hard and war-like as the Japanese are but he mentions he fears We have only awakened a sleeping giant and filled him with a terrible resolve.Something never mentioned in the film that helps explain some of the inertia on the American side is the anti-war and isolationist sentiment that was prominent in America up to Pearl Harbor itself. WWI was looked back upon as a gigantic waste of time and lives, and America was just emerging from a decade long Depression. Perhaps if Harold Stark never made that phone call it was because he thought that the Japanese dropping a few harmless bombs on Hawaii might get Americans into the fighting frame of mind necessary to fight a two front war. I don't think from anything I've ever read that anybody right up to Roosevelt believed that the Harbor and its contents would be completely destroyed.If you've never seen it, please do. And realize it was meant to be as close to a documentary of what actually happened as possible. Highly recommended.

It doesn't attempt to add any fictional characters to the extent that this is possible or add steamy love scenes (2001's Pearl Harbor, I'm looking at you). The lesson here is never underestimate your enemy, and how easy that is to do when layers of bureaucracy are in the way, layers of bureaucracy that just can't believe that a nation of people that Americans then thought racially inferior would actually decimate Pearl Harbor to the degree that they did. Did you realize that in 1941 many Americans thought that Asians had poor eyesight because of the shapes of their eyes? I didn't learn that from the film, but it helps explain why so many prewar dramas were aimed at the Germans while the Japanese were practically ignored.Central to the plot is that U.S. Army Col. Bratton (E. G. Marshall) and U.S. Navy Lt. Commander Kramer (Wesley Addy) decipher the Japanese Purple Code and from the messages that they intercept, believe that attack is imminent. They pick the wrong week, but they have the right idea. As the warning goes up the chain of command so many things go wrong on the American side. Key generals or people reporting directly to the president are out riding horses or walking their dogs or doing what people do on weekends. Finally, Chief of Naval Operations Harold R. Stark (Edward Andrews) is notified and urged to call Hawaii, but no, he says he wishes to call the president first. He asks everyone to leave the room. After everyone leaves Stark is staring at the phone but it is not clear if he ever called anyone. Why??? Meanwhile, Admiral Kimmel (Martin Balsam) is quite afraid of attack in the months leading up to December 7, but his reaction is counterproductive. He orders all aircraft placed as close together as possible so they can be easily monitored for acts of espionage. That's fine, but it also makes it easy for the Japanese to destroy all of them with a few bombs.The morning of December 7th, two ordinary soldiers are ordered to be up bright and early to man the new Radar Center that is only operational from 4AM to 7AM. They spot the entire airborne Japanese contingency via their equipment, inform their superiors, but are told it is probably just a malfunction - go have breakfast! And on and on it goes. When the Japanese planes finally do appear over the top of the harbor everyone believes they are American planes until the bombs start dropping.I haven't mentioned much about the Japanese mistakes, but there were a couple of doozies. The first being that the Japanese - due to a slow typist - did not deliver their ultimatum to the Americans in Washington until AFTER the attack on Pearl Harbor began. The second mistake is mentioned in the final line of the film, delivered by General Yamamoto, whose idea it was to stage this attack in the first place.

Even if he only stands there and talk, you know you don't want him around in the neighborhood. The story itself is not scary, but the theme is dark.

Steve Martin plays a widowed doctor who specializes in brain surgery and all of a sudden becomes enamored of the gorgeous Kathleen Turner who has just managed in a hysterical opening sequence to knock off her wealthy older husband. Spoofing her role in Body Heat, Turner is deliciously evil, and seems to be have a wonderful time in playing this part. Martin, of course, does his usual stick, but mixing science fiction elements with a spoof of film noir which he had already done recently with Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid, he finds true love with a seemingly still living brain, voiced by none other than recent Oscar winner Sissy Spacek.A film clip of the 1953 science fiction film Donovan's Brain cast up his interest in experimenting, and features then first lady Nancy Davis Reagan in the archive clip. Verbal and visual sight gags a la Airplane! make this worth seeing over and over again.Among the visual highlights is Martin's checking out of a castle like house he wants to purchase, complete with laboratory and Turner's determination to get rid of anybody whom she can inherit money from. Her obvious plans of seducing the handsome Hispanic gardener is also very funny. Some surprise cameos along the way add to the hysterical moments that are frequent and sometimes pass by too fast to catch up on simply one viewing. Veteran director Carl Reiner practically outdoes himself in the delightful way he takes preposterous situations and makes them laugh out loud funny. I could not have seen this in the theater, because I think I would have been choking on my popcorn or spitting my soda at the unfortunate person in front of me. It is that funny. I won't spoil all the delightful things with your car by saying more, but being available on the Warner Brothers Archive Collection, this was more fun than I expected it to be, although I will give credit to the delightfully annoying voiced prostitutes who Martin encounters during his journey.

","genre":null},{"date":"3 October 2015","score":"","review":" A delicious black comedy along the lines of Death Becomes Her, this practically forgotten Steve Martin farce is now going on to my list of one of the best comedies of the 1980s, as well as one of the best comedies you've probably never heard of. Steve Martin plays a widowed doctor who specializes in brain surgery and all of a sudden becomes enamored of the gorgeous Kathleen Turner who has just managed in a hysterical opening sequence to knock off her wealthy older husband. Spoofing her role in Body Heat, Turner is deliciously evil, and seems to be have a wonderful time in playing this part. Martin, of course, does his usual stick, but mixing science fiction elements with a spoof of film noir which he had already done recently with Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid, he finds true love with a seemingly still living brain, voiced by none other than recent Oscar winner Sissy Spacek.A film clip of the 1953 science fiction film Donovan's Brain cast up his interest in experimenting, and features then first lady Nancy Davis Reagan in the archive clip. Verbal and visual sight gags a la Airplane! make this worth seeing over and over again.Among the visual highlights is Martin's checking out of a castle like house he wants to purchase, complete with laboratory and Turner's determination to get rid of anybody whom she can inherit money from. Her obvious plans of seducing the handsome Hispanic gardener is also very funny.

The general message is that you can be stupid and successful if you are white, dress well, speak well and slowly and are extremely composed. He is like a hollowed out perfect and fearless executive.Some people do see through this (certainly Eve and Dr Allenby) and he almost gets caught out \/ in trouble on several occasions. Its all highly unlikely and satirical but its sort of a mass hallucination rubber stamped by Benjamin Rand; he appreciates him for his honesty and others follow.Peter Sellars is amazing and its hard not to feel for him as he sets out on his own for the first time. He could easily have starved to death without the assistance of others.My guess is he has a type of autism. He is extremely calm and well spoken and his general cognitive ability is not consistent with someone illiterate.There are a few amazing scenes; one that grabbed me was when Mr Rand was using a dictaphone (which must have been rare in those days) to manage his stocks and assets. When he switched to a conversation about Chance, this input continued, with his words being echoed on the screen in a HAL like fashion.Shirley MacLaine is so seductive in this film; her behaviour is timeless. Her relationship with her husband is complicated and though loving, now appears open and non-sexual. I was touched by her relationship with Chance but it was not that persuasive.The whole support cast is wonderful from Benjamin Rand, his doctor to Jack Walden who played the President.My interpretation of the end of the film is not supernatural just a look at the world through Chance's eyes.
