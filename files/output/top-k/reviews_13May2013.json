It was the original in its mint condition, no extra Lucas digital crap. I remember that experience as if it was only yesterday. I remember falling in love with Star Wars. All the movies, all the games, all the toys, even. That was when I was about 5 and the dreaded Attack Of The Clones would grace the screen with its unholiness a year later.How in god's name do you do it? How do you review a movie that defined you? That you have loved for years? As a matter of fact, I re-watched this film just so I could have an unbiased opinion.The plot is that 2 droids on a ship are forced to leave through an escape pod and wind up on a dessert planet. They meet up with Luke Skywalker. They bring a message with the intent of reaching an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Luke knows a Ben Kenobi and believes they are somehow related. They make it to him and deliver the message. Obi-Wan then tries to teach Luke in the ways of The Force; a mystical energy that would give a Jedi (which are now extinct) his power. He meets up with Han Solo and Chewbacca and they try to rescue a captured princess from the grip of the evil leader of the empire, Darth Vader.I could write a 300 page book on how influential this movie was and STILL not have everything done however I personally hate it Oh this film was so influential so was Plan 9 From Outer Space! I hate it when people say that because it puts me off so I will not say a single thing in that respect.The acting is a mixed bag. James Earl Jones does a great voice as Darth Vader and David Prowse in that black suit of Vader with that combo Lucas made probably the most threatening movie villain to grace the screen. Alec Guiness does a good job as the mentor role and Harrison Ford does a good job as the scoundrel Han Solo. Those 3 are worth watching for alone. Mark Hamil and Carrie Fischer were pretty bad on their own right.There is something about family films of this time; Return To Oz, Labyrinth, Willy Wonka etc. where they were something to be experienced. The magic of those films are alive, even today, with this actually being a better example.Overall this is an enjoyable film. I even found it in me to tolerate the re-edits.

John Hammond sends a team, headed by Malcolm to the island to gather more information where they encounter another team out to capture the animals. What dangers await them in this 'lost world'?Review Steven Spielberg films, as I have learned, are meant to be lifelong experiences which curve out a permanent niche in the viewer's hearts. They take us on a journey of a life-time in a trivial period of 120 minutes. Although I am in no position to comment on Spielberg's filmography; having watched just two other masterpieces of the maestro Jurassic Park and Jaws. But those two films were exactly that- lifetime experiences! Sadly, 'The Lost World' hardly falls in that category.Sequels always have the burden of expectations (especially if the original is a near-perfect classic like Jurassic Park); but one expected better than this. Spielberg himself had requested Michael Crichton to write his literary sequel on which this film sequel is based. It seemed inexplicable as to why the mesmerizing Allan Grant, hero of the original, was replaced by Ian Malcolm who hardly featured in the second half. Crichton possibly felt it unjustified as Malcolm had a more heroic role in his novel and decided to give him his due here (by even miraculously reviving him after his supposed death in the book).The film starts off well promising more thrills at the prospect of only a few people in a dinosaur infested island; with no fences this time. But after a rather tiring build-up, when the team reaches the island they witness the arrival of another team out to capture dinosaurs. Riding on armed vehicles (including motor bikes) they trap the animals almost as a matter of joke. Hunting a jackal would probably be more difficult! The ridiculous ease with which the animals are captured dilutes the whole tension of the film. Even when the animals break-free; the sequence appears more funny than terrifying.Even in JP the real tension had begun post-intermission; but the first half was much more engrossing than here. There the debates, the character interactions and the whole arrangement hooked our attention without much sight of the 'main attractions'. Here we are exposed to a wide range of fauna; but yet the charm is missing with only the Hammond- Malcolm interaction standing out as a debate.Things improve in the second half but unlike just a handful of people in JP; the presence of a large human contingent prevents the generation of much fear (especially having seen their daredevilry earlier). But halfway into the second half, just when the excitement is at its peak, the survivors are whisked away in a helicopter; killing all the tension in an instant. Although more fun was yet to come (thank God!), it was in stark contrast to JP where the excitement had continued to rise culminating in a grand crescendo in the end.The plot has a lot of deviations from the novel, and probably in doing so developed a lot of glaring loopholes. The sequel raises questions about some developments from the first film itself besides having disputes of its own- 1) If the animals were bred in Site B; then why was the embryo storage located in Site A from where Dennis Nedry stole them? 2) Similarly, it was shown that the velociraptors were artificially hatched in the Site A lab. Was any exception made for not breeding raptors in Site B? Then how could the raptors come into existence there? 3) The lysine deficiency expectedly resulted in the death of all Site A animals. Yet why it didn't apply to Site B was one of the main questions for the team. But it remained unanswered throughout the film.

What dangers await them in this 'lost world'?Review Steven Spielberg films, as I have learned, are meant to be lifelong experiences which curve out a permanent niche in the viewer's hearts. They take us on a journey of a life-time in a trivial period of 120 minutes. Although I am in no position to comment on Spielberg's filmography; having watched just two other masterpieces of the maestro Jurassic Park and Jaws. But those two films were exactly that- lifetime experiences! Sadly, 'The Lost World' hardly falls in that category.Sequels always have the burden of expectations (especially if the original is a near-perfect classic like Jurassic Park); but one expected better than this. Spielberg himself had requested Michael Crichton to write his literary sequel on which this film sequel is based. It seemed inexplicable as to why the mesmerizing Allan Grant, hero of the original, was replaced by Ian Malcolm who hardly featured in the second half. Crichton possibly felt it unjustified as Malcolm had a more heroic role in his novel and decided to give him his due here (by even miraculously reviving him after his supposed death in the book).The film starts off well promising more thrills at the prospect of only a few people in a dinosaur infested island; with no fences this time. But after a rather tiring build-up, when the team reaches the island they witness the arrival of another team out to capture dinosaurs. Riding on armed vehicles (including motor bikes) they trap the animals almost as a matter of joke. Hunting a jackal would probably be more difficult! The ridiculous ease with which the animals are captured dilutes the whole tension of the film. Even when the animals break-free; the sequence appears more funny than terrifying.Even in JP the real tension had begun post-intermission; but the first half was much more engrossing than here. There the debates, the character interactions and the whole arrangement hooked our attention without much sight of the 'main attractions'. Here we are exposed to a wide range of fauna; but yet the charm is missing with only the Hammond- Malcolm interaction standing out as a debate.Things improve in the second half but unlike just a handful of people in JP; the presence of a large human contingent prevents the generation of much fear (especially having seen their daredevilry earlier). But halfway into the second half, just when the excitement is at its peak, the survivors are whisked away in a helicopter; killing all the tension in an instant. Although more fun was yet to come (thank God!), it was in stark contrast to JP where the excitement had continued to rise culminating in a grand crescendo in the end.The plot has a lot of deviations from the novel, and probably in doing so developed a lot of glaring loopholes. The sequel raises questions about some developments from the first film itself besides having disputes of its own- 1) If the animals were bred in Site B; then why was the embryo storage located in Site A from where Dennis Nedry stole them? 2) Similarly, it was shown that the velociraptors were artificially hatched in the Site A lab. Was any exception made for not breeding raptors in Site B? Then how could the raptors come into existence there? 3) The lysine deficiency expectedly resulted in the death of all Site A animals. Yet why it didn't apply to Site B was one of the main questions for the team. But it remained unanswered throughout the film.

Nearly 2 hours of my life is gone, thanks to Super Mario Bros., a movie that does everything wrong and nothing right. A serious contender for worst movie ever made, though I'll grant; it had quite a few unintentional laughs.In a ludicrous plot that seems to be trying to make sense of the nonsensical world of the video game it's based upon, Super Mario Bros. is about two plumbers named Mario and Luigi (we're supposed to believe they're brothers, but they look at least 20 years apart in age), who find themselves in a different dimension. The dimension is ruled by a man, or dinosaur, or whatever he is, named King Koopa. From there on, there's something about a meteorite, de-evolution, and a big glob of living fungus.I couldn't even begin to mention every single mistake this movie made. I can only go over a handful of flaws in this review, but trust me; I could go on for days.Let's start with the plot, which I've briefly explained above. It's stupid, it's strange, and jammed with clichés. Everything from henchmen that turn good, child being left on someone's doorstep, clumsy romance, etc.Much of the film feels like a live-action Saturday morning cartoon. In itself, that's not necessarily bad. In this case, believe me; it's bad. Gravity is defied, special effects are terrible, awful cinematography renders some parts of the film unwatchable at times. Need I say more?And yet, I haven't even scratched the surface. Characters are stupid and obvious things are overlooked. Tie-ins with the Mario games are forced and uncreative. Plot holes and continuity problems are everywhere. Does this film do anything right?While the characters' personalities are nothing like they are in the games, it's hard to blame the film for that. This film released in 1993, and at that point, none of the Mario characters had personality. Still, it should be noted that in the film, Luigi is the courageous one, and Mario is more cowardly (the opposite is true in the games). And speaking of Mario, his deep, harsh Brooklyn voice isn't at all the friendly voice we're used to hearing from the famous plumber, but once again, that's not really the film's fault, as no one had ever heard Mario speak before.The acting is relatively terrible. I'll just save time by saying all the performances are awful, with one exceptions. Bob Hoskins as Mario really isn't that bad. He makes the most out of what he's given to work with, and the result is a passable, painless performance.Alan Silverstri, what are you doing composing music for this film? You're better than this! It's depressing to see the composer of such classics like Back to the Future reduced to this. Still, the score is awful. The main theme is annoying, and there is no references from the original game's soundtrack in the score. There were lots of possibilities here, and Silverstri refuses to explore any of them.The dated soundtrack is a nightmare. Various pop songs of yesteryear are in this movie, and they all made me wince in pain. The exception here being Walk the Dinosaur. I laughed when I heard this playing, because this song is also featured in Ice Age 3, another dinosaur-oriented film starring John Leguizamo (who's terrible in this film, by the way).Unwatchable, flawed, and laughably bad at times, Super Mario Bros. is an abomination. Forgetting everything that makes the Mario games enjoyable, Super Mario Bros. is a mess of fantastic proportions. It's unusual to see a film this bad. It's almost interesting.

I'm not saying the Director Robert Gordon and others did a horrible job. I'm just saying besides the visuals in the film, there is nothing worth saying about the film. It was just another Sci-fi B-movie with a simple plot. It had a lot to say about what the nuclear tests and waste products of the day could do to living things. Like other Sci-Fi films at the time, without really looking into the science books, or watching old films that show that being expose to radiation or radioactive material would cause sickness or death. The movie has a make-believe field day by saying that Atom-Bomb cause things to get larger. Throughout the 1950's, you had a number of these types of clichés film. Example of objects in movies getting larger by being expose by radiation are ants, reptiles, and now octopuses! This film had an atomic size octopus from the deepest realms of the Pacific threatens the world's oceans wrecking and shipping anything that touches the water. Navy Captain Pete Mathews (Kenneth Tobey) and two expert marine-biologists, John Carter (Donald Curtis) and Lesley Joyce (Faith Domergue), work around the clock to find a way to stop the creature. The highlight of the film in my opinion, is where the creature create havoc on San Francisco Bay looking for some food supplies.

Anyways it's driven off, and found the Bay Area to being yummy! It wraps its tentacles around Golden Gate Bridge is amazing stop-moment action even if it's missing two. Ray trying to save money gave the Octopus only six tentacles than eight. I love the scene where the creature attacked the Ferry Building. It's kinda funny that cars are still passing by the Embarcadero while the creature was attacking. I think the movie makers forgot to cut the cars from that shot. There is a shot of the Octopus attacking the submarine that was pretty worthy that might pay tribute to Jules Verne or trying to rip his idea of a Giant Octopus attacking the submarine off. While I think it's pretty good, I have to say the Octopus that was attacking the Nautilus in Disney's 20000 Leagues under the Sea (1954) was better visual than this. Plus, this film didn't have Captain Nemo that would make the film, even better. Although this movie plot is little more than a rehash of earlier Atomic Age horrors movies like The Beast from 20,000 (1953), another Ray Harryhausen movie. The romantic sub plot is annoying to the point, it ruins the movie. There was a scene where they were testing the nuclear radiation. Three scientists are wearing protective suits while examining the specimen. Dr. Joyce stupidly removes her radiation suit, and Pete Matthews falls in love with her, rather than caring about her just being expose to radiation just then. Dr. Lesley is the worst scientist in the world. Rather than doing her job that could have save hundreds of Americans lives, she falls in love with a sea captain and spent more time with wooing him than solving this case. This story is presented as a documentary, as there is a narrator narrating pointless dilogue that isn't needed. Show, don't tell, movie. There are two versions of this film. One in color in newer DVDs while the older has it in black and white. In my opinion, I think it is best to leave the B&W movies in their original form. Overall the film pace is slow, is filled with stereotypes, and despairingly old fashioned. Still it's a lot of cheesy fun. Columbia booked this as a double bill with Creature with the Atom Brain all across the US. I wish it came with it. I would had love that. This is the film that brought together producer Charles H. Schneer and special effects legend Ray Harryhausen. Their professional relationship would last until Clash of the Titans, the final feature for both men.

It instead ran as a fairly standard documentary with little or no artsy shots, no ounce of strong propaganda is present anywhere in this film...This film is so well renowned partly because it is the only film to fully capture the massive spectacle of the Nuremberg Rally but it does not deserve its praise for cinematography or as a wonderful propaganda film as these attributes are not present.Before watching the film, I felt that Riefenstahl had gotten off lightly following the war when she looked to clearly be pro-Nazi having made this film and her Olympics ones but, unless her Olympics films show otherwise, she looks to be just a standard film maker who was lucky enough to get the opportunity to film one of history's most infamous gatherings.If someone else had been commissioned to make this film, the result could have been much better.

Many people hail this as the quintessential Generation X flick of the 1980's. What was John Hughes up to? He obviously had this penchant for blaming authority figures for teenage angst and problems in society. If that was his primary goal he definitely espoused it in all his other films as well. I think there were moments in this film that had sheer poignance when spotting the inner sadness in its characters. Several of the characters go through a sort of transformation and epiphany of how they see themselves in relation to others. The shame, the isolation and despair can be seen especially in Ally Sheedy's character.My biggest peeve about this movie is how it treats the characters and boxes them into these oversimplified stereotypes. If John Hughes wants to explore individualism and self-identity wouldn't he want to focus on how these stereotypes are often based on preconceived notions by others in that teenagers are more complex than he presents them? But the movie uses these stereotypes and wants to embroil them in a milieu to exploit discomfort as if this were one of those EST seminars for youngsters. Why can't a prom queen be a braniac as well as a popular social butterfly? Why can't a brainiac be a jock? Why can't a jock be a rebellious troublemaker? And why can't the oddball Goth-chick be a rebel as well? The movie intends to show very different characters in how they are all alike. But they aren't. In the beginning to the end they are still masked in their confined personas.I was also turned off by how the prom queen decided to make a pass toward the sullen Bender character after all that transpired between them. This was cinematic manipulation by making viewers believe that an insolent wild child can get the girl of any guy's dreams. What was even more disturbing is that he stated his intention to her that he wanted to be used to upset her uppity parents. It seems very out of character for her to suddenly just kiss him and offer him her diamond earring. Someothing tells me that this was a subtle way of displaying role reversals. The girl gives a guy a diamond earring instead of the reverse. The bender character, who is the strongest character doesn't change at all. He is still the hapless jerk he was from the beginning. I thought the most interesting character was the principal. Having worked in education I can understand his frustrations. He saw an institution he built his whole life's work around to crumble in a world of anarchy, disorder and uncertainty.What we see here is a generational gap between the older generation and the kids of Generation X and how much has changed in such a short period of time. Breakfast Club does have a message even though the scenes are contrived such as the corny dance nuances and silly pranks, but that's to be accepted in High School comedies.But the problems in public education today are far more egregious and worrisome than Breakfast club can even begin to convey.

To me, I thought it was OK. Nothing terrible or anything, but certainly not that good. Just an example of a mediocre sequel to a successful franchise.Let me start off with the positive assets, first. It does have some nice cinematography as is the beautiful scenery. The special effects are decent, score is good, Christopher Reeves did a fine job as the Man of Steel once again and the Junkyard scene is by far the best action sequence in a superhero franchise. There are also some comedic bits that got me a chuckle or two.Sadly, there are some flaws that ruined the entire movie for me. The storytelling is pretty lackluster, the direction from Richard Lester is disappointing (it's a shame since he did a fine job with his directing in the previous film), the story (aside from a decent subplot where Superman turns evil after getting affected by tobacco kryptonite), is thin and lacks the heart and charm that made the previous two so endearing, the script is awful, and aside from Christopher Reeves, the rest of the acting is a mixed bag. Margot Kidder isn't given much to do other than a cameo, Robert Vaugn's role as the villain is a poor replacement for Gene Hackman and using Richard Lester as the source of comedy doesn't work.Superman III, on it's own, is a mediocre entry to a successful franchise aside from the junkyard action sequence, which in my opinion makes it worth-watching. Besides, it isn't as terrible as Joel Schumacher's trite to the Batman franchise (I'm looking at you, Batman & Robin).
