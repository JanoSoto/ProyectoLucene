That is the extent of Independence Day's appeal, to see things blow up, and believe me, that can get old real fast.A lot of things about the movie have always bothered me, whether it's the unnecessarily lengthy countdown the aliens have toward destruction, as it gives ample time for city-dwellers to escape.

The action sequences deliver sporadic thrills, but they get repetitive very quickly, as it's mostly watching fighter jets and alien spacecrafts blow up.

In Geena Davis' first film in four years, you can see she's not giving it her all but she is good as the typical mother. Hugh Laurie is also good as Mr. Little and proves well in his first major role yet (I think). Michael J. Fox is very suites to the role of Stuart Little and is very likeable as the little rodent.

At times though, it does get a little too cute. Giving the theme of the film it's unlikely that `Stuart Little' will appeal to anyone over the age of 10 and\/or anyone with young children. This is actually quite a shame because there are missing out on a treat. While it lacks the adult humour and un-limitations of PG rated non-Disney films such as `Antz' and `Shrek', it amuses and entertains very well. While it has a lot of boundaries to keep in (given its G rating), some of the jokes are bound to make even the strictest of adults laugh.The cast work well together and seem suited to their roles. In Geena Davis' first film in four years, you can see she's not giving it her all but she is good as the typical mother. Hugh Laurie is also good as Mr. Little and proves well in his first major role yet (I think). Michael J. Fox is very suites to the role of Stuart Little and is very likeable as the little rodent. Most appealing though are the remaining voice cast who bounce off the screen. Nathan Lane, Steve Zahn, Chazz Palminteri and David Alan Grier are superbly cast as the stray cats and Bruno Kirby and Jennifer Tilly are great as Stuart's `other' parents. While many people criticise the film's concept, it isn't supposed to be taken seriously.

Not one you'd let babysit your kids, probably not even one who should be allowed to live among others, but a human being none the less.Having read the play (I never saw it on stage), and liked it, my main reason for watching this film was to see James Russo in the kind of role he was born to play.

Unfortunately for Will, that isn't possible.  Why?  Speaking as a man who's been through the pea patch a few times, it's because women make the rules.  There's no negotiation, appeasement, or qualification.  It's better to accept it without murmur.  But, valiant man that Will is, he tries his best to beat the odds, to be the only man in human history who has ever achieved both his freedom, and a steady supply of feminine relationships, simultaneously.  I must say, I admired his tenacity.  At one point of the movie, I thought he'd cracked the nut.  Completely by chance, he accepts a date with a single mom.  It's everything he ever hoped for  passionate sex, a regular ego massage, and an easy breakup.  Bingo!  He discovered the mother lode!But then, a number of chance occurrences intervene to totally change his fate &#150; the fate of being an island, which he chose for himself.  And just like real life, chance events show themselves as fate's very own calling card  everything that occurs of necessity, is expected, or is the product of a person's imagination, is powerless to reach our souls.  Chance is the Janus face of fate.  What I love about this movie is its absurdity  Chance in the absolute presents itself to Will in the guise of a twelve-year old boy.  And it's this wild incongruity that really gives this film it's pithy but warm sense of humor.  The compulsive fornicator becomes a surrogate father to a fatherless boy, remaining an island, but joining up with an archipelago.

I thought an actor can't have starred in exclusively bad movies in recent years, so I decided to give Richard Gere another chance. However I was so wrong. This movie is even worse! Right from the start the viewers have to endure 5 minutes of 50 chatterboxes screaming at the same time. Throughout the film it doesn't get any better, the chatterbox theme was so consistent in the film that my ears were totally overwhelmed (in a negatively way). There was no plot at all, no storyline.

Only Jud's wife seems to be missing from the movie, but you can't have everything that was in the book.  The story revolves around an old Indian burial ground that can apparently bring the dead back to life.  The book was written in 84 I think and there is actually an Italian movie called Zeder put out in 83 that is very similar in some areas to this.  I don't think King was inspired by it cause I doubt he could have seen it, but there are similarities.  One part from the book I wish they had left in the movie though is the path to the Indian burial grounds.  The creepiest part of the book is all the strange things they saw on their way from the pet cemetery to the burial ground.  In the movie it doesn't look as if there is a whole lot they have to go through to get there.  For the most part a rather somber movie that could use a few more scares...all in all though it is a pretty good King movie.
