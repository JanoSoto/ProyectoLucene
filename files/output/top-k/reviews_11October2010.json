It's an enjoyable and well crafted story that seems to run out of inspiration and falls back on a more conventional and contrived narrative.Captain John Boyd (Guy Pierce) is a U.S. Army hero of the Mexican-American War. There's a dark secret to his heroism, though, and that results in Boyd being exiled to the remote Fort Spencer in California's Sierra Nevada Mountains. He arrives in winter and joins the rag-tag, skeleton crew that keeps watch over the fort until the regular compliment of soldiers returns in the spring. Boyd's commanding officer, Colonel Hart (Jeffrey Jones), is a wearied intellectual. Private Toffler (Jeremy Davies) is extremely religious and somewhat touched in the head. Pvt. Cleaves (David Arquette) is the mid-19th century's version of a dope head. Pvt. Reich (Neal McDonough) is a seething wave of violence waiting to be unleashed. Major Knox (Stephen Spinella) is the stereotypically drunken Southern gentleman. Martha and George (Shelia Tousey and Joseph Running Fox) are taciturn Indian siblings and the fort's resident trackers and guides. This motley crew then sees a stranger named Colghoun (Robert Carlyle) stumble into Fort Spencer with word of a wagon train of settlers that ran into tragedy and cannibalism. Boyd, Hart, Reich, Toffler and George set out to see if they can rescue the survivors. Colghoun comes along to show them the way, but what he leads them to turns out to be worse than any of them imagined.Ravenous is a clever and intriguing film that aspires to add a new member to the monster movie genre. In this case, it would be an ancient Indian creature called the Wendigo. In the legend, when a man eats the flesh of another man in the wilderness, he gains his victim's strength and spirit but he only exacerbates the unholy hunger inside. Writer Ted Griffin and director Antonia Bird do a very fine job bringing that myth to disturbing life on screen. But after starting with something new and different, it's like these filmmakers lose interest in what they've created and Ravenous turns into something that would be familiar to anyone who's a fan of vampire movies. From shocking and unsettling, the story devolves to predictably suspenseful and unsurprisingly creepy. It's not bad, but it is like you're suddenly watching a different story.If you're not thrown off by that, there's a lot even those who aren't fans of horror movies can like about this film. Aside from a questionably ironic choice of music for one scene, Bird has a good eye as a director and a firm grasp on her storytelling. She and Griffen clearly but unobtrusively established who the characters are and then have those characters serve to advance the story in different ways. Guy Pierce doesn't show much more than that he's really good at brooding, but both Jeffrey Jones and Neal McDonough bring a genuine depth to their roles. Robert Carlyle's performance is a bit disjointed, but that's what his role calls for. And even as the story resorts to well-known vampiric tropes, it still manages to throw some honest surprises at you.There is a point where the film starts making some blatant political commentary on American expansionism and Manifest Destiny, but it's either too dated or too timid to have any resonance. And while criticism of America's desire to consume more and more fits the cannibalistic Wendigo, it makes less sense the more the story starts to be about vampires.Ravenous is a horror movie with a brain. It promises to be smarter than it actually turns out to be but given the pitifully low IQ of most of this genre, it's hard to hold that against it.

There have been hundreds, maybe a couple thousand, of sci-fi action movies where the basic premise of the story is at least as good as that. Yet, the overwhelming majority of those films suck really hard, while Robocop is one of the best action films of its era.In Robocop, a corporation called Omni Consumer Products is running the police force for the city of Detroit. The head of OCP (Michael O'Herlihy) wants to build a new development called Delta City in place of old Detroit, but first they need to find a way to control the raging crime wave that's crippling the city. The number 2 man at OCP is Dick Jones (Ronny Cox), but when his plan to patrol Detroit with robots fails spectacularly during a board meeting, ambitious young executive Bob Morton (Miguel Ferrer) seizes the moment to get The Old Man to approve his alternative Robocop program.That program involves moving likely candidates on the police force into high crime, high violence precincts and waiting for one of them to die. The cop who gets lucky is Murphy (Peter Weller) by being horrifically gunned down by the charismatic crime boss of Detroit, Clarence Boddiker (Kurtwood Smith), and his gang. Murphy's corpse is claimed by OCP and transformed into Robocop, who launches a one-cyborg war on crime and becomes a media sensation. But then Murphy discovers the secrets behind OCP and his transformation and, with his old partner Lewis (Nancy Allen), brings the real bad guys to graphically violent justice.This is a great movie. The acting is great. The writing is great. T he direction is great. The costumes are great. The special effects (aside from some stop-motion animation that looks a little dated) are great. Robocop is one of the films that helped make the 1980s the Golden Age of the action movie.One of the best things about the film is the way the story deals with the concept of the super-human or the super-hero. Murphy is transformed by tragedy into something more than human, but the triumph of the character isn't in using his inhuman power to battle the bad guys, it's in his struggle to reassert his humanity. I once read a review that called Robocop one of the greatest super-hero origin stories ever because it recognizes and emphasizes that the important thing about the super-hero isn't the power or the costume or the codename&#x85;it's the real person inside all that.Robocop also has some of the best cultural commentary you'll ever see in an action movie. The movie creates and explores a wonderful contrast between the immorality of crime and the amorality of big business and makes you consider who is worse &#x96; those who deliberately set out to hurt people or those who just don't care who gets hurt in the pursuit of their agenda.Robocop is also notable for creating one of the most interesting worlds in sci-fi movie history. The corporatized, soulless society of future Detroit, the glimpses we get of the chaos elsewhere on Earth and the crude degeneracy of its popular culture are still compellingly perverse, even after 20+ years of the real world racing to catch up.If you like action movies, you have to see Robocop. Even if you don't like action movies, you should still watch Robocop, because if you don't like this film you can be sure you'll never like any action movie ever.

The premise of this movie is that it is actually a marathon showing of back-to-back episodes of a reality TV show called The Contenders. Except this show isn't about boxers or Muy Thai fighters. In this show, 6 people are given guns and told the winner is the last one left alive. TV camera crews follow each Contender around as they kill each other off. The reigning champion in this 7th season of the show is Dawn (Brooke Smith), a very pregnant woman who has already killed her way through two previous seasons and 10 people. Now Dawn's been brought back to her hometown to square off against 5 final opponents; Connie (Marylouise Burke) - a nurse who takes to killing like a duck to water, Tony (Michael Kaycheck) - a drug addicted Guido who decides he doesn't want to play the game, Franklin (Richard Venture) - an old crank who has coated the inside of his mobile home with lead foil, Lindsay (Angelina Philips) - a teenager with the world's stupidest parents and Jeffrey (Glenn Fitzgerald) - Dawn's old boyfriend who is dying of cancer and is married, even though he's really gay. These 6 people fight and don't fight, kill and don't kill, all while a smarmy narrator teases the audience with their eventual fates. Clearly, Series 7 is meant as a black comedy take on the reality TV genre and it does a decent job of mimicking the conventions of the genre. There are confessional moments where the characters talk directly into the camera. The show is constantly building up to big moments and then cutting away from them to stretch the suspense out as long as possible. There are even a couple of good bits where they are obviously mocking the way reality TV show producers edit these shows together to manipulate the audience into thinking and feeling certain ways about the people in the show. But the basic problem of Series 7 is that it doesn't take itself seriously enough. Being too serious is usually bad for any movie, especially a black comedy, but this story needed to be thought out a lot more. That brings in the comic book fanboy. I am one, so I can speak from experience. We take our comics very seriously. Not only can we rattle off ridiculous bits of trivia, but we actually sit around and think about stuff like&#x85;who would win in a fight between Werewolf by Night and Vixen from the Justice League. We try and figure out how Iron Man's boot jets would work in real life. We try and explain why Modok doesn't kill Captain America when he has him tied up and at the big giant head's mercy. We don't just enjoy out comics, we enjoy coming up with our own explanations for how the things in comics could and would actually happen. Series 7, however, doesn't spend any time at all thinking about that stuff. It establishes that people are chosen by lottery to participate in The Contenders, but that's where the background information ends. I t's never explained who is running the show. It's never explained how a show like this exists. It's never explained what these people are playing for, other than their lives. I t's never even really explained how the game works. Imagine watching an episode of Survivor where no one ever explained to you that the players can win immunity by doing certain things. The way the contestants behave wouldn't make much sense, would it?Series 7 doesn't bother to think about how a murderous reality show would have to be set up. It just has these people being followed around by camera crews wearing bullet proof vests, but that doesn't make any sense. There'd be camera guys getting shot left and right, both deliberately and accidentally. A reality TV show about people killing each other would have to be different in certain ways than The Amazing Race or Big Brother, but this script never bothers to wonder about any of that. That lack of intelligence or care undermines the whole film. The actors all do a decent job, but the script puts them in situations and behave in ways that don't make any sense because the script never bothers to consider how a show like this would work in real life. Series 7 was made when reality TV was still a newish genre. Perhaps back then, you could more appreciate the satire because how a reality show worked was less certain and less well understood. Today, though, we know so much about what reality TV is and how it's made that it's hard not notice that Series 7 is rather lazily put together.

It just has these people being followed around by camera crews wearing bullet proof vests, but that doesn't make any sense. There'd be camera guys getting shot left and right, both deliberately and accidentally. A reality TV show about people killing each other would have to be different in certain ways than The Amazing Race or Big Brother, but this script never bothers to wonder about any of that. That lack of intelligence or care undermines the whole film. The actors all do a decent job, but the script puts them in situations and behave in ways that don't make any sense because the script never bothers to consider how a show like this would work in real life. Series 7 was made when reality TV was still a newish genre. Perhaps back then, you could more appreciate the satire because how a reality show worked was less certain and less well understood. Today, though, we know so much about what reality TV is and how it's made that it's hard not notice that Series 7 is rather lazily put together.

However, watching it again recently, I do realise how much this film conveys beauty and darkness into one, thus making it a really fascinating, if at times slow, ride.Essentially the plot is about Jennifer Lopez, who plays Catherine, a psychologist who is able to enter the minds of her patients through a new technology available, where she goes into the patient's mind and talks to them etc etc. She is asked to enter the mind of a serial killer in order to know where he has kept his latest victim who will soon drown. The only problem is that obviously entering a mind like that holds big risks, as she enters the unknown, and she may never get out....Jennifer Lopez gives a reasonably good performance and is definitely watchable. Essentially the plot is a lot like Silence of the Lambs, though you get to know more about the killer, who you often feel sorry for. This film sort of gives reasons for why someone can become crazy, and this film is more sympathetic to the killer.The visuals in this are fantastic and you can only marvel at the creativity. Though it does feel that this is sometimes more for show than heart, and I did feel that the scenes in the serial killer's mind did go a bit slow sometimes. I mean, Catherine is working on a clock and time basis - the victim doesn't have much time so I did think that she could have done it a bit faster, but then obviously she has to go easy and slowly with the killer or it will blow up so it was acceptable.This is essentially a Silence of the Lambs with added Science Fiction thrown in to make it seem more unique. The main problem with the film is that the characters aren't particularly interesting, despite the fact that they could have very well been. Vince Vaughn is also pretty bland in his role as the detective.This is more a thriller than horror, as some people might think it is horror, but I wouldn't recommend watching this at night for the first time since you won't know what is in store.

Most notably when it gets suspenseful and The Goblins-type music starts playing instead of something more typically suspenseful (classical music). Since the plot takes place in a theater, filled with actors who happen to be in costume, of course it is also bright and colorful and almost artsy just as Argento films tend to be. But moving on.The story's pretty simple. There is a serial killer locked inside a theater with a group of actors. They die off one by one (what else did you expect). Simple enough. But what makes this movie so GOOD? The characters are all, as they say, a character. Animosity exists among the actors but then the killer is out there and so they are a collective group of victims at the same time. They all meet their makers in different way, for the killer, (who creepily enough wears a mask from the play the actors are starring in), doesn't have an attachment to any one tool. He will use what he can when he can and you never know what it may be. The lead victim, Alicia, is easy to empathize with. She's on the quiet side but you don't want her to die and you know if someone gets the killer, it will have to be her. The gore is nice, as usual some realistic and some not, but all of it is somewhat classy.Here's something to think about. The play within the movie goes as so a man goes around raping and killing at night. He wears a mask. Later in the movie, for reasons I won't spoil, the director wants the killer in the play to be portrayed as the real life killer. Later in the movie (and this is all still early on), the real life killer puts on the original mask from the play and goes around killing like so. Now how's that for cool? You don't find weird stuff like this in every movie.The general 80's and Broadway-ish scenery for Stage Fright is pretty cool too. I was reluctant to watch this because what do I want to see a bunch of actors in some play get slaughtered for? I think Scream ruined that for all of us, right? Well I was wrong. This movie is excellent. It all comes together very nicely. It's good to watch in and of itself and it's got a good soundtrack.

Later in the movie (and this is all still early on), the real life killer puts on the original mask from the play and goes around killing like so. Now how's that for cool? You don't find weird stuff like this in every movie.The general 80's and Broadway-ish scenery for Stage Fright is pretty cool too. I was reluctant to watch this because what do I want to see a bunch of actors in some play get slaughtered for? I think Scream ruined that for all of us, right? Well I was wrong. This movie is excellent. It all comes together very nicely. It's good to watch in and of itself and it's got a good soundtrack. Plus the story itself, which while not the most intricate, helps make for an overall excellent movie.

They tell everyone it's to celebrate Philip's impending first public performance as a pianist. The truth is it's to celebrate their murder of another old school chum, David Kentley (Dick Hogan). The film opens with Brandon and Philip strangling David and stuffing his body in a trunk. They didn't kill him because they disliked him or because he owed them money. They did it for the thrill and as an experiment to prove they are the sort of superior intellects who can pull off the perfect murder. Philip is immediately disturbed by what they've done, while Brandon shrugs it off like it was nothing. To Brandon, the killing was just the first step. He's just as excited about the party. He's invited David's father and mother, David's girlfriend and her ex-boyfriend for some pleasant conversation and food served off the trunk where David's body is hid. He also invited Rupert (James Stewart), who was the prep school house master for Brandon, Philip and David. As the party unfolds, Brandon plays little games with his guests, Philip comes more and more apart at the seams and Rupert begins to suspect the terrible thing that has happened.While certainly suspenseful, Rope is first and fundamentally an attack on the sort of cynical, urbane sophistication that makes a mockery of good and bad, right and wrong, morality and decency. Brandon believes the superior man, such as himself, should have the right to murder if he chooses. It's a belief that had been cultivated in him by Rupert back in school, as Rupert is the sort of misanthropic intellectual who finds sport in everything that others find dear. There's even a discussion on the advantages of murder but while Rupert treats it humorously, Brandon is deathly serious. For Rupert is the sort of fellow who says outrageous things and thinks he believes them without ever appreciating what he's saying. Brandon, however, has no inner core of morality and ethics and such thoughts fill up the emptiness inside him.The acting in Rope is quite good. Stewart and Dall do excellent jobs playing two sides of the same coin. They create characters that seem so similar on the surface, yet the way they say the same things lets you detect the deep differences between them. And while his role is less complex, Farley Grainger does equally well as a man falling apart from guilt and fear. He's able to take Philip and make him seem just a little bit worse, a little bit more unhinged at each moment in the story until he finally snaps at the end. The other actors are given their own moments in the story's spotlight as well and they all manage to shine. Some of the dialog might sound a bit dated in the early 21st century, but it's still sharp and clever.Rope is also noteworthy as probably one of the greatest adaptations ever of a stage play into a movie. Hitchcock filmed the script as a series of long scenes shot with a single camera in one continuous take, essentially putting the audience on stage as the play is performed around them. He moves the camera throughout the apartment where the murder and party take place almost like it was another person, invisibly observing the goings on. Often, while the camera is focused on particular characters you can dimly hear the conversations of other party goers happening off screen.As wonderful a job as Hitchcock does though, it's hard not to think that a remake of Rope might be a good idea. The tools the great director had to work with in the late 40s are quite crude by today's standards. While the things Hitchcock does with the camera in Rope would have been cutting edge then, it's rather primitive compared to modern storytelling technology.Rope may be the finest expression of Hitchcock's visual skill as a filmmaker and is definitely a must-see for any fan.

They were generally not well acted or well written or well directed but there was something about them that a distinct minority of the audience would embrace and cherish. Maybe it was the basic idea of the story or a particular character or scene but there would be something that would catch the attention of a few while most viewers simply considered the film a piece of crap. That definition has changed in the last couple of decades. A cult movie is no longer a bad film that has a small but devoted audience. Cult now signifies a deliberate weirdness and a disinterest or refusal to be conventionally entertaining. No longer attempts at normal filmmaking that failed, cult movies today are never meant to or try to appeal to broad audiences. The whole goal is now to be as distinctively odd and incomprehensible as possible. While certainly not the first modern cult film, Repo Man is one of the first widely known and established some of the conventions of the modern cult genre. In a very generic sense, the movie is about the coming of age of Otto (Emilio Estevez) a young punk who tires of his life working days at a grocery store and nights slam dancing with his fellow losers. By chance, Otto falls in with Bud (Harry Dean Stanton), a repo man who brings Otto into the business and tries to teach him the repo code.

There's a lot of weird stuff in Repo Man. All the federal agents are blonde except for the lead agent who has a metal hand. Everything the characters eat or drink comes out of a generic package. A grimy mechanic dispenses zen wisdom and the repo men have an angry debate over whether or not John Wayne was a fag. If you take out the weirdness, this is a terrible movie. The story is haphazard and none of the actors except Harry Dean Stanton ever get much chance to emote, and he's basically stuck reciting lame theories about the way of the world to Otto. But with all the strangeness, I can definitely see the appeal. You'd certainly need to be the right age and the right attitude to be grabbed by the story eff the world outlook on the pointlessness and absurdity of life, but it also helps to be old enough to remember what the 1980s felt like to people who weren't in tune with Ronald Reagan's new America.

How did Rocky, a film that is so dull, feel good, old school, stereotypical, manipulative or mass audience appealing (as if that was negative) win over such intelligent masterpieces ? In other words, how could have Stallone beaten Scorsese? Well, maybe because you don't need a complex plot or a dark story conveying the eternal everything is crap message told in a monotone voice-over, to have a good movie&#x85; and Rocky is more than a good movie, it is what I would call a genuine masterpiece.Rocky features ordinary characters with everyday needs and goals in life and there's an authentic feeling in the movie that touches you deeply in the heart, why so? Because it's not about characters, it's about relationships, Rocky is a lovable dim-witted guy and his friend Paulie is definitely not the nicest guy in the world, but their friendship is so real, that their interaction transcends their flaws and we guys cannot not identify with them. Adrian is a shy, nerdy, and not very attractive girl, but she and Rocky formed one of the most romantic cinematic couples who ever shared the screen. Mickey is a grouchy old man but the father-and-son relationship that'll develop between him and Rocky is particularly touching. And last but not least, Apollo who started as an arrogant show- man, very patronizing with Rocky, ended up respecting him. The relationships in Rocky make the movie works emotionally with a believable sincerity. The story is driven by a very simple plot where characters progressively grow on you. We feel for them and we feel for Rocky who's the soul of the film.Rocky gives the average viewer a character to identify with -not an anti-hero à la Travis Bickle whose extreme acts might inspire some nut-cases, no- we have here an ordinary hero, a la George Bailey, who challenges his world in the ring. And that's what makes Rocky the greatest sports movie ever made. The movie defines Sport. Sport is the greatest medium 'little guys' can still use to express themselves, to defy the big guys. In sport, no races, no classes, strength is in the heart. Sport is the revenge of the poor, the misfit, the dumb, who sometimes prove that there's kind of wise nobility in the physical effort that all the intelligence of the world can not reach. It's about strength, it's about passion, it's about HEART, and Rocky has heart. And maybe that explains why it is one of the most eloquently criticized movies, as if Taxi Driver or Network ignited the disdain towards Rocky twisting the meaning of such beautiful words like honesty, dignity, and humility into its most cynical interpretation  naivety.But simply because Rocky doesn't fill your heart with anger and frustration doesn't make it a naive movie, it's easier to destroy and harder to build, and to build the determination and self-confidence of millions of people all over the world is an extraordinary achievement. And the inspiration comes from this vision of a man who goes through patience, pain and humiliations, and who gets hit so many times without falling that there is something very heroic in the ugliness of his face, as if it was carrying the mark of the nastiness of a world which won't give you what you want if you don't come to fight for it. Yes, Rocky is about fighting, fighting the adversity for which the iconic steps represent the most powerful allegory, fighting your own demons, fighting your weaknesses, not fighting with bravery, but fighting despite the fear, fighting at the risk of losing everything except your most precious asset  dignity and winning nothing except your most precious conquest  respect.And before you call Rocky cliché or naive, don't forget it's also a movie about a guy named Stallone, who was like a 'Rocky' in show business who wanted to make a movie about a guy who couldn't never have his break, and finally got the chance of his life, the chance to prove he wasn't a bum &#x85; Sly wanted to make this film, and (Yo Adrian!) he did it, and in a few months it was the highest grossing movie of the year, and grabbed the Best Picture Oscar. It's one of the most famous and fascinating box-office success stories, and more than that, it's an inspiration for all the average guys to believe in themselves and to go the distance. Rocky was a million-to-one shot, so was Rocky.

And that's what makes Rocky the greatest sports movie ever made. The movie defines Sport. Sport is the greatest medium 'little guys' can still use to express themselves, to defy the big guys. In sport, no races, no classes, strength is in the heart. Sport is the revenge of the poor, the misfit, the dumb, who sometimes prove that there's kind of wise nobility in the physical effort that all the intelligence of the world can not reach. It's about strength, it's about passion, it's about HEART, and Rocky has heart. And maybe that explains why it is one of the most eloquently criticized movies, as if Taxi Driver or Network ignited the disdain towards Rocky twisting the meaning of such beautiful words like honesty, dignity, and humility into its most cynical interpretation  naivety.But simply because Rocky doesn't fill your heart with anger and frustration doesn't make it a naive movie, it's easier to destroy and harder to build, and to build the determination and self-confidence of millions of people all over the world is an extraordinary achievement. And the inspiration comes from this vision of a man who goes through patience, pain and humiliations, and who gets hit so many times without falling that there is something very heroic in the ugliness of his face, as if it was carrying the mark of the nastiness of a world which won't give you what you want if you don't come to fight for it. Yes, Rocky is about fighting, fighting the adversity for which the iconic steps represent the most powerful allegory, fighting your own demons, fighting your weaknesses, not fighting with bravery, but fighting despite the fear, fighting at the risk of losing everything except your most precious asset  dignity and winning nothing except your most precious conquest  respect.And before you call Rocky cliché or naive, don't forget it's also a movie about a guy named Stallone, who was like a 'Rocky' in show business who wanted to make a movie about a guy who couldn't never have his break, and finally got the chance of his life, the chance to prove he wasn't a bum &#x85; Sly wanted to make this film, and (Yo Adrian!) he did it, and in a few months it was the highest grossing movie of the year, and grabbed the Best Picture Oscar. It's one of the most famous and fascinating box-office success stories, and more than that, it's an inspiration for all the average guys to believe in themselves and to go the distance. Rocky was a million-to-one shot, so was Rocky. ","genre":"Drama, Sport"},{"date":"11 October 2010","score":"","review":" Every time I visit Taxi Driver, Network or All The President's Men's boards, I find people whining about Rocky winning the Best Picture Oscar in 1977. How did Rocky, a film that is so dull, feel good, old school, stereotypical, manipulative or mass audience appealing (as if that was negative) win over such intelligent masterpieces ? In other words, how could have Stallone beaten Scorsese? Well, maybe because you don't need a complex plot or a dark story conveying the eternal everything is crap message told in a monotone voice-over, to have a good movie&#x85; and Rocky is more than a good movie, it is what I would call a genuine masterpiece.Rocky features ordinary characters with everyday needs and goals in life and there's an authentic feeling in the movie that touches you deeply in the heart, why so? Because it's not about characters, it's about relationships, Rocky is a lovable dim-witted guy and his friend Paulie is definitely not the nicest guy in the world, but their friendship is so real, that their interaction transcends their flaws and we guys cannot not identify with them. Adrian is a shy, nerdy, and not very attractive girl, but she and Rocky formed one of the most romantic cinematic couples who ever shared the screen. Mickey is a grouchy old man but the father-and-son relationship that'll develop between him and Rocky is particularly touching. And last but not least, Apollo who started as an arrogant show- man, very patronizing with Rocky, ended up respecting him. The relationships in Rocky make the movie works emotionally with a believable sincerity. The story is driven by a very simple plot where characters progressively grow on you.

Duke would never have taken on this gig however as director Eastwood portrays a west more wasted than wild, with all the main characters exhibiting at different times weakness and cowardice, often covered by that sort of macho toughness only usually seen in, well, John Wayne movies. How the principals face up to their fears defines the impact of the movie.Eastwood himself is a retired gunslinger gone to seed, bringing up his two young kids alone, now his younger wife has died, sought out by young cry-wolf aspirant Jamiz Woolvett's The Schofield Kid, to join him on the trail of two bandits, let off lightly by omnipotent local sheriff Little Billy, (played with relish by Gene Hackman) after they ruthlessly cut a local prostitute for impugning their manhood. The prostitutes themselves send out word that they'll pay a $100 reward for the wanted men, which initially attracts Richard Harris's unusual character English Bob (why not Irish Bob?), who's promptly sent packing in a scene set up to showcase Hackman's brutality and the size of the task ahead. Initially reluctant to follow, Eastwood, despite demonstrating how out of condition he is at both riding and shooting, can't resist the lure of the money and\/or the nobility of the cause and pausing briefly to recruit his old-time friend, a miscast Morgan Freeman en-route, it's not long before they meet up with Hackman and the prostitutes and the action really starts.Guilty as ever of dialogue and camera - movements as slow and deliberate as his own drawl, Eastwood eases us into the film, defining each character carefully and clearly, setting up the premise and providing a satisfying climax, when, inspired by Hackman's barbaric slaying of Freeman, who himself conquers under pain of death the cowardice that forced him to abandon the initial quest, he returns alone to the fray where the old reflexes kick in and his Willie character delivers the goods and rights the wrongs of the evil-doers.I haven't seen every Eastwood western from his younger days, but even I got the nods to the Man With No Name character, who Willie Munny might just be, 40 years down the line. This time though, Eastwood de-mythologises the genre's trademark heroism and bravery as it's only under severe provocation that he overcomes his demons and gives Hackman his just desserts. There's a few (only a few mind), humorous touches - Hackman's attempts at carpentry and Eastwood turning down a free-one from the prostitutes, but in the main it's bleak, gripping stuff.As I indicated above, I'm not sure Harris' presence added much to the film, while Freeman seems to be there just because he's Clint's real-life mate, but then I suppose Wayne wasn't short of favourites either. The cinematography is superb, however, all dark and autumnal, a fitting backdrop to the lives of the characters depicted here chasing the light into their old age, the background music is likewise muted and understated. Eastwood was later to debunk his other great screen persona - the vigilante cop, in the equally worthy Gran Torino and you have to admire the integrity and daring of the elderly director there as here, big enough and brave enough, in his twilight years, to underscore the very clichés on which he initially made his own name.

Oh how it still burns in my head. This poor film suffers from some odd sort of cinematic schizophrenia sometimes it thinks it wants to be animal house as it's stereotypical frat-boy-cum-slave-driver uses unidentified and nameless students as croquet posts and tunnels, and sometimes it wants to be a sentimental love story. This movie feels like a string of barely related pranks and humor that was patch-worked together with something akin to a plot. Our hero, the amiable and misguided but otherwise kind hearted Van Wilder is every college boys wet dream of a self-image Intelligent but not too intelligent, clever with comebacks, interested in finer things like love and friends and disinterested in having a life revolving around work, living off his fathers bank account, campus celebrity, blah blah blah.... I'm sure you've probably seen this before and it was much better as a high school movie called Fast Times at Ridgemont High, or was it Animal House, or maybe this film just tries to lamely take concepts from these better films and update them for a newer audience. Whatever it is it's pure crap.I've never seen such sick humor outside of a Troma Studios movie. At least with a Troma release you expect lots of feces, vomit, sick humor involving children and a plot as absurd as the premise. But in Van Wilder you get all the vomit, sperm and abuse with a plot they think you might care about. Boy has it good, boy gets told by father that he will not receive more easy money, boy has roaring good time as he crunches many business opportunities to raise money so he can continue with his chosen looserly lifestyle, boy meets overtly-cute pseudo-intelligent girl who wants an interview for the school paper, and wait for the surprise... Boy falls in love with girl who has boyfriend in the snottiest frat on campus. Bet you didn't see that coming. Bet you don't see the friction, pranks and insults that go on between Frat boy and Van Wilder. But then again, I am sure you do.The shining moments of the movie are only so because they will stay burned in your brain for days afterwards. Take for instance the continual shots of Van's bulldog's obviously fake, over-sized testicles which will fill your screen on occasion. You will get endlessly entertained by swaying testicles, floating hot-tub testicles, Van kissing dog testicles in an early morning surprise. As if the large testicles weren't enough we get one of the most disturbing scenes in movie history when Van plots revenge against his rival, the boyfriend of the main love interest of course, by removing the cream filling of eclairs using gynecological instruments only to be refilled by having his friend masturbate the dog to create a new and exciting filling. But wait! There's more! Once the many eclairs are full and the dogs testicles are now down to a normal, smaller pair, they are placed casually and suspiciously outside the snotty frat-house. Oh the horror as for quite a while we are treated to many frat boys voraciously enjoying every gooey, warm, drippy, clear drop of the dog sperm from the eclair as they make obvious comments like Wow, they're still warm and I think I have had these before. Trust me, much time is dedicated to this scene and.... Damn. I used to love eclairs.There is a lot of really easy and simple humor in this movie. Let's have an Indian student talk about dirty sex as it will be funny just for that accent. Or maybe we can get elementary school kids drunk and have them projectile vomit. Let's have strippers who fart smoke, that's cool.?? This movie has none of the charm of Beavis and Butthead, none of the stylistic unapologetic crassness of a Troma Film, And the plot is soooooo predictable and merely a rehash of almost every bad college film in history. It's the same plot as One Crazy Summer but not even close to funny and that film used Curtis Armstrong in a way that we all laughed at. In this film he has been degraded to a momentary laugh and no character at all. No body in this film gets fleshed out, the only thing remote to character development is the exchange student gets laid and Van Wilder comes to understand why he hasn't left college in 7 years and trust me that part is about as deep as a dog-bowl.I wish I had something nice to say about this movie. Even Showgirls is enjoyable for it's embarrassing attempt at seriousness, but this piece of work has no redeeming qualities. The only truly funny moment is as the credits roll and we see some of the behind the scenes pranks with several characters playing up homosexual elements that were only hinted at in the film.

He's a two-bit crook and his chickens are finally coming home to roost, that is, he will be sent to prison. However, his young lawyer secures him a week to get his affairs in order. This includes saying goodbye to his ten year old son, Joey, ditto to his ex-wife, Ev (Joan Cusack) and getting his boss to write a letter of recommendation for him before sentencing. However, one night, chaos reigns. Bernie is supposed to take his son to the movies but, in a severe thunderstorm, a plane goes down right in front of Mr. LaPlante. The door to the aircraft is blocked and a fire has started. Unbelievably, Bernie gets the door open and rescues the passengers, including hotshot reporter Gale (Geena Davis). After doing this heroic act, however, LaPante quietly heads over to his son's house. Its way too late, as Eve informs him, and she sends him packing. On the way home, further trouble arrives when his car breaks down and he must hitch a ride from homeless vet John Bubber (Andy Garcia). It is there that Bernie tells John about his courageous act, with John duly impressed. As Bernie has only one shoe from the ordeal, he leaves it with Bubber for a one-legged man of John's acquaintance. Ho, ho! Soon the press and Gale, especially, is looking for the hero and they offer a reward of a MILLION BUCKS to help entice him into the limelight. However, Bernie has set up another crooked meeting and gets whisked off to jail. Its John, instead, who comes forward, for he has the Cinderfeller shoe that matches the one the press has found. Now, everyone believes Bubber is the hero, and in all sincerity, his former past as a hero of Vietnam is revealed, along with other charitable acts. But, once Bernie is sprung on bail one last time, will he spoil the story by giving the press the real scoop about which one of them is the true hero? This is a terrific movie that belongs on a list of 100 best films. It is intelligent, humorous, and very relevant. The cast, too, is superlative, with Hoffman giving one of his best performances ever as the grumpy, law-bending Bernie. Davis, Garcia, Cusack, an uncredited Chevy Chase and all of the others are great, too. The direction of Stephen Frears is also topnotch while the script, sets, costumes, and camera work are fantastic as well. In short, this one is a genuine keeper for the ages. Be a hero or heroine to someone who has never seen it and arrange a showing soon.

This includes saying goodbye to his ten year old son, Joey, ditto to his ex-wife, Ev (Joan Cusack) and getting his boss to write a letter of recommendation for him before sentencing. However, one night, chaos reigns. Bernie is supposed to take his son to the movies but, in a severe thunderstorm, a plane goes down right in front of Mr. LaPlante. The door to the aircraft is blocked and a fire has started. Unbelievably, Bernie gets the door open and rescues the passengers, including hotshot reporter Gale (Geena Davis). After doing this heroic act, however, LaPante quietly heads over to his son's house. Its way too late, as Eve informs him, and she sends him packing. On the way home, further trouble arrives when his car breaks down and he must hitch a ride from homeless vet John Bubber (Andy Garcia). It is there that Bernie tells John about his courageous act, with John duly impressed. As Bernie has only one shoe from the ordeal, he leaves it with Bubber for a one-legged man of John's acquaintance. Ho, ho! Soon the press and Gale, especially, is looking for the hero and they offer a reward of a MILLION BUCKS to help entice him into the limelight. However, Bernie has set up another crooked meeting and gets whisked off to jail. Its John, instead, who comes forward, for he has the Cinderfeller shoe that matches the one the press has found. Now, everyone believes Bubber is the hero, and in all sincerity, his former past as a hero of Vietnam is revealed, along with other charitable acts. But, once Bernie is sprung on bail one last time, will he spoil the story by giving the press the real scoop about which one of them is the true hero? This is a terrific movie that belongs on a list of 100 best films. It is intelligent, humorous, and very relevant. The cast, too, is superlative, with Hoffman giving one of his best performances ever as the grumpy, law-bending Bernie. Davis, Garcia, Cusack, an uncredited Chevy Chase and all of the others are great, too. The direction of Stephen Frears is also topnotch while the script, sets, costumes, and camera work are fantastic as well. In short, this one is a genuine keeper for the ages. Be a hero or heroine to someone who has never seen it and arrange a showing soon.

Universal's modernization takes liberties with the original's premise and goes for broke. We begin by upping the violent action, and teaming Bruce Willis with Richard Gere; as it turns out, this counts for a lot. Adding Sidney Poitier doesn't hurt, either. The film features polished production values, and is capably corralled by director Michael Caton-Jones. While satisfying viewing, The Jackal is not quite believable, and all too mechanical.As the film's official synopsis outlines, A ruthless assassin (Willis) has been hired to eliminate someone at the very top of the U.S. government. Constantly changing his identity and location, he is known only as the 'Jackal'. Everything about this hit man, including his sinister timetable, is a secret.Aware of the Jackal's presence, but uncertain of his purpose, the FBI's Deputy Director (Poitier) faces the biggest challenge of his career. In order to track down this cold-blooded killer, he and a by-the-book Russian intelligence officer (Diane Venora) enlist the aid of an imprisoned Irish terrorist (Gere). These unlikely allies enter a global race against the clock to stop the mysterious mercenary before he can complete his deadly assignment. The climax is okay, but the film's most memorable - and blood-splattering - sequence is definitely Mr. Willis' testing of his assassination equipment, with an annoyingly over-talkative Jack Black (as Ian Lamont) proving to be a sweet target. Although he's not the best role-model around, it's interesting to note that Willis' character is most likely homosexual; it would have been very easy for filmmakers to give him a feminine interest, but they don't. As the film's leading lady is Ms. Venora unconventional, and we develop a romantic interest in her gradually, as does Mr. Gere.****** The Jackal (11\/14\/97) Michael Caton-Jones ~ Bruce Willis, Richard Gere, Sidney Poitier, Diane Venora ","genre":null},{"date":"11 October 2010","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" The Day of the Jackal (1973) was a solid suspense thriller, cleverly scripted by Kenneth Ross from Frederick Forsyth's intriguing best-seller.

Whether it be more of the horrific, or just the suspense that terrorizes people in the meantime, a good horror movie needs THAT. Wishmaster going clothes shopping while the saleslady flirts with him? That's not horror. Alexandra getting killer migraines every time the Wishmaster makes a wish real? Yawn. It just doesn't work. It's comical in all it's failure to deliver. It's so BASIC.

Bond, and specifically Connery's Bond, is a serious officer of Britain's military intelligence, division six. But now he's just an actor going through the motions of showing his face for a camp extravaganza. And one wonders what all the humor was for anyway. I mean, why was it put in there to begin with?Did some young producer with money say We're taking Bond in a new direction...? I mean, for all of some of the bad lines or borderline camp moments in the previous films, they did come across as high moments of drama and peril. The fun was in the notion that Bond's character knew all too well that his outcome was favored, and savored the victory with various emotional tones (situation depending).Somehow this seemed to be lost on the production team for Diamonds. How and why they missed this one can only speculate. But, for whatever reason, the formula that made the previous Bond films successful was completely abandoned. As if the new threat was nothing to be taken seriously, because the previous films were silly (or so the production team and director probably thought). As a result we get this foolish and very weak installment of the world's most famous secret agent, who is reduced to a middle aged smile.Where's the Bond with a purpose from the previous films? Why on Earth even make this film? Answer; to salvage a franchise until such time as another replacement Bond can be discovered.It's one of the great cinematic screw ups in history. It ranks up there with the Salkinds' trashing of the Superman property or their creative financing with the musketeer films. Diamonds is just series of half heartedly acted scenes strewn together to tell a threadbare story with threadbare acting.I'm just truly at a loss of how to explain this film. I mean, Dr. No had its moments of silliness, but you could suspend your disbelief and note the silliness for being serious moments of espionage drama.

Stop sleep walking with a smirk!, a better plot, better action sequences, and a sense of import to the film at large.Otherwise the score is fine, the opening song is good, the lensing is so-so.

The Sheltering Sky is not quite up there with it, it seduces the senses with visual grandeur, rather than emotional significance. Set in North Africa shortly after WW2, not too distant in time frame from his masterpiece, it is not so much an epic without a plot or a love story as some have suggested, it's more a parable, but it needed deeper motivational elements for its' central characters to compel.The majestic dunes of the Sahara, stark beauty of a barren landscape, is beautifully captured, as is the slim sensuality of Debra Winger; she doesn't seem to mind too much about the sand and flies getting everywhere - in one scene, a fly surreptitiously wanders along her thigh and up her dress during love-making with her husband in the desert - an unpaid extra, who nevertheless, contributes to the realism. In my neck of the woods, flies always demand rehearsal fees.What is it with Italian directors and sex in the desert? Think Antonioni's Zabriskie Point, an artistic orgy, mind - not a fly in sight! Believe me, there are plenty here - not just up Ms Winger's dress, but buzzing around buses, in hair, on faces, attacking raw meat on sale in markets, everywhere.John Malkovitch, as the husband, doesn't provide any reason for his professorial ambiguity - married to a beautiful woman, trying to reignite their relationship, but as soon as the opportunity arises, exploring North African prostitution with a wholly non academic interest. And the character of George Tunner, their part-time fellow-American travelling companion, captivated and at the mercy of Debra's charms, seems unaware or unconcerned by at least one of the Ten Commandments - quite a big thing in those days - why, Cecil B. DeMille even made a film about them.I like meaningful films, I liked this one, in spite of - or maybe because of - it's significance being at best eclectic, and perhaps confused. When any movie character does anything, you have to ask why. Here, you shrug your shoulders and wistfully wonder, why not? Luscious landscapes are more for painters. The images here needed more cohesion and purpose behind them. But they are images to enhance your spirituality, eventually providing a warm glow, even in an ultimately dismal context.

Believe me, there are plenty here - not just up Ms Winger's dress, but buzzing around buses, in hair, on faces, attacking raw meat on sale in markets, everywhere.John Malkovitch, as the husband, doesn't provide any reason for his professorial ambiguity - married to a beautiful woman, trying to reignite their relationship, but as soon as the opportunity arises, exploring North African prostitution with a wholly non academic interest. And the character of George Tunner, their part-time fellow-American travelling companion, captivated and at the mercy of Debra's charms, seems unaware or unconcerned by at least one of the Ten Commandments - quite a big thing in those days - why, Cecil B. DeMille even made a film about them.I like meaningful films, I liked this one, in spite of - or maybe because of - it's significance being at best eclectic, and perhaps confused. When any movie character does anything, you have to ask why. Here, you shrug your shoulders and wistfully wonder, why not? Luscious landscapes are more for painters. The images here needed more cohesion and purpose behind them. But they are images to enhance your spirituality, eventually providing a warm glow, even in an ultimately dismal context.

The Sheltering Sky is not quite up there with it, it seduces the senses with visual grandeur, rather than emotional significance.

That story follows Michael Sullivan's journey during the Great Depression of protecting his son after being betrayed by the people he had trusted, during his time of being a hit man.Michael wears the reticent treatment for his family and fellows, until he finally lets the demeanour slip somewhat when he tries to connect to his son. A beautiful but short sequence which shows some of the humanity of a person who has lost so much, by simply asking his son what his favourite lesson is.If the film could have done this longer or even more frequently it could have gotten Hanks an Oscar nominations for his inexperienced yet sympathetically drawn attempts, to try make his relationship with his son partially normal. Partially normal because of his appetite for killing his way up the food chain till he gets to the man responsible, all out of revenge; not to mention his added complication of Jude Law constantly intercepting his footsteps.Its not that's its hard to understand the inconceivable drive a person must have when they have sustained the losses of family members but to have some go as far as to compare it to The Godfather when the films vaguely match the same par is slightly unrealistic.It scarcely touches American Beauty's impressive shadow, never mind what is considered the greatest gangster film ever made. All that put on the self for a moment though, it remains a firmly impressive offspring from Mendes even if his debut was, and will always be, his best, not that him and Hanks (not to mention the other superb cast members) lack a struggle to maintain an air of freshness in a genre so ridden with clichés.
