One of the sons, after a stint in jail, has a change of heart and decides to save his little brother from the mindless hatred that nearly ruined his life.This film tries so hard to be a gritty, dark, morality tale of modern western life that it ends up parodying itself unintentionally.  I'm afraid a few angst ridden actors smoking and shouting out a lot of swear words does not a great movie make.The movie also has two of the stupidest moments on film.  Why the brothers, one of whom has just escaped death at the hands of his former gang, decide to sit and have a nice chat about life rather than run to the nearest phonebox and warn mom and sis (who are sitting passively at home like women do) is unrealistic.  Perhaps it didn't cross the boys minds.   Dumber still is why any self-respecting, skinhead gang did NOT immediately go to the boy's home and kill and destroy is beyond comprehension.  But perhaps it didn't cross their collective minds.The second stupidest moment on film ever is this film's ending.Do yourself a favour and see Romper Stomper if you want a truer reflection of the evils of skinhead violence.

This is when the plot goes somewhat&#133;hazy. Yes, it's not as good as the original (but could it ever be?). Yes, the songs aren't as good as before (ditto). And yes, the storyline seems somewhat random (They've got to get to the battle of the bands. Why? Ummm&#133;) But this film seems somehow able to redeem itself. Dan Akroyd plays a much-changed Elwood, who whilst not as funny without John Belushi to work with, is still charming in his own way. A surprisingly adept John Goodman plays Mighty Mac, singing well in those dulcet tones. Joe Morton plays Cab's protégé (although he doesn't know it) and works well with what he's given, script-wise. J. Evan Bonifant proved to be the greatest surprise of the piece. Whilst bordering on the insufferable cute-dom of so many Hollywood kids, he manages to pull himself up to a hilarious performance (check out the dancing & harmonica playing).A star-studded cast (to those who recognise them) helps fill out the film, and fans of the original will enjoy recognising familiar faces & places. The songs, whilst not having the same toe-tapping qualities of the original are all entertaining enough, as are the lower quality car chases.I know most people will hate this film it meanders, it repeats the original and has the most unsatisfying ending of just about any film I've seen, and yet the characters, music, dance and comedy all make this a film worth seeing.Long live the Blues.

It also would have worked better as more of a two-hander between Om Puri and Linda Bassett's characters, rather than needlessly beefing up the roles of the children (none of whom was actually established as a believable character anyway, with the exception of the youngest son Sajid).There was simply too much tokenism and stereotyping - gay son runs away from arranged marriage; white neighbour hates 'Pakis'; son's girlfriend has 'comedy' overweight friend - to allow the film to be taken seriously. Try watching it again, though, or just thinking about it again, not in terms of race -  because it's not actually a film about race. It's about family, masculinity, values, tradition, morals - almost everything BUT race.

I had heard of a new man on the scene that apparently was the talk of Hollywood.  I had also heard that there were some pretty interesting actors in the film and I had heard that Harvey Keitel was the one responsible for getting the film started.  So I was intrigued to see what the fuss was over this film.  However, the first time I saw it I was rather impartial to it.  It's not that I didn't like it but I just thought it to be okay.  I didn't really get what all the fuss was about but I did have a hard time watching the torture scene.  So I put Reservoir Dogs away in my mind until Pulp Fiction came out.  Because by the time Pulp Fiction came out Tarantino had penned the story for a brilliant True Romance and for Natural Born Killers and he had a few hysterical cameos in films like Sleep With Me where he attacked famous films like Top Gun and what they really meant.After I was swept away with Pulp Fiction, I went back and watched Reservoir Dogs again and this time I saw something that I didn't or couldn't see before.  I can't really put my finger on what it is or why it is that I didn't see it's brilliance before but I just didn't.  But Reservoir Dogs has to be one of the best movies ever by a new comer.  Forget how it is directed because it's direction is fine, but what Reservoir Dogs has that is sheer brilliance is an ear for dialogue.  There is not one character in this film that doesn't have at least one insightful thing to say.  Even Tarantino gives himself some great dialogue with his take on Madonna's Like A Virgin, or his displeasure with his given name by Joe ( Mr. Brown sounds too much like Mr. Shit!).There are certain films that perhaps should be mandatory viewing at film school, Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs should be two of them.  This is one of those films that if perhaps you didn't quite like or understand the first time around, you should see again.  It hits you like an epiphany the second time.  In Tarantino's world, people are never one dimensional.  They have things to say whether it is about tipping or the name of an actress, or the rants of Nice Guy Eddie talking about them having places all over of the place.  I would love to see Kevin Smith and Quentin Tarantino get together and write a film.  It would probably be the funniest yet most serious film that has ever been made and it would certainly be one of the most entertaining.Reservoir Dogs is a film that you can watch over and over again and never get tired of and you can always catch something that you never caught the last time.  This is truly one of the finest films ever made and if you haven't seen it in quite some time, do yourself a favour and rent it.

Why can't we have more movies like that instead of the dumb big-budget event movies we're usually fed every summer?Sure it had heaps of historical inaccuracies, but if I wanted a history lesson, I'd stayed home and watched some obscure documentary on ABC channel. This is pure entertainment, a heavily stylized vision of the ancient Rome, so what if it takes a few liberties with the written history (which itself cannot be really viewed as a true reflection of the distant past)? Real Spartacus has died in the battle, but do I hear anyone complaining about that great crucifixion scene at the end of Spartacus the movie? No sir.The story of Gladiator is simple, unoriginal but well told. Since when there was a truly original story, anyway? If you think about it, all the stories recorded in the course of human history revolve around the same old topics love, loss, revenge, etc. It's how these stories are told that matters, and Gladiator succeds on that front. Apart from a few awkward moments, I enjoyed the dialogue it wasn't brilliant, but at least it was mercifully free of the long pompous speeches given by the heroes of the old Roman epics.Russell Crowe as Maximus... wow, what a man. He's not some plastic, generic underwear model he's a real beast who projects sheer, undistilled masculinity not seen since the times of Clarke Gable. His Maximus would kick Charlton Heston's Ben-Hur's ass any time, and, unlike Mr. Heston, he never ever felt wooden or over-acting to me. He puts so much conviction and commitment into his character that you *believe* him to be the hero any man would follow and die for; when he says stuff like strength and honor (which would probably sound pompous and embarrassing if mouthed by a less talented actor), it feels hundred percent sincere. Too often I see the so-called historical movies brought down because you can never get rid of the impression that all you see is just a fancy celebrity dress-up party. Not in Gladiator, not with Crowe his performance is absolutely un-selfconscious and real.The rest of the cast is fantastic, especially Phoenix, who succeeds in creating a character who you just plain hate (although I felt kind of pity for him, too). I've read some negative comments about the choppiness of the battle scenes; personally, I had no problem following the action, this technique worked just fine for me, perfectly conveying the sheer chaos and fury of the combat. That rain of fiery arrows in the beginning was simply an unforgettable imagery. Initially, I felt slightly led down by the ending, especially after that vague promise of the Roman army entering the capital. After I've done some thinking, though, I've realised that the movie couldn't have ended any differently. And to those who complain about the improbability of the whole thing movie villains have *always* underestimated the heroes. It's an honoured tradition, people. Also, the emperor would have definitely finished Maximus off were it not for some unexpected treachery from the third party.Finally, I loved the cinematography and the score, and never ever looked at my watch during the whole engrossing 2 1\/2 hours.

Like all great movies, it has unfortunately become prone to backlash and criticism. I think that almost all of it is unfair; the movie is brilliant, and it is not supposed to be a `typical' war film.  Instead of talking about the film itself, I actually feel compelled to defend this masterpiece.First of all, what people bash more than anything are its `bookends' in the military cemetery.  Every war movie has its own theme-`Full Metal Jacket' was about men dehumanized into killers, `Gallipoli' was about soldiers as individuals, and SPR is about the sacrifices that WWII veterans made that we no longer appreciate.  The `bookends' would not have worked in `The Thin Red Line,' or `Apocalypse Now,' but they are necessary here.  True, they are a little overly sappy, and the Ryan family's girls are so attractive it is distracting.  But one of the major points of this movie is that many of us have forgotten what the veterans of this war did for us, and that we no longer appreciate the sacrifices they made.  Far too often do younger people look at those from the war generation with indifference and disrespect.  I am a WWII buff, and ever since I started reading about it in high school, I was always bothered by the fact that nobody seemed to care about it.  The faded flags that open and close the movie are not symbols of patriotism-they are our fading appreciation for WWII veterans' sacrifices.  I am happy that SPR brought a renewed interest in this subject.SPR is about the American GI's experiences in WWII Europe, and Spielberg is not claiming with this film that people of other nations did not help or die fighting fascism with us.  The Second World War almost covered the entire globe.  I would never complain about the lack of Americans in `Soldier of Orange,' or `Hope and Glory,' two great films that are about the Dutch and British experiences, respectively.SPR is not as black and white as many people claim it is.  The Germans are not all `EVIL MONSTERS' in this movie; Isn't it Americans who sadistically shoot Germans (actually Czechs) who are most obviously surrendering?  The `Steamboat Willie' Character is just a soldier doing his job--he later comes back and shoots Americans, after Miller's squad released him (and NO, he is NOT the SS Trooper that stabs Mellish with a bayonet!)  Miller made the mistake of letting `Steamboat Willie' go, because it seemed the `decent thing to do.'  But was it?  A POW who is let go cannot be expected to surrender--what do we expect him to do?  Tell his army upon meeting them that he can no longer shoot at Americans? According to the Video Hound book on war movies, the SS Trooper who stabs Mellish tells him, in German, `Don't fight it.  Soon this will be over.  You're going to a better place.'  He is mercifully killing his enemy. He also lets Col. Upham live, since Upham poses no threat to him.  This soldier is a good soldier, unfortunately on the opposite side.  To many, it may seem like the Germans are depicted as monsters in this movie.  But we must look deeper, and remember that men under fire don't really care what nice guys their enemies are outside of war.  And comments like, `The German army were not Nazis.  They were just soldiers' are as much generalizations as saying `all Germans were Nazis.'  There were plenty of Nazis in the Wehrmacht.  As far as I know, SPR was well received in Germany.  Spielberg was honored with an award there shortly afterward.This movie is anything but unrealistic.  I think I even saw a claim on the IMDB that it was fake because `Soldiers would never storm Normandy without air and artillery support.'  Guess what?  They did!  Normandy was an awful mess!  Heavy cloud cover and fear of killing their own soldiers prevented the US from defeating the defenses at Omaha, and lead to the ultra-realistic slaughter depicted in the first half-hour of the movie.Some have called the actions of the Germans in the final sequence (one of the greatest I have ever seen), `unrealistic,' and `unintelligent.'  At this point in the war, the German army was in no position to carry out proper by-the-book battle tactics.  They were under Hitler's stubborn orders to `hold at all costs' and were sent on many suicidal missions like this one.  It was so bad that by the time of the Battle of the Bulge, Americans were appalled at the way that German soldiers marched right up a road, in broad daylight to the front.  Historian Steven Ambrose said that Americans had no choice but to open fire on the columns, and mow them down like a scythe cutting wheat! Besides, Generals, Captains, Lieutenants, and Privates, etc. on both sides make horrible mistakes, and this war was no exception. As for the plot of this movie, one historian described it as `Very possible, but not very probable.'  Take the case of Fritz Niland of the 501st PIR.  All three of his brothers were killed in combat, in different divisions.  Luckily, high officials in the US army knew where he was, and they had him sent home, immediately.I don't see how anyone could not be affected by the opening sequence on Omaha Beach.  It is clearly amazing.  Actual veterans have offered their medals and patches to Spielberg because of it.  The climactic battle sequence is absolutely unforgettable.  I've seen it so many times, yet it is still difficult to watch.  It is incredibly suspenseful, frustrating, explosive, horrifying, and shocking, yet it is all beautifully and coherently filmed.  When Miller tells Ryan to `earn this,' he is also speaking to us, to the generations born after WWII, who have to respect what the veterans have done.Most of us haven't `been there,' and we will never be able to say that we know what combat is like.

The killer demands to know the whereabouts of Sidney Prescott from his hapless phone victim, Cotton Weary. So now we have to wait not only for the endless round of stalk-and-chase scenes on the perky heroin, but for the killer to actually find her in the first place.The post-title trawl around the various locations of the original characters gradually brings them all together. In order to continue the tension the script once again has split Dewey and Weathers and attempts to surprise greatly by re-uniting them again at the end. Meanwhile no-one whatsoever is interested in the Campbell's character, who once again plays a supporting role to the many cameos, in-jokes and new characters.Scream 3 has absolutely no focus and is a remarkably cold experience. The characters in Scream were always stronger than those of its successor but this time even the few remaining ones have been underwritten and acted with little enthusiasm from the cast (a similar flaw can be found in Marquand's Return of the Jedi). Arquette is stiff and uninteresting, Cox-Arquette nervy and thoroughly stereotyped (some may remember how impressively her characterisation just avoided obvious cliché two films ago) and Campbell simply awaiting the pay cheque. New characters provide little interest since they are predominantly actors playing Scream characters in film-within-film horror-movie, Stab 3.So the dearth of human interest thoroughly unengaged (bar an amusing and rather touching cameo from Jamie Kennedy as film buff Randy) whose personality only serves to reminds us of how inferior the series has become, one inevitably looks to the suspense elements for a modicum of real interest.Unfortunately, the identity of the killer is an area that the cynical minds behind this concoction might have paid greater attention to, but alas it has scarcely been more obvious. It would take an extremely deficient mind not to guess at once who he\/she is from the early set-pieces. This is made even more obvious by the sheer obviousness of its red herrings. The chase sequences are executed with requisite gusto and style by Craven, even playing games with our memory of the sets in the original film (which have of course been reproduced in proportion-perfect detail in the Hollywood back-lots), but can not disguise the fact that they are tense but never once frightening.The hopeless (and frankly, incoherent) finale takes far too long to reveal what we have already guessed at anyway, and revels in sadism and brutality towards women even more than usual, whilst singularly failing to deliver anything new in its closing seconds. For all its smug mocking of genre clichés, it is remarkable how many there are that these films would rather you didn't notice they are adhering to. Logic, of course, has become irrelevant by now and once again the killer keeps on trying to kill the protagonist before using his final chance to stop and explain all the motives.Most galling of all is the defence of the film's existence in terms of its trilogy status. Scream 2 hinted at it with a throw-away remark, but part 3 never misses an opportunity to remind as us that we are watching part 3 of 3, even though the killer never actually states an intention to finish a trilogy. All concerned (characters and film-makers) seem intent on following the rules and guides set out by Randy in his video monologue. The three-act structure adds nothing to the drama or our understanding of the previous films, except to relentlessly point out that some detail from the past which we have overlooked may come back to get us in the last reel (it never does by the way, it just contrives new back-stories which were evidently not there first time around).If Craven, Williamson et al had never made another Scream film, who exactly would be crying out for precisely two more? Scream would be recognised for what it really  is (and the more of these films that get made, the more the original film is undermined), a witty and energetic horror spoof that conquered the hardest (and generally, most pointless) genre of all, the horror-comedy, and succeeded in both. There was nothing exceptional in the idea, but it was executed with startling technical proficiency and a real affection for the spirit of the films it lampooned. The characters may have been thinly drawn and two-dimensional but they were at least engaging to watch for the running time. And crucially, Sidney's slightly dour self-pity was nicely offset by her spunk-filled friend Tatum (the lovely Rose MacGowan). In 2 and 3 there had been no foil for Sidney and she is simply the dull centre of a lifeless universe.The swipes and references to horror films were never over-emphasised, but a believable part of the film's world; the closet small-town community that might well have been drip-fed scary movies set in towns like theirs. The move towards more commercially viable (and populated) locales in the subsequent films has lessened their impact considerably and left a fundamental flaw in their ideology the main point that 2 and 3 have kept making is that under the cloak of celebrity and fame, the plight of the individuals who suffered is forgotten. People make money out of other peoples' misery and take the benefits that come with it. Problem is, the sequel makers care just as little about human beings and are content to simply sit back and wallow in the sound of cash-tills pinging the world over.

Scream 2 hinted at it with a throw-away remark, but part 3 never misses an opportunity to remind as us that we are watching part 3 of 3, even though the killer never actually states an intention to finish a trilogy. All concerned (characters and film-makers) seem intent on following the rules and guides set out by Randy in his video monologue. The three-act structure adds nothing to the drama or our understanding of the previous films, except to relentlessly point out that some detail from the past which we have overlooked may come back to get us in the last reel (it never does by the way, it just contrives new back-stories which were evidently not there first time around).If Craven, Williamson et al had never made another Scream film, who exactly would be crying out for precisely two more? Scream would be recognised for what it really  is (and the more of these films that get made, the more the original film is undermined), a witty and energetic horror spoof that conquered the hardest (and generally, most pointless) genre of all, the horror-comedy, and succeeded in both. There was nothing exceptional in the idea, but it was executed with startling technical proficiency and a real affection for the spirit of the films it lampooned. The characters may have been thinly drawn and two-dimensional but they were at least engaging to watch for the running time. And crucially, Sidney's slightly dour self-pity was nicely offset by her spunk-filled friend Tatum (the lovely Rose MacGowan). In 2 and 3 there had been no foil for Sidney and she is simply the dull centre of a lifeless universe.The swipes and references to horror films were never over-emphasised, but a believable part of the film's world; the closet small-town community that might well have been drip-fed scary movies set in towns like theirs. The move towards more commercially viable (and populated) locales in the subsequent films has lessened their impact considerably and left a fundamental flaw in their ideology the main point that 2 and 3 have kept making is that under the cloak of celebrity and fame, the plight of the individuals who suffered is forgotten. People make money out of other peoples' misery and take the benefits that come with it. Problem is, the sequel makers care just as little about human beings and are content to simply sit back and wallow in the sound of cash-tills pinging the world over.

Story deals with naval intelligence Costner being hired by Secartary of State Hackman to act as a liaison for the Pentagon. Problem is both men are having an affair with drop dead sexy Sean Young, but niether man knows who her other lover is. In a jealous rage Hackman kills Young. To try and cover up the murder, Hackman starts a phony story about a Russian spy, orders an investigation into Young's death, and seals up all the entrances in the Pentagon. As time runs out, all the cules start to point to Costner. Will he be able to escape and prove his innocence. Riveting, sexy, and sylish. All the performances are terrific. The two stand-outs however are, Patton as Hackman's crazed assitant, and Young in what has to be the performance of career. This film will have you at the edge of your seat from start to finish and will blow you away with its shocking ending (that has to be one of the best plot twist of all time and most important it is believable.)

Even if you are not very familiar with Shakespeare's plays or have always been confounded by his verse, one can still appreciate this film for the tremendously inventive ways by which Almereyda has interpreted the core scenes of Hamlet in the context of corporate America. His visually striking translation of scenes like Ophelia's drowning and Hamlet's famous `to be or not to be' soliloquy are a delight and true brain candy. The cast is all around superb, with the classically delivered lines from actors Liev Schreiber (Laertes) and Sam Shepard (Ghost) nicely counterbalancing the very contemporary style of delivery from Ethan Hawk (Hamlet), Bill Murray (Polonius), and Julia Stiles (Ophelia).There will no doubt be much comparison between this film and Baz Luhrmann's flashy modern remake of Romeo and Juliet. However, whereas Luhrmann's film ultimately fails in going beyond the boundaries of its visually striking presentation, Almereyda's Hamlet proves to be far more than a mere spectacle for the senses. In fact, this is the serious flaw that plagues most of the films coming from young, talented independent filmmakers these days all style, no substance. Well, this Hamlet has both. By setting the film deep in the heart of a very real and very modern steel and concrete American jungle like New York City, which is infused with the relics of the mass media and cold capitalistic consumerism, Almereyda powerfully enhances for the audience the sense of the desolation of his characters that results from urban isolation. This is a theme that Hong Kong director Wong Kar-Wai has so masterfully examined with his films Fallen Angels and Chungking Express. In Hamlet, we get a powerful dose of both Kar-Wai's visual flair and the sensitive, crumbling heart that it sheathes.

If you like and appreciate psychological drama and suspense, then, by all means, see it.House of Games tells the story of an esteemed psychologist and writer, Dr. Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse), who tries to help a patient and gets involved in the shadowy world of con men led by the charismatic Mike (Joe Mantegna).  To say anything more about the plot would ruin the suspense.  Frankly, I find it hard to believe anyone who says they saw the twists coming.  Just like a clever con artist, this movie draws you into its web and lulls your vigilance.The story is taut and well-crafted, the dialogue smart and laconic, the acting uniformly good (Mantegna is superbly charismatic).  Some have complained that Dr. Ford is not a very sympathetic character, and wondered why Mamet would make Lindsay Crouse look so physically unattractive.  But Dr. Ford is supposed to be cold and aloof; moreover, her homeliness is in a way essential to the plot (at one point, I believe that an injury to her sexual self-esteem is a key part of her motivation ... I'll say no more).House of Games is a dark look at the underside of human nature that concludes on a note of discomforting ambiguity.
