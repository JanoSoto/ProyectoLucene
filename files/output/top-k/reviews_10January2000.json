The people who were the harshest most probably had not viewed I'm From Hollywood or A Comedy Salute To Andy Kaufman before watching Man On The Moon. Andy was best known as the adorable Latka on Taxi, but his other characters were focused on much more. This film made many people uncomfortable because you're not supposed to laugh at some obnoxious person named Tony Clifton degrading and spilling beer on his audience. As I laughed aloud, almost through the entire picture, it was almost more funny to see the audience reacting to the few people laughing than the film itself. Most people unfamiliar with Andy Kaufman's deeds during his career have misguidedly labelled Man On The Moon as shallow, and although almost all critics have recognized Jim Carrey's performance as truly impressive and unique he is likely to get snubbed again in the 2000 Academy Awards. The truth is, probably no one knew or knows what made Kaufman tick, but who cares. His legacy survives as a comic pioneer not because of who he was, but what he did. Man On The Moon fell out of the top ten at the box office in mere weeks because of what it is, an inside joke for all Kaufman fans.

While _Man on the Moon_ is a well-made film, it presents a portrait of the comedian that simply does not ring true.  I understand that Kaufman was a complex individual whose life cannot be summed up in a satisfying package.  But this movie leaves out the one important aspect of Kaufman's multiple personalities that made him bearable and entertaining his innate sweetness.Jim Carrey does a good job of aping Kaufman's mannerisms, and he does manage to create a three-dimensional, interesting character.  However, his performance is too brutish, too physically intimidating, to really capture what made Kaufman appealing.  Carrey's Kaufman is a complete pain and everyone around him knows it.  The film makes no attempt to explain why George Shapiro promoted the renegade comedian so relentlessly; why Bob Zmuda put up with his bullying; why his parents and his girlfriend weathered the cruelty of his gags; why the entire cast of Taxi admired him despite his prima donna status and his self-centered shenanigans; or why anyone would make a movie honoring such a mean-spirited individual.Whether or not Kaufman was nice is a subject for endless debate.  In interviews concerning Kaufman, his onetime colleagues almost unanimously discuss his good-natured sweetness, his generosity, and his boundless creativity.  It seems incongruous that the selfish star Carrey portrays would inspire such adulation.  At the same time, the movie soft-pedals Kaufman's more irritating moments as well.  When he reads the entire _Great Gatsby_ to his audience, Forman underscores the scene with an orchestral adaptation of the movie's theme song, as if to say What a misunderstood genius!, giving the scene an elegiac quality that is completely misplaced.  Even when Kaufman's acts fail, we are made to feel that audiences were wrong to walk out on him.       As a result, the movie is tremendously unsatisfying.  We are left with no idea why anyone would ever find Kaufman appealing.  As a Kaufman fan, I could at last admire the last moments of the picture for their touching portrayal of Kaufman's battle with cancer.  But I am dismayed to think that for many audience members Carrey's portrayal will be the closest they come to experiencing Andy Kaufman's comic talents.

John Sayles (writer\/director) inadvertently creates a film that mimics its characters in its unrealized potential.This is an exquisitely crafted character study of three people, each with a gift that was never fully realized due to intervening circumstances.  Joe (David Straithairn) was an all state basketball player who blew out his knee and never got a chance to play professionally.  Donna (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) is a talented singer relegated to lounge acts because of her choice in men.  Noelle, Donna's daughter (Vanessa Martinez) is a talent writer and storyteller, who immerses herself in self abuse, self loathing and self pity.Sayles develops each character with great care and we are drawn into their less than perfect lives with a feeling of affection and sympathy.  It is easy for the viewer to find himself pulling hard for these characters.  As the story unfolds, as is almost their fate, they are thrown into another crisis by Joe's screw-up brother.  The characters are tested and show their tenacity to survive yet another of fate's blows.  Sayles draws us in, whets our appetite and then leaves us totally unsatisfied in the ending.The actors played their roles splendidly.  Both greatly underrated Mastantonio and Straithairn had great screen chemistry.  Mastrantonio played the self deluding, self doubting woman who's life revolves around finding a man and played it to perfection.  She also did all her own vocals and has such a beautiful singing voice that one is left wondering why she didn't pursue a second career as a recording artist.  Straithairn reminds me a little of Gary Cooper with his strong quiet type portrayals, except Cooper was always enigmatic and Straithairn plays his characters with more human vulnerability and approachability.  His portrayal of Joe's life of disappointment was exceptional.  Vanessa Martinez shines as the pouty, self hating Noelle.  Even Casey Siemaszko played his part well as Joe's self inflated loser of a brother.I was prepared to give this film a 9 or 10 rating until the ending.  I have seen thousands of films and the ending of this film is undoubtedly the worst I've ever seen.  If I were to tell you the ending, it wouldn't ruin it, that's how bad it was.  Sayles took so much pain to make us love these characters and want them to overcome this crisis and then gives us an ending with no closure.  It was cruel, disappointing and infuriating to the viewers who invested so much emotion in these characters to draw us in and leave us in the state we find ourselves in the final scene.I was so aggravated by the ending that I reduced my rating of this film to a 5.

It was cruel, disappointing and infuriating to the viewers who invested so much emotion in these characters to draw us in and leave us in the state we find ourselves in the final scene.I was so aggravated by the ending that I reduced my rating of this film to a 5.  Like Schubert's unfinished symphony, I'm left wondering why Sayles abandoned such a beautiful project.

What the two films share, however, is the theme of memory (Note also a theme with Hirokazu Kore-eda's documentary work - check out Without Memory, about a man suffering of severe amnesia). In Maboroshi No Hikari Yumiko is not able to forget the memory of her dead husband, whereas in Afterlife the recently deceased must chose one memory that will accompany them into eternity.I feel that Kore-eda handles this entirely hypothetical premise in the best possible way, by steering completely clear of the stylistic superficialities with which so many other films about life after death desperately try to make themselves believable. The unspectacular old school building as a setting, the ceiling window with its interchangeable templates for the different stages of the moon, a character who himself has doubts as to whether this is really the best way of going to the next world and the absence of any religious connotations, among other things, all serve to keep the focus on the characters and their memories - many of whom are actually real. Apart from tongue in cheek humour, the lack of music also prevents over-sentimentalization and makes the memories the people recall the more sincere. The no-budget filming of the recollections of the deceased in order to trigger their personal memory, toward the end of the movie, also illustrates that the director is fully aware of his own limitations and possibilities as a film-maker. Rather than just trying to create the illusion of some half-baked version of the hereafter, he wants to challenge the viewer to reflect on what would be his\/her most important memory - and succeeds in every way.This is a movie that surly can be appreciated by anyone who possesses at least a tiniest inkling of openness and willingness to experience cinema as more than mere entertainment.

Double Indemnity, Witness for the Prosecution and Some Like it Hot were in their own right, masterpieces, but of them all, this is probably the one most overlooked. It hasn't the humourous comedy of Some Like It Hot, nor the suspenseful dilemma of Double Indemnity or the compelling wonderings of Witness for the Prosecution. Its theme, the brutal, hard hitting effects of alcoholism. What makes it fresh after almost 60 years in release is the continual lurking problem itself.

In a time where gaudy musicals and cheesy comedies ruled the Tinseltown roost, the arrival of a film like The Lost Weekend could not have come at a better time. The best picture of 1945 is still as effective as ever, compelling in its mastery, delivering on its promises without a waste of words or a waste of the Paramount megabucks.Ray Milland, as the tormented writer gave one of the best performances I have ever seen. Watching his suffering, his confusion, his discontent made it a nail biting experience. His Academy Award that year was extremely well deserved. Alone as the sole subject of this film, it could still make a great movie. It also introduced me to Jane Wyman.

Golden Globe Winner for the part, Robin Williams (Dead Poets Society, Good Will Hunting) himself  is a very nice person indeed. The Julliard graduate, actor is extremely talented and funny. But with all its funny parts I think that a father having to disguise himself as a woman to see his children is a very sad situation. I recommend the movie, and hopefully you will be able to concentrate on the funny parts of the movie more than I did. My favorite quote Mrs. Doubtfire My first day as a woman and I am already having hot flashes.  My favorite Scene When Daniel Hillard is finally allowed to see his children by Miranda Hillard  Sally Field (Norma Rae).

I'm a fan of The Truman Show and so I thougt the premise for this was intersting. So I watched it on the Friday Afternoon, someone had left it halfway through the tape, later I realised why. What had been a very good idea for a film, that could have worked on many levels, many of the levels that people seem to think it does work on (50's vs the 90's), (the US Society) etc. Although I liked the characters and the idea of the film, I found the whole affair turned out be rather mediocre. The film wasn't very credible, and it lacked action, which just resulted in boredom. The full possibilites of the situation, weren't properly explored. The 50's Pleasant Tv-moulded characters who they met do not seem to have a point to them. The messages in this film seem to be very vague, better more dynamic writing what probably bring them about better. The film comes across as a bit of a mish-mash, while they spirit of it is good, and the characters are sond, the rebellious sister from the 90's forced to live in a different role. Many people seem to moved by the atmospherics for the film, but much of it was fantasy based on nothing with any credibility. It may be that I cannot relate to the 50's TV world of the US or something. It just seemed such a mediocre film and such a waste of a good idea. It didn't seem to symbolise anything, because the TV World didn't mean anything, adn they were trying to use color as a symbol. If the film was trying to show us that the 90's were dysfunctional or something, then why does it turn out that Pleasantville is such a dysfunctional place too. Color is sued to symbolise the corruption of the town's innocence, and it was crudely applied, this is contradictive (colour eventually becomes a symbol of freedom). And anyway if those 50's networks had had color, that's how they would have filmed it, people aren't black and white if they have to be, so why is that symbolic. It's all too abstract. However the fact that there still were things I liked about it, were probably enough for some people to like it a lot. They must have clearly understood the abstract sublimial meanigns of the film, which didnt exactly go out of it's way to explain itself. It was just another mediocre movie. However if you can see something in it, then that is great, I was amazed at the praise it got on the IMDB, because I had truly thought that it would have bad reviews. Either we're al being taken in by Hollywood or I'm just dumb and shoukld get back to watching blockbusters, 'cause if you all feel that way about it, it must be good. I'm gonna watch it again, I might get it this time.

There is a good murder mystery at the same time.  People are very prejudice when they haven't even seen it.  Well maybe you should let go of your prejudice and give Basic Instinct a try.  The movie starts off fast.  A famous retired rock-and-roll star called Johnny Boz is murdered and the principal suspect is his girlfriend, Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone).  The detective investigating this case is Nick Curren (Michael Douglas) and his sidekick and at the same time best friend Gus (George Dzundza).  Along the way, the two detectives discover a lot about Catherine and her past.  For one thing, she inherited 110 million dollars when her parents were killed in a boating accident.  She is also a writer and appeared to have written a book about a retired rock-and-roll star who gets murdered by his girlfriend and is writing another one about a detective getting killed by his girlfriend and Douglas is the main character for this book.  There is much more to the movie than what I have written in this summary but I figured that if you were going to watch the movie you wouldn't want to know too much.  Michael Douglas gives a strong performance and Sharon Stone dominates the screen with dangerously seducing personality.
