When I first watched it, it was I think a little after my 1973 psychiatric nursing training in Australia and may well be the year it was made (1975). From hearsay I had learn that conditions in mental institutions were already much improved from previous years yet quite an eye opening for me. At the conclusion of the film I had mixed feelings about it. I found it much exaggerated to what I did know and experienced. Just the same I could identify so many situation that the movie recreated with such perfection that it was uncanny. The patients themselves were much convincing. The group therapy sessions also reminded me what I had resented in some of our own group session where patients were being manipulated to suite the session and or empower the leader rather than the client. The revelation to the main character that many of the patients were voluntary is very well included and worth to remember to be true, well sometimes with a dash of coercion. Randal may be the hero there and may have many points right, none the less is no angel and his sanity is also questionable. I'm not too sure I go along mental health act regarding Illness versus Criminal behaviour, but won't go any further on this subject.I feel some comments got it right. He is a dangerous misfit who's being assessed about possible insanity So we almost end up with a contest with the righteous psycho Vs the wrongful psycho. So back to 2007, I hired the DVD and enjoyed it immensely this time. I've alway been a fan of J. Nicholson, from 5 easy pieces milk bar scene till now hardly ever a disappointment(I'm thinking of something Witches of ...) As for Nurse Ratched, no wonder she won an Oscar for best actress too. Denis de Vito...I thought that guy looked so much like him! I'm retired now and don't have that feeling to protect the image of this industry, not because or retirement but somehow I feel more comfortable about the present situation regarding patients (clients!) treatment these days. (Actually I almost feel that the scale is tilting the other way now). Mental health Care is a very complex situation, still with a huge stigma attached to it despite all kind of attempts to rename, disguise institutions and terminology. Let's face it who would like to have any of those patients discharged from the institution and become their neighbourg? Empathy has its limits. Saying this I also thought of our hero here; Would you like him to become your neighbourg too? But if movies generates a little awareness and soul searching into some of us this is something positive. On my DVD was also a commentary that seems to run along the movie again from producers, and other people. this was very interesting. It said that all (acting) patients. were actually actors, and so realistically that when J. Nicholson who turned up latter through the rehearsal was it seemed a little concerned. Another interesting thing is about him again and his dedication to his work, his homework to his role that made it look so natural. His tirade on the fake baseball game, I think, occurred 12 years earlier! And that apparently lasted much longer that what was taken for the film. Well I would recommend anyone to look at this as much as the movie itself, perhaps if it is your second go at it, watch this first then the movie to appreciate it even more.

For me it's such a guilty pleasure because even though it's good, it is definitely clichéd and the love story in it is so ridiculous. But how can you not love this film? This movie has everything. Violence, nudity, sex, a love story, romance, disaster and special effects. The story line is pretty simple. It's about the Titanic, the unsinkable, biggest ship in the world, at the time. On the morning of April 15, 1912, it hits an iceberg in the North Atlantic and sinks to the bottom of the ocean in less than three hours. Over 1,000 of the 2,000 passengers on board are killed. Pretty simple, right? Well, to add to the drama, there's a love story involved. Rose DeWitt Bukater, played by Kate Winslet, is a wealthy young heir who is engaged to the handsome and rich but arrogant and controlling Cal Hockley, played by Billy Zane. One night she decides to try and commit suicide by jumping off the boat. A poor loner named Jack Dawson, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, sees what she's about to do and coerces her into aborting her decision. As she's climbing back over the railing, she slips and nearly falls into the icy ocean. Jack grabs her arm and pulls her to safety. But two of the ship's crewmen hear her screaming and come to her aid. They see Jack on top of Rose and think he has done something awful to her. He is about to be punished until Rose convinces Cal, her fiancé, that Jack was only saving her after she slipped while looking at the propellers. And from then on Jack is infatuated with Rose. She has stolen his heart. Even though Jack has no money and no ambitions, Rose can't help but fall equally in love with him. He is sweet and charming. After a sweaty fling in a car at the bottom of the ship, the couple go up on deck and embrace. It is then that they see the iceberg and the ship hits it.The first hour of the film focuses on the budding romance between Jack and Rose. It is somewhat entertaining but for me the real entertaining part of the film was the second half, which focuses on how the ship sank after hitting the iceberg. There are plenty of breathtaking special effects. And of course you have to have a clichéd, out of place scene mixed in with it, including Rose's fiancé Cal shooting a round of bullets at Jack and Rose after seeing the two kiss and hug. But then again it's kind of exciting to watch these scenes because they make you think, oh my god, these events are happening while the ship is sinking! This movie was very sappy at times, but it is still a great film to watch. This movie will make you cry, laugh, and keep you on the edge of your seat all at once. There are moments where you will get bored with the love story but it's worth sitting through to see the carnage of the ship sinking. I'm glad this film was a hit. It is definitely one of the greatest films ever made and it's so hard not to love it!! All the actors did fine jobs. I'm glad I have this movie in my collection.

What he showed us was an excerpt from an expressionist French film made in the late 20's, the name escapes me. Before we had reached the climactic scene, every one in the class had already guessed it, as we had seen images so far of a man purposely sharpening a razor blade, and then approaching a complacent woman in a chair and holding wide open one of her eyes. At this point one of the girls in the room rather loudly asked of the tutor, jokingly but in something of a shaky voice, Why are you doing this? This question, I think, could well be the definitive mark of really effective horror, and it was certainly in the back of my mind nearly all of last night as I was watching David Cronenberg's The Fly for the first time. True horror films, by their nature, should strive to get their audience to ask this question, because it means that they are transcending the illusion of moving pictures and becoming a film &#150; suspending disbelief and getting under your skin. Effectiveness aside, however, I believe that the mark of exceptional horror is when the question stems from a concern for the characters' wellbeing, and not your own. With both these thoughts in mind, I suspect that The Fly could well be the second best horror film of all time (behind Kubrick's The Shining, which, I admit, got to first place by completely different criteria. Such is life, I'm afraid).Remade from a 1958 concept starring Vincent Price (and later popularized by The Simpsons), the film follows a pretty archetypical horror premise science gone (of course) horribly wrong. In this case, Jeff Goldblum (in his tour-de-force performance) plays Seth Brundle, an independent scientific visionary who has been slowly designing a device that will change the world as we know it &#150; a Teleporter. When he shows his invention to romantic interest Veronica (Geena Davis), it is not quite ready to handle living tissue (demonstrated on screen in the first instance of quite confronting gore), but as the two grow a relationship and fall in love, the wrinkles in the technology are ironed out and so Brundle takes one small step for man and tests the machine on himself. Unfortunately, in the process of teleportation, his DNA is mixed up with that of a common housefly, and although not immediately transformed, as in the original, the two species soon begin to genetically merge and transform Brundle into a creature that has never existed before &#150; and for damned good reasons.Cronenberg, of course, never shortchanges his audience with graphic gore, and even viewed with the critical eye of Generation Y, the film's mid-eighties effects are still quite sickening, none more so than Goldblum's slow physical transformation. What makes this whole affair really outstanding, however, is his psychological transformation the truly disturbing thing is how front and centre the humanity of these characters and their world is kept. Davis and Goldblum are the heroes in this regard &#150; their chemistry is palpable, and her affection for him struggling against her disgust at what he is becoming, coupled with his own struggle to keep the fly in check, create the kind of riveting discomfort usually only commanded by train-wrecks.I was, in fact, quite strongly reminded of Darren Aronofsky's 2000 film-adaptation of Hubert Selby's novel Requiem for a Dream &#150; although the subject matter differs greatly, both films derive their horror elements most strongly from a place that is completely removed from Horror &#150; and in both examples the source is basically Love. In this sense, the film affects a lot like real life tragedies do, because it begins in a place truly pure and good and unsuspecting, lets its characters discover how wonderful life can be, and then Horror is unjustly, and irrevocably, forced upon them. This is why it is genuinely moving, instead of tacky, when Goldblum resigns to Davis with a regretful and yet matter-of-fact air that (he is) an insect who dreamt (he) was a man, and loved it. But now the dream is over&#133; and the insect is awake. And in true Cronenberg style, this prophecy becomes quite literal in the third act (think Vincent D'Onofrio in Men in Black).Now, in a film that had spent more time on sinister close ups of flies and haunting music cues and not on the bare and essential humanity of the doomed lovers, at this point I probably would have asked Why are you doing this to me? and that could have been the end of it &#150; dismissed as senseless disturbing cinema and forgotten. As Cronenberg, Goldblum and Davis have done it, what I asked was Why are you doing this to them? And that's the kind of film that you don't ever forget.

What he showed us was an excerpt from an expressionist French film made in the late 20's, the name escapes me. Before we had reached the climactic scene, every one in the class had already guessed it, as we had seen images so far of a man purposely sharpening a razor blade, and then approaching a complacent woman in a chair and holding wide open one of her eyes. At this point one of the girls in the room rather loudly asked of the tutor, jokingly but in something of a shaky voice, Why are you doing this? This question, I think, could well be the definitive mark of really effective horror, and it was certainly in the back of my mind nearly all of last night as I was watching David Cronenberg's The Fly for the first time. True horror films, by their nature, should strive to get their audience to ask this question, because it means that they are transcending the illusion of moving pictures and becoming a film &#150; suspending disbelief and getting under your skin. Effectiveness aside, however, I believe that the mark of exceptional horror is when the question stems from a concern for the characters' wellbeing, and not your own. With both these thoughts in mind, I suspect that The Fly could well be the second best horror film of all time (behind Kubrick's The Shining, which, I admit, got to first place by completely different criteria. Such is life, I'm afraid).Remade from a 1958 concept starring Vincent Price (and later popularized by The Simpsons), the film follows a pretty archetypical horror premise science gone (of course) horribly wrong. In this case, Jeff Goldblum (in his tour-de-force performance) plays Seth Brundle, an independent scientific visionary who has been slowly designing a device that will change the world as we know it &#150; a Teleporter. When he shows his invention to romantic interest Veronica (Geena Davis), it is not quite ready to handle living tissue (demonstrated on screen in the first instance of quite confronting gore), but as the two grow a relationship and fall in love, the wrinkles in the technology are ironed out and so Brundle takes one small step for man and tests the machine on himself. Unfortunately, in the process of teleportation, his DNA is mixed up with that of a common housefly, and although not immediately transformed, as in the original, the two species soon begin to genetically merge and transform Brundle into a creature that has never existed before &#150; and for damned good reasons.Cronenberg, of course, never shortchanges his audience with graphic gore, and even viewed with the critical eye of Generation Y, the film's mid-eighties effects are still quite sickening, none more so than Goldblum's slow physical transformation. What makes this whole affair really outstanding, however, is his psychological transformation the truly disturbing thing is how front and centre the humanity of these characters and their world is kept. Davis and Goldblum are the heroes in this regard &#150; their chemistry is palpable, and her affection for him struggling against her disgust at what he is becoming, coupled with his own struggle to keep the fly in check, create the kind of riveting discomfort usually only commanded by train-wrecks.I was, in fact, quite strongly reminded of Darren Aronofsky's 2000 film-adaptation of Hubert Selby's novel Requiem for a Dream &#150; although the subject matter differs greatly, both films derive their horror elements most strongly from a place that is completely removed from Horror &#150; and in both examples the source is basically Love. In this sense, the film affects a lot like real life tragedies do, because it begins in a place truly pure and good and unsuspecting, lets its characters discover how wonderful life can be, and then Horror is unjustly, and irrevocably, forced upon them. This is why it is genuinely moving, instead of tacky, when Goldblum resigns to Davis with a regretful and yet matter-of-fact air that (he is) an insect who dreamt (he) was a man, and loved it. But now the dream is over&#133; and the insect is awake. And in true Cronenberg style, this prophecy becomes quite literal in the third act (think Vincent D'Onofrio in Men in Black).Now, in a film that had spent more time on sinister close ups of flies and haunting music cues and not on the bare and essential humanity of the doomed lovers, at this point I probably would have asked Why are you doing this to me? and that could have been the end of it &#150; dismissed as senseless disturbing cinema and forgotten. As Cronenberg, Goldblum and Davis have done it, what I asked was Why are you doing this to them? And that's the kind of film that you don't ever forget.

While I would never call this movie a classic, in the end, its nothing more than a camp new package for a forgotten theme. In terms of genre, I would say it is a pretty standard example of the written science fiction of the golden age (50's, 60's) combined with some good old Stephen King scares. I just think contemporary movie goers aren't used to science fiction films without things that go boom. Three factors combine to make this movie seem strange its soft science-fiction applications (fiction loosely based on science or fantasy), the age-group of the characters and the comical special effects that make it seem more juvenile. (Perhaps making it more appealing to a younger audience.) These things detract from what is otherwise a lovely ramble down the 80's memory lane, (semi-biographical of the director's) and a perceptive look at a teenage boy's existential crisis. On the whole, I think its a good movie for teenagers and parents to watch. Take the science fiction out of the movie and you'll see a very scary look at how middle class children are raised today. Cared for by well-meaning but wishy-washy parents and confused by sanitized psycho- social babble and drugs.I give the director\/screenwriter some kudos for having the gumption to not just pose the question, but an answer too.

I think what I really love is the challenge of how each subsequent version is going to differ from (or somehow outshine) the last one. Each Cinderella story is infused with new things, old things, and just plain bizarre things. In this telling, there is much more emphasis on the prince- after all, Richard Chamberlain is top billed. Unfortunately, the characterization of his prince Edward is no different from any other fictional depiction of royalty born of privilege, but hating it and wanting to live like 'regular people.' (If these were actual royal figures, such a wish would never commence.) The story also expands roughly a half hour beyond the glass slipper finding its rightful owner, and for me this dragged the film out considerably. Nevertheless, it's still the quintessential fairy story.Yet I am amazed that so many posters hail it as some sort of Kirousawa-like masterpiece. Is this because it's a British film? We always seem to rate European films just a little higher than American ones, calling them high art and so forth. And as critical as so many are especially about musical films recently- RENT, CHICAGO, THE PRODUCERS, and perhaps most acerbically and nastily, DREAMGIRLS- they all seem to turn a deaf ear on this one. I did like the costumes and set pieces, but was not thrilled with most of the Sherman Brothers' score- save two rather exquisite songs. It paces a bit sluggishly and, at 143 minutes, is about 43 minutes too long. There are two saving graces One is in the name of Annette Crosbie. Her fairy godmother is a dream and a scream at the same time. Possessing incredibly dry wit and very sly on the subject of magic, it appears that she works with other famous fairy tale heroines (some of whom are referenced throughout the film). Her introduction to Cinderella as a simple, practical woman who shuns the sparkle and glitter, and seems to want to unionize fairies worldwide, is hilarious. And the rags-to-riches sequence built around the song Suddenly It Happens is magical indeed. (How could it not be, with mice that turn into ballet dancers even before they turn into horses?) The other saving grace is the ball easily some of the most exquisite costumes ever assembled for a period film, all in an amazing rainbow of sherbet-like pastels. The ball sequence is climaxed by a glorious grand waltz, which begins with two dancers on an empty floor, then adds other couples- two and four at a time- joining into the swirling and spinning choreography, until all are waltzing in the same direction and having a marvelous time.

Not only that, but many say Peter O'Toole's performance as T.E. Lawrence is the greatest piece of acting ever to be captured on screen as well. Being that the movie was made 45 years ago, I wasn't going into it thinking I would agree with either statement necessarily. Whether the four hour run time was too daunting to get my hopes up or not, I knew that no matter what, I needed to finally see this film. I was going to go for the ride from Cairo to the Middle East along with the band of Arab tribes trying to take back their land from the Turks.On a technical level, Lawrence of Arabia has few equals. Director David Lean has created something with true epic focus. There are no advanced computer graphics multiplying fake people into huge battle scenes, this had to be done with real extras, sweltering in the desert heat waiting for their opportunity to fight amongst the movie's stars. The scope is wide and Lean is never afraid to show the desert as a desolate wasteland because the shots are beautiful to behold. The British didn't understand what Lawrence saw in the sand, but viewing the landscape shots here, the audience can see the tranquility and beauty that it truly holds. This was a big-budget movie and it shows by the settings besides the desert. When we arrive in Cairo and see the excess with which the soldiers live; its affluence is on display. Not only by the material objects, but also by the soldiers' utter ambivalence to the fight while their Arab counterparts are trekking through the sun-ravaged desert to claim victory.It is this juxtaposition between the British forces and Arab fighters that backbone the film. Yes, T.E. Lawrence is the focal point and his journey from army outcast to Arab liberator is the story arc we follow, but it is the fact that he tries to live in both worlds which really defines the course of actions on display. Credit does have to go to Peter O'Toole for his ability to grow his character throughout and display the emotion and conflict living inside him. Lawrence saw an opportunity to help the Arab tribes regain control of their land despite Britain's refusal to give them artillery. Even at this early moment, he might have suspected this lack of true support as a sign of future motives, but he was so focused on his cause and the fact that he could do anything he set his mind to, he just didn't care. When he finally succeeds with his first mission, he returns a broken man, having killed and seen things he never wanted to see. He knew it was all for the best, though, and needed to stick by his word of setting his new friends into a free land. Only when the men at Cairo, who once laughed at his expense, praise him with accolades and promotions does Lawrence first start becoming a man without a clear purpose. A man that was accepted by no one now finds himself loved by two distinct cultures, and must somehow cope with the success or eventually fall as a result.Besides the excellent performance by O'Toole&#151;intense, sarcastically humorous, and heartbreakingly real throughout&#151;we are also treated to an acting clinic from the supporting players. Omar Sharif is fantastic as the Arab Sheriff Ali who agrees to accompany Lawrence on his suicide mission to take a Turkish outpost. Sharif gives Ali a realistic progression from a man who cannot see a white man surviving anything in their future, to one who would follow Lawrence into Hell if asked. Anthony Quinn is also great as Auda abu Tayi, a leader of a tribe that can be bought by whoever offers most. His interactions with O'Toole are some of the best moments in the film because Lawrence always knows what to say to persuade Auda into doing something for his own interests and not for monetary gain, (although he still likes to take something as a souvenir for his troubles).

Not only that, but many say Peter O'Toole's performance as T.E. Lawrence is the greatest piece of acting ever to be captured on screen as well. Being that the movie was made 45 years ago, I wasn't going into it thinking I would agree with either statement necessarily. Whether the four hour run time was too daunting to get my hopes up or not, I knew that no matter what, I needed to finally see this film. I was going to go for the ride from Cairo to the Middle East along with the band of Arab tribes trying to take back their land from the Turks.On a technical level, Lawrence of Arabia has few equals. Director David Lean has created something with true epic focus. There are no advanced computer graphics multiplying fake people into huge battle scenes, this had to be done with real extras, sweltering in the desert heat waiting for their opportunity to fight amongst the movie's stars. The scope is wide and Lean is never afraid to show the desert as a desolate wasteland because the shots are beautiful to behold. The British didn't understand what Lawrence saw in the sand, but viewing the landscape shots here, the audience can see the tranquility and beauty that it truly holds. This was a big-budget movie and it shows by the settings besides the desert. When we arrive in Cairo and see the excess with which the soldiers live; its affluence is on display. Not only by the material objects, but also by the soldiers' utter ambivalence to the fight while their Arab counterparts are trekking through the sun-ravaged desert to claim victory.It is this juxtaposition between the British forces and Arab fighters that backbone the film. Yes, T.E. Lawrence is the focal point and his journey from army outcast to Arab liberator is the story arc we follow, but it is the fact that he tries to live in both worlds which really defines the course of actions on display. Credit does have to go to Peter O'Toole for his ability to grow his character throughout and display the emotion and conflict living inside him. Lawrence saw an opportunity to help the Arab tribes regain control of their land despite Britain's refusal to give them artillery. Even at this early moment, he might have suspected this lack of true support as a sign of future motives, but he was so focused on his cause and the fact that he could do anything he set his mind to, he just didn't care. When he finally succeeds with his first mission, he returns a broken man, having killed and seen things he never wanted to see. He knew it was all for the best, though, and needed to stick by his word of setting his new friends into a free land. Only when the men at Cairo, who once laughed at his expense, praise him with accolades and promotions does Lawrence first start becoming a man without a clear purpose. A man that was accepted by no one now finds himself loved by two distinct cultures, and must somehow cope with the success or eventually fall as a result.Besides the excellent performance by O'Toole&#151;intense, sarcastically humorous, and heartbreakingly real throughout&#151;we are also treated to an acting clinic from the supporting players. Omar Sharif is fantastic as the Arab Sheriff Ali who agrees to accompany Lawrence on his suicide mission to take a Turkish outpost. Sharif gives Ali a realistic progression from a man who cannot see a white man surviving anything in their future, to one who would follow Lawrence into Hell if asked. Anthony Quinn is also great as Auda abu Tayi, a leader of a tribe that can be bought by whoever offers most.

I remember when this film was first released, so I kinda knew the plot of The Killing. I certainly think Kubrick knew what he was doing, but draw-back when people start writing about genius. I've seen some of his later films, but think the actors\/actresses added a little to the success of this film.Although I enjoyed Sterling Hayden's (Johnny Clay) acting in this film, he was from that gang of characters (especially in this film) who thought they had to deliver their lines as fast as they could get the words out of their mouths, a-la Richard Burton. As another comment pointed-out, the film was made on a few bucks - it showed, but it was admittedly a B film.......all of the other actors who played in so many of that kind of film were brilliant. Marie Windsor (the two-timing, greedy wife) was great in her role.The Killing was of a race-horse, to create a commotion to make a heist of the race-track possible, as was several other situations, ditto. Every detail was planned to the nth degree, and it all worked in-spite-of the characters' personal problems and foibles. The lighting was excellent - but, I could have done with less of the score, which was seen by many to build-up tension.

I'm not one to use the term film-noir too much, because I don't actually know what that means. It's French for dark, maybe. The Killing was interesting to me for the simple reason it showed there are masterminded crimes, and some of them work.....and everyone played their roles well.This is another early movie which will let younger people recognize those films don't need all the colorful explosions, etc. the Killing was an appropos title - everyone got killed, except Johnny Clay.Like other commentators, I knew the plan would unravel when I saw Johnny coming out of the pawn shop with a beat-up suitcase. You can guess what happened to the money.......but, at least, it's busting-open was due to an unforeseen, impossible-to-predict incident.

You only need to look at the likes of Demolition Man or Total Recall to realise that a vision of the future is only as contemporary as when it was formed. TV sci-fi ages very badly - nobody I know thinks Buck Rogers In The 25th Century is cutting edge these days. Not knowing William Gibson or being familiar with his work, something tells me that this decidedly old-skool sci-fi tosh will be remembered for all the wrong reasons. Virtually every sci-fi cliché you can think of is present and correct so if you want imaginative and exciting sci-fi action then look elsewhere.In the future, the world is split between vast corporations who control almost everything and the unfortunate civilian population who have no technology and suffer from a mysterious disease called NAS. Amid this dystopian future, a young man named Johnny (Keanu Reeves) has sacrificed his childhood memories in order to be able to transport data in his head. After uploading a massive file into his brain, Johnny finds himself hunted by the Yakuza led by Shinji (Dennis Akayama) and by an insane cyborg priest (a hilarious Dolph Lundgren). Can Johnny find the access codes to get the information out of his head before it kills him or before the audience drift off into an unconcerned sleep?Looking and feeling like a mid-Eighties relic, Johnny Mnemonic displays more imagination in its casting than it does with anything else. This is another post-apocalyptic future that looks like a discarded and forgotten corner of the Blade Runner set and despite the writing pedigree, the whole thing feels dated and ripped off from almost any other sci-fi film you can think of. Even the tragically dated 3D representation of cyberspace looks little better than The Lawnmower Man. As I've said, the casting is eclectic to say the least - Ice-T, Takeshi Kitano (noooo!) and Henry Rollins are unlikely to work together again and to be honest, that is something we can all take comfort in. Reeves is typically bad and you'd expect that but what you don't expect is Dolph Lundgren hamming it up in a bizarre role as a cyborg street preacher acting as an assassin. Taken as a whole, this is a frankly hilariously bad sci-fi film with little new ideas and less acting quality.It is difficult to find praise with Johnny Mnemonic which really doesn't offer anything in the way of entertainment value. It felt, to me, like a bad graphic novel that had somehow been made into a film. At least a graphic novel could evoke more emotion from a reader than Reeves does in this - he comes across as a selfish, arrogant man who really wouldn't be missed if he died or not. By the time the ending came around (which, frankly, came as a relief), I'd lost all trace of enthusiasm for the movie. I didn't care whether it all came good or not. I split my sides every time Lundgren appeared - maybe he's auditioning for the WWE? Reeves has rarely stooped as low as he did here but consider this your warning if you choose to watch this then you will kick yourself for not listening to others.

Reeves is typically bad and you'd expect that but what you don't expect is Dolph Lundgren hamming it up in a bizarre role as a cyborg street preacher acting as an assassin. Taken as a whole, this is a frankly hilariously bad sci-fi film with little new ideas and less acting quality.It is difficult to find praise with Johnny Mnemonic which really doesn't offer anything in the way of entertainment value. It felt, to me, like a bad graphic novel that had somehow been made into a film. At least a graphic novel could evoke more emotion from a reader than Reeves does in this - he comes across as a selfish, arrogant man who really wouldn't be missed if he died or not. By the time the ending came around (which, frankly, came as a relief), I'd lost all trace of enthusiasm for the movie. I didn't care whether it all came good or not. I split my sides every time Lundgren appeared - maybe he's auditioning for the WWE? Reeves has rarely stooped as low as he did here but consider this your warning if you choose to watch this then you will kick yourself for not listening to others. For once, believe the hype - this film is less fun than a migraine.

From the premise and the fact that the author, Stephen King, was working on the screenplay, this reviewer expected something a little better than the average horror film. Unfortunately, it is just barely an average horror flick. There will not be any comparisons to the novel, because this reviewer has yet to read it. However, judging from the results of the film, this reviewer is not excited to read it.Pet Sematary is based on the novel written by Stephen King. The Creeds have just moved to a new house in the countryside. Their house is perfect, except for two things the semi-trailers that roar past on the narrow road, and the mysterious cemetery, which is misspelled to spell sematary, in the woods behind the house. The Creed's neighbors are reluctant to talk about the cemetery. Is there really something wrong with the cemetery or is the neighborhood extremely crazy?There is no question that this movie could have been a lot better. The movie was not exactly horrible. There were some good little creepy moments throughout. Unfortunately, the tension was never consistent until the very end. Sadly, that sequence towards the end felt like the typical 1980's slasher. Not only that, but the film score, which usually is key in this type of movie, is essentially nonexistent.The acting was very mediocre. Luckily, for this type of movie, the acting is never a necessity. Dale Midkiff played the father, Lois Creed. Fred Gwynne was really the best part of the film, as the neighbor, Jud Crandall. Denise Crosby was Lois' wife, Rachel Creed. Brad Greenquist, along with Fred Gwynee, was the best part as a guardian angel, Victor Pascow. Child star, Miko Hughes, played the youngest son, Gage Creed. Blaze Berdahl played the daughter, Ellie Creed.Overall, even though this reviewer pointed out some flaws, Pet Sematary is still a recommended one-time viewing. Some people loved it, so maybe you might be one of them. Some people consider this underrated and a classic, but this reviewer feels it is not even close. Maybe the 2008 remake will be better. Go rent this flick, see it, and then quickly forget about most of it the next day.

This makes for an equally unstoppable force wanting to wipe out the alien bugs. The intelligent humans are sent off to military intelligence and\/or commissioned as officers while the more athletic i.e. stupid, are used for the front line.Propaganda clips in the Earth media also add to the feel of an extreme right-wing state and the pressure for young people to join the fight against the bugs - you can't obtain full citizenship unless you enlist.Anyway all good action to boot.
