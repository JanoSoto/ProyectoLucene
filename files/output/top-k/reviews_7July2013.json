[{"date":"7 July 2013","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Romantic Comedy is a genre that has really tapered off in the last decade or so. The genre has become so dependent on sex, for both the romance and comedy, that watching such a sincere film as You've Got Mail makes you realize how sweet and funny movies of this type can be.The film centers around Joe Fox (Tom Hanks), owner of a book superstore Fox Books, and Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan), owner of a small mom and pop bookstore The Shop Around the Corner. Bitter business rivals by day but, unbeknownst to them, anonymous e-mail pen pals by night. Naturally of course they fall in love with each other through the e-mails despite a strict no personal information pact. The film uses this setup to use dramatic irony for many of the jokes but also for character development.The key to romance in fiction, comedy or not, is to make it about characters and their relationships with each other. The best romances (When Harry Met Sally..., The Notebook, Whisper of the Heart, and even pieces of Welcome to the NHK) develop themselves around their characters. But what this type of film needs more than anything but so rarely does is heart and to believe in its characters and events. This is how You've Got Mail succeeds, it makes itself about the characters. So while not a deep film, by doing that it allows itself to be sweet, funny, and believable. Funny and romantic (what a movie in a genre called Romantic Comedy should be), You've Got Mail is such a nice little film that even us cynics at heart can't help but smile.

While far from a good movie, and certainly nowhere near as fun, thrilling or intense as Jurassic Park, I was expecting far worse than what I saw. Diane Ladd relishes her mad scientist, and this is one totally bonkers mad scientist, and the baby carnosaur is genuinely scary. Carnosaur is also gorier and bloodier than JP, and the gore is actually quite good and has moments where it is used inventively to the extent that you may be put off eating for some time after. Carnosaur is a very cheap-looking movie though, the sets lack colour and the camera work and editing lack finesse and cohesion. But I agree about the special effects and the animatronics on the dinosaurs faring worst in this regard, they are truly dreadful and definitely some of the worst dinosaur effects I've seen for any movie in my life. The score is not particularly rousing and has nothing that leaps out as memorable. It doesn't distract from what's going on as such but it just doesn't add anything either, it's just there and fails to make much of an impact. The script doesn't work either, nor does the story. The dialogue is stodgy, cheesy and overly-talky, while the story- not doing much with a decent if rather silly concept- apart from some inventive gory scenes is stripped of suspense, scenes that should scare can be unintentionally funny instead, the romantic plot line is mawkish and slows things down in the middle and the prehistoric rampage antics do get predictable quickly. The characters read of every cliché the writers could find and are poorly developed, no scratch that, the movie certainly knows what it tries to be which is good but while it does strive for some fun and scares(though not really succeeding) the characters are almost completely forgotten in the process. Of the acting only Ladd makes any kind of impression, the rest just sleepwalk through their roles and don't seem to care less about their characters' situations. Overall, could have been worse, especially considering what I'd read, but not a good movie. I recommend it partially for those who want a bit of silly fun without having to think too much, but for those who does know what to expect but still want to see some kind of quality put into it they may want to look elsewhere. 4\/10 Bethany Cox ","genre":null},{"date":"7 July 2013","score":"","review":" Reading about Carnosaur, I was expecting a terribly cheap movie and for it to be blatantly derivative of the Steven Spielberg classic Jurassic Park.
