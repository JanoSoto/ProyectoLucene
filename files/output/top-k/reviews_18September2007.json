The final conclusion is that they want happiness, just like men.Despite being a predictable movie and nothing extraordinary, at least it teaches to us (men) some valuable lessons about women. It's a good way to understand and know them better.The first hour of this movie is great fun, very entertaining and pure comedy. During the first hour we have some moments to give us good laughs. Mel Gibson has never been this funny before. He plays a hilarious character Nick Marshall, a typical macho men or a men's man. The kind of man that other men admire and want to be like him. The kind of man who doesn't understand a thing about women (although seen as a God's gift to women). Nick is proud, rich, chauvinistic, single and loves to hear Frank Sinatra.After an accident with the hairdryer, he suddenly has the power of hearing what women think and what they think of him isn't what he expected. He sees this as a curse, but after being convinced by a psychologist that he could take advantage of this gift, he uses it to manipulate Darcy McGuire.However, in the second half, the movie fails, becoming predictable and somehow lame, losing all its comical side. Some ridiculous and silly things happen in the second half. Also, I rather the old Nick than the good Nick, because the old Nick was much funnier. He becomes the good guy in the second half, losing his sense of humor.This movie has some nice songs, such as I Won't Dance (performed by Frank Sinatra), I've Got You Under My Skin (performed by Frank Sinatra in a duet with Bono) and Bitch (performed by Meredith Brooks).Mel Gibson is great and charming as Nick Marshall, while Helen Hunt is okay and pretty in the role of Darcy McGuire.

Made in 1987, it turned out to be his last association with the teen genre before moving on to other areas of interest. Its a film that's never achieved the classic status of Hughes' other films of the time like Ferris Bueller's Day Off or The Breakfast Club. Even though I found it to be just as entertaining, and even rewarding.If you've ever seen Pretty in Pink, made the year previously, then you will notice some astonishing similarities. They both focus on a teenage love triangle. A high school misfit falls for a popular Senior while off to the side, a rebel who's friends with the misfit pines for them from afar. The only thing that differs is the ending. In PIP, misfit and popular Senior end up together. In SKOW, misfit ends up with rebel.Both films were written by John Hughes, and I think with SKOW, he got to make the film he originally envisioned. Hughes was allegedly unhappy with the way PIP ended. It was an ending that was forced upon him by the studio. I must admit I never really cared all that much for Pretty in Pink. The characters just weren't that interesting. Some Kind of Wonderful on the other hand is everything that film wasn't.The difference I think is all in the casting. Eric Stoltz offers a quiet but solid assessment of the part of Keith, the struggling artist who doesn't quite fit in at school. Lea Thompson plays with strength and depth as Amanda, the Prom Princess with issues of her own. And best of all is Mary Stewart Masterson as Watts, the non-conformist who longs for Keith in silence.Nobody quite makes a teen film like John Hughes. He has this ability to take generic material and infuse it with surprising depth and intelligence. And humour value too. When he moved on to adult films, he seemed quite out of his element. Probably because he seems a little awkward when trying to write them as anything other than stereotypes. The one exception was Planes, Trains & Automobiles, but that was down to the superbly nuanced acting of Steve Martin and especially John Candy.The adults in Hughes' teen films usually come off as alien, distant and uncomprehending of their children. Some Kind of Wonderful may be the one time where he gets that area right.Keith's father Cliff (John Ashton) wants his son to go off to college. I like the way he puts his point acrossYou could go on to a job where you don't have to wash your hands after a hard day's work.Keith would rather become an artist than have his life mapped out for him by his father. And when I saw SKOW the first time, I was expecting Hughes to fumble it, and turn Cliff into an indifferent monster. But I was surprised by Keith and Cliff's confrontation. Their heart-to-heart is quite well written on Hughes' part, and he allows both characters ample room to breathe. Cliff may be the closest thing to a sympathetic adult in a Hughes teen film.But its the young cast that make all the right moves. The central love triangle could be viewed as predictable, but the acting goes some way towards making Some Kind of Wonderful more entertaining than it has a right to be.Amanda could be regarded as a popular Ms Chic right at the top of the high school tree. And granted she only gets involved with Keith as a spur of the moment thing to spite her ex, but there are some depths to her character. She admits she makes bad decisions from time to time. But she would rather be with a gaggle of popular schoolgirls instead of feeling lonely all the time.But Watts is the one character to tune into. Mary Stewart Masterson does a great job fleshing out what's already a well written character. Her silent love for Keith is touching, and she's a walking voice of wisdom. Her curse is to see everything as it really is. She's so astute that its no wonder she's so alienated from everyone else around her at high school. Hughes may have trouble writing adult characters, but as for teenagers he's got them nailed.And there's a nice line of supporting characters too. I especially liked Laura, Keith's younger sister, played by Maddie Corman. Like Watts, she's astute and attuned to the world around her in ways most pre-teens only dream of. And I also liked Duncan, played by Elias Koteas. At first glance he seems a punk from detention, but becomes a surprisingly valued ally to Keith. Its all the more satisfying because I never saw it coming.Keith and Amanda's relationship hits a few bumps along the road. Too many as it turns out. Something that gets pointed out to them frequently. The ending is not all that unexpected, and it does come a little too abruptly, but I really enjoyed Some Kind of Wonderful. Its got a great cast of young actors and hits a lot of the right notes. It doesn't deserve obscurity. Its just as good as any of John Hughes' other teen films.A fine piece of work from a man who turned out some of the best teen movies the world had ever seen.

The reason why I didn't watch it was that I was expecting one of the most disturbing films ever, so I never wasn't really in the mood so to speak. I wanted to see it, but it seemed like there never wasn't time for a movie like it. So one day I decided What the heck? I have to see it in some point anyways.. so I watched it with my brother and friend. Looking at the trailers, the reviews, the plot outlines and everything it had to be sick, right? Well, the disturbance level wasn't even near the level I personally was expecting. Honestly, it isn't even disturbing apart from a couple of scenes.The movie tells about what the title says, a teenager named Donnie Darko. Donnie may seem like an ordinary American guy, who lives with his family in a sleepy suburb. Nothing could be farther away from the truth; 18-year old Donnie has a large bunny rabbit named Frank as his imaginary friend, who inspires Donnie to do things which seem to be unreasonable. Frank saves Donnie's life when a huge aeroplane's engine falls in middle of the boy's room. Donnie investigates the bizarre accident and finds out unbelievable things that lets him to manipulate the streams of time and space. Donnie travels through daring and secret paths, he tries to understand the chaotic, raging universe around him and he finally sees the truth; Even the smallest acts can have serious consequences.The film itself is a great blend of science fiction, mystery and drama. It cleverly leaps between the real world and the imaginary world, and it does it with such a credibility that the viewer won't get lost in any part of the movie, it stays in a tight package throughout. The screenplay is fantastic, it doesn't bother you with any unnecessary or pointless subplots or scenes, it stays in the main theme all the time and the end solution is just brilliant. Through the vision of Richard Kelly, who has written and directed the film, Donnie Darko offers you an intensive and interesting movie experience, which can not be compared to any other films because it's also original and pretty unique in its own genre. Although the film is pretty dark and gloomy, it still doesn't affect you as much as you could imagine, as the story's just so interesting you'll get hooked to it and instead of thinking how dark the movie is you keep on thinking of the twists and turns, and how brilliant the movie itself is.Donnie is played by Jake Gyllenhaal who is outstanding in the role. Just like the leaping between the real world and the imaginary world in the story, also the character itself changes between these leaps which makes it pretty enjoyable to watch because of Gyllenhaal's strength on the screen. The character progresses really well too, as when we start off the movie the character is totally different in both of the worlds but as we move along the character crafts into a person who's surprisingly similar in the real world and the imaginary one. There are good actors in other roles too, for example Maggie Gyllenhaal, Patrick Swayze, Drew Barrymore and Katharine Ross, but they are left out in minor roles as the film concentrates on Donnie after all. These characters of the supporting actors do not have that depth like the main character does, but their purpose is in fact more like complimenting the character of Donnie, which is also pretty genius. Soundtrack is also marvellous; The music's composed by Michael Andrews and like the movie itself the music also mixes between soft and dark pieces of fine compositions. It's sometimes beautiful and it's sometimes really dark like the main theme, which works really well with the build-up of the film.Donnie Darko is definitely one to watch, but only if you're open minded with films or if you just happen to be a sci-fi addict. If you're expecting heavy disturbance like I was don't be fooled, as even when you get something disturbing it isn't nearly as disturbing as you could imagine, so don't let the plot outlines or trailers fool you. To me Donnie Darko is all in all a great movie and at times it's pretty thrilling as well. It isn't sick or gross, it's a fine piece of film making which works really well in all of its styles, drama, mystery and sci-fi. Although it is a short film you should watch it when you really have the time for it, as it's just not one of those movies you can watch when ever you want to, it requires that certain mood which I was telling you about. Even when this is a movie which probably (and still) gets mixed opinions from really negative to really positive you should just see it yourself and make up your own mind. No-one's going to make it up for you anyways, so it's your decision.

Soundtrack is also marvellous; The music's composed by Michael Andrews and like the movie itself the music also mixes between soft and dark pieces of fine compositions. It's sometimes beautiful and it's sometimes really dark like the main theme, which works really well with the build-up of the film.Donnie Darko is definitely one to watch, but only if you're open minded with films or if you just happen to be a sci-fi addict. If you're expecting heavy disturbance like I was don't be fooled, as even when you get something disturbing it isn't nearly as disturbing as you could imagine, so don't let the plot outlines or trailers fool you. To me Donnie Darko is all in all a great movie and at times it's pretty thrilling as well. It isn't sick or gross, it's a fine piece of film making which works really well in all of its styles, drama, mystery and sci-fi. Although it is a short film you should watch it when you really have the time for it, as it's just not one of those movies you can watch when ever you want to, it requires that certain mood which I was telling you about. Even when this is a movie which probably (and still) gets mixed opinions from really negative to really positive you should just see it yourself and make up your own mind. No-one's going to make it up for you anyways, so it's your decision.

The reason why I didn't watch it was that I was expecting one of the most disturbing films ever, so I never wasn't really in the mood so to speak. I wanted to see it, but it seemed like there never wasn't time for a movie like it. So one day I decided What the heck? I have to see it in some point anyways.. so I watched it with my brother and friend. Looking at the trailers, the reviews, the plot outlines and everything it had to be sick, right? Well, the disturbance level wasn't even near the level I personally was expecting. Honestly, it isn't even disturbing apart from a couple of scenes.The movie tells about what the title says, a teenager named Donnie Darko. Donnie may seem like an ordinary American guy, who lives with his family in a sleepy suburb. Nothing could be farther away from the truth; 18-year old Donnie has a large bunny rabbit named Frank as his imaginary friend, who inspires Donnie to do things which seem to be unreasonable. Frank saves Donnie's life when a huge aeroplane's engine falls in middle of the boy's room. Donnie investigates the bizarre accident and finds out unbelievable things that lets him to manipulate the streams of time and space. Donnie travels through daring and secret paths, he tries to understand the chaotic, raging universe around him and he finally sees the truth; Even the smallest acts can have serious consequences.The film itself is a great blend of science fiction, mystery and drama. It cleverly leaps between the real world and the imaginary world, and it does it with such a credibility that the viewer won't get lost in any part of the movie, it stays in a tight package throughout. The screenplay is fantastic, it doesn't bother you with any unnecessary or pointless subplots or scenes, it stays in the main theme all the time and the end solution is just brilliant. Through the vision of Richard Kelly, who has written and directed the film, Donnie Darko offers you an intensive and interesting movie experience, which can not be compared to any other films because it's also original and pretty unique in its own genre. Although the film is pretty dark and gloomy, it still doesn't affect you as much as you could imagine, as the story's just so interesting you'll get hooked to it and instead of thinking how dark the movie is you keep on thinking of the twists and turns, and how brilliant the movie itself is.Donnie is played by Jake Gyllenhaal who is outstanding in the role. Just like the leaping between the real world and the imaginary world in the story, also the character itself changes between these leaps which makes it pretty enjoyable to watch because of Gyllenhaal's strength on the screen. The character progresses really well too, as when we start off the movie the character is totally different in both of the worlds but as we move along the character crafts into a person who's surprisingly similar in the real world and the imaginary one. There are good actors in other roles too, for example Maggie Gyllenhaal, Patrick Swayze, Drew Barrymore and Katharine Ross, but they are left out in minor roles as the film concentrates on Donnie after all. These characters of the supporting actors do not have that depth like the main character does, but their purpose is in fact more like complimenting the character of Donnie, which is also pretty genius. Soundtrack is also marvellous; The music's composed by Michael Andrews and like the movie itself the music also mixes between soft and dark pieces of fine compositions.

Woody Allen's film is obviously the superior of the two, but I have a soft spot for Neil Simon's comedy, and I like it quite a lot.Richard Dreyfuss was on the cusp of stardom after his performance in Jaws, and his double score this year with The Goodbye Girl and Close Encounters of the Third Kind launched him into the big time. Marsha Mason was perfect at playing roles like this -- vulnerable softies looking for love while at the same time tough cookies who could make it on their own if forced to. In this film, the two meet cute when Dreyfuss shows up at Mason's apartment, having subletted it from Mason's boyfriend, who dumped her and took off without telling her that she and her ten-year-old daughter would be left with no place to live. Dreyfuss, a struggling actor, agrees to let the mom and daughter stay in the apartment with him, and of course after much bickering, the two fall in love. The movie is at its best when Dreyfuss and Mason are fighting. My favorite line is delivered by Mason after one of their many run-ins over Dreyfuss's bohemian living habits I don't know you well enough to truly dislike you, but you are just too weird to live with. Quinn Cummings gives an adorable performance as Mason's daughter. She manages to be both precocious and cute (think Tatum O'Neal in Paper Moon), a tough feat for a child actor.

Maybe I've become desensitised to really violent imagery but while looking at a film like Under Siege & even more so in it's sequel one can't help but feel violence is being glamorised, Seagal's character Casey Ryback is as brutal & vicious as any of the bad guy's here & the film becomes a constant barrage of ever increasing violent sequences of him killing the bad guy's & considering he is meant to be the hero he's not setting a great example. I must admit that I'm not too happy with the overall 'fight violence with even more violence' message that this film portrays in no uncertain terms, don't get me wrong because I like some ass kicking violence but sometimes one can question just what sort of example these types of films are setting. Having said that this moves along at a nice enough pace, it has a good solid good vs. bad guy story with decent character's & there's plenty of action & violence that will satisfy most action flick junkies.Director Davis does a good job here, there's a nice claustrophobic feel to the tight galley-ways & corridors.

There are loads of shootings & bloody bullet wounds, people are blown up by grenades, people are slashed with knives, stabbed, shoved into band saws, eyes & throats are gouged out, people are crushed by falling metal beams & someone gets a huge combat knife stuck in their head. Again I don't normally mind some gory violence but it just seemed to me that the supposed hero played by Seagal was taking as much pleasure in hurting & killing people as the bad guy's & that just sat a bit uneasily with me.With a supposed budget of about $35,000,000 this did great business at the box-office, it's well made with that big budget Hollywood action flick feel about it with over-the-top explosions & huge set-pieces. The USS Alabama battleship museum in Mobile in Alabama was used as the USS Missouri.

","genre":"Comedy"},{"date":"18 September 2007","score":"","review":" Being just born when the show originally ran, I probably had last seen The Brady's back in the late 70's, early 80's during reruns on TV and had only remembered bits and pieces since then. Snippets like Bobby saving a girl from a falling shelf, orange hair and some sort of model volcano explosion. Nothing very distinctive at all. So when the movie came out in '95, I gave it a shot and didn't like it at all. It just seemed like another fish-out-of-water movie, and the jokes were of the inside type, which was to be expected for a movie based on a TV show. They just weren't funny. So I dismissed the movie (which apparently was pretty popular) and didn't even bother with it's sequel, which came out the next year.Fast forward ten years to 2005. Thanks to the wonders of TV-on-DVD, I took another shot and bought the 1st season of The Brady Bunch and immediately got hooked. As I watched the episodes,those snippets suddenly became cohesive and the memories flowed back in. The warm, fuzzy, memories of a simpler time with the impossibly perfect family. As I eagerly awaited the subsequent season releases over the next year and a half, I held off on giving The Brady Bunch Movie a second chance until I had seen every episode again. I'm glad I did. Basically what I'm trying to say is that you definitely need to be familiar with the show, to fully appreciate the movie(s).As I mentioned previously the movie takes the fish-out-of-water, squeaky-clean 70's Brady's and places them in the 90's. While you get your usual riffs on the culture clash enveloped in a pedestrian plot (albeit, their oblivious attitude is good for some laughs), the real comedic meat comes from the spoofing of the show. Swollen noses, squeaky voices, inner monologues, Marcia, Marcia, Marcia, the life lessons, the clothes, breaking into song. It's all there in their glorious cheesiness, deftly presented by the cast, with special kudos going to the spot-on portrayals of Mr. & Mrs. Brady, Marcia, Jan & Alice. Actually Ben Stiller probably says to himself every day, I can't believe I landed Marcia Brady! Christine Taylor IS Marcia Brady. And look for some great cameos as well.Good, hilarious fun for Brady fans. Of course after this, I just had to run out and get A Very Brady Sequel, which is even better! Incest! The real Mr. Brady!

Two then-unknowns, Nicholas Cage and Holly Hunter - both future award-winners, and deservedly so - play the most unlikely of couples. Cage is Hi, an armed (I use quotation marks because he normally makes sure the gun he carries is not really loaded) convenience-store robber. Upon being arrested, he meets a lovely little police officer named Ed (Hunter) and does not let the circumstances stop him from flirting with her (What kind of name is Ed for a pretty thing like you? Her answer Short for Edwina. Turn to the RIGHT!) Upon the occasion of his second arrest, he notices that his Officer Ed has clearly been crying. She reveals to him that her fiancée has dumped her for another woman, and he responds by calling her ex a fool for leaving her. Hi serves his time and meets other inmates including a trustee (I assume) who simply growls at him as he passes by and two other convicted armed robbers\/brothers (John Goodman and William Forsythe; these guys are geniuses at casting). Upon his release, He and Ed are married (Okay, then, says the pastor who performs the ceremony after they say their I-do's). But something is wrong in paradise. You see, Ed BADLY wants to have a child - or children - and after some time trying to conceive on their own, they decide to see a doctor, who gives them the news that Ed is infertile. Upon trying to adopt, they are rejected because of Hi's, as Ed herself puts it, checkered past. But then, they see on television that a local millionaire furniture-store owner who goes by the name Nathan Arizona and his wife have just had a set of quintuplets due to the wife's use of fertility drugs. Rationalizing that it won't be so bad to take one baby from a couple who already have four others, they proceed to kidnap one of the tots (Nathan Junior, they think) and bring him home.But of course, complications ensue. You see, our two brother-convicts have escaped, and who do they seek out? None other than their prison buddy Hi. Needless to say, Ed is not thrilled with this turn of events. Meanwhile, Hi has lost his job due to beating up his boss (after said boss, while at their house for a barbecue, tells him that he and his wife are swingers and wants to know if Hi would ever consider wife-swappin.) Hi cannot bring himself to tell Ed that he lost his job for defending her honor, and this causes tension between the two. So much so that, although he has turned down a chance to join in a bank heist with the escaped-con brothers, he decides to rob a convenience store he goes into with the intention of getting diapers for the nipper (which he does, just before he pulls an unloaded gun on the clerk and orders him to empty the till). Seeing what he is doing, Ed decides to leave him there, driving off and taking the baby with her. Meanwhile, it turns out the teenage, braces-wearing clerk has a (loaded) gun of his own, and has no qualms about using it. There follows a chase scene that must be seen to be believed.

Moulin Rouge throws a surprising twist on what seems to be an overused theme of love in Hollywood. Is it overused? Well, after watching this film, I found myself reconsidering the meaning of love as a cinematic theme and concluded that my previous definition was to be taken off the shelf; it is now well expired.It is a movie I entered with ambivalent to low expectations. For all I knew, I was in for another ride down the musical roller coaster, and this one was going to make me really sick (oh no, here comes another long song about love, where's the barf bag?) Instead, I was treated to one of the most phenomenal stories ever captured on film, told with such creativity and originality that I knew there had to something wrong with it. How am I so easily falling for this fantasy\/comedy\/musical\/drama\/documentary&#151;(wait, did I say documentary? Well yes, this was a fantastic narrative that was really told biographically, so in a let's-not-get-too-technical-about-film-terms sort of way, was a fictional documentary).And I thought I'd seen and heard it all just when I realized, wait, I did. Most all of the songs performed were readapted famous singles already made famous by such artists as Elton John, Madonna, The Police, and Nirvana, yet I found every performance to be beyond delightful, entertaining, amusing, and most of all, inventive; these performances pieced together every mood of the story, collectively seducing me, and with no sense of time, I was in love with this movie.Moulin Rouge sets not only a standard for musicals but a standard for the entire film industry. When the next movie comes along with musical performances that seem to actually improve the original song, more than impressive booming vocal performances by the two leads, a story that carries the viewer a fantasy world that for once feels so real, I'll be the first person to buy the ticket. But wait, on second thought, I must keep in mind the old saying, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. This film deserves to be that single original gem, and should never be sought to be improved, recreated, or just copied in the form of another unoriginal film, instead, this cinematic achievement should be set aside and just appreciated and glorified for all that it has accomplished.

Basically, a down-on-his-luck bartender, Randy (Matt Dillon), his cocky cousin Carl Harding (Paul Reiser) and murder investigation Detective Dehling (John Goodman) all have something in common, they have seen the girl of their dreams (whether married or not), and they would do anything to please and be with her, even die. All three met\/saw her one night at McCool's, the bar that Randy worked at, they have no knowledge of each other, but all three cannot stop thinking of Femme Fetale Jewel Valentine (The Lord of the Rings' Liv Tyler). All three are telling their stories to someone they hope will listen to their pretty intense and revealing stories, Randy talks to hit-man Mr. Burmeister (Michael Douglas, who co-produced the film), Carl to psychologist\/psychiatrist Dr. Green (Reba McEntire) and Dehling to priest Father Jimmy (Richard Jenkins). They confess all details of what they have been willing to do, their sexual contact with her, and eventually they are all brought together in one place, all intent on being with her, and all involved with the final shootout that leaves one dead, one running away (and eventually dying) and one stunned, and the unexpected guy she chooses (but at the same time obvious, cos it's sex-obsessed Douglas). Also starring Andrew Dice Clay as Utah\/Elmo and Sandy Martin as Bingo Vendor Woman. If I had to pick a favourite moment, it would definitely be what was mentioned at number 11 along with Cool Hand Luke on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments, where Tyler copycats the woman washing the car with suds all over herself, and in front of Goodman, very sexy! Apart from that, not the most memorable film. Okay!
