Gone with the Wind is a very good movie, perhaps bordering on being great, but its subject matter and running time. Gone with the Wind is, simply put, a tale of two halves. The movie is divided by an intermission into a pair of roughly-equal segments. Then first, which is brilliant and consistently captivating, covers the time period of the Civil War, ending during Sherman's march through Atlanta. The post-intermission half, which dishes out the suds, picks up at the end of the Civil War and concludes about eight years later. This portion of Gone with the Wind, spins its wheels frequently. Theatrically, Gone with the Wind is an entirely different experience from its small-screen counterpart; some of the second-half narrative tedium is effaced by the glorious visuals. With a restored three- strip. Gone with the Wind has one of the best-known story lines of any film. Is Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh), the spoiled, manipulative daughter of an Irish immigrant plantation owner (Thomas Mitchell). Scarlett has two sisters, but she is by far the most spirited of the three O'Hara girls, and her father, seeing her as his successor, teaches her lessons about the importance of the land. Scarlett is secretly in love with Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard), who is about to marry the gentle, demure Melanie Hamilton (Olivia De Havilland). When Scarlett confesses her love to Ashley, he admits his feelings for her, but notes that Melanie will make a much better wife. Immediately after this meeting, Scarlett has her first encounter with the irrepressible Rhett Butler (Clark Gable), the cynical, smart hero who eventually falls in love with her. They are two headstrong likes who simultaneously repel and attract one another. Ultimately, when Rhett has finally had enough, he walks out of her life to her plaintive query about what she's supposed to do without him. The pre-intermission portion of Gone with the Wind, which runs about 115 minutes, is glorious from both a visual and an emotional standpoint. It's a grand tale of love and loss in the midst of this country's most bitter war. Most importantly, it shows Scarlett's development from a vain, spoiled brat into a hardened, determined young woman. Her relationship with Rhett is there, but kept carefully in the background. There is sadness, humor, and a number of breathtaking shots of Scarlett silhouetted against a reddish sunset. Gone with the Wind stands as a romantic monument to the Old South -- an homage to an era and a lifestyle long gone. To date, no film has sold more box-office tickets than Gone with the Wind. Domestically, the tally almost doubles that for the phenomenally-popular Titanic. Of course, when the movie was first released, it wasn't just another motion picture -- it was a spectacle, an event. Even though the habits of movie- goers have changed over the years, it's easy to see why this film provoked such an outpouring of praise and adulation during its initial release, and why its stature has grown with the passage of decades. Gone with the Wind has flaws, but it's still undeniably a classic and a legend.

While it has a strong civil rights message that is the core of the film, it is also a great family story. This comes out early in the film as Jem and Scout, Peck's two children, meet up with Dill, the boy staying next door for the summer. It is a small town where children play and explore the neighbourhood. We see a mad dog that Atticus shoots to spare his family from any attack and a house that the neighbours avoid out of fear of what lies within it. Mary Badham and Philip Alford are Scout and Jem, the two children of Atticus Finch. Atticus is a single father and a lawyer whose wife died several years earlier. Atticus spends time with his children and answers their questions in an honest and loving way. When a judge comes by to ask him to take on a case of alleged assault by a black man, Atticus knows he will be taking on a huge burden in a town where blacks are up against bigotry and ignorance. Yet, he agrees right off. No discussion with a judge...just a simple yes to the judge's question. It is clear that the accused black man is innocent but justice for blacks does not come easily with the climate in this town. During the trial, all the black people look down from the balcony above in the segregated courtroom, symbolic of their distance from laws that govern them. At the end of the trial, they all stand in unison when Atticus leaves. Atticus is a great role model for his community, a lawyer and parent who raises his children and fights for justice in his own town. There is a lesson in how to be a good neighbour toward the end that puts an end to a neighbourhood fallacy.

","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"29 January 2015","score":"","review":" An outstanding movie with Gregory Peck, To Kill a Mockingbird is based on the Harper Lee novel set during the Depression of the 1930's. While it has a strong civil rights message that is the core of the film, it is also a great family story. This comes out early in the film as Jem and Scout, Peck's two children, meet up with Dill, the boy staying next door for the summer. It is a small town where children play and explore the neighbourhood. We see a mad dog that Atticus shoots to spare his family from any attack and a house that the neighbours avoid out of fear of what lies within it. Mary Badham and Philip Alford are Scout and Jem, the two children of Atticus Finch. Atticus is a single father and a lawyer whose wife died several years earlier. Atticus spends time with his children and answers their questions in an honest and loving way. When a judge comes by to ask him to take on a case of alleged assault by a black man, Atticus knows he will be taking on a huge burden in a town where blacks are up against bigotry and ignorance. Yet, he agrees right off. No discussion with a judge...just a simple yes to the judge's question. It is clear that the accused black man is innocent but justice for blacks does not come easily with the climate in this town. During the trial, all the black people look down from the balcony above in the segregated courtroom, symbolic of their distance from laws that govern them. At the end of the trial, they all stand in unison when Atticus leaves. Atticus is a great role model for his community, a lawyer and parent who raises his children and fights for justice in his own town. There is a lesson in how to be a good neighbour toward the end that puts an end to a neighbourhood fallacy. This is one very moving and inspiring film and a great achievement for director Robert Mulligan (Up the Down Staircase, Love with a Proper Stranger).

For others it's Plan 9 From Outer Space. Whatever the case, there are many candidates for the worst movie ever made, but there can never be a definite answer to this question, due to how despite whatever the collective consensus may say about the film, there is always an opposing view. Sure there maybe many titles up for this dubious honour,but never one that all can agree on, except for what our own personal opinions may determine about the film as a whole. It is also why I feel that Natural Born Killers, despite its strong cult following and acclaim is to me the worst film ever made, and one everyone should avoid at all costs.The first major problem is the story. The plot is that a married couple, Mickey and Malorie Knox are on a murder spree, essentially killing everyone they meet. Meanwhile, the media reports on their actions, which potentially might be the bigger bad guys, glamorizing their rampage and giving them a lot of fans in the process. While it may sound very complex first, the plot is almost non-existent, as it consists of one murder to the next with little context to connect the scenes together and occasionally as clip about the media, just to trick you into thinking the film has more substance than it actually does. The only time any story comes into play is during the prison climax, but by then, it's too little too late. The non-linear storytelling also doesn't help, as it makes things needlessly complicated, and helps to make the film have less sense than it already did.The film also has a very bizarre, MTV-esque style, that may be unique and is used brilliantly here and there (mainly in a pharmacy shootout shot in green), but often makes it feel like you're on a very bad acid trip, and it gets very annoying, very quickly. It doesn't help that while the film shows off many stylistic choices (black and white cinematography, comic book sections, a sitcom homage), most don't work and feel random, making the film feel even more messy and poorly put together than it did previously. The dialogue also suffers because of this, consisting mainly of Tarantino-esque dripple that would even make E. L. James or Frank Miller feel dirty due to its pretentiousness. It doesn't help that the film has an absolutely woeful script, one that is so awful that you feel that the style is only there in order to mask many of the script's failings. The first problem is that NONE of the characters are likable. The main couple are a bunch of serial killers who despite their childhood abuse backstory aren't interesting, considering that they kill innocent people for pleasure. The supporting cast are equally as unsympathetic, whether it be Robert Downey Jr's reporter (who adopts an odd Austrilian accent to create an utterly irritating character) or the cop characters in the film, who either act in a sleazy or sadistic manner, and even the usually reliable Tommy Lee Jones acts like a Saturday morning cartoon villain in his role as police chief. The worst thing about the film is that it is a morally bankrupt venture, that has many poisonous messages laying under its skin. Not only does the film expect you to sympathize with a bunch of serial killers, but also makes that lifestyle seem inviting to many, due to how the killing gives the characters pleasure, they gain a strong fanbase and that they will be minimal consequences for your actions, especially considering that they are eventually freed from death row during a prison riot. It also doesn't help that all of the cops in the film are morally corrupt, as they are either perverts, sadists or want to cover things up, and killing them is a good thing (something highlighted when Downey's character says that he feels alive after killing one). These are alarming messages to be sending out, and while I'm often against the idea that fiction inspires real-life crime, this is sadly a case where the naysayers may actually have a point. Sure some may argue that the film is a satire of media glamorizing violence, but the movie is quite hypocritical here as well, as it is itself glamorizes the violence in the film and expects us to care for and worship the main characters, in the same way their fans do. It also doesn't have any sort of counterpoint to this either something which other controversial art (i.e. Fight Club, Manhunt, a lot of rap music) has. Because of this, it isn't surprising that the film has been linked to many real life crimes and tragedies, providing even more evidence to the film's questionable ideology.It is due to these attributes that I consider Natural Born Killers to be the worst movie ever made and one which has no redeeming value whatsoever. Whether it be the non-existent plot line, OTT style, unlikable characters, awful dialogue, hypocritical attempts at satire, dreadful acting and godawful politics that can corrupt many who see it, Natural Born Killers is a true stinker of a film that should be left to rot in the deepest, darkest hole you can find. I understand that back in the 90's, this may have seemed rebellious and exciting to the Generation X crowd, but considering that we aren't in the 90's anymore that we'd grow out of this and reevaluate this for being the absolute stinker that it is. Sadly, since it still has a strong fanbase, I can only assume that many believe that this is a brilliant movie that everyone should see. It isn't. Don't watch this evil movie, as not only is it a bad film, but the worst ever made and a truly reprehensible one at that. Truly shameful.

So begins a trial as we hear multiple interpretations from each individuals, the woodcutter, the deceased Samurai (Through a medium), the Samurai's wife and ultimately that of the bandit (The iconic Toshiro Mifune).Rashomon, outside its narrative has many appeals. It was the first Japanese film to make it big on the International circuit and coined the real life term The Rashomon Effect, where multiple individuals deliver conflicting information. The pacing throughout it's running length is stunning, and the way they used mirrors to reflect natural light really gives the picture untold depths of beauty. I think the acting on all fronts is pretty decent, but some of Machiko Kyō's performance as the Samurai's wife took me out of the seriousness of the situation.Final Verdict It's over 60 years old and even though I don't highly regard it as much as his other work, Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon still remains proudly influential. It's been analysed to death and some of those theories are downright absurd, but as our story suggests the true nature of actual events is lost among interpretation. 7\/10.

Robert Altman extremely admired this picture, his opinion is worth looking into). Whereas I enjoyed this movie overall, unfortunately I couldn't say I adored it as much as I have Kurosawa's later work (Or even earlier works I've yet to see them).In a day of particular heavy rain, a commoner takes shelter beneath a city gate with two other individuals. These two men are definitely fazed by a disturbing story that took place, where the woodcutter (The wonderful Takashi Shimura) tells that he found the body of a Samurai in the forest and went to alert the authorities. So begins a trial as we hear multiple interpretations from each individuals, the woodcutter, the deceased Samurai (Through a medium), the Samurai's wife and ultimately that of the bandit (The iconic Toshiro Mifune).Rashomon, outside its narrative has many appeals. It was the first Japanese film to make it big on the International circuit and coined the real life term The Rashomon Effect, where multiple individuals deliver conflicting information. The pacing throughout it's running length is stunning, and the way they used mirrors to reflect natural light really gives the picture untold depths of beauty.

In terms of story it cannot be more simple, a village of poor people are under the threat of looming bandits who plan to pillage everything within the next few days. Their only hope is dependent on the charitable services of fleeting Samurai, in hopes that they will accept rice as payment. Eventually through thick and thin an experienced Ronin (Takashi Shimura) aids the villagers plea and assembles five other Samurai, including a mischievous jester (Toshiro Mifune) who eventually proves his worth.Originally known as Six Samurai, Kurosawa and the screenwriters knew they needed another character more off the wall. Enter the iconic Toshiro Mifune, in his 7th appearance among the 16 productions he and Kurosawa shared. Largely improvised, his hapless and temperamental behaviour definitely stands out as the star of the show. The most expensive production at the time, the budget went overboard leading Toho Productions to shut it down twice. Kurosawa remained ever calm, convincing Toho to have faith and let him finish the picture. Though its length hinders the pacing ever slightly, Seven Samurai is gold in terms of big classic adventure drama. That wonderful Samurai march theme happily plays during innate and climactic scenes, and as always the weather plays a vital role in all of Kurosawa's movies, none more so than here in it's fantastic finale (Where Mifune would comment he'd never felt so cold in his life).Final Verdict The longest of Kurosawa's filmography, and definitely one of the very best.

Prisoners are assembled under a blazing sun and informed that they are being packed and sent for the rest of their lives to the penal colony at Devil's Island, French Guinea. France has disowned them. Among the prisoners is the titular character Papillon (aced by Steve McQueen) charged with a crime he hasn't committed, and Luis Dega (Hoffman), a fraud banker convicted on counterfeit charges. Bound by mutual necessity, they soon become friends during their journey to Devil's Island. Then begins a ruthless documentation of inhuman prison conditions in that infamous penal colony that has shamed French history forever. The movie is based on a book by the same name authored by Henri Charriere, a former convict and fugitive from Devil's Island and though the work is fiction, the background is entirely based on real events.As soon as Papillon declares his intention to flee this place to Dega, we are with him! And why not - the harrowing surrealism with which prison life at Devil's Island is depicted makes us grateful to afford our daily cup of coffee. Not surprising because the greatest prison movies have the power to nurture a sense of gratitude in us - that simply of being alive and free. Papillon is right up there with The Shawshank Redemption in that regard, and there are scenes toward the end of the movie where McQueen's character behaves as hysterical and looks almost identical to Tim Robbin's Andy Dufresne.However, the movie is also different from Shawshank in that it transcends the prison genre, occasionally yielding to levels of adventures expected in Indiana Jones or Monte Cristo. But the tension running through the movie is palpable; we find ourselves repeatedly cheering the poetic heroism of Papillon and his never-say-die attitude through the film; yet a part of us knows and feels the attempt is futile; that iron bars and grim walls of hard stone can break down any man's will; and even if you get past those obstacles through luck or friends, there is only a vast, endless ocean to conquer. Repeatedly we fail to offer him our trust, repeatedly he defies us by the strength of his being, till it all ends as a matter of choice in the brink of incertitude. Papillon finally finishes on a high note, with McQueen screaming Hey you bastards, I'm still here! This movie is also a great study of contrasting approaches to life. A life led by courage and a life led by cunning are not the same. Where Papillon always has his heart in the front, Dega the friend he earnestly trusts has his mind. There is a moment in the film where Papillon suffers much on account of a move by Dega, but he doesn't give his friend's name away to the officials. During such moments, we almost wish he were as practical as Dega, but we are reminded that a man of courage like Papillon can never be Dega. Nor can Dega ever be a Papillon. Yet, through the course of this movie, Dega transforms in his understanding of the heroic man and acknowledges that such men exist. In the breakdown of Dega's cynicism during the final hysterical scenes laced with black comedy and the gruff, raw editing that somehow suits and runs through the length of this movie; we know Papillon has triumphed and whether he live or die in the story, this movie will gloriously live on an island all its own!And inspire.

It's not hard to see why Goodfellas is such a critically acclaimed movie and still a very popular movie amongst film fans.Based on the non-fiction novel Wise Guy by Nicholas Pileggi (who also wrote the screenplay along with Martin Scorsese, Goodfellas tells the story of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta who puts in an explosive performance in his best role to date) and his rise and fall in his career with the mafia throughout the 1950's and the 1980's. He starts off as a young boy running errands and as time goes on, he earns his reputation as a feared gangster however such acts including adultery, murder, and drug use contribute to his downfall. His fellow friends and gangsters throughout his time in the mafia include his childhood friend the sociopath Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci who deservedly won the 1990 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor) and the slick, calculating and volatile Jimmy Conway who also enjoys hijacking and robbing trucks (Robert De Niro in another memorable performance). The mob boss is Paulie Cicero (Paul Sorvino), a man who commands respect and fear, and rules over the crime family with an iron first including Henry Hill, Tommy DeVito and Jimmy Conway. Henry Hill's wife Karen (Lorraine Bracco, well known as the psychologist Dr Jennifer Melfi from The Sopranos) finds herself seduced by her husband's glamorous lifestyle but nothing lasts forever when Henry's criminal activities and behaviour impede into their personal lives.Without question this is Martin Scorsese's finest movie. There's not one bad thing that can be said about this movie. The cast is first rate, the entire story and screenplay is excellent, and Martin Scorsese as the director does a very commendable job. Throughout the entire 146 minutes, there is not a dull moment nor is there a minute wasted. There are endless classic scenes in Goodfellas that I could not even start to list them. The clever use of the soundtrack with all the songs intertwined with many scenes from the movie makes Goodfellas even more memorable at another level. Every time I hear the piano exit from Layla by Derek and The Dominos, I am instantly reminded of Goodfellas.Goodfellas is a movie with a reputation for being violent with 300 uses of the f... word.

The violence is realistic, cold, and unflinching, and this is certainly not a movie for everyone.Unfortunately Goodfellas was unfairly robbed of many Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director among others.

The clever use of the soundtrack with all the songs intertwined with many scenes from the movie makes Goodfellas even more memorable at another level. Every time I hear the piano exit from Layla by Derek and The Dominos, I am instantly reminded of Goodfellas.Goodfellas is a movie with a reputation for being violent with 300 uses of the f... word. In no way does Martin Scorsese pull any punches, nor does he aim to glamorise life in the mafia or the criminal lifestyle. The violence is realistic, cold, and unflinching, and this is certainly not a movie for everyone.Unfortunately Goodfellas was unfairly robbed of many Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director among others. Though Martin Scorsese finally earns a long overdue Academy Award for The Departed in 2006, he deserved to win Best Director for Goodfellas.Goodfellas earns its spot as one of the finest movies of all time, and is definitely one of my favourite movies that will never soon be forgotten.A well deserved 10\/10 ","genre":"Biography, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"29 January 2015","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Three young boys, Rocky, Colt and Tum Tum together with their neighbour girl, computer whiz Amanda are visiting Mega Mountain amusement park when it is invaded by an army of ninjas led by evil Medusa, who wants to take over the park and hold the owners for ransom.

Although the war officially ended in 1865, the conflict in which it stirred would cause much pain and turmoil for many years after, especially for the defeated southern states. In the movie Gone with the Wind, a romanticized version of the old south is portrayed. Many scenes display vibrant colors and extravagant lifestyles led by the people of this civilization. The plot line follows a spoiled girl named Scarlett O'Hara and her struggles during and after the war. It shows how the south was stripped of all of the extravagance and laid to waste.As far as historical accuracy goes, the way the south was portrayed had some truth, but there were also aspects that might have been a little twisted. Throughout the movie, the people of the southern states are made out to be faultless and all of their afflictions were caused by the yankees of the north. When looking at history, the south was the main instigator of the war. It was only when states began seceding the north got involved, desperate to keep the nation from falling apart. Another aspect that was twisted is the attitude of the slaves towards their enslavement. All of the slaves in the movie seem content with their position. This attitude is obviously not historically accurate. Of course, there were some slaves that were not treated badly by their masters, but not once in the movie did a slave show animosity towards his\/her position.Despite some of these inaccuracies, some aspects of the movies did have historical significance. I felt the movie did a good job in conveying how the southerners were mistreated after the war. It was very interesting to get perspective from the characters while they were rebuilding their old home and getting their hands dirty for the first time in their lives. This was really how it was after the war was over. The southerners had everything taken from them, and many of their homes were burned to the ground. They had to start over and forge a new life from the ashes of their old civilization. I found this aspect to be true to history.Watching the movie without taking history into account, I found it to be quite enjoyable. The engaging storyline kept me watching for more, and I thoroughly enjoyed observing Scarlett's transformation in character as the events in her life callous her. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a strong female character, or a film with a deep plot line.
