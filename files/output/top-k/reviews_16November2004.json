Featuring a reclusive, abhorrent ogre as the protagonist is daring and unorthodox enough, yet also include the likes of an obnoxious, yet amicable chatterbox donkey (Eddie Murphy) as his unwanted sidekick, an ungrateful (and quite peculiar) princess as the subject of the heroic quest, and a lamentable, unintimidating midget named Lord Farquad as the villain, Shrek is not your typical innocent family fare, and it deserves high accolades for breaching the boundaries of what is traditionally accepted of the fantasy genre, and achieving an unconventional, dynamic, and truly amazing work of entertainment. To begin with, the title character Shrek is absolutely hilarious a low-brow, anti-social hideous creature who resides in a filthy swamp, consumes worms, and justifies his personality in descrying Ogres are like onions, because they have lairs. Just about every line that is uttered by this whimsical, yet loathsome, Shrek, is entirely laughable, and it is very difficult to actually take him seriously, even during frequent areas of sentimentality and self-reflection. Eddie Murphy provides his raw energy and vocalism in playing Shrek's opposite, the donkey, who is at times irksome with his incessant babblings, yet at times provides a welcome balance to Shrek's weaker parts. The screenplay is very engaging, extremely clever, and often hilarious. Besides the delightful dialogue between Shrek, Donkey, Princess Fiona, and Lord Farquad, there are some very daring and innovative pokes which deserve much commendation. The silliness of the gingerbread man pleading desperately not to pluck his gumdrop buttons is timeless! The Snow White mirror, mirror, what will it be? Princess 1, 2, or 3?--- how classically contemporary! And Shrek awaking Sleeping Beauty perfunctorily and unconventionally--- hilarious! There are some really imaginative qualities to be applauded here the animation settings are a mix between notorious fairy tale scenes, yet full of modern characters and dialogue that would appall anyone really living in those times! The cheerful, melodic music brilliantly collaborates with the mostly amusing, sometimes sentimental atmosphere of the film, and reminds us that every scene in the film plays a purpose to the story that is trying to be told. This is definitely one of the most enjoyable and satisfying animated films I have ever seen, is quite superior to its successor Shrek 2, and as a piece of entertainment, it works extremely effectively in achieving the humor, structure, character, catharsis, and meaning that is so often desired in movies, and is extremely rare as far as innocent animated fairy tales come.

I just knew I wouldn't like it. After all, I'm a girl and the subject of the film was football, my least favorite sport. What could I find enjoyable about the film? Plenty, it turned out. This was by far one of the best sports movies I have watched. Yes, a great deal of it focused on football, but it was about so much more than sports.The film centers on the 1971 football team (the Titans) at T.C. Williams High School in Alexandria, VA. The school system is working on integrating a previously all-white school, and the team is doing the same. For the first time, African American and white kids are supposed to play ball side by side, whether they like it or not. In the beginning, all of the players are angry at the situation and the team suffers because of it. As the story progresses, the two races eventually begin to accept each other and even begin to befriend kids of the opposite race. The movie focuses on the racism the players face from their peers and students from other schools and how the team deals with it. Of course there are a fair number of football scenes, but they add to the story rather than detract from it and shift the focus to sports. They help to show how all the individual players, regardless of their race, could come together as one to face a common opponent in whichever team they were playing. By the end of the film, the players realize that the color of their skin doesn't matter. They all face the same problems and have the same dreams.If you were to simply hear the film's premise, I don't think it would convince you to go see it. Sure, it deals with the serious problem of racism and has a lot of cool football scenes, but so what? On their own, the plots and sub-plots don't seem that special, but when combined with the superb acting skills of Denzel Washington, Will Patton, Ryan Hurst, Wood Harris and Hayden Panettiere, the film becomes a winner. Washington is great as Head Coach Boone, and Patton is equally amazing as Coach Yoast, but the film would only be tolerable without the performances of the guys on the football team. I would strongly recommend seeing this film just to enjoy their performances. They manage to portray the strong racial opposition in the beginning of the movie, and as the film progresses, the way they depict the team's relationship is remarkable. I found that as the movie went on, I became attached to many of the players and their struggles. By the end, I was rooting for all of them to overcome their individual obstacles. They all became real people to me, not simply characters in some film. Adding to the film's appeal was the great soundtrack. The songs played throughout the movie were a mix of Motown, gospel, and 70's rock. They gave the film a fun, relaxed feel and set the time of the film at the same time. If it is at all possible, please go out and see this film. It doesn't matter how old you are. People of any age can enjoy it. The story is interesting, it doesn't get too serious and the acting is top notch. I would give this film a 9 out of 10.

I saw the film before I read the book, and I must say I liked the film better. Stephen Kings books usually have the same why behind the what, and Christine was no different. However, John Carpenter took all of the why element found in the book out and made it a love story between a nerdy teen Arnie Cunningham(Keith Gordon) and a run down car named Christine, which I believe added some substance and improved the story in ways King never imagined. Watching Arnie's transition from nerd to almost greaser is a tense and creepy process, with a huge nod going to Gordon. Carpenter makes the atmosphere with his directing, and the mood is always somber with one of my Favorite Carpenter Scores. While movies like The Breakfast Club and Sixteen Candles were showing one side of the coin, Christine showed the other. What most look at as a killer car movie is really much deeper and in my opinion the subtext shows a side of the teen years that most would be more likely to remember. This is a under-rated movie that shows more about isolation and life in high school than anything that happened in Shermer, Illinois.Check it out!

The characters are all well drawn, both Allies and Nazis, and each has a distinct personality, though McQueen's stands out. Even though only a few escape this is still a story of hope to rival The Shawshank Redemption. Memorable scenes are obvious Steve's biking, Pleasance's tragic end, the celebrations which end in death, the 'get out and stretch your legs' scene, and the train station scene. With beautiful cinematography and a rousing score, this is a favourite for many people-it's shown here every Christmas. Interesting in that this is one of the few films i can think of which has no female character of note. 9 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"16 November 2004","score":"12 out of 16 people found the following review useful","review":" POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!Exciting, funny, tragic, with a massive cast who all perform brilliantly, providing many memorable moments, The Great Escape as everyone knows tells the story of the attempted escape of allied troops from German imprisonment.

It surprises as an accomplished and authentic-feeling example of Southern Gothic, better than 'Deliverance,' but nowhere near as good as 'Night of the Hunter,' and also as a morality play with a streak of dark irony.Lean at 86 minutes, the film's build-up is exquisite. Lance Henriksen, excellent here as a highly physical, laconic grocery store owner in rural Rural, U.S.A, lives alone with his son, who is his sole companion after the death of his wife. The movie carefully and quite skillfully establishes the importance of this boy to his father, and this gives almost unbearable gravity to the boy's accidental death at the hands of six urban motorcycling youths. The movie's handling of this situation is brilliant and completely devoid of cheapness or exploitativeness, and the underrated Henriksen reveals himself as an actor of depth and significance.There is moral and material conflict among the youths, who retreat to their cabin. One of them, a violent and dominating thug, is on probation for DUI, and taking responsibility for the boy's death would likely yield a prison sentence. Meanwhile, Henriksen consults an old witch to unleash the titular demon, one who's only been rumored about in campfire tales and bedtime stories, to avenge his child's death, and subsequently undergoes moral turnaround himself.The last third of the film lacks weight or interest, as the demon dispatches each youth against the sudden protests of Henriksen. It's almost as though the director, Stan Winston, wanted to avoid hunt-and-slay elements altogether, and went through the motions as quickly as possible. While this is admirable, this portion of the film almost completely lacks flair.It's forgivable, though. Not many horror films are as good as this, which is concise, atmospheric, and manages to provoke both thought and genuine emotion, with wonderful supporting players like Joseph Piro and Buck Flower that augment the film's rural ambiance with an enchanting authenticity.
