There are really a few things that he gets really right, amid the obvious camp that comes with a movie like this. He uses some tough, interesting B-actresses for the parts of the Debs-turned-Jezebelles, with Robbie Lee and Joanne Nail and Monica Gayle as the main three ladies of the bunch all turning in cool, un-restrained performances (one thing they don't lack, aside from some sex appeal, is spunk).Another thing that makes the film really work is that, more often than not (which was also the case with Hill's Pam Grier pictures) is that it's very, very funny. Sometimes it was just by some unexpected stuff (the guy in the elevator early in the film, or stuff during the climactic battle in the streets), or just by some of the creative dialog. But really what helped make the film work for me was that it had a great marriage of 'exploitation' ideals (just look at the prison scenes) with spots of realism, or at least things that seem realistic in the Roger Corman school of writing.These may be larger-than-life character, but that's part of the fun in it, that it's an action fantasy where we can root for the rough, take-no-prisoners gals of action, who also aren't completely in-human. Hill, who has mentioned in interviews how part of his film-making comes from being a musician, knows the rhythms of scenes and dialog (as stupid as it can get at times), and even has a little style to show off amid the patently 70's times.

There is something about this effort that kills off the insomniac in me. When I first saw this movie in 1969, just before the first moon landing, people were actually holding conversations in the cinema as the film was playing, and I was more interested in what they were saying than I was in the plot! An irate, highbrow friend informed me I was not ready for this futuristic essay, along with just about everyone in the movie theater! At that time this movie had received monster reviews from just about every film critic on Earth, but apart from my learn-ed friend, no one else seemed to think much of this film! In around 2002 my son, who is an avid Kubrick fan, good for him, bought this DVD and states it is the best that Kubrick ever made! I tried to watch it with him and fell asleep before the halfway stage. He kept prodding me awake to explain what he thought was going on. I knew what was going on, but it's just fiction and by definition should be entertaining, not nodding material! I know that most of the audiences are just people who make up the silent majority so I don't expect any kudos from these truths.

Mostly everybody I knew or encountered had nothing but positive things to say about this film. So in January 2005, I finally decided to give this movie a chance. My assumptions were right; I ended up not liking the movie.There are many problems with this movie. For one, the acting. The acting was pretty terrible in this film. Most of the actors and actresses in this film looked like they just rehearsed their lines one time in the mirror before they began shooting this monster(and I don't mean in a good way) of a film. Lord of the Rings did not really have any characters I felt sorry for nor cared about. Can somebody please explain to me why the heck Sir Ian McKellan got an Oscar nomination for this schlok of a film? How he got nominated still puzzles me to this day.Now I know I will be crucified for saying this but I don't care. The plot, when I think about it, wasn't all that great. Basically from what I gather about this plot is that it is about a young hobbit that embarks on an epic quest to destroy a ring. Wow, how interesting is that(sarcastic)! I think another reason why I didn't like this movie is because it's a fantasy film and I hate fantasy movies.

Unlike his best work, this isn't thrilling and the plot isn't set up well.

A friend of his offers to hide him, while she sinks her teeth into a bit of amateur detective work. However, she ends up falling in love with the detective on the case...Many rate this film for it's character lead story; but this is actually a bad point; as it's hard for a character drama, much less one that is supposed to thrill, to succeed when the characters are so poorly drawn. The plot isn't interesting either, as we follow what is basically (in terms of Hitchcock films) a run of the mill murder, without much to distance it from many, many other films of the same ilk.

If this was a film by almost any other director, then I probably wouldn't be so hard on it; but there's a certain expectation that comes with films from the great Alfred Hitchcock and this one doesn't even come close to meeting them.

Once he recovers, this stranger (Matt Damon) is stunned to realize he can speak five or six languages fluently, but doesn't remember where he learned them, or anything that happened prior to his awakening for that matter. The only clue he has is a bank account number in Switzerland, which reveals his name is Jason Bourne and he 's involved in some kind of classified activity. Unfortunately he doesn't have much time to sort things out, as his superiors (Chris Cooper and Brian Cox) think he has deserted and decide to take him down. With only a German student named Marie (Franka Potente) willing to help him, Bourne must put all the pieces together and find out exactly who he is before it is too late. Director Doug Liman and screenwriter Tony Gilroy have made their own version of The Bourne Identity (Robert Ludlum's novel is almost completely different), but who cares, as long as the movie works? It's one of the best spy stories ever made, and it looks like something that could actually happen (all of Bourne's weapons can be purchased by an average citizen). This is the anti-Bond, a man who actually gets hurt and would rather be left alone, and his vulnerability is grippingly conveyed through Damon's powerful performance. If there is a defect, it has to be the fact that the film's focus is almost entirely on the protagonist, overshadowing a fine supporting cast (especially Cooper and Clive Owen, whose turn as the Professor manages to be much more than a stereotyped silent killer pantomime).Probably the most interesting action movie of 2002, with an even better sequel continuing in the same direction.

Then try The Bourne Identity, which brings new life to the genre. It's got everything you're after intelligent story, believable and likable characters, and yes, action too, but it's realistic action, not some Matrix-style kicking.The most intriguing aspect is arguably that the hero is a vulnerable human being. In fact, at the beginning of the movie he is found half-dead in the French sea. Once he recovers, this stranger (Matt Damon) is stunned to realize he can speak five or six languages fluently, but doesn't remember where he learned them, or anything that happened prior to his awakening for that matter. The only clue he has is a bank account number in Switzerland, which reveals his name is Jason Bourne and he 's involved in some kind of classified activity. Unfortunately he doesn't have much time to sort things out, as his superiors (Chris Cooper and Brian Cox) think he has deserted and decide to take him down. With only a German student named Marie (Franka Potente) willing to help him, Bourne must put all the pieces together and find out exactly who he is before it is too late. Director Doug Liman and screenwriter Tony Gilroy have made their own version of The Bourne Identity (Robert Ludlum's novel is almost completely different), but who cares, as long as the movie works? It's one of the best spy stories ever made, and it looks like something that could actually happen (all of Bourne's weapons can be purchased by an average citizen).

This added to the comedy aspect and caused hilarious scenes. In addition it added depth to the characters themselves, which is something comedies of this sort normally lack. To put this into the right perspective, some of the thoughts we are presented with are rather artificial, but still, the approach itself and its effect on the storyline is something that needs to be appreciated.The plot is modest, but has some unexpected strengths. I was frankly surprised about the mix of realistic challenges of life and the comedy aspects, as I thought the latter would be the movie's emphases. However, they were in balance - the movie dealt with real problems many members of the audience are probably able to relate to. The comedy was sometimes too artificial, but it seems to have worked in this case.Hugh Grant and his attitude towards life is one major theme, Nicholas Hoult's portrayal of Marcus the second prevailing one. The movie then focuses on these two characters and makes them influence each other - which leads to interesting changes and challenges for the protagonists, and that is what puts this movie above the ordinary.I generally do not like Hugh Grant's humor. Here again he seems a bit uncomfortable as Nicholas' partner. He kind of aces his comedy parts with his very own sense of entertaining the audience, but as soon as it comes to difficult scenes demanding more than superficial acting, he seems - yeah, a bit uneasy.Nonetheless, considering the general lack of sophistication comedies such as these aim at, this movie is an improvement. The father-son relationship which is subtly addressed lacks real emotional depth - again something which accrues from the movie's arrangement as a comedy - but is decent to watch and carries some messages.I personally like Hugh Grant's philosophy of life - something many male singles will be able to relate to somehow - and the way he justifies his attitude. The changes which happen after he has encountered Marcus make this movie worthwhile, as they entail a character development and some messages of life.'No man is an island' - Marcus' last words and his face as the closing scene made me appreciate this movie as a whole, because it really made its way off the corny trash and has managed to mix comedy with sincere issues of life - something hard to find.

Instead of a warning, Newman's son kills the mobster. Hanks' son becomes a witness, and the rules dictate that Hanks' family be eliminated. They are, except for the stowaway who is now on the run with Hanks.As a amateur hit man, this is what I would have done.I would have placed my son under the seat from whence he emerged, walked back into the crime scene with Newman's son, while in soothing tones explaining how everything could be smoothed over. When close to the dead mobster, I would have shot Newman's son, placed a gun in the mobster's hand, drove back to Paul and pleaded,  Sorry sir, it just happened so fast I couldn't stop it I would have saved my family, and placed only myself in jeopardy. If Newman shot me, the movie might have ended prematurely.The cadaverous photographer placed on Hank's tail got a contrived Plot point break when Hanks failed to kill him when he was wounded behind a sofa. This allowed Hanks to get wounded, recovered at the home of a caring older couple, and to an ending that was sadly predictable.
