I don't think this film knew what it wanted to be.  It was part period piece, part sword-fighting, part love story.  Oh the agony of watching that love story develop.  Ugh.  At points in this film, the crowd was dropping belly laughs and it wasn't because of the lines being cute and funny.  The interaction with the characters was SO bad, this movie seemed to me like a spoof on period pieces more than anything else.

Do yourself a favor, rent Swashbuckler, rent the original 3 Musketeers and 4 Musketeers, heck rent Robin Hood Prince of Thieves (you'll hear more of an accent from Kevin Costner than you will from Mina Suvari) if you must, but avoid this movie like it is the plague.

The Krendler character conveniently isolates himself at his home for the infamous dinner scene.   Hannibal has it too easy trying to escape.   If he is still wanted by the FBI,  shouldn't they be more hot and bothered when he turns up on a surveillance video,  such as keeping an eye out for him at the airports?  He cuts off his hand at the end of the film,  and then without incident boards an airplane.  With the law enforcement on his tail,  wouldn't they send an APB to all airports to look out for an old guy missing a hand?  Then there are the gore scenes.

That means unsuspecting parents that took their children to this R rated movie,  subjected their kids to scenes of very graphic and disturbing images.   An ambiguous R rating also deceives general adult audiences who are used to a level of violence the rating normally represents.   An NC-17 serves as a special warning to all moviegoers that the violence is much more intense.   It doesn't matter that,  yeah,  this was all special effects and not real.  Even one of the special effects people involved with the movie, mentions on the DVD that he himself was very disturbed by the image of a person with his entire brain exposed and still conscious,  eating a piece of his own brain.  I myself can vividly recall this image several days after seeing it.  To allow this film to be released without an NC-17 rating is negligence in part by the studio and the ratings board.  I am not easily squeamish,  and as I said before,  I enjoyed the campy fun of gore flicks.  But this is a mainstream film,  obviously aware of the large built-in audience,  showing insensitivity in deciding to show these images.

With the law enforcement on his tail,  wouldn't they send an APB to all airports to look out for an old guy missing a hand?  Then there are the gore scenes.  I grew up enjoying flicks like `Dawn of the Dead',  `Day of the Dead',  etc.  These films would have easily been given an NC-17 rating if it existed at the time.  `Hannibal' was given an R rating.  That means unsuspecting parents that took their children to this R rated movie,  subjected their kids to scenes of very graphic and disturbing images.   An ambiguous R rating also deceives general adult audiences who are used to a level of violence the rating normally represents.   An NC-17 serves as a special warning to all moviegoers that the violence is much more intense.   It doesn't matter that,  yeah,  this was all special effects and not real.  Even one of the special effects people involved with the movie, mentions on the DVD that he himself was very disturbed by the image of a person with his entire brain exposed and still conscious,  eating a piece of his own brain.  I myself can vividly recall this image several days after seeing it.  To allow this film to be released without an NC-17 rating is negligence in part by the studio and the ratings board.  I am not easily squeamish,  and as I said before,  I enjoyed the campy fun of gore flicks.  But this is a mainstream film,  obviously aware of the large built-in audience,  showing insensitivity in deciding to show these images.   I made the decision a long time ago that I have no interest in seeing any of the `Faces of Death' videos,  because I wish to not have these awful images existing in my head.

The problem is, he isn't charming, but he is devious -- but not in a deliciously wicked kind of way. Watching him I feel disgusted -- I want the hero of the film to run away, or to report this character to the cops. But this doesn't happen -- for reasons I'll state soon enough.What happens, though, is that the tennis player (who as a celebrity, tries to play friendly with the common folk), makes the mistake of allowing the stranger (who is very obsessed with him), to become too friendly. But he isn't just obsessed by his status as a player, he's also got the athlete's personal life down pack. You see. He knows he's getting a divorce. And the lighter the athlete carries around, which contains him and his wife's first name initials -- the stranger knows what the initials stand for. And I wouldn't cancel out the possibility that he knows the size of his tennis shoes, and where he bought them.The tennis player finds himself in a bit of a pickle, when he sarcastically agrees to the stranger's proposition, that the stranger kill the tennis player's wife, and that the tennis player kill the stranger's father -- `criss-cross,' the stranger calls it. But sarcasm is something the stranger did not pick-up. Oh no. For a night later, he strangles the Tennis player's wife to death at a carnival.Now, one may think, that once the tennis player receives news of this occurrence, he'll simply call the cops and quickly kick the stranger out of his life, for good. But there's a problem. The tennis player is an accessory to murder. The stranger asks, `Why would I kill a stranger?' Good point. It would seem plausible for a man to kill a woman who denies that they separate. So what must the tennis player do, in order to avoid imprisonment? Even I, who feel negative about the film, will not spoil.But speaking of irony. I often watched certain passages of this film, through the eyes of those who've loved it, and I see a film that isn't so bad after all. That's clearly the wrong way to watch any movie. Then I watch the film through my 18 year old eyes, and see mediocrity.I suppose, that for diehard Hitchcock fans, they see a personal work, which asks the question `Would I ever kill someone?' and `how would I go about doing it?' This is obviously a question the filmmaker has posed one-time or the other, and I'd be lying if I said that I didn't.But what makes the movie Titanic for me, is that the screenwriter didn't use a more practical. universal situation that would bring up such a question, for every person who watched it -- or anyone like me.Movies, I know, are all about trips to fantasy worlds, nightmares, and more practical locations. And there are movies that have gone the nightmarish, fantasy and pratical route, and I've loved them. But this movie. This one didn't quite move me enough.For quite a long time, I've been watching a few `classics,' and found that the only `classic' thing about them were their age. Either that, or I'd deny my state-of-mind at the moment, just because I'm not enjoying it as much as every other critic is. But my state of mind is just fine. This film, I'm sorry to say, is very overrated.

The only reason I gave it three points in my vote rather than only one is a) the dinosaurs, they're really great, especially the fight scene between dinosaur and dinosaur (no spoilers here...) and b) I've had a really great time watching it, making fun of it, laughing at it, and tearing it apart with my best friend. I mean, I laughed more in that movie than I did in Germany's comedy production of the year. The plot is non-existent, the dialogue defies description (what would you talk about in life-threatening situations? Yep, losing weight and the weather) and they could not have done a worse job fitting the action scenes together to form a movie. In addition, the ever-so-popular American family values are emphasized to the point of absurdity (My son! I love you! Oh, big carnivorous beast standing in the background- no matter! My SON!!)The predictability of this movie starts with the opening credits where my friend and I just sat grinning at each other, anticipating the claw that would make the III. I loved Jurassic Park and boykotted The Lost World because I was convinced any sequels would ruin the first one. I watched this third one for fun (I swear, whenever I wasn't clawing at the seat or looking away because the eating scenes seem to be getting progressively gorier to make up for progressively bad plot, I was laughing my head off). Now I finally did watch Lost World, and while it was not as good as the first one, compared to this third one it's a cinematic masterpiece. And finally, before I go on to individual scenes, I have to say everything in this movie seems to be recycled from the prequels. Their flight over the island (even the music is the same!), their entering the building, overgrown with vines, the river raft scene is from JP1's novel, as is the pterodactyl scene, and so on and so on...they even stole something from Lord of the Flies. And I hear that after JP3's success, JP4 is already a sure thing.

In my opinion, John Travolta deserved at least a nomination for an Oscar here, if not the award itself. The story was decent, but the performances of Travolta, Forest Whitaker, Robert Duvall, and Kyra Sedgwick made me care about what was happening on the screen. By no means is this a romantic comedy. It's romantic, probably the most romantic film I have seen in a long time. The reason for that is simple...it's real. In most movies you see the main characters sleep together within a day at the most, which rarely happens with two people who are really in love. True love has to take time and effort, which is exactly what you see here. Travolta's George is patient, but not because he wants to be. If you're a romantic at heart you will understand and relate to him, and you will hope for his success as you would for your own. Without giving anything away, I will tell you that the ending is sad, but also heartwarming. George has his experience for no other reason than to suggest what we as humans can become. Phenomenon is a story about our potential, the good and bad things that can happen to us if we achieve it. We could only be so lucky, and watching the movie is a good start. I give it 8 out of 10 stars.

The kind of humor portrayed in this movie is under the exact category that I love. I never knew that such a semi-serious actor like Jeff Daniels could be so stupid, and it amazed me on how well he played the part. This movie is so ridiculously unintelligent and unrealistic, but that is exactly what makes it so hilarious. I laughed more during this movie than I usually laugh in a month. My side hurt terribly at the end and I couldn't get it to stop.One of the scenes that really got my attention was quite possibly the stupidest scene of the film, at that would be the resteraunt scene that Lloyd imagines. This particular scene (along with the ones that followed) was so stupid that it made me feel like I didn't know why I was watching this trash, but it was amazingly funny. Another scene that grabs me is the burger\/pepper scene, particularly at the end when Lloyd uses the phrase check, please (that line was so perfectly placed that I still laugh when I think about it).This movie amused me more than any other movie. It is literally the most hilarious film I have ever seen, but I wouldn't recommend it to the easily offended type.
