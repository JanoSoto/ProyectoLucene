Only in recent years, after a decade of rumors of missing footage & production problems, has a more complete Assembly Cut given audiences a closer look at what the film originally would have been.Alien 3 was the first film by David Fincher, whom brought his own personal style to the series.

While the script should have been given additional drafts & the film itself has several plot holes when viewed against the previous films, none-the-less Alien 3 delivers the scares and terror of the original film. The music is extraordinary, though at times is washed out due to the screams and sound FX. Audiences may have trouble identifying certain characters, as many look similar, and most names are hardly used. While the film may drag out at points, the suspense soon picks us, giving us a modern-day (or futuristic) ghost-house type of story similar in style to the original film, leading to a heart-racing final climax.Sigourney Weaver delivers a great performance of a woman trapped with little options, who has evolved from a common woman in Alien to now a woman with little to lose; willing to directly combat the creature. There are plenty of plot twists in the film, and for fans of the previous two films, the ending is emotional.As for the Alien itself... Without giving away spoilers, the Alien effects and in terms of how it acts and moves is cranked up a notch; the bar is raised in terms of viciousness and speed.As part of the two-disk set for the Assembly Cut, there are also extensive features that detail previous story ideas, including the popular wooden planet concept, and for the first time delves into the production problems that caused David Fincher to walk off the project and give up the film to the producers.After viewing both the Theatrical and Assembly Cuts, as well as the extensive making-of features, I personally give the film an 8 out of 10.

Once it disappeared from TV screens, it awakened the spirits of fans all over the world. Paramount had no idea that such a huge fanbase existed for the series, and wasted no time in putting the show back on the air through re-runs and syndication. It eventually grew out into the cultural phenomenon it is today.But the fans weren't completely satisfied with just having repeats to enjoy. They wanted Star Trek back. They wanted whole new adventures. With Star Wars developing its own SF phenomenon in the late 70s, Gene Roddenberry shrewdly decided now was the time to bring Star Trek back. To the big screen.But Star Trek The Motion Picture opened to indifferent response. Despite what many people would have you believe, the film was not a box-office flop. It recouped handsomely on its investment. It was just seen as a profound disappointment to the legions of fans who had held a candle for the series all these years. Many people felt the group ensemble had become swallowed up by the Hollywood movie machine. And it started off the whole belief that even numbered Trek films are bad, while the odd numbered sagas are good.But I'm going to go out on a limb here, and say that Star Trek The Motion Picture is a damn good film. In fact its a film that deserves more respect than it gets. Many of the future Trek spin-offs owe a lot to this film. Because without it, its doubtful there would have been a Star Trek The Next Generation (interestingly the theme music for the show originated in this movie) at all. And it has some of the most breathtaking special effects you're ever likely to see in a Star Trek film.A gigantic space cloud is on a course to Earth. Its already destroyed three Klingon Attack Cruisers, and Starfleet may very well be next. The Enterprise is in drydock, and the only vessel within range that can intercept the cloud. Now Admiral Kirk (William Shatner) uses the crisis as an opportunity to retake command of the upgraded Enterprise, and takes the ship on a wondrous journey through the deepest recesses of the mysterious cloud to discover its intent.I think Star Trek The Motion Picture is a sadly unappreciated film. At its core is the very ideal that Star Trek stands for. Exploring new frontiers. Pushing back all the boundaries. Boldly going where no one has gone before. All of the other Star Trek films have sadly avoided the exploration of the unknown. Pt 1 is the only film in the series that made a conscious decision to map out and expand upon the idea of space exploration in the show, while the others put the cast at the mercies of some extremely variable plot lines.A lot of people have criticised the film's almost snail-like pace. But the best type of SF starts slowly, and allows it to build a sense of grandeur. Films like Alien, and especially 2001 A Space Odyssey. In fact as I watched the film, I was reminded of the time I saw 2001 for the first time. The same sense of wonder. Of something transcendent and immense. Few SF films have touched upon the profundity of space and time like 2001 did. But Star Trek The Motion Picture is one of the few that can join the club.The way the mystery slowly unfolds is conducted quite beautifully. As the Enterprise penetrates deeper and deeper into the cloud, you become quite enthralled. And awed. Paramount allegedly lavished a 47 million dollar budget on the film, and it shows. The special effects sequences are absolutely dazzling. The cloud's interior resembles a vast kaleidoscope of colour, textures and lighting. There is so much to see in every corner of the screen. No matter how many times you watch the film, you will notice something different.There were times though that I felt the effects technicians were using every opportunity to show off. The outside tour of the Enterprise is a bit longer than it needs to be. The wormhole sequence could have been edited out altogether, and the Enterprise's journey through the cloud sometimes felt like a guided tour of Universal Studios. But contrary to popular belief, I felt the cast weren't overshadowed by the effects. Unlike most film\/TV crossovers, Star Trek opens up onto the big screen with tremendous confidence.As usual, Chekov, Sulu and Uhura only fill out the background while Kirk, Spock, McCoy and Scotty take the stage. But that doesn't hurt the film as much as you might think. Spock in particular gets a hefty dilemma to tackle. Trying to purge himself of all emotion, he finds himself drawn to this vast entity. A creature of pure logic and no feeling. Sensing a kinship, he comes to share some of his own experiences with it, and the two are all the better for it. Watching Spock shed a tear is subtle, understated and very powerful.The film's finale could seem an anticlimax, especially after the protracted buildup. A NASA satellite evolved into a new lifeform trying to make contact with its long dead creator. There is something amusing about such a vastly powerful entity capable of storing entire star systems within itself, yet it can't even scrape the dirt off of its own nameplate. But I still think Star Trek The Motion Picture is an underrated effort. It has much to recommend. The theme by the late Jerry Goldsmith is haunting, eerie and uplifting at all of the right moments. Its a dazzling visual experience. Quite thought-provoking. And so much better than all the negative publicity would have you believe.

And it has some of the most breathtaking special effects you're ever likely to see in a Star Trek film.A gigantic space cloud is on a course to Earth. Its already destroyed three Klingon Attack Cruisers, and Starfleet may very well be next. The Enterprise is in drydock, and the only vessel within range that can intercept the cloud. Now Admiral Kirk (William Shatner) uses the crisis as an opportunity to retake command of the upgraded Enterprise, and takes the ship on a wondrous journey through the deepest recesses of the mysterious cloud to discover its intent.I think Star Trek The Motion Picture is a sadly unappreciated film. At its core is the very ideal that Star Trek stands for. Exploring new frontiers. Pushing back all the boundaries. Boldly going where no one has gone before. All of the other Star Trek films have sadly avoided the exploration of the unknown. Pt 1 is the only film in the series that made a conscious decision to map out and expand upon the idea of space exploration in the show, while the others put the cast at the mercies of some extremely variable plot lines.A lot of people have criticised the film's almost snail-like pace. But the best type of SF starts slowly, and allows it to build a sense of grandeur. Films like Alien, and especially 2001 A Space Odyssey. In fact as I watched the film, I was reminded of the time I saw 2001 for the first time. The same sense of wonder. Of something transcendent and immense. Few SF films have touched upon the profundity of space and time like 2001 did. But Star Trek The Motion Picture is one of the few that can join the club.The way the mystery slowly unfolds is conducted quite beautifully. As the Enterprise penetrates deeper and deeper into the cloud, you become quite enthralled. And awed. Paramount allegedly lavished a 47 million dollar budget on the film, and it shows. The special effects sequences are absolutely dazzling. The cloud's interior resembles a vast kaleidoscope of colour, textures and lighting. There is so much to see in every corner of the screen. No matter how many times you watch the film, you will notice something different.There were times though that I felt the effects technicians were using every opportunity to show off. The outside tour of the Enterprise is a bit longer than it needs to be. The wormhole sequence could have been edited out altogether, and the Enterprise's journey through the cloud sometimes felt like a guided tour of Universal Studios. But contrary to popular belief, I felt the cast weren't overshadowed by the effects. Unlike most film\/TV crossovers, Star Trek opens up onto the big screen with tremendous confidence.As usual, Chekov, Sulu and Uhura only fill out the background while Kirk, Spock, McCoy and Scotty take the stage. But that doesn't hurt the film as much as you might think. Spock in particular gets a hefty dilemma to tackle. Trying to purge himself of all emotion, he finds himself drawn to this vast entity. A creature of pure logic and no feeling. Sensing a kinship, he comes to share some of his own experiences with it, and the two are all the better for it. Watching Spock shed a tear is subtle, understated and very powerful.The film's finale could seem an anticlimax, especially after the protracted buildup. A NASA satellite evolved into a new lifeform trying to make contact with its long dead creator. There is something amusing about such a vastly powerful entity capable of storing entire star systems within itself, yet it can't even scrape the dirt off of its own nameplate. But I still think Star Trek The Motion Picture is an underrated effort. It has much to recommend. The theme by the late Jerry Goldsmith is haunting, eerie and uplifting at all of the right moments. Its a dazzling visual experience. Quite thought-provoking. And so much better than all the negative publicity would have you believe.

Once it disappeared from TV screens, it awakened the spirits of fans all over the world. Paramount had no idea that such a huge fanbase existed for the series, and wasted no time in putting the show back on the air through re-runs and syndication. It eventually grew out into the cultural phenomenon it is today.But the fans weren't completely satisfied with just having repeats to enjoy. They wanted Star Trek back. They wanted whole new adventures. With Star Wars developing its own SF phenomenon in the late 70s, Gene Roddenberry shrewdly decided now was the time to bring Star Trek back. To the big screen.But Star Trek The Motion Picture opened to indifferent response. Despite what many people would have you believe, the film was not a box-office flop. It recouped handsomely on its investment. It was just seen as a profound disappointment to the legions of fans who had held a candle for the series all these years. Many people felt the group ensemble had become swallowed up by the Hollywood movie machine. And it started off the whole belief that even numbered Trek films are bad, while the odd numbered sagas are good.But I'm going to go out on a limb here, and say that Star Trek The Motion Picture is a damn good film. In fact its a film that deserves more respect than it gets. Many of the future Trek spin-offs owe a lot to this film.

This is actually a story about a young woman (Kelly Preston) from America and an immigrant from France (Tcheky Karyo) who meet in New York and fall in love. Preston, raised in a small town, finally spreads her wings and flies away to the big city in pursuit of her dreams. There she meets Karyo, the man of her dreams, who loves America where he has come to achieve his dreams. Sadly the two of them are dogged by their sicko, stalking ex-lovers who conspire to wreak mayhem upon them and turn their dreams into a nightmare.Broderick and Ryan commit heinous crimes, including invasion of privacy (on multiple levels), stalking, and breaking and entering. They are seriously disturbed voyeurs who generate no chemistry and no sympathy. I was touched only by the steady, true love of Preston and Karyo which even overcomes the sinister machinations of Broderick and Ryan. The film attempts to get the audience to identify with the sickos, instead of the true protagonists of this film. Unfortunately, their characters provide no chemistry and nothing with which I could identify.

Meg Ryan and Matthew Broderick never come close to portraying 3-dimensional characters - much less, likable ones - or achieving any on-screen chemistry. This is a pitiful excuse for a romance or a comedy or a romantic comedy.Tragically, this film is about two people from disparate backgrounds who, against all odds meet, fall in love and build a dream life only to have it devastated by two contemptuous criminals from their past.

As a result, it can viewed as either a metaphor or a microcosm of society, with a cynical and satirical comment on the then contemporary ideas of a civilization with no rules and limitations - a forced utopia if you will - and the inevitable escalation of violence, corruption and contempt that could only ever thrive in such a characteristically free environment. Although these ideas and interpretations do lend a certain sense of context to the images and themes presented herein, the eventual intent of Even Dwarfs Started Small is to present a story on the most simple and visual of levels; creating an escalating sense of emotion that moves wildly from moments of humour to horror until, finally, reaching a fever-pitch level, wherein all the notions blur together into one.Herzog would probably reject any interpretation other than the literal one of dwarfs rebelling against authority, but then again, Herzog's word isn't intended to be taken as gospel. The natural contradictions of the set-up here, in which the fight of the characters to free themselves from what they see as a corrupt and abusive society, ultimately giving way to something that is even more oppressive, is an intelligent one; something that you could interpret on a political level, or in fact, as a wider-reaching comment about the position of the outsider within society. Likewise, the casting of the dwarfs' works on a number of other, more interesting levels, most obviously in the creation of a world that we must carefully re-adjust to and learn to experience from a completely different perspective. The buildings, cars, furniture, trees and animals remain the same as how we would experience them on a day-to-day basis, but thrown into this veritable mix we have characters that are literally dwarfed - overwhelmed even - by the world around them, creating a further rift that propels these notions of revolution and defiance.In a world in which even climbing onto a bed or reaching up to pull the door handle becomes a accomplishment as epic in scope as that of Herzog's ultimate personification of single-minded determination and intensity, Fitzcarraldo (1982), the plight of the dwarfs in this film takes on a greater meaning, as the film begins with something of a moral victory that simply cannot be sustained given the heightened sense of reality that the film exists in. We're never entirely sure as to what triggers the revolt, or why there is only one dwarf left in charge of the compound, barricaded in his office with one of the other dwarfs tied to a chair as a hostage, or indeed, what purposes this compound fulfilled in its previously active form. This persistent abstraction of the background details of the story forces us to focus more closely on the relationship between the larger group unit, and the slow spiral of dysfunction and destruction that escalates from one scene to the next. If you attempt to approach the film on any such level of story and character, you might possibly be disappointed or even offended by Herzog's stark presentation. Instead, the real point of the film is in the atmosphere that it creates, and in the feelings that it forms as we watch these enigmatic and often provocative images unfold.If you're familiar with Herzog and his work, you'll be able to appreciate this style from films such as Aguirre, Wrath of God (1972) or Heart of Glass (1976), with the continual juxtaposition between moments of abstracted realism and bizarre, fever-dream hallucinations that seem to exist within the story free of context. This continual contrast adds to the dreamlike, or indeed, nightmarish aspect of the film, which recalls elements of Todd Browning's difficult masterpiece Freaks (1932); and not simply on the more obvious, superficial level, but in the way in which the film gets darker and darker as it progresses towards a violent and memorable final. Though a brief description of some of the scenes and situations presented in the film might fail to shock an audience, viewers should be advised that the incredibly heightened sense of tension and the abstract surrealism created by the use of cinematography, editing, location and music lends the film a suffocating air in which the destruction of personal property, plant life and animals becomes hypnotic, frightening and entirely overwhelming.For me, it's one of Herzog's best and most fascinating works; filled with bold visual imagination, a potent message (and element of satirical intent), room for interpretation, and some incredibly disturbing and enigmatic imagery. More to the point however, the film remains an unrivalled visual experience; one that goes beyond the conventions of story, character and ideology and instead creates a cinema that is simply felt; clearly an absurd and disturbing work of pure cinematic expression. In many respects, I would consider it Herzog's most intense and perhaps even most disturbing film, and one of the most powerful films ever made; with the location, setting, theme, character and visual presentation creating something that is entirely affecting and entirely unforgettable.

But she looks like what most of us aspire to, but don't...which BTW, DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE ARE UNHAPPY AT ALL. We just appreciate beautiful looking people like some others appreciate beautiful art or beautiful scenery. With that in mind, my friends and I have compiled a list of 10 BEST MAKEOVER MOVIES of recent times (after 1995). And here they are (in random order) 1) CLUELESS 2) PRETTY WOMAN 3) THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA 4) JOHN TUCKER MUST DIE 5) MAID IN MANHATTAN 6) MY BIG FAT Greek WEDDING 7) SHE'S ALL THAT 8) MISS CONGENIALITY 9) MEAN GIRLS 10) AMERICANIZING SHELLEY.Although, personally...CLUELESS is #1 and all the others are #2.I am also putting together a different list of 10 BEST MAKEOVER MOVIES of all times (prioe to 1995).
