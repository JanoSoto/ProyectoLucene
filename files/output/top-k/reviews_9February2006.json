You'd panic and lose your mind too.The movie consists of the real footage that was found in the woods, that involved three college students, Heather, Mike, and Josh, filming a documentary about a local legend known as the Blair Witch. First they interviewed several people. Then they headed out into the woods. When they got there, they lost the map, started freaking out, and everything went downhill from there. They found, and heard a lot of evidence that the Blair Witch might be out there. Soon, they realized they were being stalked by something, but they already became hopelessly lost, and scared. Soon, the camera fell over, and they disappeared.This movie is actually truly scary. Not because it shows jump-out surprises, or shocks, but the behavior of the characters is what's scary. How can you be scared by people being scared? said one comment. The answer is that it's not them being scared that scares us. It's the thought of what they're scared of. You never know what could be out there, and there's no way of finding out (the sequel ruined this). The movie was set up as a publicity stunt, and became an internet phenomenon. This movie cheesed off many film goers who were expecting to see a horror movie in the style of the Scream movies. I praise everyone who understands the greatness of this movie.By the way, the movie is very, very scary. When I saw it, I knew I would be disturbed, but this movie shattered my spirits for many months because it was so scary to me. The fact that the movie is COMPLETELY FICTIONAL, wasn't enough to cheer me up. Showing it to a friend was the only thing that could help me feel even a little better.

They're trying to find out what they're gonna do with their lives. While trying to figure that out they also take their first steps to real adulthood, in search of an own identity.This is the kind of humor I like best Rather subtle, yet very sharp. This movie really has it all Sarcasm, cynicism, hilarity and there's even a fart joke and a little drama kicking in at the end. It's amazing to see two young girls act so cynically already. At first GHOST WORLD seems to be humming along just fine, but rather pointless. But very soon you'll discover that every little set-up leads to an appropriate pay-off. There's really no grand conclusion in the end, instead this movie starts on a very high intriguing level and manages to maintain that level throughout the whole movie. It manages to make fun of different types of human beings, but never gets insulting. There's just so many scenes that are bound to leave you with a smile on your face. One of my many personal favorites is were that older guy walks into a videostore and asks the clerk, who clearly knows nothing about movies, about the Fellini-movie 8 1\/2. The clerk looks it up on the computer and then proudly says something like You can find it in the erotic-drama section, yes, 9 1\/2 weeks with Mickey Rourke.The acting ranks from good to excellent. In supporting roles I especially found Illeana Douglas as Roberta extremely funny. She answers to the ultimate clich√© of an art-school teacher. Bob Balaban as Enid's overly gentle dad was enjoyable too. He was so out of touch with his teenage daughter. And Dave Sheridan (with a mustache) as Doug cranks me up every time. It's always nice to see Scarlett Johansson in a movie, but actually she hasn't got much to do in GHOST WORLD. The script just demanded her to be a bit more rational than Enid and not enthusiastic about anything. So that's basically what she does. The real show is actually stolen by Thora Birch as Enid and Steve Buscemi as the record-collecting loner Seymour. They have so many little funny moments together. Thora Birch really shines in this picture portraying Enid as a girl that's everything but ordinary. Her different costumes were superb.The camera-work is excellent. Even when there's a lot of talking going on, you can see that every shot is picked carefully. Terry Zwigoff must have had a perfect understanding with the actors, 'cause it shows. And he makes sure he keeps the camera steady and has it make subtle moves when necessary. The traveling-shots alongside the apartments during the opening-scene were perfect.To me, this movie has no flaws. It might seem a bit slow in the plot-department, but the pacing of witty dialogues isn't. And the best thing about GHOST WORLD is it keeps getting better with every next viewing. It least for me it does. Chances are that next time I see it, I'll be giving it 10 out of 10 stars. So, go watch this movie. It might not be for everybody (in fact, no movie is), but it's a modern-day classic in my opinion. And if you like it, try to get a hold of the DVD 'cause it features the full length video-clip of that Indian song Jaan Pehechaan Ho. Hilarious it is. Oh, and please do read Daniel Clowes' comic books. In case you didn't know already, this movie's based on one of them. And you get to see some artwork of him in it too.

It has become a cult classic, a 'must have' on the movie shelves of college dorm rooms far and wide, and one of the very few films that a person can watch over and over again without growing tired of it.Contrary to popular belief, however, Jay and Silent Bob are not the tandem that drove the film's success. From a moral standpoint, I had a hard time accepting two drug dealers as the lovable losers that Smith would have us believe they are, but beyond that, Jason Mewes isn't all that talented. He speaks every line as though he's in need of adenoidal surgery, and his long hair and droopy clothing no longer disguise the fact that he's over thirty years old. Mewes basically plays himself in every one of his roles, and should probably consider himself lucky to have a famous friend willing to write entire movies for him to star in.The dynamic duo who ARE most responsible for the film's success are Brian O'Halloran and Jeff Anderson playing Dante and Randall, respectively. O'Halloran was brilliantly understated in his role; he is sympathetic without ever directly appealing to the audience to be seen that way. When his girlfriend Veronica claims that he's wasting himself at a dead-end job, we can believe it because of his penchant for subtle humor (I assure you, we're open! and the pay by honor system were both priceless) and his educated vocabulary. Randall was sufficiently smug and condescending to customers, treating them the way many would love to deal with dim people asking inane questions. And to top it off, the dialogue between Dante and Randall just could not have been better it was snappy, witty, and realistic from start to finish.Clerks is a film intended primarily for college guys (Is there a dorm room in the country that doesn't hold a copy of this film?) but that somehow also appeals to people from all walks of life. Educated people can enjoy it for the vocabulary (Perspicacity) and incredibly smart writing. Low brow folks can love the off-color humor and graphic controversies regarding Dante's two girlfriends. And anyone who has ever worked in the convenience\/fast food industry can appreciate the moronic situations that customers present, along with the ways that Dante and Randall deal with them.It is easy to become a Kevin Smith fan simply from watching this movie alone; however, he has not even come close to this standard of excellence since, making several truly wretched films ('Mallrats, Vulgar, Jersey Girl) in the process. If you're thinking about becoming a Kevin Smith follower, do yourself a favor rent Clerks again instead, sit back and watch it for the umpteenth time, and wistfully ponder how good Smith used to be.

The film starts by introducing Joe Buck (Jon Voight) to us. We see him getting dressed in his cowboy suit and packing his suitcase. His suit is loud, with his bright shirt and cowboy hat, in an era that most people did not dress that way. He seems somewhat surreal and over the top. He goes to what seems to be his job and quits because he intends to travel to New York City from Texas. We are not quite sure what his intentions are. He mentions, to a friend, that he wants to become a male hustler when he arrives in New York. He meets many different people on the bus to New York. During this time, we see that Joe is essentially a nice person. There is a scene where he makes friendly gestures towards a kid. This scene is ironic because we get the impression that Joe is also a child. He seems very naive in almost every way. His naivet√© is shown in the way he dresses, thinking himself to be a cowboy, in the way he acts, in the way he feels it is going to be easy to be a male hustler, and in the way he feels living in New York is going to be so much easier than living in Texas.When Joe arrives in New York, he realizes that it was not going to as easy as he thought. He tries to get women to notice him and realize that he is a male hustler but to no avail. One woman does notice him and they have sex. Then she asks him for money for a cab before he asks for money for the sex. When he does, she breaks down and cries. Joe, being a genuinely nice person, offers her money for the cab and she eventually receives twenty dollars. This scene shows how naive Joe really is. Eventually Joe meets the other protagonist in the film, Rico Salvatore Rizzo a.k.a. Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman). Ratso seems to know the ropes and how the city works. He has one limp leg and he does not look like a very trustworthy person at first glance. Eventually, the two create a friendship after Joe needs a place to live and Ratso lets Joe live with him. Together, they meet hard times, without money and they live through a winter without heat.Each main character has a plan or a dream. Joe wants to become a successful male hustler in order to become rich while Ratso wants to go to Florida and live there. It seems, while watching the film, that neither character will achieve his dream. It is sad, but realistic because, for most people, things do not work out the way they plan. In America, we have been taught that anyone can do anything; that is the American dream. This film shows quite the opposite. Joe never becomes a successful hustler and Ratso dies at the end of the film. Midnight Cowboy film mirrors Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper's Easy Rider. Both films deal with journeys and the destruction of the American dream. Both films have sad endings and do not leave the audience with any good feelings. At the end of the film, Joe's naivet√© leaves him at the end of the film. When Joe and Ratso arrive in Florida, Joe has to be one in charge because Ratso is unable to walk. Joe buys new clothes and dumps his cowboy outfit. This is the first time we see him without it. After Ratso dies, we know that Joe has to fend for himself and grow up.As I said before, this was a unique film. It had great performances by Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman. It was superbly directed by John Schlesinger. The film still seems to be odd to me but a likable film nonetheless. It will go down as one of the best modern classics out there. I recommend the film.

His mere presence ensures that the film will be well worth seeing, and like all his previous and later westerns; that statement is true of The Outlaw Josey Whales also. Not that this film is an Eastwood performance and nothing more, of course - his starring role definitely benefits the proceedings, but the story Eastwood presents is certainly nothing to be sneered at! The film is an epic in every sense of the word, and through the sprawling locations and lengthy plot, Eastwood's fourth film as director and star serves as both a fitting tribute to Sergio Leone; the director whom he made his name with, and an excellent western in its own right. The plot follows a farmer whose family is murdered by Union soldiers. He joins up with a Confederate guerrilla unit, and eventually finds himself living within a community. Overall, we follow him as the war turns him from a simple farmer into the most wanted man in the west.You can always count on a strong lead performance from any film that has Clint Eastwood's name at the top of the actor's credit list, and The Outlaw Josey Whales certainly doesn't disappoint in that respect. It's obvious the director and star put his heart into this film, and even though he's merely playing the anonymous drifter that is synonymous with his name, the performance comes off with real verve and the man is always believable in his role. As you might expect from a western, the film is heavy in the action department, and Eastwood ensures that his film is never too far away from another shootout. However, the real impact of the movie doesn't come from a weapon, but from the progress that the central character makes throughout the movie. Any other person in an Eastwood film is always going to be second to the man himself, and this is certainly the case here. However, the likes of Chief Dan George and Clint's then girlfriend, Sandra Locke still manage to make an impression; even if it is obvious why the latter is in the movie. On the whole, this film is sure to please western fans, particularly those who are a fan of the great man behind this one. Well worth seeing!

It's one of the best I've ever heard and it never fails to captivate me. Everyone writing a comment for this site about their favorite film scores is sharing an incredible list of their personal favorites. They're all magnificent! And the discussion is extremely intelligent and perceptive. One score that everyone seems to have omitted, however, is the music by Victor Young for Shane. Another classic film. The first adult western (as it's often called). The score unequivocally fits into this list of the best. I must admit that there are finer, more elaborate scores. But the music for Shane fits. And it, too, is a musical heritage that other composers have reached to match. Although there are more robust musical compositions for the movies, none is more memorable than Eyes of Blue from Shane. Victor Young did what he was hired to do -- the true mark of a professional. Young was to provide music that fit. He could have gone over the top with his effort but he didn't. He helped make this film a classic with music that is subtle and effective and not at all intrusive.
