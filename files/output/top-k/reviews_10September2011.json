[{"date":"10 September 2011","score":"","review":" Shrek is the revolutionary stepping stone of DreamWorks Animation. It tells the story of an ogre named Shrek, who goes on a daring journey with a talking donkey, to save a princess from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava. Along the way, Shrek learns about love and friendship, and to not be judged for the way we look before you know that particular person. Shrek is one of the most beautiful, heartwarming, and hilarious pieces of animation I have ever seen in a long time. The hilarious casting ensemble of Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, & John Lithgow provided incredible animated performances that stole our hearts forever. Every moment is to die of laughter, especially when the movie is like a parody to the classic fairytale children stories. From the enchanting storyline, the groundbreaking animation, to the wonderful characters, Shrek is a loving story that should be told and remembered for a long, long time. Shrek is one of the best animated movies ever, and it should remain a classic for years to come. That's quite an accomplishment for an ogre story. Shrek, in my review, an enchanting motion picture, fun for the whole family.
