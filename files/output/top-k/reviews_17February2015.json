[{"date":"17 February 2015","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Overrated, over-extended, over-pseudo-intellectual, boring cliché- ridden garbage. So-much-so, I stopped watching halfway through. Another proof that morons rule. Lame effects with those gliding-flying self-driving round cars. Didn't we see that back in the 30's and 50's sci-fi flicks? 70 years later, but cars are still not flying, still need a driver, still burning gasoline. In 2054 people will watch this pop-culture brainless waste of time and laugh at us. Time travel or future prediction is a fascinating idea, but Mr. Spielberg is too small-minded and uncultured to show us something truly original and innovative. The best they can do, are jet-packs (has been done 1000 times), Plexiglas video screens (done 100 times) and gliding self-driving cars (done 10,000 times). ...BORING!!!!!!!!!!!

","genre":"Action, Mystery, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"17 February 2015","score":"","review":" This movie offers less in terms of plot twists, character development and acting than what I think people realise. Morgan Freeman delivers a characteristically mundane performance and the other characters dance forgettably around him.There are few to no memorable quotes and even less action, and the only real twist, at the end, could be the most overrated twist of all time.I only watched this after it was deemed a must by most of my close peers and fellow movie critics, only to be gravely disappointed with their judgments. If this movie has taught me anything, it is that IMDb ratings mean jack and that people are, in general, conformist in nature ; they rate movies highly if their fellow humans talk it up. Who could forget the terrible acting and the sexual innuendos in this movie? The only reason that the director put that in there was to make it feel more prison like, but for me it felt as if he was trying to plug a bathtub with a million holes. A tub full of vomit to begin with.Frankly, I do not care if this is an unpopular view. And neither should you. Popularity is a reflection of the current state of society's desires, nothing more.
