They discover that not only is the house haunted, the force that resides there is determined to kill them before their week is up.The screenplay is written by Richard Matheson from his book Hell House, and it is not one of the best I've seen from him. The idea is a little muddled, especially during the conclusion of the film, which offers a dubious explanation for the events that have come before. The script also has its contrivances, the most notable of which is the fact that the house's windows have been bricked up. This, of course, explains the fact that the movie is obviously filmed on a constructed set and not in a real house with real windows. I also couldn't help wonder who did most of the housekeeping at Hell House. Aside from some random cobwebs, the place seemed to be in rather good condition for an abandoned old mansion.The sets themselves, however, are delightfully bizarre, and the film has a great sense of foreboding.The tone is very 70s, and at times the sets made it seem like I was watching one of Hammer's horror productions. The movie's shocks are somewhat diluted by the passage of time, and if this is all The Legend of Hell House had going for it, then I doubt anybody would talk about it much today. But certain elements of the film stick with you long after it's over, particularly the scene where one of the characters appears to be raped by a ghost. There are also some great scenes where something horrible seems like it's about to happen, and then suddenly it doesn't. These moments work especially well, as it's the dread of the moment that delivers the goods, and not a monster jumping out of the shadows to grab someone. For instance, at one point there appears to be somebody in a shower. Then we see that whatever's in there is clearly not human, and it's not in good shape either. A character rips open the curtain to discover...nothing inside but a dead cat.The somewhat silly explanation for the haunting brings it down a little, and there was something else I found to be unintentionally amusing too since the lack of windows makes it difficult to note the passage of time, the director resorts to repeated subtitles that give the date and time of the scenes. After the tenth time these appeared, I started giggling whenever they showed up...sometimes within minutes of each other!Still, this apparently made quite an impression at the time of its release, and it does push the envelope a little for horror movies of its day. There are a few mild expletives delivered by a demonic sounding voice, and an important element of the haunting involves an ominous sexual undercurrent. Recommended mostly for fans of 70s horror, and those who appreciate elements of subtle horror along with more obvious shocks.

How can he make it? Something like that anyway. The clichés came so thick and fast I couldn't remember them all. I couldn't even GRASP them all quickly enough, piled as they were, one atop the other, like a pile of Leggos.I don't really think it's necessary to bother with the script except to say a rogue group of Russians hijacks Air Force One, is overcome by the President of the United States, and most of the good guys are saved and all of the bad guys perish, usually in some colorful fashion.Wolfgang Petersen made a gripping movie with Das Boot. It was a long flick of mostly quiet moments, a leisurely examination of life aboard a U-Boat, punctuated with shocking moments of action. In Air Force One Petersen's talents have been -- dare I say hijacked by Hollywood? There is no leisurely examination of anything. There is neither leisure nor examination. All the parts that might bore a twelve-year-old weaned on Call of Duty have been cut out of the script and nothing is left but one recycled action scene after another, some of them already parodied in Airplane, backed up by a booming score.Here's an indication of how the movie was assembled, the kind of thought that went into it. When it was released there appeared an article in the NY Times written by an actor (whose name I now forget) playing one of the characters (whose name I don't know) in innocent conversation with Harrison Ford as the President, when shots are heard from elsewhere in Air Force One as the takeover starts.As the actor described the first run-through, at the sound of the gunshots, he rose to his feet and sauntered over to the window to find out what was up. He was told he'd have to jump to his feet and run to the door. Why? he asked. The Secret Service is aboard, there are security agents all over. Nobody could possibly be expecting an armed attack. A normal reaction would be to try to find out what the noise was. He was told by the director that everyone in the scene would immediately recognize the gunshots for exactly what they were. Ford, a seasoned veteran of such attacks, told the actor tiredly, They're gunshots, period. Why waste three or four flaccid seconds having the actor stroll to the door? That kind of dedication and efficiency is in evidence throughout Air Force One. Bang, bang, whoosh, zap. The President, by the way, is practically superhuman. He speaks Russian albeit with a gloopi American accent. He cuts his bound wrists free and immediately disarms and kills two or three of his captors. I lost count. Well, okay, he was a CMH winner. But then how did he learn to fly a jumbo jet? Never mind.A more interesting question is how did they pick the villains? Kazakhistan rebels? A rogue group of Russians? This is rather retro stuff because absolutely nobody watching the movie knows or cares about Kazakhistan or its internal affairs. The simple fact is that viewers will see and hear the heavies speaking Russian and that will be enough for them. (I forget when Crimson Tide was released, using the same ploy. It's the Russkies again alright, only a splinter group.) The faces of American fighter pilots are illuminated by a comforting pale off-white light, while their opposite numbers are as green as algae. To top it off, the Russian Premier looks like Jonathan Winters coming down from battery acid while our President looks exactly like Harrison Ford. And if you STILL don't get the point, the Kazakhhomaniac rebels sing a rousing version of Die Internazionale. Nowadays, of course, nine years later, they'd all be speaking Arabic.The movie offers some fascinating tidbits in addition to its knuckle-whitening suspense. The set representing the interior of Air Force One, for instance. It's full of nooks and crannies and it seems about the size of the Dixie Hotel. Functional furniture, but comfortable and expensive. Soundproof, bulletproof, insulated against an atomic blast. A staff of well-trained servants who know when to leave the master alone to ponder weighty questions about the world's future. (In all these respects it rather resembles my place.) It also has a steam pipe, which the list of clichés calls for, just as in those factories or warehouses in which the final shootout takes place in other action movies. The steam pipe is shot up and people in pursuit of each other wisp their way through the mist. What is that steam pipe doing there? Have we been mistaken all these years about how jet engines work? Are modern airplanes really powered by the same plants that made the Stanley Steamer roll on its merry way? I half expected Ford to stumble across the gigantic elastic band that spun the engine blandes. What makes it finally so preposterous is the notion that this or any other country could organize itself with such alacrity and efficiency in the face of an unexpected emergency of these proportions. When the president finally contacts the situation room and asks who has taken over Air Force One, the reply is, A group of Russian ultra-nationalists. This is nothing more than cashing in on ancient hatreds for a buck. And we pay for that self satisfaction on the world stage, by damaging the image of America abroad. How about a Russian movie in which a group of murdering thugs tries to kidnap Vladimir Putin and they are called American ultra-nationalists?

I have never, ever seen a movie that inspiring in my life. Any time I would hear a person talk about how a movie inspired them I would laugh. I mean we've all seen great movies, but I have never thought longer then 2 seconds about a movie after I saw it. Braveheart is the only movie that i have seen more than 5 times. It is simply an amazing piece of film. The first time I saw this movie, I couldn't even move. It was that brilliant. I am not someone who cares for 99% of movies. And ones like the Godfather, Shawshank, North by Northwest, are all very good, but none, and I mean none even approach the level of filmamking that Braveheart attained. As far as the movie itself goes, there are much better writers then I here on IMDb who can artfully tell you the brilliance of this film. I don't know too much about all that. But I do know that after watching this film, I felt truly inspired, and I mean I really did. The scenery of this film along with the music truly elevates this movie to a level most films would die to get to. But it is the content of this film that resonates so deeply in me.This film is crafted to near perfection to touch on the rawest of human emotions, freedom and pain. The freedom isn't some corny word that most lame ass liberal Americans throw around these days, it was a visceral word. A word that was real. A word that stood for more than some college professors rant on Bush. Braveheart elevates the theme of freedom to something to die for. Not only does the film do that, but it introduces love as freedoms only companion. Wallace played by Gibson, rises to the occasion of playing a passionate Scot who wants to free his homeland. That plot alone sounds basic, right? But somehow, it rises to what it is suppose to rise to..brilliance. I know people have challenged this movies historical portrayals, but that is really not relevant. This film isn't played in schools in Scotland, or anywhere for that matter, to teach them some Scottish history.

I have never, ever seen a movie that inspiring in my life. Any time I would hear a person talk about how a movie inspired them I would laugh. I mean we've all seen great movies, but I have never thought longer then 2 seconds about a movie after I saw it. Braveheart is the only movie that i have seen more than 5 times. It is simply an amazing piece of film. The first time I saw this movie, I couldn't even move. It was that brilliant. I am not someone who cares for 99% of movies. And ones like the Godfather, Shawshank, North by Northwest, are all very good, but none, and I mean none even approach the level of filmamking that Braveheart attained. As far as the movie itself goes, there are much better writers then I here on IMDb who can artfully tell you the brilliance of this film. I don't know too much about all that. But I do know that after watching this film, I felt truly inspired, and I mean I really did. The scenery of this film along with the music truly elevates this movie to a level most films would die to get to. But it is the content of this film that resonates so deeply in me.This film is crafted to near perfection to touch on the rawest of human emotions, freedom and pain. The freedom isn't some corny word that most lame ass liberal Americans throw around these days, it was a visceral word. A word that was real. A word that stood for more than some college professors rant on Bush. Braveheart elevates the theme of freedom to something to die for. Not only does the film do that, but it introduces love as freedoms only companion. Wallace played by Gibson, rises to the occasion of playing a passionate Scot who wants to free his homeland. That plot alone sounds basic, right? But somehow, it rises to what it is suppose to rise to..brilliance. I know people have challenged this movies historical portrayals, but that is really not relevant. This film isn't played in schools in Scotland, or anywhere for that matter, to teach them some Scottish history.

Lee Ermey, Arliss Howard, Adam Baldwin, Dorian Harewood.There is one scene in 'Full Metal Jacket' that I want to talk about first. It is the scene near the very beginning with Leonard Lawrence and Gunnery Sgt. Hartman. Lawrence thinks that Hartman is very funny, but as the film goes on, he starts to hate him more and more.'Full Metal Jacket' is really a different type of war film. It doesn't deal with war battles between Vietnam and America, but battles against ourselves. I don't mean like gun battles, I mean the way that we might feel when we see this film, we realize that we basically fought each other.Soldiers are trained by a mean drill instructor to begin killers, then you actually witness them doing it. The film is divided into two halves. The first half revolves mostly around Pvt. Joker, Pvt. Lawrence (Gomer Pyle), and Drill Instructor Hartman. The soldiers go through training at a South Carolina Marine Corps camp. Joker is the second leader in the group, and Pyle is ranked lower in the platoon because Hartman dislikes him and believes that he cannot do anything. Pyle doesn't have any friends on the squad and only is good at one thing, combat training.The second half is set in Vietnam. It revolves around Joker, Animal Mother, Eightball, and Cowboy, one of Joker's old buddies from training. They go off to fight as gunmen in the war, but also must save their fellow soldiers. Joker believes that war is a living hell, but at the same time, he believes that after fighting there will soon be peace.'Full Metal Jacket' probably isn't the best war film ever made, but it is a great film. It has a good story, another brilliant direction by Stanley Kubrick, and interesting characters. The acting in the movie is just almost perfect. Lee Ermey gives his best and very memorable performance as Sgt. Hartman, mostly because he was a drill instructor in real life. Modine and D'Onofrio were also very good. Dorian Harewood and Adam Baldwin deliver clever lines, and are interesting characters. There are much humor in the film, and it actually is funny. Some of Ermey's line are very clever. It's interesting how he they thought up all of his lines.At times, the film doesn't really fit together. It shows some unrelated material to the story. It loses its pace near the beginning of the second half, but recovers a little later in the movie. Joker's (Modine) narration throughout the movie goes no where. It's horribly told. I'm not saying that Modine was a bad actor, because he wasn't, but the narration sounds like he read it off of flashcards. The first scene that I mentioned really made feel bad for Pvt. Pyle, and it got worse later in the film. Pyle seems like he is Hartman's main victim, mostly because he seems worthless.'Full Metal Jacket' is a really good movie and almost a classic. I don't know how it could have been better, but it is fine the way it is. It is one of the best from Kubrick, and is underrated by some people, but is loved by others. Overall the first half is one of the most effective pieces of film I've ever seen, whereas the second is more or less just good. 4.5 out of 5 stars.

My first, now deleted comment was only a reaction of my surprise, how captivating, moving, and impressive this movie was for me, when i saw it again in 2005, more than 30 years after i saw it for the first time as a child. In the meantime, i saw it approx. 20-30 times again and due every seeing, it reveals more of its depth. So i started a exploration to find out more about it The technique, art, Walt Disney and all the other man behind it... The essence of all is quite simple It is, in every aspect, a monument of pure poetry and pure art! It contains only approx. 900 words of dialogs, in which was more said than in many books with 1000 pages, with a runtime of 70 minutes, it contains more depth and epic than almost every 3-hours film. It is a story about the life himself, with all the light and all the darkness.It's not a fairy tale. There is no princess to be rescued, no spell to be broken, no villain to be defeated. It contains not a typical storyline. It don't need such trivial things! It was not forced toward by what happens next suspense, it flows like the seasons, it goes on with the power of nature. It is the first and the truest circle of life, that Walt Disney created. Bambi was often called the typical Disney film, but in fact, it is the most non typical Disney film! Whoever ventured in became part of an experience so strong that neither heart nor mind could ever forget it's impact!Disney and his crew didn't translate Felix Salten's Book literally into film. This was impossible due the huge differences between the technique of storytelling in a book and a film, but they catch the inner spirit that Salten described. It took more than 5 years of hard work to find the right way in transforming the book's soul into a film. And the way that they finally found was perhaps the only way that pay the highest homage to Salten's book.You may be disappointed, because there is no really a plot in it (this is according to Salten's book too; it is more a collection of incidents, that enabled the young fawn to learn the profound lessons which in time made him the wisest deer in the forest). It may be boring for some people when they saw it for the first time. But if you submerge in it, you will explore a whole new world. So forget all about story lines and plots, common in almost all movies. Let delve yourself by the gorgeous opening scene into Bambi's world! Align your expectations to that of the young fawn. It may be look so mundane, when Bambi starts to discover the world around him. The flowers, the rain, the other animals, but every new discovery is a revelation. It is the same adventure, that all of us have experienced in our childhood.Later, the world starts to reveal his somber side. The first time on the meadow, when Bambi must run away from the hunters. The first fun in the wintertime turned into the danger of starvation for the deer. And then, right after the first fresh spring grass evoke new hope, follows on of the most iconic scenes in movie history. It is a perfect off camera-scene and the turn point of the whole film, a symbol for the end of childhood and innocence for our young hero. For many young children (and for me too, when i was 5 or 6 years old and saw Bambi for the first time) this seminal scene was the first experience, that the world can be very cruel... it took more than a half century, before Disney dared a similar scene in The Lion King again. Bambi was often criticized as an anti hunting movie. But is this true? No. Felix Salten, author of the book Bambi, was a hunter too Perhaps only a hunter that is common with all the animals around him can wrote such a penetrating and deep story. The whole story was told trough the eyes of the animals. Man was not a typical villain with a goal, i.e. to conquer the world, to be the king or something else. Man was more like a deadly force majeure, a storm, a volcano or an earthquake, and his acting was a riddle for the limited minds of the forest creatures, and when Disney decided to let Man unseen in the whole movie, he strengthen the feeling of a dark menace. Bambi did not need a common plot nor need it sophisticated dialogs too. The story was primary told with music, colors, light and impressionistic color-shifting to depict Bambi's inner feelings rather than words. Bambi's forest is a powerful and truth, yet poetic and ethereal interpretation of the forests of our dreams...and sometimes of our nightmares, too. Bambi connecting art and poetry with reality in a way that has never seen before and never seen again. It is a movie that follows his own rules, a awesome work of art, that is comparable to Mozart's compositions or to the paintings of Leonardo da Vinci!Bambi gives the most honest, gritty portrayal of the full range of art, poetry and emotion in the history of cinema. It moves you, it let you laugh, it let you cry, it let you fear, it gives you hope. It is a film about friendship and the strength of character, and about the spirit of life!There never has and never will be another film like Bambi, it is unique and timeless. Walt Disney himself always said, that Bambi is his favorite of all his movies. I'm fully agree with Walt Bambi is an immortal classic and one of the most important films of all time!

It is twisted, disturbing, and ultimately haunting. It is a masterpiece that shows us a look inside the mind of an intelligent, yet disturbed youth.The plot is about an older teen named Alex who enjoys listening to Beethoven, skipping school, and hanging out with his friends during the evening in a not too distant future. He is obsessed with sex\/rape (the old in-out) and ultra violence so much that he thinks about it almost all the time. During the nights, he and his droogs either hang out at a milk bar, terrorize bums on the street, or get into brawls. They get into a gang fight, steal a car, break into a writer's house, beat up the writer and rape his wife right in front of his eyes.The next night, Alex accidentally kills a woman inside her home. When he leaves, his friends betray him and leave him for the police. Alex is sent to prison for years because of his crime. In prison, he hears of something that can cure people from their problems. The doctors decide to test it on Alex by flashing images onto a screen, images that Alex is obsessed with. When Alex is released, his former victims and friends plot revenge on him.'A Clockwork Orange' is a thought-provoking piece of film that still delivers after over 30 years. It had a powerful impact on me by the film's finale. Content wise, I don't recommend it to everyone. It is extremely graphic with strong use of sexuality and nudity. If that doesn't bother you then you should see this. It really isn't as disturbing as it sounds.Stanley Kubrick, once again, gives a wonderful direction. I love the way that he directed his movies, almost all of them are great. The soundtrack is very great with Beethoven's Ninth and the film's original score. The composer of the original score, Wendy Carlos, does an excellent job of giving a haunting score.The words to describe Alex De Large are sick, perverted, twisted, and despicable. I'd be surprised if anyone couldn't tell that already, even after the grin he gives to the camera after the opening credits. Alex has a wide imagination, even if his thoughts are somewhat disturbing. Malcolm McDowell plays him masterfully. I really didn't expect the movie to be like this. I expected it to be some sort of Cyber-Thriller, but it turned out to be a powerful experience.This movie was adapted from the novel by Anthony Burgess. I admit, I never read the novel, but I really understood the movie.

It is twisted, disturbing, and ultimately haunting. It is a masterpiece that shows us a look inside the mind of an intelligent, yet disturbed youth.The plot is about an older teen named Alex who enjoys listening to Beethoven, skipping school, and hanging out with his friends during the evening in a not too distant future. He is obsessed with sex\/rape (the old in-out) and ultra violence so much that he thinks about it almost all the time. During the nights, he and his droogs either hang out at a milk bar, terrorize bums on the street, or get into brawls. They get into a gang fight, steal a car, break into a writer's house, beat up the writer and rape his wife right in front of his eyes.The next night, Alex accidentally kills a woman inside her home. When he leaves, his friends betray him and leave him for the police. Alex is sent to prison for years because of his crime. In prison, he hears of something that can cure people from their problems. The doctors decide to test it on Alex by flashing images onto a screen, images that Alex is obsessed with. When Alex is released, his former victims and friends plot revenge on him.'A Clockwork Orange' is a thought-provoking piece of film that still delivers after over 30 years. It had a powerful impact on me by the film's finale. Content wise, I don't recommend it to everyone. It is extremely graphic with strong use of sexuality and nudity. If that doesn't bother you then you should see this. It really isn't as disturbing as it sounds.Stanley Kubrick, once again, gives a wonderful direction. I love the way that he directed his movies, almost all of them are great. The soundtrack is very great with Beethoven's Ninth and the film's original score. The composer of the original score, Wendy Carlos, does an excellent job of giving a haunting score.The words to describe Alex De Large are sick, perverted, twisted, and despicable. I'd be surprised if anyone couldn't tell that already, even after the grin he gives to the camera after the opening credits. Alex has a wide imagination, even if his thoughts are somewhat disturbing. Malcolm McDowell plays him masterfully. I really didn't expect the movie to be like this. I expected it to be some sort of Cyber-Thriller, but it turned out to be a powerful experience.This movie was adapted from the novel by Anthony Burgess.

There are other problems as well and we realize that there is no way that the son could receive a new heart and the father takes justice in his own hands. It's a wonderful movie about the average citizen whose love is much more expensive than rich people's wealth. The movie is realistic in some ways.

Jerry Lewis. Every generation has their dose of silliness. The 1990s had Jim Carrey. And along with him came the phenomenal hit Dumb and Dumber, a simple tale of two numb skulls who journey to Aspen in search of a woman and happiness.Our tale begins when Lloyd (Jim Carrey) is escorting a young woman named Mary Swanson (the gorgeous Lauren Holly, who Carrey eventually married and then divorced) to an airport. He falls in love with her in the few minutes they share in the limousine, and after he has dropped her off, he watches her from the outside in his limo and sees her leave behind a black briefcase on the floor inside the airport. Rushing inside, he grabs the briefcase, only to find someone closing the gate to her plane. It's okay, I'm a limo driver! he yells to a ticket checker, rushing down the airport jet way and running straight off of it, falling onto the cement runway below.After retreating to his apartment, he convinces his pal Harry (Jeff Daniels) to come with him to Aspen to return the briefcase to Mary. Harry, the smarter one (or is that dumb-less one?), at first hesitates, and then reluctantly agrees, and so they are off. Little do they know that the briefcase they carry is actually ransom money that Mary was trying to pay to get her husband returned to her. Now with hitment on their tail, Lloyd and Harry make it to Aspen only to wreak even more havoc.Comedic timing is everything in a comedy like this. Carrey and Daniels have chemistry and timing. Check out the scene where they are at the National Preservation Society Gala, and stand at a bar in bright, tasteless suits. The way they stand, talk, and interact is as if they really are bosom-buddies, two idiots without a clue.The film is directed by The Farrelly Brothers, Peter and Bobby. You may remember them as the men who brought us the hilarious There's Something About Mary. But truth be told, Dumb and Dumber is even better than Mary. Whereas Mary was a fun summer comedy with big laughs and tons of crude sex jokes, Dumb and Dumber is a true comedic gem, and carefully borders the line of tastelessness and taste, something Mary crosses over and never turns back to.Is this movie dumb? Yes, absolutely. Will it offend you? Perhaps if you're a snob. And I'm sure some film elitists will complain that there's nothing substantial or of artistic merit here.I don't think it matters. This movie is meant to entertain and it does so wonderfully. In the past I've given negative ratings to films of the same genre that are just meant to be brain-less, silly fare (such as Me, Myself & Irene) - the difference here is that Dumb and Dumber manages to come across as both likable and entertaining, while still managing to feature characters we can actually, in some crazy way, find ourselves liking.In the end, this is just a very funny movie that is well-made and memorable - much more so than some of its other 1990s stupid-comedy counterparts.

He falls in love with her in the few minutes they share in the limousine, and after he has dropped her off, he watches her from the outside in his limo and sees her leave behind a black briefcase on the floor inside the airport. Rushing inside, he grabs the briefcase, only to find someone closing the gate to her plane. It's okay, I'm a limo driver! he yells to a ticket checker, rushing down the airport jet way and running straight off of it, falling onto the cement runway below.After retreating to his apartment, he convinces his pal Harry (Jeff Daniels) to come with him to Aspen to return the briefcase to Mary. Harry, the smarter one (or is that dumb-less one?), at first hesitates, and then reluctantly agrees, and so they are off. Little do they know that the briefcase they carry is actually ransom money that Mary was trying to pay to get her husband returned to her. Now with hitment on their tail, Lloyd and Harry make it to Aspen only to wreak even more havoc.Comedic timing is everything in a comedy like this. Carrey and Daniels have chemistry and timing. Check out the scene where they are at the National Preservation Society Gala, and stand at a bar in bright, tasteless suits. The way they stand, talk, and interact is as if they really are bosom-buddies, two idiots without a clue.The film is directed by The Farrelly Brothers, Peter and Bobby. You may remember them as the men who brought us the hilarious There's Something About Mary. But truth be told, Dumb and Dumber is even better than Mary. Whereas Mary was a fun summer comedy with big laughs and tons of crude sex jokes, Dumb and Dumber is a true comedic gem, and carefully borders the line of tastelessness and taste, something Mary crosses over and never turns back to.Is this movie dumb? Yes, absolutely. Will it offend you? Perhaps if you're a snob. And I'm sure some film elitists will complain that there's nothing substantial or of artistic merit here.I don't think it matters. This movie is meant to entertain and it does so wonderfully. In the past I've given negative ratings to films of the same genre that are just meant to be brain-less, silly fare (such as Me, Myself & Irene) - the difference here is that Dumb and Dumber manages to come across as both likable and entertaining, while still managing to feature characters we can actually, in some crazy way, find ourselves liking.In the end, this is just a very funny movie that is well-made and memorable - much more so than some of its other 1990s stupid-comedy counterparts.

The most beautiful and harrowing aspect of Sanjuro for the townspeople, is that he is his own bodyguard. He is endowed with this poetic perfection, which nobody else has... he almost doesn't exist for them (he is absent during all revenges), because this is unfathomable to everyone in the town. He is God. He is just, brings justice, above all notions of justice. This movie defeats all people who find it boring, and all who could possibly revere it to death, me included. It exists alone.

The man is Antonio Ricci (Lamberto Maggiorani), who goes on a quest to find his bicycle after it gets stolen on his first day at work. The society is post-WWII Rome, where jobs are scarce, money is tight, and nearly everyone is so desperate that they could be driven to thievery.The Bicycle Thief claims to be a slice of life, but it actually has been carefully scripted to ensure sufficient variety and drama. It utilizes as many different locations as possible Antonio's search takes him to a busy pawn shop, a police station, an open-air market, a church mission, a restaurant, a fortune-teller's, and a brothel. All these different locations present a vivid portrait of post-war, lower-class Rome, contextualizing Antonio's story and defining Neorealism in the process. However, at times there is a little too much of this emphasis on location and atmosphere. The most compelling part of the film is the relationship between Antonio and his young son Bruno (Enzo Staiola), but it sometimes gets lost amid all the vignettes.After watching the movie, I was amazed to discover that the actors were amateurs--their performances are so good! Maggiorani is subtle, never hammy; child actor Staiola is endearing without seeming fake; and together they work up a very convincing father-son dynamic. If the movie sometimes loses its course when trying to address the issue of society at large, it never once falters in the realistic, moving scenes between Antonio and Bruno.For some reason, I like and admire, rather than adore, The Bicycle Thief. However, it's definitely a well-made, oftentimes compelling film about poverty and its effects on families.

Maggiorani is subtle, never hammy; child actor Staiola is endearing without seeming fake; and together they work up a very convincing father-son dynamic. If the movie sometimes loses its course when trying to address the issue of society at large, it never once falters in the realistic, moving scenes between Antonio and Bruno.For some reason, I like and admire, rather than adore, The Bicycle Thief. However, it's definitely a well-made, oftentimes compelling film about poverty and its effects on families. And, more importantly, it proved that well-made movies don't have to have glossy production values and famous stars, and that stories like Antonio's are worthy of being told on screen.

The storyline is simple & in no way complex nor is the acting stellar. The star power consists of Kurt Russell, Jason Scott Lee(Bruce Lee Story), Jason Isaacs(The Patriot), Connie Neilsen, Michael Chiklis(The Commish, etc.), and the ever strange Gary Busey. The basic sci-fi film buffs will appreciate the film's subtle nuances while the more serious sci-fi connoisseurs will scoff at the same.Soldier chronicles the life of Sgt. Todd(Russell) who from birth to adulthood endures intense military training, psychological brainwashing, & countless war campaigns to become an elite soldier. Todd is the best soldier in his squadron under the command of stern Cpt. Church(Busey). Unbeknownst to Church, a new breed of soldier has been created to challenge the old order, spearheaded by egotistical Colonel Mekum(Isaacs). Mekum's best soldier, Caine 607(Lee), competes against Todd & several others only to defeat them easily. Left for dead, Todd is dumped on a waste planet to rot. Barely alive, Todd manages to make his way to a secret colony of planet survivors. Taken in & cared for by colony elder Mace(Sean Pertwee), Sandra(Neilsen), & mute son Nathan, Todd recuperates under a watchful eye. Wary & suspicious, members of the colony inquire how Todd found his way to their hideout. During his stay, Todd is confused & bewildered by the simplest of human behavior. Todd knows combat & killing, not civilized behaviors. After several incidents including Mace's son, Todd is expelled from the colony to fend for himself. Meanwhile, the military has located the presence of life forms on the waste planet. Colonel Mekum makes plans to wage a private war against the colonists to test the superiority of his elite fighting force led by Caine 607. After attacks have been executed the survivors, Mace searches & finds the lonely Sgt. Todd. On the way back to the stronghold, Mace is killed by enemy fire. Todd, sensing his humanity for the first time, runs back to aid the helpless colonists. Todd equips himself with weaponry & conducts a seek & destroy mission against the military forces. Cunning & resourceful, Todd takes out the enemy with precise maneuvers & strategic planning. Finally, the two best soldiers meet for a battle to the death Sgt. Todd & Caine 607. Both men beat on each other heavily with Todd rising as the victor. Todd takes the remaining colonists to the military ship to leave the planet for good. After disposing of Colonel Mekum & his officers, Todd assumes command of the crew & takes off to a distant planet to start over. Todd looks out at space holding young Nathan, feeling more like the human he has become rather than the soldier he had always been.Soldier will provide minimal entertainment for a minimal price; your time. Russell's portrayal is fairly dull & wooden which is what he played very well. Lee provided little in the way of acting support to Russell as the evil but elite soldier Caine 607. Busey gives you his usual trademark toothiness & unorthodox acting style but I suppose added some measure of quirkiness to the mix. Jason Isaacs is at his maniacal best as he usually does playing the villain Merkum. Overall, this film gets it's message across, even though it has to pull the viewer along kicking & screaming to get it. If you have an empty social calender & have a few hours to spare, give Soldier a look-see. Hell, I did.

Despite everything - including the one affair to which he confessed, after being found out - his wife, Victoria Abril, still loves him passionately but he is always too bushed to respond to her amorous advances. Enter writer-director Balasko as a cigar-smoking lesbian; she calls at the house in Chabat's absence to ask for water for her car's radiator, stays to fix a blocked sink - oh, you HAVE got dirty minds - and seduce Abril. Subsequently she moves in, The Dyke Who Came To Dinner if you will and this, naturally, arouses Chabat's jealousy; NOW he wants his wife.

If a friend saw this movie by chance and told me the outline, omitting to mention the underlying warmth of Balasko, who's about as convincing as a butch lesbian as Arnie would be as a ballerina, and the sympathetic way it deals with alternative lifestyles I'd probably have avoided it like anything by Godard but knowing Balasko's fine track record as well as that of fellow director-actor Chabat to say nothing of Ticky Holgado I snapped up the DVD and I'm glad I did.
