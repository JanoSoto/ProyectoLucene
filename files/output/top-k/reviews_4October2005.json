I'm not a Cameron Diaz fan nor do I tend to like most chick flicks. However, this one had me consistently laughing and noticing similarities between me and my friends.Odds are, if you are a straight male, you will not like this movie. The target demographic for this one is definitely girls in their late teens up to women in their mid-thirties. Thats my guess as to why this movie didn't do very well and why some people don't like it. As a twenty something female, this movie is dead on. My friends and I are that blunt with each other about men and relationships, and going out to bars drinking and dancing and having fun in no way makes me, my friends, or the characters in this film promiscuous as one user said.While the acting or directing is by no means great, this is the kind of film that isn't meant to be great. Its light and funny and written by one of the writers of South Park. This is the perfect movie if a girlfriend just got dumped, or a chick flick night, or something like that. If you're looking for a great film with remarkable acting and plot, this isn't it, but if you want something fun that you can laugh at again and again, then by all means.I'm tired of users ripping movies like this to shreds when they're clearly not the demographic. Sure, there are going to be women in their 20's who think this is movie is dumb and not at all true to life, but for me and so many other women I know, its right on.

Her husband is thrown through the windshield and killed. Spader is hospitalized with various pieces of shiny steel holding his long bones in place. He finds the pain and discomfort and immobilization so arousing that when his wife (Unger) visits him it leads to masturbation. There's a lot of that sort of thing in this movie.You'd never think Holly Hunter would suffer from such a paraphilia but she does. So does Spader's wife. Hunter and Spader run into each other, figuratively, in a garage full of wrecked cars and make furious love in one of the surrealistically twisted carcasses.Before you know it, the Spader family and Hunter have fallen in with a group of -- well, there's no easy name for people of this quality. Koteas, the head of this underground cohort, is some sort of show-business stunt driver who, with a few associated, restages fatal car crashes of celebrities. Spader and Hunter are one of a dozen or two spectators who come to watch the staging of the 1955 crash between James Dean's Porsche and a Ford driven by somebody named Turnipseed. None of the men involved in the stunt wear helmets or seat belts and there are no roll bars or any of that wimpy stuff. Koteas' shiny Porsche Spider backs up, then speeds full blast into the front of the Ford. Kaboom. Sirens burping, the cops arrive and everyone scuttles for cover. It is never explained exactly how Koteas makes enough money to smash up beautifully restored Fords and Porsches. (His next big show will involve the decapitation of Jane Mansfield.) At Koteas' home they watch movies of test crashes with dummies instead of porn.Spader's wife has seemed relatively reasonable up to now but she finds herself turned on by crashes, stunt men, and the rest. When she and Spader are making love (this time in bed, not in the back seat), she asks about Koteas. Did you see his penis? Spader He says it's all scarred from a motorcycle accident. Unger ecstatically Ewwwww. Anyway, to get on with it, one thing leads to another -- one thing being crashes and the other being flaming death amidst twisted metal. What with everyone being swept up in the craze and wanting still more of the excitement, the only sensible way to arouse and satisfy your wife is to smash into her car and kill her, right? Two Big Os for the price of one -- Orgasm through Obliteration. So Spader continually rams the convertible driven by his willing wife until it flips over on the side of the highway. But she's not dead after all. I'm all right, she mumbles. Maybe next time. Maybe next time, he whispers to her and then does her bloody and half conscious body in the sere grass.So what's it all about, you ask? You might find that SOME people have no idea but I have a very firm answer. I don't know. At one point Spader asks Koteas why he's so interested in this stuff and Koteas replies portentously It's the reshaping of the human body by modern technology. Gosh.It's an awesome statement but what does it mean? How is modern technology reshaping the human body? Does he mean that vehicular accidents tear it all to bits? Is he somehow thinking of the Thighmaster or simulacrum that imitate rowing or cross-country skiing or walking upstairs? Is Cronenberg really after ROCK HARD ABS? Here's what I think he's up to.

It's certainly not a realistic portrayal of a bunch of perverts. Where could they possibly get insurance after the first dozen crashes? And the fear and sexual responses are antagonistic, the former mediated by the sympathetic nervous system and the latter by the parasympathetic.

Unger and Hunter and Roseanna Arquette are sexy and attractive women. (There's a homosexual encounter involving Spader and Koteas, but it's not sufficiently prolonged or explicit to be anhedonic.)

Somebody who jumps off a cliff might have a spontaneous ejaculation, a sympathetic reflex, but he's not going to have an erection.I don't mean to pan the movie entirely. Unger and Hunter and Roseanna Arquette are sexy and attractive women. (There's a homosexual encounter involving Spader and Koteas, but it's not sufficiently prolonged or explicit to be anhedonic.) At any randomly chosen moment, the screen will show cars on the highway, cars crashing, people having sex in cars, or people talking about cars crashing and people having sex in cars. And it's neatly directed too. What shiny metal and what frangible flesh! Everything but the bodies seem gleaming and cold.My only problem was that I didn't like it. Not my perversion.

I noticed other details within it, but it was still pretty much the same to me.Kathryn Bigelow never makes the same movie twice (Point Break, K-19 The Widowmaker), and she knows how to tell a story. But in this case, she almost seems to tell TWO stories that are more like two contrived paradoxes. The ending was quite long in terms of developing into something taut and mono-problematic. That's become quite a cinematic cliché' now (Die Hard anyone?), it's so boring to watch. Not to mention how Tom Sizemore explains the whole plan to Lenny- it seemed so shoe-horned in. And the dialogue would make me want to scratch my head, like it tries so hard to sound cool. Ralph Fiennes is okay, but he's always played classier characters that I couldn't see him as a scum like he was depicted to be. Juliette Lewis does a fair job and is her usual un-redeeming white-trash self; Angela Basset was a true bad-ass with a capital B. Tom Sizemore does a bland as vanilla job and his wig's just stupid. Michael Wincott, Glenn Plummer, Michael Jace, Belinda Bako, William Fichtner and Vincent D'onofrio are all good in their supporting roles.The predictions and the production design just with how the future would be presented five years from 1995 are pretty plausible. I like how the makers chose to let L.A. keep it's urban decay along with its idiosyncrasies. You see Lenny's Mercedes, and it looks like a model on the market in the late 1990s.

The scene where they recover the disc in the junkyard was tight, as well as the getaway. CALM DOWN BABY, THIS IS WHAT I DO!

We didn't need to see ALL the riffs in the club either, since the same music was heard at the end of the film in front of the Bonevencher. But still, the movie was watchable.There were unnecessary sub-plots with Max and telling them about the rumors of death squads and other things that made the movie drag. The film was also unclear with why Lenny was kicked off the police force. I heard that it was because he was a pedophile, and if that was the case, there would be no way that Angela Basset would go fifty feet near this man knowing that. Maybe he was dealing playback to people while a cop- like an entrepreneur. But what was interesting was the whole SQUIDD concept itself- and I can see how people could get addicted to watching or experiencing other's memories as a form of escapism. The fact that there is harm to the brain with it also makes it very plausible that it could be declared illegal.

Quentin Tarantino was executive producer, but clearly had no influence on the creative side of the movie. The presence of Tarantino's name on the Killing Zoe DVD is a double-ended sword; on the one hand, it's what made me notice it and pick it up in the first place, and I'm sure it helped a lot in the film's sales when it was first released. On the other, it inevitably creates some high expectations, and these can hinder your enjoyment from the movie, as they did mine.

It's a fast-paced, entertaining crime story with lots of violence, some sense of humor, some sex and a lot of atmosphere. Very good performances are also given by the beautiful Julie Delpy (the prostitute with a heart of gold) and Jean-Hugues Anglade (the psychopathic sadist), who plays one of the coolest villains of the 90's (who's more than a bit similar to Gary Oldman's fantastic Agent Stansfield from 'Leon'), and these two almost make up for the unimpressive leading man we have in Eric Stoltz &#150; who, though he made a fine career for himself playing small character roles in fantastic films from Pulp Fiction to Singles, had not proved himself as a capable lead since his breakthrough performance as a disfigured boy in Mask &#150; who plays a rather unlikable and uninteresting hero.Killing Zoe is a featherweight film with absolutely no depth to the story or characters, that generally likes waving around the sex and violence for the sake of sex and violence, which are sometimes unnecessarily excessive (like the far too long sex scene at the beginning, or the gory image of the dying man near the end); it's not a very intelligent crime movie, and it won't stick with you, but it's great entertainment, with fantastic atmosphere, and for any fan of the genre &#150; one who is not easily offended (and you'll be amazed at how dirty a dirty joke sounds in French even if you don't understand one word) - it's well worth seeing.

Several of them, like Full Metal Jacket, Platoon, and Apocalypse Now I consider to be true classics. I had heard many good things about The Deer Hunter, and thus I had quite high hopes. Unfortunately, my expectations were not met.The Deer Hunter focuses on how the Vietnam war changes the lives of three all-American friends, Niko (Christopher Walken), Michael (Robert DeNiro) and Steven (John Savage). They live relatively happy, normal lives in a small American town, then get sent to Vietnam, where they become heavily traumatized (to say the least) and upon returning to the USA, realize that nothing will ever be the same again.That's certainly a relevant and interesting story for a movie, and when The Deer Hunter first came out I can understand that it must have hit like a bomb since it dealt with a theme that most people weren't prepared to face just yet, and it does so in a pretty outspoken manner. More than twenty-five years later, though, I can't help but feel that it's not really such a good movie.The first problem is the pacing. The movie weighs in at about three hours, but there's just not enough happening to justify that running time. The director spends an inordinate amount of time on scenes that are merely meant to establish the atmosphere instead of developing story or characters. During many of the sequences, either nothing or something very mundane happens. Yes, I understand that the main characters are supposed to be normal American boys so many of the things they do are mundane, but Cimino is way overdoing it here.The slow pacing is even more jarring given the fact that the movie's story isn't told very well. It's not very coherent, there are some rather large leaps in time during which it's left totally unclear what happens to the characters, and some of the things make very little sense (e.g. Walken's character surviving dozens of games of Russian roulette...while that's not impossible, it's very very implausible). Some of the time spent on fleshing out the atmosphere could and should have been used to improve the flow of the story.That being said, the movie definitely isn't without its moments. The Russian roulette scenes are spine-chilling and really deserve the legendary status they have achieved. The acting by DeNiro and Walken is great as well, and the music is beautiful and fitting. Unfortunately, Meryl Streep and John Savage are a lot less convincing. Streep is melodrama at its worst here, and Savage overacts heavily, if you ask me.Finally, it's a bit of a shame that the movie takes such a one-sided look at the Vietnam war. It only looks at the effects of the atrocities committed by the VC on the Americans, not at the validity of the war as a whole or the role of the USA. You'd think that after being heavily traumatized, the three boys might at least become a bit angry with the USA for sending them into such a senseless war, but instead the United States are glorified in the cringe-inducing final scene. I understand that the time wasn't right for a real analysis of the Vietnam war, but the approach taken here (evil VCs traumatize innocent American boys) seems to be a bit too simplistic.So, in the end that leaves me very disappointed with this movie. While it's certainly a relevant movie about a relevant subject, I don't think that subject was handled all that well. A couple of brilliant scenes and some good acting IMHO fail to make up for a really slow pace, a so-so story, and a very one-sided look at the Vietnam war..**1\/2 out of ***** ","genre":null},{"date":"4 October 2005","score":"7 out of 13 people found the following review useful","review":" I generally like movies dealing with the Vietnam war.

Here we get one of the nerds, Curtis Armstrong but i suspect that he was merely in this movie to give it some clout, as the lead John Cusack wasn't really a household name yet. When you look at the movie Curtis Armstrong's screen time doesn't even amount to 5 minutes.The rest of the movie is sort of interesting because of the style of the first half which is kind of offbeat considering that Cusack's character, Lane is ten times more realistic than the rest of the characters. His mother, who cooks rather disgusting meals belongs in some kind of 50's sitcom and almost all her lines are written like she is talking to herself and not interacting with anybody else. And who could forget that pesky little paperboy who keeps showing up and demanding 2 dollars. That scene has almost been parodied to death on various spoofs through the 90's and 00's.The director, Savage Steve Holland, did not have a prolific career but you certainly can't deny that he made some movies out of the ordinary and I am glad that I can remember this as being one of the more satisfying experiences at the movies because usually 80's movies were extremely formulated. John Cusack may not have been a official member of what was known as the Brat Pack and this film certainly is a notch below the Breakfast Club. However, since he succeeded where they failed, I doubt that he lost much sleep over it.

All seems well at first. The house is enormous and beautiful, and the main attraction is the Panic Room, a room hidden in Jodie's bedroom. Layered into the wall with thick concrete and steel, there's no way into the Panic Room once the metal door has swung shut.And how convenient that Panic Room proves to be when three men invade their house on their first night moving in.

All they have is the few supplies stocked in the room and the advantage of seeing what the burglars are doing, for the house is rigged with video cameras and several monitors on the wall display each room to our heroines.Once inside, a tense and original game of cat and mouse plays out as the burglars reveal that they need to get into the Panic Room for a hidden treasure.

Chris Elliot shines in the role of Nathaniel Mayweather, a wealthy young man fresh out of finishing school, forced into a life at sea on a fishing boat with men not of his stature. Fine performances abound in this grand seafaring epic, including Brian Doyle-Murray as Skunk, Andy Richter as Kenny, Melora Walters as Trina, the swimmer who catches Nathaniel's heart, and Ann Magnuson as Calli, who cleans his pipes. Best of all is Ricki Lake with an astoundingly nuanced performance as The Filthy Whore's head. With rich cinematography, amazing special effects, and masterful direction by Adam Resnick (who also co-wrote the suspenseful and heartwarming screenplay with Elliot), this is one movie that you shouldn't miss if you're a fan of great seagoing adventure stories like The Odyssey and Captain's Courageous. It's easily one of the greatest movies of this or any other generation; if I could rate higher than 10\/10, I would do so with this one. The ending would make even the most hardened death row convict cry.

Its's not only a fair adaptation of the original book, it was also one of the biggest grossing motion pictures of 1934 and helped turn it's two leads, William Powell and Myrna Loy into Hollywood royalty.Having starred as detective Philo Vance in a series of Movie 'Murder Cases' William Powell was well versed in the sleuth genre, but in the ever serious and slightly square Vance, Powell was rather limited in the amount of characterisation he could use. What a joy it was therefore that Powell was able to show the lighter side of both Vance and himself in the ever lovable and witty character of Nick Charles.Charles is a retired but legendary private detective who for the last four years has lived a respectable life after marrying Nora, a wealthy heiress, played by the wonderful Myrna Loy. The two seem to have spent their marriage in a permanent state of intoxication, bought about not only by love but the copious amounts of alcohol they consume. For the first and possibly the only time in motion pictures we are presented with a couple of drunks who are both likable and inoffensive.Whilst on a Christmas Holiday in New York, Charles is approached by the daughter of Clyde Wynant a former client, who is worried as her father seems to have disappeared. Although reluctant at first to have anything to do with the case, he is forced to act when a the dead body of Wynant's girlfriend is discovered, and all the evidence points to Wynant as the murderer.Knowing Wynant, Nick is convinced he is not the killer, and after considerable brow beating by Nora, frequent visits from Wynant's family, an attempt on his life and increasing suspicion from the police, he reluctantly comes out of retirement to find the real killer himself.After suitable investigation and in true Agatha Christie style, Nick invites all the suspects to a black tie dinner party, and by explaining the whole saga from beginning to end he forces the murderers hand and unveils the killer right in the middle of the fish course. Wonderful Stuff.Sounds like a serious melodrama doesn't it, but believe me this film is a comedy through and through.In Nick and Nora, Powell and Loy create the perfect screen couple, always drinking, always making wise cracks at each other, in some sort of permanent game of oneupmanship but with all always completely happy. It was their performances which helped garnish this film with five sequels.Although Powell and Loy would also be paired together in several non- Thin Man movies, it is the characters of Nick and Nora Charles for which they will be best remembered.I love the scenes where he tries to get rid of Nora so she's not in the way...hilarious, and I love the way Nora tries to investigate matters herself always thinking shes giving the 'flatfoot' a run for his money.This is the original and the best of The Thin Man series, with so much wit and humour and just the right amount of suspense and mystery, The Thin man is a detective movie which pretty much set the mould for how movie detectives would be seen from that day forward.Special mention to Edward Ellis, who appears briefly as Clyde Wynant who in fact is the the title character, The Thin Man himself, although the legend would be applied to all Nick and Nora Charles' movie adventures, this is the only film in which he appears.
