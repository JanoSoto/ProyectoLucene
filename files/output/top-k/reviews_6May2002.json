As the opening credits were playing, I was sitting there muttering to myself please don't suck... please don't suck...  I went into the movie with VERY high hopes, but also with a foreboding feeling that I was going to be highly disappointed as I was with Dungeons & Dragons, LOTR and some other movie I went to see but don't remember what it was because it wasn't worth it.Spiderman has ALWAYS been my #1 favorite superhero.  I had Spidey underoos as a kid, whatched the cartoon religiously, and collected all sorts of spidey stuff when I was old enough to afford it.I've read a lot of comments on the movie here, and both sides bring out good points, but a lot of people just missed the whole point to the movie.Sam Raimi is one of my favorite directors.  He does a really outstanding job on movies without having the budget that names like Ron Howard, Stephen Spielburg and George Lucas commands.  I saw an interview with Sam on TV last week and he was scared that true Spidey fans would despise him forever on doing a hack job, but was confident that the movie would work out well. Which it did.Tobey who?  Never heard of him.  The first thing I ever saw him on was the Letterman show where he sat there and kept getting irritated at Dave for making fun of him and the movie.  Unfortunately, I had that distaste of him when I did go in, but I think he pulled it off quite well.  The only other person I could think of (and this was YEARS ago) who may have had a better run as Spiderman would have been the late Brandon Lee... but he was almost too much of a pretty boy to effectively play a nerdy type.Willem Dafoe is a great actor who was handed a cheesy role.  I just don't mean for the movie, but in general.  Jack Nicholson had to pull off the Joker, which he did.. Willem pulled off the GG.  I wasn't too wild about the biosuit and agree with another viewer comment that it made him look like a Power Rangers bad guy, but what the heck.Kirsten was ok as MJ.  I love that she called him Tiger... but just that once.  That was perfect.  The upside down kiss was perfect.  The gratuitous wet t-shirt shot was impressive.  I think she had more chemistry with Aunt May than Peter and uncle Ben, but unfortunately, Cliff and Tobey didn't have enough time to really do too much.The special effects worried me... I loved the web-slinging shots.. for the most part they were impressive and really fed my acrophobia.  A few times some of the CG was... painful.All in all... outstanding job.  The changes from movie to comic were minimal and allowed smooth transitions.  Back when spidey came out, radioactive everything was the huge news.  Nowadays, it's genetics.  Next movie, let's get some more wisecracks in there, and I would positively die if we get to see Venom and Carnage at some point... that was one of the most trying times in the life of Peter Parker, and contrary to what some of the people here think, Spiderman isn't about actionadventureshootemupandbeatupallthebadguys. Spiderman has a much more human element to it.I hope Sam Raimi and the cast keep up the great work.  The sequel is going to have to be twice as good as the first, otherwise people will be even more critical than they are now.  Clean up the CG, a little bit more character development and interaction and let's let Spidey do a few more wisecracks. Good luck trying to make a Doc Oc or Rhino (especially one that doesn't look like a high school mascot).  And stay away from the Spidey\/X-Men union stuff.  Yuck.

In turn, he has made enough money to live without ever having to really THINK about money. But this Episode of the Star Wars saga has a different tone to it then all the others. In the original trilogy, Lucas handed over the directorial reigns because of the difficulty he didnt not wish to repeat when Star Wars was made. With this prequel trilogy, the first film was seen as part galant attempt to prepare the balances for the characters to come but as some critics would easily let you know, to 'cash in' on the box office star wars madness. But Attack Of The Clones, despite the slightly silly nature of the title, delivers in less the money making sense, and more in the character driven sense. Each character in this movie has two sides. Padme Amidala is both leader and fragile lady, Anakin is both destined for greatness and confusion and obviously Palpatine is not all he seems. It was a shame the character of Count Dooku did not appear in the first film to add some consistency, but never the less, Lee is at his best, firmly set in stone once again. As an admirer of the works of Alec Guiness, I incredibly enjoyed Ewan McGregor portrayal of the young mentor of Anakin. With this saga, we watch Obi-Wan turn from learner, to young (and weakened) teacher, to hero, to wise old sage and then immortal (of sorts). It is easy to see how Lucas will turn Obi Wan in too the great character portrayed by Guiness in Episode IV. With Luke, he tries not to make the same mistakes twice. Its a shame the third movie will have to cover so much ground (the Jedi Purge, Windu's death, the hiding of the twins) and mostly likely have a time jump in the middle. And although Lucas has already filmed the ending of this prequel series in Tunisia, one can only hope that this set of films can stand by themselves, not as a prologue to the events of Luke's life, but as a moral message, which shows a somewhat innocent fall into corruption, so that his son can redeem him.

At the same time, there is an on-going theme of the dance, the Charleston, winding its way through claustrophobic ship corridors.  The characters are the powerful Hollywood producers, and William Randolph Hearst (W.R., or sometimes Willie), mistresses, would-be mistresses, and some writers, all real people, although the events are only a guess.  The characters seem to be play-acting - badly - at spontenaity; W.R. is unable to follow the dance for more than a few minutes.  And yet, there is a kind of Seventh-Seal St. Vitus dance quality about the movie, and one asks, is it all a little passion play?  Make-believe?  Or a planned chess game with the devil?  The play acting becomes more and more real, and even scenes such as a ping-pong game between two minor characters begins to take on a very sinister atmosphere.Less obvious than Bergman, Bogdonavitch shows us a kind of plague, and there is death to go with it.  One of the writers observes that Hollywood itself is a demon, and those who live there lose all morals and all direction. She later observes that without the superficiality of the Charleston dance, there is nothing to connect the people, and that the relationships are meaningless.  It is almost an admission that the romantic connections are only a cover for a coldly planned crime.Orsen Wells, not a character in the movie, was one of those who whispered this plot.  Perhaps he heard the tale from Chaplin.  One can almost hear these whispers coming down through the years; did Bergman also hear these whispers at some point, and the Seventh Seal actually copy from this original event?  Chaplin would have had the intelligence to see some of what was going on, but he might have been too disturbed by the implications to convey all of it.  (Wells and Chaplin did work together on a movie about a bluebeard who murdered his wives.  Chaplin played in, Wells directed.)Thomas Ince had been one of the few who had made movies about real Native Americans using real Native American actors, and was not as much of a xenophobe as some of the other rich Hollywood moghuls.  The party on the boat was Ince's birthday party, but one asks, if W.R. is unwilling to make a business deal with him, then why would Ince have been invited as guest of honor, or if invited by Marion Davies, why would W.R. have attended?  W.R. himself is shown as perhaps a bigot, although that is only a minor moment in the film; but it is the bigoted attitudes of his newspapers and columnists such as Louella Parsons which prove W.R.'s ongoing bigotry.  This seems like a thin motive for murder, but there is certainly more to this plot than a romantic plot, or else one wouldn't find newspapers and magazines even today revealing the movie plot and dismissing this movie out of hand.  Is there still something to hide?  Is news being fed to us that is false, and these newspapers or press feeds still want to cover that up?  Was there a property ownership issue that still might be questioned?  All of these questions might have been brought up by Bogdonovitch (especially the issue of Ince's Indian films), but Bogdonovitch does show W.R. coldly killing seagulls for no reason, and that leads one to think that W.R. was practicing for later... And, they just conveniently land near San Diego, etc.  All very neat, all too planned, alibi's and oaths in place, and who could have cooked up these alibi's and oaths in the heat of passion or in traumatic shock?Why would Charlie have been invited if he had already been noticed as following Marion Davies around, unless W.R. had decided that a little romantic play might distract people from the real plan.  Was a man as paranoid as W.R., and also able to call on any reporter in the entire U.S., unaware of the goings' on of Marion Davies?The acting in this movie is worth the trip, even if one doesn't wish to meditate on the plot's implications.  Like Gosford Park, the drama is about rich a-moral people, and the terrible results of their a-morality are brought out by the end.  Some of the characters do not seem as sleezy as they have been made out to be by tabloids, but the restraint shown by Bogdonovitch goes with a more probable Chaplin than tabloids illustrated. Chaplin was, after all, a powerful writer, actor, director, producer, composer as well as a ladies'man, and he had a terrific, not only a beautiful, head on his shoulders.  The superficial party goers are at least shown to have some humanity.I wish this film had much wider distribution.  It has only now arrived in my area of the country in an art film house.

Being someone who loves animals, I rented Ace Ventura When Nature Calls and Dr. Dolittle 2 just for the heck of it (the former because I think Jim Carrey is hilarious but had avoided that particular title out of fear of it being a disappointment, the latter because I was interested in seeing the talking animal effects).  After loving the first title far better than expected, I had the pleasure of writing it up with compliments here for other IMDb readers.Dr. Dolittle 2, however, was a flop for me.Now, I do have to admit that I was basically prepared to be disappointed for this one the same way I was with When Nature Calls. I grew up with the beloved original Dr. Dolittle movie starring the talented Rex Harrison and adored the original books. I was absolutely convinced that this movie would be a dumb attempt to cash in on the original and make it marketable and hip in that lousy, gross-out way that only Hollywood marketing executives can when digging for dollars. But I watched it anyway, hoping that I could at least enjoy the talking animals, and I would have been spared a lot of headaches if only someone had been around to talk me out of this temporary lapse of better judgement.Let me start by saying that this movie has nothing to do with the original concept. Nothing. The animals talk and the main character has a famous name along with the ability to understand them, and it's there that any similarities end.How bad was this film? Let me put it this way it was a heap worse than I had anticipated, so much so that I shut it off two-thirds of the way in. It was simply too much of an embarrassment, and I found myself plotting to return it in the middle of the night after work when Blockbuster would be closed so no one would see me carrying it!The absolute worst problem with this film has to do with Eddie Murphy himself--a strong reminder of why he didn't have a hit film for something going on a decade. Simply put, he isn't likeable he plays this role the precise same way he has played nearly all of his roles, as an obnoxious Why do I have to be stuck in this position, I wish I was doing something else better with my time jerk who merely puts up with his dilemma. He also seems so ANNOYED in most of his movies.In the grossly overrated Beverly Hills Cop films, he was an annoyed cop who had to have everything his own way. In The Golden Child, he was an annoyed locator of missing children who put up with his job as well as his mission simply because he was stuck with it. Except for the occasional Mulan (the only performance of his I liked, by the way), he always whines, snarls, screams, curses and is generally pessimistic. And in this film, he is annoyed at the mere idea of being the world's most unique animal doctor.Eddie Murphy has managed to accomplish the impossible here--he has actually managed to make the idea of being able to talk to animals into a thoroughly unenjoyable and miserable routine. Simply put, he takes all the fun out of such a concept.What child HASN'T wanted to talk to animals? It was the one thing I wished I could do for as long as I could remember. If given the choice of any one magical ability (even if I were to include the ability to fly in a would-be list to choose from), it would easily be being able to converse with animals. But here, you get the impression that God simply plopped this amazing talent on precisely the wrong individual. Murphy doesn't even seem to genuinely *care* about animals--it's all an Okay, okay, I'll do it, but only because I feel like I have to and not because I have any heart for it sort of arrangement for him. All the while, what with that expression on his face, you keep expecting him to mutter, God, why ME? This is such a pain in the NECK!!! And in this attitude while conversing with the various animals on screen, he does everything except slap them with his I'm always right, so you'd better listen to me sharpness.There is something seriously wrong with a script when Dr. Dolittle is overly annoyed in dealing with, much more so being the only person on the planet able to talk to, animals.Here's my say if this material had to be remade at all, it should have at least been given to a comedian who could have worked wonders with its concept and genuinely enjoyed it. Imagine Robin Williams, or Steve Martin, or (you guessed it) even Carrey himself portraying this role. Heck, even the late John Candy. Any of them as well as dozens of others could have made this work because they have something which Murphy has always lacked--a sense of lightheartedness and joy when given the opportunity to work with fantastical and outlandish material.Watching this dreck, though, I seriously get the impression that Eddie Murphy picked the project simply because he knows he had nearly killed his own career with portraying annoyingly selfish, self-centered bores and wanted to do something to change his image into something lighter in an attempt to save it. Or at least his agent did. Whatever. All I have to say is--Eddie, if you want to convince us you can do something fun then you need to lighten yourself up first. Talking animal effects and potty humour do no automatically make you a whiz at family entertainment. Basically, you're just doing your same old Beverly Hills Cop personality routine with gimmicky windowdressing, and it doesn't work.But such a long review on my behalf was far better than this film deserves. If it weren't for the fact that I wanted to share my feelings on it with others, I would have otherwise simply written one line here I'll pass on this movie.

If given the choice of any one magical ability (even if I were to include the ability to fly in a would-be list to choose from), it would easily be being able to converse with animals.

Imagine Robin Williams, or Steve Martin, or (you guessed it) even Carrey himself portraying this role. Heck, even the late John Candy. Any of them as well as dozens of others could have made this work because they have something which Murphy has always lacked--a sense of lightheartedness and joy when given the opportunity to work with fantastical and outlandish material.Watching this dreck, though, I seriously get the impression that Eddie Murphy picked the project simply because he knows he had nearly killed his own career with portraying annoyingly selfish, self-centered bores and wanted to do something to change his image into something lighter in an attempt to save it. Or at least his agent did. Whatever. All I have to say is--Eddie, if you want to convince us you can do something fun then you need to lighten yourself up first. Talking animal effects and potty humour do no automatically make you a whiz at family entertainment.

","genre":"Comedy, Family, Fantasy"},{"date":"6 May 2002","score":"","review":"  A couple of nights ago, I rented two movies at my local Blockbuster Video out of curiosity. Being someone who loves animals, I rented Ace Ventura When Nature Calls and Dr. Dolittle 2 just for the heck of it (the former because I think Jim Carrey is hilarious but had avoided that particular title out of fear of it being a disappointment, the latter because I was interested in seeing the talking animal effects).  After loving the first title far better than expected, I had the pleasure of writing it up with compliments here for other IMDb readers.Dr. Dolittle 2, however, was a flop for me.Now, I do have to admit that I was basically prepared to be disappointed for this one the same way I was with When Nature Calls. I grew up with the beloved original Dr. Dolittle movie starring the talented Rex Harrison and adored the original books. I was absolutely convinced that this movie would be a dumb attempt to cash in on the original and make it marketable and hip in that lousy, gross-out way that only Hollywood marketing executives can when digging for dollars. But I watched it anyway, hoping that I could at least enjoy the talking animals, and I would have been spared a lot of headaches if only someone had been around to talk me out of this temporary lapse of better judgement.Let me start by saying that this movie has nothing to do with the original concept. Nothing. The animals talk and the main character has a famous name along with the ability to understand them, and it's there that any similarities end.How bad was this film? Let me put it this way it was a heap worse than I had anticipated, so much so that I shut it off two-thirds of the way in. It was simply too much of an embarrassment, and I found myself plotting to return it in the middle of the night after work when Blockbuster would be closed so no one would see me carrying it!The absolute worst problem with this film has to do with Eddie Murphy himself--a strong reminder of why he didn't have a hit film for something going on a decade. Simply put, he isn't likeable he plays this role the precise same way he has played nearly all of his roles, as an obnoxious Why do I have to be stuck in this position, I wish I was doing something else better with my time jerk who merely puts up with his dilemma. He also seems so ANNOYED in most of his movies.In the grossly overrated Beverly Hills Cop films, he was an annoyed cop who had to have everything his own way. In The Golden Child, he was an annoyed locator of missing children who put up with his job as well as his mission simply because he was stuck with it. Except for the occasional Mulan (the only performance of his I liked, by the way), he always whines, snarls, screams, curses and is generally pessimistic.

He also has spent an incredible amount of time with the personal trainers and that showed.  I for one will willingly back him for the sequels and hope that we don't have a fiasco similar to Batman with the actor changing each film. Willem Dafoe is probably the weakest link in the movie and that is more from the writing of his character than how he does.  I think that at times they made his acting a tad too comic-bookish if you will but that really wouldn't be his fault. I approached this movie with a certain amount of trepidation and yet enthusiastically.

So let me preface this review with a bit of videostore-geek advice if you did NOT see the first BLADE, rent that. If you have not seen or heard of CRONOS or MIMIC (the first one), hunt those down and rent them, too, if possible. If any of the aforementioned films is not your cuppa blood, go see THE SWEETEST THING, LIFE OR SOMETHING LIKE IT or ICE AGE. Stay as far away from BLADE 2 as your local multraplex will allow.Now, that THAT'S out of the way, how was the movie? As sequels go, I've definitely seen better. As sequels directed by Guillermo del Toro rate, it was nothing less than AMAZING. As with most Marvel\/DC-oriented superhero film franchises these days, you always have to begin with the story of the hero's origins, and Stephen Norrington did a more-than-capable job of providing us with that in the first BLADE.  Not a whole lot of character development, (but then what were you expecting, people? For God's sake, it's based on a COMIC BOOK!!)  but Blade's origins, his mission and his relationship with Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), were firmly established.With the preliminaries out of the way, it was time for a director to step in, who leaves his mark on a film in a way that few others can, and del Toro definitely ranks among the top twenty in this category. If you have seen any of his other work, you already know that whether the script is a sensation or a stink bomb, he still interprets it in his own unique way. To wit you don't go to a movie by David Lynch or Oliver Stone expecting to see HEIDI THE MUSICAL; you won't get that here, either.With a penchant for painting pictures more with darkness than light, a fondness for the supernatural and all the oozy, slimy, slitheriness that goes with it, and an obsession with unearthing the ultraviolent subtext so obviously begging for further exploration in its predecessor, del Toro's BLADE 2 takes the audience and David S. Goyer's script, and shakes them both like a pit bull whose Kibble was recently laced with PCP.Now that he's had a chance to get comfortable with the character, Wesley Snipes now walks and talks Blade as if he created the Daywalker himself, and much like Sean Connery as 007, you'll never be able to picture anyone else making the feeble attempt to essay the role in his place after this. Those looking for stunning dialogue and deeply constructed plot points had better look elsewhere; the plot here is all about providing every opportunity for Blade to kick undead ass, and he does so with a gusto I wish half the other working actors in Hollywood would bring to their roles in A-list pictures.The story is thankfully very simple, and it wisely tackles the question on everyone's mind from the opening frames if Whistler died in the first installment, what is he doing back in the sequel? After failing to take his own life and being captured by Blade's enemies, the Daywalker has been following his trail for a few years, bent on destroying those who kidnapped Whistler, and determined to bring an end to his mentor's suffering.He finally tracks Whistler to Prague (good for the mythic locale and also the producers, since it's much cheaper to shoot there), where instead of outright killing the old vampire hunter, he helps cure him of his condition, assisted more or less by a new punky sidekick named Scud, (Norman Reedus, who channels David Arquette at his least quirky\/annoying).No sooner does the reunion take place, than an elite vampire squad finds the new hideout. Strangely enough, though, they're not here to eradicate Blade and company; they want to strike a bargain. It seems a new, mutant strain of bloodsuckers has somehow evolved, and their primary goal is to drain, infect or destroy all life on the planet, both vampire and human. The pure-bred vamps want to enlist Blade's help to stop the scourge, and there you have it.Del Toro, who has a fondness for the themes of vampirism and the more unhealthy symbiotic aspects of man's dependence upon his technology and vice-versa, could not have been able to resist the opportunities this script must have presented, and he doesn't miss a trick here. Though the fight scenes could be categorized as fantasy violence, he presents the set-pieces here with all the finesse and style of an EVIL DEAD remake with Jet Li as the star, scored with the sound of depth charges going off. The choreography is as sharp-edged as anything you've seen in THE MATRIX or CROUCHING TIGER, and the gore as prevalent and pustulent as a book of H.R. Giger's unused ideas for ALIEN or SPECIES.  The makeup and visuals departments get to have a field day, especially with some biological traits displayed by the mutant vampires, that will have you wishing you'd skipped dinner before the movie.One of the most outstanding special effects on display, however, isn't even a prop or a visual. Del Toro and other directors of his caliber, (like Jean-Pierre Jeunet) all share a fondness for using one incredible actor Ron Perlman. The former BEAUTY AND THE BEAST-star has one of the most recognizable anti-leading man mugs in cinematic history; he makes Kristofferson look like the next GQ cover by comparison. And Perlman is nearly peerless in his fearless dedication to a full exploration of how the most unsavory of characters is motivated, (with strong runners-up being the likes of Nicholson, Walken, Hopper and Woods).Which is how he nearly walks away with the movie as Reinhardt, the leader of the elite Bloodpack charged to help Blade hunt down the mutant vamps' leader (as opposed to their original mission, which was to hunt down and kill Blade.) A vampire with a fascist outlook and bloodsucker-supremacist leanings? What a truly sick, original idea. And what a magnificent opportunity for an actor of Perlman's gifts to pull it off. Only someone with Snipes daunting ability for manifesting his physical presence on-screen, could even hope not to be overshadowed, and their physical and verbal sparring matches make you wish that del Toro had made room for more such moments throughout the movie.Thomas Kretschmann and Luke Goss are impressive as the main antagonists of the piece, and Leonor Varela as the comely non-mutant vamp Nyssa kicks butt with the best of the guys, but is given little to do otherwise, especially in a painfully underdeveloped romantic subplot involving Blade, which rings really false later in the finale, shot as beautifully as a Calvin Klein commercial directed by Anne Rice, and carrying about as much emotional weight.If an all-out mega-assault on your senses is what you're looking for, BLADE is more than happy to oblige. But unlike similarly CGI-rich gorefests like RESIDENT EVIL, this one has one badass Daywalker to keep it (and the audience) riveted and reasonably centered amidst the chaotic designer mayhem.And besides, where else can you hear an actor tackle a line like You want us to spray ourselves with some suckpuppy's nut-juice? with a totally straight face, and make it believable, even as you chortle at the purple outlandishness of the dialogue?

After failing to take his own life and being captured by Blade's enemies, the Daywalker has been following his trail for a few years, bent on destroying those who kidnapped Whistler, and determined to bring an end to his mentor's suffering.He finally tracks Whistler to Prague (good for the mythic locale and also the producers, since it's much cheaper to shoot there), where instead of outright killing the old vampire hunter, he helps cure him of his condition, assisted more or less by a new punky sidekick named Scud, (Norman Reedus, who channels David Arquette at his least quirky\/annoying).No sooner does the reunion take place, than an elite vampire squad finds the new hideout. Strangely enough, though, they're not here to eradicate Blade and company; they want to strike a bargain. It seems a new, mutant strain of bloodsuckers has somehow evolved, and their primary goal is to drain, infect or destroy all life on the planet, both vampire and human. The pure-bred vamps want to enlist Blade's help to stop the scourge, and there you have it.Del Toro, who has a fondness for the themes of vampirism and the more unhealthy symbiotic aspects of man's dependence upon his technology and vice-versa, could not have been able to resist the opportunities this script must have presented, and he doesn't miss a trick here. Though the fight scenes could be categorized as fantasy violence, he presents the set-pieces here with all the finesse and style of an EVIL DEAD remake with Jet Li as the star, scored with the sound of depth charges going off. The choreography is as sharp-edged as anything you've seen in THE MATRIX or CROUCHING TIGER, and the gore as prevalent and pustulent as a book of H.R. Giger's unused ideas for ALIEN or SPECIES.  The makeup and visuals departments get to have a field day, especially with some biological traits displayed by the mutant vampires, that will have you wishing you'd skipped dinner before the movie.One of the most outstanding special effects on display, however, isn't even a prop or a visual. Del Toro and other directors of his caliber, (like Jean-Pierre Jeunet) all share a fondness for using one incredible actor Ron Perlman. The former BEAUTY AND THE BEAST-star has one of the most recognizable anti-leading man mugs in cinematic history; he makes Kristofferson look like the next GQ cover by comparison. And Perlman is nearly peerless in his fearless dedication to a full exploration of how the most unsavory of characters is motivated, (with strong runners-up being the likes of Nicholson, Walken, Hopper and Woods).Which is how he nearly walks away with the movie as Reinhardt, the leader of the elite Bloodpack charged to help Blade hunt down the mutant vamps' leader (as opposed to their original mission, which was to hunt down and kill Blade.) A vampire with a fascist outlook and bloodsucker-supremacist leanings? What a truly sick, original idea. And what a magnificent opportunity for an actor of Perlman's gifts to pull it off. Only someone with Snipes daunting ability for manifesting his physical presence on-screen, could even hope not to be overshadowed, and their physical and verbal sparring matches make you wish that del Toro had made room for more such moments throughout the movie.Thomas Kretschmann and Luke Goss are impressive as the main antagonists of the piece, and Leonor Varela as the comely non-mutant vamp Nyssa kicks butt with the best of the guys, but is given little to do otherwise, especially in a painfully underdeveloped romantic subplot involving Blade, which rings really false later in the finale, shot as beautifully as a Calvin Klein commercial directed by Anne Rice, and carrying about as much emotional weight.If an all-out mega-assault on your senses is what you're looking for, BLADE is more than happy to oblige. But unlike similarly CGI-rich gorefests like RESIDENT EVIL, this one has one badass Daywalker to keep it (and the audience) riveted and reasonably centered amidst the chaotic designer mayhem.And besides, where else can you hear an actor tackle a line like You want us to spray ourselves with some suckpuppy's nut-juice? with a totally straight face, and make it believable, even as you chortle at the purple outlandishness of the dialogue?  ","genre":"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"6 May 2002","score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  Contains Spoilers First of all, not to insult some people's intelligence, but after reading about half of the reviews for BLADE 2, it was more than a little obvious that a lot of you haven't the slightest idea who the hell Guillermo del Toro is. So let me preface this review with a bit of videostore-geek advice if you did NOT see the first BLADE, rent that. If you have not seen or heard of CRONOS or MIMIC (the first one), hunt those down and rent them, too, if possible. If any of the aforementioned films is not your cuppa blood, go see THE SWEETEST THING, LIFE OR SOMETHING LIKE IT or ICE AGE. Stay as far away from BLADE 2 as your local multraplex will allow.Now, that THAT'S out of the way, how was the movie? As sequels go, I've definitely seen better. As sequels directed by Guillermo del Toro rate, it was nothing less than AMAZING. As with most Marvel\/DC-oriented superhero film franchises these days, you always have to begin with the story of the hero's origins, and Stephen Norrington did a more-than-capable job of providing us with that in the first BLADE.  Not a whole lot of character development, (but then what were you expecting, people? For God's sake, it's based on a COMIC BOOK!!)  but Blade's origins, his mission and his relationship with Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), were firmly established.With the preliminaries out of the way, it was time for a director to step in, who leaves his mark on a film in a way that few others can, and del Toro definitely ranks among the top twenty in this category. If you have seen any of his other work, you already know that whether the script is a sensation or a stink bomb, he still interprets it in his own unique way. To wit you don't go to a movie by David Lynch or Oliver Stone expecting to see HEIDI THE MUSICAL; you won't get that here, either.With a penchant for painting pictures more with darkness than light, a fondness for the supernatural and all the oozy, slimy, slitheriness that goes with it, and an obsession with unearthing the ultraviolent subtext so obviously begging for further exploration in its predecessor, del Toro's BLADE 2 takes the audience and David S. Goyer's script, and shakes them both like a pit bull whose Kibble was recently laced with PCP.Now that he's had a chance to get comfortable with the character, Wesley Snipes now walks and talks Blade as if he created the Daywalker himself, and much like Sean Connery as 007, you'll never be able to picture anyone else making the feeble attempt to essay the role in his place after this.

The showing was for a large group of theater owners to get them excited over the film.MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!      MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!Attack of the Clones starts out with an explosion of a boomerang shaped Naboo starship and an attempt on former Queen, now senator Padme Amidala. The film, after an exciting chase on airspeeders, through the vast openness of Corescant breaks down into two seperate sections, Anakin traveling with Padme to protect her from potential assassins, and Obi-Wan sent by the Jedi Council to investigate the recents attempts on Padme's life. One of the things that make this prequel far better than The Phantom Menace is that the storyline is designed for a more mature audience, as much of the kiddie humor is eliminated as Anakin is now more fully grown as a Jedi Apprentice.There are even some nods to the classic trilogy, (Obi-Wan slicing off a bounty hunter's arm in a Corescant bar, a chase in an asteroid field above the surface of Coruscant, etc) I also like how much more fully developed the characters are in this film as compared to Episode One, instead of a whining, pouting Obi-Wan Kenobi, as a Jedi Apprentice, we see this character better developed into a younger version of the old wise Jedi Knight that we all know and love from the classic trilogy. Even though Anakin has replaced Obi-Wan as the whiny Jedi apprentice this time.Some parts of the film still get quite silly though as the romantic elements could have been better written, I mean, I realize that Anakin and Padme are supposed to fall in love so that they can produce both Luke and Leia, from the classic trilogy as their children, but instead of a mature romance, Lucas goes for a usual teenage romance with many of the same consequences and bickering. The sequence where Anakin and Padme share time on a Naboo lake can get quite irritating to watch as it disrupts the flow created by some of the earlier action sequences. The scenes with Anakin and Padme on Naboo talking about politics and their course in life, in my opinion was the weakest part of the film. Those scenes just really slowed things down quite a bit. Plus, yes, folks Jar Jar Binks IS in the film as a bumbling senator with much of his juvenille dialoge attached, forunately, his scenes are brief, and his vote on an important scene in the senate shows the important element he is to this film. Also, this may sound a little too picky, but as watching the movie I couldn't help but notice that the characters from The Phantom Menace (Obi-Wan, Padme, Mace Windu, etc.) don't look much older than they did in that film. However, Anakin looks a lot older in the film as it takes place ten years after the events in The Phantom Menace, which is another small problem that bothered me from time to time as I was watching this.Obi-Wan then begins his investigation into the attempts on Padme's life on a watery planet called Kamino the source of the Clones in the film. (The special effects in this sequence make the rainstorms in The Perfect Storm look outdated by comparassion!)We begin to see Anakin's turn to the dark side as something dreadful happens to his mother and the actions that he takes in revenge. This is a very emotional scene and will bring chills to the audience.Which finally leads to the all-out battle action sequence on the planet Genossis, where hundreds of Jedi battle all sorts of battle droids and Genosians, (who look like tall walking\/flying grasshoppers with weird laser guns), Another thing which slightly disappointed me was the lack of a major space battle at the end making this the first Star Wars film of the saga to not end with a major space battle of some sort.In short, Lucas has more than made up from the downfalls and mistakes displayed in Episode One, and this time has thankfully returned to the fun and excitement displayed in the films of the classic trilogy! The audience of theater owners gave the film a loud applause after the credits ended and many of them cheerfully stated that Attack of the Clones was really the film that episode one SHOULD have been. My faith in the Star Wars saga has cheerfully returned after many years.The performances are much better than those in The Phantom Menace, Heyden Christensen makes a much better Anakin than the bratty, Jake Lloyd.

Whether it's genre driven films such as the Evil Dead series or the recent Spider-Man he has a very good sense of the films he's making. Of his more serious recent films such as A Simple Plan and For the Love of the Game, I think The Gift, his last serious effort before Spider-Man, stands out as the best. The film has a few faults however so I just want to get those out of the way. Some of the characters aren't developed enough so we lose interest in them quite quickly. Also the outcome is quite obvious early on in the film, so a few more twist to maybe keep the audiences guessing would've been appreciated. Other than that however we have a pretty well made picture so these minor flaws don't overshadow an otherwise brilliant production. First and foremost this is a character driven piece lead by the incredible Cate Blanchet. She is quite the chameleon in her movies. She can go from playing Queen Elizabeth, to a southern fortune teller without skipping a beat. Her talent is something that most performers should strive for. She's very efficent in her part here. She's very likable and she makes you feel for her character. Giovanni Ribisi is also very good in the film. He could've played it like the stereotypical crazy person but he brings something new to the role. We feel for him because he brings his struggle across so well when he's on screen. Hillary Swank is good also but her character is majorly underdeveloped. She falls into stereotypical battered wife mode but I did like her performance. I just wish she was given more to do. Keanu Reeves was such a shock in this film I never took him seriously as an actor until I saw this. He literally scared me at certain moments in the film. He brings such a realistic intensity to the role that he becomes more frightening. Greg Kinnear is ok in this film His character suffers from lack of development as well. I'm also tired of him playing the nice guy in films. It's getting a little old. His southern accent also isn't very consistent. Kept coming in and out. It's hard for me to buy he and Katie Holmes as an item but I guess it worked for the filmmakers. Speaking of Katie Holmes, props to her for taking on a more adult role. *SPOILER. It's not even the fact that she shows us her breasts but it's the fact that she's playing against type and does it fairly well. She has minimal screentime but she makes an impression.

I have heard this got bad ratings and i didn't know what to expect, but like I said if you really haven't followed the other 9 over the years then you'll get some people that thought it wasn't good, this is definitely a different kind of movie, one I don't think you can really just criticize like any other movie, If you like the other 9 chapters, you obviously do understand and put up with the Jason drowning as a boy\/ time to get revenge story line, you'll like this one, I give it a 10 and will definitely add it to the other 9, in the old vault of F13'S.

I have to give credit to the film for the fact that I saw both Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal before hand, and so naturally I was exceedingly unhappy with the Hannibal in this movie.  The plot wasn't even what I'd been lead to believe.  (To me - for some simillarities are uncanny except for the obvious things) Silence of the Lambs couldn't have been more simillar if two different people had written the story.  I don't think that I liked the acting, and I certainly disliked the plot.  Still, I'll see the remake with Anthony when it's out.  I'll give the plot another chance.  But not the man who played Lector. ","genre":null},{"date":"6 May 2002","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  I saw this movie not too long ago.

This movie, however, is the worst piece of crap to ever be projected onto the big screen. The action sequences go by too quickly, seem more unrealistic than they should, and never let us get a feel for Spider-Man himself. Where are his smart-a** wisecracks? Tobey Maguire does a good enough job with Parker, but the only person (I thought) who had the potential to save the movie was Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin. And what's up with the whole Peter's been in love with Mary Jane since he was 6? Parker didn't even meet MJ until college. The whole love plot was too sappy, too Hollywood...they made Spider-Man a chick flick! And I'm a chick, and I still hated it! What happened, Raimi??? That's the basic problem with all of the movie-- it was too Hollywood. It was like any other action movie. It's like Raimi just took parts from all the good action movies and put them together. There was nothing new, nothing creative, nothing to get into. During the movie, I never cared about Parker, Aunt May, Uncle Ben, MJ, Harry, and barely cared about Norman. And I really wanted to care about them, b\/c I had high expectations for the movie. It turned out to be the biggest theatrical disappoint of my life. Well, besides Woo.
