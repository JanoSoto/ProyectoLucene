The plot is almost non-existent and if there is one it's bizarre. It's not even slightly scary and I'm not sure if it even tries to be, it's easily the worst in a genuinely good series. The Leatherface is awfully played, more or less everyone can't act to save their lives, the two leads excluded. There is no actual massacre nor any chainsaw related deaths. So thats all the bad stuff out the way.Now the on the plus side, there is one thing. Matthew McConaughey. The first time I saw it I was stunned by his performance in it. He's really good. Very menacing and maniacal. Also Renee gives a decent performance as the sprightly young heroine.This film does have the power to annoy though. Oh my god my torch has run out I know, You two go and follow the mysterious car....I'll wander about in the woods with what is possibly the worst torch in existence...Oop..It's broke.The ending however, is the real cherry on top which makes most people I know hate it. No kind of sense has been made so far but I'm working on it. Where did that plane come from, why did it kill Vilmer, who to him, must've looked like he was also being chased by a man with the chainsaw. So was it all some kind of cult? Why have the police not seen this place? It's not that far from a school let alone civilisation like the original was. Funny how this school where they travel about a mile from is right next to a huge desert too. The list of plot holes could go on....but if you can get past the awful acting, irritating plot, hate-able characters (which is a good thing I guess) and the fact it makes no sense, you might just enjoy yourself. Just watch the two leads and enjoy (kind of).

Overall, this is a very entertaining movie, one of the best kids' films I've ever seen. Once Matthew Broderick is turned into Inspector Gadget, the film becomes very inventive with a lot of cool gadgets and a lot of neat things to see and hear (great movie for surround sound.)Broderick is a likable hero and even Rupert Everett as the villain is, too, producing some laughs. There are enough adult-type jokes to clever material to make this fun for us older folks. I'd have to say this is one of the better efforts ever by the Disney company.Broderick plays two roles, and is especially funny as the counterfeit Gadget with the fake teeth. The little girl in here is cute, too, and the talking car has some of the best lines of the film. At under 80 minutes, the film breezes by at good clip.

It captures some of the ethos of the 1980's, as well as the timeless pathos of the passage to adulthood. Matthew Broderick is superb in the title role, mixing the wise guy with the nice guy in the perfect proportions, so well that he may never truly escape from this role. The supporting cast is equally up to the task, with Alan Ruck, Jennifer Grey and Jeffrey Jones especially noteworthy. Charlie Sheen also makes the most of a small role late in the movie. There are an abundance of laughs from beginning to end, and like all of Hughes' films, it also has a heart, and a serious moment or two. This movie has been a part of my collection for many years, and will continue to provide enjoyment for as long as I am able to watch it.
