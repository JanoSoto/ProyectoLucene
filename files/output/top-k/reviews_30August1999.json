The film once again is futuristic, but not so much as that the audience has a hard time relating to the concepts.  Most of the movie takes place in an artificial world, but by the time you'll figure that out it will be two late.Even as the first scene took place, I knew that this would be a very hard film to follow. So I took out my trusty notepad determined that no plot points or important events would get by me. I was correct that the film was not an easy one to hold on two. But given the fact that we have already seen this idea in The Matrix earlier this year, I feel that I handled myself in an understandable manner. \tThe story begins about twenty years in the future, as an elderly man named Hannon Fuller is mysteriously  killed, stabbed to death by an unknown person. We later learn that Fuller was conducting a top secret research project that got a little out of control, and in result, he planned to shut it down for good. \tThe project is a mind machine that allows a person to lie down on it and transform their reality to a world as realistic as our own, in 1930's Las Angeles. The people there are just as real as you and me. They can think, react, and interpret information. However, this device is becoming a little too dangerous. Thus Fuller's attempt to destroy it was interrupted by his graphic death. \tWe then meet on of Fuller's partners named Douglas Hall, who is at first accused of the murder because he did not want the project to be shut down. The police question him, become suspicious, and ask him not to leave town for a few days. Doug then meets a woman who claims to be the daughter of Fuller, Jane, who makes a puzzling disappearance after showing up at his work site. He soon catches up with her, however, and states the fact that Mr. Fuller had no daughter. Things get very complicated from here.  Craig Bierko's performance is more than capable of getting an Oscar nomination. He is Douglas Hall, and plays out like a Dr. Jeckel and Mr. Hyde type character. Both his characters are more than clear and believable; this is one of the better performances I have seen this year. Gretchen Mol (Rounders, 1998) also does quite well in her role, although her character is a bit strained. Vincent D'Onofrio is almost up there with Bierko with a double role, but even he has trouble adapting to the change of environments and climaxes. Armin Mueller-Stahl's character, Fuller, was a pleasure to relate to and endure. I think The Thirteenth Floor, is what audiences were looking for in last years bomb Dark City. That film lacked a story. Not to mention it was all over the wall in action. The Thirteenth Floor, was a vary focused film The action was pinpointed to only what was necessary to though the plot, the story stays within the boundaries and is solid and thought provoking. The environment was very well developed. The only thing that this movie is missing is a firm grip on reality.

The movie has a few funny moments that would ruin a film noir but unfortunately too few of these funny moments to be a comedy.As for the movie being unrealistic, sick or lacking morals, well, of course it is but it is supposed to be a fiction... If regular people were doing so much cocaine and booze and chopping dead bodies into pieces like that, well, we would have a problem...Overall, an over-hyped movie.

Connery gives a superb performance - suave and smooth-talking with a clear edge of sadistic cruelty; a ruthless scientist, yet never simple in his motivations - less well told, the movie would be the old chestnut about the troubled girl who just needs a good screwing. The movie may be a little too long and flabby at places, but never loses its compact evocative power. When her blonde hair is shaken loose for the first time toward the end, it's as though her trauma has opened her to sexual availability (contrast with how buttoned up she is on her wedding night) in one of the film's many studies in codes of representation of womanhood - she shifts identity, evading the famous controlling glance of the male and yet utterly dependent on it (and on the flashback apparatus of cinema) for a frail return to real rather than imagined independence.

Scream was a brilliant parody of horror films while being scary in its own right and Dawson's Creek is a great television show.  But this film is just not that good.  It's not scary.  It's not well written or well thought out.  There really was no reason for guy from Rosanne to get killed.  He had nothing to do with it.  And it is the same thing in the sequel, most of the cast has nothing to do with it either.  I didn't find this flick scary in the least although the story at the beginning was interesting.  It is blessed with a cast of incredibly good looking people but that does not make it a good film to watch.  If you really enjoy seeing Love Hewitt running around with her breasts half exposed, Gellar looking particularly sexy, Phillipe trying to box, Prinze Jr. looking silly, stupid characters that do stupid things, unconvincing deaths, a trunk full of fish that conveniently disappears (smell and all) when it is required to, someone get a hair cut in their sleep without knowing it and a plethora of other really bad scenarios, then this is your movie.  However, if you want to see a good horror flick with teenagers getting killed, rent the early Fridays, the first Halloween, the first Nightmare, the first Texas, the first Evil Dead and even Scream.

The first time I watched it, I  missed some of the dialog (sometimes it seems that Irish-English and my Southern American English are two separate languages).  The second time I watched with the closed-caption on -- much better.  In light of the violence, filthy language, sex, and techno-supernatural of today's movies, this was a great old-fashion flick the family would enjoy.  There only one or two mild curse words and a distant shot of a couple of nude old men -- both items quite benign.  However, this is NOT American humor!  It's a study in how Europeans, especially  those from small towns in the British Isles see life. If you can follow that, you will thoroughly enjoy this delightful film.

If you can believe that such characters as Flat-Top and Mumbles exist, Gleanne Headley's character just happened to be named Tess Trueheart, and Madonna can act, than you can believe that Warren Beatty is young enough to play Dick Tracy.  That suspension of belief is necessary. It is true that Al Pacino steals the show as Big Boy even though he only did it as a favor.

Charlie Korsmo proves once again that he is one of our greatest child actors as the spunky Kid. The movie could hold your interest plot-wise as much as you care if Dick Tracy goes with Breathless or stays with Tess but comic book tradition already answers that question.  Instead, just sit back and enjoy the show. Also, I'm only 18 but I knew who Dick Tracy was before I saw the movie.  I remember the old cartoon being shown as well as the comic strip.

Then my eagerness lowered after I read some reviews (some were good, some were bad).  So my expectations were rattled.  I came out of the theater feeling pretty good.  At least I wasn't disappointed.  This wasn't another Godzilla.  But it wasn't Braveheart either.What I liked  Good action sequences.  It seems that lately action films go soft when blood is needed.  Now, I've never been a big fan of gore but when you're in the middle of a battle between Vikings and cannibalistic savages I think you can't go wrong with blood and realistic depiction of violence (the head-ripping shot was cool).  The sets and photography are really impressive, made the whole movie seem cold and frightening (well, maybe I felt cold because of the freezing air-conditioning; why do they turn it up so high?).What I disliked  I felt there could've been more.  There are many side stories that seem to want to develop but are nipped in the bud.  The first minute about why Ibn has to leave his country could've been stretched into at least 20 minutes.  This way, we could have learned more about the main character and his demons.  There could have been political intrigue, a forbidden love story, etc.  The Viking prince and Ibn's love interest seem to take us somewhere beyond the carnage and then they don't.  It's a shame.The verdict  As far as the action movie genre goes, The 13th Warrior was good enough to fit in the category with its head up high.  But with it's lack of psychological development and burgeoning side stories it doesn't go much further.  This film could have definitely reached epic proportions (like Lawrence of Arabia and Braveheart) but for reasons previously mentioned it remains simply an action movie.

At one point Snipes just comes out and asks (more like screams) what do you want from me?!  To which DeNiro replies...nothing! He doesnt say a word.  Thats when you know the film is a total waste as he doesnt even have a reason for his behavior.  Another annoying aspect is how Tony Scott shoots EVERY scene in close-up it seems like.  Every characrter is right up in our face in virtually every shot and it makes the screen so claustrophobic like youve been crowded into a room with bodies shoved up against you.  And now for the baseball scenes, so unproffesionally put together.  I mean a player wearing a visiting uniform hits a ball to the outfield...in his home stadium!  Now all of a sudden hes wearing a home white uniform as he runs the bases.  Or a ball is pitched in Candlestick Park and after its hit the outfield becomes that of Coors Field. Or fans doing the wave in every shot, or the final game played in nearly hurricane like conditions.  Oh, what a mess.  What can you expect of a British born director?
