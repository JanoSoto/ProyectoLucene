I actually wasn't sure the first time when i saw this in or about 2001 but the it pulled me back in...watching it again made me love it more. I know its a bit far fetched and the stereo types are a bit much but its all worth it in the end. Paul Rudd gives one of his best performances. Its a feel good 1980's movie and the soundtrack is FANTASTIC!! The music, the people and the ideas of the 80's. Sooo care free and just fun\/misguided. Its a bit here and there but in the end its all GREAT and I would recommend it to all! The cast is a fantastic mix of all types and it just adds to the pull of this Hurricane of a comedy. I feel its just a great mix of a ton of actors. Hope you enjoy! ","genre":null},{"date":"19 August 2008","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Loved this movie.

Although being released in 1991, almost anybody watching Drop Dead Fred for the first time will love it despite it's maturing age. Rik Mayall is without a doubt the star of this film playing Drop Dead Fred, Elizabeth's imaginary friend who turns up when she needs him most - aka when her life is in turmoil and she needs to find fun and happiness again to have the strength to carry on through. Mischievous and rude Fred is absolutely hilarious, coming up with childish yet spiked pranks, sayings and nicknames which mortify Elizabeth despite her having loved him to pieces when she was a young child faced with her formidable mother.Although it is rated in the UK as a 15 certificate I personally think that a 12 certificate would have been more suitable for this film as it DOES appeal from the young to the old, and only contains a few choice swear words which are fairly mild.Highly recommended that you should watch, or even better buy - its extremely cheap because of its release date and your couple of quid spent will definitely not be a couple of quid wasted!
