But my esteem for the movie has grown over the years. I still find something new to enjoy in it each time I watch it. I mainly like the movie not only because I remember all the background music by heart, but also the movie is exceptional and memorable because it has good dialogue with many humorous one-liners. The malapropism by Joe, the leader of the Pharaoh's, Rome wasn't burned in a night! is a classic; the deadpan face line by Curt to Steve at 300 AM when Steve inquires to where he is going, `I have,. a dental appointment.; Curt to Steve and Laurie while in her car after he sees the blonde in the T-Bird who has just whispered to him through the closed window, `You two have no romance, no soul! Someone out there roaming the streets wants me, Steven hang a right!' Terry the Tiger's pickup line to Debbie, Hey did anybody ever tell you, you look a lot like Connie Stevens; Falfa's gum-chewing girl to Milner after Falfa guns his '55 Chevy and it roars,Ain't he neat!; Debbie's longing car comment to Terry, ...I just love tuck and roll upholstery.; Carlos of the Pharaohs protesting to Ants the Pharaoh as they struggle to get in the '51 Mercury, Hey man you can't call shotgun all night! or the howl of the jesting DJ on the car radio, `Hang on, we're gonna rock and roll ourselves to death!. The list goes on. The dialogue keeps you interested within each scene while the major theme of the four teenagers occurring in a non-linear fashion forces you to question the nights ending while at the same time not wanting the picture to end. And to all this add the glue of the music on everybody's car radio and the ever present DJ voice and the result is not only a potent nostalgic and semi-historical film, but a fabulous tapestry of music, acting, dialogue, cars and directing from the genius of George Lucas. I realized after doing a little sleuthing that there is an interesting time-age characteristic in the 10-year window that exists between the time settings of the movie, 1962, and the time that the movie was shot, 1972. Two of the major characters and a few of the minor characters were actually teenagers themselves during the late '50s and early '60s and grew up with the music and the times just as George Lucas did. At the instance of the film in 1972 Cindy Williams and Richard Dreyfuss were both 26 years old each playing a character 8 years their junior. Candy Clark, who plays Debbie, was also 16 in 1962. Harrison Ford and Bo Hopkins were both 30 at the time of filming, placing them at 20 years old in 1962. An odd time-age inversion is that in the movie John Milner, played by Paul LeMat, is 20,the aging teenager and therefore the oldest of the major teenage characters. But in 1962 he was only 10 years old and 20 in 1972, one of the younger members of the Graffiti cast. And of course the grand old master George Lucas was a mere 28 at the time of filming placing him younger or as old as many of the people he was directing.
