But, structurally, the movie has many problems.  The character focus shifts rather arbitrarily, the large flashback seriously damages the flow of the story, and the plot is weighed down with elements that are not at all supported (why is the sword so special, for example).

Every fight seen was filmed with actors hanging on wires.  There's not explaination as to how they can do this, you just have to take it for granted and it looks so incredibly fake all of the time.

None of them compare to this. The realism of the setting, the customs, the sets just give you the feeling that this is the way it was back then. This is a movie that needs no computer generated effects to use as a crutch. The battle scenes are phenominal. The acting is great. You never once in the movie question any of the characters. The direction is nearly flawless. The story is everything you want in an action-adventure. The character of Conan is a very emotional one, from the sorrow of losing his family and his people to the joy of meeting new friends and new hope to the sorrow and sadness of losing his girlfriend. The development of Conan's character is wonderful, you get to see exactly where he's been and what make him tick. Conan is a true hero. The violence and realism of this movie with nothing held back is what I expect from action movies. Especially since this movie was made in 1982. Nothing else comes close to this day. Will there ever be a movie like this again? No. I have seen this movie more times then I can count and every time I find it as entertaining as ever. The score for this movie is one of the best I have ever heard. The music gets you pumped up and perfectly fits every scene. The swordsmanship of Arnold is phenominal. I love sword fighting movies. No fencing here, its raw swordsmenship skill. The weapons look genuine and they look awesome.Words cannot fully describe the greatness of this movie and the fact that its only got a 6.? rating from the voters totally does it unjustice. I would without a doubt give this a 10. This is a full movie with everything in it. Its got a great ending and leaves us wanting more and more.

As it turns out, gay people, like non-gay people, can be all those things (and aren't we all tired of it) and so much more. In fact, the most distinguishing characteristic of gay people is that, for the most part, they are virtually indistinguishable from non-gay people. Isn't it about time a movie just allowed its central gay characters to be a couple of cute young guys whose casual meeting teeters over the course of a hilariously frustrating evening on the verge of becoming more than a one night stand?Gabriel, played by Christian Campbell, Neve Campbell's older brother, is a shy, aspiring composer with dimples to die for. Mark, J. P. Pitoc, is an outgoing journalism student who earns money as a go-go boy and has the body to prove it. Pitoc and Campbell, who appear together again in the Thank You, Good Night, gel beautifully as the put-upon would-be lovers. In a world where meeting and having sex can be a rather common and often all too impersonal event, they meet, and like most people their age, they want to have sex. But the story that gently unfolds is not at all common. It's tender, funny, and much more romantic than it sounds.Tori Spelling, it hurts me to even write this, is terrific as Gabriel's oh-so theatrical friend. She maintains a drama in her life that can be endearing, but is often times more annoying, the latter which Ms. Spelling portrays with great comic success. The rest of the cast is fairly unremarkable, with two notable exceptions. Steve Hayes is brilliant as a friend from Gabriel's theatre class whose hilarious Como te gusta mi pinga is the funniest cabaret number since Priscilla. Clinton Leupp as drag queen Coco Peru, delivers a delightful bathroom soliloquy that will have you in stitches. Even more amusing is the fact that Miss Coco looks distractingly like Ms. Spelling's character, right down to the overabundance of drama.Trick is an uplifting and life-affirming look at being young and gay and almost in love. Surely you were at least one of these things once.
