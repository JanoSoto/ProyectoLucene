It's a war movie that also tries to display the thoughts of its characters, and it visually showed me the war in the Pacific in a way I hadn't seen before -- for instance, by showing us not just soldiers but at least some of the native inhabitants of the islands (although basically as mute savages).I didn't really enjoy the long poetic stretches though, at least not on DVD. I thought they were too elaborate, too well formulated to be realistic, and too ditzy. It's something that came across better when I saw this movie for the first time in a proper cinema.The narration has its flaws, too. It was only after I read the synopsis on Wikipedia that I learned that Pt Witt had gone AWOL with the natives prior to the main events of the film; before, I always wondered how he got to hang out with them. Apparently the movie was heavily rearranged during editing and many scenes ended up on the cutting room floor (I would have loved to have seen Mickey Rourke in this!), so that may account for the choppy narration. It's also difficult to follow the individual story threads as the film switches around quite a bit, and those actors all look pretty much alike (all Latin lover types except Nick Nolte).Oh, and I thought that the shell-shocked soldier ranting on about Leaves! In the wind! That's what we are! was too histrionic.So, this movie may not live up to all its aspirations, but it's still absolutely watchable.

I'm warning you. This movie is absolute GARBAGE and SERIOUSLY a waste of time! I wouldn't even call it a movie. I had to watch this for a class so I didn't really have a choice. I wanted to turn it off so badly. I want my 97 minutes of life back! At least I didn't have to pay a dime for this mess. But then again, time is money... I should be reimbursed $100 for seeing this movie. The gimmick movie never gets any better. Trust me.Sure, the idea sounds interesting (take four cameras and shoot simultaneously without cuts), and it was an ambitious attempt, I'll give that, but honestly, the end result is sooooooooooooooooo HORRIBLE. It's like a really bad student film.This experiment just shows why movies need cuts, directing actors (even the big stars were horrible in most of the scenes), a real script with a real story, and most importantly, using a freaking boom mic (obviously they didn't use one because it would get in the shots). It is extremely boring and horribly shot.You can tell which scene the director wants you to focus on by the audio level; the audio gain becomes louder for the one that should be focused on by the audience and the rest become less. The director cheats because while one scene that is being focused, the rest is just obviously dragging time doing absolutely nothing. For example, Jeanne Tripplehorn (Water World, Sliding Doors), I think she was supposed to be Hayak's lesbian agent or something... all she basically does is sit in her Limo 95% of the film(sometimes she gets out of it) wearing headphones to spy on Hayak. Wow. What a great part for her! I guess she accepted the role so she could make out with Salma Hayek.That reminds me... what is up with the random lesbian scenes? Everyone seems to be lesbians and making out constantly like a porno flick. It's a pathetic device to keep the simple minded audience to keep watching. That's probably the only reason some people voted high. And of course they just have to have drugs in a movie... LAME.And they also randomly throw in THREE pointless huge earthquakes within a few minutes from each other in this movie, just because they want to show off that the scenes are all connected (we'd probably forget they're all supposed to be connected if it wasn't for that gimmick effect). But so what? Obviously someone in the crew is just queuing all the cameraman with a countdown (probably with an earpiece) and then they all just shake the camera.This movie literally is like a cheap student film. I'm not kidding.Blair Witch Project cost less to make and was also experimental, but it actually was well-made and intriguing (they even had better acting!) and that's why it succeeded, even to the mass market, as well as the style repeated years later like Cloverfield.The climax for the Blair Witch was worth it and was actually the best part of movie. For this movie, the ending is just as bad as the entire movie, especially the acting. It really falls apart. It actually turned into more of a comedy; the security guard doesn't do anything, and neither does the front desk lady or whoever it was, saying You can't go in there but they don't do a damn thing! Worst security ever. I mean, come on. There was absolutely nothing close to being real about this movie. People are so oblivious and obviously only acting on 'que' than anything close to being natural. Oh, and did I mention it turns into a porno flick every so often.The gunshot just sounds horribly cheap. Hayak's reaction and everyone else to the gunshot is laughable. And out of nowhere, what is up with the girl, who was giving the pitch, all of a sudden just filming the dead body? -- And the lady in complete white, that was sitting outside with the security guard (why was he just chilling outside?!), seems like she was some sick person from an institute, just joins the scene as if she's some medical assistant but does absolutely nothing to help the guy. This movie was just so annoying, laughable and a complete mess.I'd bet the cast weren't that impressed with the final result than they first heard about the idea and getting on-board.

Granted, it is not done in Altman's usual style, and may seem vague or shallow to some, but I believe that this is a misconception. The characters... some are rather undeveloped, but I have a hunch that this is on purpose. 2 hours is not enough to form a picture of a person, and so I think Altman made them so undeveloped because these are, when all is said and done, regular people. A large amount of correspondents, a few model designers, a bit of these, a few of those... the only character which seemed foolishly vague in my opinion was the Communist Italian. Apart from that, I only saw people that I would see on the street, or on some show, or some that I wouldn't see at all, that merely write stories which others publish and get credited for.The theme of fashion design seems to be quite irrelevant here, or rather, it serves as the backdrop for an array of the aforementioned characters. Who cares about a fashion show when such drama is going on? Who cares who designed what dress when a mischievous Irishman is so irreverently teasing famous personages in such a hilarious manner? Who cares what outfit was voted best when two complete strangers are trying to sort out the mess their arrival was? All in all, I believe that this movie fits comfortably among Altman's successes. The story is gripping, logical, and possesses a vivid array of characters reminiscent of Guy Ritchie's films (yes, not exactly chronically correct Guy Ritchie came later, but I just wanted to make the image.), and funny.

Adapted from Truman Capote's controversial novel of the same name, it tells the story of Holly Golightly, a free-wheeling call girl (in the novel, at least) who attempts to dissolve herself into upper-class society by attending lavish parties and courting wealthy men whom she denies her honest affection. There's plenty to like about the film, and it's certainly the most polished and elegant effort I've seen so far from director Blake Edwards 'The Pink Panther (1964)' and 'The Party (1968)' seem somehow irretrievably trapped in the 1960s. However, in what is probably a simple case of personal preference, it never quite clicked, at least not in the same way as 'Casablanca (1942)' or 'An Affair to Remember (1957).' I did, in any case, understand to some degree why many viewers, particularly women, could connect with the main protagonist on a more intimate level. Maybe they can see a little of themselves in Holly Golightly.Of course, any mention of 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' immediately calls to mind the image of Audrey Hepburn, and it's certainly among her most iconic performances, which is interesting given how it strayed somewhat from her typical screen persona. Unlike the shy and girlish Cinderella of 'Roman Holiday (1953)' or 'Sabrina (1954),' Holly Golightly is slightly arrogant, intrusive and fiercely extroverted. So determined is she to remain a free-spirited personality that she has barred herself from any meaningful human relationships, despite having accumulated a social circle that extends into the hundreds. Truman Capote had originally envisioned Marilyn Monroe in the main role, but Hepburn brings to Holly a certain delicacy and keen-eyed intelligence that is unique to her. Behind the character's breezy and outgoing personality is a sense of vulnerability and loneliness, of a drifting soul who idly attaches to thirty lovers a month without making any sort of emotional connection. Blake Edwards poignantly ties up the climax with an embrace in the rain, demonstrating a tenderness and sophistication that I hadn't expected of him.Among the supporting performers, Martin Balsam is most certainly worth a mention, playing Holly's womanising, to-the-point agent, who publicly holds the opinion that his client is a real phony &#150; that is, she herself genuinely believes in her own spurious lifestyle. Finally, I like Mickey Rooney as much as the next man, but what's going on here? When Richard Barthelmess donned ridiculous Oriental make-up in Griffith's 'Broken Blossoms (1919),' at least the portrayal was respectful and sympathetic. Racial stereotypes can work adequately enough in comedies (see Peter Sellers in 'The Party (1968)' or 'Murder by Death (1976)'), and 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' certainly has comedic elements, but the rest of the film also has an impeccable elegance that clashes horribly with the dim-witted slapstick of Mr. Yunioshi. If, indeed, the character had to exist, it would have been far less distracting had an Asian actor been cast in the role; some would certainly have existed in Hollywood at the time.

I didn't see either of those two famous films from start to finish until years after their release. I saw all of Billy Madison for the first time in 2003, and don't recall being too pleased. I finally watched Happy Gilmore in 2006, and definitely thought it was better than its predecessor. Watching Billy Madison again this year, I was more impressed than I was before, but still found some of it a tad embarrassing. Overall, it was a mixed blessing for me that time. After my second viewing of that film, I watched Happy Gilmore again, and I definitely still prefer it. In fact, it may have been just a bit better to me than it was the first time.Happy Gilmore is a wannabe hockey player who was raised by his grandmother. He has failed in his attempts to make the professional league due to his lack of skating skills and trouble controlling his temper. His grandmother hasn't paid her taxes in years, and owes a total of $270,000 to the IRS. Because of this, she is evicted from her house (a house which Happy claims his grandfather built with his bare hands), and is forced to live in a retirement home, which is secretly run as a sweatshop! Happy must find a way to make $270,000 in time, before the house is sold, and discovers how far he can hit golf balls. Soon after ex-golf pro Chubbs Peterson sees his skill, and leads him into professional golf, only because Happy knows this is a chance to make money and save his grandmother's house. He turns out to be a huge hit on the pro golf tour, but his aggressive tendencies may be a problem here as well, and golfing champion Shooter McGavin is determined to bring him down! Sandler played the same kind of character in this film as he did in Billy Madison, a goofy, immature maniac. Both films are pretty silly, but this one doesn't get QUITE as puerile as its predecessor (for example, no pants wetting gags here), and while not every single gag in this film made me laugh, none of them actually embarrassed me, which some of the gags in Sandler's 1995 film seemed to do. In Happy Gilmore, the comedian made me laugh quite a few times, sometimes hard, with his antics in the lead role, involving slapstick and insanity. Highlights for me included his tirade on the golf course and some fights he gets into, including one with game show host Bob Barker. While Sandler provides most of the humour, some of the other cast members can also be funny, such as Joe Flaherty in his bit part as the Jeering Fan, there to make Happy Gilmore's game more difficult.During Adam Sandler's film career, he has had some big hits as well as flops. It seems this one turned out to be one of his successful films, which I would say it deserved to be, unlike, let's say, the 2002 feature-length cartoon, Eight Crazy Nights, which deservingly tanked. As usual with films starring the former Saturday Night Live comedian, this one is crude and rather juvenile, though certainly not as juvenile as some of his other films. I guess that's one of the things I like about it. Unlike some of Sandler's comedies, including Billy Madison, and even more so the rather disgusting Eight Crazy Nights, this one doesn't tend to overdo the puerile humour.

I vaguely remember seeing some of his films as a kid but obviously i was to young to appreciate the pure genius of the man. Although in my opinion One upon a time in the West is not his best movie , it still provides all the hallmarks that make Leone on of the most admired directors of all time.To get his hands on prime railroad land in Sweetwater, crippled railroad baron Morton hires killers, led by blue-eyed sadist Frank , who wipe out property owner Brett McBain and his family. McBain's newly arrived bride, Jill , however, inherits it instead. Both outlaw Cheyenne and lethally mysterious Harmonica take it upon themselves to look after Jill and thwart Frank's plans to seize her land. As alliances and betrayals mutate, it soon becomes clear that Harmonica wants to get Frank for another reason -- it has something to do with death.As i have said there certain things that make Sergio Leone movies extremely distinctive and in this movie they are no different. The cinematography is sharp and crisp and it puts most modern films to shame. How he gets such detail in the profile shots of his actors is amazing and is strangely hypnotic. He also manages to get his actors to perform at the top of their game even though a lot of the time they are doing very little other than looking into the camera.Henry Fonda's portrayal of Frank is probably the best i have ever seen from him and is maybe the best performance by an actor in a Leone film that i have seen so far. His piercing blue eyes stare down the camera lens with a haunting glare and it is hard not to feel sucked in. One scene that particularly sticks in my mind is when he is on the bed with Jill.

You know what they are. No matter what organization or website lists them, the list is almost always the same. And the one thing that the supposed elite movies of all time share in common As far as story, they're all average. Not a single one of them has even a single scene of outstanding originality, or even flirts with it, for that matter. They're all generic paint-by-the-number dramas filled with pretty moving pictures and filled with people who can pretend to be someone else fairly well. But as far as story goes, these movies are all empty. There are a few exceptions&#x97;Star Wars, Pulp Fiction, a couple others&#x97;but that is a standard rule. The obsession with unoriginality that the pretentious men and women who chose what films are the best has always bothered me. And what better illustrates this than The Godfather? It is nothing but a generic crime drama, yet it's considered one of the greatest movies of all time? Something just seems wrong with that. Something seems wrong with the idea that the men who truly stand up and make original cinema get pushed to hell by critics, while a generic crime movie sits on the throne of God.Perhaps the perfect-scored reviews of The Godfather are right. On a technical level, on a storytelling level, on an acting level, The Godfather is perfection. The directing and production value so far surpasses everything from the early 70s, it's almost unbelievable. The storytelling is done flawlessly. I cannot think of a single 70s film where every single kill has so much value and weight. The acting is the stuff of legends. I will give The Godfather all of this credit, because it earns it. But . . .But none of that dismisses the fact that it is still simply a generic crime drama. No matter how well-done this story is told, it's a story that you've heard long before it was released. Unlike the modern gangster cinema, such as Ichi the Killer or Reservoir Dogs, The Godfather offers nothing new, even for its time. I understand that those examples I just listed are both meant to be taken as over-the-top and unrealistic, but my point still stands. People have created far more original and entertaining crime dramas than The Godfather. There is one subplot that I give this film some creative credit for&#x97;the horse&#x97;but beside that, this is just copy\/paste plotting. If they had used the creativity of this scene more often throughout the movie, this truly would deserve the over-hyped credit it gets. Just because something is realistic does not mean it has to be unoriginal. Personally, I am Italian, and I have heard hundreds of real-life mob stories from my cousins, and they're all infinitely more interesting\/creative than anything this film even touched. There is no excuse for The Godfather being as dry as it is.Some will argue that The Godfather is meant to be a drama about family life, not a thriller about crime. If that is true, and it may hold some truth, then The Godfather excels. Somewhat. As far as realistic emotion of family life, it's pretty solid and mildly cliché-defying. But it's nothing you haven't seen before, and seen with more compelling presentation.The other major flaw that is inevitable to ignore is the pure boredom that sets in every thirty minutes. I've read reviews stating that this modern generation simply can't relate to gangster films, thus it's boring. I've read reviews stating that the plot is generic, thus it's boring. Etc., etc., etc. All these may be valid reasons, but I think the point is this The Godfather IS boring. It's filled with pointless conversation scenes that add nothing to the overall film or the generic plot or the drama, so what's the point of even including them? Pretentious-minded reviewers say that the viewer needs to be patient . . . Patient for what? Unlike Ridley Scott's Alien, there is rarely any payoff after the endless buildup in The Godfather. There is no entertainment value. While I'm completely fine with a film lacking entertainment value in order to show honest desperation or to intentionally offend, The Godfather does neither. All the reviews stating that this is a violent movie can be ignored. There is far more graphic violence in PG- and PG-13-rated movies of the past two years than this.With all the valid flaws I just listed, anyone calling this movie absolutely flawless is in denial. Or just has extremely low standards. While The Godfather is compelling and has masterful plotting and directing, it is simply just another face in the unoriginal crowd when you look at the big picture.Perhaps it was very influential in cinema&#x97;why should that effect how you personally view the film? Just because pretentious film buffs claim it's flawless, can you really not think of a single film that you enjoyed more? CLASSIC is just a word slapped onto films that critics are brainwashed into appreciating. It has no bearing on the true artistic or emotional value. It really shouldn't even have any bearing on public opinion, but it does. Imagine with me a world where The Godfather had been critically hated. Do you really think it would still receive the high public ratings that it has now? I highly doubt it. No one makes up their own mind anymore; anyone who does is considered a mindless shock jock, no matter how valid their reasoning is. While the best reasoning I have read for why The Godfather&#x97;other than the generic good plot, good acting, etc.&#x97;is considered so great is, BECAUSE IT IS. SHUT UP.

The film still features Waters' style, but the bad taste is massively toned down and the whole feel of the movie could be described as 'John Waters Lite'. The film is set in 1962 Baltimore and music is the major focus of the film. Waters obviously realised that the style of it would be the major attraction; and as such has taken time to lay it on as thick as possible, and this blends well with the music and storyline. The plot focuses on a corny music show enjoyed by the teens in Baltimore. 'Pleasantly plump' Tracy Turnblad is one of the many obsessed by this show and sets out to get a role as one of the dancers. She achieves her goal and soon becomes a local hero, but she loses some friends when she decides to use her success in order to speak out for what she believes in - namely social integration.While John Waters' style is one of the best things about the movie, in another way it's one of the worst. In his earlier films, the content is generally distracting enough for the audience not to really notice the rather boring directorial style; but this film doesn't have that, and while the style is a big enough distraction at first; it soon becomes clear that the plot is rather lacking and the film becomes dull before we even reach the halfway point. Hairspray stars Ricki Lake in the lead role, and she does a rather good job with it. The role doesn't require any great acting talents, but she is at least bright and breezy for the duration. The rest of the cast is filled out nicely by an eclectic list of names, which includes Debbie Harry, Divine, Pia Zadora and even the director himself in an amusing role as a psychologist. The message regarding segregation may well be a good one; but really it's not all that interesting and isn't put forward particularly well, and that's where the film falls down.

Many years later to 1981 to be precise, a lovely rich woman Liza (Catriona MacColl) invests in the hotel despite warnings from a blind girl named Emily whom she doesn't believe in her stories of the hotel being haunted. When bizarre accidents occur and weird things start happening, the hotel is haunted by evil spirits and the gates of hell is opened.Co-starring David Warbeck, this is Lucio Fulci's masterpiece of the macabre all the way. Influenced by the works of H.P. Lovecraft, this Italian supernatural horror thriller has became one of the best cult horror movies ever and still holds up.

I, Claudius it ain't. The cast consists of Malcolm McDowell as Caligula, Peter O'Toole as Tiberius, John Gielgud as Nerva, Helen Mirren as Caesonia and the flopping, furry bits and pieces of a lot of naked Italian extras. It is stunning and amusing to see the likes of Gielgud and Mirren recite their lines with serious intent and then watch a quick cut-away to hardcore fellatio at a Bob Guccione version of an orgy. It has to be said The orgies are the most boring part of this movie. Guccione cuts in hardcore sex with all the timing of a metronome. Extras do so much genital fingering I'm surprised they didn't come down with carpel tunnel syndrome. Peter O'Toole, as a seriously degenerate Tiberius, has been known to give ripe and awful performances in his career. Here, he outdoes himself. It's not that the man is shameless, it's that he appears embarrassingly to be trying to give a performance. Malcolm McDowell is the only one who seems to be amused at the awful role he agreed to play for what, I hope, was a lot of money. McDowell is a fascinating, sly, humorous and serious actor. Even when he's humping around enjoying both the bride and the groom at a wedding party, or doing a lascivious dance to please Peter O'Toole, or ordering his legions to attack the papyrus, or playing the sneering host at a long, long orgy (with all those close-up cut-aways), I still like him. He carries what acting weight there is in this tank of rancid Penthouse rejects. Guccione, the editor and publisher of Penthouse who produced Caligula (and directed the hardcore parts), seems to have no more an erotic imagination here than he had in his magazine. The movie is so humorless, so hypocritical and so cheesy it not only will put you off Caligula, it probably will put you off genitals.

Lasting only ninety-six minutes but feeling much longer, Bad Lieutenant sucks you in to what you believe at first to be the tale of a crooked cop before the realisation slowly dawns upon the viewer that this is going to be much more unpleasant than any gritty 'corrupt police officer' film that you'll have seen before. Bad Lieutenant is the systematic and compulsive destruction of the nameless protagonist in a film which can have you feeling as emetic as Harvey Keitel's character does on screen.Any viewer who watches this film under the delusion that Keitel's character is anywhere near comparable to his Mr White in Reservoir Dogs will find themselves in for the shock of their lives. In what is undoubtedly his most sublime on screen acting performance Keitel conveys believability by endowing his character with a harsh sense of reality leaving the cinematographic term gritty to be definitively redefined. The Lieutenant played is not merely a corrupt cop but a man who has no control over reality, a man who is an addict on all levels as he corrodes his body with the ridiculous amount of drugs consumed throughout, and burns a hole in his wallet as he gambles uncontrollably. He is a man losing his mind minute by minute, who finds himself digging a deeper and deeper pit for what is seemingly an inevitable grave.While being probably one of the most upsettingly disturbing stories in cinematic history, the one key criticism from most is the perceived wafer-thin plot that accompanies the grandeur of Keitel. In what is ostensibly a side story, but dove tails nicely into the Lieutenants tale, a nun is raped by two individuals that she herself teaches and looks after at the Catholic church and school she is apart of. Frankie Thorn as the nun, is the antithesis to Keitel's lieutenant. She commands the screen with a contemplative sense of redemption, a woman that has so little, who is then abused ruthlessly, and yet is still willing to forgive those that committed the horrors against her. As Keitel investigates, interspersed heavily with gambling, drug taking and the occasional abuse of his police powers, the link between our two key characters is slowly revealed, as Keitel is shown watching his daughter receive her first Holy Communion at the Catholic church he attends, all the while orchestrating another bet with his bookie beside him. The interesting juxtaposition is subtle while sledgehammer blatant. Keitel wears a cross around his neck and for him is the cross he bears, the shadowing hanging over him, throughout the film. It is a reminder of a previous life, and also a reminder of what he could, and can be. The further into the mire he sinks, the more he references his religious beliefs and uses them to try and convince others, while mainly himself, of his righteous creed, all the while the recovering nun draws upon her belief as a means of strength, rationale and justification.Bad Lieutenant is not your usual good cop gone wrong tale, and I would heavily warn those that are expecting shoot outs at dawn to stay well clear. Bad Lieutenant is a tale of realisation and redemption but primarily of the abuse and corruption of the human body and spirit. Keitel's character comes across as someone that tried to do the right thing yet finds himself spiraling downward while one of the more interesting points is the sense of restraint he gives his character, that for all his drug taking and gambling addiction, that he despises himself for it, that he wishes he weren't doing it, and more importantly that he has no fun doing it, but that it has just come habit. Bad Lieutenant is a hard hitting film which will uppercut those not ready for it into a depressive coma, because to be frank, Bad doesn't begin to cover how far removed from Bad the Lieutenant is.

I do have to agree that it is a serious comic book movie, very faithful to the original comic books.I also consider this movie to be the first official Batman movie because it was not only the first released by Warner Bros., but the first based off the source material (although there was a Batman movie back in 1966, that was actually based off the TV series of the 1960s.)It's also a little bit of a shame Tim Burton is now doing a take on my favourite children's book Alice in Wonderland, because Disney will be releasing it and I like their 1951 animated cartoon version, although the movie did screw up the book.I thought some of the action scenes were great, like Batman getting chased by the Joker's goons and Batman fighting against the Joker. For any fan of Batman, this is an essential movie to watch. As a fan myself, I rate it 10 out of 10.
