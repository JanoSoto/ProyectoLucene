DeGaulle was a military man who stepped up to the plate when his country's fortunes were at their darkest. A whole lot of other more important army figures could have done what he did, but no one stepped to the plate like that courageous if sometimes exasperating junior brigadier general.Another guy who stepped to the plate for France was not a military man, in fact it was the army he took on. The Life of Emile Zola is the story about that man, brought beautifully to life by Paul Muni who was a modern writer who first fought to write life as he saw it and not through some romantic gauze as was popular in the first half of the 19th century. His writings led to a lot of social reform in France.Yet half the film is dedicated to Zola's last struggle, taking up the cause of wrongly convicted Captain Alfred Dreyfus. Joseph Schildkraut won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar of 1937 who when treason was discovered was singled out because he was a Jew as the fall guy.Although Hollywood tends to over-dramatize in many cases this is one where they are telling the absolute truth. I find it hard to fathom myself that even after proof was brought to the French Army's attention that another was in fact the guilty party, they persisted in promoting the fiction about Dreyfus's guilt. Anti-Semitism certainly ran deep in many quarters of French society, the military being only one of them. Keeping faith with prejudice was more important than getting at the truth and getting justice for a wrongly accused man.Muni's address to the court during the libel suit trial the army brought against him is classic. Though many feel his style of acting is outmoded, I for one miss that. I can't think of a player today who could move the audience as Muni did in that address. He was nominated for Best Actor, but he had won that award the previous year for The Story of Louis Pasteur and in 1937 was beaten by Spencer Tracy for Captains Courageous.However The Life of Emile Zola won for Best Picture of 1937 and also won for Best adapted Screenplay. I can't think of better praise to give the film than to say that if Emile Zola could have been interviewed he'd have given the film an enthusiastic rave.France like a lot of countries has had people come to their leadership in an hour of need. In the 15th century it was a peasant girl whom we know as Joan of Arc. During the occupation by the Nazis, France's honor was preserved by Charles DeGaulle.

Like Martin Scorsese's movies usually it is also over-hyped, or at least that's what I think. Don't get me wrong, I liked the movie, but the rating of 8.5 at IMDb is probably a bit too much, it is not that great. The movie tells a story about Travis Bickle, a Vietnam veteran who works as a taxi driver at nights. He is constantly disturbed by the life around him and that gets him mentally unstable. He thinks the streets of New York City are full of trash and by that he is referring to people, and all the injustice and corruption the world around him has. Bickle doesn't have any real friends and he starts to question his own existence, he is lonely and a complete outsider to everyone, failing to make any emotional contact with anyone. The film follows Travis's story's progress from attempts to desperation and it deals with mental issues along with the search of love and happiness.The best thing this movie has to offer is Robert De Niro, who does an amazing role performance in the role of Travis Bickle. The character itself is very well written as well, so De Niro only had to translate the character on to the screen and he managed that pretty flawlessly. The whole progress of the character is just brilliantly acted out, all the facial expressions and the whole body language changes along the progress in a fantastic way and De Niro makes one of the best role performances he has done this far. It was also pretty interesting to see De Niro in such a young age, as he was magnificent back then as well, even he actually was 33 years old when the movie was made. The story focuses completely on Travis and there aren't much scenes where he wouldn't be, although there are supporting actors\/actresses along the way. The one in the most supporting role is Jodie Foster, who in the age of 14 plays a child prostitute. I was very surprised how good actress she was even back then, in the age of 14! She is so real and performs the role of Iris superbly, I just can't believe she was only 14. Two small parts are played by the legends Peter Boyle (god bless the man) and Harvey Keitel, Boyle in the role Wizard, another taxi driver in New York City who gives advice to Travis and Keitel in the role of Sport, a pimp in New York City who for example sells Iris for money and who Travis just can't stand.Directed by Martin Scorsese, the movie is definitely recognizable as his, as it certainly has that Scorsese touch in it, though I think it is darker than Martin's movies usually. Scorsese always seems to describe violence in a very violent way and he doesn't hide the truth, though sometimes a fictional truth, behind the true violence and other disturbing images. This movie is all in all very disturbing and like Scorsese's movies usually it's also pretty heavy, so the weak minded viewers won't be enjoying it and watching it all the way through. The heaviness is also caused by that slight dullness the movie starts to have after the first hour and it seems like stretched, you keep on watching these irrelevant scenes which don't even matter so much in the end and the movie sadly loses its flow. It does get better towards the end, but there's just this one part of the movie where it seems to stumble a little bit. Maybe I'm being too harsh, so don't slay me because of that, but after all that is just my opinion. The screenplay is pretty much only the building of the main character, the movie is after all a story about Travis Bickle and no-one else. Despite the fact of the screenplay being almost nothing else than the story about the character it still manages to have surprisingly much depth in the plot, which is a very nice thing, as it also drops the heaviness level a little bit.Taxi Driver offers you a disturbing, yet psychologically clever experience, not forgetting the intelligence it has inside it. Robert De Niro is undeniably the best thing the movie has to offer, so I'm recommending the movie for everyone who is seeking a movie with an astonishing role performance. Like mentioned before this movie isn't for the weak minded, but if you still want to see it then it's your decision and you have been warned. Taxi Driver is partly all in all interesting, above decent without a doubt and it could be described as an artistic rather than an ordinary movie. So for those who are in search of a light and an easy movie for the Friday evening to watch with a girlfriend, then this isn't for you. It requires concentration and nerves, thinking and collecting pieces of the puzzle afterwards. It's not a phenomenal one, but it's definitely a good one. If all this still doesn't satisfy you, then for god sakes please watch it just because of the experience of seeing the hilarious long dark curly hair Harvey Keitel has in it. Marvellous.

Sadly, for me, this was not the case. It was a decent movie, of course; but, in the end, it had a few major flaws.First and foremost is a flaw that many may see as a great asset (thus pointing out the obviously subjective nature of movie watching) its length. Now, I have nothing against long movies, but this one just seemed to drag on and on and on. I've seen many people who made this complaint get called people with low attention spans and low intelligence; this is complete idiocy. The movie had, for all its apparent greatness, many superfluous scenes (the parts of the movie that took place in Sicily seemed particularly long and drawn out). It truly did not know when to end, and thus did not keep my interest.Another flaw was the the pompousness of the film. It truly seemed to me that every person involved was completely full of themselves and the movie they were making. It just bugged the crud out of me.Another flaw was the underdevelopment of many of the other crime bosses in the film, all of which are of course killed by Michael's men. I didn't even know any of their names, and this alone should show you how little I could care about them. A great movie makes you care about even the villains, so that their deaths are affecting.There's more I could say, but I have limited space here, so I'll just sum it up by saying that it was decent, but far from the greatest movie ever made.

Vincent is one of the last remaining naturally-born people on Earth. Prejudiced by all those around him, Vincent dreams the impossible dream of traveling to another planet and leaving his home forever. To do so, he takes on the identity of Jerome Merrow, a former swimmer with a handicap. Jerome is played by Jude Law. Sparks begin to fly as an investigation led by a determined detective (Alan Arkin) ensues in Jerome's office. A hidden romance also sparks between Jerome and the lovely Irene (Uma Thurman).The acting i the film is award-worthy and criminally overlooked. Ethan Hawke is restrained but potent as the all-but-lost Vincent. Uma Thurman is also fantastic as Irene. She plays the role in a split-persona style, making her character all the more real. Alan Arkin is also great as usual as the lead detective investigating the workplace. However, Jude Law steals the show as the real Jerome Merrow. Playing a dynamic supporting character, Jude conveys his changing attitude and emotions flawlessly, while still trying to take the spotlight off of himself. His actions at the end of the film, while I won't disclose them here, are also enormously deep and poetic. Mr. Law handles the performance perfectly, with just the right levels of charisma and sadness.

The very first shot we see is absolutely masterful, it almost has the feel of a counterfeit recording, although I can assure you it wasn't. Freddy and his homemade 'item', then a jumpy credits sequence replete with haunting music. It's the most effective way to open a horror story that I believe I can think of...Mostly the proceedings are kept tightly organised from thereon in. It's worth mentioning that I've never happened upon any male fans complaining about the plot featuring a teenage girl as the most resourceful character. It's a welcome change, and thankfully due to good scripting it never feels like a mistake or a crass gimmick. The ratio of 'dumb' victims is less than usual, too - you can't really blame them for succumbing to a predator who attacks them within the realm of their subconscious. The back story of the real Kreuger - let alone his spiritual manifestation - is sickening enough to conjure up some serious shivers. If I was nitpicking I'd say that the climax felt a bit rushed, but that hardly mattered considering that everything had been handled so well up until then, and this slight dip is more than compensated for by a terrific last shot, anyway. Finally, how could I fail to adore a fright-fest featuring the reliable and reassuring presence of the legend John Saxon as a concerned father? It ticks all the boxes, I tells ya!So much thought appears to have gone into the concept, and it's this attention to detail that helps it resonate. Freddy's sweater, for example, red and green because those colours clash horrifically... No wonder this sleeper effort put New Line on the map. It was the studio house that Freddy built, and it kick started my realisation that movies could leave a lasting imprint on the mind. 9-10, never sleep again?

The indoor gardens are a vast place filled with primitive plants that were once eaten by the dinosaurs -- the first dinosaurs, the herbivorous ones, not the flesh-eating dinosaurs that came later. Aunt Violet demonstrates the feeding of a carnivorous plant, the aptly name Venus flytrap, whose diet of live flies must be flown in at considerable expense during the winter months.Well, to let the cat out of the bag, Aunt Violet promises to fund a new building devoted to psychosurgery at Cucrovitz's underfunded state hospital if only he will do a slice-and-dice number on Catherine's frontal lobes and cut those lies out of her mind. The lies, as it turns out, aren't really lies. For years, first Aunt Violet and then Catherine acted as bait for attractive young men, whom Sebastian would then seduce -- two tummlers, one replacing the aging other. The operation does not take place.I don't know about Aunt Violet but Catherine would have made pretty good bait. When we first meet Elizabeth Taylor she is a patient in a psychiatric hospital with a diagnosis of dementia praecox (schizophrenia). She apologizes to Clift for her appearance. They don't let her groom herself. However, she looks okay. Her eyes are properly colored and though her hair is a bit messy and her dress a little drab, she has a magnificent bosom and a face that would light up a room. Clift himself was staggeringly handsome a few years earlier but had since been in a car wreck that ruined his good looks even as it cemented his friendship with Taylor, his co-star in George Stevens' superb A Place in the Sun. His acting, however, is up to par, despite the fact that by this time Clift was bombed and strung out from morning till night. Can't imagine how he remained so thin.The story is engaging, no doubt about it. Rich Aunt wants troublesome niece silenced by what amounts to medical murder. Lobotomies are no longer used, having been replaced by powerful and (mostly) effective anti-psychotic drugs. They were pretty brutal anyway, taking away extreme anxiety and the distress associated with terrifying symptoms, but also leaving behind little more than a raw and bleeding stub of the patient's original personality. This film is set in 1937. Two years later, the innovator responsible for lobotomies, Egon Munoz, won a Nobel prize in medicine for it.There's a problem with the screenplay. Williams' best play was Streetcar Named Desire. It was studded with short and flowery phrases, sometimes extending into brief, intense monologues. (Don't you just love these long rainy afternoons in N'Awlins? When an hour's not just an hour but a little piece of eternity dropped into our hands -- and who knows what to do with it? That's Blanche, just before she puts some moves on a teen aged boy.) In this film the flowery speeches come more often, and they're longer. Only a few minutes into the story and Aunt Violet is carrying on about the baby sea turtles being eaten by birds on the beaches of the Galapagos Islands. Catherine's big Reveal about Sebastian's homosexuality and his recruiting tactics is split into two parts. It's all a bit much, and these long speeches constitute an extreme demand on the performers. Hepburn is up to it because hers is shorter. Taylor gives it her best but it's almost too much and a viewer can sense the effort being put into it, the rising, almost hysterical pitch.The story lacks Streetcar's sense of place too, the ambiance. Arnold Malcom's scores have done yeoman work in other films, like The Bridge on the River Kwai, but Streetcar had Alex North's slouching, slightly menacing Southern rhythms and this film needs such support badly. Here we feel uneasily that Aunt Violet should be slashing her way through the jungle behind William Holden.Well, those speeches may be long and difficult to read out for the audience, but what imagery.

He has it all - but his life takes a dark turn after he has a lusty weekend fling with a beautiful client, Alex Forrest (Glenn Close). Dan sees it as nothing more than that, just a fling. But it meant much more to Alex... and soon Dan finds himself being stalked by Alex, and his resistance to continuing their relationship slowly drives her more and more insane, and her antics against Dan and his wife and daughter become increasingly violent... leading to a violent bloodbath (literally) of a finale.Very likely inspired by the 1971 Clint Eastwood thriller, Play Misty For Me, Fatal Attraction turned out to be one of the most popular movies of the 1980s, and is still referenced and talked about to this day. The plot is fairly straightforward - scorned lover takes revenge on resistant husband. It's been done before, but I can't recall anywhere that it's been done better than it was in this film. The way this premise is presented is wonderfully done and the writing here was excellent. All the dialog was realistic and the characters were believably written. Director Adrian Lyne displays some excellent camera-work as well, creating plenty of hysteria and panic at appropriate times with his quick and jittery shots and angles, and the clever inter-cutting of certain scenes (example being Beth frantically searching for her daughter while Alex rides a roller-coaster with her).The acting here is top-notch, especially from Glenn Close, who gave probably the biggest performance of her career as the mentally unhinged, violent lover who wants sweet revenge (take note that she was nominated for an Oscar as well, and deservedly so). Michael Douglas plays his character well, although he can be hard to sympathize with. Then again, Close's performance makes a good dynamic so this is forgivable. Anne Archer is also very good as Douglas' unsuspecting wife. As for the finale, well what a finale it is! Great conclusion to the story, and a really good thrill to end the film with. A bloodbath it is, literally.All in all, Fatal Attraction is an '80s film classic that still holds up well. As been said before, it is likely one of the most talked-about films of all time, and definitely one of the most popular films of it's time. Excellent acting, nice script, and some great thrills.

With this film, so begins the James Bond film franchise, which will impress, entertain and thrill audiences for years to come.Although part of the novel is cropped out for the film, Connery's powerful portrayal is probably what kept this film at bay. His intellectual wit and deadly charm is true to Fleming's original Bond. When he's talking, you wouldn't want to do anything else but just listen to him. When he's on the move, you wouldn't want to do anything else but just watch him do what he does best. His pronunciation of his most famous line Bond....James Bond is perhaps so full of ruggedness and class that it managed to find its way in my Top 5 Most Memorable Movie Quotes Ever.But Connery doesn't just share the spotlight. The gorgeous Ursula Andress is lovely as Honey Rider (I salute Fleming for giving names, especially Bond Girls and you would just stare at the screen and fantasize about her whenever you see her in that gorgeous bikini when she walks out of the water. Joseph Wiseman is just chilly as the megalomaniac villain of the title character Dr. No, whose plot for starting nuclear war for his own greediness still haunts viewers to this very day.The script simplifies the original novel, removing some key elements.

It's probably not a dish that's going to be to everyone's taste, or to each individual at every point in his or her life. But it represents both the pinnacle of the Hollywood musical of the 1950s and a charming homage to the lost Paris of the 1880s and 90s.Gigi (Leslie Caron) is a young coquette growing up in that rarified environment &#150; we first see her frolicking carelessly in the park as distinguished playboy Honore (Maurice Chevalier, in his best late-career role) extols the virtues of little girls, but soon she is thoroughly enmeshed in salon society as her high-strung aunties attempt to prepare her for the life of a courtesan for Paris' wealthy gentlemen. One gentleman in particular, sugar-baron Gaston (Louis Jourdan) enjoys the company of Gigi and her caretaker (Hermione Gingold) so much that he takes them on a seaside vacation, but he sees her only as a child. That gradually changes as Gigi grows into womanhood and Gaston becomes increasingly bored by society life and the kind of relationship he has with shallow courtesan Liane (Eva Gabor). Gaston decides to make Gigi his paramour, but when he takes her out to Maxim's nightclub and finds that in her attempt to please him she is simply mimicking her auntie (and bearing more than a slight resemblance to Liane, too), he storms out of the joint with a confused Gigi in tow. Gaston knows that he loves Gigi and he must decide between his freedom and his love, because he's realized that Gigi can't simply be another courtesan, another toy whose only purpose is to please the man she is with. Gigi is a spontaneous and willfull person, and Gaston doesn't want to destroy her freedom just to keep what's left of his.My personal opinion, as the above hints, is that Gigi is often a misunderstood film. Like its somewhat more famous predecessor My Fair Lady, the film is actually a polemical examination of gender power relationships &#150; in other words it can be seen as a feminist work of art, but it's one that's designed to make the viewer draw his\/her own conclusions. Interpretations abound regarding such elements as Honore's exhortation thank heaven for little girls &#150; mine is that the song is intended as satire, drawing Honore's and Gaston's chauvinism and fixation on youth to such an extreme as to make it ridiculous. Those who are offended by the song aren't thinking about it enough, and those who think its humor is unintentional (or politically incorrect) aren't giving enough credit to the sophistication of Minnelli and Lerner\/Loewe and their intended audience.Speaking of Lerner\/Loewe, they have here contributed one of the best original scores in the history of film. As far as I know only Say a Prayer is recycled (from Lady). It's a Bore is anything but; a fantastic way to introduce Gaston's character and the contrast between his attitude and Honore's. The Night They Invented Champagne is pure joy, and it's hard to doubt Gaston's sincerity as he flies around Paris exclaiming Gigi! While you were trembling on the brink, was I somewhere out there wink-ing at a star?. There's plenty of humor in the songs too, and we get a touching moment of rare introspection from Honore as he recalls (vaguely) his love for Gingold's character in a long-ago time in I Remember It Well. The songs really do a good job of advancing the story and representing the interior life of the characters, which is Minnelli's favorite thing to get into.This is one of Minnelli's masterpieces, and as such naturally one of the most psychologically complex of all romantic musicals. Every character wears a mask at some point or another. Honore seems to be completely carefree but finally reveals his softer side when confronted with the still-burning embers of his lost love. Gaston has more than one mask &#150; to begin with he often uses money and parties to hide his existential boredom, and in the end that ennui itself is exposed as a mask that he's built to protect HIMSELF from the realization of how much he needs love; it's the last vestige of his masculine pride. Gaston's resigned attitude comes to a head when he discovers his lover is cheating on him &#150; he becomes very angry and emotional, yet he doesn't want to confront the couple until Honore insists that it's his duty as a man. This is crucial &#150; I'm not suggesting that Gaston's boredom with social conventions is a fraud &#150; indeed it's far more sincere that Honore's concern with his honor (note the pun), but rather that he is using it to shield himself from deep or meaningful human contact. In other words, from recognizing the extent of his own powerlessness to control his fate. Even Gigi eventually wears a mask of sorts when she adopts the behavior and attitude that her aunt (Isabel Jeans) has convinced her will please Gaston. A lot of people I've talked to about the film seem confused as to why Gaston is so angry and emotional when he takes her away from Maxim's. I think that Gaston isn't angry at Gigi in any way, but rather that her behavior in this case has caused him to reflect on his OWN dupliciousness, the way that he's allowed himself to sacrifice what he really wants &#150; Gigi's unconditional love &#150; for what he believes is expected of him by the male-dominated society he lives in. His proposal not only paves the way for the consummation of Gigi and Garcon's love affair, but frees them from the oppressive weight of social conventions that threatened to poison their love and ultimately turn them against each other.
