But Disney saw that giving them a big role in the main storyline was the key to providing all the humor and suspense needed to spice up the predictable story. The leading mice, Gus and Jaq are delightful creations and the valiant band of mice are given amusing bits of business.Artistically, the animation art has a rather glossy modern look despite the fact that it's an old, old story from 1697, a classic children's fairy tale that has been done countless times as either a film, a play or a ballet. But this version will charm Disney fans young and old with its imaginative use of animation and a splendid collection of tuneful songs.A highlight is the 'Cinderella Work Song' in which the mice make a dress for the mistreated Cinderella, full of inventive comic touches and accompanied by the intricate blend of song and animation. Add to that 'So This Is Love', 'A Dream Is A Wish Your Heart Makes' and 'Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo' and you have a charming version of the Charles Perrault story.For villainy, the stepmother and her black cat (Lucifer) are two of the most brilliantly animated creatures in the film. The cat reminds me of a naughty black cat I once owned. The scene where the stepmother is stroking the cat as she gives Cinderella a list of chores is striking in its use of shadow and menace. Along with some dark touches, there is always a bubbling sense of humor, particularly in this sequence.Cinderella herself comes across as a pleasant heroine with a sense of humor herself, lifelike in her movements and one of Disney's more successful human figures. Disney's artists did greater art work in other films but this is a well-structured work, a great combination of music and clever animation. The pace is fast, even allowing for extended scenes of the mice and their shenanigans for the sub-plot. And Lucifer, the cat, makes a wonderful foil for their tricks.The Disney touch is evident in every scene and makes this charming blend of comedy, music and romance a film with timeless appeal.

In fact, looking back at Hitchcock's movies (which is unfair, since they've been made in a completely different era) I don't think he ever made movies written this well.For some reason most of the time film making starts with putting the director together with some of the best or most popular actors of that period. But this one certainly doesn't.... It shows that Polanski wrote this himself, with his close friend and film-writing-partner, because he really knows what this story is about - he knows where to be funny, where to make it tense, where to make things kind of 'sensual'.The weird thing is, that looking at all the things that happen in this movie, it's still so relatively shot, and doesn't feel at all too paced, or rushed. No, it rather feels like you are watching a 4 hour movie.Anyway, those who have ever lost track of someone (for a short moment) in a strange, big city or those who have ever tried to find out something in France, will know and recognize exactly what Harrison Ford's character is going through - people not taking you seriously, people who don't care, people who refuse (or aren't able) to help you in your own language. All these things are put in this movie, so well, that -at least for me- it is really very realistic.Most writers and directors nowadays seem to ruin most great movies\/thrillers by not being able to make a good ending to the developing story.

Roman Polanski has done this very well, by not making this story too complicated and slowly unraveling a -looking back- simple mistery.

Most movies just ignore these little facts, but Roman makes it always difficult for himself in order to make it more easy (or, more easy to believe) for us.There are no things that make me wonder 'how this is possible' - no, if you are a well known surgeon, many other surgeons from all over the world will know you. And if you will go to a convention in Paris, it's not at all unrealistic that you will run into a few of your friends...even when it's such a big city.

Hunchback has one of the best tracks to date...with nearly every song standing out (other than that stupid gargoyle song...its boring, overly cooky, and un intresting) especially God help the outcasts and hellfire, which is heard throught the movie as musical remixes. Overall this is one of the better Disney movies you can watch, it will surely keep adults intrest...and disney should make a trend of this more adult thing with an actual deep plot...crazy characters slipping on banana peels may be entertaining at first...but can get old fast..Disneys fully animated movies are becoming quite epic and deep while keeping a family friendly tone, which is the way it should be, and if kids get bored with that, they should stick with looney tunes until they are old enough to appreciate it....Peace out) ","genre":"Animation, Drama, Family"},{"date":"15 July 2001","score":"","review":"  When I cames out of the cinema, I has mixed thoughts about Shrek.

The acting from John Malkovich, Gerard Depardieu, Jeremy Irons and Gabriel Byrne is, for the most part, superb. Gabriel Byrne was by far the best though, probably because his character was more filled out, and also he was sooooo fine in this film....mmmmm...err, anyway, the ending and subsequent twist involving d'Artagnan, makes me cry almost every time I watch this film. Leo's acting wasn't too bad whilst he was Phillipe, but he was unconvincing as King Louis (Possible SPOILERS ahead). After reading some other people's gripes I'd like to point out a few things. First is that lots of people complained that the the Musketeers survived a volley of bullets being fired at them, getting away without a scratch. Well if these people had been watching properly, they would see the King's Musketeers shut their eyes and turn away, thus shifting their aim. Another thing to note is that the musket's of the day, although very high quality in the ranks of the Musketeers, had more chance of blowing up in your face than shooting the thing you were aiming at (it's like the movie myth that show heroes diving across the room firing a gun and killing 4 men. The chance of the hero hitting something smaller than a barn door acurately would be very slim). Also, afterwards a couple of the Musketeers are limping, my guess is that this is due to being shot in the foot by the King's Musketeers, particularly as it closes up on the feet of the charging Musketeers when in slow motion. The other gripe was the state of Phillipe's complexion after spending 6 years in an iron mask. Havn't you ever heard of moisturiser? Hehe ok so I know it almost certainly wasn't around then, but still they couldn't have him coming out of the mask looking like something out of an Egyption tomb, after all, he had to pass as King Louis. I will admit that a couple of things did annoy me a bit. The different ways that almost everyone pronounced the name 'd'Artagnan' and the names of the three Musketeers, due to accent was really getting on my nerves, although the accents themselves didn't bother me, after all if we were really being true to the story, the whole thing should have been in French (although Leo's accent was really beginning to grate by about 90mins into the film, but then I'm not that tolerant of him anyway). Another thing was Phillipe and Louis' wonderful hairdos. It was so obvious that someone had given him very bad extensions, wheras d'Artagnan's hair looked great (mmm, long hair...gah, I've really gotta stop doing that ^_^). Not a film for everyone, including those who are looking for a story close to the one that Alaxandre Dumas wrote, a historically correct movie, and those who are very into the action genre. Watch this film if you want drama with little bits of romance,action and comedy thrown in and you don't mind ending up prancing around pretending to be a Musketeer for the next three days ^_^ One for all, and all for one!

Still, if you're a fan of the games you may be disappointed. It did not have that huge, moving epic feel that the games have simply because it was too short.Let me start out by saying that I am a long time fan of the games. I was first introduced to Final Fantasy when the first game came out for the original Nintendo. But back then, I was more of a Dragon Warrior (Dragon Quest) fan and didn't give it much of a chance. I didn't become hooked until Final Fantasy IV came out in the US for Super Nintendo as Final Fantasy II in 1991. This game had it all; an epic story line, great character development, major plot twists, and beautiful music. I became a squaresoft addict, playing nearly every game they released. Now I am, 22, and still playing these games! I remembered dreaming about seeing Final Fantasy on the big screen, but eventually realized it would do much better as a series. The average Final Fantasy game is 50 hours long and the average movie is 110 minutes. An epic can probably be captured in a 3 hour film, but no less than that.Well, now the movie is out, and I was unfortunately correct. There didn't seem to be enough time to establish the characters or provide space for major plot twists. There were a few surprises here and there, but none of the major twists that made the game stories so interesting. Perhaps this is only the first part in a bigger story, it was semi- open ended after all, but on its own the story was rather bland. I think Square tried too hard to conform to the standard Hollywood formula action movie, and in the process lost a lot of the magic and originality that they created in the games.Another complaint I have has to do with the music. I understand Nobuo Uematsu has been rather busy with the now quite frequent releases of new Final Fantasy games, but I still missed his presence. The score was good for this movie and fit well with the action, but it was a standard action movie soundtrack, nothing really sticking out or particularly interesting like the music in the games. One might argue that movie soundtracks shouldn't get in the way of the action on screen, but there was nothing memorable. I guess I just miss the flowing harp, wild bass lines, and organ work that would make Keith Emerson proud that Mr. Uematsu has provided us in the games. His music has a very progressive, powerful, and epic sound not heard enough in movies.Okay, enough of the bad stuff. The best part about this movie was, as everyone mentioned, the visuals. Final Fantasy has certainly come a long way from the munchkin people of the first game. The action scenes were particularly good, and the designs of, well, everything was superb.Final Fantasy continuity enthusiasts (I know there are a few of you out there) may like the movie's story more than I gave it credit for. This movie fits quite well within the overall story and provides a frame of reference from which we can place the rest of the games. Since FF1-5 takes place in the past, and FF6-9 takes place in the future, this movie would have to have taken place after Final Fantasy V and before Final Fantasy VI. Therefore, it would have to take place several thousand years after the events in the OAV series. In fact, we finally have a year, 2065, which means this is the only Final Fantasy that takes place within the limited time span of the Christian Calendar. The Lunarians have already left our planet, and magic, monsters, and dragons has faded away on Earth. I don't want to spoil anything that happens in the movie, but let's just say that the humans finally get back in touch with the elemental spirits of the planet. Perhaps this triggers the return of the gifts the Lunarians left behind. This is a good logical setup for the war of the magi which takes place perhaps thousands of years later before Final Fantasy VI. Still, the continuity between the Final Fantasy games is vague at best as it is hinted at very subtly. Many do not believe that an overall story exists (although I and several others could provide a lot of evidence against that assumption).Don't worry if you don't understand any of the previous paragraph, this movie, as all Final Fantasy games, is a stand alone story, and no knowledge is required of previous Final Fantasy games. If you're a sf\/fantasy\/anime fan, you'll probably like this movie, it is reminiscent of Akira and Princess Monoke. Even if you're not a fan of any of that stuff, at least see this movie for the visuals alone. Believe me, it is nothing like you've ever seen, but don't expect too much out of the story.

It is though one of the worst in the last decade and definitely the worst Paul Verhoeven ever made.Having seen all his movies (from the days of The turkish delight, to the Verhoeven\/Ezsterhas soap-(don't-cross-your-legs)-epic, and of course the rest) I can say that in one thing he is absolutely serious He never, ever, takes his films serious. Definitely. So, if you watch Showgirls to find any inner meaning, anything more than the glamorous, glittering surface and the nude bodies floating on it... well, sorry, you lost.The nudity, yes. Verhoeven wanted to do a provoking film about the behind the scenes of the dazzling world of the big time shows. No problem. He grabs a wannabe (I'll show it all) star, gets a couple of good actors and a few dozens of nice bodies together, a poor excuse of a screenplay and... voila!

All the while the past is catching up to the present until the two timelines finally merge toward the end of the film.  The problem is that this is handled poorly; that is, it isn't handled at all.  It detracts from the film in a major way; since you can't get a grip on how everything relates chronologically, it makes things that much harder to understand.It is hard to truly grasp how the pay it forward concept got where it is.  We are told that pay it forward incidents have migrated from Las Vegas (the movie's setting) to Los Angeles but we never do find out how it made it there.  At first none of Trevor's (Haley Joel Osment) attempts at paying it forward seem to work, then suddenly the ball begins rolling, presumably propelled by magical fairies, since we have been shown nothing else to turn things around.  People and places impacted are flashed before us but the connections to the main plot are either small or nonexistent, and many of these people are forgotten as soon as their scene ends.  Just when you think you're going to learn all the connections, the scene switches.  The film is not merely chronologically disjointed but conceptually as well.There is a love story here between Mr. Simonet (Kevin Spacey) and Ms. McKinney (Helen Hunt), but it is one of those cases where the hand is forced by the film's adorable child, and then proceeds to take over the film.  Worse, it is the predictable kind of love story, a pattern that has been used in many a movie and seedy romance novel before this one.  It does not draw us in, other than a few tense moments where we learn about the characters' past.  There is no emotional connection in the film that you aren't force-fed.  This is script writing of the lowest caliber, when the writers are incapable of creating characters that draw out real responses and instead have to lead you around on an emotional leash.  You feel for the characters only because the movie commands you to, and thus you aren't truly feeling.  Well, you do feel something -- you feel used.  Even more so after the ending.Ah, the ending, which I am forced to partially spoil for you -- you might skip this paragraph.  Apparently the writers realized the lack of emotion in the film, so they resorted to the classic trump card killing a main character.  I will at least spare you precisely who dies (you can probably guess anyway), but the fact that it happens has to be mentioned here.  It occurs so suddenly and so out of line that you can't help but see it for what it is -- a sad attempt to salvage the movie by getting less observant people to shed some tears.  As much as I've panned things so far, the movie was actually reasonably good to this point, thanks to the performances -- but throwing this needless bloodshed in killed not only the character on screen, but the entire movie.  The moment is never truly built up so it becomes an artificial climax.  The song that ends the film is quite beautiful, but it drew more tears from myself that whatever was happening on the screen.The performances by Spacey, Hunt, and Osment are predictably stellar, and you might enjoy the film solely on that level.

So, it's kind of a time filler and it often shows. What Lies Beneath may have grossed a mint, but especially for someone like Zemeckis it is a relatively small film. No Vietnam wars or meetings with presidents, no time-traveling and no contact with aliens, just a haunted house. And I'm not talking a The Haunting-style castle here. Just a house. Of course, smaller doesn't necessarily mean less good (not that I'm a fan of Zemeckis' past works, though, because to me, he's still a Spielberg protege and not much of a distinctive director).What Lies Beneath is a halfway house between paranormal thriller and pure Hitchcock. The ghostly apparitions and the supernatural angle make up for the first element and the subplot with the neighbours and the way it's directed make up for the second. Also, the bathtub which plays a central role recalls Psycho, as does the basic structure of the script. For me, however, the movie falls short on both levels. On the Hitchcock level, mainly because the script is godawfully predictable (even without seeing what must be the most spoiler-ish trailer I've ever seen) and because no matter how hard I tried, there just didn't seem te be any deeper psychological meaning (or even logic) to it. Compared to Hitch's works, this is a high-gloss piece of emptiness. As a paranormal thriller it fails, because it really isn't about anything paranormal, it's just uses it as an audience-luring angle and a plot device. That makes What Lies Beneath feel like Strange Days. Yes, I know, they're very different films, but both films use interesting ideas (WLB ghosts, Strange Days recorded memories, cyberpunk) and reduce them to a plot device in a tired an old way. What Lies Beneath never delves into what ghosts are (ok, pretty obvious) or, more importantly, why they are. If you want to see a real ghost film, go rent The Sixth Sense. The second reason it doesn't work is it's use of shock tactics. I did jump twice, but in a movie with about fifteen jump moments, that's a lousy batting average. They are all build-up and no pay-off.Well, I shouldn't be all that negative, because What Lies Beneath is not all that uncomfortable viewing. The simple 'ghostly' scenes, like the one in which a door opens twice, miraculously, work very well. Also, the film's shot in a cold way, making for an often chilling film. Furthermore, the quality production values and the continuing promise of some form of surprise make it highly watchable. In fact the whole film feels like its jump moments. The build-up is good and will keep you interested but don't be surprised if the jump never follows. Of course I'm referring to the final act. Up until the point the proverbial penny drops it's solid entertainment. The problem is, you're waiting for a breathtaking, surprising or satisfying ending and you get nothing like that.Finally there's the acting, which boils down to the performances of it's two leads, Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer. Pfeiffer is the actual lead and pulls it off well enough. Most of the time, she is very convincing as the woman questioning her sanity as much as her surroundings. Harrison Ford, trying a supporting role this time (despite his being first billed), seems totally miscast.In short Apparently for Zemeckis, smaller DOES mean less good.

So those that like adventure and romance just open your mind to the mythical China setting lay back and watch one of the greatest films of all-time. 10\/10         ","genre":"Action, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"15 July 2001","score":"","review":"  I went to see this movie tonight hoping to see a halfway decent romance, but not expecting much, so I was very pleasantly surprised when I really, really enjoyed this movie.I guess what I enjoyed most about it was that it had plenty of depth.

Well, just like those sweaters your Aunty used to give you for Christmas or the toys you got for your birthday, this movie is a gift that you would rather forget about as quickly as you decided to go and see it.For those of you out there with a sense of respect or feeling that some talent lies within Mr. Keanu Reeves, then you would be well advised to give this movie a very wide berth. Hollywood producers do not usually mis-cast actors, but when they do they do it big-time. The result is an almost laughable representation of Reeves as the skinny wimp who, once given a full, healthy beard (which could have been stuck on for that matter) is expected to be transformed into a figure that all fear and none dare challenge. Hooey!However, the said actor is not alone in the ridiculous nature of the plot and talent made (mis-) use of in this movie. The protagonist, Ms. Blanchett is a widow, left to raise 3 small children after her husband is sent to his untimely death by an explosion at his place of work (an incident the fortune-teller 'quite-but-not-completely-anticiapted-yet-not-in-a-very-convincing-enough-ki nd-of-way'). This sets the scene for a family comprised of four people who, if able to break a smile is soon reminded that tragedy is everywhere and sadness is a fact of life, so get used to it. Cue Reeves, a man who is about to make this quasi-tragic setting seem like a walk in the park. If ever you wanted a reason for why Reeves was not the murderer in Scream, calling up his victims prior to making his attack then here it is. Listen to him on the phone and see if you are even vaguely interested in what he has to say...However, the movie is not without it's attractions. Like Giovanni Ribisi, who, if ever there was a man worthy of the award for Best Schizo in a Supporting Role never fails to entertain with his outstandingly outrageous outbursts the two that immediately spring to mind are firstly, an emergency stop worthy of a manual on how to get your driving license... with style! and secondly an attack on a vehicle with a crow-bar worthy of how to lose your..... All good stuff.And finally there is the ending. Though I am not one to spoil endings (I will leave it up to the movie to do that) I would appreciate somebody giving me their 'take' on what it was intended to achieve.

Well, just like those sweaters your Aunty used to give you for Christmas or the toys you got for your birthday, this movie is a gift that you would rather forget about as quickly as you decided to go and see it.For those of you out there with a sense of respect or feeling that some talent lies within Mr. Keanu Reeves, then you would be well advised to give this movie a very wide berth.

This sets the scene for a family comprised of four people who, if able to break a smile is soon reminded that tragedy is everywhere and sadness is a fact of life, so get used to it.
