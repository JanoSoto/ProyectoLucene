[{"date":"7 May 2011","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Young Lola (Franka Potente) is in love with Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu). He needs the 100,000 Marks he has lost or he'll be killed by the mafioso he has to pass them on in 20 minutes. Lola has a plan to find the money, and take it to Manni on time so he lives. She's on the run.The movie starts with two quotes selected by director Tom Tykwer. The first, by poet T. S. Eliot, says, We shall not cease from exploration and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time. The second, by German soccer coach S. Herberger, says, after the game is before the game. Unlike other movies, these are not pedantic quotations, but are really directly linked to the way the story is presented and filmed.The story is shot three times, with slight differences regarding the positioning of the actors, slightly different timing in the action, and changes in the possible scenes, which produce dramatically different endings and future predictions for all the characters. Only the scene regarding Lola's mum, shot in pastels while she's talking on the phone, does not change in the movie. Unlike other movies of the sort, this is not a pre-deterministic movie. The message of the movie, to me, is that the fact that you ran faster doesn't mean that you're gonna get there earlier. For that to happen, you'll need to run in the right direction, at the proper pace, and have a bit of luck. Life is a game, a net of chances, and minor changes bring dramatic different endings. Lola has three different ways of approaching the same challenge, and has three lives, like in a video-game, to succeed.Although the movie is action-packed, its core is grounded in the deep love the couple has, which is explained in infra-red colored flashbacks with both characters in bed talking about their relationship. Without that, the movie would have been just another ran and catch story. Another great thing is that the roles are reversed in this film the hero is a woman trying to rescue her man from trouble, not the opposite; she takes the lead, she is the one running and making things happen.The movie was shot in three different formats, steady video-cam for the running action scenes, 35mm movie cam (color, BW and infrared) for the settled steady scenes, with an important animated clip that serves as credits opening but then becomes part of the story. The movie contains present, past and future action, and uses split screens effectively to show relevant events happening to both Manni and Lola.Colour is very important in this movie, but not overwhelmingly so. There are very bright color enhancements that break the visual monotony of the urban settings and the settled interior scenes Lola's red-orange hair perfectly matches her blue-green pastel outfit, the orange ambulance, the men in yellow carrying the big glass, the blood-red telephone, and the infra-red scenes, among others. Moreover, the flashbacks are shot in B&W, while the flash-forwards of the secondary characters are shot in subdued colors, very much like a worn out movie of the 1970s would look like.I loved the OST and selection of songs, whose lyrics perfectly describe what is happening in the story, and the mood of the characters and scene at the precise moment it is playing. The beat of the movie, the one that gives its pace and rhythm to it, is the techno-song sung by Potente, a catchy powerful and repetitive piece that also matches perfectly Lola's determination and angst; it has also something of video-game music, in a way, as the running without the music would look somewhat deflated.Franka Potente honors her surname and has a great energy in this film. She runs with a great easiness and power. She is also able to stop and act dramatically, be sweet, nasty, crazy - always fresh and believable. Moritz Bleibtreu shows a great dramatic talent to showcase his character in the few minutes that he has on camera. The rest of the cast are also good in their respective roles (Herbert Knaup as Lola's father; Nina Petri as Frau Hansen, the mistress of Lola's father; Armin Rohde as bank security guard Schuster, and Ludger Pistor as Mr Meier, among others).Two main flaws. The opening of the movie after the credits, with hundred of people moving around and some questions being posed to the spectator, is really pretentious, and I thought does not add anything to the script or the movie in general, especially because the two initial quotations already establish the concept around which the movie revolves. There is goof, too, in the scene of Lola talking to Manni trough the glass window of the supermarket, which has no verisimilitude; however, the mood and energy of the film is such at that moment that this does not matter or bother the viewer, who believes it.A great action movie, super-entertaining, with more depth that one can think at first sight.

The director of the first two movies, Terence Young, returned to direct this one and it would be his last Bond film. Sean Connery returns once again as 007, Adolfo Celi was casted as the villain Largo, and the eye candy is provided by Claudine Auger as the good girl and Luciana Paluzzi as the bad girl.The international criminal organization SPECTRE is at it again. Their agent Emilio Largo has stolen two nuclear devices and the whole world is held hostage. While on a health clinic in England James Bond gets a lead on Largo and follows him to Nassau. There he meets Largo's mistress Domino whom Bond tries to get to help him. However, SPECTRE's top assassin Fiona Volpe is on to 007.Thunderball is not a bad movie, but it does have couple problems. It simply can't live up to the expectations left by the three previous films in the series. The movie tries very much to be another From Russia with Love, an intense spy thriller with action on the side, but simply can't get there. The same thing bothers actors. Connery still plays the part well but you can see it is becoming a routine. Adolfo Celi and Claudine Auger both do a competent job, but they simply don't live up to previous Bond villains and girls.The other thing that bothers the film is that it drags a bit towards the end. The first hour in the film goes well but after that the whole finding the nuclear devices takes longer than needed and the final underwater battle could have been shorter as well. The film simply gets a bit boring at times.As said though, Thunderball is not a bad movie and it has many enjoyable moments in it. The opening intro where Bond uses the famous, though silly looking, rocket jet-pack to escape, the SPECTRE briefing scene where mysterious faceless leader executes a traitor, Bond's unrelenting attempts to seduce a nurse in health clinic and the already mentioned underwater battle, though long very beautiful, are all worth the watch. The settings are beautiful and actors know what they're doing. Not to mention Tom freaking Jones sings the opening theme.To sum it up, Thunderball is a bit of a letdown after the first three brilliant Bond films but it doesn't belong with the very worst of the series either.

Basically the Larabee family are very rich, and the two sons do their own things, Linus (Humphrey Bogart) runs the family corporate empire and has no time for a personal life, and David (William Holden) is employed by the family but never shows up spending time having fun and being married and divorced three times. Young and awkward chauffeur's daughter Sabrina Fairchild (Oscar and BAFTA nominated Audrey Hepburn) has had a crush on David since childhood, but he has never really noticed her, until he returns home after two years from Paris. She is more elegant, sophisticated and beautiful and she seems to have finally caught the playboy's attention, not recognising her, she is happy to finally be gaining his interest, but Linus is worried. David is already engaged to be married to another woman, if the wedding doesn't go ahead a big corporate deal will go bust, so workaholic Linus starts a friendship with Sabrina to draw her away. In the process however it seems that she may be falling in love with her, and he returns the same feelings, so much so that when he tells her to go back to Paris, he dashes to leave with her on the boat. Also starring Walter Hampden as Oliver Larrabee, John Williams as Thomas Fairchild, Martha Hyer as Elizabeth Tyson, Joan Vohs as Gretchen Van Horn, Marcel Dalio as Baron St. Fontanel, Marcel Hillaire as The Professor, Nella Walker as Maude Larrabee, Francis X. Bushman as Mr. Tyson and Ellen Corby as Miss McCardle. Hepburn is radiant and elegant as the shy young woman, Bogart is cool and charming as the tough guy, and Holden does alright as his brother, the direction by Wilder is good, the story when it made sense was not bad with some soppy and funny stuff, I can't quite agree with five stars out of five, but it is I suppose a worthwhile romantic comedy. It won the Oscar for Best Costume Design, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography and Best Writing, Screenplay, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay. Humphrey Bogart was number 36, and Audrey Hepburn number 13 on The Greatest Movie Stars, Hepburn was number 31 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, Bogart was number 1 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, and he was number 27 on The World's Greatest Actor.

Since then, he has started making American movies that seem almost misogynistic in it's attitudes to women. His films put their female protagonist through horrifying and gruelling psychological and physical abuse. But the controversy stirred up by The Idiots wasn't because of its portrayal of women, but its apparently sadistic mockery of the mentally disabled.The film follows a bunch of young men and women, living together in a large house owned by the uncle of Stoffer (Jens Albinus), who spend their time pretending to be mentally ill and finding their 'inner idiot'. They pick up an apparently lost woman Karen (Bodil Jorgensen) at a restaurant and she joins them, equally fascinated and repulsed by their acts. As Karen searches for her inner idiot, the group continue to 'spas' (Danish equivalent of 'spaz') at various locations, seemingly for their own amusement. Stoffer is meant to be selling the house for his uncle, but since the group has settled their, he uses the group as a means to scare away any potential buyers. However, tensions start to develop in the group, mainly due to the increasingly aggressive and unpredictable behaviour of the unstable Stoffer.It's difficult to work out who exactly Von Trier is poking fun at. It could be the group themselves, who claim to be anti-bourgeois and anti- middle class, yet seem to only use this claim when it frees them from responsibility. A member of the group, who has run away from his wife and his child, thinks about returning, only to describe the thought of pushing his child around in a pram as 'so middle class'. Or the film could be making fun of society's attitudes to the mentally disabled. When a potential buyer for the house is told by Stoffer that a house for the mentally ill has opened next door, the woman is clearly uncomfortable at the idea of them encroaching on their ideal middle class existence. When the group surrounds her, she panics and flees, most likely never to return. It is not a film that lays out its purpose as clear as day. If there is a social message in the film at all is again unclear. What is clear is that The Idiots is a challenging, frustrating, funny, intelligent and extremely uncomfortable film. Von Trier's desire to be as controversial as possible has been evident in the majority of his films - the clitoris removal in Antichrist, the cold, brutal ending of Dancer In The Dark. I usually find annoying in a filmmaker (Gaspar Noe comes to mind, apart from his exceptional Irreversible), but Von Trier's ability to genuinely unsettle is the work of an extremely interesting and gifted filmmaker. Although it breaks many of the rules, The Idiots is the second film in the Dogme '95 manifesto, started by Thomas Vinterberg's Festen, using natural light, hand-held cameras, and avoiding anything implicating genre or superficial action. The film also depicts apparently un- simulated hardcore sex, in a highly controversial scene in which the group take place in a gang-bang while in their 'idiot' character-mode.A love-it-or-hate-it film, but I found it truly original and fascinating. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com ","genre":null},{"date":"7 May 2011","score":"","review":" Never one to shy from a bit of controversy, Danish director Lars Von Trier caused a storm in 1998 with The Idiots.
