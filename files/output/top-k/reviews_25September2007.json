[{"date":"25 September 2007","score":"","review":" Queen Elizabeth I, the Virgin Queen, was monarch at a pivotal time in England's history, and one of the longest reigning monarchs (over 40 years). This biopic studies her early years, starting in her teens at a time when her infamous father had decreed she should not be in the line of succession to the throne, through the years of court intrigue she endured, into her ascension to the throne, and the early years of her reign.The focus is on the struggles of the daughter of the ill-fated and disgraced Anne Boleyn to establish her birthright, and then to hold on to it once achieved. Although there are some aberrations to true historical fact, good insight into Elizabeth's challenges are given. One example of historical liberties taken is the portrayal of her half-sister Mary considering murdering her. Most historians agree the Mary and Elizabeth were very close sisters. Cate Blanchett resembles (paintings of) the long reigning queen, and her performance is of a strong and confident woman, a leader not just by blood line, but possessing the unique qualities that make for an effective leader.Of note is the superior cinematography and lighting tecniques to establish mood. Deep hues for troublesome times, bright exuberant colors for lighter moments. For example, Mary, depicted as evil and a danger to Elizabeth, was always shrouded in dark, poorly lit rooms.Successes and failures of Elizabeth's later years will be documented in the sequel coming out this year, while this first installment leaves off after the first few years of her reign. They were difficult years, to say the least. A cheating lover, traitors, despisers, pretenders to the throne, an oddball suitor, dangers from France and Spain, etc.A worth while film, which, in spite of some inaccuracies, brings the famous queen to life.

","genre":"Biography, Drama, History"},{"date":"25 September 2007","score":"","review":" The only spoof movie I saw starring Leslie Nielsen before this one was Spy Hard, and like so many others, I did not care much for it. However, knowing that The Naked Gun From the Files of Police Squad! was a lot more popular (as I'm sure you can tell by comparing the IMDb ratings), I watched it with relatively high expectations. I found virtually no laughs in Spy Hard, but found many in this police spoof, which proves that the mediocrity of SH has nothing to do with Nielsen's starring role.Detective Nordberg, a member of Police Squad, is shot multiple times during an investigation, and is nearly killed! While he is in the hospital, a fellow member of Police Squad, the clumsy Lieutenant Frank Drebin, must investigate this attempted murder. While on the case, Drebin eventually finds proof that Vincent Ludwig, a local businessman, plans to have the Queen of England assassinated during her visit in L.A.! Unfortunately, Drebin accidentally burns the proof of this assassination plot (he ends up burning a lot more than that), and Ludwig is a very well-respected individual, so how will the clumsy detective convince anyone of this sinister plan?!A ton of slapstick is featured in this spoof, and as big a fan as I am of the type of humour, I have to admit that this film may overdo it a bit at times, making some of the gags a tad too predictable. Fortunately, most of the movie doesn't have this problem. In fact, the jokes are often hilarious, whether they are physical gags, or comical lines! For better or worse, there are also some tasteless gags here and there, such as in the scene early in the film where Lieutenant Frank Drebin visits Detective Nordberg in the hospital. If you're into silly spoof movies and slapstick, and are generally not irked by raunchiness and\/or tastelessness, I highly recommend The Naked Gun From the Files of Police Squad! for you!
