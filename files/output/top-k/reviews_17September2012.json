Her psychotic brother escapes from the asylum where he has been committed, then descends on her new home and starts hacking his way through her house mates.This slasher film is almost completely devoid of interest. It seems to derive its ideas from Halloween (1978) and A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984). From the former the basic storyline is taken and the latter provides the idea of a killer inhabiting the heroine's dreams. I'm not really saying that something totally derivative is automatically a bad thing. Sometimes more of the same is perfectly acceptable. No, the problem here is that movie is very dull. We have the usual assortment of knuckle-headed teens and a boring killer who is as inhuman as usual. It's too safe for its own good. It's not especially gory or sleazy. It's just bland; a coffee table slasher. Seemingly it spawned a sequel so I guess it has its advocates. I suppose fans of 80's slashers might get a kick out of it.

I think this was the very first Bond movie I ever watched back when I was 15. I wasn't too impressed with it then but going back over the film as I watch the series in order, I think I'm even less impressed with it. There's no question that it's a decent movie with some amazing stunts but I think there are just a few too many weak spots that keep it from really being good. I think the biggest problem were the villains themselves. Not for a second did I really enjoy any of them as they just felt like weak copies of a mixture of villains we had seen previously in the series. The terrorist Xenia Onatopp has a great name, an interesting way to kill people but the entire character was just too silly and unbelievable for me. I think Brosnan did a good job in his role as Bond as he plays it a bit more seriously than some in the past. I thought his one-liners were rather good and there's no question that the actor could handle the action and sexuality. I also enjoyed Scorupco in her role as she was charming and really mixed it up well with the lead. Joe Don Baker and Judi Dench were good in their parts but the scene stealer is without question Desmond Llewelyn returning as Q in a very memorable sequence. The action scenes start off with a great bang and get even better as we see Bond falling from a cliff and trying to catch up with a running airplane that has fallen from the same cliff. Could this ever happen? No but it was fun to watch. The rest of the action scenes looked good but I still think they were just missing a certain something.

The plot builds on two intertwining developments First, Shakespeare's in love with Viola de Lesseps; second, the production of Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet . These two developments are weaved into a tight and intertwining story through the dual identities of Viola and the dual roles (on and out of stage) of everyone involved in the production.

The director and the actors did wonderful job to deliver a perfect timing in many those hilarious moments created by those dualities.The movie is delightfully fast-paced (a lot of running, and even fighting&#x97;on or off the stage), and potently lean (no excessive dialogues or unnecessary scenes). Even the complicated scene like the party, which Shakespeare first met Viola, is done with efficiency and simplicity. Besides the great performance by Gwyneth Paltrow and Joseph Fiennes, Collin Firth was wonderful in Lord Wessex role.

The movie The Anderson Tapes (1971) already depicted wall-to-wall surveillance by numerous government agencies as a robbery plot unfolded. In Enemy of the State, the National Security Agency (NSA), which exists, has hugely enhanced surveillance capabilities with satellites and on-ground teams, as in The Conversation (1974). Gene Hackman, wearing glasses, appears in both of the latter two movies.Jon Voight is a rogue NSA bureaucrat who directs operations. He and some of his team kill a Congressman (Jason Robards) who is standing in the way of a bill in Congress that extends their surveillance powers. (By now, such powers are common, so that art has preceded reality or quickly intuited it as is often the case.) Ironically, the murder is filmed by a bird watcher. When Voight hears of this, he sets his teams to work recovering the film, murdering more people, and covering up. Will Smith comes into possession of a disk with the film, and he becomes the harried and threatened protagonist, later assisted by an irascible ex-NSA agent (Gene Hackman). The movie plays out as a fairly conventional decent thriller.I found interesting the depiction of the hands who do Voight's dirty work of the actual surveillance and murder. He has two teams with these separate functions. They are young, their clothing doesn't identify them, and they are glued to their electronic devices just as if they were any youths you might see playing video games intensely, only their toys are far more sophisticated. The kill-team has more young men who do their searching, running, and gun-pointing work without hesitation. They do not kill indiscriminately at all, but they will if ordered to. The State cannot operate without the loyalty and unswerving obedience of these young men. I have the feeling that they believe in what they do (that they are the good guys and their superiors identify the bad guys for them), but also their superiors know how to exploit their psychology. These young men like the taste of the chase, the hunt, the power, the action, the voyeurism, and the winning, plus they are submissive to boot. It was annoying for me to see these young squirts operating like little Nazis. Is this real? I mean, does this portrayal capture some elements of reality among those who serve? I think it does. Liberty is in huge danger from a government that recruits and trains such people, and from the millions who know nothing of it or approve of it.In the end, here's another irony. These submissive men who always take orders have to make a decision on their own when Voight is in danger, and they make a hasty, emotional and wrong decision, which is their downfall and his too. Under pressure to think straight, they fail to do so. Their capacities are purely mechanical. They are linked as one to their computer screens and electronic signals. Their minds have atrophied in other ways. In fact, the movie never shows these young men as characters or persons. They are not developed as such in the screenplay. This is fitting.Voight is given several speeches in which he justifies the NSA's spying. The movie is not unbalanced. Nevertheless, since he commits a crime and since Will Smith is the hero, the movie comes down on the side of controlling the surveillance and spying capacities of government. Will Smith's wife delivers opinions that take that point of view, so there is a kind of debate in the script. However, it's a thriller. The movie does stop and focus on the human element a bit when Will Smith's former girl friend (Lisa Bonet) is murdered, but it is not particularly strong in bringing out the negatives of surveillance. The bird watcher is killed, for example, and the movie quickly moves on. It has to, in some sense, because he is not a major character.Voight is a rogue within the NSA. We are not given all that much direct intimation that the government is vastly overreaching, and that its power against individuals is crossing a line into police state. Yet the movie does leave that general impression. I am sure that other Hollywood thrillers have explored in more depth the excesses of the State itself. If not, they will. And they will be getting into scenarios in which the President becomes a dictator. I've seen a good many foreign movies that go back 20-30 years, like those by Costa-Gavras, that are simultaneously excellent thrillers while exploring government oppressions of various kinds and focusing more intensely on the effects this has on individual persons. These are not done in the more or less standardized Hollywood style that tends to veer off into superficial entertainment.None of this stops or has stopped the State's progression, but it doesn't hurt to raise public awareness of the growing police state via popular entertainment like this.

Especially in the final scene where the music will stay with you for long after the credits end.The acting First rate across the board. These people could have been real for all I know.This film will divide audiences because of it's subject matter, but it's one of the best, lesser-known, low-budget foreign offerings you're likely to see. The current 6.8 rating is an absolute travesty. I was expecting to see about 7.8, and that's why I decided to write this review.This is a disturbing film, and one that I can highly recommend.It IS better than American History X.86\/100You Might Like THis if you Liked American History X(good, but not as good), THe Boys Next Door(perhaps the last time a low-budget, dramatic film disturbed me this much - not as good as this though), American Me(not quite as good as this), Boyz in the Hood(better), Tzameti 13(not as good).

I remember, quite vividly and with a pleasant vibe, how moved my friend and I genuinely felt when we first watched it together. These were in the days when Blockbuster was still around and when it was more monetarily feasible as well as logical to go out to your local movie store and rent a movie to watch with your friend; this was, with all due respect, before the current and giant economic melt-down that we are all experiencing. So, to set the scene and mood of the period in which we watched this film for the first time, the candles were lit, and my friend and I were seated eating gummy bears, and we stayed up and watched that sucker into the wee hours of the morning, cat-sitting. The economy was better, then, for sure, we all know, but, we were having a hell of a time (now my friend is away, teaching English abroad, in Korea, soon to retire there, though; she's had enough of it, as the lifestyle and the culture were just generally getting on her nerves, and she felt she had achieved what she wanted). Well, basically, the Shawshank Redemption is all about solitary confinement in a small, insulated, but high-security prison in middle-to-Southern Ohio, set in the '50s. Morgan Freeman and his white counterpart in the film (race was a factor back then), partner up to give each other moral support and courage during a very tough time for them both. The part that struck me most about this film, though, was that Tim Robbins, or, the character played by Tim Robbins, was put into solitary confinement, where food was shoved in his little cell in an unsanitary manner, and he was treated, as the proverb or saying goes, like a dog; and where he couldn't see nor hear from anyone for a long, long time; it was verifiable torture. In addition, Morgan Freeman, who plays someone who is, like Tim Robbins, on the death row, plays your average cool-cat gentleman who was convicted for the murdering of his wife or something, but who claims he didn't do it. There are many cafeteria scenes where the two bond joyously over their own jokes and jiving, and where they eventually become better friends. Basically, the two bond over their common suffering, and help each other through their sorrow. Indeed, Bob Gunton also plays in the film, a man who plays the jail-owner, or something. He appears, in real life, to be much older than either Robbins or Freeman, born in October of 1959, and 1937, respectively. Robbins notably graduated with honors from the drama program of UCLA in 1981, then went on to do other great things, such as forming the Actor's Gang Theatre Group, which expressed radical political views as seen through a European lens. In addition, Robbins has received many dramatic awards, and continues to do sporadic work in film. Freeman, of course, is the mighty train who continues to do well in whatever he does, and is well-liked by all, really. Bob Gunton has a tendency for playing strict, militaristic, authoritarian roles when it comes to his film-work, and he plays the role in the notable movie of The Shawshank Redemption. There are several intense scenes in the movie, The Shawshank Redemption, and many of them include the showing of the intense pain of both Freeman and Robbins, as they elude their grief. Robbins, in particular can't take the pain of being locked-up so to speak and often shouts, screams intensely out of frustration with having no one to talk to, and out of mental and emotional pain.

It is an utterly joyless exercise, one that seems to drag on to no end, and leading nowhere good. Whenever it's not flat-out boring, it is absolute revolting, generating more twists in my stomach than most gross-out horror films have accomplished. In terms of sheer disgust, it ranks pretty close with Roger Corman's dreadful Galaxy of Terror. This may be worse, however. For Galaxy of Terror used mostly slime-coated rubber monsters and gallons of blood, but it's lowlight was an infamous rape scene involving a giant worm and a human female. Very nearly disgusting is this movie's lowlight a near-sex scene (consensual, mind you!) between a human female and a duck from outer space.The most shocking thing is that this sequence and many others are contained in a movie meant to not only be a comedy, but a comedy for children. Why, I cannot imagine. I admit I am not familiar with the original comic book material, save for a few cover photos I have seen. The Howard the Duck from the comics, to me, resembled a chain-smoking caricature of Donald Duck. Well, the duck here smokes, as well. He also cusses, is a master of Quack-Fu, is libidinous toward human females, and is one of cinema's most entirely unsympathetic so-called protagonists. The movie would like us to laugh and empathize with Howard, but my morals refused to. Straight from the beginning, Howard is an unlikable little twerp, and he remains an unlikable little twerp. I do grant that the special effects used to create him are fairly good. His bill opens and closes smoothly and with lip movement, his eyes do not merely sit in their sockets, and the suit movement is decent enough. But taking this vulgar character from the comics and making him into a likable figure was a tough challenge, and clearly the screenwriters were not up to it.Speaking of the screenwriters, is it a coincidence that the storytellers of this fiasco were the same duo who wrote Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom? Both films are unnecessarily grim, clumsily juggle whimsy with nightmare images, and are simply difficult to endure. Howard the Duck is very much the same, except, unlike Temple of Doom, it does not have a director who can produce some nevertheless redeeming features. What it does have are those same traits I mentioned above, as well as disturbing moments such as one where a group of bikers and truck drivers in a roadside café strap Howard down to a table and try to behead him with a kitchen knife. Decapitation is one of the more disturbing means of execution; it should be used sparingly in the movies, let alone kids' movies. Just the idea of it is disturbing. And what do the makers of Howard the Duck do in an attempt to soften the scene? They have Lea Thompson, who is, by the way, the duck's human companion, plead Don't kill him! He's my boyfriend! A truck driver responds That is disgusting! A true statement, but not the least bit funny.There are numerous other would-be gags, which include a female duck with creepily humanoid breasts sitting in her bathtub; a waitress saying We don't allow pets on the premises!; the constant wisecracks for citizens who see Howard for the first time; Howard scaring a group of children.The people in the movie don't fare much better. Miss Thompson is whimsical and easy on the eyes, but she's too dizzy to be charming. There is also Tim Robbins doing a decent-enough job and occasionally forcing a grin out of me. The only other person on-screen long enough to be worth mentioning is Jeffrey Jones, who is stone-faced when a scientist and goofily over-the-top when possessed by a demon from outer space. They are also surrounded by a lot of production design and special effects, some of which are dazzling. The dust we see floating around in outer space and the lights spewing from a giant proton machine are pretty, and the climax of the movie features an excellently animated stop-motion insect. He should get his own movie. But Howard the Duck is too lopsided and gross-factor-heavy to beguile an audience. It is a stomach-twisting disgust most of the time and insufferably boring the rest of the time.

What it does have are those same traits I mentioned above, as well as disturbing moments such as one where a group of bikers and truck drivers in a roadside café strap Howard down to a table and try to behead him with a kitchen knife. Decapitation is one of the more disturbing means of execution; it should be used sparingly in the movies, let alone kids' movies. Just the idea of it is disturbing. And what do the makers of Howard the Duck do in an attempt to soften the scene? They have Lea Thompson, who is, by the way, the duck's human companion, plead Don't kill him! He's my boyfriend! A truck driver responds That is disgusting! A true statement, but not the least bit funny.There are numerous other would-be gags, which include a female duck with creepily humanoid breasts sitting in her bathtub; a waitress saying We don't allow pets on the premises!; the constant wisecracks for citizens who see Howard for the first time; Howard scaring a group of children.The people in the movie don't fare much better. Miss Thompson is whimsical and easy on the eyes, but she's too dizzy to be charming. There is also Tim Robbins doing a decent-enough job and occasionally forcing a grin out of me. The only other person on-screen long enough to be worth mentioning is Jeffrey Jones, who is stone-faced when a scientist and goofily over-the-top when possessed by a demon from outer space. They are also surrounded by a lot of production design and special effects, some of which are dazzling. The dust we see floating around in outer space and the lights spewing from a giant proton machine are pretty, and the climax of the movie features an excellently animated stop-motion insect. He should get his own movie. But Howard the Duck is too lopsided and gross-factor-heavy to beguile an audience. It is a stomach-twisting disgust most of the time and insufferably boring the rest of the time.

It is an utterly joyless exercise, one that seems to drag on to no end, and leading nowhere good. Whenever it's not flat-out boring, it is absolute revolting, generating more twists in my stomach than most gross-out horror films have accomplished. In terms of sheer disgust, it ranks pretty close with Roger Corman's dreadful Galaxy of Terror. This may be worse, however. For Galaxy of Terror used mostly slime-coated rubber monsters and gallons of blood, but it's lowlight was an infamous rape scene involving a giant worm and a human female. Very nearly disgusting is this movie's lowlight a near-sex scene (consensual, mind you!) between a human female and a duck from outer space.The most shocking thing is that this sequence and many others are contained in a movie meant to not only be a comedy, but a comedy for children. Why, I cannot imagine. I admit I am not familiar with the original comic book material, save for a few cover photos I have seen. The Howard the Duck from the comics, to me, resembled a chain-smoking caricature of Donald Duck. Well, the duck here smokes, as well. He also cusses, is a master of Quack-Fu, is libidinous toward human females, and is one of cinema's most entirely unsympathetic so-called protagonists. The movie would like us to laugh and empathize with Howard, but my morals refused to. Straight from the beginning, Howard is an unlikable little twerp, and he remains an unlikable little twerp. I do grant that the special effects used to create him are fairly good. His bill opens and closes smoothly and with lip movement, his eyes do not merely sit in their sockets, and the suit movement is decent enough. But taking this vulgar character from the comics and making him into a likable figure was a tough challenge, and clearly the screenwriters were not up to it.Speaking of the screenwriters, is it a coincidence that the storytellers of this fiasco were the same duo who wrote Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom? Both films are unnecessarily grim, clumsily juggle whimsy with nightmare images, and are simply difficult to endure. Howard the Duck is very much the same, except, unlike Temple of Doom, it does not have a director who can produce some nevertheless redeeming features.

I was praising the remarkable and original humour in his writing, but my friend remained unswayed. This was old stuff, he said. He'd heard these jokes before, seen the sight gags described in the books, been exposed to the same slow build-up to the same comedic pay-off. But when I asked him where he'd come across this material, it quickly turned out that he'd encountered the style and the content in the humour of comedians working in the 1920s,1930s and 1940s,years after Mark Twain had written his last line. For him, Mark Twain was old news because his style had become the style of his inheritors.The Mummy is like this. We've seen it before. But of course we have - we've seen it in films from the 1950s and onwards. Yes, it does borrow from Browning's Dracula, made just a year before, but it also boldly carves out its own space &#x96; it's in The Mummy, not in Dracula, that we find human motives for fiendish behaviour. The Mummy does not want to turn humans into the undead &#x96; it's exactly the opposite, in fact. What's more, this film serves as the template for a slew of followers, including the trilogy of Brendan Fraser films that have as their other surrogate parent the Indiana Jones series.But influence is not the only reason to watch this film. There's also Boris Karloff. Zita Johann, the Romanian-born fan of the occult who plays the film's heroine, said when speaking of her co-star that she had never seen such sad eyes. In this role, perhaps beyond all his other work, Karloff embodies sorrow and loss. Of course, the scenes that Zita shares with Boris are, by today's standards, a little hammy. But again, remember that they were here first. It is not surprising that they adhered to acting standards of the day &#x96; what is surprising is all those little moments when they surpass them. Look in particular for Zita's acknowledgement of the dilemma she faces in deciding just who she is.There's something persistently chilling in the atmosphere of this film. It may not make you jump in the modern sense, or have you wincing, but it will get under your skin and, if you are very lucky, into your dreams.
