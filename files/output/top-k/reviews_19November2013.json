There is no music score, no action scenes, no sex appeal, but this movie is one of the best, due to two reasons great writing, and great acting. One thing that I love about this movie is how little locations there are in this film. Beside the opening scene, most of the film takes place in a room made up of 12 men jury as they deliberate the guilt or acquittal of a defendant on the basis of reasonable doubt. They must stay there, until they can be make a unanimous decision. To add to the pressure, the room goes from hot and humid to warm, and cold, making each character go through a chain full of emotions. The way, the film is filmed is amazing. It shot in a way that makes the room feel a bit claustrophobia. Since there is a lack of locations, the character of the film had to be very interesting people, and they were. Like the title says, 96 minutes of the movie is pure intense arguments between a group of men whose personalities ranges from quiet and good-hearted to outright anger and hate. None of the jury members have their real names mention, as most are refers to each other by a number given to them beforehand. When you think about it, nobody name was used in the film; the defendant is referred to as the boy and the witnesses as the old man and the lady across the street. The film use anonymity as a way to make the film more a general representation of America. These are everyday people that could very well be on your jury. This sense of anonymity raises the stakes of the play as a social drama, in that is a more general commentary of our society. Who were these men is still a mystery? We only get a glimpse of what they do in their real life. They soon become acquainted with the personalities of each other and want to vote. Some of these men believe that the young teen killed his father in a fit of rage but only one juror, Juror Number 8 (Henry Fonda) is not certain beyond a reasonable doubt that the young boy did it and felt they should talk more about it. The jury soon came head to head with clashing of arguments and questioning of the evidence. Without spoiling too much about it, I have to say the heated discussion of evidences is the best part of the film as find out more about the true personalities of the jury members. All the actors did a great job. Henry Fonda does a great job as Juror 8, as the lone man wanting to convince his peers to evaluate the matter beyond their initial, largely emotion-based judgments to determine what the kid really did do. He does this, by explaining the murder weapon and the faults of the two witnesses. Still, I doubt, even in 1950's standards, a jury member can carry a knife in a jury room. Ed Begley as Juror Number 10 is chilling as the loudmouth racist whom based on the locality where the accused lived. Lee Cobb as Juror #3 is painted as a father who allows his poor relationship with his own son to influence his judgment of the case gives one hell of a performance. Last, worth noting is Jack Warden as Number 7, a sport fan who cares more about a baseball game than the case that he is given. While the others jurors members, are interesting characters, none of them were as great as these 4 men who brings the best out of this play. Throughout the play, we see two opposing views of justice which I love. The two-sided nature of justice create tension and contrast the characters. Each character wants justice, but what justice becomes unclear and fluid throughout the course of the play. If I can find one fault in the film is how the movie makes Henry Fonda seem like the protagonist and everybody else the antagonist. We don't know if Juror 8 is right and yet, his actions are framed as an act of bravery, standing up against the group to do what's right. In the end, of the film in a chilling reverse of roles, Juror 3 is view as a stubborn man, refusing to come over to the side of reason. What's really interesting about the case within 12 Angry Men is that we never ultimately find out for sure whether the accused is guilty or innocent. It's up to question. People even today, still have open debate about if the boy did the crime or not. In modern terms, most likely the results would happen, is a mistrial assuming, of course, that applicable law permitted the content of jury deliberations to be revealed. It's one of the few movies that make you think. The film should be view by anybody going to Law, but not only that, but regular people in general. Yes, the film is a bit outdated, and younger people might not want to see a black and white film with old men yelling at each other, but I think once they mature enough, they would find this movie great as well. If not, this movie. They can watch the 1997's remake of 12 Angry Men. That version is also pretty well done. There is a lot of things that people can learn from this film, like issuing dealing with class, racism, family relationships, psychology and communications. It's really hard to hate this film. The more years pass by, the more praise it gets.

Back then I really felt that Godzilla was an effect of our meddling with atomics and a direct punishment of our ambition for power. Now, though, I only see the lame guy in the rubber suit and ridiculous acting by most involved.What was most striking for me is that it didn't really look like a Japanese film at all. Probably then the Japanese cinematography was something inspired by the American one and it took decades to transform itself into the distinctly different thing that it is now. But at least the feelings and culture expressed in the film I expected to be very Asian; they mostly weren't. One could imagine the same movie in 1954 with American actors, doing the very same scenes (obviously not in Tokyo), and not feeling out of place.There were some really dramatic moments and some real acting, but most of it was mediocre. The story was nice, though. This giant monster starts attacking people and, as was the style of the era, scientists get to save the day, not rough guys in cool machines. There is this biologist who wants to study the monster and gets upset when people want to kill it, but then again he brings no solution to how he was to study it without being killed. Another one is desperate his weapon might be used as a WMD, but he names it so descriptively that any government in the world could redo his research in a heartbeat. There is the young sweetheart, lovely thin Japanese girl, who knows all scientists involved, even if she dates the rough guy (obviously). Other than that, only the actor in the Gojira suit is mentionable, poor guy probably sweated a lot during filming.The effects were interesting for that era. Lot of model work, some of the scenes look really good, while some are ridiculous (check out the one when airplanes attack Godzilla and no matchstick rocket hits). The suit was pretty terrible as well. Surely they could have done better than that.As I was saying, the reactions of the people in the film didn't look very Japanese, all dignified and honorable. There was the transmission tower scene, where a radio operator transmits until Godzilla kills him and all he has to say is he has no time to run, he will die, sayonara, but other than that, pretty Westerner reactions, down to the control room guys dressed in suits and staying somewhere around a table looking all important.One of the big strengths of the movie is the soundtrack. It really adds weight to the story.As a conclusion, I think that for its time it was a decent film, but where I think it failed most is where it should have had the biggest impact the anti atomic and anti weapon of mass destruction line. Watching the film this second time I didn't feel any emotional reaction for or against terrible power. Indeed, terrible power is the subject of the film and also the solution to the initial problem. It really doesn't instill any desire to stop pursuing it. And of course, having 27 other movies with Godzilla, all worse than this one, doesn't help.

Other than that, only the actor in the Gojira suit is mentionable, poor guy probably sweated a lot during filming.The effects were interesting for that era. Lot of model work, some of the scenes look really good, while some are ridiculous (check out the one when airplanes attack Godzilla and no matchstick rocket hits). The suit was pretty terrible as well. Surely they could have done better than that.As I was saying, the reactions of the people in the film didn't look very Japanese, all dignified and honorable. There was the transmission tower scene, where a radio operator transmits until Godzilla kills him and all he has to say is he has no time to run, he will die, sayonara, but other than that, pretty Westerner reactions, down to the control room guys dressed in suits and staying somewhere around a table looking all important.One of the big strengths of the movie is the soundtrack. It really adds weight to the story.As a conclusion, I think that for its time it was a decent film, but where I think it failed most is where it should have had the biggest impact the anti atomic and anti weapon of mass destruction line. Watching the film this second time I didn't feel any emotional reaction for or against terrible power. Indeed, terrible power is the subject of the film and also the solution to the initial problem. It really doesn't instill any desire to stop pursuing it. And of course, having 27 other movies with Godzilla, all worse than this one, doesn't help.

It is a story about a married and successful award winning child psychologist who finds out that he failed one of his patients, he keeps thinking about this failure and tries to correct it and soon he meets another boy who suffers from the same problem as that failed patient and the doctor decides to help him to redeem himself. That is all I can say without spoiling the actual plot.In traditional terms, this is not a full fledged horror flick, there are several dramatic and emotional scenes in the movie, elements of the study of human behavior is also involved. It is more of a mix of drama and psychological horror. The horror scenes in the Sixth Sense rely on scary or dangerous looking ghosts and sound effects, now the sound effects do leave an impact but the creepy looking ghosts in films used to scare me when I was a kid, now that I am grown up this doesn't work anymore. That doesn't mean that the great sound effects won't make you feel the chills and some scenes will startle you or shock you for a few moments. Specially if you are watching the film alone in a dark room.The music in this film is brilliant, I already mentioned the sound effects but the music used for emotional scenes in the movie really helps build up the mood and suits the scenes perfectly. The acting is absolutely fantastic, Bruce Willis who is best known for action roles in films like the Die Hard Series, performs the role of Dr. Milcolm very well, it is not only shocking to see him fit so well in a role like this but act so well. Haley Joel Osment does a fantastic job, his facial expressions and delivery just feel so natural, its amazing how he could act so well at such a young age. Toni Colette and Olivia Williams have limited roles but they do good with all the screen time they get.The movie is deep and leaves you thinking, but it moves at a very slow pace and it may lose the attention of the audience at least in the first half . I also can't help but feel that this film heavily relies on its twist at the end to leave a major lasting impact on the audience rather than leaving that impact as a whole. The twist is excellent and surprising & it definitely adds a whole lot to the plot and the premise of the film as whole. The problem is that The film will only leave a full impact when you watch it for the second time, knowing what the twist at the end will be, only then you will be able to enjoy the Sixth Sense to its fullest and properly comprehend it.Overall Rating 8.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"19 November 2013","score":"","review":" The Sixth sense is a psychological horror film starring Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment in the lead.

The movie is rated as comedy among other genres. Back then I couldn't understand the funny parts of the movie. I thought it was exciting, scary and thrilling. Take that scene when Jack gets panicked, increasing his heart rate so much his heart almost devour Tuck and his pod. I chewed on my nails for sure! The casting crew is great.

But this sequel - actually a prequel - fills us in on just what went on in the brutal prison camp he was imprisoned in. Braddock and his fellow soldiers are routinely tortured and subjected to harsh, cruel, and sadistic practices, thanks to maniacal commander, Col. Yin (Oh) and his sidekick Lao (Tanaka). Will Braddock escape to see freedom? (Actually, you know he will, because this is a prequel, but just ignore that).The fans clamored for more Braddock, and more Braddock is what they got with this sequel\/prequel. Cannon provided more jungle action and Prerequisite Torture with that trademark Reagan-style patriotism that we've all come to know and love. There's even stock footage of Reagan in the actual movie. It could definitely be argued that this sequel is superior to the original, because the plot is more streamlined, and the final fight between Chuck and Soon-Tek Oh absolutely delivers the goods. The movie primarily takes place in one location - the prison camp - and you see their travails, everything from Punchfighting to dealing with Professor Toru Tanaka. He's a fan favorite and his presence improves the proceedings.Like the first film, you kind of have to wait for any substantial action, but when it comes, it's a true crowd pleaser. Adding to this, you get to see the origin of Chuck's beard. When he was first captured in 1972, he did not have a beard. But he had to grow one in captivity because Col. Yin did not provide razors. Apparently, he liked the way he looked, so he kept it. Because of Chuck's long hair and beard, and the way he's treated, in Missing In Action 2 The Beginning there are certainly some parallels to the story of Jesus. Think about it.Director Lance Hool, who was credited with writing and producing credits on the first film, here steps into the director's chair with successful results. He obviously understands the Braddock character and that's probably why he got the gig. Once again Aaron Norris is on board for stunt work, as is fan favorite John Barrett.

But this sequel - actually a prequel - fills us in on just what went on in the brutal prison camp he was imprisoned in. Braddock and his fellow soldiers are routinely tortured and subjected to harsh, cruel, and sadistic practices, thanks to maniacal commander, Col. Yin (Oh) and his sidekick Lao (Tanaka). Will Braddock escape to see freedom? (Actually, you know he will, because this is a prequel, but just ignore that).The fans clamored for more Braddock, and more Braddock is what they got with this sequel\/prequel. Cannon provided more jungle action and Prerequisite Torture with that trademark Reagan-style patriotism that we've all come to know and love. There's even stock footage of Reagan in the actual movie. It could definitely be argued that this sequel is superior to the original, because the plot is more streamlined, and the final fight between Chuck and Soon-Tek Oh absolutely delivers the goods. The movie primarily takes place in one location - the prison camp - and you see their travails, everything from Punchfighting to dealing with Professor Toru Tanaka. He's a fan favorite and his presence improves the proceedings.Like the first film, you kind of have to wait for any substantial action, but when it comes, it's a true crowd pleaser. Adding to this, you get to see the origin of Chuck's beard. When he was first captured in 1972, he did not have a beard. But he had to grow one in captivity because Col. Yin did not provide razors. Apparently, he liked the way he looked, so he kept it. Because of Chuck's long hair and beard, and the way he's treated, in Missing In Action 2 The Beginning there are certainly some parallels to the story of Jesus. Think about it.Director Lance Hool, who was credited with writing and producing credits on the first film, here steps into the director's chair with successful results. He obviously understands the Braddock character and that's probably why he got the gig. Once again Aaron Norris is on board for stunt work, as is fan favorite John Barrett.

The gold was hidden in a bank, of course, instead of buried in the sand.Although it has some great moments when it isn't trying to be funny(fail). Some fight and shootouts scenes were really great. Apocalypse Now obviously got some inspirations from this film, as the scene where the mad characters play music while destroying a village. The art design was very inconsistent. Sometimes great, sometimes poor. So were the cinematography. The filming commenced in July 1969 and was completed in December and was shot on location in the Istrian village of Vi&#x9E;inada in the former Yugoslavia and London. Yugoslavia was chosen mostly because earnings from previous showings of movies there could not be taken out of the country, but could be used to fund the production.The music in this film is one of the best aspects of this film so far. The film score was composed, arranged and conducted by Lalo Schifrin and the soundtrack album was released on the MGM label in 1970.This is an average film overall, but very worth watching. 7.3\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"19 November 2013","score":"","review":" Kelly's Heroes is not a funny film at all.
