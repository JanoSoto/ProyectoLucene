For those who enjoy a behind the scenes look at events that have occurred in real life then check it out.I really feel that things are far more evil than even this film intimates. I do hope that lawyers can be tried for war crimes against humanity. Gina Gershon played one superbly and she was supposed to be one of the good guys. Dr. Wigand put everything on the line to do the right thing. What gets me in this insane world is that the whistle blowers are given no protection at all. They are expected to do the right thing and then take it in the ear. And guys like Sammy The Bull Gravano who has admitted to killing 30 plus people in cold blood gets witness protection, plastic surgery and the right to keep his ill gotten gains. Where the hell is protection for the whistle blowers that are trying to protect us from greedy, amoral and thorughly ruthless b****rds that run corporate America and multi-national corporations. Logic would dictate that we help out the whistle blowers. Luckily for Dr. Wigand things worked out sort of. Unhappily for us the tobacco industry seems to be stronger than ever. This film is really important for the outstanding commanding powerful performance of Al Pacino. If for no other reason Al Pacino's character in this movie stands for a person who is as good as his word. He in short has integrity in a world that has lost even the knowledge of what that word ever meant.

It's the best directed, best acted, most engaging, most action-packed, scariest, and most moving of the three movies making up the Alien Trilogy. All three movies are classics in their own right, but this one is certainly the best. Alien Resurrection, although entertaining, is nothing more than a cheesy, unscary, effects-laden, badly scripted and badly acted slasher movie compared to this masterpiece.Director James Cameron does all that could be asked of him in a sequel to one of the best movies ever made...and more. It was difficult to top Ridley Scott's original, but he does it! Again filled with awesome special F\/X, fine acting, and a compelling screenplay, Aliens plays the trump card needed to make any sequel, by developing themes from the original. With a plentiful crop of terrifying action scenes, music, acting, characters, and the spectacular ending, this is arguably better than the original, and far superior to the other two sequels.Despite an overlong beginning which gets rather boring at times, the movie is still terrific. Ripley has matured a great deal from the first movie and her character is fully developed. The cinematography and eerie sets are amazing. The effective sense of just how intelligent the aliens truly are and the utter sense of helplessness and determination of the marines combined with the great ending that leads directly into Alien 3 all combine efforts to make a masterpiece of a movie. The sheer horror we feel when Newt is captured by the aliens is unbearable to say the least, and Ripley's determination to do everything she can to save her makes it even more realistic.The characters are so startlingly realistic that one not only believes every moment, one lives vicariously through these people throughout the movie. I mean, how you forget memorable characters like Hicks, Hudson, Vasquez, and even minor ones like Dietrich and Wierzbowski. The special effects are also amazing, so real you wouldn't even know it's fake. There are highly realistic and detailed aliens, believable weaponry, unrivaled action sequences, and explosions that make other action movies like True Lies and Starship Troopers look like a commercial for Doublemint Gum. The dialogue is funny, well-written, moving, and believable. And, of course, this is definitely among the most entertaining and fun movies I have ever see.Unfortunately, even a classic like Aliens has its share of flaws. Why didn't any of the marines stay on the Sulaco during the mission? How come Ripley wasted all her ammo on the eggs rather than on the Queen? Still, despite its flaws, Aliens is indeed one heck of a film.This movie rates even above its classic predecessor as one of the greatest science-fiction films of all time.

Perhaps the most interesting film I have seen this past year, it certainly tops my list as the best film of 1999. It is perhaps in my top 5 of the decade. Brilliant direction by stage director-turned film director Sam Mendes brings to life an intelligent script that is free of the contrivances that so many other films have offered as an excuse for intricately woven material. Ever since Pulp Fiction ushered in a new wave of independent films (they're cheaper by the dozen it seems) we have seen one too many dozen bad excuses for an indie film; sometimes it seems they become more conventional than your typical Hollywood cop-buddy film you know, a bunch of colorful characters who get together to pull off a crime, they wear dark clothes, they swear more than they actually converse, and then about 99.9 % of them die by film's end. Even Tarantino himself has secluded himself from the film world it seems, only occassionally taking part in a film production- maybe the impact Pulp Fiction had was a little imposing for him.And here we have Mendes' American Beauty, one of the freshest takes on the lives of everyday Americans I have seen. Kevin Spacey leads a very fine cast in this tale of an emotionally (and morally) bankrupt man whose family detests him. Spacey, through the crush of a girl less than half his age, manages to find new ways to redeem himself he smokes marijuana and starts working out to lose that flab (sometimes both at the same time!). He even gets a very decent settlement from his employers, which leads to his buying a 1970 Pontiac Firebird... and a new job at a fast food joint he's been dying to work at.

I thought the well publicized rape scene was unnecessarily graphic and way too long. We didn't need to see it (late in the film as a flashback) to appreciate the pain she went through.This movie, like so many others, moved progressively toward a jury verdict. As the climax of the film, it certainly hurts how I rate the movie when, in my opinion, the verdict was preposterous. Of course we knew what the verdict would be, but I hoped that somehow it would be different - though difficult to reconcile.SPOILER WARNING The trial was not about the rapists, but rather about the ones who watched and participated via encouragement - a felony. The jury found all three accused encouragers guilty. Though, we as an audience, certainly know they were guilty and we hope they get their just due, it just doesn't begin to hold up that a real jury would have found them guilty in a court of law.1) There were at least 20 people watching at all different levels of encouragement. Where do you draw the line. And, that presupposes that you can state with absolute certainty what person went to what degree along that line. How could these three have been separated from the others for a felony is beyond me.2) In order to be convicted of encouraging a rape, you have to first prove in a court of law that there WAS a rape. That was never done. In fact, the only court documentation was that the three rapists had been convicted of an assault charge. The whole point of that plea bargain was that it specifically omitted any implication of a sexual crime. So, there is no way the bystanders could be convicted of encouraging a rape, when it had not been legally established.3) Most importantly. There is no possible way that it could be definitively proven that these three bystandards KNEW that she was being raped. There certainly was enough subjectivity in the scene (thus the court testimony) that would make it impossible to KNOW that each of these men knew that she was being raped. If they did not know there was a felony being committed, then there was nothing illegal about their cheering! If they thought that she was just having a good time with these three guys, then they may be pigs for watching and cheering, but hardly criminals.Summary There is no way in the world that they would have been found guilty as the movie portrayed it. No way! A jury of twelve people unanimously stating that beyond any reasonable doubt, they were guilty. No way. Unfortunately, this is not just like some minor issue I have with part of the plot. This is THE VERDICT - the climax - the whole point of the movie. Considering, I would have given it a 9 had the verdict been not guilty, I really am being easy on it by giving it an 8. And, considering the average imdb voter gave it a 7.3, I am being really generous.

Of course we knew what the verdict would be, but I hoped that somehow it would be different - though difficult to reconcile.SPOILER WARNING The trial was not about the rapists, but rather about the ones who watched and participated via encouragement - a felony. The jury found all three accused encouragers guilty. Though, we as an audience, certainly know they were guilty and we hope they get their just due, it just doesn't begin to hold up that a real jury would have found them guilty in a court of law.1) There were at least 20 people watching at all different levels of encouragement. Where do you draw the line. And, that presupposes that you can state with absolute certainty what person went to what degree along that line. How could these three have been separated from the others for a felony is beyond me.2) In order to be convicted of encouraging a rape, you have to first prove in a court of law that there WAS a rape. That was never done. In fact, the only court documentation was that the three rapists had been convicted of an assault charge. The whole point of that plea bargain was that it specifically omitted any implication of a sexual crime. So, there is no way the bystanders could be convicted of encouraging a rape, when it had not been legally established.3) Most importantly. There is no possible way that it could be definitively proven that these three bystandards KNEW that she was being raped. There certainly was enough subjectivity in the scene (thus the court testimony) that would make it impossible to KNOW that each of these men knew that she was being raped. If they did not know there was a felony being committed, then there was nothing illegal about their cheering! If they thought that she was just having a good time with these three guys, then they may be pigs for watching and cheering, but hardly criminals.Summary There is no way in the world that they would have been found guilty as the movie portrayed it. No way! A jury of twelve people unanimously stating that beyond any reasonable doubt, they were guilty. No way. Unfortunately, this is not just like some minor issue I have with part of the plot. This is THE VERDICT - the climax - the whole point of the movie. Considering, I would have given it a 9 had the verdict been not guilty, I really am being easy on it by giving it an 8.

Of the acting, it is true what everyone else has been saying that both Jodie Foster and Chow Yun-Fat acted extremely well. I've always been a Chow Yun-Fat fan. He's certainly a versatile actor, this I know from his Asian movies, but this is his break-out performance in America. Basically, if you really like great acting, then you'll love this movie. Anna and the King is also a very heart-warming movie mixed with enough excitement to please most people.This isn't entirely a romance movie either. A history lesson is trying to be told here. Although as documentaries go...well Anna and the King is not 100% correct. However history seems so much more drier if it was told by facts alone. No one would go pay money to see documentaries in movie theaters, but they will go to see a movie especially if it's a good movie. Anna and the King is a good movie. Some people have griped about the theme song, the one scene with explosion, and whether or not the title of the movie appeared in the credits.

Personally, I don't mind this as it allows me to let myself go and be sympathetic for the characters as if they had meaning for two hours and nine minutes in my life.

Nixon walks the tightrope between a by-the-books historical docudrama and a director's own opinion of a President who ended the war in Southeast Asia, who made peace with both China and the Soviet Union, and who was somehow brought down by a third-rate burglary (not to mention illegally bombing Cambodia, lying to the American public, defying popular opinion to end the war, taping every conversation in the White House, hating the Kennedys, etc.). What makes this film better than most of the attempts to document a major American public figure on the big screen is the incredible performances by the entire cast. Anthony Hopkins, who just four years earlier was Hannibal Lector, completely transformed himself into Nixon. It was his performance of a lifetime and it should have won him the Academy Award. The supporting cast is great, especially Paul Sorvino as Henry Kissinger, James Woods as H.R. Haldeman, J.T. Walsh as John Ehrlichman, David Hyde-Pierce as John Dean, and Powers Boothe as Alexander Haig. Even minor roles by George Plimpton, Larry Hagman, Bob Hoskins and others are excellent. This movie allows Americans who grew up in the post-Nixon era to understand what Watergate was all about. More compelling than All The President's Men, it really is the story of the man and not his presidency. Stone plays up Nixon's insecurities but what the audience should walk away with is a portrait of a man who's own worst enemy was himself. Numerous comments by the supporting cast throughout the film, particularly those by Kissinger and Ehrlichman, back up this idea. In no way is Stone trying to defend Nixon but his film is actually sympathetic towards the man. Whether you liked Nixon or not, under all of the layers, his heart was in the right place. Unfortunately, he chose to betray the confidence that the American people had entrusted in him and that is why he will never, even posthumously, escape the humiliation of taking the fall for three decades of mistakes that seriously damaged the international reputation of the United States. I give this film the highest recommendation, not only as a convenient way to begin to understand thirty years of social upheaval, but as a movie that stands on its own as a celebration of American culture. Love him or hate him, Nixon defined an era in American history in which the United States was forced to re-examine itself before it could re-examine the rest of the world.
