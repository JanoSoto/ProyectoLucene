Since I was a boy, this movie accompanies my life.. There was a time when I was three or four years old, I watched it like twice a week, I almost remember every line from the characters, every shots, every scene. Since I was a kid, I thought that this is the best film ever.. I love this movie so much especially because everything in it is very very cool, Luke's green lightsaber, the final duel between Luke and Darth Vader, and mostly because my favorite fictional character, Darth Vader's heroic death.. Now that I'm older, I can seemore great aspects of this film besides its coolness. Han Solo's(Harrison Ford) and Darth Sidious's (Ian McDiarmid) acting was trulyterrific.. Harrison Ford truly lighten up this movie by some degree of comedy, since Luke's character has transformed to become more mature, patience, and serious. Ian McDiarmid as The Emperor also did a terrific job, he is portraying Darth Sidious as the most twisted dark villain in my life, as we can see there isn't anything good left behind The Emperor, it is just pure SITH, pure dark side, evil and twisted. The mirror lightsaber battle, DjemSo v.s. DjemSo by Vader and Luke is the most magnificent and greatly choreographed duel at that time, and the development of Darth Vader's character from the dark side back to light is done magnificently, in my opinion much better than his transformation from Annakin to Darth Vader in The Revenge of The Sith. Darth Vader also shows a great moral value, that however bad your sin or mistake was, there always a chance of redemption. Finally in this movie, the greatest villain of all time got the redemption he deserves.However, I must admit this is not the perfect flawless 10\/10 movie like Schindler's List or Lord of The Rings Return of The King. There are some flaws in this movie. One fatal flaws that all of us- Star Wars fan regret is how could Gorge Lucas end his double trilogy with a war between 1meter-tall monkey and Imperial Stormtroopers? How could the primitive Ewoks beat all of the modern Elite Trained Strormtroopersw, therefore doomed all of the Empire, a feat that a fully assembled Rebel Army never could have done.. Aside from those idiots Ewoks, this is a very great films.. Definitely better than Star Wars I or II.. Although maybe from performing arts points of view this film is the worst of all Star Wars Original Trilogy, it is still the film that I watched many many times, the film that grow up with me, and teach me how great it is the world of cinematography and performing arts.

From the minute the soldiers started to lad things went wrong when one soldier falls from a helicopter. Complicating matters even more is the fact that the Somali's know how to take out the helicopters and soon one of the Blackhawks goes down. This is followed by a second helicopter.

Certainly as a representation of urban guerrilla war this is a kick in the pants. You are there in the thick of chaos as choppers go down and everyman is fighting desperately for cover.

Anybody who's read the Batman comics or seen the animated series knows that the Governator is not suitable for the part of Mr. Freeze. However, it really doesn't matter who would have played the part because the character's lines are written so terribly that it makes him seem like a total idiot rather than an intelligent scientist like he's supposed to be. Throughout the entire movie, he delivers enough cheesy puns to make you want to rip your hair out (The ice man cometh!, and Let's kick some ice! to name only a few). That alone makes the movie very hard to sit through without breaking the television set.The other elements of the movie aren't nearly as aggravating, but at the same time, they not very well done either. This movie reminds me a lot of the Fantastic Four movies, as well as many other lousy action movies of the past 10-15 years. It offers an endless amount of extremely far-fetched action sequences with paper-thin characters.The biggest problem with Batman & Robin is the screenplay and the storyline, which both seem like they were written by a five-year-old, and director Joel Schumacher is also to blame for allowing such terrible writing. The actors try their best to do well at their parts, but they're offered such awful dialog that doesn't mentally or emotionally lead them anywhere throughout the movie, and Joel Schumacher probably wasn't much of a help either, so I'm sure it was difficult for them to learn how to work their roles. George Clooney's Bruce Wayne\/Batman goes through none of the emotional turmoil that Michael Keaton's, Val Kilmer's, and Christian Bale's do in the other Batman movies. Instead, he's always talking down to Robin, and Robin just keeps whining like a spoiled brat and complaining about the same things over and over (I want a car!, I want my own robin signal in the sky!, I'm tired of always following you around, Batman!).Another problem with this movie is that there are way too many characters, and there's not enough involvement or depth to any of the characters for us to really care about them. Alicia Silverstone is only in the film for about five minutes. I like Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy because she actually fits her part, unlike Arnold does for his, but all she pretty much does in the whole movie is blow perfume at all the men to make them fall in love with her. Bane is the biggest example of a character who is paper-thin and underused in the film. I've never read the Batman comics, and I don't remember Bane in the cartoon, but I'm pretty sure that the Bane character is meant to be more than how he's displayed in the movie as a giant Hulk Hogan figure who talks like a caveman.The bottom line is that Batman & Robin is very poorly done compared to all the other Batman films. The only positive comment I can make about it is that Alfred is involved in the story more than he usually is. I just watched this movie again for the first time in eleven years last night, and as you can see, I didn't like it too much. However, I remember enjoying it more when I was nine years old and I saw it in the theater. So if you're a child, then you might like this movie. You also might like it if you enjoy other sloppy action movies like Alien vs. Predator. Otherwise, unless you want to see how cheesy and irritatingly poor a Batman film can possibly be (this is even more cheesy than the T.V. show was), don't bother to add Batman & Robin to your Batman movie collection.

On the other hand it's a film that tries way too hard. It's an action, adventure, Sci-Fi, Comedy, Drama, Romance, and Disaster movie all mixed into one! Then throw in a gigantic budget, an all-star cast, dazzling special effects, explosions, a cheesy love story, over the top humor, and lots of music. Add that all together and we have the most overwhelming movie ever made. The viewer is just bombarded with this barrage of special effects, music, cheap jokes, and romance, I felt my brain was overloading. If your looking for pure Fun & entertainment then you'll probably love this film. Of course you have to be prepared to suspend disbelief in order to enjoy this movie and ignore the obvious flaws. 1.) First off there is an asteroid the size of Texas hurtling towards Earth. In reality the largest asteroid ever discovered was about the size of a small city, there isn't an asteroid of such freakish size anywhere near our solar system.2.) NASA only becomes aware of the asteroid after a meteor shower and when they do discover it they only have 18 days before it hits Earth. In reality we would have a few years warning that an asteroid of such size was coming that close to us. NASA telescopes are very powerful and can see beyond our solar system, so they would have to be blind to miss it. We'd have plenty of warning.3.) being that we'd have plenty of warning we'd also have plenty of time to prepare. So the whole story of Armageddon is now out of the question. NASA would train a rag tag group of undisciplined oil drillers to go into space in a few days on this mission to drill a hole into the asteroid and blow it up with a nuke cause the astronauts know nothing about drilling. In reality they would most likely have the drillers train their astronauts in drilling for months maybe even a year for this kinda mission. The oil drillers would never have been prepared for the rigors of space travel in such a short period of time.4.) Asteroids are usually more rounded, not funky looking like the asteroid in this film. The Comet in Deep Impact was more accurate to the shape and look of asteroids & comets.5.) NASA doesn't have cool advanced looking shuttles that fly like fighter aircraft like the ones in this movie. It would take months for them to make such a ship. And they wouldn't be that stupid in installing gatling guns on the armadillos in the event Steve Buschemi goes nuts.6.) In the movie the team Drill a hole 800 feet deep to plant a nuclear warhead in the center which would split the asteroid in two and divert them in opposite directions, both of which would miss the planet. In reality if the asteroid was that big they would need to drill the hole about a hundred miles into the damn thing, and it would take more than one Nuke to do the job. The asteroid would also not split in half and miss the planet, It would most likely fragment into a few pieces and probably still hit. At 800 feet it would probably just make a big crater.... at best!7.) The team swing shots around the moon at 11 G's in order to get behind the asteroid. In reality at 11 G's they would either pass out or die. 8.) Asteroids don't have gravitational fields. 9.) biblical inaccuracies in the bible Armageddon is described as the epic battle on Earth between the forces of good & evil. So is the asteroid embodying evil or something, it's just a freaking rock.Is it just me or is there is always something going wrong in this film. Atlantis destroyed, Meteor showers, cities destroyed, team members clash & bicker, The Russian space station explodes, they land on the hardest part of the rock, the military panics and tries to blow the nuke up from Earth, then the Nuke won't explode so someone has to stay behind to blow it up. Nobody likes constant drama in their lives why would we want it in this movie. It also tries too many times to be funny at the most unexpected and unnatural times.How can Liv Tyler's character fall for Ben Affleck's character? Affleck plays someone who's so annoying, so whinny, and immature. No wonder Bruce Willis doesn't want them getting married. That scene where Affleck & Tyler are having a picnic and he plays animal cracker safari on her belly was the most retarded thing I ever saw, in fact it was kinda weird. In fact many of the characters were over the top & dramatic.For all it's fun Armageddon simply lacks any intelligence. It's all brawn and no brain. Like I said if you looking for just entertainment you'll enjoy this film, if you like your films to be somewhat intelligent then you might want to save your money.

I watched it with my mom and dad in my home. At that time, the only thing I can remember from the film is only a laser gun, mean black robot with red laser sword, spaceships, and Luke Skywalker. From the first time I watched it, this film totally amazes me, truly capture all of my imagination, and inspiring even for children of my age. Since then, I remember I watched this film almost everyday.. especially during my lunch and dinner.. (I love to watch movie while eating).Of course I skipped all of the dialog part that I don't understand and only watch the Death Star shooting scene, the ObiWan vs DarthVader, and the final spaceships battle. I grew up with this saga, fill my entire room with StarWars action figure, bought all of those stupid Star Wars coloring books.Now that I am older, I still believe that this is one of the best movie which ever made. George Lucas really captures all aspects of storytelling to this film, there are action, drama, suspense, adventure, comedy, thriller, anything (except horror of course) in this movie. It is the most compact movie of all time, consisting of every factors possible to be in a movie.Mark Hamill has done such a wonderful job playing his characters, Luke Skywalker.. It is a character that set the standard and become a role model for what should main protagonist in adventure film should be. As Luke Skywalker, Hamill successfully portrays his teenage farm boy image, with the sense of humor and jokes that really feels that Luke is the REAL person who lived in the galaxy far-far away from this earth.However, the brightest star or the show is Han Solo.. Mr.Ford plays this character brilliantly, he made Solo such a charming character and capture the totally audience's heart. He makes Solo a REAL space pirates with the way that he escape from trouble, his lack of respect towards fair head to head fighting, jokes in the most critical times, and his witty comment throughout the laser gun fight with the stormtroopers.Princess Leia also made a terrific impact to the series, it is one of the very first KICK ASS and in-your-face princess character ever. It is totally capable of defending herself and not the typical stupid princess who got into trouble and start screaming HELP MEE.. without really doing anything. C-3PO also plays a very important role, as the source of comedy and tension-breaker throughout this film with all of his non important but funny comments. It is even funnier to watch other characters reaction toward his comments.Last but not least, the greatest character created by Lucas, and the baddest, greatest, most iconic villain of the 20th century, Darth Vader played brilliantly by David Prowse and James Earl Jones. Darth Vader is really the greatest antagonist of all time. He got scary mask, black armor, blood crimson colored laser swords, a brilliant strategist, what else can you asked for? The greatest thing that differs Vader from the typical villain is that Vader is literally an unstoppable force, without any mercy at all, he crushes all of his enemies and even allies who got in his way, he shows no hesitation in pulling the trigger. He doesn't have the stupid villain arrogance that usually ends up by killing the villain himself in the end. Vader demonstrate his seriousness in striking down the unguarded Obi Wan and in demolishing almost every Rebel Starships remaining on the Battle of Yavin.With all those great and groundbreaking characters, George Lucas acts as the final catalyst to create such great classic. He ingeniously mix all those complex characters and adds almost every elements of storytelling to this masterpiece. The story moves up pretty well in a brilliant up and downs, as he divide the scene to a perfect proportion of funny scenes, emotional scenes, action scenes, he is really showing us all the meaning of BALANCE..

I disagree - its a very subtle character drama about human nature first, and a stripping down of the Hollywood star system second. I like All About Eve as much as the next film buff, but The Barefoot Contessa takes a completely different approach to what may appear as similar material initially. The film may be a soap opera, but its an absolutely gorgeous one. The acting is terrific, the venomous dialog is among the best I've heard, the characters are sympathetic, and its beautifully filmed.There's many reasons why the film is such a success. The direction and screenplay by Joseph L. Mankiewicz are among his best work. His direction is stunning - the film is slowly paced and extremely low-key. It's low-key nature may be why its been largely overlooked today (the current rating on IMDb of 6.9 is completely undeserving). The screenplay has some of the best dialog I've yet to hear. The characters often seem to come and go, which is one of the few flaws the film has. However, the two main characters of Harry Dawes and Maria Vargas are compelling throughout.Another reason for the film's success is the acting. Humphrey Bogart offers a refreshingly quiet turn as the has-been director Harry Dawes. If it isn't one of his absolute best performances, its certainly shows the range as an actor he had. Ava Gardner is gorgeous and does a great job as the uncompromising woman the Hollywood system tries to victimize. Edmond O'Brien offers one of his best performances as the man who tries to be the voice of reason (but fails) throughout.

I still regret seeing it to this day.The story is standard that makes no ****ing sense. Three astronauts go to Mars, with only one actually landing on the surface (Massive logic flaw there. Even NASA wouldn't put someone at that big of risk). Anyway, on his trip, Patrick Ross leaves an American flag and picks up three rock samples (16 months in space for three hunks of stone. That sounds more like NASA). But when he reboards the main ship and the crew get ready to head back to Earth, unbeknowst to them, one of the rock samples spews out a sentient puddle of dark green goo, that assimilates with the astronauts without them knowing. Upon their return to Earth, Patrick celebrates the best way he knows after being told they were in sexual quarantine and making an appearance at some big ball for the crew, he gets a couple socialites in a hotel room and nails them both. Both women get to see his back sprout tentacles before they both go through nine months of pregnancy and the little half alien brood bursts out of their bodies. Patrick quickly stashes the kids in a childhood barn. While all this has been happening, we find out that Laura (from the previous movie) now runs a program designed to find weaknesses in the aliens, using a clone of the first alien, named Eve, as her test subject. Eve is supposed to be more docile and has her more alien traits dormat, but that doesn't stop her from getting incredibly excited when Patrick's brood are born (due to a psychic ability the aliens have). The government realizes they have another alien sex machine and calls in bad ass alien exterminator Press Lennox. They check the other two astronauts as the sexual quarantine lifts and Patrick, having spawned other alien seeds, retreats for a romantic weekend with his fiancé. Press and Laura find astronaut one, the woman in the crew, already impregnated but they are able to contain the situation (Although the woman astronaut dies without any explanation). They track the other astronaut (who is the definition of bad stereotypes about black people) down but discover he was immune to the alien goo because he is a carrier of sickle cell anemia. Patrick awakes next to his gutted fiancé and another alien child and decides he must stop it. He puts on his air force uniform and takes his hunting rifle out on the deck. Just as the black astronaut arrives, Patrick blows his entire head off. And it grows back. He now sets out to spread his seed even more. The team decides to use Eve's psychic ability to track him. They find him just after he realizes Eve and take him in to custody. He finally reveals his true colors when they arrive at the facility Eve is at. After escaping, he goes to his spawn and puts them in cocoons. As the team, now joined by the black astronaut, gets ready to track Patrick, Eve breaks out and goes to him. They follow and use some kind of spray to kill the alien brood. Eve and Patrick start going at it as aliens (yes, it is disturbing) but the team manages to turn Eve back against Patrick. He proceeds to kill her by forcing a phallic looking tentacle down her throat. They finally kill Patty boy with a pitch fork covered in black astronaut's sickle cell filled blood. Eve's dead body is carted out as they clean up the barn, only to be shown something may have survived....There isn't much redeeming about this movie. There is a LARGE amount of nudity and sex but it is always followed by an exploding uterus, something that only needed to be shown once but is showcased again and again. There are plot and logic holes you could drive a truck through scattered throughout, which combined with terrible writing and an uninterested cast, makes the whole thing tedious.

It is a very complicated, thought-out screenplay. Us having to wonder throughout the whole film why the character of Leonard kills a certain man, 'John G' gives us a reason to watch the film. This film is just like a puzzle. It gives you bits and bits, and it gives you real life memories that Leonard cannot himself remember. It starts off, and it had me worried, since these types of films can only do so much to solve the puzzles. The writing is consistently strong, as the film goes along, we are able to finally see how Leonard meets all these characters, and how he interacts with them. Well, the film is not only helped by its puzzling screenplay, but also by stand-out performances. Guy Pearce, this is the second film in which I have seen he stars in, and I know enough to say that he is a very underrated actor. His character has to carry the whole film, and his performance is consistently strong. His plays his character with grace, with confusion, and with emotion and force to do what he is willing to do to get revenge. The supporting performances are also all stand-out. Carrie-Ann Moss plays her mixed character amazingly. In one scene particularly, when she and Leonard have their only 'fight', well, her acting I thought was Oscar-worthy. It was also nice to see Joe Pantoliano be in this film. I have seen some of his work in The Sopranos, and in this film he really gives his character or Teddy a realistic touch, he gives him personality. I also thought some brief performances, like Stephen Tobolowsky, another TV star, I thought he did very well. Another great thing was the film editing. i can truly say it is amazing, and it makes the film feel fast-paced, yet complicated and never boring. The musical score was also settling, and was a very nice tone to the whole film.Now, this is a sort of a film you have to figure out, and about the ending, I am still a bit confused, and I can tell before I visit more fan topics about this film, that some people will absolutely HATE the ending. I don't hate it, but i think it works in both positive and negative ways. The negative is that it was not the final 'revelation' that films like these usually have. It wasn't really similar to The Prestige, with a big twist, and I thought needed to have one. BUT at the same time, it was a huge twist. The ending I do appreciate, because Nolan was not just trying to just tell a 'amnesia' thriller type film he was trying to say something more, and he succeeded. Now I can view as the main character, Leonard, as being both sort of crazy and alive. I think what the ending meant was that Leonard really needed a reason to live, because of his wife's death. That is why he will continue to create puzzles for himself. In a way, I appreciate film-making like this, but I do have my usual complaints.Overall, this is a film not to be missed. I had never heard of it, and I think after seeing a couple of Nolan films, it proves he is at the top of being the most original, complexing, 'alive' director(Note- i have yet to see The Dark Knight) I will try to purchase this film, I think it deserves a repeat viewing, especially since the ending didn't reveal 'too' much...

I even bought the Jerry Goldsmith score on LP (which I still have, although it's well scratched up now...wish it was on CD!). Sadly, the film hardly ever aired on TV. Finally, it came out on DVD and I bought it right away and watch it regularly. It is, as many have commented, the rare perfect film. There are no wasted or superfluous shots. Every performance, even the smallest ones, are heartfelt and nuanced. The two leads, as many have mentioned, are outstanding, but the actors\/actresses who played the other nuns, and also Juan, Mr. Ashton, and the priest (who, if you look closely, you will see he eventually went on to costar in Kojak with Telly Savalas), are all GREAT! I will disagree with those who say the movie is not about race relations. It is, but as it does with the issue of faith, the writing and direction is so subtle that you don't even realize it. In fact, the film grapples with many issues, but underlying them all is the tolerance for those who are unlike ourselves. All the characters come to see other people for who they are, not their preconceived notions. Ashton comes to respect Homer as a hard working man, not as a colored boy. Homer realizes the nuns have sacrificed much for their faith and he admires that. And, most pointedly, the Mother Superior finally realizes that even though Homer Smith is not a man of faith he still did (what to her was) God's work albeit without the window dressing of the Catholic faith. And I could go on and on.The score for this film is one of Goldsmith's best, highlighted by poignant refrains such as when the nuns are walking down the dusty road all alone after Homer leaves them. The sweet soft music played when Homer inscribes his name on the steeple cement is another nice moment.The way comedy is interwoven into the drama is another hallmark of the film's genius. None of the humor is cheap or insensitive but is based on people being simply human whether it's the scene where Mother Superios splashes cold water on a still sleeping Homer, the confusion that arises when all the villagers try to take over the chapel construction without Homer helping, the banter between Homer and Mother Superior, or Ashton's exasperation at the end when he tells Smith that the Mother Superior now wants his help with a school and hospital.Sadly, many younger people raised on ADD-influenced\/VH1-inspired non-stop action films will probably not embrace a low-key thoughtful and sincere drama (in Black and White) like this, but I understand why they don't see what there is to like about this.

I even bought the Jerry Goldsmith score on LP (which I still have, although it's well scratched up now...wish it was on CD!). Sadly, the film hardly ever aired on TV. Finally, it came out on DVD and I bought it right away and watch it regularly. It is, as many have commented, the rare perfect film. There are no wasted or superfluous shots. Every performance, even the smallest ones, are heartfelt and nuanced. The two leads, as many have mentioned, are outstanding, but the actors\/actresses who played the other nuns, and also Juan, Mr. Ashton, and the priest (who, if you look closely, you will see he eventually went on to costar in Kojak with Telly Savalas), are all GREAT! I will disagree with those who say the movie is not about race relations. It is, but as it does with the issue of faith, the writing and direction is so subtle that you don't even realize it. In fact, the film grapples with many issues, but underlying them all is the tolerance for those who are unlike ourselves. All the characters come to see other people for who they are, not their preconceived notions. Ashton comes to respect Homer as a hard working man, not as a colored boy. Homer realizes the nuns have sacrificed much for their faith and he admires that. And, most pointedly, the Mother Superior finally realizes that even though Homer Smith is not a man of faith he still did (what to her was) God's work albeit without the window dressing of the Catholic faith. And I could go on and on.The score for this film is one of Goldsmith's best, highlighted by poignant refrains such as when the nuns are walking down the dusty road all alone after Homer leaves them. The sweet soft music played when Homer inscribes his name on the steeple cement is another nice moment.The way comedy is interwoven into the drama is another hallmark of the film's genius. None of the humor is cheap or insensitive but is based on people being simply human whether it's the scene where Mother Superios splashes cold water on a still sleeping Homer, the confusion that arises when all the villagers try to take over the chapel construction without Homer helping, the banter between Homer and Mother Superior, or Ashton's exasperation at the end when he tells Smith that the Mother Superior now wants his help with a school and hospital.Sadly, many younger people raised on ADD-influenced\/VH1-inspired non-stop action films will probably not embrace a low-key thoughtful and sincere drama (in Black and White) like this, but I understand why they don't see what there is to like about this. However, despite it being more than 40 years old, Lilies of the Field has stood the test of time and is every bit as relevant, charming and insightful now as it was when it premiered.

The only thing I like about this movie (as I am a collector and admirer of the BATMAN comic-books) are the melancholic and darker undertones in the scenes with Nicole Kidman and Val Kilmer.Val Kilmer is in my opinion the second-best Bruce Wayne\/Batman after Christian Bale. His and Nicole Kidman's performances make the movie worth watching.What nearly made me cry, were the totally silly performances of Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey as Two-Face and the Riddler. I think their (or the director's) approach is an offense to everyone who seriously reads the comic books (and as I have nearly everything that was released in Germany in the last 30 years, I count myself in)!!! I will go as far to say, that Jim Carrey played the Riddler as a totally stupid and laughable character which could also be felt in the following years of appearances of the Riddler in the comic-books. Because of this film no one could take the riddler serious any more.So, if you are a kid, who likes to watch the animated series and collect the related comic-books - this is a movie for you. But if you are into the realistic Batman-Comics (DC\/BATMAN\/LOTDK\/SOTB...) you will despise great parts of this movie and only like a few scenes!
