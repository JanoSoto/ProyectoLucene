The cast is made up of favorites Gary Sinise, Jerry O'Connell, Connie Nielsen, Don Cheadle, an uncredited Armin Mueller-Stahl, and Tim Robbins. I guess I should realize that when a well known actor is last on the credits list, he's gonna die in the film. After Robbins made his exit, the film became very boring and tedious, and downright silly. The CGI Martian woman was beyond ridiculous. I thought Hollywood was capable of more realistic imaging than that!!! In these days of realistic dinosaurs and explosions courtesy of CGI, the Martian lady was a horrible cartoon!!! I don't even like to watch the film after Robbins is gone. I just watch it up to that point and then turn it off. As for the first half, I LOVED IT!!! The music was not annoying at all, it sounded like an old Disney movie's music would have, and it goes great in this movie!!! I enjoyed the scene where the micrometeors penetrated the ship. This IS a Disney movie, I remember, so I was surprised they endorsed Dr. Pepper instead of Coca Cola!!! LOLI thought Sinise looked kinda cute with eyeliner and spiky hair and muscle shirts, by the way!!! So did Robbins!!! And no matter what he does, O'Connell never annoys me.Film could have been a ton more fun.

Although this film did go down-hill after the 'Clark Kent vs. Superman' scene in the junkyard, I thought this film had a good storyline to it. Not only the acting was good (especially by Christopher Reeve) for when he turned from 'good to evil' but I found this film humorous and exciting in every way as Richard Pryor contributed mostly towards the humour side. Although I liked this movie there were some aspects in it that didn't make sense, like why did Dennis Hopper and his crew tried to kill Superman after he turned evil as he wasn't a problem to them at that point. Also how they use the same actors in different roles thinking that the viewers wouldn't realise it.(ie. The weedy Policeman from Houston in Superman 2,was the same actor in Superman 3, who had cash spitting out at him at the cash-point machine in New York) but then again this has happened a few times in all the Superman films.Something else I figured out in this film that not all viewers may have noticed is that Lona's son Ricky mat have saved Supermans life. This is because after the scene when Superman left the pub drunk and little Ricky was shouting out to him saying how how he believed in him and how he'd be great again - as those words stuck in his mind when he was flying away, I think that somewhat softened the evil Superman which then forced Clark Kent - his remaining goodness within him to exit his body in the junkyard and thereafter battling one another. So if Ricky wasn't there to encourage the Superman, then Superman would have probably perished.As a film thats different from the other Superman films (ie. without Lois Lane, Perry whites Office and Lex Luthor) I thought this film carried itself quite well. The reason why this film may have had bad ratings is because the viewers are too narrow minded to accept a sequel thats different from what they're used to. Apart from this the scene in the junkyard with Superman vs. Clark Kent was probably one of the most spectacular scenes in the whole Superman trilogy which also says a lot for how good this film was.

This is a pretty good time waster that contains several scenes of mild to moderate suspense. It involves four friends going down the wrong alley in order to take a short cut to a boxing match only to witness a murder, and run from the thugs responsible. The film's main protagonists each have their own unique qualities, but unfortunately, none of them are fleshed out enough for us to really care about them. Emilio plays the guy beginning to mature with married life, Stephen Dorff plays his younger, hot headed brother who talks more trash than he delivers, Cuba Gooding plays Emilio's best friend who apparently has insecurity issues when it comes to people messing with him and people not covering his back (this poor characterization is culminized as you watch Cuba's horrible overacting) and of course, the great, loquacious and always facetious Jeremy Piven plays the role of the sleazeball con-man perfect to a 'T'. Unfortunately, of these characters, you really feel for none of them as they are not fleshed out beyond their stereotypes.The real standout, of course, is Denis Leary...he is truly one convincing bad guy in this film...a force of pure determined hatred, that will stop at nothing to kill the guys. Of everyone, Leary is the only one who does not overact, he is completely natural in this role, and though he is given little to do with the script but spout out cheesy, yet oddly effective taunts at the four, he is a menacing presence nonetheless.The echoes this film has with Deliverance are amazing...but to list them would be to list key spoilers, and I don't want to do that. Overall, this movie is nothing new, but it plays old and clichéd material very well. (VERY MINOR SPOILER)I will say that the biggest complaint of all that I had was with Emilio's change of character right after his role morphed into heart of darkness mode, and Leary's character is in peril (involving him asking for help)...that one scene was so unbelievably cliché and out of place it wasn't even funny. (END OF VERY MINOR SPOILER)However, Judgment Night is pretty good entertainment that is carried by a solid, and believable villain, only to be brought down by subpar performances from actors that usually deliver better. Therefore, I have to give it a 7 out of 10 stars which isn't bad; a film I consider almost above average...Leary alone carried this film, and with better acting of the main leads, this would have scored much much higher.

Not that the film is necessarily bad, it's just very mixed. After viewing the film on DVD, the inordinate length of some scenes is enough to make one grateful for the PAL speedup. That the DVD released by Universal Home Video only has sixteen chapter stops, no subtitles, and a somewhat uneven audio mix, only serves to highlight the flaws in the film.Don't think that I am knocking this film simply because I have a short attention span. I have seen enough slow and languid films to know that sometimes, a slow story can be an intriguing story. But in order to make the viewer sit through a slow and languid piece, you have to compensate for the pace with character development and tension. Granted, there is tension in The Deer Hunter, but it is uneven, and insufficient to keep the viewer interested.As often happens in a film with an ensemble cast, the burden of keeping the story interesting falls upon its stars. This is one reason why The Deer Hunter would never be made in today's system. With some notable exceptions, the stars of today are just not compelling enough to hold interest. Robert De Niro demonstrates why he is one of the few stars to have won an Oscar for a role where most of his lines aren't in English. Even his bad films, the Rocky And Bullwinkle revival comes to mind, are a cut above some modern stars' best.John Savage, Christopher Walken, and John Cazale all demonstrate that they can act circles around most. While Cazale died long before his time, Savage and Walken have since appeared in numerous pieces where they make many other actors look as if they're not even trying. Here, their performances make their characters memorable long after one has forgotten about the story. Which is just as well, because some of the scenes are so distended, and not in a good way, that it truly boggles the mind to hear that there was ever a four-hour cut. The two-hour cut could have told the story with as much detail.I gave The Deer Hunter an eight out of ten. With a different cast, it would have been a four, but Robert De Niro, John Savage, Christopher Walken, and John Cazale all earn the film an extra point each.

This is one reason why The Deer Hunter would never be made in today's system. With some notable exceptions, the stars of today are just not compelling enough to hold interest.

It creates almost instant rapport by sympathetic central characters, even when the plot is a tedious retreaded farrago of numerous other flicks. This series has found sequeldom (albeit in the straight-to-video market) largely because of its unoriginal but amiable central character, the CIA mercenary-cum-pedagog, the teacher who's not really a teacher but is probably a better teacher than a lot of teachers we've had. He's not only there to dispense his wisdom, but also kick some butt on the baddies. In other words--what's not to like?The setup of The Substitute is completely implausible--a school so overrun by drug dealers that it's virtually run by them. In fact, even the principal is on the take. Who needs a spoiler? They virtually telegraph that fact to you before you know for sure. After a teacher gets kneecapped for confronting said dealers, her mercenary\/squeeze--adrift after having his last black op shut down (geez, how many times have we seen THAT in the movies?)--comes to the rescue and takes her place in her classroom. Tom Berenger is an excellent, understated center to this movie. Too bad his career has cratered after his brilliant performance in Platoon. Though he's worked steadily, it's been almost exclusively B movies you see at 2AM Sunday morning on the USA Network. Pretty-boy Charlie Sheen has remained in the spotlight and heck even Willem Dafoe has had more A-level roles than Tom. Must be that scary jawbone. Such a shame.

Suddenly in shops alongside the latest film would be classic films which had some weak link to Tarantino. One of these films was Killing Zoe. Written by Roger Avary, Tarantino's co-writer for Pulp Fiction (1994), the story was meant to be a sophisticated, France based, robbery story with class. Sadly however, Killing Zoe is a pointless, irrelevant movie with a 'straight to television' feel.Eric Stoltz plays Zed. Recently arrived in Paris, Zed sleeps with prostitute Zoe (the great Julie Delpy) before going on a drugs induced bender and then a bank raid. Unfortunately though, encountering Zoe again, her arrival has an impact on Zed.Written and directed by a co-writer of Pulp Fiction, this film should be good. This writer has gone hideously downhill over the years though. Writing and directing 2002's Rules Of Attraction was his more recent mistake (the film is an abomination of cinema), but this piece from eight years earlier is equally as huge a screw-up.It feels almost like a film story in itself how two friends can write a legendary film and whilst one can grow in strength, the other collapses. With films like this, the example has been proved though.As Zed, Eric Stoltz is tolerable, but nothing decent (the guy is a mediocre actor) whilst Julie Delpy (arguably, along with Juliette Binoche, one of France's finest two actresses of last ten years) is wasted in her role as the love interest \/ prostitute.All in all, the film just feels like it tries too hard. In comparison with Quentin's films which come with scary ease (that opening scene in Reservoir Dogs is perhaps one of the finest moments in cinema history), Avery seems to be trying far too hard with this film. Intentionally trying to intimidate us with a gun in an innocent woman's mouth, the fear is removed by the feeling of falseness. We never associate with ANY of the characters and we suffer as a result.Whilst a nice idea, the film also suffers from it's French connection. Attempting to combine the styles of recent American films with a European twist is a superb concept which does deserve further research. In 1994 however, whether a bit too early or not, the idea is just too excessive. Certain lines, whilst maybe superb, are destroyed by having them spoken in French. In effect, it would be like watching any early Tarantino film in a foreign language. We would get the words in subtitle, but we would miss the expression.All in all, Killing Zoe is a HUGE disappointment. Advertised ten years after release for being linked to Tarantino, the film lacks any of the skill which the director might be proud. Set in a foreign country with a cast we don't connect with, the story is cold and miserable. We see Stoltz and Delpy and all their co-stars and we don't connect to them at all. In the end of the day, your probably better off watching anything by Quentin, ignoring his friend Roger Avary's work, and just passing over Killing Zoe as a hopeless mistake.

Writing and directing 2002's Rules Of Attraction was his more recent mistake (the film is an abomination of cinema), but this piece from eight years earlier is equally as huge a screw-up.It feels almost like a film story in itself how two friends can write a legendary film and whilst one can grow in strength, the other collapses. With films like this, the example has been proved though.As Zed, Eric Stoltz is tolerable, but nothing decent (the guy is a mediocre actor) whilst Julie Delpy (arguably, along with Juliette Binoche, one of France's finest two actresses of last ten years) is wasted in her role as the love interest \/ prostitute.All in all, the film just feels like it tries too hard. In comparison with Quentin's films which come with scary ease (that opening scene in Reservoir Dogs is perhaps one of the finest moments in cinema history), Avery seems to be trying far too hard with this film. Intentionally trying to intimidate us with a gun in an innocent woman's mouth, the fear is removed by the feeling of falseness. We never associate with ANY of the characters and we suffer as a result.Whilst a nice idea, the film also suffers from it's French connection. Attempting to combine the styles of recent American films with a European twist is a superb concept which does deserve further research. In 1994 however, whether a bit too early or not, the idea is just too excessive. Certain lines, whilst maybe superb, are destroyed by having them spoken in French. In effect, it would be like watching any early Tarantino film in a foreign language. We would get the words in subtitle, but we would miss the expression.All in all, Killing Zoe is a HUGE disappointment. Advertised ten years after release for being linked to Tarantino, the film lacks any of the skill which the director might be proud. Set in a foreign country with a cast we don't connect with, the story is cold and miserable. We see Stoltz and Delpy and all their co-stars and we don't connect to them at all. In the end of the day, your probably better off watching anything by Quentin, ignoring his friend Roger Avary's work, and just passing over Killing Zoe as a hopeless mistake.

I just watched this movie again and the scenes of Micheal whacking the crooked cop and the other mobster family head and the scene where the director wakes up to find his favorite horse's head and blood all over and beneath his feet still shocks and stuns me... this movie portrayed the drama of it all elegantly and I love every minute of it. Although 2 things are odd... In the beginning when the first Godfather is being begged for help I was surprised that the beggar wasn't killed off then for being so disrespectful to Don Corneioli (I hope that's how it's spelled). I mean this guy is an infamous, murderous mobster who's career started out practically with a murder (As seen in the future Godfather movie) but he'd let someone who left him disrespected alive seems so uncharacteristic of the man. And also the length of the first wedding in the movie, the very first few scenes of this film, well... was horrible, I'll not lie. At the risk of being stoned by those in love with this movie I have to say that they had achieved the desired effect after the first or second deal the Godfather made, not entirely sure which it was since the movie lasted so long but I'm pretty sure not past 2. The rest of it was very nice and all and showed how he did business (bloody and death-ridden beneath a velvety, beautiful cover) but was it really necessary to do so much of it? Would've been just as effective if it had been otherwise than it turned out to be.
