Simon Birch has so much passionate power  that even knowing how the movie will close doesn't spoil the movie itself.The film opens with Jim Carry visiting a cemetery on a beautiful sunny day. He begins to tell a story about his child hood and how his life changed dramatically due to his friend's faith.That story basically follows the ups and down of their relationship. Joseph Mazzello plays the twelve year old befriending the growth impaired Simon. Simon Birch is a very smart boy for his age, that happens to be twelve. He is about four feet tall, but don't let his looks deceive you. In reality, his Sunday school teacher is secretly afraid of him due to his incredible faith. He believes God has put him on this earth for a reason and he plans to achieve that intention.He and his friend are members of the pee-wee baseball league, also. However, due to his Simon's miniature size, the coach tells him not to swing when he is up to bat. But one day when he is called to bat, he smacks the ball high into  the air&#133; only for it to be a foul ball. Oh, yeah, and it gains enough speed to fly at a woman in the sidelines and does something unexpected. Without revealing any details I will say what happens next changes the lives of these two friends forever.The thing I enjoyed the most about Simon Birch is the amazing emotional power generated by the colorful characters. At first I wasn't quite sure about this movie's figures, they seemed cocky and  nerdy. By the end, though, I began to realize just how much I cared for these characters, especially the warm-hearted and wise Simon Birch.As for the performances, they were just great. Joseph Mazzello, who is beginning to create a nice name for himself, delivers his best yet. Yes, even better than Jurassic Park. And Oliver Platt, who has been in more movies this year than Rodney Dangerfield has in the last decade (No offense, I actually think Rodney is one of the world's comic legends.) also portraits his character well. The big screen debut for Ian Michael Smith proves also to be a big hit with the audience.In my opinion, Simon Birch easily has more emotional power than the amazingly realistic Saving Private Ryan. That is because Ryan goes for the aggressive and pervasive tears while this film goes for a humble approach, even though Saving Private Ryan is a better movie.I'd give this movie ***1\/2 out of ****.

You must view it intelligently and carefully, and see it two or three times to be able to see the detail.It will be a misunderstood film, I think. Naturally, there is no ONE right way to view a film. The better the film, the more ways it can be viewed. But SPR has already been evaluated in a very unidimensional way.People have commented that there is a good action sequence at the beginning, a good action sequence at the end, a long boring middle with no character development, and 'bookend' sentimentality. The opening 25 minutes were very realistic...but is that all that the film is about? You can view it that way, but perhaps the film is more than a technically masterful B-film.The film's message is war is hell? If that's all it was, it would be shallow realism. A dog has four feet, war is hell, sugar is sweet. These are just preconditions for telling a story. Consider this possibility that the realism and attention to detail is MORE than the sound of bullets against steel or sand.Shallow character development? You don't know enough about the soldiers to care? What's that supposed to mean? That you look at a cross-filled cemetery and feel nothing? That you see a landing boat full of men killed before they can disembark and you feel nothing because you don't know who they were? Think about this veterans report not wanting to know anything about their fellow combatants. It made the loss more difficult. And isn't it interesting that part of the story of SPR has to do with the soldiers wondering who Captain Miller is. Why don't you ask yourself why? Character development? The war context has to do with how you behave there and then. That's how you assess each other. Now think about whether such a message can be carried to other everyday contexts. Observe the soldiers and how they behave. That long 'boring' bit in the middle?? That's the whole film! Look at the events and think why am I being shown this? Why not something else? Isn't it interesting that the ONE German soldier that Upham kills is the one who both killed Miller AND witnessed Upham's own failure to live up to his responsibilities (cowardice?).Go see the film a second time and think about it. Ask yourself why, amid the chaos of the Omaha beach landing, we are not only shown slow motion pans of Miller staring without comprehension at corpses and men cringed in fear, but also of him later, equally white-faced, staring at coffee being poured, at a man shaving, at a sandwich being eaten?A good film can work at several levels. Is this a war film? An anti-war film? Is that all that SPR is about? If so, then the so-called bookend pieces are indeed cheap sentimentality. But consider another hypothesis Perhaps the film is also a character study of one person in particular, of Captain Miller. And it's not simply about 'war'. The war is a context to make something else meaningful. No, not just earn this, something else.When I saw the film there was a veteran who began crying when another message was given, at the very end.Interesting, wasn't it, that we don't hear triumphant music and see the stars and stripes in full glory. We could have been shown this, but we weren't. We see a bleached out remnant of something almost unrecognizable as stars and stripes, and music dying away in a long sad whisper. Earlier, we hear Miller's own comments on the standard Emersonian line on the value of war Perhaps that's his way of seeing the good side of things. You can accuse Spielberg of being a sentimentalist. Miller HIMSELF would not buy the sentimentality interpretation.Whatever else the film might be, SPR is also good enough to give me something to think about after I view it.

The war context has to do with how you behave there and then. That's how you assess each other. Now think about whether such a message can be carried to other everyday contexts. Observe the soldiers and how they behave. That long 'boring' bit in the middle?? That's the whole film! Look at the events and think why am I being shown this? Why not something else? Isn't it interesting that the ONE German soldier that Upham kills is the one who both killed Miller AND witnessed Upham's own failure to live up to his responsibilities (cowardice?).Go see the film a second time and think about it. Ask yourself why, amid the chaos of the Omaha beach landing, we are not only shown slow motion pans of Miller staring without comprehension at corpses and men cringed in fear, but also of him later, equally white-faced, staring at coffee being poured, at a man shaving, at a sandwich being eaten?A good film can work at several levels. Is this a war film? An anti-war film? Is that all that SPR is about? If so, then the so-called bookend pieces are indeed cheap sentimentality. But consider another hypothesis Perhaps the film is also a character study of one person in particular, of Captain Miller. And it's not simply about 'war'. The war is a context to make something else meaningful. No, not just earn this, something else.When I saw the film there was a veteran who began crying when another message was given, at the very end.Interesting, wasn't it, that we don't hear triumphant music and see the stars and stripes in full glory. We could have been shown this, but we weren't. We see a bleached out remnant of something almost unrecognizable as stars and stripes, and music dying away in a long sad whisper. Earlier, we hear Miller's own comments on the standard Emersonian line on the value of war Perhaps that's his way of seeing the good side of things. You can accuse Spielberg of being a sentimentalist. Miller HIMSELF would not buy the sentimentality interpretation.Whatever else the film might be, SPR is also good enough to give me something to think about after I view it. Something else, about the rest of everyday life. Don't waste your time thinking about whether it's the best film ever,or the best war film ever, or how many academy awards it will win. Who cares?Forget about that guy looking for his arm on Omaha beach.View the film and then think about this Are YOU a good person? Are YOU living a good life?Then go back and look again at those dying and dead strangers and weep for your own life.Perhaps Spielberg made a better film than he intended...

Unusually, The Parent Trap is a children's film that can even be recommended for children by the most morally bound parent - although there is a divorce that may need to be explained away. The Parent Trap is cute, sugary and funny  - and unashamedly so. The Parent Trap was originally made in 1961 starring Haley Mills as a pair of twins who accidentally meet when they are eleven years old. Their parents divorced when they were babies. They then connive to get their parents back together. This is classic Disney material and the formula can and does work very well indeed in this modern version. Heaven only knows how the special effects are done but I suggest that you just forget about that and settle back and enjoy the film. You won't have any choice anyway. I was convinced that the twins must have been played by real life twins and I'm sure that I won't be the only one to fall for that particular Parent Trap. Young Lindsay Lohan plays the girls, (both of them!) complete with fabulous accents, sunny bright and distinctive personalities, appealing red hair, freckles and a great sense of fun. One of the girls has become a Londoner and one a Californian and the girls also sport very commendable English and American accents, as well as composites of the two accents when the girls switch places. It's also pleasing to see young girls being given the sorts of lightly rebellious antics to frolic with as are usually reserved for young boys. The story begins in a New England summer camp where practical jokes are the go, although the film is careful to keep nastiness well out of the way. It would be hard to accuse Lindsay Lohan's twins of any serious crime in any case. The girls decide to switch places so they can each meet their Mum and Dad. In true Hollywood style both parents are rich and attractive and they of course each have hired help (Lisa Anne Walter and Simon Kunz) who are of course are going to fall in love. But then we must have the wicked stepmother and this is provided by Meredith, a gold digger who's out to score the very rich hand of Dad. She's played with appropriate relish by Sharon Stone look alike Elaine Hendrix. The story really revolves around the parents, played by Natasha Richardson and Dennis Quaid. We can settle back and wait for the inevitable to happen, because we just know that this is going to be one of those happily ever after efforts where Mummy and Daddy will again fall in love and properly become parents for these two very cute and loving girls.

Undeterred, Chan tries again to strike Hollywood gold in New Line Cinema's RUSH HOUR, a buddy-cop picture that teams him with the highly energetic and very funny Chris Tucker.Chan, while amicable and charming as ever, is more the straight man in this pairing, playing -- what else? -- Hong Kong supercop, Detective Inspector Lee.  He goes to the U.S. at the request of his friend, Consul Han (played competently by Tzi Ma), whose 11-year-old daughter (the high-spirited Julia Hsu) has been kidnapped by a Chinese crime syndicate.  The FBI, however, have already launched their investigation by the time Han informs them of Lee's imminent arrival.  Not at all pleased that an international incident could develop with a foreign policeman getting involved, the Bureau agents ask the Los Angeles Police Department to supply someone to lead Lee on a wild goose chase to keep him out of the way.Into the picture comes Detective James Carter (played with zeal and relish by Chris Tucker) who is less than thrilled at having a babysitting assignment.  Determined not to be shut out of the big case, Carter calls upon his own resources to find leads while trying to keep Lee out of trouble.  This plan falls apart, however, when Lee escapes to find Han. Pretty soon, the two detectives who were not supposed to be involved with the case find themselves in the heart of it, much to the dismay of the FBI.This rather familiar story could have quite easily failed in the hands of the screenwriters.  It would have been too easy for them to use ethnic stereotypes as the source of friction and humour between Chan and Tucker. They, however, wisely avoid this route and come up with some truly funny dialogue, such as when Carter talks about how the L.A.P.D. are the most hated police force in the world and how even his mother is ashamed of his job.  She tells everybody I'm a drug dealer, he quips.At the comedic level, RUSH HOUR is a success, delivering one hilarious gag after another.  As an action picture, however, it is very ordinary, especially when compared with Chan's previous efforts.  Even MR. NICE GUY, with its insultingly bad script and horrendous acting, had some brilliant stunt choreography and truly original physical comedy.  By contrast, RUSH HOUR is very pedestrian and shows blatant signs of the rumoured restraints put on Chan by the production's insurers.The problem with the action sequences isn't confined to choreography, however.  The camera, true to the MTV style which is now so commonly used in American cinema, cuts away too much.  In Chan's Hong Kong productions, stunts are filmed with unbroken shots to give them a greater sense of reality.  Switching camera angles makes stunts look like they were camera tricks edited together, a sleight-of-hand done in the editing room rather than the no-stunt-double daring-do that Chan promises to his audience in every one of his movies.In the end, it would be fair to say that RUSH HOUR is not a true Jackie Chan film, even though it has his charm and his trademark outtake reel at the end (and a rather entertaining one, at that).  This is more of a showcase for Chris Tucker who, according to interviews Chan has given, injected his brand of comedy into the movie by ad lib-ing lines.RUSH HOUR may not be Jackie Chan's magnum opus but it's witty, lacks excessive violence, and, above all else, is a heck of a lot of fun.Rating  8.0 out of 10.0 ","genre":null},{"date":"21 September 1998","score":"","review":" It's been over a decade since THE PROTECTOR, the last American-made Jackie Chan vehicle, hit North American theatres and underwhelmed hardcore Jackie fans and neophytes alike.

This is more of a showcase for Chris Tucker who, according to interviews Chan has given, injected his brand of comedy into the movie by ad lib-ing lines.RUSH HOUR may not be Jackie Chan's magnum opus but it's witty, lacks excessive violence, and, above all else, is a heck of a lot of fun.Rating  8.0 out of 10.0 ","genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime"},{"date":"21 September 1998","score":"","review":" It's been over a decade since THE PROTECTOR, the last American-made Jackie Chan vehicle, hit North American theatres and underwhelmed hardcore Jackie fans and neophytes alike.  Undeterred, Chan tries again to strike Hollywood gold in New Line Cinema's RUSH HOUR, a buddy-cop picture that teams him with the highly energetic and very funny Chris Tucker.Chan, while amicable and charming as ever, is more the straight man in this pairing, playing -- what else? -- Hong Kong supercop, Detective Inspector Lee.  He goes to the U.S. at the request of his friend, Consul Han (played competently by Tzi Ma), whose 11-year-old daughter (the high-spirited Julia Hsu) has been kidnapped by a Chinese crime syndicate.  The FBI, however, have already launched their investigation by the time Han informs them of Lee's imminent arrival.  Not at all pleased that an international incident could develop with a foreign policeman getting involved, the Bureau agents ask the Los Angeles Police Department to supply someone to lead Lee on a wild goose chase to keep him out of the way.Into the picture comes Detective James Carter (played with zeal and relish by Chris Tucker) who is less than thrilled at having a babysitting assignment.  Determined not to be shut out of the big case, Carter calls upon his own resources to find leads while trying to keep Lee out of trouble.  This plan falls apart, however, when Lee escapes to find Han. Pretty soon, the two detectives who were not supposed to be involved with the case find themselves in the heart of it, much to the dismay of the FBI.This rather familiar story could have quite easily failed in the hands of the screenwriters.  It would have been too easy for them to use ethnic stereotypes as the source of friction and humour between Chan and Tucker. They, however, wisely avoid this route and come up with some truly funny dialogue, such as when Carter talks about how the L.A.P.D. are the most hated police force in the world and how even his mother is ashamed of his job.  She tells everybody I'm a drug dealer, he quips.At the comedic level, RUSH HOUR is a success, delivering one hilarious gag after another.  As an action picture, however, it is very ordinary, especially when compared with Chan's previous efforts.  Even MR. NICE GUY, with its insultingly bad script and horrendous acting, had some brilliant stunt choreography and truly original physical comedy.  By contrast, RUSH HOUR is very pedestrian and shows blatant signs of the rumoured restraints put on Chan by the production's insurers.The problem with the action sequences isn't confined to choreography, however.  The camera, true to the MTV style which is now so commonly used in American cinema, cuts away too much.

I cannot argue that the film is visually a work of art. Hiring Phillip Glass to write the music worked to underscore the visuals.The fatal flaw in the movie is that it never comes close to the emotional heights its essentially spiritual story requires. And that area is primarily within the director's job description. In other words, with the cinemaphotography and other visuals, the sets and the music, a director normally collaborates with others. So, if a film such as Kundun does not really move us despite the exquisite visuals and music, then one can only imagine how pedestrian it would have been without them.The process of transferring an idea from paper to film is a difficult and exasperating experience. Before I wrote about movies, I worked in them. My gut feeling is that a director's greatness is made through a minority of his output. For example, Spielberg fumbled the ball in Amistad, but turned right around and unleashed the triumphant Saving Private Ryan on an unsuspecting world.Martin, your next film should be a doosey!
