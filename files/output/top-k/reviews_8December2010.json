[{"date":"8 December 2010","score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Chuck Palahniuk creates thrilling, captivating works for the mind of his readers. He is the author of 14 novels, two of which have already been made into movies and three other novels being considered or already in production to be major motion pictures. The first of Palahniuk books to move to film was Fight Club. Fight Club is a gripping page-turner unable to be put down until you realize you've read through the entirety of it in one sitting. Luckily, the movie held true to the book and might've even done a better job telling the story of Tyler Durden. The twisting thriller keeps you suspended until it blows your mind. The actors in Fight Club carry the movie fantastically; Edward Norton as the narrator, Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden, and Helena Bonham Carter as Marla Singer. Norton narrates as a character in the movie that moves in a run down house with Tyler Durden and then shares the life of Tyler Durden with the viewers. Marla Singer, the antagonist works her way into their lives, driving them crazy. To unleash their building frustration and deal with their excess testosterone, Norton and Pitt create what they call Fight Club. The first rule of Fight Club is do not talk about Fight Club. The subtle hints in this film foreshadow beautifully. Small special effects and the ability to physically see the raise of an eyebrow or hear the narration while watching a fight scene actually happen add up to effectively blow your mind and make you question how you didn't see anything coming. The director, David Fincher, certainly shows his skill through this film. Seeing Fight Club and another of his dark, intense movies, Seven, it's simple to day this man has a unique vision. Fight Club is a must see. 10\/10!

I just felt as I was watching PORKY'S REVENGE that the laughs were few and far between although there were attempts to reestablish the raunch that appealed to audiences who loved the first film. I think it would've been more ideal to have this cast in college instead of in their senior year of high school as the stars simply look too old at this point to portray 18 year olds. That said there are some inspired moments here and there such as Pee Wee's flashing the parents attending the graduation ceremony on accident(he was tricked into getting nude underneath his robe by the gang)or when the boys have broken into the apartment of a hot biology teacher trying to find a test exam so that Meat(Tony Ganios)could cheat to pass so he could play in the State Basketball Championship, instead catching her in a bit of sexual rollplaying with another teacher. Nancy Parsons returns as Ms. Balbricker and the gang decide to find her lost love which is kind of a nice way to send her character off as she's often the butt of jokes(her hotel scene with Wyatt Knight's Tommy Turner is a laugh as both were expecting to meet other people, this arranged as a practical joke by the gang, although Pee Wee was the intended target for Balbricker). In this sequel, Porky(Chuck Mitchell)now operates an illegal casino on board a riverboat and has negotiated a deal with the boys regarding throwing the basketball championship so that their coach could be exonerated of the gambling debts he owes. Of course the boys plan to screw Porky and when fatso kidnaps Meat(he supposedly got Porky's ugly daughter pregnant after the two went all the way)during prom night they will have to orchestrate a rescue. The result isn't kind to Porky's boat! Mitchell is as repugnant and bullying as ever, the perfect foil for our high school heroes who once again get the best of him. This film features the big game as Angel Beach's basketball team go on a tear when Meat suddenly passes the test and is allowed to toss around the opposition like rag dolls(the referees seemed to have gone on a lunch break, I guess). A constant gag that I didn't really find all that funny has the principal questioning when Billy(Mark Herrier)is gonna set up a period where they can watch a certain art film(it's pornography and Balbricker told on them to the principal). Kaki Hunter is Tommy's girlfriend, Wendy, but she's essentially one of the guys always hanging out with them. Surprising amount of nudity in this sequel; mostly boobs. While a far cry from the first film, which had me laughing out loud quite a bit, PORKY'S REVENGE does come from a great period in the 80s when filmmakers were willing to go anywhere to get a giggle or make the viewer blush.

The idea (one hopes) was to make a powerful, topical docudrama, but the result is an ugly, artificial, irresponsible exploitation of an actual civil rights crisis, condescending to blacks (condemning their treatment at their expense) and elevated out of all proportion by a false sense of prestige. This is true tabloid cinema, not far removed from one of Chuck Bronson's 'Death Wish' scenarios, with enough burnings, beatings and lynchings to satisfy even the most unrepentant redneck, and with the gall to suggest that the most effective answer to bigotry is to adopt attitudes and methods even more violent than those of the Klan. A first-rate cast is totally wasted by Chris Gerolmo's one-dimensional screenplay (and not for the first time see 'Miles From Home'). If a film insists on asking questions like, where does it come from, all this hatred? the least it can do is attempt to provide a legitimate answer.
