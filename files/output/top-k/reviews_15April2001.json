He enjoys his solitude, enjoys scaring off the villagers who try to roust him out, and enjoys a nice bowl of eyeballs for lunch.Enter everyone in fairydom (major fairy tale cameos here).  Lord Farquard is clearing the fairy folk off his land and resettling them... in Shrek's swamp.Shrek and Donkey (a talking donkey Shrek accidentally saved from the resettlement squad and now can't seem to get rid of) go off to get Lord Farquard to get all these people out of Shrek's swamp.  The result is a bargain.  Shrek will rescue a cursed princess from a castle in a lava pit that's guarded by a dragon and Farquard will remove the fairy folk from the swamp.It's a cute movie and there are definitely some funny scenes.  It feels like they did a bit of tossing in everything but the kitchen sink when it comes to parodying fairy tales, some modern institutions, and even The Matrix, but the bulk of it works and what doesn't can be forgiven in the face of the many laughs that do come along.All in all, a good cuddly date movie if you've got an evening free, and a good family movie for the weekends.  I'd give it a 7\/10. ","genre":null},{"date":"15 April 2001","score":"1 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":"  Shrek is an ogre living in a swamp.
