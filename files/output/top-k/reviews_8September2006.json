The premise is pretty familiar if you've ever seen more than 5 movies that are rated 'R'. It's a shoot-em-up (lots of heroin and guns) with the familiar sexy antihero couple roaming around the American southwest playing a high stakes game and dealing with character issues (though in this movie we get a new twist because there are two couples instead of one and one of them is old, so you can watch it with your parents).That said, the cinematography is really easy on the eye and the acting is excellent. James Woods gives a great performance even though he plays the same character he plays in other movies he's been in (casino, once upon a time in America, the onion field). Many of the reviews of this film include some comparison to Lary Clark's other big film, kids. To me, it's hard to compare these movies because the intentions are so different. Which one you like better depends upon, well, what kind of movies you like (you probably would't like them both equally). I'm more of a 'kids' type of guy.Over all, a pretty decent flick. There's a lot of art and subtlety to the acting and there are some pretty powerful scenes. It could have used to loose some of the stanky Hollywood chiche's (how many brains have you seen get blown out in the movies in your lifetime?), but they can be fun I suppose. Maybe VH1 should have a 'top 100 brains getting blown out scenes' show.

The fact that this was one of the bloodiest and most violent games ever? The fact that this was the best fighting game ever or at least, the most well known worldwide? So you probably expect those two things 1) Gore and 2) Superb fight choreography in this movie huh? Sorry dude, you're gonna rip out your own pancreas out of yourself if thats what you expect. This movie is a complete kids flick. There isn't a single drop of blood. The closest thing to violence was a frozen guy shattering to pieces and that looked dumb too. The ultra-gory Fatality you are familiar with from the games, is now reduced to a guy dropping to the ground. Yech. How does one director take such liberties with stripping out the essence of what made a title and franchise so unique? OK so there's no violence but the fights must be great right? Wrong. These are some of the worst ever fight scenes you'll come across in your movie going life. The choreography is so poor that you may smash the TV. The Characters..mmmmm. They are interesting. Its like taking a bunch of hobos off the street and telling them that the fate of the planet lies in their ability to fight Mortal Kombat. Thats how important all the main characters plus all the others look. Putting a B or C grade cast into an A grade franchise is not a good idea.Was Rayden supposed to be real weirdo? I'll admit that Christopher Lambert did make him look and act really uniquely weird though. Starting off with what looks like putting a turban on Santa clause to really inexplicably weird behavior. Weird but nice. Maybe thats a plus? Shang TSung acted really weird too. He too looks utterly unimportant and insignificant for an all powerful sorcerer hes supposed to be? The guy looks the evil part but his acting was lousy. None of the other bad guys ever even looked bad or the fighters ever look like...fighters! They all looked like illegal immigrants kidnapped from the borders for this movie.Despite all its weaknesses and utter stupidity, this movie can sometimes be great fun to watch. Thats because of the great music and soundtrack it has. It has some rather interesting locales and some amateuerly constructed sets too. Funnily enough, the most exciting part of this movie was when the final credits were rolling and George Clinton's MK Title song was playing in the background. Seriously.There was also some good humor in the dialog. You can watch this movie not expecting anything great and you may even enjoy it. Kids below 10 years of age would probably like it better.

This story of a group of women and their relationships with each other and the others in their lives as portrayed through the seasons of Nachitoches, Louisiana is like chicken soup - familiar, nourishing, and always there when you want to reconnect. It starts with getting ready for a wedding at Easter. Actually, it starts with a newcomer to town (Anelle, brilliantly played by Darryl Hannah) getting a new job at the most successful beauty shop in town. Truvy's (played by Dolly Parton, giving her best performance) has become the gathering place for the group of women this movie will focus on. Meanwhile, at the Eatenton household, M'Lynn (Sally Field) is preparing for her daughter Shelby's (Julia Roberts) wedding. We meet this family and then get to see the next door neighbor, Ouiser (Shirley MacLaine) crossing swords with M'Lynn's husband, Drum. Back at Truvy's we also get to meet the former First Lady of Chinquipin Parish, Claree (Olympia Dukaukis). The story unfolds through Shelby's wedding and our discovery that she is a diabetic which will create problems later on, to the Christmas Festival, to a summer Independence day where we learn Shelby has had a baby boy, and see what having that baby has done to Shelby's health, to a Hallowwe'en that starts well but ends in a tragedy, to Eater again and the rebirth of the circle of life. The stories range from hysterical to touching and the interplay and dialog of the actresses are wonderful. My personal favorite funny part is Ouiser unknowingly walking into Truvy's during a discussion of how to tell if a man is gay (I still laugh till I cry during that scene). How are the performances? Sally Field as the matriarch of the Eatenton family is a tower of strength, and then shows her strength through tragedy. This is Julia Roberts' finest performance ever, the most natural and genuine part she has played. (If you were wondering, I hate Pretty Woman) Just watch the scene at Christmastime between Sally and Julia and you will understand. Dolly Parton gives a performance instead of playing Dolly, and she may be my favorite character. I have read people say they felt Shirley MacLaine overplayed Ouiser, but I understand it. Ouiser is a larger than life character and is well served by Shirley. I have never been much of a fan of Darryl Hannah until I saw this movie. I thought she brought life to what could have been a cardboard character. Olympia Dukaukis is great as Claree, showing that life needn't end because you are a widow. I think of these women as friends and regularly enjoy seeing them when I watch this wonderful film.

At the time, WBN, a small, fictional station set in Chicago, Illinois was to become the fourth national radio network in the United States. Everyone was ready for the big night. The investors were relaxing in the lounge awaiting a good show. The writers were rewriting their scripts and the actors were poised and ready.WBN was going to make a huge splash as the number four station in the nation! Well that is, if anyone was alive by the end of the night. There seemed to be a small problem at WBN during the national premiere. The problem was murder. There were numerous problems. Murder really was not the only one.This farcical comedy has all the elements to make you laugh, shock you, and leave you satisfied if you're looking at it from a non-traditional view.Multiple plots weave throughout Radioland Murders that all revolve around the WBN national broadcast. The story begins with a soon-to-be divorced husband (Roger) and wife (Penny), played by Mary Stuart Masterson (of Fried Green Tomatoes fame) and Brian Benben (from Dream On).It seems that Roger Henderson had a roving eye, which landed him flat on his back. The real problem, though, was that his loving wife Penny caught him with the Va-Va-Voom girl, Claudette Katsenback (Anita Morris). While Penny tried to keep WBN organized as the station manager's secretary, Roger ignored his writing duties in an attempt to get his wife back.Soon we are introduced to the director, Walt Whalen Jr. (played by Jeffrey Tambor). Walt Whalen Jr. is only the director because Walt Whalen Sr. (Ned Beatty) is the owner of the WBN network. Junior isn't a very good director.If you're in the film industry you can't help but laugh at his inept ability to direct or even make simple decisions for himself. Many times Whalen looks on with his trademark blank stare as he adjusts his toupee, whimpering over the need to decide whether to cue music or the announcer. Usually it is up to Penny to chime in with the proper direction.This is just the tip of the iceberg. One of the band members dies on stage. The scripts are horrible and late arriving after having to be re-written at the last minute and everyone is in an emotional rush. To make matters worse, a strange voice keeps coming over the intercom and no one knows where it is coming from. All they do know is that someone gets popped every time they hear the voice and no one knows who is going to be next.They also know that every time someone is murdered, the person attached to the scene of the crime is Roger Henderson. Sure, Roger is bumbling, clumsy, and maybe even untrustworthy (just ask his wife), but a murderer? Radioland Murders takes you through the performance on the scene as they try to determine who is murdering the staff of WBN and who is going to be next.It clocks in at close to two hours. If you are a fan of farcical comedies, it will feel like the movie is just the right length. You don't feel rushed and the multiple plots are entertaining as you watch them unfold. Whether you are trying to guess who did it during this whodunit or not, the character development will amuse you.Celebrities fill the lineup in this movie from well known names like Masterson, George Burns (this was his last movie) and Rosemary Clooney to many names you won't recognize that are attached to people with faces that will look all too familiar.If you're a fan of vintage ideas and radio shows you will find this movie to be a treat. This type of movie is rare, as is its fan base, so this movie will not appeal to everyone. If you are a fan of the movie Noises Off, then Radioland Murders should be right up your alley.The critics were not fond of this movie when it came out and many wondered what George Lucas was thinking when he came up with the idea. However, you cannot always believe the hype of critics and if you are one that this type of movie appeals to. you will be in theatrical heaven.I went in not sure what to expect. I was expecting more of a drama because of the movie's title. By nature I am a much bigger fan of dramas than comedies. This one hit me by surprise though. I began laughing almost immediately and continued to do so most of the way through. It was not the typical movie by any stretch, but that is what made it worth watching.I recommend you check it out as a rental before you buy it. If you like it, buy it. It is one of those movies, which you will want to watch more than once. This is especially true if you get the meaning, the context, and the slapstick enjoyment from the melodrama of the radio celebrities in Radioland Murders.I give it four stars.

","genre":"Comedy, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"8 September 2006","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" The year 1939 was a hectic year for radio especially if you were working at WBN. At the time, WBN, a small, fictional station set in Chicago, Illinois was to become the fourth national radio network in the United States. Everyone was ready for the big night. The investors were relaxing in the lounge awaiting a good show. The writers were rewriting their scripts and the actors were poised and ready.WBN was going to make a huge splash as the number four station in the nation! Well that is, if anyone was alive by the end of the night. There seemed to be a small problem at WBN during the national premiere. The problem was murder. There were numerous problems. Murder really was not the only one.This farcical comedy has all the elements to make you laugh, shock you, and leave you satisfied if you're looking at it from a non-traditional view.Multiple plots weave throughout Radioland Murders that all revolve around the WBN national broadcast. The story begins with a soon-to-be divorced husband (Roger) and wife (Penny), played by Mary Stuart Masterson (of Fried Green Tomatoes fame) and Brian Benben (from Dream On).It seems that Roger Henderson had a roving eye, which landed him flat on his back. The real problem, though, was that his loving wife Penny caught him with the Va-Va-Voom girl, Claudette Katsenback (Anita Morris). While Penny tried to keep WBN organized as the station manager's secretary, Roger ignored his writing duties in an attempt to get his wife back.Soon we are introduced to the director, Walt Whalen Jr. (played by Jeffrey Tambor). Walt Whalen Jr. is only the director because Walt Whalen Sr. (Ned Beatty) is the owner of the WBN network. Junior isn't a very good director.If you're in the film industry you can't help but laugh at his inept ability to direct or even make simple decisions for himself. Many times Whalen looks on with his trademark blank stare as he adjusts his toupee, whimpering over the need to decide whether to cue music or the announcer. Usually it is up to Penny to chime in with the proper direction.This is just the tip of the iceberg. One of the band members dies on stage. The scripts are horrible and late arriving after having to be re-written at the last minute and everyone is in an emotional rush. To make matters worse, a strange voice keeps coming over the intercom and no one knows where it is coming from. All they do know is that someone gets popped every time they hear the voice and no one knows who is going to be next.They also know that every time someone is murdered, the person attached to the scene of the crime is Roger Henderson. Sure, Roger is bumbling, clumsy, and maybe even untrustworthy (just ask his wife), but a murderer? Radioland Murders takes you through the performance on the scene as they try to determine who is murdering the staff of WBN and who is going to be next.It clocks in at close to two hours. If you are a fan of farcical comedies, it will feel like the movie is just the right length. You don't feel rushed and the multiple plots are entertaining as you watch them unfold. Whether you are trying to guess who did it during this whodunit or not, the character development will amuse you.Celebrities fill the lineup in this movie from well known names like Masterson, George Burns (this was his last movie) and Rosemary Clooney to many names you won't recognize that are attached to people with faces that will look all too familiar.If you're a fan of vintage ideas and radio shows you will find this movie to be a treat. This type of movie is rare, as is its fan base, so this movie will not appeal to everyone. If you are a fan of the movie Noises Off, then Radioland Murders should be right up your alley.The critics were not fond of this movie when it came out and many wondered what George Lucas was thinking when he came up with the idea. However, you cannot always believe the hype of critics and if you are one that this type of movie appeals to. you will be in theatrical heaven.I went in not sure what to expect. I was expecting more of a drama because of the movie's title. By nature I am a much bigger fan of dramas than comedies. This one hit me by surprise though. I began laughing almost immediately and continued to do so most of the way through. It was not the typical movie by any stretch, but that is what made it worth watching.I recommend you check it out as a rental before you buy it. If you like it, buy it. It is one of those movies, which you will want to watch more than once. This is especially true if you get the meaning, the context, and the slapstick enjoyment from the melodrama of the radio celebrities in Radioland Murders.I give it four stars.

I believe this is one heap of steaming, stinking poop. And it's barely an excuse that it's based on a true story. It's ridiculous to get more than mildly impressed with the achievements of poor ugly duckling Rudy. I mean, it's hard for me to let myself go gaga for someone that is so obsessed with a senseless, brutal, IQ deficient game as football. I played some football in school and never thought much more of it than as a good workout and an opportunity to vent savagely. Any hope of being mentally challenged vanishes when it becomes clear that the 300 pound illiterate coming at you is hoping to introduce you to your maker. The only smart move is to run. I was undersized, not quite as much as Rudy, but I at least had sense enough to recognize the dangers as pointless. Daniel E. 'Rudy' Ruettiger, in all fairness, just doesn't have the intellectual capacity for this awareness, so maybe he can be excused. But apparently neither do the film's creators express a broader awareness in this overly sentimental Rah Rah Cheer fest. Corny musical cues, rousing poetic pep talks, fast cut game day montages are all great devices, but artistic or even social value demand more than making you feel good. You should be enlightened, broadened, and even &#x97; yeah I'm gonna say it &#x97; educated; or have you forgotten that this is a COLLEGE sports story. The better filmmakers educate very subtly, indirectly. North Dallas Forty did exactly that, all the while respecting the efforts and sacrifices made by our modern day gladiators. And to a certain degree so did The Longest Yard, where at least the bone crushing, spine snapping, brain melting criminally savage violence is occurring where it's slightly more appropriate &#x97; behind prison bars. And the fact that college sports, even back in 1975, especially football, are such commercially dominated, ultimately corrupt enterprises, is never addressed. It all adds up to just a short sighted, simple minded celebration of a clichéd and hollow conception of a now somewhat disreputable athletic activity. Rudy is shamelessly manipulative; it's cynically pandering to a deluded public &#x97; that's you.People who compare this film to Rocky forget that for many of us fans of that 70s classic, that film's greatest winning quality was it's comical manner, it's absurd self indulgence. I don't cheer for Rocky because he's the under dog, I cheer because the film actually acknowledges just how ridiculous the whole overblown, fantastical myth really is. I am often laughing AT it, just as it's talented director, John G. Avildsen, intended. The Rocky series immediately thereafter plummeted into a steep decline, thanks entirely to Mr. Stallone's demented control. Though Avildsen received directing credit for Rocky V, it was in name only, as he later complained publicly how Sylvester had commandeered the entire production and overrode all directorial decisions. The fabulous product speaks for itself. My point being that I'm rarely impressed with strait forward sports yarns, especially when they strive for allegorical significance. And even worse, when they're so earnestly contrive to be inspiring. Rudy is not a total failure because it's a fairly decent story, and it has some clever writing and great acting, particularly from Sean Astin. But the film avoids the bigger, obvious issue of Football's dubious social value, and never bothers to question the way we all let ourselves be lessened by it. OK, yeah, maybe we really are just primitive, aggressive animals, but indulging and celebrating the destructive, inhuman aspect of our natures is just as worthless as denying it.

Davis plays Mildred, a slutty, manipulative, greedy low-life to Howard's masochistic, club-footed Philip. He first meets her when she's a waitress, and she allows him to take her out to dinner and theater while she frolics with a wealthy older man (Alan Hale Sr.). In truth, Mildred is repulsed by Philip's club foot. On his part, Philip seems to enjoy the abuse of her open flirtation and her coolness toward him. He allows Mildred to bleed him dry financially in between boyfriends who drop her when they tire of her, while he blows off a couple of truly lovely women (Kay Johnson and Frances Dee). When he gets the gumption to throw her out, Mildred trashes his apartment and robs him, forcing him to withdraw from medical school and lose his lodgings.Of Human Bondage looks rather stilted today in parts. Though Leslie Howard was a wonderful actor and attractive, his acting style is of a more formal old school, and as a result, he tends to date whatever he's in. He shines in material like his role opposite Davis in It's Love I'm After or The Petrified Forest which call for his kind of technique.

When he gets the gumption to throw her out, Mildred trashes his apartment and robs him, forcing him to withdraw from medical school and lose his lodgings.Of Human Bondage looks rather stilted today in parts. Though Leslie Howard was a wonderful actor and attractive, his acting style is of a more formal old school, and as a result, he tends to date whatever he's in. He shines in material like his role opposite Davis in It's Love I'm After or The Petrified Forest which call for his kind of technique. His dated acting is even more obvious here because Davis was forging new ground with a gritty, edgy performance that would really make her name. If she seems at times over the top, she came from the stage, and the subtleties of film acting would emerge later for her. Contrast this performance with the restraint, warmth and gentleness of her Henriette in All This, and Heaven Too or the pathos she brought to Dark Victory. She was a true actress and a true artist. Davis really allows herself to look like holy hell; Mildred's deterioration is absolutely pathetic as Philip seems to gain strength as her spirit fades.An excellent film in which to see the burgeoning of one of film's greatest stars.

Thus he is banished from his people and he begins to seek the great Forest Spirit in order to get cured. On his journeys he befriends whit the people of Iron Town and he sets up on another mission as well to try to get the people and the forest to live together in harmony.The animation and music is just wonderful. The scenery and characters work perfectly and the tempo of the film is almost perfectly balanced between calm moments and action. I haven't seen the original with Japanese voice actors, but I quite liked the English voice cast. At least they sounded like they were interested in doing their jobs and they did it quite nicely.'Princess Mononoke' is a rare gem of animation, aimed towards a bit more mature audience than your average Dinsey films, that while keeps you thrilled whit the beautiful writing and well fleshed out characters, it also gives you something to think about. It can be seen as a statement of how industrialization is good for people in the short term, but how it will eventually turn the surroundings around us, thus destroying the legacy of later generations to come.While many other animations will wither in time, I'm sure that 'Princess Mononoke' will be remembered as one of the classics of animation throughout the time.

In that it more or less has the same storyline about aliens coming from deep space in order to not only prevent the people of earth from killing themselves in a nuclear holocaust but also from destroying their intergalactic neighbors as well. It's also interesting to note that the two films began and ended the 1950's. The Day the Earth Stood still in 1951 and Plan Nine from Outer Sapace in 1959.Traveling hundreds of millions of miles in space a giant spaceship lands right in the middle of Washington D.C as a shocked and terrified nation, and world looks on. Emerging from the spaceship is Klaatu, Michael Rennie, who after announcing himself offers a gift from his planet to the President of the United States. Frightened at Klaatu's gesture a soldier, one of the hundreds surrounding the spaceship, opens fire hitting and wounding Klaatu. This brings out Klaatu's partner an eight-foot tall menacing looking robot Gort, Lock Martin. Gort with some kind of killer ray, shooting out of his helmet, almost destroys the entire city until Klaatu, wounded but still conscious, orders him to stop.Taken to Walter Reed Army Hospital Klaatu tells those in the military and government who are, what seems like, debriefing him that he's here on a mission of peace. Klaatu wants all the leaders of earth to assemble in one place, like the UN, where he can give the massage he has for them Disarm and desist from war or else his planet, as well as the other planets in his confederation, would have to do the job of disarming the nations of earth themselves with disastrous results.Not getting any results from those he talks to Klaatu escapes from the hospital and take on the name of Carpenter and finds a place to stay at a rooming house run by WWII widow Helen Benson, Patricia Neal, and her 12 year-old son Bobby, Billy Gray. As the entire nation has an all out police and military dragnet looking for Klaatu he, now the very human charming and likable Mr. Carpenter, goes about the city with little Billy sightseeing. Klaatu even exposes himself, that he's as the man who everyone wants to behind bars or dead, by going to see the Albrt Einstein like Prof. Barnhardt (Sam Jaffe) who's considered to be the smartest man in the world according to Billy. Breaking and entering into the professor's home Carpenter\/Klaatu corrects and completes a complicated physics equation that the professor has been working on, and stymied at every turn, for months.It now becomes evident to the genius Prof. Barnhardt that Klaatu, or Mr. Carpenter, is the man from space that the entire country is looking for. It's later when Klaatu talks to him Prof. Barnhardt is startled at Klaatu's suggestion, more like a demand, of him getting all the top scientists and philosophers on earth to tell their governments his important massage The immediate peace and disarmament of their nations or else face total destruction.Being made at the hight of The Cold, and Korean, War it's a miracle that the film  The Day the Earth Stood Still was not only released but seemed to have both US Governments and military approval as well as participation in it. It's also ironic that a year after the films release, in late July 1952, there was an actual invasion of UFO's that penetrated Washington D.C airspace the most sensitive and heavily defended on earth. As it was later found out due to top secret documents released through The Freedom of Inmformaton Act this UFO invasion almost triggered a Third World War! With the top leaders of the US Government ,from President Truman on down, thinking it was an invasion from the USSR.Shot again by US military personnel as he and Helen tried to evade the dragnet out to get him Klaatu tells Helen before he expired to go back to the spaceship and give Gort this Very important massage Klaatu Berada Nikto, meaning as far as I could figure out Klaatu says cool it in space talk. That message to Gort will prevent the indestructible giant from doing a number not only on the US Capital but the entire planet.Helen getting Gort to desist from destroying the city, with Klaatu massage, he then goes back to the prison when Klaatu's body is. After breaking in Gort takes Klaatu back to the spaceship when he had taken Helen earlier. Through some kind of intense electoral jolt that Gort preforms of his dead body he brings Klaatu miraculously back to life.The movie ends with Klaatu speaking to Prof. Bernhardt and an assembly of top scientists from all over the world. In his speech Klaatu tells them that if they can't keep their governments from making bigger and more destructive nuclear weapons, that will not only destroy their planet but the entire universe as well, an army of intergalactic policemen, like Gort, will be sent out to stop them with unimaginable and total destruction. Undoubtedly one of the best through-provoking and most of all effective sci-fi movies ever made. Not just because of it's special effects but it's massage from the Spaceman Klaatu. A massage that makes it as clear as crystal to anyone who hears it if we can't learn to live together with our neighbors, despite our differences in politics religion and culture, we in the final analysis won't be able to live at all.

","genre":"Drama, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"8 September 2006","score":"","review":" (There are Spoilers) More of a anti-war then a sci-fi movie The Day the Earth Stood Still is also a lot like the very maligned and laughed at, considered by many to be the worst movie ever made, the Ed Wood epic Plan Nine from Outer Space. In that it more or less has the same storyline about aliens coming from deep space in order to not only prevent the people of earth from killing themselves in a nuclear holocaust but also from destroying their intergalactic neighbors as well. It's also interesting to note that the two films began and ended the 1950's. The Day the Earth Stood still in 1951 and Plan Nine from Outer Sapace in 1959.Traveling hundreds of millions of miles in space a giant spaceship lands right in the middle of Washington D.C as a shocked and terrified nation, and world looks on. Emerging from the spaceship is Klaatu, Michael Rennie, who after announcing himself offers a gift from his planet to the President of the United States. Frightened at Klaatu's gesture a soldier, one of the hundreds surrounding the spaceship, opens fire hitting and wounding Klaatu. This brings out Klaatu's partner an eight-foot tall menacing looking robot Gort, Lock Martin. Gort with some kind of killer ray, shooting out of his helmet, almost destroys the entire city until Klaatu, wounded but still conscious, orders him to stop.Taken to Walter Reed Army Hospital Klaatu tells those in the military and government who are, what seems like, debriefing him that he's here on a mission of peace. Klaatu wants all the leaders of earth to assemble in one place, like the UN, where he can give the massage he has for them Disarm and desist from war or else his planet, as well as the other planets in his confederation, would have to do the job of disarming the nations of earth themselves with disastrous results.Not getting any results from those he talks to Klaatu escapes from the hospital and take on the name of Carpenter and finds a place to stay at a rooming house run by WWII widow Helen Benson, Patricia Neal, and her 12 year-old son Bobby, Billy Gray. As the entire nation has an all out police and military dragnet looking for Klaatu he, now the very human charming and likable Mr. Carpenter, goes about the city with little Billy sightseeing. Klaatu even exposes himself, that he's as the man who everyone wants to behind bars or dead, by going to see the Albrt Einstein like Prof. Barnhardt (Sam Jaffe) who's considered to be the smartest man in the world according to Billy. Breaking and entering into the professor's home Carpenter\/Klaatu corrects and completes a complicated physics equation that the professor has been working on, and stymied at every turn, for months.It now becomes evident to the genius Prof. Barnhardt that Klaatu, or Mr. Carpenter, is the man from space that the entire country is looking for. It's later when Klaatu talks to him Prof. Barnhardt is startled at Klaatu's suggestion, more like a demand, of him getting all the top scientists and philosophers on earth to tell their governments his important massage The immediate peace and disarmament of their nations or else face total destruction.Being made at the hight of The Cold, and Korean, War it's a miracle that the film  The Day the Earth Stood Still was not only released but seemed to have both US Governments and military approval as well as participation in it. It's also ironic that a year after the films release, in late July 1952, there was an actual invasion of UFO's that penetrated Washington D.C airspace the most sensitive and heavily defended on earth. As it was later found out due to top secret documents released through The Freedom of Inmformaton Act this UFO invasion almost triggered a Third World War!

Straying habitually close to the same story that makes up what the Moral Tales are about, this one concerns a frisky female, Haydee (Haydee Politoff), who captures the attention and equal repulsion of two other young men Daniel (Daniel Pommereulle), an artist with a penchant for making art that literally cuts its viewers who aren't sharp, and Adrien (Patrick Bauchau), a young art dealer who is soon to make a lucrative purchase from an American artist.Haydee is first seen in a frank, objectified way walking on the beach of Saint Tropez, alone, as the camera lingers on her face (reminiscent of Charlize Theron), her torso, her legs. It's, in a way, Rohmer's mode of possibly depersonalizing his heroine since she remains a murky character with little definition -- one moment submissive, another moment quite take-charge, but always obscure. It's also a way of introducing her carefree way to the viewer; had she been introduced as a buttoned-down, prim female, it would have been clear her role would be that of a woman of stiff mores. But, as we see throughout the movie, Haydee is living in the middle of the swinging Sixties and she could care less about those things. Nor if her partying disturbs the sleep of Adrien or Daniel.Their share at the summer house in Saint Tropez is anything but placid. The two men are appalled at her behavior and decide not to have sex with Haydee for her own good. Adrien even decides to dub her The Collector -- a moniker that makes up the title of the movie and points at a spiteful machismo because where men can be womanizers and be called studs, women who take on this attitude are sanctioned. He stays at a distance from Haydee as she becomes involved with Daniel. Their liaison, however, becomes rocky and both soon part ways, leaving Haydee and Adrien with an open door to come one step closer. In a shocking move, Adrien offers her to a prospective client in order to secure a Song vase. Surprisingly, she accepts, not without an incident involving the aforementioned vase, which in turn leads Haydee right into Adrien's arms.Rohmer's movie is not without its Rohmerisms where characters introduce themselves with lengthy discussions as to the nature of life, love, attractions, and repulsions. In fact, every character minus Haydee does so, which makes her the more elusive and difficult to describe. Is she just floating along with what the men think they want? Or is she really clueless, a woman who has a simple view on life and who doesn't find any guilt in her actions? Interestingly enough, her philosophy is rather close to that of Adrien's girlfriend (every male character in his Six Moral Tales arc has a steady) who sees love as universal, indifferent to beauty or ugliness. That Haydee acts upon Adrien's girlfriend's statement says a lot more about who the girlfriend might be, but sheds an accessible light on Haydee.And anyways, she comes off better than any of the two men, as do the other females of Rohmer's sextet -- Maud, Laura, or Chloe. (It's also interesting that all of the other women are mainly brunette and aggressive or assertive in temper, whereas the ideal one is frequently blond or passive in character.) Even when objectified, there is a mysterious likability within her that is missing in his two male leads. Adrien is a little hypocritical of his own observant nature and while he openly derides Haydee he also wants her. Daniel is a dark guy in this story and in all of the Six Moral Tales collection, not just because of his pain-inducing art, but a veneer of violence just underneath his arrogant demeanor. Maybe, in this story -- as well as all of his others -- Rohmer seems to be the Ultimate Observer, painting a picture in regards to immature men, their attraction to a worldly female, and their decision to remain in a complacent union with another one that can only be there as a Barbie doll.
