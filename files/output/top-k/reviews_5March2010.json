Hollywood's idea of a dysfunctional family is Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt, two very successful parents, raising twelve children. In a movie like Cheaper by the Dozen, we do not feel the slightest bit sorry for the neglected youngest child. In contrast, Vinterberg is able to bring the audience into his movie and feel the raw emotion. Vinterberg captures this through his new artistic Dogme elements along with his remarkable cast. These stand out cast members play the roles of Christian (Ulrich Thomsen), the successful restaurateur whose twin sister recently committed suicide; Michael (Thomas Bo Larsen), the short-fused son with a bitter wife; and Helene (Paprika Steen), the rebellious daughter.The family is gathering for Helge's 60th birthday at the hotel. He is accompanied by his wife Elsa, his daughter Helene, and his two sons Michael and Christian, among others. All of the children begin to arrive and get comfortable in their rooms. Helene is far from comfortable when she begins to unpack in her deceased sister's room where she finds a suicide note, but decides to keep it to herself. At dinner, Christian accuses his father of raping him and his deceased sister, Linda. The family gathering continues to heat up for the duration of the movie. During Christian's toast at the celebration dinner he reveals that his father sexually abused him and his sister. The family reacts by merely ignoring and telling him that this is absurd. Vinterberg's brilliance is portrayed by his ability to keep the viewer attached to Christian and concerned while we do not know if this accusation had really occurred in his childhood. Instead we are left contemplating, as if we were sitting in the very dinning room they were, like the rest of the family. We are hammered with the statement, Here is to the man who killed my sister. The rules (Vow of Chastity) that make Dogme 95 what it is are the sole reason for the deep emotional connection that the viewer feels. The hand-held camera is used in artistic ways that serve different purposes throughout the movie. Most often the viewers are allowed to feel like they are a part of the scene due to the placement and movement of the camera. The use of the camera is also used to show the different personalities of the main characters. The movie begins with Christian in the distance walking towards the camera. Immediately, the viewer sees this character as enigmatic, and after his confession his story remains a puzzle until the very end. You feel Helene's sense of importance to the family when we witness her taxi ride to the party. The camera makes it seem as if you were sticking your head out the window as the driver weaves in and out of the lane to get to the party. Vinterberg's clever camera use also exemplifies the obscurity of the dead sister Linda. The camera carefully follows the signs and gives us an impression that she may be their haunting the room Helene is residing in. Lastly, the constant quivering of the camera exemplified the uneasiness that all the family members were feeling as they anxiously tried to leave. Even if the viewer's stomach does not agree with this trembling camera, I feel that Vinterberg is still able to depict the intense emotion and suspense.The next important element of the way that Vinterberg captures this family catastrophe is the lighting. Dogme 95 requires that the film does not use special lighting. Only criticized for breaking this rule once in The Celebration for covering a window, Vinterberg truly captures the mood through the use of natural lighting. The beginning of the movie begins in the mid-afternoon on a beautiful day. It was portrayed that most everyone was arriving putting on a content face to make the day for Helge. As the hours pass by the natural dark lighting accurately brings out the gloomy and sinister mood that has come to pass because of the alleged abuse and secrecy of the deceased sister. As the celebration drags into the night the camera is grainy and dark, but Vinterberg is still able to hold onto his crowd until the end. We are still entangled by the mystery that little tricks like these may go easily unobserved by viewers.One element that does not make sense to me is the title that Vinterberg chose for this movie. When someone thinks of a celebration, the first thing to come to mind is happiness. From the very beginning we get the feeling that this may not be a very pleasant birthday celebration. It also seems that there is an underlying tone of irony. Christian makes a serious accusation towards his father, and Vinterberg is trying to make a play for some laughs. This is not kind of humor that a westerner like me would understand. Therefore, I still stand questioning the title and sense of humor Vinterberg uses.Vinterberg was recently interviewed in Rome saying, I like to be on thin ice, and this was definitely the case in his conception of the first Dogme movie. As an American, I would not typically choose to watch a film like this one, but Vinterberg has given me the opportunity to witness a piece of art through a low budget film produced with a simple hand-held camera. For once, I was able to experience strong emotional empathy for the characters in the movie. The screenplay is written so well that I can appreciate it regardless of the fact that I am not familiar with the language or the actors. The Dogme 95 rules create an effect that makes the viewer feel like they are there with the characters. No matter what, Vinterberg has your attention until the final minute of this movie.

The emotions have been captured into the characters' faces brilliantly and the facial expressions that we see are almost like painted on the big screen. They fit so well with the scenes. In Lost Highway David Lynch takes the viewer to a strange, surrealistic world full of violence, exploitation and horror. One might be afraid and even sickened of this world, but eventually if one pays attention one will see that the world of Lost Highway doesn't differ much from the world we live in.I saw this on the big screen and it added some great extra feeling to the film. In the beginning the credits are actually thrown at your face while going on a highway road and listening to David Bowie's song I'm Deranged. Also be ready to notice some other familiar songs by famous artists\/bands, including Rammstein, Marilyn Manson, Nine Inch Nails, Smashing Pumpkins and much more. And the songs most certainly not are just randomly picked up.David Lynch's way of combining modern popular music with classical music is brilliant and unique. He's a man who's a great script-writer, director, musician and painter. The music for Lost Highway was composed by Angelo Badalamenti, with whom David Lynch had already worked with. He had composed the theme music for Lynch's TV-series Twin Peaks and the music for Blue Velvet (1986) and Wild at Heart (1990). David probably had a powerful effect on the music Badalamenti composed for Lost Highway, because of his understanding and own musical talent. Badalamenti and Lynch have even published a classical instrumental album together.Just as Alfred Hitchcock modernized the genre of horror and thriller, David Lynch keeps modernizing surrealism. For these kind of movies you can't define an exact genre. By these kind of movies I mean postmodern films. The fact that you can't know what is the genre of the film you're watching might be a problem for a mainstream movie-goer. For that kind of person this movie will be pretty boring and sick. But for people who are interested in art and like non-commercial movies, this will be a treat. Lost Highway is all about thinking, it's built on postmodern philosophy and its conception of realities. Basically the story is this Fred Madison (Bill Pullman) is a jazz saxophonist, who lives with his wife Renee Madison (Patricia Arquette) in a simplified modern house. You don't get to know the actual city but it looks like it is somewhere in California, probably in Los Angeles, because of the references to materialism and superficiality. Suddenly videotapes start appearing next to their door. The tapes show us that someone has been videotaping their house. After a while Fred meets a Mystery Man at his friend's party, which leads to a series of surreal and absurd events.A major thing this movie is having a replica, which I think one should keep in mind. It also deals with people's mind - the sickness of it, thoughts, memories and cruelty of humans. This movie can and should be analyzed a lot. But I will leave that enjoyment to you, I didn't want to read any analyses before watching Lost Highway. I would just like to recommend you to pay attention to the sound scape of the film and to the faces of the characters. Lost Highway is metaphysics, it's a postmodern philosophical film about reality and our existence. 9\/10 Brilliantly well made postmodern film, which can be watched over and over again until you die, you will never know this film so well that you couldn't watch it.

But things don't add up right, and Holly suspects murder... and the contradictory answers Lime's friends are giving him don't make this suspicion any less clear.To get prepared for this film, I read the book first. Some of the details have been removed from Graham Greene's novella, not surprisingly -- sadly, they very played down the Dexter mix-up, and the Zane Grey incident. Whereas in the book he is mistaken for an author of some fame, in the film he is simply assumed to be knowledgeable on novels as he is an author. It's a much lesser problem, and also much less humorous because of this.There are also some name changes Rollo becomes Holly (and never Buck Dexter), Cooler becomes Pepescu, and Winkler becomes Winkle. There's really no clear indication of why these changes have been made, with the possible exception of making the American a Hungarian. That fits the plot slightly better.There is some dispute over whether Carol Reed or Orson Welles directed, what with the weird camera angles that Welles is known for and Reed not.

These themes, used by Swedish director Ingmar Bergman in his film Fanny and Alexander not only make for a compelling movie but also offer insight into Swedish culture along with hints of autobiographical elements of Bergman life.Fanny and Alexander, made in 1982, was the last feature film directed by Bergman. The film was released twice; first as a 3-hour long feature and second as a 5-hour long feature, which was intended to be shown as a TV-movie. In the 5-hour version characters in the film are explored more in depth. For the sake of understanding my review, I felt it would be appropriate to note that my opinions of the film are based off the 3-hour long feature.Fanny and Alexander tells the story of a young boy, Alexander, and his family set in a Swedish town representing Uppsala, Sweden between 1907-09. Alexander's family, the Ekdahls, come from a wealthier background and are all gathering for Christmas Eve dinner. During a good first portion of the film we are introduced to a variety of the family members and exposed to their personal, and often troubled backgrounds. We also learn that Alexander's parents are involved with the local theatre. Soon thereafter Alexander's father dies of a stroke while rehearsing on stage for an upcoming play. Distraught from the loss of her husband, Alexander's mother, Emilie, finds comfort in the local bishop, and soon accepts his proposal for marriage. Emilie and the children then move in with the bishop. Quickly the children are forced by the bishop to give up their possessions and live under his strict, unforgiving, and at times, violent, rule. The family, longing for their past life, then becomes prisoners of the bishops house. Luckily, Emilie had been secretly in contact with her mother- in-law, Helena, and the Ekdahl family plans to intervene and save Alexander and his family. Without giving the rest of the film away, the ending explores Alexander's relationship with himself by questioning his faith and his hatred for the bishop.Faith is explored in the film the same way faith is viewed in Swedish culture- with skepticism. Alexander having encountered the ghost of his father and exploring his hatred for the bishop- a religious man- offer Alexander with a conflicted view of humanities goodness and its connection to a god. An example of this in the film is when Alexander meets Ismael. Through this interaction between the two characters Alexander confronts his inner self with the help of Ismael, who can be seen as the 'darker side' of Alexander. Alexander, through this connection, overcomes his fathers death and confronts his hatred for the bishop by imagining the bishops death. Bergman's own childhood comes into play with the use of a clock- used as a symbol of death or of a visit from a ghost. Faith is explored in a very self-oriented way that appears magical and surreal, while questioning human goodness.Man and women in the film is also another important theme in the movie and can be a peak into the taboo subject of 'Swedish Sin.' Men and women are shown throughout the film to be acting off the basic instincts of sexual desire. They first appear to be perfect citizens of society. However, they fall to temptation when the characters begin to lust after, and engage in behavior that 'proper' Swedish society tries to repress. For example, Alexanders uncle Carl's relationship with the nanny girl, May. Carl, who has a wife, runs off to engage in sexual activities with the nanny, which as a result, bares a child. Carl's wife seems to have no reservations against her husband for engaging in an affair. Another example is the abusive sexual relationship that Alexander's mother is put in. Though we don't actually see the acts, Emilie becomes pregnant with the bishops child even though she no longer loves him. She appears weak and bruised as the family lives longer with the bishop. This, among other instances in the film call into question the true nature of humanity and what roles men and women play in society.The artist in the film is Alexander. He is the one who creates and uses his imagination by making up stories, such as the time when he made up the story of how the bishop killed his former wife and children. The bishop tries to rid the artist from Alexander by punishing him, but is unable to do so. The use of a theatrical set in the Jew's household, and the puppets that inhabit it, also create a surreal and magical world that provide an appropriate context for Alexander to explore the question of faith during his confrontations with his father and Ismael. It is no wonder why Bergman, who was not only a playwright for theatre, but also heavily influenced by theatre for film, uses theatrical elements in Fanny and Alexander in order to express his themes. Bergman use of the 'magic lamp' in the film is also one of Bergman's favorite childhood memories, where it was common for him to make up stories with the 'magic lamp' pictures. The artist in the film enhances the context in which Alexander reflects personally on something as surreal as art- faith.Overall Fanny and Alexander was a great film, with an engaging storyline that is full of in- depth meaning that can be explored and interpreted in many ways. Between the relationships of faith, men and women, and the artist is society, Bergman offers a peak not only into his personal life, but also that of Swedish society and the relationship of faith in humanity.

One of his sons, Christian, revealed to the guests that Helge had sexually abused him and his twin sister when they were young, and that was the reason why his twin had committed suicide. The film realistically portrays contemporary social issues that occur in many western societies and exemplifies common ways that individuals deal or cope with them. Although The Celebration was Danish, it sends a powerful message to other nations, like the United States. A country's political views and actions shape ideas about topics such as immigration. Verbal, physical, sexual, and substance abuse are all factors that impact familial development. In that sense, this message becomes global. People are social actors, and their social environment shapes who they become. Danish society in the 1990's influenced the messages in this film, but I think it should be also be viewed by Americans to understand their own culture.Alcohol played a role in the film as a source of abuse as well as a source of escape. The entire group consumed alcohol at the party, and they appeared to consume more once everyone began feeling awkward after Christian's story. Christian seemed to have been using the mood-altering drug to manage or numb his bottled emotions. Michael was a perfect example of an alcohol user who became violent and verbally abusive, which we saw during his interactions with Helene's African-American boyfriend. Alcohol consumption is quite popular in Danish society, for in 1994, drawn from a sample of about 2500 males and 2500 females, only 3.2% of Danes 16 years of age and older abstained from alcohol (WHO). Although abstinence in the United States is much higher, statistics have shown high levels of binge drinking (WHO). Alcohol most likely influenced Helge's abusive actions when the children were young.Michael's way of dealing with being raised in a hostile environment was to create one of his own. His father was powerful and showed his power through verbal, physical, and sexual abuse. Michael learned how to be in control by mimicking his father's behavior. Helene's form of escape was to surround herself in a culturally diverse environment and be removed from her family setting. There were glimpses of anxiety as she puffed down cigarettes. Vinterberg strategically tilted the camera for a dysfunctional effect. The long takes, home-video camera, and dull lighting takes the viewer into the story as if they were there. Watching the film makes one feel awkward and uncomfortable because it is so realistic.Verbal and physical abuse targeted Helene's African-American boyfriend. In Buckser's Communities of Faith Sectarianism, Identity, and Social Change on a Danish Island (1996), he discussed that Danish identity has been challenged since they joined the European Union in 1972. The globalizing world brought in new people and ideals. One constant Danish trait that has survived has been their language, which could explain why people in the film were upset with Helene's boyfriend who continued to speak English.Immigration and globalization is also a domestic topic of debate in the United States. Although the United States does not have a concrete identity that dates back hundreds of years, there is still tension with immigrants. Both the United States and Denmark have had political parties that had agendas to refuse foreign peoples social rights and services. In the 1980's and 90's, the Yugoslavian Civil War brought many central European immigrants to Scandinavian countries. During that time, there was also a large influx of Muslim immigration. In the 1990's many immigrants, like the Muslims, lived in Muslim enclaves separate from Danish society (Assyrian International News Agency 2010). In 2005, George Bush and Homeland Security began the construction of a multi-billion dollar wall stretching across the Mexican and United States border. The wall was quite a controversial topic, but there were still many people who were supportive. The Danish Progress Party until in the 1990's stated that, refugees should not be integrated and only in exceptional cases be granted permanent residence. Access to Danish citizenship should be limited by a quota arrangement, and be given only to people with ability to care for themselves and with sufficient knowledge of Danish language and culture (Bjorklund and Anderson 1999). Both countries have dealt and are still dealing with controversy over immigration.Clearly, between alcohol abuse, hostile environment in the family, and tensions of immigration, we can see the similarities of Denmark and the United States of America. These are not just Danish issues. The Celebration displays these cultural problems in a harsh, yet effective manner. I love its honesty.Sources Assyrian International News Agency, 2010 http\/\/www.aina.org\/news\/20080718105208.htm Bjorklund, Tor and Jorgen Goul Anderson.

One of his sons, Christian, revealed to the guests that Helge had sexually abused him and his twin sister when they were young, and that was the reason why his twin had committed suicide. The film realistically portrays contemporary social issues that occur in many western societies and exemplifies common ways that individuals deal or cope with them. Although The Celebration was Danish, it sends a powerful message to other nations, like the United States. A country's political views and actions shape ideas about topics such as immigration. Verbal, physical, sexual, and substance abuse are all factors that impact familial development. In that sense, this message becomes global. People are social actors, and their social environment shapes who they become. Danish society in the 1990's influenced the messages in this film, but I think it should be also be viewed by Americans to understand their own culture.Alcohol played a role in the film as a source of abuse as well as a source of escape. The entire group consumed alcohol at the party, and they appeared to consume more once everyone began feeling awkward after Christian's story. Christian seemed to have been using the mood-altering drug to manage or numb his bottled emotions. Michael was a perfect example of an alcohol user who became violent and verbally abusive, which we saw during his interactions with Helene's African-American boyfriend. Alcohol consumption is quite popular in Danish society, for in 1994, drawn from a sample of about 2500 males and 2500 females, only 3.2% of Danes 16 years of age and older abstained from alcohol (WHO). Although abstinence in the United States is much higher, statistics have shown high levels of binge drinking (WHO). Alcohol most likely influenced Helge's abusive actions when the children were young.Michael's way of dealing with being raised in a hostile environment was to create one of his own. His father was powerful and showed his power through verbal, physical, and sexual abuse. Michael learned how to be in control by mimicking his father's behavior. Helene's form of escape was to surround herself in a culturally diverse environment and be removed from her family setting. There were glimpses of anxiety as she puffed down cigarettes. Vinterberg strategically tilted the camera for a dysfunctional effect. The long takes, home-video camera, and dull lighting takes the viewer into the story as if they were there. Watching the film makes one feel awkward and uncomfortable because it is so realistic.Verbal and physical abuse targeted Helene's African-American boyfriend. In Buckser's Communities of Faith Sectarianism, Identity, and Social Change on a Danish Island (1996), he discussed that Danish identity has been challenged since they joined the European Union in 1972. The globalizing world brought in new people and ideals. One constant Danish trait that has survived has been their language, which could explain why people in the film were upset with Helene's boyfriend who continued to speak English.Immigration and globalization is also a domestic topic of debate in the United States.

(The actual anniversary had taken place in August 1979, not long before we went up). The joke was that those attending the reunion were all middle-class professional types, smartly dressed in lounge suits with well-trimmed short hair. This poster exemplified the way in which my generation saw the baby boomers, twentysomething hippies turned thirtysomething yuppies. Those who still retained their hippie idealism were mercilessly derided as being at least ten years behind the times. (And derided not only by Cambridge students but also by the likes of B. A. Robertson, in his satirical song Kool in the Kaftan). The Big Chill takes a rather more charitable look at the problems facing those idealists from the 1960s who tried to retain their idealism during the conservative Reagan years of the early 1980s. It features a group of old college friends from the University of Michigan who are reunited after fifteen years. The event which reunites them is the death of Alex, one of the group, who committed suicide while staying at the home of his friends Harold and Sarah. An impromptu reunion occurs as the old friends gather for Alex's funeral. The precise reasons why Alex killed himself are not spelled out- he did not leave a suicide note- but as the movie progresses we realise that he had become disillusioned with the course his life had taken. (He was a brilliant scientist, but had dropped out of the academic life to become a social worker). His friends also come to realise this, and the realisation prompts them to consider the paths their own lives have taken. Most of the group were involved in the counterculture of the 1960s and the peace movement or other forms of radical politics, but most are now living much more conservative, middle-class lifestyles. Harold is a business executive and his wife Sarah a doctor; they live in an elegant antebellum home in the South. Sam, a one-time radical, has now become a Hollywood actor closely based upon Tom Selleck, down to the moustache. (While watching the film I assumed that Selleck himself was playing the part; it was only when I saw the cast-list that I realised it was actually Tom Berenger). Karen is also now living an affluent lifestyle but is feeling dissatisfied with her husband Richard (who was not one of the college group). Michael, once a radical journalist, now works for the apolitical, celebrity-obsessed People Magazine. Nick, a Vietnam War veteran, has now become a drug dealer. Apart from their friend's suicide, the question which haunts the group is what became of their youthful idealism? Contrary to what one might have expected, the film does not take a straightforward radicalism good, conservatism bad line. A key scene comes when Nick nearly gets himself arrested by badmouthing the local policeman. Harold, a personal friend of the officer, manages to smooth things out, but then berates Nick for his rudeness and stupidity. To Nick, who still subscribes to the sixties idea that all cops are pigs , this may seem like a sellout to the enemy, but I suspect that most of the audience will side with Harold who realises that some of his contemporaries have difficulty in distinguishing between idealism and childishness. The Big Chill has something in common with another movie from the early eighties, Barry Levinson's Diner from 1981, which also deals with a reunion of a group of former classmates, although that film is a period piece set in 1959 and the characters are rather younger, being in their twenties rather than their thirties. What the two films have in common is that both are excellent examples of ensemble acting.This was the second film of its director Lawrence Kasdan (his first was the very different neo-noir thriller Body Heat) and it starred a number of actors, such as William Hurt and Kevin Kline, who were to become regulars in Kasdan's movies. , (Kevin Costner, originally cast as Alex, was edited out of the final version, but also went on to become a Kasdan regular). There are too may good performances to list them all, but special mentions must go to Kline as Harold, Glenn Close as Sarah and Meg Tilly as Alex's strange, unworldly younger girlfriend Chloe. One question much discussed on this board is whether the film is dated. Leaving aside trivial questions of fashion (even in the eighties Tom Berenger's hairstyle must have looked very seventies), I think that it is dated, but only in the narrow, limited sense that it deals with cultural phenomena such as the sixties counterculture which were very much of their own era. In a wider sense it is not dated because it deals with timeless issues such as love, friendship and the challenge of staying true to one's youthful ideals in later life. (Another eighties film on this theme, although in my view a less successful one, is Fred Schepisi's Plenty). I felt that the film was occasionally slow-moving, with too great an emphasis on talk over action. I also wondered whether it might not have been improved by keeping Costner's scenes to allow us to see what sort of a person Alex was and why his death had such a traumatic impact on his friends. Overall, however, I felt that it was a very watchable film, and often a moving one- one that could be watched for pleasure not only by those who are too young to remember the sixties but even those who are too young to remember the eighties. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"5 March 2010","score":"4 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" When I was a student at Cambridge in the early eighties, shortly before The Big Chill came out, a friend of mine had a poster on his wall entitled Woodstock Tenth Anniversary Reunion.

(The actual anniversary had taken place in August 1979, not long before we went up). The joke was that those attending the reunion were all middle-class professional types, smartly dressed in lounge suits with well-trimmed short hair. This poster exemplified the way in which my generation saw the baby boomers, twentysomething hippies turned thirtysomething yuppies. Those who still retained their hippie idealism were mercilessly derided as being at least ten years behind the times. (And derided not only by Cambridge students but also by the likes of B. A. Robertson, in his satirical song Kool in the Kaftan). The Big Chill takes a rather more charitable look at the problems facing those idealists from the 1960s who tried to retain their idealism during the conservative Reagan years of the early 1980s. It features a group of old college friends from the University of Michigan who are reunited after fifteen years. The event which reunites them is the death of Alex, one of the group, who committed suicide while staying at the home of his friends Harold and Sarah. An impromptu reunion occurs as the old friends gather for Alex's funeral. The precise reasons why Alex killed himself are not spelled out- he did not leave a suicide note- but as the movie progresses we realise that he had become disillusioned with the course his life had taken. (He was a brilliant scientist, but had dropped out of the academic life to become a social worker). His friends also come to realise this, and the realisation prompts them to consider the paths their own lives have taken. Most of the group were involved in the counterculture of the 1960s and the peace movement or other forms of radical politics, but most are now living much more conservative, middle-class lifestyles. Harold is a business executive and his wife Sarah a doctor; they live in an elegant antebellum home in the South. Sam, a one-time radical, has now become a Hollywood actor closely based upon Tom Selleck, down to the moustache. (While watching the film I assumed that Selleck himself was playing the part; it was only when I saw the cast-list that I realised it was actually Tom Berenger). Karen is also now living an affluent lifestyle but is feeling dissatisfied with her husband Richard (who was not one of the college group). Michael, once a radical journalist, now works for the apolitical, celebrity-obsessed People Magazine. Nick, a Vietnam War veteran, has now become a drug dealer. Apart from their friend's suicide, the question which haunts the group is what became of their youthful idealism? Contrary to what one might have expected, the film does not take a straightforward radicalism good, conservatism bad line. A key scene comes when Nick nearly gets himself arrested by badmouthing the local policeman. Harold, a personal friend of the officer, manages to smooth things out, but then berates Nick for his rudeness and stupidity. To Nick, who still subscribes to the sixties idea that all cops are pigs , this may seem like a sellout to the enemy, but I suspect that most of the audience will side with Harold who realises that some of his contemporaries have difficulty in distinguishing between idealism and childishness. The Big Chill has something in common with another movie from the early eighties, Barry Levinson's Diner from 1981, which also deals with a reunion of a group of former classmates, although that film is a period piece set in 1959 and the characters are rather younger, being in their twenties rather than their thirties. What the two films have in common is that both are excellent examples of ensemble acting.This was the second film of its director Lawrence Kasdan (his first was the very different neo-noir thriller Body Heat) and it starred a number of actors, such as William Hurt and Kevin Kline, who were to become regulars in Kasdan's movies. , (Kevin Costner, originally cast as Alex, was edited out of the final version, but also went on to become a Kasdan regular). There are too may good performances to list them all, but special mentions must go to Kline as Harold, Glenn Close as Sarah and Meg Tilly as Alex's strange, unworldly younger girlfriend Chloe. One question much discussed on this board is whether the film is dated. Leaving aside trivial questions of fashion (even in the eighties Tom Berenger's hairstyle must have looked very seventies), I think that it is dated, but only in the narrow, limited sense that it deals with cultural phenomena such as the sixties counterculture which were very much of their own era. In a wider sense it is not dated because it deals with timeless issues such as love, friendship and the challenge of staying true to one's youthful ideals in later life. (Another eighties film on this theme, although in my view a less successful one, is Fred Schepisi's Plenty). I felt that the film was occasionally slow-moving, with too great an emphasis on talk over action. I also wondered whether it might not have been improved by keeping Costner's scenes to allow us to see what sort of a person Alex was and why his death had such a traumatic impact on his friends. Overall, however, I felt that it was a very watchable film, and often a moving one- one that could be watched for pleasure not only by those who are too young to remember the sixties but even those who are too young to remember the eighties. 7\/10 ","genre":"Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"5 March 2010","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" After viewing the movie The Idiots, by Lars Von Trier, I found that there were many themes evident in the movie as well as many dogma 95 techniques used as well. The Idiots was an almost documentary-like film about a group of individuals that all were staying in Stoffer's uncles house that he was supposed to be trying to sell. Instead of selling the house he invited over some of his friends and they all decided to find their inner idiot by spassing, also known as acting disabled or more blatantly&#x85; retarded. They do this both in public and in Stoffer's house and began to cross the line or make the viewers feel uncomfortable after the scene in the factory. Karen, who we are introduced to in the restaurant in the first scene, begins to find her inner idiot after staying at the house for two weeks and is actually the only one to act like an idiot in front of her family at the end of the movie, which was very surprising to me and I'm sure many other people that viewed this film. Some of the themes I found in this film were as follows public dysfunction, community, confrontation with inner self, freedom, and retardation. Public dysfunction I found to be the main theme due to the fact that the majority of the movie was based around the group of characters acting retarded in public. Next there was a sense of community on the house and when they performed their stunts or acts in public. Confrontation with inner self was another prevalent theme in the film, because the characters were all on a mission to find their inner idiot. As the characters tried finding their inner selves, this brought up the theme of freedom and the ability to act and say what the wanted too throughout the film. The last theme was retardation, which the film is built around as they are acting retarded both in public and at Stoffer's uncle's house. The key characters in the film were Stoffer, Karen, Susanne, Katrine, Henrik, Axel, Jeppe, and Josephine. Next I am going to talk about the cinematic techniques utilized throughout the film. Since this is considered a Danish Dogma 95 film, there are certain guidelines and rules that Von Trier had to follow. The most noticeable of the techniques was definitely the usage of hand held cameras. The scene that comes to mind when you can really see this is when they are throwing a spass birthday party for Stoffer and they are all running naked in the yard. Also another scene where it is easy to tell that the cameras are hand held is in the factory when the van is leaving. Each step the factory tour guide takes, the camera bounces along with him. Another prevalent theme is the fact that there was never any music being played in the background of the film. Also, we never saw any weapons or murder because it would have had to have been real. Some background information on the film I found was that the movie takes place in Copenhagen, which is the birthplace of Von Trier. This may be the case because he is afraid of flying and is forced to drive to wherever a movie is being filmed. Also, Von Trier's parents were nudists, so perhaps he was a fan of nudity in films because he was so accustomed to being around naked people and was very comfortable with filming and incorporating nudity into his films. The last piece of background information I found was that this film was written in four days, which on one hand is incredible, but at the same time in my opinion could be why I did not take a liking to the movie at all. Lastly, I am going to talk about my personal opinion about the movie. To begin, I will say that this was one of those movies that I will never set aside two hours to watch ever again. The beginning of the movie was funny up until right after the factory. After the factory scene I felt that the movie was very repetitive and I was having a lot of trouble sitting in my seat. There were a few scenes that were painful to sit through and made me uncomfortable such as the scene where they were hanging out with actual handicapped people and spassing with them, which in my opinion, crossed any ethical lines that had not already been crossed in the film. To continue, I can see why films like these are not available or screened in the United States, because the film was very offensive and emotionally traumatizing. Lastly, however, I thought the acting was very good and I was impressed with how the actors were able to keep their composer and not laugh while spassing in public. In conclusion, the film The Idiots was a unique film with an interesting plot, but I would never watch the movie again in the future. If I had to recommend the movie to another individual, I would say that it is a movie you can watch once, but will probably never watch again.

Sure, we often see a woman leaving her bad boyfriend for someone better... but this was a bit sillier. And really, I'm not sure what either man saw in her. But that's a whole other situation.

The lawyer also presses Harry to marry Billie on the grounds that a wife cannot testify against her husband. Harry becomes disgusted with Billie's ignorance and lack of manners and hires a tutor for her, journalist Paul Verrall (William Holden).Judy Holliday ended up winning the Best Actress Oscar, which may not be a surprise if you know she also starred as Billie in the stage production -- she had been playing the same role many times! Interestingly, around the time of Born Yesterday, she was found linked to communism and became blacklisted from television and radio for three years. Mysterious! According to Paul Verrall in the film, the whole history of the world is the selfish versus the unselfish. I simply don't see how he's come to that conclusion. I understand the selfish fighting, but often aren't those fighting the selfish those who want something that the other has? Where is the unselfish side?

Unforgetful performance by Edward Norton(Derek).I think this is his best performance up to date.He has proved how dedicated he is to his acting & truly this role deserved an Oscar. Edward Furlong(Doris) also plays a fantastic role.Lending deep emotions in to the role.This movie will make you feel that in the past if you have wasted your years for no good reasons then please don't waste it now.Becasuse Hate is Baggage.Love can overcome all odds.Some scenes in the movie will make you feel why you don't get along with your brother that well.Hopefully you can learn and see for yourself. Specially the scene in which Derek takes a bath & the movie takes you back to his childhood days playing side by side with your brother.This will cut you deep.You will feel the pain. The ending is very good & unpredictable.Soundtrack is fabulous.Will make you feel why you wasted so many good years of your life. Truly a masterpiece!!!Best movie of the 1990's.

And the trouble lies in the fact that the successful duo, Lamont and Lakewood, have a woman (Jean Hagen) whose voice is more or less awful. How can they continue to be successful and open their mouths? I had some concerns with this film. Gene Kelly gets all the credit, but his little buddy is clearly the better dancer, especially during his long comedy scene. Sure, Kelly has more talking time, but the other guy gets the short end of the stick (so much so that I cannot even recall his name). Also, Lena's voice is made out to be bad, but it really wasn't that awful. Judy Holliday has roughly the same voice in Born Yesterday and no one complains. I'm not sure why this is called Singin' in the Rain, as that's just one scene... it could just as easily have been called The Dueling Cavalier. Oh well.The humor of converting silents to talkies is pretty great, more or less the highlight of the film. The strategic use of hidden microphones, and how the sound can get out of sync. The film as a whole is good and has some nice dance sequences if that's what you're into, but this part was really want made it memorable. This will go down as one of the greatest films in MGM history, and someday maybe it will get a retroactive Best Picture Oscar.

It comes across as fearless, and you wonder just how it got the okay to tell as much truth as it does. It slams the tobacco industry and CBS Corporation equally (though CBS News, as such, rises above). It creates a fluid, fast, intelligible, and moving story involving several key players. And it avoids sentiment, cliché, and shock, which is sort of amazing for a Hollywood film right there.Add three amazing, central performances by men who take on their roles as if they needed to for their lives. First is Al Pacino, who often plays the righteous and indignant voice of justice, and he plays it with more justice here than ever. Then there is Russell Crowe, playing the insider himself, a tobacco industry chemist who spills the beans about the lies in the industry, and with real psychological subtlety. And then, in more of a surprise, Christopher Plummer plays one of Pacino's counterparts with perfect pitch.Anthony Mann deserves a huge hand for his role pulling this together. He has a deft touch. He handles big material (spectacular stuff, really) with a steady beat of conviction, as if the point is not drama, but resolution. The music is superb, making clear that this is of course still a drama, and the editing, easily overlooked, creates a relentless but not distracting pace, leaving little things hanging just enough to keep us in suspense without obscuring the narrative.I sound breathless in praise, and I suppose my one reservation is that the movie, since it is based on known facts (and uses real names throughout), lacks imagination. That's a bizarre comment, and not a complaint, exactly, but there is a sense when all is done that it was already known from the start. Getting there was amazing, but the result is a heightened version of what we know and see all the time in the news and in the corporate worlds. And sometimes elements are repeated too often (the video tape), so you can see a trimmed down version having even more impact.But let me go back to being breathless. This is an overlooked, wonderful movie. That it holds interest so well after a decade is only proof that it might continue to work as a movie, as a drama, long after the events are in textbooks, and CBS is bought up by someone else. And so the world turns. Check this out. You won't be disappointed.
