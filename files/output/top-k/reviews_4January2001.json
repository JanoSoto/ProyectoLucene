Despite its falseness, the shot of Mordred spearing Arthur against a bloody sunset is still one of my lasting impressions of film history. I would agree with John Boorman himself that the direction and acting have some small shortcomings, but that the enchanting qualities of the myth override any physical elements of the movie itself. This is a case where the story is truly greater than its tellers, just the way it should be.

Created in the 1930's, the story of a being with extraordinary abilities who also exists as a mild mannered reporter, works because it requires a certain amount of imagination. The film-makers of SUPERMAN remembered this.  Here is a movie which, for once, is not afraid of its comic book origins. Whereas a film like BATMAN AND ROBIN exhibited none of the original comic's darkness and was quite different, SUPERMAN remains completely true to its inspiration. And it's unbelievably entertaining because of that. It captures the sense of absolute wonder and awe which filled the comic book and translates it to the screen perfectly. It works precisely because it avoids any of the traps which plague other comic book movie adaptations.When adapting comic books to the screen, the writer must first consider the audience. First off, they must deliver a back story which introduces the character(s) and their plight(s). The second task is in creating a story which is interesting enough to appeal to both fans and non-fans. SUPERMAN already had the advantage of having a story which is well known to just about everybody. And if not, the movie certainly makes the legend clear and brings everybody up to speed. Perhaps the fact that it was co-written by Mario Puzo (THE GODFATHER) doesn't hurt. By successfully combining parts of the comic's mythology as well as the human aspects, writers Mario Puzo, David and Leslie Newman, and Robert Towne have fashioned a marvellously fun movie. Although the opening sequence is rather long, it does a commendable job of setting up what is to follow. I enjoyed the way we got to witness Superman's life evolving.The romantic aspects of the screenplay are what really power the movie, though. This is most apparent during the climax where we see the full extent of Superman's deep affection for Lois, to the point where he disobeys his father's direct orders. The screenplay also pays tribute to the various aspects of the Superman legend (one scene has the teenage Superman outrunning a train). It's little bits of continuity like this that help to make SUPERMAN the classic that it is.The story begins on the planet Krypton, as Jor-El (Marlon Brando) sentences three criminals (who figure prominently in SUPERMAN II) before the Krytonian Council. After this, Jor-El warns the planet's leaders of the impending destruction which is to come. He then sends his infant son, Kal-El, to Earth to ensure his safety. During the voyage, Kal-El learns of his father's vast knowledge. His ship eventually lands in the country where Kal-El is adopted by an older couple, the Kents (Glenn Ford and Phyllis Baxter).Several years pass and Clark Kent (Jeff East) is now a teenager. He learns of his amazing abilities and occasionally shows them off. However, after tragedy strikes his adopted family, he leaves the countryside and journeys to the Fortress of Solitude. There he learns of his true identity and purpose. He spends several more years learning of Earth's knowledge and history. He is now Superman.He conceals his secret identity by posing as Clark Kent, a mild mannered reporter at the Daily Planet. There he meets Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) and instantly falls in love with her. Meanwhile, self proclaimed criminal mastermind Lex Luthor is planning a scheme which will make him the richest person alive. His diabolical plan involves detonation of nuclear warheads upon the San Adreas Fault, which will cause California to crumble and will kill millions of people.Watching the film, one can easily see why Christopher Reeve is the perfect choice to play the Man of Steel. He perfectly embodies the qualities that people have come to associate with Superman, and does a convincing job of portraying both Superman and Clark Kent.Margot Kidder is very likeable as Lois Lane. Reeve and Kidder both create a subtle and more importantly, believable relationship. One which never feels contrived and stupid. Their chemistry involves what is said and what is not (thus explaining the film's love song Can You Read My Mind). The best thing about the relationship is that it doesn't exist merely as a gratuitous plot device but rather as an integral part of the main story.Gene Hackman manages to make Lex Luthor an engaging villain. Although if the movie has one flaw (and trust me, there are very few) it is that he is never quite threatening. Still, the way in which the screenplay is structured, the character is an ego-maniac and Hackman makes him a lot of fun to watch. Appearing as Luthor's bumbling sidekick, Ned Beatty is amusing but isn't given much screen time. Valerie Perrine is also decent but suffers from the same problem.As the teenage Superman, Jeff East does a fine job with his smaller role.Marlon Brando contributes a decent but unspectacular performance in his cameo role as Jor-El. It's questionable whether he deserved top billing or the amount of money he received($4 million) for his ten minutes on screen.SUPERMAN also has a director who has consistently made entertaining movies since this one. Richard Donner gives the film a grand scope all its own. More importantly, he takes the story seriously and treats it with great reverence. He reveals himself to be a master at handling the quieter moments just as well as the bigger ones. Indeed, there are some touching moments. The scene in which the young Superman says goodbye to his foster mother, and the climax are both very well shot and give even more depth to the overall proceedings.Besides the acting and directing, it also boasts a fantastic score. John Williams contributes one his most memorable themes, greatly enhancing certain scenes in the movie, especially the Superman-Lois flying sequence (set to the love song Can You Read My Mind).SUPERMAN does has a few plot holes, such as Lois not realizing that Superman and Clark Kent are actually the same person (when it's quite obvious). But like a comic book, we are more than willing to overlook them. After all, suspension of disbelief is one of the most popular devices used in comic books. It's why people read them anyway. They're a form of escape, just like movies.The special effects are generally good ,considering their age, although some of them (the flying scenes) do look dated. Although it has a long running time, SUPERMAN is never boring. Unlike most other comic book movies, it actually attempts to tell a story instead of placing an emphasis on special effects to carry the movie. And this is one of the film's best qualities.

So I went with Linda to see the movie and there I was. For the duration of the movie, I was so absorbed by the story and how good Denzel Washington played in there. He was a truly in his acting. He is a real actor. The way he has to suffer on that movie has touch me deeply. He is so pure on his roll that I almost forgot that he was only an actor who play the roll of Hurricane.

It was a little bit odd to see Gillian Anderson in a role other than stone-cold Scully, but while odd, it was very refreshing at the same time. Sean Connery and Gena Rowlands were also very good in their roles, and they made Hannah and Paul believable as an aged(not old) married couple.The most confusing part of the movie was Dennis Quaid's characters, who only made some sense at the end. Frankly, I could have done without his part of the story, if not, then at least with more insight into Hugh as Hugh, rather than somebody else.While I do my part in the fight for AIDS, and the scenes between Mark and Meredith were perfection in the reconciliation between a mother and her dying gay son, I felt that maybe Carroll pushed the issue of AIDS  is a hurtful disease too far when he also gave Keenan HIV.All in all, it took quite some time to really get into the movie, but it did make me do some deep thinking about love, life, and yada yada...however, because I enjoyed the movie even more when I turned on the closed-captioning, maybe the story would have faired better as a book, even though I enjoyed the movie very much.
