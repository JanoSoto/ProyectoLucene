Im going to be honest OK, I only went to see this because it was in the Top 250 IMDb movies. I went totally expecting to hate this movie because it was black and white. I'm amazed to say that it's AWESOME! While not an action picture there's plenty of action and drama. You've gotta see it. It's very inspiring, believe it or not this is a real samurai movie. It just made me appreciate freedom and love even more.Now I know why Seven Samurai is usually regarded as one of the greatest films ever made and is also one of a select few Japanese films to become widely known in the West, and is the subject of both popular and critical acclaim; it consistently ranks in the top ten movies on the IMDb Top 250 List and was voted onto Sight & Sound's list of the ten greatest films of all time in 1982 and 1992, and it remains on the director's top ten films in the 2002 poll. Sorry for my ignorance.This movies in now one of my favorites of all times!!!!!
