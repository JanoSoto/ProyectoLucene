As a popcorn movie it is quite good, although the movie is maybe a bit too long, for an action movie that is, the audience receives what it is looking and waiting for and visually the movie is quite nice indeed. Just as a action \/ adventure \/ fantasy movie I would give it a 7.5 \/ 10 maybe closer to 8 even, but it's not something that would blow my mind, all this has been seen in countless other movies, maybe in different form, in different surroundings, but still nothing ground breaking.The movie as a movieThis is where it hit's thin ice. Character's are very shallow, their motives and their personalities are left in the dark (other that can be shown in fights) eg. Frodo run's into Merry & Pippin in some field, and so they decide to follow Frodo, albeit they have no idea where they are going and why, had the movie established that they were good friends before it had been a lot easier to understand. Story is driven forward with a really fast pace (after Frodo leaves Shire that is) and unfortunately it is done with the expence of the story, all emphasis is given to action, action and more action. The characters are as basic as movie characters go, you got the comic relief (Merry & Pippin) the unbeatable warrior (Aragorn) the turncoat (Boromir) and so forth, and since the movie had to be modernized you also need the femme fatale (Arwen) and still this would be tolerable IF the characters were something more than a aid that just runs the movie forward. One other major problem is that the movie is pre chewed nothing is left to the viewer, the director takes the easy way out and so underestimates the viewers badly, I think it's rather sad really. So what does the movie leave you with ? well basicly your typical action adventure that is set in fantasy land. It's a typical hollywood production that emphasis on glitter rather than substance. As a movie I would rate it about 6 \/ 10The movie as a adaptation of Tolkien's workWell, what can I say ? basicly it takes just the basic storyline and forget's everything else, it's so horribly different from the book that it makes me cringe in terror. Those who disagree with me should really read the book's ... Peter Jackson is surely entitled to his vision but he shouldn't say that the movie is faithfull, since it is not. Jackson took the easy way to make this movie, he forgot about the soul of the book and made a action movie instead. Timeline is totally wrong, parts are cut out (like Bombadil) parts are added (like Arwen) since it needs to be modern I have read several review's here that say that the books needed to be modernized, may I ask why ? dont see a reason personally. I am not going to start to list everything that is changed, as I would need several pages more room, I am sure that if you want you can find places in internet that list the changes. As a Tolkien adaptation my rate is 3 \/ 10Bottomline is that while lotr is quite enjoyable and should be seen if this genre appeals to you it's not that special, when Jackson made the movie he tried to target as broad audience as possible and so had to seriously alter the books in order to make it more appealing.

As we mature, we are at some point confronted with the realization-- some sooner, some later-- that age and experience do not necessarily equate to satisfaction and personal identity in our lives, the two things we are all, though perhaps subconsciously, striving to attain.  But it's an elusive butterfly we're chasing; and at a certain age, the lack of fulfillment in one's life may be dismissed out-of-hand by some as a midlife crisis in a feeble attempt to justify certain actions or attitudes.  Attaching such a label to it, however, is merely simplifying a state of being that seems to be perpetually misunderstood, and we resort to using psychological ploys on ourselves in order to rationalize away behavior that is often unacceptable in the cold light of reason and morality.  This, of course, is not a unique situation, but an inevitable step one takes upon reaching an age at which the awareness of mortality begins to set in, which is something we all have to deal with in our own way, in our own time.  And it's an issue that lies allegorically at the heart of director Ang Lee's pensive, insightful drama, `The Ice Storm,' in which we discover that-- more often than not-- the adult we become is nothing more than an extension of the adolescent; we may shed the skin of youth, but the awkward confusion and uncertainty remains, albeit manifested in different ways, to which for awhile we may respond in opposition even to our own conscience, creating a double standard in our lives which only serves to exacerbate the confusion and unhappiness, leaving us alone to face the cold and frozen landscapes of our own soul.\tWorking from an insightful and intelligent screenplay by James Schamus (who also wrote Lee's `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' and `Eat Drink Man Woman,' among others), Lee has crafted and delivered a lyrical and poetic-- though somewhat dark-- film that tells the story of two neighboring families living in Connecticut in the early &#145;70s  Ben and Elena Hood (Kevin Kline and Joan Allen) and their children, Paul (Tobey Maguire) and Wendy (Christina Ricci); and Jim and Janey Carver (Jamey Sheridan and Sigourney Weaver) and their children, Mikey (Elijah Wood) and Sandy (Adam Hann-Byrd).  And it's a story to which many will be able to relate on a very personal, individual level, as it reflects an issue common to us all-- that of trying to make a tangible connection with someone or something in our life that we can hold on to and take comfort in.  Ben and Elena have grown apart; she has distanced herself emotionally and sexually from Ben, and unfulfilled, she longs again for the freedom of her spent youth, while Ben seeks solace in an emotionally vapid but physically satisfying relationship with another woman.  Jim, who spends much of his time on the road, has become completely disconnected from his entire family; his children are apathetic to his very presence, and Janey exists in a constant state of promiscuous numbness, yet cold and indifferent to her own husband.  \tThe Hood and Carver children, meanwhile, are suffering the pains of adolescence and trying to figure out the world in which they live, exploring their feelings with and for one another and attempting to understand the whys and wherefores of it all.  And to whom can they turn for guidance in an era that's giving them Nixon and Watergate, new age spiritualism and self-absorbed parents who teach one thing and do another? \tThe story unfolds through the eyes of sixteen-year-old Paul, whose meditations on the literal and figurative ice storm that descends upon the two families over a long Thanksgiving weekend forms the narrative of the film.  And it's through Paul's observations that Lee so subtly and effectively presents his metaphor, in which he captures the beauty, as well as the ugliness, that inexplicably coexists within and which surrounds the turbulence and turmoil of the Hood's and Carver's world, which is ultimately visited by tragedy as their drama proceeds to it's inevitable climax.  It's sensitive material that will undoubtedly touch a nerve with many in the audience, and Lee takes great care to present it accordingly, with a studied finesse that makes it an emotionally involving and thoroughly engrossing drama.\tLee also knows how to get the best out of his actors, and there are a number of outstanding and memorable performances in this film, beginning with that of Kevin Kline.  Kline does comedy well, but he does drama even better, as he proves here with his portrayal of Ben.  The final scene of the film, in fact, belongs to Kline, as it is here that we discover the true nature of the man he is in his heart of hearts.  It's a superb piece of acting, and one of the real strengths of the film.\tJoan Allen also turns in a strong performance through which she reveals the insufferable inner conflict that so affects Elena's life, and especially her relationship with Ben.  And it's in Allen's character, more than any of the others, that we see how fine the line is between the adult and the adolescent.  It is not unusual to find a bit of the mother in the daughter; but Allen shows us through Elena just how much of the daughter is actually in the mother, which underscores one of the basic tenets of the film.  It's a performance that should've earned Allen an Oscar nomination at the very least.\tAlso turning in performances that demand special attention are Maguire, Ricci, Wood and especially Jamey Sheridan, whose portrayal of Jim is one of his best-- it's believable, and totally honest.  Penetrating and incisive, `The Ice Storm' is remarkably poignant and absorbing; without question, it's one of Lee's finest films.  10\/10.  \t\t\t\t     \t\t\t  \t     ","genre":null},{"date":"18 March 2002","score":"93 out of 113 people found the following review useful","review":"  \tThe difference between adolescence and adulthood can be defined in terms of years or age, but when it comes right down to it, the only real difference is in the experiences the added years provide.

It's a performance that should've earned Allen an Oscar nomination at the very least.\tAlso turning in performances that demand special attention are Maguire, Ricci, Wood and especially Jamey Sheridan, whose portrayal of Jim is one of his best-- it's believable, and totally honest.  Penetrating and incisive, `The Ice Storm' is remarkably poignant and absorbing; without question, it's one of Lee's finest films.  10\/10.  \t\t\t\t     \t\t\t  \t     ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"18 March 2002","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  As we all know, the old TV series movie adaptation as received some contradictory reviews.

I love it. I can see where people would like to compare the two and say which one is better. It's hard not to. Looks like I'm going to do it as well.The plot of the first seemed much stronger. It flowed nicely and you didn't wonder about anything really, you knew what was going on. Brandon was an amazing fighter, and the villain was definitely convincing and evil. In the second the visuals were much much better, I loved the art and Sarah's apartment was especially beautiful. Another different but pleasing aspect was that there was more hand to hand street fighting (no real technique, but passion was behind it,) and Vincent Perez is one of my favorite actors. In the films I have seen him in, his presence is always felt. He can be very charming and predatory, he played a vampire for instance, very convincingly in my opinion . Overall he is cultured, beautiful, emotional, and intelligent. (He is European and was educated in France, he has that foreign mystique.) There is one part that come to mind when I think of him.(*spoiler*) Ashe moves in to kill one of his enemies, in a very interesting way. The man had been watching a peep show that you need tokens for, when his time is up the shade goes down. He scrambles to feed more tokens, and when the shade comes back up, Ashe is sitting there instead of the girl. He repeats the words of the peep show girl, Do you want me?...Baby? Incredibly sexy and evil!!*Spoilers* The differences I see in the movies are what makes them good in their own ways. Eric was cruelly assaulted along with his love. He came back with a mission, his grieving was brief because he had a job to do. He seemed more supernatural than human much of the time, and that was good in that movie. He came off as an invincible, untouchable avenging angel. Eric came back, did what he had to do, went back to the afterlife. I couldn't identify with someone that seemed not of this world.Ashe displayed all his pain and anguish, he was confused and more like you would expect a human being to act, coming back from the dead, pretty much remembering death like it had just occurred. In addition, the reason he and his son died had a little more believability. Seems realistic that if you live in the bad part of town and witness a crime, you might not live to tell about it. All in all I have to admit I enjoyed this movie more because of Ashe's humanity.Ashe comes back, figures out what he has to do and takes revenge for himself and his son. But finds himself unsure of whether he wants to be taken from the world again. Some of this seems to stem from a desire to stay around for Sarah, the possible romance is heartbreaking. Examples of his humanity are his emotions, they are more open and he grieves angrily and sobs over his loss, whereas Eric holds it in to effectively get the job done. Ashe has very human weaknesses, and that is what eventually leads to his near downfall. This makes him more likeable, and I cried for him. That's why I'm more partial to this one, it could make me cry so much.So both movies in my opinion are awesome.

The film follows a whiny sloth (Leguizamo) a disgruntled mammoth (Romano) and an anti-heroic Sabretooth (Leary) on a quest to reunite a human baby with his family. Truth be told, this is ground that has been covered before with animated films (most recently, in Monsters Inc., Disney\/Pixars latest foray into CG-animation). In fact, much of the story elements and characters in this film are a tad trite, but this film isnt about material, its all about the execution. And the execution, helmed by director Chris Wedge, is flawless. Wedge has a sense of timing that most directors would kill for, with visual gags and one-liners hitting the audience in rapid succession not seen since Chuck Jones' heyday. not only is the comedy wonderful, but so is the design. With a few exceptions (the goofy rhinoceri-type creatures, for one) the film delivers visually astounding images in a detailed, yet intentionally cartoony style unlike anything the medium has presented viewers with since its creation. All in all, this film is exceptional family entertainment of the breed Disney has not produced since The Lion King. it isnt flawless entertainment, but it is the second great animated comedy of the twenty-first century (following Shrek, of course ). So, bottom line, go for the Star Wars trailer, stay for the opening sequence (the funniest I have ever seen), then just try to walk away from some classic family entertainment which any fan of the cel-animation greats will love... you won't be able to! It really is riotously funny.

","genre":null},{"date":"18 March 2002","score":"","review":"  Chris Wedge's Ice Age is the first CG-animated film out of 20th Century Fox, and it certainly is a brilliant maiden voyage for the studio. The film follows a whiny sloth (Leguizamo) a disgruntled mammoth (Romano) and an anti-heroic Sabretooth (Leary) on a quest to reunite a human baby with his family. Truth be told, this is ground that has been covered before with animated films (most recently, in Monsters Inc., Disney\/Pixars latest foray into CG-animation). In fact, much of the story elements and characters in this film are a tad trite, but this film isnt about material, its all about the execution. And the execution, helmed by director Chris Wedge, is flawless.

If that were true, then that would infer that about half the people who saw it loved it and the other half hated it. Well, if the talkbacks and the fact that it's already in the top ten all-time worldwide are any indicators, then it's probably more like 50 % loved it, 30-40 % thought it was OK or good, and then there is the vocal 10% club that detest this movie. I, for one, loved this movie but do not feel anger towards those who hate it because they are not going to change things. In fact I feel sorry for these people almost to a point of pity and embarrassment for them. I teach 4th graders and I know ten year olds who understood this movie better than those who complain of its length or complexity. Another misconception of this movie is that Peter Jackson did not take a risk in taking on this project. This could not be further from the truth as people have talked about doing this movie for decades but everyone has balked at it thinking it would be impossible. The Beatles approached Stanley Kubrick about doing it thirty years ago, but he said it would be too hard to do. People have described Memento, Beautiful Mind, and Moulin Rouge as much bigger risks- these are all wonderful movies, but to not describe a movie that no one has dared to touch in fifty years as a risk is ludicrous. In fact, most studios wanted to cut it to two movies by splitting Two Towers in half and attaching it to the other two. Peter Jackson had the vision to film all three at once and New Line took a gargantuan risk in funding it- now they have mad nearly $800 million worldwide and I couldn't be happier for them. Another criticism has been about the ambiguity of the plot and lack of character development- I fail to see either of these two. Aragorn evolves from a mysterious stranger to group leader to heir of Gondor right before our eyes, Frodo evolves from fun-loving, ale drinking, life-loving hobbit to frightened, but willing deliverer to finally accepting the role as a heroic ring-bearer who has to accomplish the mission alone (as Galadriel tells him for those of you who don't like to listen to dialogue). I'll admit the development of some of the others isn't quite as clear as some, but you have to realize that much of that will be revealed in the next two movies. As far as plot weaknesses- well, this one frustrates me the most when I hear peoples criticisms. Ex How come if Sauron is so powerful, it only took a lucky shot from a sword to kill him? Answer Pay attention!!! Sauron is not dead- his spirit survives and life force lives through the ring. He represents all that is evil and if he gets the rings back again the chance of defeating him again after he has amassed this army of ultimate evil and gained the allegiance of the wizard Saruman has been all but lost. Ex All it is is people fighting, walking for a while, then fighting something bigge r and stronger   Answer Yes, and all Jaws was about was a shark attacking and eating a bunch of people, people talking about how to stop it, and the shark eating some more. See, you can simplify anything if you really want to. Of course, Jaws and LOTR are about so much more than the aforementioned  summaries. If anyone is in doubt about how complex LOTR really is, then I suggest you go to your nearest video store and rent National Geographic's Making Of LOTR. As always, National Geographic does a marvelous job detailing Tolkien's inspirations and experiences in the trenches of WWI where LOTR was born. Nat.

I don't follow hockey, I still don't understand heavy jouale (a highly slang-ridden form of French specific to Quebec), and I haven't even seen Les Boys, Les Boys 2, or Cruising Bar, three of the highest grossing Quebec films ever made.  Yet, despite the amount of money these films have made, the only place you're likely to meet anyone who has seen (or much less appreciated) these films, is here in Quebec.  A film like Jesus of Montreal on the other hand, while not being as successful in terms of dollars, has reached a much broader spectrum of people.  It has played in theaters across Canada and the world, and was even nominated for an Oscar for best foreign language film.  Most writings on Jesus of Montreal focus on it being a modernization of Christ's story.  I will focus on how the film is a reflection on Arcand's own struggles.Denys Arcand is now a highly respected and admired director. However, since making Jesus of Montreal in 1989, Arcand has only made three features.  Despite his reputation, it is extremely difficult for him to get a film made.  Positive feedback no matter how strong, doesn't mean anything to the companies that provide the funding, if it doesn't rake in the cash. I mention these points for a reason, because, among other things this is one of the key themes of Jesus of Montreal.Of course, the film is about other things as well, but it is important to remark on the interesting parallel between the story that takes place in the film and Arcand's real-life situation.  In the film, Daniel's version of the Passion Play is popular amongst the public, but because the Church disagrees with the content of the play, the play is canceled.  In real-life of course, it is not the Church that prevents Arcand from making films, but still, the popularity doesn't help either Arcand or Daniel produce their art as often or as easily as they would like to.  Another parallel is that that Daniel refuses to sell out or compromise, and subsequently so did Arcand. Although Arcand has gained a lot of recognition for his work over the years, he has never made a blatantly commercial film.  Arcand's film after Jesus, Love and Human Remains, although in English and not up to his usual standards of quality, was by no means an escapist film, and was clearly not made to rake in easy money.Of course despite the message in Jesus of Montreal that trying to create meaningful art without selling out is a constant uphill battle, the film is not cynical.  On the contrary, the film seems to be saying that the rampant commercialism in the world is one of the very things that give true art its meaning. Twenty years from now, no one will be discussing Les Boys and its importance to Quebec Cinema.  Whatever makes money one day is forgotten the next and replaced by something that makes more money.  But a film with a message that remains relevant throughout the years will never be forgotten.  Jesus of Montreal is as meaningful and inspiring today as it was eleven years ago when it was released.  It has lost none of its wit or bite, and that is it's true value, not how much money it has made.

However, since making Jesus of Montreal in 1989, Arcand has only made three features.  Despite his reputation, it is extremely difficult for him to get a film made.  Positive feedback no matter how strong, doesn't mean anything to the companies that provide the funding, if it doesn't rake in the cash. I mention these points for a reason, because, among other things this is one of the key themes of Jesus of Montreal.Of course, the film is about other things as well, but it is important to remark on the interesting parallel between the story that takes place in the film and Arcand's real-life situation.  In the film, Daniel's version of the Passion Play is popular amongst the public, but because the Church disagrees with the content of the play, the play is canceled.  In real-life of course, it is not the Church that prevents Arcand from making films, but still, the popularity doesn't help either Arcand or Daniel produce their art as often or as easily as they would like to.  Another parallel is that that Daniel refuses to sell out or compromise, and subsequently so did Arcand. Although Arcand has gained a lot of recognition for his work over the years, he has never made a blatantly commercial film.  Arcand's film after Jesus, Love and Human Remains, although in English and not up to his usual standards of quality, was by no means an escapist film, and was clearly not made to rake in easy money.Of course despite the message in Jesus of Montreal that trying to create meaningful art without selling out is a constant uphill battle, the film is not cynical.  On the contrary, the film seems to be saying that the rampant commercialism in the world is one of the very things that give true art its meaning. Twenty years from now, no one will be discussing Les Boys and its importance to Quebec Cinema.  Whatever makes money one day is forgotten the next and replaced by something that makes more money.  But a film with a message that remains relevant throughout the years will never be forgotten.  Jesus of Montreal is as meaningful and inspiring today as it was eleven years ago when it was released.  It has lost none of its wit or bite, and that is it's true value, not how much money it has made.

I don't follow hockey, I still don't understand heavy jouale (a highly slang-ridden form of French specific to Quebec), and I haven't even seen Les Boys, Les Boys 2, or Cruising Bar, three of the highest grossing Quebec films ever made.  Yet, despite the amount of money these films have made, the only place you're likely to meet anyone who has seen (or much less appreciated) these films, is here in Quebec.  A film like Jesus of Montreal on the other hand, while not being as successful in terms of dollars, has reached a much broader spectrum of people.  It has played in theaters across Canada and the world, and was even nominated for an Oscar for best foreign language film.

Mickey, you're no Bruce Willis!  And the film is set in the 1950's, whereas Rourke seems a few decades ahead of his time.  I was quite disappointed that Robert DeNiro has such a small role.

I'm pretty sure people wouldn't be as eager to rent the flick if Mickey Rourke was plastered across.  But DeNiro was great in his role (a different, more low-key role than usual), and the little screen time he had I appreciated.  Lisa Bonet has proven her talent in recent flicks like High Fidelity and Enemy of the State, but she shows practically no expression throughout this film and the only reason to check out this early performance is to see how great she looks naked.

Atlantis missed its mark because it has a case of inconsistent cohesion. Animated films tend to be tight-paced. Atlantis at least has that along with its excellent animation. In at least one place, the pace is TOO fast, as in the case of the escape from the leviathan which could have been a show stopper like the Tarzan vs. Sabor battle in Tarzan if the story editors allowed it more time. The characterizations are ... inconsistent. We get a delightful introduction to most of the secondary characters, although Helga Sinclair is a huge question mark.

Atlantis missed its mark because it has a case of inconsistent cohesion. Animated films tend to be tight-paced. Atlantis at least has that along with its excellent animation. In at least one place, the pace is TOO fast, as in the case of the escape from the leviathan which could have been a show stopper like the Tarzan vs. Sabor battle in Tarzan if the story editors allowed it more time. The characterizations are ... inconsistent. We get a delightful introduction to most of the secondary characters, although Helga Sinclair is a huge question mark.
