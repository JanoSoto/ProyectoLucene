But this film, along with my other truly favorites, made me do that.I know that this is not so much of a movie for many, but in my opinion it's outstanding. It's that kind of a film that makes you realize its superiority and you can just point its genius in certain scenes or fractures of dialogue. But what's really great about The Talented Mr. Ripley is the strange but at the same time so real relationship between Dickie Greenleaf and Tom Ripley.I've seen this in real life. It's not the magical love story and it's not a story about Superman-like secret agent or whatever. It's about envy and unshared love. Also, what i really like in some of my favorite films, there are some scenes you just can't bare to watch. They're so embarrassing or so tense or both. Like when Dickie finds Tom dancing with his clothes on and then you learn that Freddie saw that too. Or whenever Freddie, who's extremely detestable character, makes fun of Tom. I've never hated a fictitious character more than Freddie.You feel pity for Ripley. At least i did. I read some of the comments here and i was really surprised to find out that many viewers were under impression that Dickie is a charming man. Personally i thought he was really stupid, arrogant and spoiled. Yes - he's charismatic and that's how he manages to manipulate his friends but i thought the viewers should know that deep inside he's pathetic. I liked Ripley more even after the murder. Because in my opinion it wasn't so much his fault. Maybe he was just in love. And here comes the second really unbearable scene - the one at the boat. Not so much the murder, but more the argument. We realize Dickie was just playing around the whole time regardless of Tom's feelings. He's his brother and then he finds him boring. Maybe Ripley was a little bit of a leach but his behavior was far more straight-forward than Dickie's.The rest of the film is interesting but the relationship between Tom and Dickie is outstanding. It's what makes the film so great. Great performances by Matt Damon and Jude Law. I should mention Philip Seymour Hoffman, who's brilliant. The screenplay is exceptional and the direction too. Italy is as beautiful as ever.

Basically, Tom Ripley (Golden Globe nominated Matt Damon) started with borrowing a Prineton jacket to play piano at a garden party, and there he pretends to know the son of wealthy father Herbert Greenleaf (Independence Day's James Rebhorn), who offers him $1000 to convince his son, Dickie (BAFTA winning, and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Jude Law) to come home, from Italy. There, when Tom recognises Dickie, he becomes close friends with him and his fiancée, Marge Sherwood (Gwyneth Paltrow), pretending to like jazz, and having gay feelings for him. Besides lying, Tom has the talent of impressions and forgery, and when Dickie goes to extremes when telling Tom he's boring, Tom kills him. What Marge doesn't know in her worry is that Tom is pretending to be Dickie to get his lifestyle, as he looks similar to him. Also, as Dickie, has a love interest with Meredith Logue (BAFTA nominated Cate Blanchett), but also a close friendship with Peter Smith-Kingsley (Jack Davenport). Also starring Capote's Philip Seymour Hoffman as Freddie Miles, Sergio Rubini as Inspector Roverini and Bruce Almighty's Philip Baker Hall as Alvin MacCarron. There are one or two slightly gory moments with Tom's murders, and a tragic end for him when he kills his gay lover, but this is one of those films where you know Damon and Law can be good actors. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Costume Design, Best Music for Gabriel Yared and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published, it was nominated the BAFTAs for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, Best Cinematography, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Original Score.

Loosely connected main narratives elegantly associate, one of a serious, cold-blooded crime with Martin Landau's beloved opthalmologist and family man Judah Rosenthal at the center, another of everyday indiscretions, rejection and romantic envy between Woody Allen's struggling documentarian Clifford and Alan Alda's insufferable TV producer Lester, together with the trouble of lofty moral aim.

If there were no true goal, absolution, some sort of higher power, unlike what Judah's Rabbi Ben, played by Sam Waterston, believes, why shouldn't one just see, past our capricious predictions of the cosmos, our bold affirmations of life, the frigid eyes of apathy that we assume are actually there?

More truly means less to really good performers like Martin Landau, Alan Alda, Mia Farrow, Anjelica Huston, Woody Allen. They get simpler, more elemental, they stop acting. They play characters seamlessly, but they listen, react as themselves. While each scene feels so simplistically, naturally executed, each is a multidimensional creation. There are very unassuming symbols that elicit meaning without having to be explained, adding subtle touches of texture. There are agendas, emotional baggage, painful secrets, unconscious motivations.Akin to Hannah and Her Sisters in its hyperlink composition and The Purple Rose of Cairo in its sulky premise going hand-in-hand with humor and nostalgia, the movie's surreptitious power, indeed its composition, comes from the candor of the exacting fine points through which it lands at its own poignantly relatable overview. The film arrives at what seems like a dual understanding, really two counterpoints of the same single one. Firstly, we hear the voice of Clifford's documentary subject, who logically emphasizes the senselessness of existence, where all too often the good suffer while the evil flourish.

It is well known that many US servicemen serving in that horrid war were introduced into a wide array of drugs and chemicals. Given the hellish life they were forced to endure it is not without a large measure of sympathy when we acknowledge their choices. We would most certainly have succumbed to some such numbing substance in order to dull the pains.Running drugs out of South East Asia went from a small scale to much larger scale operation during the 'nam years. Many GI's got caught up in the deals, at some point not caring any more if they got caught. The premise of the film, while a bit hard to believe (he sends 2 kilos of pure heroine back to his wife who knows nothing about it's arrival) probably happened more than we know. The involvement of dark figures from either the mafia or corrupt police officials (I could not figure out what they are were) just takes this film into murkier grounds.A telling line that haunts the remainder of the film comes early. Nick Nolte says, after having been asked to run the drugs that's bad karma, referring to the heroine. How much this is his truth comes at the end. There is little funny about this movie and it just goes from bad to depressingly awful. The attempt of Nolte's character to fob off the heroine to a fat flunky old friend spins wildly out of control with Nolte helping to get the prospective buyers (drug novices) screamingly and sickeningly high; I felt ill watching that scene. It's bad enough that Michael Moriarity's character gets tortured; he thought that he had left all of that behind in 'nam; to quote one of the bad guys no boobie, it didn't go away. There is little left of your emotions when your finished with this visit to the domestic, Vietnam era America. It is hard to say what is at fault here. Is it foolish American's who will do anything to score drugs? Is it the blowback from the war, with the drug addled soldiers unable to contain their need to indulge in drugs and other excesses?Think of other 'nam movies, especially The Deer Hunter. At the end of the film one of the main characters has fallen so low that he ends his days in a drug hazed cloud of Russian Roulette, unable to hear the screams of his beloved friend frantically trying to pull him back from hell.

The movie is clearly a thriller but the movie does never gets tense and lacks in good thriller moments.The movie has a good and tense mysterious atmosphere at first but the movie does nothing further to exploit this after its opening. For too long nothing really happens in the movie, also because the husband in fact really isn't acting that weird and suspicious as before the accident in space. Certainly not enough to become afraid of him and not even the ending of the movie can really change this.The reason that this movie also doesn't work is because the motivations aren't clear. It makes the entire story and movie feel rather pointless and makes it unclear. Also when the wife learns that her husband is possibly an alien, she doesn't investigate but she is in constant denial. Is it tense and interesting to watch a character who is in constant denial? Of course it's not. Not even for a paranoid kind of atmosphere also because we as the viewer already know that something happened and went wrong with the husband. It all makes the movie quite ridicules to watch, though it's definitely a professionally made movie with some good acting in it.We get to see Johnny Depp in a role and movie we normally wouldn't see him play. It seemed like Johnny wanted to play a villain for a change. He does this will and his acting deserved a better script to go with it.

You all know them and have your own list. I heard this of this film and read a review and thought it looked like fun. Just watched it last night and I was totally delighted. First of all, it is my own personal rule that any film that has a soundtrack by master Randy Newman is already a hit in my house. Newman's soundtrack, it has been argued, are the laces and connectors that hold this film together. While it is true to say this, it can be misconstrued as a weakness of the film; to say, for example that the film would have suffered without Newman's always deft touch is misleading - it has enough depth and strength to stand on it's own. Of course these type of movies work well with lots of music and while not all is Newman's, when his work is called for, he brings all his talents into view. In this film, as in so many other films, he is firing on all cylinders. Think of his great soundtrack work Awakenings (a personal favorite), Toy Story, Ragtime, and so many others. Sometimes a great soundtrack is non-obtrusive, like a soft background glow that we sense quite subconsciously. Other times it's really in your face and that sometimes works. This film has all kinds of period piece music which most viewers will know. Newman's additions finish and complete all the musical color you could ask for. The actors as many reviewers have stated are all superb, with Joan Allen a particularly strong presence. What lends this film to that feel good place in our hearts is the obvious charm of the fable. Only a mind made of stone would not see the parables, the metaphors and moralizing. The script is written to be open and yet with enough complication to make us stick around to see how it all winds up. While it is easy to say that it's a film about how love conquers all, it is more. This film also functions as a mirror and several times in the film a mirror is used to reveal the changes in the coloration of the person. The motif is fitting and again if you're not too dim you can see that the mirror is held up for all of us to look into. This is not a deep film nor is it philosophy for dummies. In the best tradition of classical Greek comedy, we locate our identifications with ease and recognize our own shortcomings. Rarely does a movie present this concept without falling into a morass of preaching and sermonizing. With everyone in the mythical town devoted to making things in life nice, it alone keeps the center, as it expands into awareness and discovery from exploding into chaos and anarchy. If in our own child like state we realize how black and white our own minds are, the alternative (as we gain color and gravitas, as we loose our innocence) to....Fighting in the streets as an outlet....is this movie. (The one overtly violent moment when the men rioted after seeing the naked painting is subsequently handled with calmness. The coloreds are encouraged to just clean up; retaliation is not an option they have grasped and it is wisely not introduced by David or Jennifer. How fitting it was to hear the fabulous John Lennon tune Across the Universe close the film. While he wrote that ...nothing's gonna change my world...we know that this was not true of his life or his philosophy. Lennon strove his whole life to change, to evolve and to shake others up. Maybe the director is saying the same of anyone who claims that nothing is going to change them. It is not possible to be alive and not be affected by change. This film is not a panegyric to revolution; it is the softer awakening of self awareness that can, if people choose, to move with love. This is a really terrific film and everyone shines. Superb.

The on location shots are great and noteworthy. The basic story is interesting, but the acting style is outdated. An updated version of this movie would have to dispense with obvious role playing in favor of real people embarking on a perilous journey. There are moments when the acting and dialogue seem real, but they are nullified by many other moments where the acting is overdone or inappropriate. The first scene where Humphrey kisses Kate is TOTALLY inappropriate and awkward looking. It doesn't look real. The build up to their emotions would have happened much more slowly and naturally. This scene felt forced in order to establish the beginnings of a romantic involvement.The last scene where they were frolicking in the sea was another prime example of nonordinary reality. The dialogue and mood were totally inappropriate considering their dire circumstances.These old movies were made for a naive audience whereby directors and producers felt they had to sugar coat every plot and relationship. They did this to the extent that NOBODY seemed like a REAL person. Without real characters, how can viewer empathy be fully tapped? It wasn't for me in this movie. But still, compared to most old movies, this movie had a charm that made it noteworthy.

Eli Wallach's superb acting as Tuco (The Ugly) makes him my favorite character in the movie, constantly changing facial expressions based on each situation first he is angry then he is nice, he shows the brutal and greedy side as well as the genuine and caring human side So Thumbs Up Mister Wallach. Clint Eastwood on the other hand is in his usual cool self you see in the other two movies of the No name Trilogy, Very careful on which words he uses as well as not using any words but sending a strong emotion (when he offers his cigar to the wounded man in the broken down house) that cigar makes him unique , apparently Eastwood asked Director Sergio Leone if he could stop using it in some scenes, Leone answered by saying  If you don't have the cigar, you don't have the same character.The Screenplay is very original and leaves a lot of suspense in certain scenes, you never get bored or tired although the movie is pretty long you don't feel time passing by you are just captured by the story and cant wait to see what happens next.

I wanted to see what it was all about - men stuck in perpetual adolescence. This is about slackers with jobs. Not jobs that interfere with their slacker lifestyle. They can still collect a paycheck and have time to discuss whether it was fair for contractors to die in the building of the Death Star and, if a hockey game had to be played, then just close the store for an hour.Brian O'Halloran and Jeff Anderson were really funny as best friends Dante and Randall. Rabdall understood what slacking was all about and was cool with his life. It was Dante that seemed to be in a quandary. A lot of the film was Randal trying to straighten him out. Their banter was exceedingly funny.Of course, Dante has a problem with Veronica and Caitlan, played by Marilyn Ghigliotti and Lisa Spoonhauer. The women appear to be much more mature than their love interests. Their lives are going somewhere, but they are still attracted to the slackers. What's up with that? Looking at this film just for what it was, it really told an interesting story and moved very well under the direction of Kevin Smith. There were some extremely funny sequences and I am interested in exploring more of this genre.I do have to say that this movie is definitely not for someone with sensitive ears.

The tango scene should go down as one of the all-time classic scenes. The supporting cast is superb. O'Connell gave the perfect quiet performance so that Pacino could shine. Kudos to O'Connell for his portrayal. I understand the story is a remake of an Italian film. To Pacino's credit, he did not watch the Italian version until production ended. While the film was long, I didn't want it to end. The school trial allowed Pacino to give another sterling performance. I found myself even applauding the chauffeur for his limited performance. To cap off the movie, the final scene with the two children was the perfect ending. One of my favorite movies.
