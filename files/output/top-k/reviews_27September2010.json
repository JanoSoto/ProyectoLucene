This is such a film. Changing just the score might tip it into tolerable. What's there now is a syrupy Hallmark violin jelly that swells when the composer thinks we should be following expected emotional urges.Superficially, this is a simple redemption story an old man (at 47!) is tied to his mother and is reluctant to marry the long time love of his life. She is the war widow of his best friend. The crisis that makes things end happily (in that artificial cinematic notion of happiness) is his affair with a damaged 17 year old. She is a seductive student of his. He gets carried away with the girl, repents and then teaches his real love to do the same with him.At this level, we have little material on which to build a successful narrative. But it has Dennis Hopper in one of his strong acting periods. I watched this because he recently died, and I miss him.There is one device here that could never be made to work, and it seems to have come from the inept director. Hopper's character is a teacher in a one-room rural school, to be imminently closed. He is an uneducated man himself; but is a teacher because his long-time love is one and he has a bad leg leaving him unfit for farming.But he is a poetry enthusiast, knows the passion of a possible life and tries to pass it on to his students. This is crudely represented by his desire to play on the beach. He has a painting of a beach which the filmmaker uses as a visual representation of poetry and the urges it stirs. Being carried away in this sophomoric sense means being taken by passion to the beach, which (no fooling) happens at the end. Midway in the movie, the girl drops and breaks the painting. This never could have worked. It and the immature score work against the thing.But there are some powerful, key scenes. If the filmmaker (or his producers) wasn't working against himself these three scenes by themselves with Hopper could have made this memorable, penetrating. They all are rooted in the barn.We are introduced to Hopper's character as he awakes before dawn, leaves his bed and the house where his mother is dying. He goes to the barn. There he milks the cow, with whom, we discover, he is more emotionally open than to any person. This is the first of the three anchor barn scenes. It sticks because it is so early in the narrative and because Hopper makes it so.Later, the teen girl places her horse in that barn and the rutting begins. He naively believes it will stay in the barn, but of course it gets out. We have some nudity from this lovely young girl, enough for it to register as a token of her openness. This is linked to the horse, which she rides for sexual pleasure. We see her nude on the horse. It is clumsily done, but we get the message that her sex in his world is her horse in his barn.The next anchor scene makes my heart ache. We have learned that the girl's father is a rough military type, at home killing things. We have seen the two men together, competitively hunting and we have had the pecking order established. We learn as Hopper's character does that the father is coming to get him for screwing his daughter.Now what happens works because of Hopper. He gets the hunting rifle that has been a treasured gift just received from the doctor who cared for the man's just deceased (a few days) mother. It is by way of a bereavement token. He goes to the barn, by now the well established space for his internal being. In the same loft where he lost himself in the girl's body, he takes up a sniper's position, intent on killing the Colonel by surprise. The emotion Hopper conveys is built on an entire life and we get it all.He spies a wolf, already discussed as impossible in that area &#x97; a noble animal, free. The man has a clean shot and chooses not to take it. Again, Hopper makes the soul fly. Then the scene is abruptly defused with deliberate, punctuating skill.The final anchor scene... the young girl shows up at the man's house. He has already conquered his passions and gently rejects her advances. She knows this and admits that she has set the barn on fire. Her horse runs from the barn ablaze and dies (thankfully offscreen, but the concept is revolting).

The captain is a very unhappy man. He does not want to fly missions anymore. Yossarian is quite outspoken about the number of missions required, and He speaks to several people about his problem, including a doctor and a chaplain. The doctor tells Yossarian early out that Yossarian is a victim of catch 22. Basically, catch 22 means you are damned if you do and damned if you don't. It does not matter what you do to remedy a situation, the situation remains the same. Catch 22 received no awards, and the reason this is so is because of its treatment of World War II. That is my opinion. I read the very nice and well-written biography of Alan Arkin on this website, and in I read that the Mike Nichols film was not well-received. The movie was in the theaters in 1970.Possibly the most unsavory character in the movie is Milo. Milo is fundamentally a Fascist. After all, the Lieutenant begins making deals with the Germans and evolves into a turncoat. Billed as a comedy, Catch 22 goes through a definite change of tone in the course of the story. After the highly satirical air raid, which is in no sense a drill, the film begins to take on dark overtones. The movie becomes serious, but then aseptically humorous when Yossarian meets with the Major and Lt. Colonel after a problem in town. Besides his aversion to going on the countless bombing missions, a possibly brighter side to his personality is Yossarian's interest in women. One of his better choices is a beautiful Italian who the captain sees walking by a café in the town where the squadron is stationed. The classical piece Thus Spake Zarathustra(which is also a novel) plays as Luciana walks Capt. Yossarian. Although she is not a very important character, the two have a funny conversation about bombing fish. In a movie such as Catch 22, where so many things happen, there are large gaping holes, or would be, if one minimizes any character that has more than one scene. Everyone is involved in the movie, and taking one character out is like moving a domino.Martin Sheen of Apocalypse Now acts in Catch 22, and Art Garfunkel, and Anthony Perkins from the thriller Psycho. Bob Newhart is Major Major Major and the Lieutenant Colonel is played by Buck Henry. The unsavory Milo is played by Jon Voight and Walk Of Fame actor Orson Welles is the Colonel who decorates Captain Yossarian for the successful fish-bombing mission.

Yossarian is quite outspoken about the number of missions required, and He speaks to several people about his problem, including a doctor and a chaplain. The doctor tells Yossarian early out that Yossarian is a victim of catch 22. Basically, catch 22 means you are damned if you do and damned if you don't. It does not matter what you do to remedy a situation, the situation remains the same. Catch 22 received no awards, and the reason this is so is because of its treatment of World War II. That is my opinion. I read the very nice and well-written biography of Alan Arkin on this website, and in I read that the Mike Nichols film was not well-received. The movie was in the theaters in 1970.Possibly the most unsavory character in the movie is Milo. Milo is fundamentally a Fascist. After all, the Lieutenant begins making deals with the Germans and evolves into a turncoat. Billed as a comedy, Catch 22 goes through a definite change of tone in the course of the story. After the highly satirical air raid, which is in no sense a drill, the film begins to take on dark overtones. The movie becomes serious, but then aseptically humorous when Yossarian meets with the Major and Lt. Colonel after a problem in town. Besides his aversion to going on the countless bombing missions, a possibly brighter side to his personality is Yossarian's interest in women. One of his better choices is a beautiful Italian who the captain sees walking by a café in the town where the squadron is stationed. The classical piece Thus Spake Zarathustra(which is also a novel) plays as Luciana walks Capt. Yossarian. Although she is not a very important character, the two have a funny conversation about bombing fish. In a movie such as Catch 22, where so many things happen, there are large gaping holes, or would be, if one minimizes any character that has more than one scene. Everyone is involved in the movie, and taking one character out is like moving a domino.Martin Sheen of Apocalypse Now acts in Catch 22, and Art Garfunkel, and Anthony Perkins from the thriller Psycho. Bob Newhart is Major Major Major and the Lieutenant Colonel is played by Buck Henry. The unsavory Milo is played by Jon Voight and Walk Of Fame actor Orson Welles is the Colonel who decorates Captain Yossarian for the successful fish-bombing mission.

Gekko is as rich as anyone can get from shrewd investment although his methods may be sometimes illegal or unethical. But everyone does it, he claims nonchalantly. On the other side of the coin is Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen), a stockbroker who dreams of living the high life with lots of cash flow. In the film, Fox charms his way into the tutelage of Gekko, learning the trade and getting lessons on how to make obscene amounts of money.But in the picture's most important scene, Fox confronts Gekko over his greed. How much is enough? The latter does not know. Does anyone? Wall Street is Oliver Stone's critique of a world in which money is everything; everything else is secondary. Our world seems uncannily similar. There must be something fundamentally wrong with our financial system when it values high-risk greed over low-yield ethics. It is hard to see such a system sustain itself and now with insurmountable debts and a collapsing economy, we must pay the price for our greed.In a way, Stone's film is visionary. Wall Street dissects the sins that make us slaves to the dollar sign. Greed. Pride. Lust. Envy. But he also observes that when our conscience is clear and we do what is morally right, greed can be controlled. The film is photographed with an intensity that captures the madness and the fast-paced pursuit of easy money fueled by an environment where a phone call can mean millions gain or lost.Stone's screenplay (written together with Stanley Weiser) is coherent and detailed but it fails to engage as it should. For the layman, watching Wall Street can be as tepid and boring as, well, reading a Wall Street journal. Stone's assumes that most of us know stock market jargon and how the whole system works, but half the time we are actually scratching our heads. To Stone's credit, he does make the dialogue appear momentarily exciting but after a while, it becomes an indefinable chorus of frenzied garble.The glue that makes Wall Street at the very least watchable is its characters. Douglas' Oscar-winning performance is not great but it is convincing enough to arrest our attention. Sheen does not match Douglas' ferocious display of Gekko's power and authority, but he does an adequate job portraying Fox whose character changes drastically in the film. The most understated performance goes to Martin Sheen who depicts Fox's father as resolute and moral, someone who never gives in to materialism.Wall Street is an important film but it is not very entertaining. Even when the actors light up the screen, there is a feeling that underneath the whole façade of seemingly excellent filmmaking lurks a mechanical sense of dullness. This is not Stone at his worst; neither does it rank as one of his best. Yet Wall Street is more relevant today than it was in the late '80s. It is a reminder to the Gekkos out there that greed destroys lives.

Michael Keaton isn't the brute that Christian Bale is. Keaton looks and acts the part. When you look at him in this film you believe that he is rich.

Burton delivers the complete film package while all Nolan can deliver is a bit of impressive stuntwork. Burton's Gotham City is imaginative while Nolan's Gotham is Chicago. Burton is a visionary director. He delivers unforgettable and unusual images. Nolan on the other hand is not a visionary. He keeps ripping off Blade Runner (1982) and The Matrix (1999), but he still can't deliver. Danny Elfman's score is truly memorable while Hans Zimmer's score is unmemorable. Zimmer hasn't provided a good score since Thelma & Louise (1991). Oh and Keaton's Batman has a classy Batmobile with plenty of much-needed gadgets. Bayle's Batmobile is a plastic-looking tank on wheels that can't survive a single hit from a rocket launcher. And now to the Joker. Heath Ledger's Joker is sick and over the top. He gets pleasure only out of acting like a bully. How he recruited all those loyal henchmen we'll never know. It seems the only one who drove him mad was his abusive father. And this was enough to turn him into the Joker? Something doesn't add up here. Ledger obviously ripped off some of Jack Nicholson's performance for his own, yet some fools out there keep saying that Ledger's Joker is better. Nicholson's Joker is smart and street-wise. He can come up with brilliant plans. The only thing Ledger's Joker can do is blow things up. Oh and we also know how Nicholson's Joker recruited all those loyal henchmen. Jack Nicholson is one of the best actors ever, and he's much better than Ledger. Just compare their resumes. The supporting characters in Batman are also better than in The Dark Knight.

Tim Burton's Batman is the definitive Batman. You want to know why? Well, it's certainly better than any Batman film adaptation before it. It's also better than anything released after it and that includes the grossly overrated The Dark Knight (2008). This Batman has style and intelligence. Michael Keaton isn't the brute that Christian Bale is. Keaton looks and acts the part. When you look at him in this film you believe that he is rich. You also believe that he has a hidden side to him. When you look at Bale you don't see any of this. Keaton's Bruce Wayne has a romantic relationship with Kim Basinger's Vicki Vale. Bayle's Wayne is neither charming nor lovable. He isn't even in a relationship. Tim Burton happens to be a better director than Christopher Nolan. Burton delivers the complete film package while all Nolan can deliver is a bit of impressive stuntwork. Burton's Gotham City is imaginative while Nolan's Gotham is Chicago. Burton is a visionary director. He delivers unforgettable and unusual images. Nolan on the other hand is not a visionary. He keeps ripping off Blade Runner (1982) and The Matrix (1999), but he still can't deliver. Danny Elfman's score is truly memorable while Hans Zimmer's score is unmemorable. Zimmer hasn't provided a good score since Thelma & Louise (1991). Oh and Keaton's Batman has a classy Batmobile with plenty of much-needed gadgets. Bayle's Batmobile is a plastic-looking tank on wheels that can't survive a single hit from a rocket launcher. And now to the Joker. Heath Ledger's Joker is sick and over the top. He gets pleasure only out of acting like a bully. How he recruited all those loyal henchmen we'll never know. It seems the only one who drove him mad was his abusive father. And this was enough to turn him into the Joker? Something doesn't add up here. Ledger obviously ripped off some of Jack Nicholson's performance for his own, yet some fools out there keep saying that Ledger's Joker is better. Nicholson's Joker is smart and street-wise.

I can see why many people don't like this. I am not particularly fond of it myself.The film takes place in the present day of its release (the year of 1988). It is one of the most simplistic Disney animated films when it comes to artwork, quality, attention to detail, drawings, plot and (in many cases) characters. The backgrounds and artwork are very poor for Disney's standards.'Oliver & Company' is one of the weakest old Disney cartoons, but still far better than most Disney's cinema of nowadays. On the other hand, when it comes to old Disney films, it's very easy to find much better. My impression on this movie is even more harmed considering it's based on Charles Dickens's acclaimed novel 'Oliver Twist'. I don't know how good or bad is the 1968 film 'Oliver!', which I never watched but I know it's based on Charles Dickens's famous novel.Back to 'Oliver & Company' (which I am reviewing), it has some good things too. For example, the music. Once Upon a Time in New York City (by Huey Lewis) is a touching song and is played in a touching part of the movie. Why Should I Worry? (by Billy Joel) is pretty cool. Jenny's song is pretty.What else is good in this film? Well, it has some likable characters, although I can't say the same on most of them. Starting with the likable characters, Dodger is super cool. He is, as he says, New York's coolest quadruped. Obviously, he is not perfect, but who is? Anyway, he is fun, carefree and charismatic. Billy Joel is the voice of Dodger (both speaking and singing) and he is awesome in both. Oliver is naturally cute, innocent and adorable. Jenny is a very nice rich little girl. She is humble and doesn't have the arrogance characteristic of many rich people. I think that Jenny was somehow inspired on Penny from 'The Rescuers'. I wouldn't be surprised. Even their names are very similar.As for the other characters. Winston isn't a character that I dislike, but he is nothing special. Fagin is a good guy, however so clown-like that he is irritating (although, at the same time, we feel bad for him). Clearly more annoying than Fagin are Tito and Georgette. Tito is so rude and obnoxious and, to make thing worse, he never shuts up - although it's hilarious when he gets electrocuted in that limousine and says the line «Yeah. Well, it's hard to watch anything when you're getting barbecued, man!». As for Georgette, I can't stand her. She is extremely rude, obnoxious, selfish, spoiled, stupid, sarcastic, unbelievably snobbish and arrogant, not to mention annoyingly vain and proud of herself. Good grief!Francis, the bulldog that strongly dislikes to be called Frank and Frankie (as Tito often does to provoke him), isn't a bad chap but he's nothing special either. Sykes is one of the most sinister Disney villains ever. He is like a mafia guy and a real nutcase. He is terrible when it comes to people he lends money but don't return his money. He threats with creepy attitudes and phrases such as «People get hurt» or «Somebody might get hurt». Plus, you can tell he is the type of guy who kills if somebody knocks on his door by mistake. For example, there is a scene which the dogs disguise themselves as a pizza boy and Sykes is ready to attack with a gun and menacingly wondering «Where are those dogs?», which makes me believe he'd do the same if a real pizza boy knocked on his door by mistake. He makes horrifying threats to Jenny such as «Don't cry, little girl. They only eat when I tell them to» (referring to his vicious Dobermans Roscoe and DeSoto). When he snaps his fingers, this is an order for his vicious Dobermans to attack and eat. There is one terrifying scene which he snaps his fingers and they viciously attack Dodger and leave him unconscious.

The power of director Beatty's mise en scene remains inconsistent however as he dilutes the film's impact with an excessive amount of chaotic debates among party members and squabbles between the two stars along with a few kiss and make up silhouettes of the two humping. Moderation in all these areas would have clearly removed some of the film's lethargy but Beatty's attempts to balance a remarkable historical event with a romantic interest that has Beatty the actor's same stuttering seductive charm in play from a previous fantasy film (Heaven Can Wait) and a film based in Beverly Hills (Shampoo) on the face of it alone lacks gravitas. It's the same boyish love sick puppy with the silent pained expressions we get in the two confections but we're dealing with the real world in turmoil and a lot of time could be saved if they took Rick's Casablanca speech to heart.As Louise Bryant Diane Keaton spends most of the film in a state of frustration and disappointment both personally and professionally and in the incapable hands of the limited Keaton it is one long suffering sulk to behold as Beatty peppers us with dozens of ambiguous reaction shots of her in awe and anger with the mercurial Reed. Jack Nicholson's O'Neill is laid back and so much more interesting than the red rousing Reed you almost wish the camera would follow him around for the rest of the film. Novelist Jerzy Kosinski as Zinoeiv is surprisingly effective and Maureen Stapleton brings dignity and radical rational to the role of Emma Goldman.Beatty's most imaginative move is to intersperse the film with testimony from witnesses of the era and acquaintances of the two but here too he errs by not identifying them individually and most of the anecdotes do little to flesh Reed and Bryant out at all.One could make the argument that given Beatty's status in Hollywood in 1980 this epic film about an audacious journalist who blazed his own path mirrored Beatty's trail blazing part in bringing about Hollywood's last golden age with Bonnie and Clyde. It's certainly one of the reasons why Reds fails as epic. David Lean may sympathize with Lawrence and Zhivago but he keeps his distance. Beatty's Reed is Beatty's alter ego and the camera seldom leaves his face except for Louise's wide eyed admiration of him and conflict over him. Instead of size scope and larger than life we get the socially conscious Bickersons, something that would translate just as well on a theater stage. At best Reds is very lean Lean.* Actually Jaques Feyder's 1937 Knight without Armor with Robert Donat and Marlene Dietrich in similar period and setting is that film. Surpassing Reds in nearly every department and devoid of its heavy handed pretense it makes some sharp observations about the chaotic struggle between the Reds and the Whites with Feyder displaying a more imaginative command of composition and Dietrich a far more convincing Countess on the run than Keaton's pipsqueak feminist.

Basically successful London photographer Thomas (David Hemmings), living in the 1960's, makes his living taking pictures of attractive young models in the latest fashions, and he also dabbles in a little of the pop music, free love (sex) and drugs culture. He feels however that his life is quite boring, and he tries to find ways to make some money out and about with his camera, and that is how he comes to meet photo subject Jane (Vanessa Redgrave). He captures her kissing a man in the park, and she is really insistent on getting the film immediately, Thomas is of course resistant. After buying himself a large propeller he feels he could use in a photo shoot, and dealing with aspiring models, The Blonde (Je T'aime Moi Non Plus singer - or moaner - Jane Birkin) and The Brunette (Gillian Hills), Thomas develops the photos. He gets a quick visit from Jane demanding the film, she even tempts him by taking her clothes off, but after a while together he just gives her a fake film reel. While developing, Thomas has spotted something in the photos that he would never have noticed on the day in the park, it looks like a body. He blows up the photos he has managed to capture, and close ups confirm he is looking at a body, so he has accidentally been photographing a murder commission. He goes to the park to confirm there is indeed a body on the grass, but he doesn't go to the police, he instead tries to get his agent Ron (Peter Bowles) as another witness. Unable to convince a drug induced Ron, Thomas returns to the park the next day, but the body is gone, and in his confusion and disappointment all he can do is watch some mimes play some invisible tennis, and he walks away. Also starring Sarah Miles as Patricia, John Castle as Patricia's artist husband Bill, Veruschka Von Lehndorff, Julian Chagrin and Claude Chagrin as Mimes. The most memorable scene for me is Hemmings photographing Miles (who walked out during production), going for many angles, and mounting her saying yes, yes, this was obviously borrowed for Austin Powers. Hemmings does really well as the smooth and inquisitive photographer, Redgrave is a good choice as the mysterious woman, and the film is full of a lot of then unseen territory, e.g. full frontal nudity, I think the could-have-been murder mystery could have had more added, but a good classic drama none the less. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Writing, Story and Screenplay - Written Directly for the Screen, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best British Art Direction, Best British Cinematography and Best British Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best English-Language Foreign Film.

Granted the events that occur in the movie are disturbing and downright scary at times, but to me the classic horror movie formula consists of gratuitous slicing and dicing with a one-dimensional plot. And while some of these movies can be enjoyed superficially, The Exorcist delves deeper and attempts to unsettle the viewer on a more psychological level. Willam Peter Blatty's script is based on a true story from an incident in 1949, and is a true masterpiece of creativity and imagination showing the effects these events would have on a normal family. When compared with today's modern releases, his writing style shows the inadequacies of today's movie script writers.Due to the fact this movie has been available to watch for so many years, the majority of people reading these reviews would have seen it in some form or another, so I don't feel it's necessary to document the storyline yet again.The slow pacing of the movie is extremely important, which of course goes against the conventions of current cinema releases. This is one of the points that draws the most criticism from the modern audience, most of which may have only seen the movie once, possibly twice. The exorcism scenes at the end move along fairly rapidly, and the manner in which the first half on the movie is paced is necessary to establish the normal surroundings of Regan and her mother. This gives the movie credibility rather than a slow pace, and the necessary violent and graphic scenes are crafted into the script perfectly by Blatty, rather than an incoherent blood-fest which seems to be the norm these days for movies now classified in this genre (again I still don't believe The Exorcist should be classified as horror, but unfortunately in this day and age, everything needs a category).I first viewed a heavily edited TV version of this movie in my early teens, and still found it disturbing, but highly intriguing. After viewing an uncut version years later, it still had a similar impact. Again modern audiences now feel the need to apply a scare factor to any material that is classed as horror, and due to the fact there was no CGI in 1973, they instantly dismiss the older effect techniques as dated, or laughable. If you are paying that much attention to the effects and not the storyline of the movie itself, then you are bound to have an extremely insular and limited understanding of what an intelligent movie actually is.Linda Blair is exceptional as Regan in the lead role, and from all accounts, this movie took it's toll on her and other members of the extended cast. The results show on screen, and William Friedkin did an outstanding job constructing some of the most memorable scenes and imagery to ever grace the big screen.Having viewed both versions many times now, I still prefer the original in most respects.

Having said that, the Spider Walk scene was a welcome addition.Overall, this is an extremely intriguing and thought-provoking movie, and some of the imagery will stay with the viewer years after first watching it.

Ferris Bueller's Day Off is immensely fun and likable as both a comedy and a film. It is marred slightly by some of the sentimentality, but the story is engaging and the script is smart and funny. Hughes does a very admirable job directing, and the film also boasts some lovely cinematography and a catchy soundtrack. Then there is the acting, I liked all the performances in this movie. Matthew Broderick indeed plays an arrogant, spoiled and bratty sort of character, but he actually manages to give him some likability too. Alan Ruck is also excellent as his melancholy friend, and Mia Sara is gorgeous as his girlfriend.
