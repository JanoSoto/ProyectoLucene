The book used to be my least favorite Austen story. It's since grown on me over the years, so I wanted to see how they'd it on the screen. Now I like movies that try to honor most of the book. I'd read that it bares little resemblance to the book and had modern touches like missing plot points, personality changes, reassigned dialogue and overt sexuality.Going in expecting very little, it was a pleasant surprise. You can still see how Fanny is ruled at the whim of those above her. She's way too outspoken to honor the book-Fanny, but Frances O Connor does make you like her more than the book does. Other than her, most of the other characters are quite similar to the book and well acted. Johnny Lee Miller is excellent(as always).If you love Austen, you'll just have to put the book aside and watch with an open mind. If you don't go in with an open mind, you'll probably dislike much of it. I went in with low expectations and left glad that I saw it.

Overall, Coen brother's remake outshines the original in almost every aspect (which should not be too proud of thanks to the evolution of technology and mankind in these 40 years), its bleak locale disturbs more than the yellow-hued original version in guarantee a sense of grueling western lifestyle, particularly by several supplemental sketches such as the bear man and the hanging corpse. The resurrection of western genre has tumbled through a long and bumpy way, sometimes it seems to be a pipe dream because we all admit time is a ruthless bitch, but in the hands of Coen brothers, the clicking steps are by far the firmest one to satisfy our nostalgia for that era (who could forget NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN?).It's hard to believe that TRUE GRIT actually is my first John Wayne's film if my memory doesn't fail me (which partially testifies that Western film usually is not my cup of tea), also I discovered it got Wayne an Oscar winning for Best Actor, which honestly speaking, is far from academy's normal criterion, the performance is particularly unexceptional, to me it's rather a tribute to his entire career, which is a stock and unfair trickery using by the academy (Paul Newman for example), Jeff Bridge's interpretation also doesn't take my breath away as well, mainly because his weird accent does bug me a lot. The original version is more or less an eulogy towards Wayne's iconic heroism image, his absolute priority in the film never shivers, and releases a much more amiable stance all the way till the end, and in the remake, Bridge's Rooster is excelled by the audacious poise of Mattie (an awe-stricken 14-some Hailee Steinfield), whom I insist putting in the leading actress category (in both versions). Mattie's precocity indeed shows off two divergent impressions in two films, the original one is slightly obnoxious and naive in order to cast a comparison to elect a more morally agreeable image for Rooster, while the latest one maintains a tug-of-war between Mattie and Rooster, demonstrating a contemporary ethos of our generation.LaBoeuf is a character devoid of any further exploitation in both versions. A rookie Glenn Campbell in the old version serves merely as an eye-candy (the weakest link amongst the trinity); in Coen's version it adds some intermitted gusto to the lone pair by taking several French leaves, both times he acts the role as the savior, but ended in different ways. The plots are almost identical, apart from LaBoeuf's denouement, another major modification is the ending, Mattie sacrificed one arm to pay the price of her own willfulness in the remake, which I must applaud for its intrepidity (although I should not be too much surprised because of its under Coen brothers' name tag), the true grit not only sprouting in their films, also within themselves. As for John Wayne's version, hardly a masterpiece, but still a solid one to catch my breath within its lengthy duration, one fringe benefit is that it successfully arouses my curiosity of his other noteworthy films!
