In my effort to watch all of Stallone's great films (because I adore the man) I stopped on Copland. I know that people now have come around a lot and decided this was an incredibly under-appreciated film and performance by Stallone and I for one agree. Copland is very much in the vein of films like Heat, The Godfather, Goodfellas (never much cared for that film though) and other old school classic crime films and this one focuses on a group of very dirty cops who run their own breed of organized crime. The main plot is a little cumbersome but fortunately the stellar cast and side plots make this a completely riveting drama. Many of the performances aren't exactly in your face brilliant but instead its the quiet subtle things that grow on you about this sleepy little town built by these cops. Everything culminates into this brilliantly shot end sequence that is blood soaked and completely jaw dropping. There is just this distinctive style and the entire film is punctuated by what many agree is Stallone's best performance. I personally wouldn't call this his best performance but it is absolutely his most unique.Sylvester Stallone packed on the pounds to play Freddy Hefflin. I wondered while watching this why it mattered for him to be paunchy and overweight but I think it was more about him being someone different other than just Stallone. Whether you like the guy or not you can't deny his incredible chemistry when he is on screen. He is a larger than life star and in order to pull off this role he needed to be far more subtle and not in your face and he does it perfectly. He is shy, slow moving, seemingly dim-witted but as the story unfolds you will see he is anything but. Stallone's Hefflin has simply become complacent with what is happening in his town and what has happened to him. His character is incredibly complex and I think you can really dissect Freddy and see the layers to this performance. Stallone is terrific and you have never seen him like this before or since. This supporting cast is amazing. Harvey Keitel is perfect (if not just a little predictable) as the head of the crooked cops. He runs the town any way he wants because everyone looks up to him. He does things his way. Keitel couldn't be a better fit for the role and I love the scenes with him and Stallone. I actually thought this was also one of Ray Liotta's best scenes as a crack addicted, disgraced officer who wants to break free of the crooked cops. Liotta is terrific and has some truly great scenes. I like him usually but this was a great role for him. I would never say anything bad about Robert DeNiro, I like watching him in anything but his role as IA officer Moe Tilden is achingly small and the part is actually very important to the story so it is great to see him in the film but in a very, very small way. Robert Patrick also has a very small role but somehow more significant and he is always great at being sleazy and awful as Keitel's right hand man. Michael Rapaport is decent but his part is completely predictable and very stereotypical but he does the part well enough. Also watch for solid performances by Janeane Garofalo, Peter Berg and Noah Emmerich.Director and writer James Mangold has done some great stuff. Its only been in the last few years has failed to impress me with Knight and Day and most recently the awful Wolverine film. This was one of his first films and I think his schtick is terrific crime thrillers like this. He has a gritty style and the story is easy to follow but weaves some definitively complex characters. I think the film could use just a little more polishing and there were a few errors when it comes to pacing but the film is definitely well made and fascinating to watch. For Stallone and Liotta and even a few of the others this is a huge departure in what they would normally do and they all do it well. Mangold does deserve kudos for having a truly outstanding ensemble cast and keeping those egos in check so that no one is overbearing in the cast. Everyone does their role well and this is definitely one to check out for something a little different in the crime thriller genre. 8.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"22 January 2014","score":"","review":" Years ago I watched Copland and I don't even remember what I thought of it.

I wondered while watching this why it mattered for him to be paunchy and overweight but I think it was more about him being someone different other than just Stallone. Whether you like the guy or not you can't deny his incredible chemistry when he is on screen. He is a larger than life star and in order to pull off this role he needed to be far more subtle and not in your face and he does it perfectly. He is shy, slow moving, seemingly dim-witted but as the story unfolds you will see he is anything but. Stallone's Hefflin has simply become complacent with what is happening in his town and what has happened to him. His character is incredibly complex and I think you can really dissect Freddy and see the layers to this performance. Stallone is terrific and you have never seen him like this before or since. This supporting cast is amazing. Harvey Keitel is perfect (if not just a little predictable) as the head of the crooked cops. He runs the town any way he wants because everyone looks up to him. He does things his way. Keitel couldn't be a better fit for the role and I love the scenes with him and Stallone. I actually thought this was also one of Ray Liotta's best scenes as a crack addicted, disgraced officer who wants to break free of the crooked cops. Liotta is terrific and has some truly great scenes. I like him usually but this was a great role for him. I would never say anything bad about Robert DeNiro, I like watching him in anything but his role as IA officer Moe Tilden is achingly small and the part is actually very important to the story so it is great to see him in the film but in a very, very small way. Robert Patrick also has a very small role but somehow more significant and he is always great at being sleazy and awful as Keitel's right hand man. Michael Rapaport is decent but his part is completely predictable and very stereotypical but he does the part well enough. Also watch for solid performances by Janeane Garofalo, Peter Berg and Noah Emmerich.Director and writer James Mangold has done some great stuff. Its only been in the last few years has failed to impress me with Knight and Day and most recently the awful Wolverine film. This was one of his first films and I think his schtick is terrific crime thrillers like this. He has a gritty style and the story is easy to follow but weaves some definitively complex characters. I think the film could use just a little more polishing and there were a few errors when it comes to pacing but the film is definitely well made and fascinating to watch. For Stallone and Liotta and even a few of the others this is a huge departure in what they would normally do and they all do it well. Mangold does deserve kudos for having a truly outstanding ensemble cast and keeping those egos in check so that no one is overbearing in the cast. Everyone does their role well and this is definitely one to check out for something a little different in the crime thriller genre. 8.5\/10 ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"22 January 2014","score":"","review":" Years ago I watched Copland and I don't even remember what I thought of it. In my effort to watch all of Stallone's great films (because I adore the man) I stopped on Copland. I know that people now have come around a lot and decided this was an incredibly under-appreciated film and performance by Stallone and I for one agree. Copland is very much in the vein of films like Heat, The Godfather, Goodfellas (never much cared for that film though) and other old school classic crime films and this one focuses on a group of very dirty cops who run their own breed of organized crime. The main plot is a little cumbersome but fortunately the stellar cast and side plots make this a completely riveting drama. Many of the performances aren't exactly in your face brilliant but instead its the quiet subtle things that grow on you about this sleepy little town built by these cops. Everything culminates into this brilliantly shot end sequence that is blood soaked and completely jaw dropping.

I'd heard good things, seen its high position on the ever-reliable IMDb Top 250, so I decided to take a risk and watch this 2.5 hour film. Thankfully, I was not in the slightest disappointed. In fact, I completely and utterly adored it. It's filled with great performances, gripping tension, and completely justifies its long running time.The film tells a story of land-ownership and revenge, with Henry Fonda playing against type as the villain, Frank. Fonda does this with brilliance, and manages to make you forget all of the great hero roles you've seen him play (see 12 Angry Men). He's dark, mysterious and extremely hateable. The other standout role here is that of Charles Bronson, as Harmonica. Harmonica somehow manages to be an even more mysterious character than Frank, and Bronson manages to keep this running throughout without losing a connection with the audience. The chemistry between the two is electric, and the reveal at the end why vengeance is so important for Harmonica is a stunning twist. The dialogue between them is constantly excellent, but it's also the looks and the silence that really make their hatred of each other real.Being relatively new to the genre, I cannot talk much about references to other Westerns, however there were so many things that instantly made me want to explore further. Leone's direction is fantastic, and he has a great vision running throughout the film. This is set up extremely well in the first 10 minutes, a long dialogue-less scene where three men wait for a train. For all of these 10 minutes, you're on the edge of your seat waiting for something to happen. The action sequences in the film are exciting and don't feel at all superfluous. To bring all of this fantastic film-making together is Ennio Morricone, whose score is tense, exciting and beautiful all at once. The ways that he brings the melody played by Harmonica on his instrument of choice into the rest of the score is masterful. Even though his score for The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is now seen as clichéd, he moves away into new territory while also staying familiar.For anyone who is completely new to Westerns, Once Upon a Time in the West is almost certainly the place to start. It's gripping and thoughtful all at once. And it doesn't feel for one moment like you're watching a 2.5 hour movie, you never want it to end.

Let's begin with the good parts. We have Prague, Český Krumlov and Croatia serving as the sets, I adored that, and it makes the movie better because of it. The music matches the tone of the scenes and gives a nice feeling to it. The puppet of Pinocchio is also a nice piece of professional craftsmanship and is properly used in the movie production. And there is Martin Landau playing as Gepetto and it is obvious he's doing a good job at it.But then everyone with a human brain that is properly functioning and isn't here for a cheesy half-dead experience starts to think about what the movie shows them. And then this movie falls apart. The writing is bad and that is obvious. I'm not going to do a scene analysis but just going to pick the biggest sore points I saw in this movie.For instance, we have Pepe the Cricket. I think he is supposed to be reminiscent of Jiminy Cricket in some way, but he is not helping Pinocchio really as a supporting character. I think Pinocchio just found everything he needed to know out on his own and Pepe did not really help in that. His jokes also aren't funny and he is just plain annoying. And whereas with the Disney version we clearly understood why Jiminy was doing what he was doing because the Blue Faerie asked him to do so, Pepe is just a stalker doing things for no reason or motive whatsoever. The second problem is Pinocchio's quest to become a real boy. It is contrived and comes out of nowhere and only seems to exist ''just because all Pinocchio versions are based around that''. But here there are no promises regarding him becoming a real boy if he fulfills a certain condition (like the Blue Faerie gave him in the Disney version after he was made alive and in the book at a certain point in the story), but here it is blatant wish-fulfillment and because miracles come from the heart. Yeah, that is a great idea for writing. The third problem is the lore of the world in general. Lore is information we learn about the universe of the story and what makes it tick. Some parts are nicely set up, like how Gepetto's emotional impact on a tree makes the magic in it alive so he could years later find it again and make a puppet out of it. And of course there is the water that turns people into animals they are mostly in common with and how Pinocchio escapes that by the holes in his body. It could've been done better but we understand why things are the way they are. However, there are major holes that a bit of rationalizing aren't going to save. This is mostly due to poor exposition. For instance at the end of the story we learn that Lampwick was turned back into a human because he did a lot of good deeds. Wait, what? We only were told that the water turned people into animals, not how to resolve that. If we as the audience could learn about what the solution was against it, and it turned out to be good deeds, then we understood what their next plan was and how Lampwick could resolve his tiny problem. And also, if good deeds are the answer, wouldn't any hard-working donkey-kid turn back after a certain amount of time? Weird. And then there is the problem regarding the foreman turning into a monster &#x96; wait, that isn't an animal. Why not a vicious wolf or bear or any other animal that can fit his metaphor?The fourth problem are Volpe and Felinet (get it? Fox and Feline. Yeah, great satire here.) Whereas in the book they were brilliant and deceitful, and in the Disney movie they had a clear motive to what they were doing, they're suffering here from the same problem as Pepe; what are they doing anyways? I understood the part with Lorenzini because of the money and all that, but afterwards they don't really seem to have a purpose except for staying on screen and annoying everybody. O, yes, they're supposed to bring him back to Lorenzini but they're not trying to do that. Strange.And my last big problem is the teacher. If I were a teacher back then, I would have noticed that there is a boy in my class that isn't a student of mine, and, o yeah, is A WOODEN PUPPET. He does never question it but only remarks the nose, like he had more wooden puppets before as students. Great.

As I said, it has enough action to get the bang for your buck, but it isn't as big as you might think. The finale is excellent with Arnold causing chaos by driving a bus. Weirdly enough, my favorite might just be the one near the beginning of the film. There is a hilarious fight scene where Arnie tussles with a Russian in the snow, half-naked (!) It also has plenty of stereotyping, clichés galore and a plethora of violence, mostly from gunshot wounds. It has good use of locations (They actually did shoot in Russia a bit), so the cinematography is fantastic. Arnold isn't at his best here, but it's Arnold, so he is still fun. I just felt he was a tad limited with his Russian character. There is only so many times you can stare stoically at someone before the amusement wears off. He is so charismatic that he manages to make the part work, but I don't consider it one of his best roles. He does look badass no-selling a hot rock in his hand, though. He even punches someone with it, when the rock is still in his hand! James Belushi plays off Arnold very well. He is often very funny and enjoyable to watch. I don't get why he tends to get a lot of hate. I think he's hilarious. He had some great lines in this one. Peter Boyle is good in his gruff role. Ed O'Ross is perennially angry in his part and has a crummy accent to boot. I thought he was OK at best. Laurence Fishburne is good in an early role, only without a stomach full of cheeseburgers. Gina Gershon looks sexy in workout gear and plays her role well. Final Thoughts I enjoy this movie to a certain extent. It is certainly fairly entertaining at junctures, just not very memorable. Arnold and Belushi will make it worth your while, then forget about it after you're through with it. It's that kind of movie5.7\/10 ","genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime"},{"date":"22 January 2014","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" The traditional war film went into something of a decline in the 1970s, and Midway is one of the few examples from the second half of the decade. It features an impressive line-up of top Hollywood stars, including Charlton Heston, Henry Fonda, Glenn Ford and Hal Holbrook. Some other big names, including Robert Mitchum, Cliff Robertson, Robert Wagner and James Coburn, all appear in relatively minor roles. The well- known Japanese actor, Toshiro Mifune, plays Admiral Yamamoto, although his lines had to be dubbed into English; most of the other Japanese roles are played by Japanese-Americans such as James Shigeta and Pat Morita. Most of the big-name stars play real-life individuals; Fonda and Ford, for example, play the American commanders Chester W. Nimitz and Raymond A. Spruance. The main exception is Heston who plays the fictitious Major Matt Garth, a naval pilot who takes part in the battle. The film is mostly a factual account of the battle itself, but it also involves a fictional sub-plot. Garth's son Tom, like his father a naval pilot, has fallen in love with a Japanese-American girl who has been interned along with the rest of her family. The film has one or two flaws. The romantic subplot struck me as unnecessary and was not well integrated with the rest of the film. There was on over-reliance on stock footage in the combat scenes. Trying to recreate these events might have been expensive, but the old newsreel shots have a very different look to the rest of the film and tend to stand out like the proverbial sore thumb. The film-makers have also been criticised for using one ship, the USS Lexington, to represent all the carriers involved in the battle, whether American or Japanese, but in this instance they really had no alternative. All the Japanese carriers involved are now at the bottom of the Pacific, and it would not have been feasible to try and construct replicas. (James Cameron might have tried, however, had he been acting as director). As I said, this is a fairly traditional war film, but in one respect (apart from the use of colour) it clearly reflects the fact that it was made in 1976 rather than, say, 1946 or 1956. A film about the Battle of Midway made just after the war, and certainly one made during the war itself, would have been made with a much more propagandist agenda in mind, emphasising the moral superiority of the Allied cause and probably depicting the Japanese as bloodthirsty warmongers. There was none of this in this film; the battle is simply shown as the clash of two navies, not the clash of two ideologies, and certainly not as the clash of good and evil. There is no suggestion that the Japanese commanders are any less honourable than their American counterparts. Perhaps the trauma of Vietnam had made Americans less confident of their own moral superiority in foreign affairs than they had been previously.The standards of acting are fairly high, but as is often the case with ensemble casts of this nature there is no one outstanding contribution. Anyone familiar with World War II will of course know how the battle ended, but for anyone else director Jack Smight is able to conjure up a fair degree of excitement. Rather oddly, this is generated not just by the battle-scenes themselves, which are nothing particularly special, but also by the tense game of cat-and-mouse show in the earlier scenes as both sides try to work out their tactics without being 100% aware of the strength and location of the enemy forces. At the end we are left realising just how big a part luck played in the American victory at a time when defeat could have led to the war taking a very different course. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"22 January 2014","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" The traditional war film went into something of a decline in the 1970s, and Midway is one of the few examples from the second half of the decade.

It combines quite a bit of cultures into one movie. I can appreciate that but I believe that the execution of this was poor, the acting was sub-par and the dialog left quite a bit to be desired.Forest Whitaker is great in just about every role he has. This was one of the exceptions to that rule. He looked awkward doing samurai moves on a rooftop as the moves were all there but he wasn't as fluid as you might expect from someone that was supposedly training to be a samurai for so many years. Whitaker did a very strange move every time he put his gun away. It was an attempt to show him sheathing his weapon like a sword but it was distracting and awkward. Whitaker delivered a good performance but the movie as a whole just wasn't that great. He was, however, the best thing about this movie with Camille Winbush as Pearline coming in a close second.The character of Ghost Dog is one that develops over the course of this film. Whitaker does a fine job in delivering a complex and developing character as Ghost Dog is always looking to improve himself and help those around him based on the code he lives by. As the movie progresses, you learn that the story is not so much about Ghost Dog but mostly about this code he reads. The more he reads, the more you understand his character, what the character has to do and most importantly why the character does what he does. The film progresses into a clash of codes that leads into a clash of characters. Without saying too much, this film shows what happens when one code is put against another code in the most extreme of circumstances in the large city of Jersey.The writing was a bit strange at times and came off as trying too hard to inject humor into this otherwise dramatic action film. One of the best examples is when one of the characters is rapping in his bathroom. The scene feels a little goofy and changes the tone of the film as there are some other goofy parts between serious scenes that follow. I could not tell at times whether Jim Jarmusch wanted me to take the film seriously or not because of some of the silly lines and goofiness of the delivery of lines by the mobster bosses. Another example is when Ghost Dog shoots one character in the arm twice and that character makes a point to mention it excessively as to tell the viewer how good Ghost Dog is at shooting. This is something the viewer can figure out for themselves if the filmmaker thinks they are intelligent enough. That is a prime example of poor writing as Jarmusch clearly thinks that the audience needs to play to a less educated crowd.Another problem I had that was fairly minor but equally as distracting was the character of Raymond. Isaach De Bankolé plays a charming character that seems quite unnecessary. It almost seemed as if Jarmusch was attempting to inject even more diversity into this already diverse film by adding this French speaking Haitian, Raymond. I liked the character but he could have spoke English and it would have worked just as well. The French was a bit odd and felt like a way to add filler. It didn't do much for me but I do understand why the character was there and why he would want to add someone like this. Again, it felt like a distraction more than anything.Ghost Dog was a potentially awesome film that, in my opinion, lacked in execution.

He was also undergoing a stark change in his life, one that can be seen to some extent in the film he made early in 1965 with old friend Henry Hathaway (NORTH TO ALASKA) in the director's seat&#x97;namely THE SONS OF KATIE ELDER.Wayne, Dean Martin (reuniting with The Duke from RIO BRAVO), and relative greenhorns Earl Holliman and Michael Anderson Jr. are four brothers who have returned to their former hometown of Clearwater, Texas to pay their respects to their mother Katie Elder, only to find that their family's ranch has been bought off under mighty peculiar circumstances, namely (and supposedly) a card game that their father lost, and was shot and killed for. The four brothers' reputations as overgrown juvenile reprobates (even Wayne), however, precede them; nobody's talking, not even the local sheriff (Paul Fix, of Rifleman and TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD fame); and Fix's deputy (Jeremy Slate) has a lot against them. Then the four have it out with the man (James Gregory, who had played the manipulated politician in THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE) who bought their family's ranch out in that suspicious way that he has, along with a beefy gunslinger (George Kennedy), and Gregory's vicious but none-too-sharp kid (Dennis Hopper).What was notable about KATIE ELDER was that it was the first film Wayne had done after having had one of his lungs removed (in late 1964) because of all the smoking and boozing he had done throughout his life. This required him to carry an oxygen tank with him on the set; and he had to use it a lot since he not only did a fair amount of his own stunts, but also because much of KATIE ELDER was filmed in the rarefied high-altitude air of Durango, Mexico. It didn't seem to affect his performance adversely, though; he was still doing his particular thing, being The Duke as he would be for practically every Western he did from this point forward (even in his Oscar-winning role as Rooster Cogburn in TRUE GRIT in 1969). He also was so taken with the scenery in Durango (and the cheap Mexican labor there) that a lot of the Westerns he made between this one and 1973's THE TRAIN ROBBERRS would be made in that locale.Even with Wayne's stoic presence here, he doesn't overshadow his co-stars too much. Martin, looking fairly sober, does his turn as the card-shark brother; and Gregory, Kennedy, and Hopper make for a trio of nasty villains. There is also the reassuring presence of Strother Martin in one of his many character roles; the great cinematography of Lucien Ballard; and a rousing score by Elmer Bernstein, with the title song done by the legendary Man In Black himself, Johnny Cash.While both the film and its Big Star may seem quite dated in a lot of ways, as an old-fashioned, traditional Western opus, THE SONS OF KATIE ELDER delivers the goods in ways that you would expect any John Wayne film, especially one directed by Hathaway, to do. No one will mistake it for the more radical films that would soon alter the Western (THE WILD BUNCH; ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST; BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID); but for what it is and what it intends to do, one could do far, far worse.

If you're flexible enough to appreciate the macho man cheesiness of Commando (like Arnold Schwarzenegger riding on the landing gear of a Boeing 747) as well as the chick flick cheesiness of Pretty Woman (like Richard Gere riding on the sunroof of a white limo) ...both of which are equal in amounts of cheese but from different perspectives... then I think you can have a fun time watching Practical Magic. Why? Because it seems to hit us with both extremes.On the surface, the story seems to be brewing a sinister dark comedy the Owens women just can't seem to keep men long before they kick the bucket. Tons of potential for a slightly demented Beetlejuice kinda story, or even Heathers. But instead of going in that direction (i.e. treating death as crazy joke), Practical Magic takes it quite seriously and is not afraid to get pretty sentimental on the subject. In other words, it takes a very morbid guy flick story but treats it with chick flick sensitivity.And that's just the beginning. We haven't gotten to the other dark themes of wife beating, alcohol abuse, sexual promiscuity, murder and re-murder. So, you ask, if it has all these disturbing themes and refuses to make light of them, how the heck can this be a comedy? The answer is that the leading ladies, not just Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman but also their crazy aunts played by Stockard Channing and Diane Wiest, act their roles with playful humor and endearing wit. It reminded me a little of Sex and the City, the way the stories can be downright upsetting, but the humor comes in the way the characters behave despite it all. Practical Magic doesn't rely on a silly story for its laughs but instead lets the acting pave the way for levity.Roger Ebert gave this movie a mostly negative review, saying the movie doesn't seem sure what tone to adopt, veering uncertainly from horror to laughs to romance.

For one, the latter is more fun the other and, two, discussing the film almost instantly allows for quality, intelligent discussion of cinema to ring. There are certain cinephiles that take Godard himself more seriously than they take any other director who has ever lived. Just when you thought Stanley Kubrick-fanatical elitism was out of control, spend about ten minutes, as an exercise, scouring the internet for French New Wave forums and in-depth analysis of the Godardian methods and you may be surprised at what you find.I'm only stating this because around a year and a half ago, I began my sporadic voyage into the depths of Godard with his most recent picture, at the time, Film Socialisme, which I found to be an assault on every conceivable sense and not in a particularly good way. The film was choppy, disjointed, messy, just about as incomprehensible as it could be, and trying to find justifications or analyses online proved ineffective. All and all, it's a film I just want to forget and I didn't care to dive into Godard much after that endeavor. I now realize that a decent part of the blame is on me for choosing perhaps the wrong film to begin my Godardian journey with. I emerge from seeing Breathless (known by its French title as À bout de soufflé) with a more of a positive reaction. This is a bravely-structured and maturely handled annihilation to every cinematic convention prior to its 1960 release down with class and impenetrable style on part of Godard.The story - even though it is relatively the least of our concerns - follows Michel (Jean-Paul Belmondo), who is trying to emulate the characteristics possessed by Humphrey Bogart during the particular 40s\/50s era of menacing American crime dramas that billed him as the lead actor. One day, feeling intimidated and a perhaps a little adventurous, Michel shoots a police officer who has been tailing him and now must deal with being broke and on the run from the cops. His only companion is Patricia (Jean Seberg), an American journalist getting by in life by selling newspapers in downtown Paris. The two desperately skim through their options trying to hide from the police, one of which is skipping town and going all the way to Italy as fugitives.I say the story is the least of our concerns because there is simply not much to it. After all, Breathless is an aesthetic breakthrough rather than a narrative one. Godard employs dangerously subversive jump cuts - where the camera cuts to another shot within the same frame creating a breach in continuity - along with rapid-fire, quick shots and lengthy dialog scenes. All of this broke French cinema convention, which, prior to this, was consistently polished and very elegant. Godard invited in a rebellious messiness to the picture, almost like the guy coming into a neatly-organized room and rustling all the papers and files to not only create a stir but to do something different, something completely new.It's almost shortchanging to simply say that I have immense respect for Godard seeing as in 1960, a time when social change and civil unrest amongst adolescents and twentysomethings seemed to be so prevalent in many different places, he ushered in a new way of doing things cinematically and created a stylistically bold film because of it. He even threw in the element of using a hand-held camera, an unheard of practice during this particular time. I think I would also be in line to compare Breathless to Bonnie and Clyde, a film that would enter the picture seven years later in American studios that would simultaneous shock and stimulate audiences everywhere.Godard's films have a unique power after you watch them. For example, it has been about four days since I sat down to watch Breathless and since watching it - and now writing a medium-length analysis of it - I have a strong, biting urge to watch more of Godard's films.

Directed by Jean-Luc Godard. ","genre":null},{"date":"22 January 2014","score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Watching Jean-Luc Godard's massively influential, unintentional-classic Breathless and discussing Jean-Luc Godard's massively influential, unintentional-classic Breathless are two totally different things. For one, the latter is more fun the other and, two, discussing the film almost instantly allows for quality, intelligent discussion of cinema to ring. There are certain cinephiles that take Godard himself more seriously than they take any other director who has ever lived. Just when you thought Stanley Kubrick-fanatical elitism was out of control, spend about ten minutes, as an exercise, scouring the internet for French New Wave forums and in-depth analysis of the Godardian methods and you may be surprised at what you find.I'm only stating this because around a year and a half ago, I began my sporadic voyage into the depths of Godard with his most recent picture, at the time, Film Socialisme, which I found to be an assault on every conceivable sense and not in a particularly good way. The film was choppy, disjointed, messy, just about as incomprehensible as it could be, and trying to find justifications or analyses online proved ineffective. All and all, it's a film I just want to forget and I didn't care to dive into Godard much after that endeavor. I now realize that a decent part of the blame is on me for choosing perhaps the wrong film to begin my Godardian journey with. I emerge from seeing Breathless (known by its French title as À bout de soufflé) with a more of a positive reaction. This is a bravely-structured and maturely handled annihilation to every cinematic convention prior to its 1960 release down with class and impenetrable style on part of Godard.The story - even though it is relatively the least of our concerns - follows Michel (Jean-Paul Belmondo), who is trying to emulate the characteristics possessed by Humphrey Bogart during the particular 40s\/50s era of menacing American crime dramas that billed him as the lead actor. One day, feeling intimidated and a perhaps a little adventurous, Michel shoots a police officer who has been tailing him and now must deal with being broke and on the run from the cops. His only companion is Patricia (Jean Seberg), an American journalist getting by in life by selling newspapers in downtown Paris. The two desperately skim through their options trying to hide from the police, one of which is skipping town and going all the way to Italy as fugitives.I say the story is the least of our concerns because there is simply not much to it. After all, Breathless is an aesthetic breakthrough rather than a narrative one. Godard employs dangerously subversive jump cuts - where the camera cuts to another shot within the same frame creating a breach in continuity - along with rapid-fire, quick shots and lengthy dialog scenes. All of this broke French cinema convention, which, prior to this, was consistently polished and very elegant. Godard invited in a rebellious messiness to the picture, almost like the guy coming into a neatly-organized room and rustling all the papers and files to not only create a stir but to do something different, something completely new.It's almost shortchanging to simply say that I have immense respect for Godard seeing as in 1960, a time when social change and civil unrest amongst adolescents and twentysomethings seemed to be so prevalent in many different places, he ushered in a new way of doing things cinematically and created a stylistically bold film because of it. He even threw in the element of using a hand-held camera, an unheard of practice during this particular time.

So, I decided to watch it. And it was one of the best cinematic decisions. I never really read the book published in 1962 by Anthony Burgess. But after seeing the movie, I really want to read it. But let's talk about this incredible movie. As you might notice, the choice of this adjective that I gave for the movie summarizes what I thought about it. The actors, the director, the psychological plot, the movie set... holy crap! Alexander Delarge (Malcolm McDowell) as the protagonist really made the difference. I cannot think about another actor in his place. Stanley Kubrick, the director of this work of art A clockwork orange where he worked several different techniques uniting them all in this show that even after all these years still is among the most remembered and exciting movies. The plot is about the life of a young man named Alexander DeLarge. He is the leader of a gang of thugs. In one of his crimes, he is arrested. It is from here that starts an interesting theme. Inside the prison, there are political and religious approaches.And then, he is used as a guinea pig of the project healing of violence. I'm not sure about the name of this project. I guess it is The Ludovico treatment. But the point it is the treatment he is subjected to is so hard. He is forced to watch scenes of violence on TV with the soundtrack &#x96; the ninth symphony of Beethoven (his favorite song). Although he likes the images of forced sex and violence, he has a reflux. That is the therapy, reverse therapy. Themes such as violence, brainwashing, free will guide the movie. While I watched the treatment of Alex made me remember that Big Brother Brazil started recently for the 14ºth time in Brazil. I never enjoy this kind of TV show. But I know that a lot of people watch and enjoy it. TV has a great power on people and this scares me. The TV show Big Brother Brazil was created based on this book Nineteen Eight-four. This book of Eric Arthur Blair also approaches this subject. His book portrays the daily life of a totalitarian and repressive political regime of the year (1984). Eric shows how an oligarchical collectivist society is able to suppress anyone who opposes her. Here it brings a polemical subject that is worked in the movie by Kubrick the influence that TV has on people. That's why I really enjoy this movie. There is a huge possibility of discussion of the film in various areas and fields. As the narrator of the plot is the main character himself (Alex DeLarge),we (readers) stay close to the character and inevitably we support him.We believe on the transgression of Alex. There is an interesting fact about the movie set. The Korova Milk Bar was baptized after the Russian word for cow and his sculptures were based on the work of sculptor Allen Jones. One of the wall paintings appears in the movie The Shining, 1980 (Another movie that I really enjoy.) In the scene where Alex talks with the priest about the Ludovico treatment, you can see prisoners marching in a circle in the courtyard. This scene makes association with the painting by Vincent Van Gogh, Prisoners exercising (1980). I recommend not watching only once, but several times and trying to understand the proposal of this fantastic drama. However, it is always good to remember the age group indicated for the film because there are several strong scenes.
