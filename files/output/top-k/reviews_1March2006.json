There is no point. There is a very complicated, and in the end quite anti-climactic story. What there is ,however, is more inventive charm than a circus show put on by David Lynch. Not to mention loads, and loads, and LOADS of laughs. I LOVED it. And so will you.Jeff Bridges plays The Dude, or his Dudeness, or El Duderino If you're not into the whole brevity thing. We are treated at first to the site of our protagonist being given a rather unpleasant gift by two goons sent to recover some sort of payment. As it turns out, they have the wrong man. Soon the dude finds himself entangled in a web of lies, as he attempts to find out who the money came from, and why they owe it. There are many plot twists along the way, which I won't ruin, although it's futile to think this film is about plot.This is perhaps the Coen Brothers' most creative work to date. Even their wildly abnormal works like Raising Arizona have been matched for delightful weirdness, in the form of The Dude's various trip-out dream sequences. This being a Coen's film there is no such thing as a small part. Check out John Turturro's wild cameo as malodorous Paedophile-cum bowling deity Jesus Quintana. Or Sam Elliot as the film's bookending cowboy narrator. He sums the film up brilliantly two minutes in when, as our narrator, he says Maybe I just lost my trail of thought. Maybe...After viewing The Big Lebowski I was convinced that Jeff Bridges' sole existence on earth was to play The Dude. He is just perfect as the man who seems to get through all the destruction in his life with an apathetic retort of dowdy-hippydom. In a demented way it's what makes him so tranquilly admirable. John Goodman matches The Dude's bathos with psychotic blunder, and Steve Buscemi's Donnie is a rare Buscemi treat of cluelessness.Despite it's convolutions The Big Lebowski never feels unrewarding in its Rubik's-cube plotting. Whereas earlier works like the ambitious Miller's Crossing (1992) were flawed on basic storytelling levels, here we are treated to the demented worlds first, and story second. The denouement is somewhat of an anti-climax but by that point you are so far into the world of deadbeat optimism that you won't be disappointed. In fact, the indifference to it's own crescendo makes for a very fitting finale. In the end, it's not the destination the counts, it's the ride. And what a ride. I don't think Joel and Ethan have written a script with better lines, nor do I think they've ever had a better cast. This is a film without meaning, but loads of heart. And white Russians too.

I'd only seen the occasional clip of her from X Files or the odd award show, but she always came across as vapid and slightly unlikable. My opinion didn't exactly change after watching this movie, but she handled the role better than I anticipated.No, what I disliked most about this film was pretty much everything else the plodding, dull direction that misses every opportunity to invest the story with the vitality and suspense it has in the novel; and the screenplay, which obligatorily hits all the plot points but misses all the nuances and shades of character that Wharton offers. The resulting movie is even drier than the stuffiest Merchant\/Ivory project and wouldn't give anyone a sense of what makes the book so powerful. The novel is a page-turner, believe it or not. It's at times unbearably suspenseful--but you wouldn't know it watching this movie.Lily Bart is one of the best heroines ever created in the history of literature, and Anderson, even if better than I thought she would be, simply isn't up to the task of portraying her. Lily should be a life force; there should be something startling and enigmatic about her. Heads should turn when she walks in the room. Anderson's approach is much more waif like. Her Lily is passive, submissive, meek. The scene in which Lily attends the reading of her aunt's will amid a batch of disapproving relatives should come across with the force that Scarlett O'Hara's party entrance wearing a bright red dress has in Gone with the Wind. And the scene in which Lily finally says goodbye to Selden should be heartbreaking, but it doesn't resonate here. Nothing resonates.The House of Mirth would make a terrific movie in the right hands.

What is interesting to me is how when MIDNIGHT COWBOY came out in 1969, it was so shocking to viewers that it was rated X. Of course, at that time X meant Maturity. Since I was only two years old at the time of the movie's release, it is hard for me to imagine just how shocked viewers were back then. However, when I try to take into account that many of the topics covered in the film, which included prostitution (the title itself was slang for a male prostitute); homosexuality; loneliness; physical (and to some extent emotional as well) abuse and drugs are hard for many people to talk about to this day, I can begin to get a sense of what viewers of this movie thought back on its release. It is worth noting that in the 1970's, MIDNIGHT COWBOY was downgraded to an R rating and even though it is still rated R, some of the scenes could almost be rated PG-13 by today's standards.I want to briefly give a synopsis of the plot although it is probably known to almost anyone who has heard of the movie. Jon Voight plays a young man named Joe Buck from Texas who decides that he can make it big as a male hustler in New York City escorting rich women. He emulates cowboy actors like Roy Rogers by wearing a cowboy outfit thinking that that will impress women. After being rejected by all the women he has come across, he meets a sleazy con-man named Enrico Ratso Rizzo who is played by Dustin Hoffman. Ratso convinces Joe that he can make all kinds of money if he has a manager. Once again, Joe is conned and before long is homeless. However, Joe comes across Ratso and is invited to stay in a dilapidated apartment. Without giving away much more of the plot, I want to say that the remainder of the movie deals with Joe and Ratso as they try to help one another in an attempt to fulfill their dreams. I.E. Joe making it as a gigolo and Ratso going down to Florida where he thinks he can regain his health.I want to make some comments about the movie itself. First of all, the acting is excellent, especially the leads. Although the movie is really very sad from the beginning to the end, there are some classic scenes. In fact, there are some scenes that while they are not intended to be funny, I find them amusing. For example, there is the classic scene where Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight are walking down a city street and a cab practically runs them over. Dustin Hoffman bangs on the cab and says Hey, I'm walkin' here! I'm walkin' here! I get a kick out of that scene because it is so typical of New York City where so many people are in a hurry. Another scene that comes to mind is the scene where Ratso (Dustin Hoffman) sends Joe (Jon Voight) to a guy named O'Daniel. What is amusing is that at first, we think O'Daniel is there to recruit gigolos and can see why Joe is getting so excited but then we begin to realize that O'Daniel is nothing but a religious nut. In addition to the two scenes I mentioned, I love the scene where Ratso and Joe are arguing in their apartment when Ratso says to Joe that his cowboy outfit only attracts homosexuals and Joe says in self-defense John Wayne! You gonna tell me he's a fag! What I like is the delivery in that scene.I would say that even though MIDNIGHT COWBOY was set in the late '60's, much of it rings true today. That's because although the area around 42nd Street in New York has been cleaned up in the form of Disneyfication in the last several years, homelessness is still just as prevalent there now as it was 40 years ago. Also, many people have unrealistic dreams of how they are going to strike it big only to have their dreams smashed as was the case with the Jon Voight character. One thing that impresses me about Jon Voight's character is how he is a survivor and I felt that at the end of the movie, he had matured a great deal and that Ratso (Dustin Hoffman's character) was a good influence on him.In conclusion, I want to say that I suggest that when watching this movie, one should watch it at least a couple of times because there are so many things that go on. For example, there are a bunch of flashback and dream sequences that made more sense to me after a couple of viewings. Also, what I find interesting is that there is a lot in this movie that is left to interpretation such as what really happened with Joe Buck (Jon Voight's character) and the people who were in his life in Texas. Even the ending, while I don't want to give it away for those who have not seen the movie, is rather open-ended.

First of all, the acting is excellent, especially the leads. Although the movie is really very sad from the beginning to the end, there are some classic scenes. In fact, there are some scenes that while they are not intended to be funny, I find them amusing. For example, there is the classic scene where Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight are walking down a city street and a cab practically runs them over. Dustin Hoffman bangs on the cab and says Hey, I'm walkin' here! I'm walkin' here! I get a kick out of that scene because it is so typical of New York City where so many people are in a hurry. Another scene that comes to mind is the scene where Ratso (Dustin Hoffman) sends Joe (Jon Voight) to a guy named O'Daniel. What is amusing is that at first, we think O'Daniel is there to recruit gigolos and can see why Joe is getting so excited but then we begin to realize that O'Daniel is nothing but a religious nut. In addition to the two scenes I mentioned, I love the scene where Ratso and Joe are arguing in their apartment when Ratso says to Joe that his cowboy outfit only attracts homosexuals and Joe says in self-defense John Wayne! You gonna tell me he's a fag! What I like is the delivery in that scene.I would say that even though MIDNIGHT COWBOY was set in the late '60's, much of it rings true today. That's because although the area around 42nd Street in New York has been cleaned up in the form of Disneyfication in the last several years, homelessness is still just as prevalent there now as it was 40 years ago. Also, many people have unrealistic dreams of how they are going to strike it big only to have their dreams smashed as was the case with the Jon Voight character. One thing that impresses me about Jon Voight's character is how he is a survivor and I felt that at the end of the movie, he had matured a great deal and that Ratso (Dustin Hoffman's character) was a good influence on him.In conclusion, I want to say that I suggest that when watching this movie, one should watch it at least a couple of times because there are so many things that go on. For example, there are a bunch of flashback and dream sequences that made more sense to me after a couple of viewings. Also, what I find interesting is that there is a lot in this movie that is left to interpretation such as what really happened with Joe Buck (Jon Voight's character) and the people who were in his life in Texas. Even the ending, while I don't want to give it away for those who have not seen the movie, is rather open-ended.

What is interesting to me is how when MIDNIGHT COWBOY came out in 1969, it was so shocking to viewers that it was rated X. Of course, at that time X meant Maturity. Since I was only two years old at the time of the movie's release, it is hard for me to imagine just how shocked viewers were back then. However, when I try to take into account that many of the topics covered in the film, which included prostitution (the title itself was slang for a male prostitute); homosexuality; loneliness; physical (and to some extent emotional as well) abuse and drugs are hard for many people to talk about to this day, I can begin to get a sense of what viewers of this movie thought back on its release. It is worth noting that in the 1970's, MIDNIGHT COWBOY was downgraded to an R rating and even though it is still rated R, some of the scenes could almost be rated PG-13 by today's standards.I want to briefly give a synopsis of the plot although it is probably known to almost anyone who has heard of the movie. Jon Voight plays a young man named Joe Buck from Texas who decides that he can make it big as a male hustler in New York City escorting rich women. He emulates cowboy actors like Roy Rogers by wearing a cowboy outfit thinking that that will impress women. After being rejected by all the women he has come across, he meets a sleazy con-man named Enrico Ratso Rizzo who is played by Dustin Hoffman. Ratso convinces Joe that he can make all kinds of money if he has a manager. Once again, Joe is conned and before long is homeless. However, Joe comes across Ratso and is invited to stay in a dilapidated apartment. Without giving away much more of the plot, I want to say that the remainder of the movie deals with Joe and Ratso as they try to help one another in an attempt to fulfill their dreams. I.E.

Its also one of my favorite movies like Terminator, and because of this Cameron gets a lot of respect from me. Two classics by the same director? You just can't go wrong with that.Ripley (Sigourney Weaver in a role that never quite type cast her) is found 57 years after the first Alien film. She is picked up by a salvage team and sent back to Earth, where things have changed quite a bit during her very long sleep. She also discovers that she has outlived her daughter, but the edited version doesn't give her anytime to mourn. I've never seen the director's cut, but I heard it goes into more detail about this.Not long after this she is sent to some sort of board meeting where she has to explain what happen. Her story is of course meant with skepticism, but it is at this meeting that she finds out that LV-426, the planet where she first discovered the hostile Alien with her Nostromo Crew, has now been occupied by colonists who are now able to live on the harsh planet because of Atmosphere Processors.The skepticism proves false though when transmissions with the colonists are suddenly lost. So Ripley, with a high-tech combat team of marines to back her up, returns to the planet to destroy the vicious creatures forever and put an end to her nightmares. Of course the Aliens, now way more than one, aren't going to be beaten so easily. And the only help they have is one little girl named Newt (Carrie Henn) who is the only colony survivor and knows a little bit about the creepy monsters. Newt also taps into Ripley's motherly instincts and strengthens her for her final meeting with the hateful Queen alien and leads to the thrilling climax.I don't really have to summarize the plot anymore. Let's just say that the acting in this film was superb. Michael Biehn, Lance Hendricksen, Jenette Goldstein, and Bill Paxton give great performances, and what can I say about Sigourney Weaver. She is just one of the best female action heroes that ever crossed the screen.The visuals were remarkable and still hold up today, and the pacing was classic Cameron. This guy knows how to make and action film, and he also knows how to cross genres like horror and sci-fi as well as drama. He did the same thing with 1984s Terminator, and he doesn't slip at all with Aliens. A great film.

As others have said, his Freddy character comes across more as mildly retarded than broken-spirited. Next up The great cast. Another huge underachievement. Some of the best actors turn in some of their worst performances. Kietel brings none of his usual charm or depth to a role that required at least a fake persona of trustworthiness, to make his ringleader role seem believable. DeNiro (whom, admittedly I have always found a tad overrated and limited in the types of roles he can play) absolutely mails this one in. The others are given little else to do except stand around and play tough guy\/disenchanted wife\/scared subordinate as the case may be. Sure, Ray Liotta chews some scenery, but it somehow winds up seeming out of place compared with the tone of the movie. Finally, the plot is absolutely ludicrous. The idea that Superboy would somehow live in a water tower after the events that transpired is comical. And does Freddy have absolutely no one else he can call when transferring Superboy out of the police station, so much so that he gets jumped, alone, by two of Kietel's goons in broad daylight right outside the station? Ever heard of a phone Freddy? To other Jersey cops, to the media, to the FBI? All in all, a bizarre and just plain weird movie that winds up being so much less than the sum of its parts. In that regard, I have to agree with a previous poster named Yisraelh, who says that there is just something wrong with this movie that is hard to identify. I know exactly what he or she means.
