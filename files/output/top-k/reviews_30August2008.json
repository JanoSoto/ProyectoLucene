Obviously, after the extreme success of (Scream) at the end of the 1990s, the low budget Horror-high school movies came to an explosion (Urban Legend, The Faculty, I Know What You Did Last Summer, even Carrie 2 !). BUT, don't you ever forget that it's still the B-movie.. The determined to be nothing but a loyal one. Comes with that, naturally I think, all the known disasters of the case  blood all over the place, bad acting, cheesy moments, bad script, lots of screams, and no convincing logic; however who said anything about such a forbidden factor? Logic is the ultimate spoiler of this kind of parties, so let's skip it.In any rate that's not a winning deal for me, I don't like the whole genre of Horror so what about its lower flicks ? But the rest of the factors here made it to be worth watching as original campy movie ! Take this list (Jennifer Love Hewitt) is unbearable with her provocative face and her non-harmonious non-sexy body, those assets annoyed me very, and at the scene of her bikini she was extremely PATHETIC, I think Mini Mouse in a bikini can be hotter than this. Mr. (Freddie Prinze Jr.) ! This guy must be put in all the books which talk about the paradoxes of Hollywood.. He got no charisma and such a tiny talent but he was on the posters of the cinema near my house for almost 2 or 3 years as the lead of something like 47 movies ! Who's that guy anyway ?? Moreover, I was blessed by watching the first movie (at least there was sense of coherence) so here, the whole plot looked perfectly absurd, and don't ask questions like who killed whom? And why ? Because they didn't make that kind of movies to ask such very silly questions, or to ask at all !. (The thrill makes me horny) I believe the black dude said that near the third act, and what a line to summarize the whole movie and its kind in the genre.I was sad only when (Jack Black) was killed as he didn't do anything, just like the poor me while watching. Also the sexy girls at the beach, we didn't get enough of that already. Though this bunch of movies was mostly distinguished by their well made cinematic technique, I liked the sharp editing and especially the cinematography, it was like poetry in a bloody wrestling match sublime and misplaced. Thanks anyway to the directorial job of (Danny Cannon) the man who brought us once (Judge Dredd - 1995). Well.. Every summer Hollywood gives us the usual merchandise and you can choose freely. Therefore here, whether to feel how it is adulterate merchandise, or that this is the right thing to do inside that frame of brainless slasher movie for diverting 90 minutes. I liked the explicit desire and work to achieve that, which made it a pure comedy for me. And they made parodies about that?? Why ? This is more comic and higher ironic. As I told you earlier.. It's easy movie, or easy movies.There isn't yet a third one, maybe because the confusion of what to call it (I'm Sure I Still Know What You Did Last Summer ??), but I think this movie's makers understood utterly what movie they were making and its previous likes. So wait for the last shot here to observe the intent of making another sequel, and the mocking at it too.

","genre":"Horror, Mystery"},{"date":"30 August 2008","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Because of its box office failure after one or two other films a bunch of expert movie house owners called Katherine Hepburn Box Office Poison on a notorious list in the late 1930s. Fred Astaire and Marlene Dietrich were also on that list. One would love to know what other great prognostications and viewpoints this bunch of yokels made over the years. Did they predict Dewey would beat Truman too? Or that Sputnick proved the Russians would land on the moon first? I only hope that they ended up being laughed into oblivion by their families and friends. For Bringing Up Baby was one of the funniest movies of the 1930s. It is not flawless - the Katherine Hepburn character is the supreme example of the spoiled madcap heiress of the genre of madcap comedies of the 1930s. And she certainly gives the viewers much to laugh at, such as her impossible readiness to steal objects from golf balls to automobiles, or to try to wake sleeping people up by throwing pebbles at a window, or trying to calm a leopard down from the roof by singing with Cary Grant, I Can Give You Anything But Love. In no other comedy she made is Hepburn so ditsy. But the behavior of Hepburn is the sole problem of the film. She does such a number of things to keep Grant under her control while she derails his marriage plans that she almost makes the viewers dislike her. But Grant is such a dud personality from the start of the film that one can understand why she has such an easy time pulling him around.Howard Hawks made several comedies with Grant, most notably His Gal Friday. But in two of them Grant plays men who each end up being a yo-yo for the women who love them. The other one is I Was A Male War Bride, where Hawks paired Grant with Anne Sheridan, and puts him through a series of humiliations that go all the way to the conclusion. Both are equally funny films, but both are set in their times, one a peacetime film the other a post-war comedy. But the conclusion of Bringing Up Baby is more memorable - when the life's work of Grant, the anthropologist, is shattered. The fall of the brontosaurus (again caused by Hepburn) is so famous that it was reused in On The Town (early in that film) when Jules Munshin knocks down a similar brontosaurus.Here we watch David Huxley (Grant) plans to get a million dollars for his museum and his plans to marry his assistant Alice Swallow (Virginia Walker) go down the tubes from his constant collisions with the easy going but determined Susan Vance (Hepburn) first on a golf course, then at a restaurant (she causes him to fall by trying to catch an olive which he trips on - see the summary line), to her apartment (where he meets her new pet leopard, Baby), to her shanghaiing him to Connecticut. In the end he has to wear a woman's robe (shocking Hepburn's dowager aunt May Robson), pretend he is an insane big game hunter named Bone (and get bored by tales of big game hunting from Charlie Ruggles), dig up a lot of the estate looking for a dinosaur tail bone, wrestle one leopard and release a second one, and deal with a somewhat confused town constable (Walter Catlett in a lovely absent minded performance) and an understanding psychiatrist (Fritz Feld). The film works despite being really a series of loosely tied together events. They flow from one to another, but due to the standard of lunacy involved the chunks of the film remain in our memories rather than the connecting links. But those are truly golden chunks, and make the viewers simply want to see more. This film is a real keeper for any fan to want to watch.
