The main character Joel Goodson is so easy to relate to that this movie became an all-time favorite of mine. This movie really captures the essence of teen life and shows it beautifully. In a few words, most teens are happy to be independent, desperate to be flushed with cash, and always willing to blow off steam in one way or another. Everything in this movie, from the iconic dance scene to rocking house party, really nailed how teens spend their time, making it a great film to watch if you're of that age. Not only can you see yourself in the characters, but the plot is magnificent! Very few movies (Meet the Parents comes to mind) can make you sit nervously on the edge of your seat, dreading when his parents come home, to laughing so hard that your sides hurt. Another element that I appreciate is the type of humor. Instead of making blatant, please-laugh-at-me jokes it uses more subtle comedy in which you're laughing at the situations. Tom Cruise really plays the burned-out teenager wonderfully, and Rebecca De Mornay is fantastic as the sassy yet sexy call girl. If you haven't already seen this film, please do! It's truly a classic and will leave you chuckling for as long as you remember it.

And for good reason. Everything gels perfectly in It Could Happen to You. Start with a very good story, create an excellent script, choose the right cast members, and voilà! Of course, it's never that easy or automatic. To start with, for all its expertise in film-making, Hollywood often can't tell how a film will go over with the public. I wonder if the industry isn't so engrossed in its professional business (all aspects, from acting, directing, writing, stories, marketing, etc.), that it can't accurately read the public pulse. Many times, films that were supposed to be big hits have been big flops; while many more times, second string films score big with audiences. While a film like It Could Happen to You may seem to be a safe bet, it doesn't fit solidly in a category that usually scores. It's not quite a chick flick, and it's not a full fledged romantic comedy. It has some drama with a small amount of action. And, it is packed with morality and morals, however subdued they may seem. So, with all that, I'm betting that the producers smiled and breathed a sigh of relief when this one broke out of the gates and captured large audiences and a hefty box office take. I won't give away any of the plot here. This is one that people should watch without knowing the key plot points. As I said, the story was excellent. It's about decency, kindness and generosity on one side, and greed, selfishness, and dishonesty on the other side. It's also among Nicolas Cage's best performances. This was before he developed a character person that pauses and looks confused. The rest of the cast excel as well. It's a very fun and fulfilling movie about a nice love story, made all the more so because it's encased in proper behavior. While this story is totally fictional, it might have been inspired by a real incident. In the 1980s, a New York cop and a waitress won $6 million on a lottery ticket that they split &#x96; each picking half the numbers.

However, the narrative focuses mainly on the 'Delta' fraternity which consists of a bunch of undisciplined, loutish youths who seem more concerned with throwing wild parties and in causing mischief. Fed up with the Delta Fraternity consistently underachieving, college principal Dean Vernon-Wormer (John Vernon) appoints the college dean Greg Marmalard (James Daughton) to watch every move that the Delta Fraternity makes and Wormer warns those in the Delta Fraternity that if their grades don't improve and if there are any more infractions of the rules then they will be kicked off the campus. However, the Delta Fraternity don't take this lying down and decide to fight back against their principal.To my knowledge, Animal House was the first in a long line of teen sex comedies so it deserves acknowledgement for being original and influential at the very least. Whilst, Animal House is a funny film, I'll admit that it wasn't anywhere near as funny as I was both hoping and expecting. The humour is generally of a slapstick or a farcical nature and I'd probably say 90 odd percent of the humour is visual jokes. This humour acts as both a blessing and a curse; it's a blessing because the visual jokes work and they are funny, but it's a curse as well because it is a cheap and lazy way of getting laughs. I honestly can't remember one funny line from this film that was actually uttered from any of the characters. Some of the best comedies will have dialogue driven humour and visual humour and because this film only contains the latter it is a little bit disappointing.It's also surprising watching this today how tame it actually is in comparison to films of a similar nature that have followed such as American Pie, Sex Drive, Road Trip etc. It might have been classed as risqué and gross out when it was made, but I found it surprisingly ordinary in comparison to later films of the same genre. This isn't meant as a criticism, but merely an observation. In some ways, it's good as it showed that films can still be funny without being over the top with vulgarity. That's not to say there's no smut at all because there is, but to me the smut didn't over power the story and I felt that the balance was just about right.What really saves this film are the performances from many of the actors - notably from Furst, Belushi and Vernon. Furst is a particularly talented actor who sadly never seemed to really hit the big time which is a shame - his performance in this film was nothing short of outstanding. Likewise, the late great John Belushi also puts in a memorable performance as the main trouble-maker of the Delta Fraternity (such a shame that he was taken from us at such a young age). Finally, Vernon's performance as the principal at breaking point will also stick in your mind long after the credits have finished rolling - he doesn't get much screen time, but he makes damn good use of the time that he's given.Animal House is a film that is funny and is worth checking out. It isn't ROFL funny, but there are enough laughs along the way to make it worth checking out. If, like me, you're from the American Pie generation then it's worth checking this film out - more than anything so that you can see where it all began.

All of those elements make A Fistful Of Dollars a wonderful movie that is Sergio Leone,Clint Eastwood and the Western genre at it's best.A Fistful Of Dollars tells the story of a gunslinger(Clint Eastwood) who has arrived in a town where there is a feud going on between rival families The Rojos and The Baxters and sees an opportunity to play both sides against each other and make some money. But as the feud between the two families becomes more intense it builds up to violent showdowns with the gunslinger right smack in the middle.A Fistful Of Dollars is a brilliant and unforgettable Western movie that not only was the first film in Sergio Leone's outstanding Man With No Name\/Dollars Trilogy but was also the film that made Clint Eastwood a movie star and helped make Eastwood a movie and Western icon and gave movie goers a different kind of Western that is iconic and changed the genre forever and paved the way for the popular sub genre known as the Spaghetti Western. A Fistful Of Dollars is a movie that is an instant classic from the moment you watch it and is a film that is thrilling and stylish,violent and intense as well as brutal and harsh with a power and energy that never stops until the very end. Everything in the movie whether it's the gunfights,characters,music or style is done in a big and operatic way like a huge epic that felt fresh and new. This movie would define the Sergio Leone style that would grow with each of his films. While FOD has tons of style there is still a lot of substance and story dealing with the on going conflicts between the rival families and The Man With No Name being right in the middle and with the conflict there is danger all around. Many have said that A Fistful Of Dollars is a remake of Akira Kurosawa'a classic Yojimbo and I disagree because while FOD share some similarities with Yujimbo Leone puts his own stamp on the film and makes the movie stand out. While the Western genre was still doing well before the release of FOD(thanks to various movies and TV shows)but every Western movie and television showed the West as a clean and pretty place but the West in A Fistful Of Dollars and it's masterful follow-ups For A Few Dollars More and The Good,The Bad And The Ugly is not clean or pretty but dirty and gritty the way the West really was. The whole Man With No Name Trilogy not only revolutionized the Western genre it reinvented it. The Man With No Name(although his name is Joe in the film)is one cinema's greatest movie characters and one of the most iconic anti-heroes that redefined the movie Cowboy. Before the Man With No Name came along Western Cowboys were identified by being good or bad with white hats and black hats but when the Man With No Name was introduced he was a new Western hero that was a combination of good and bad as well as the white hat and black hat with a gray area and moral ambiguity. Also,The Man With No Name is a character that has a scruffy beard,wears a great looking poncho,smokes cigars and is fast with the gun hitting anyone he shoots at and when he shoots someone they go down. While The Man With No Name is tough and cynical he does good things for people which makes him very complex and fascinating. The Man With No Name is a classic character you will never forget. The Action in FOD is sensational and intense with most of the Action being Western gunfights but each of the gunfights are done wonderfully with suspense and tension and when the tension stops the gunfights explodes like dynamite. The Western gunfights in this film The ending in A Fistful Of Dollars is amazing,Action-packed and one of the best endings in a Western film and is one of the things that makes this movie a classic. A Fantastic ending.The cast is great. Clint Eastwood is excellent and at his best as The Man With No Name(or Joe),with Eastwood being charismatic,iconic and cool. Gian Maria Volonte is terrific and memorable as Ramon Rojos,one of the leaders of the Rojo family. Jose Calvo is good and funny as Salvinto,a bartender that befriends Joe. Marianne Koch is beautiful as Marisol,a woman held captive by Ramon. Sieghardt Rupp(Estaban Rojo),Antonio Prieto(Don Miguel Rojo),Wolfgang Lukschy(John Baxter),Margrita Lozano(Consuelo Baxter),Bruno Carotenuto(Antonio Baxter),Joseph Egger(Piripero-The Undertaker)and Mario Brega(Chico)give good performances as well.The direction by Sergio Leone is outstanding and stylish with Leone using close-ups,zooms and great angles giving the movie the right tone. Terrific direction,Leone.The score by Ennio Morricone is terrific,intense,epic and matches the tone of the movie perfectly. Great score,Morricone.In final word,if you love Sergio Leone,Clint Eastwood,Westerns or films in general,I highly suggest you see A Fistful Of Dollars,One Of the greatest Westerns ever made and an excellent unforgettable classic you will never forget.

All of those elements make A Fistful Of Dollars a wonderful movie that is Sergio Leone,Clint Eastwood and the Western genre at it's best.A Fistful Of Dollars tells the story of a gunslinger(Clint Eastwood) who has arrived in a town where there is a feud going on between rival families The Rojos and The Baxters and sees an opportunity to play both sides against each other and make some money. But as the feud between the two families becomes more intense it builds up to violent showdowns with the gunslinger right smack in the middle.A Fistful Of Dollars is a brilliant and unforgettable Western movie that not only was the first film in Sergio Leone's outstanding Man With No Name\/Dollars Trilogy but was also the film that made Clint Eastwood a movie star and helped make Eastwood a movie and Western icon and gave movie goers a different kind of Western that is iconic and changed the genre forever and paved the way for the popular sub genre known as the Spaghetti Western. A Fistful Of Dollars is a movie that is an instant classic from the moment you watch it and is a film that is thrilling and stylish,violent and intense as well as brutal and harsh with a power and energy that never stops until the very end. Everything in the movie whether it's the gunfights,characters,music or style is done in a big and operatic way like a huge epic that felt fresh and new. This movie would define the Sergio Leone style that would grow with each of his films. While FOD has tons of style there is still a lot of substance and story dealing with the on going conflicts between the rival families and The Man With No Name being right in the middle and with the conflict there is danger all around. Many have said that A Fistful Of Dollars is a remake of Akira Kurosawa'a classic Yojimbo and I disagree because while FOD share some similarities with Yujimbo Leone puts his own stamp on the film and makes the movie stand out. While the Western genre was still doing well before the release of FOD(thanks to various movies and TV shows)but every Western movie and television showed the West as a clean and pretty place but the West in A Fistful Of Dollars and it's masterful follow-ups For A Few Dollars More and The Good,The Bad And The Ugly is not clean or pretty but dirty and gritty the way the West really was. The whole Man With No Name Trilogy not only revolutionized the Western genre it reinvented it. The Man With No Name(although his name is Joe in the film)is one cinema's greatest movie characters and one of the most iconic anti-heroes that redefined the movie Cowboy. Before the Man With No Name came along Western Cowboys were identified by being good or bad with white hats and black hats but when the Man With No Name was introduced he was a new Western hero that was a combination of good and bad as well as the white hat and black hat with a gray area and moral ambiguity. Also,The Man With No Name is a character that has a scruffy beard,wears a great looking poncho,smokes cigars and is fast with the gun hitting anyone he shoots at and when he shoots someone they go down. While The Man With No Name is tough and cynical he does good things for people which makes him very complex and fascinating. The Man With No Name is a classic character you will never forget. The Action in FOD is sensational and intense with most of the Action being Western gunfights but each of the gunfights are done wonderfully with suspense and tension and when the tension stops the gunfights explodes like dynamite. The Western gunfights in this film The ending in A Fistful Of Dollars is amazing,Action-packed and one of the best endings in a Western film and is one of the things that makes this movie a classic. A Fantastic ending.The cast is great. Clint Eastwood is excellent and at his best as The Man With No Name(or Joe),with Eastwood being charismatic,iconic and cool. Gian Maria Volonte is terrific and memorable as Ramon Rojos,one of the leaders of the Rojo family. Jose Calvo is good and funny as Salvinto,a bartender that befriends Joe. Marianne Koch is beautiful as Marisol,a woman held captive by Ramon.

Unlike the cartoons and comics, this is slightly different version of Spiderman with a different story. Why did they change? Dramatic purposes were needed. See the 2012 reboot to see why.

Although still timid and soft-spoken, he gains confidence and tries to win over Mary Jane Watson his life-long crush. Meanwhile, Norman Osborne's most recent Oscorp experiment goes drastically wrong and develops a vicious alter-ego--the Green Goblin--who Peter must stop.Anybody that says the 2012 reboot beats this either thinks Andrew Garfield is hot and\/or are hardcore comic fans that don't understand how movies work. Tobey's Peter Parker is kind, caring likable, hardworking and mysterious that can't seem to catch a break. Mary Jane is sweet, has high hopes, is popular, and comes from a bad home. Norman Osborne is emotionally- destructive and tortured by his other personality, Green Goblin. This Green Goblin is freaking scary, yet funny villain that hasn't yet been topped. (Well, Heath Ledger did.) The Love story is original and better than the new one. In this, Peter keeps himself a mystery from Mary Jane, yet is still her emotional comfort who is always there. The new one is just him getting the girl right away and developing chemistry. The hero doesn't get the girl in this? That is originality.

Tobey wasn't disrespectful to anybody like Garfield was throughout the whole movie. Tobey was more deserving of his powers. Tobey's Spider powers being internal makes him more of a superhuman. Garfield's discovery of his powers were so stupid. Garfield wined a lot more than Tobey did. This Peter was constantly changing throughout the whole movie, Garfield stayed the same. Tobey pulled off the geek persona while Garfield failed at a geek trying to be cool. Tobey's Spiderman delivers funny one-liners while fighting villains while Garfield breaks out into extremely stupid 10 minute songs and dances. Garfield gives up hunting his uncle's killer. Garfield only saved, what, 2 people? And caused that death of Gwen's father. Tobey saved many people throughout the whole movie and causes no deaths. Sorry for so many comparisons.

Most of them sucked. After Spiderman's release in 2002 and its sequels in 2004 and 2007, we saw the Dark Knight movies, Thor, Captain American, Iron Man, etc. Without this movie, many people in these superhero films would not have careers. Unlike the cartoons and comics, this is slightly different version of Spiderman with a different story. Why did they change? Dramatic purposes were needed. See the 2012 reboot to see why. A nerdy Peter Parker gets bitten by a spider at a high school science field trip and develops radical powers. Although still timid and soft-spoken, he gains confidence and tries to win over Mary Jane Watson his life-long crush. Meanwhile, Norman Osborne's most recent Oscorp experiment goes drastically wrong and develops a vicious alter-ego--the Green Goblin--who Peter must stop.Anybody that says the 2012 reboot beats this either thinks Andrew Garfield is hot and\/or are hardcore comic fans that don't understand how movies work. Tobey's Peter Parker is kind, caring likable, hardworking and mysterious that can't seem to catch a break. Mary Jane is sweet, has high hopes, is popular, and comes from a bad home. Norman Osborne is emotionally- destructive and tortured by his other personality, Green Goblin. This Green Goblin is freaking scary, yet funny villain that hasn't yet been topped. (Well, Heath Ledger did.) The Love story is original and better than the new one. In this, Peter keeps himself a mystery from Mary Jane, yet is still her emotional comfort who is always there. The new one is just him getting the girl right away and developing chemistry. The hero doesn't get the girl in this? That is originality. This movie is also very unforgettable.Tobey is so much better than Garf-cat. For one, he doesn't have a stupid haircut. For another, he is smart, but the whole movie isn't just Peter doing science experiments and trying to find out about his parents. Peter is also more muscular and looks like a superhero type, while Garfield is just skin and bones. Peter is developed so well in this, we feel his exact moods. Garfield's weren't bad, but not good.

And as we would expect the picture and sound are perfect. De Niro won the Oscar for Best Actor and it is easy to understand why.How this movie came about is just as interesting as the movie itself. De Niro is a boxing fan and after reading Lamotta's book figured it would make a good movie. Scorsese was NOT a boxing fan and resisted. But Scorsese was also having personal issues, with drugs, and Di Niro's visit to him in the hospital in 1978, urging him to get himself clean, and also to make the movie. Scorsese did and credits Di Niro with saving his life. Also, in preparation for the role Di Niro trained as a boxer and actually won 2 of the 3 boxing matches he participated in. And for the later life of Lamotta gained a reported 60 pounds. Since the movie is based on Lamotta's book, and Scorsese works hard to make accurate movies based on real people, the story we see, of a paranoid and jealous Lamotta, is probably very accurate. But upon seeing the movie and Lamotta asking his former wife if he was really like that, her response was You were worse.he got the name Raging Bull for his fighting style, just getting low and barging in and beating up opponents. But as we see the story of his life there always was a rage inside of him. Because of his paranoia and jealousy he had no good relationships, both his wife and his brother had to leave him to escape his wrath.Robert De Niro of course is Jake La Motta and the story starts in 1941 when he was a young fighter just about 20. He meets his eventual second wife, Cathy Moriarty who plays Vickie La Motta, when she was just 15 and they married a year later. It was a bit disconcerting because Moriarty looked much older even though she in fact was still a teenager when filming.And Joe Pesci, still a relative unknown, is remarkably good as the brother and business manager, Joey Lamotta, until Jake's rage drove him to estrangement.The fight scenes are recreated very believably, and in the late 1950s after his boxing career came to an end Lamotta became an entertainer of sorts, usually a comedian in night spots and bars.

He has hooks and is pretty versatile with them. Unfortunately in small town USA, people are not as forgiving and easily shocked. His mom sobs that her son is so crippled. His girlfriend actually doesn't mind, but he's too much feeling sorry for himself to notice. This character was hard for me to like, wallowing in self-pity. He did finally snap out of it, though.  Finally we have an older guy who is returning to his wife and kids. The wife is played well by Myrna Loy (of Thin Man fame) and her comedic style pops out once in awhile as she plays a straight part. Her daughter falls in love with the airman with the blonde floozy and swears she will break up the marriage and take him for herself. Who are you, God? intones her father. ABottom Line Interesting story on how each man deals with family and how things have changed since they shipped out. Acclimating to a new life is hard, and going into denial through alcohol or wallowing in self-pity just don't work. One of a kind film.Features Interviews with two actresses, elderly now, express a lot of what was going on with the set, the director and the actors. Quite entertaining.

I guess it has something to do with how it all mixes the superb acting, the almost-strange-but-beautiful camera shots, the haunting music. I would argue that it makes the film as a whole haunting.Do not miss this movie.
