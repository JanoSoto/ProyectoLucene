I can remember turning my sofa into a gump and building tik tok out of bottles and cans.unfortunatley, the movie we had some how either got lost or taped over and became only a memory. But one day many years later I found it in a store in the half price rack. I took it home and for the first time saw the movie in its entirety. being alot older, I understood it alot better than I had when I was a little kid.It wasn't till I showed it to my younger cousins that I realized that some of this movie is quite frightening.I would sit and watch them continuously hide there eyes from mombi and the other creators that now inhabited oz. we didn't even make it to the nome kings mountain.although, this movie is very dark, me only realizing it now, you have to remember that all the oz books were very dark. If you have ever read the wizard of oz you would see that it is full of blood and gore. You have a man that continuosly chops of his body parts, a house smashing a person, trees that have faces have all their limbs choped off and shake in pain,  and cat has his head choped off, and on and on. The 39' classic musical, even though a butifully written wonderful adaption to the idea of oz, it in no way comes close to the actual story. This movie, however, captures, as best as possible, ozma of oz and the land of oz the way they are in the book. If you did read the books you would see that there is no place for singing and dancing.as for the inconsitancies in the movie with the wizard of oz, I do remember being a little confused but just kind of dismissing it because the movie was so enchanting. But, I think the makers put the allusions to the first movie there because they had to. other wise no one would have payed any atttention to it wasn't  in some way a sequel. Disney, although very aragunt and full of themselves, probably realized that they had no business going back and remaking the wizard of oz because it is such a beloved classic. If they had, no one would have cared to see it no matter how good it was. But on the other hand they couldn't very well go and make a 1930's style musical in 1985 to try and sequel the old one. so, they took the logical step they collaborated. In fact that is what the whole script is, a big collaboration of old ideas and new ideas. you have the next two books in the oz series pushed together, some of the plot twists and repeating characters from the  old movie pushed in, and then they made the thing alot more realistic and believable (something the makers of the first movie never bothered to do) and you have return to oz. Basically, what I'm trying to say is that you can't go remake the old movie and you can't make a sequel for something that dosn't have a prequel so they had to go back to the original the makers where tied to it no matter what they did. Instead of comparing the two, let them both stand alone as different movies from different eras in different genres.I think this movie is a masterpeice and shall let my kids watch it when I have kids. and if you don't agree, then you obviously really have no idea what Oz is really all about.

Reviewers have pointed out the film's debt to Hitchcock - why do people always call films which 'borrow' the superficials  (plot, music, characters, set-pieces etc.) Hitchcockian, when his true inheritors are directors like Godard and Marker? - but his oeuvre only contains two notable films about marriage, 'The Man who knew too much' and 'The Wrong Man'.  These films show marriage cracking under the strain of some exterior threat.'Harry' begins with a marriage already at crisis point - symbolically confined in an old car without air conditioning, driving towards a delapidated country house, young children bawling, mother unable to do anything, father getting increasingly frustrated, all seat-belted for greater entrapment.  I remember it well.  Laurent Lucas is the new Francois Cluzot, the grim, unhappy, modern man conspired against by circumstances that are not melodramatic, but everyday; financial, parents, frustrated ambitions etc.If this is Hitchcock, it is a French version as mediated by Chabrol - there is the same contrast between the artificiality  of the plot and the natural surroundings that stage it.  This opening of a car, a family, classical music, the drive to a summer retreat, the intrusions of two strangers, remind me of another recent European thriller, Haneke's 'Funny Games'.The film borrows from a lot of Hitchcockian sources - 'The Man who knew too much', 'Vertigo', 'Psycho', 'The Trouble with Harry' (in reverse), especially 'Strangers on a train' - Harry's character is sometimes more Highsmith than Hitchcock, a mixture of Tom Ripley and Dickie (here it is the rich man who wants to belong with the less well-off).The meeting of Michel and Harry is signalled with HItchcockian criss-cross; ominously, in a public lavatory.  There is a sense of magic or fairy tale here, as the two characters and their reflections reunite and fragment at the same time, suggesting a transformation scene, a switching of personalities and identities.  It is at the moment when Michel feels most exasperation (and the need for gender security, in the male toilets) that Harry turns up, suggesting that he is Michel's double, an expression of his unconscious desires, somebody who will do what he wouldn't dare.  This is the 'transference of guilt' narrative beloved of Hitchcock, one which found its purest expression in 'STrangers'.There are some reasons why this contrivance does not carry the same weight here.  Firstly, both characters are unpleasant and unlikely to win much audience support - 'STrangers' is so disturbing because the good guy is so cold, ruthless and unsympathetic, while the baddie seems vulnerable, and his motives are comprehensible.  There are occasional attempts to suggest Harry's demons, as he screams in silence like a Francis Bacon painting. Michel, while never likable, is not calculating enough to provide an effective contrast.  This blunts the transference of guilt - it is his wife, Claire, who resents his parents, who wishes for a bigger car etc.  She also bears the film's misogyny, perhaps Hitchcockian, as she shows no sympathy towards her husband's creative endeavours (an attempt to regain childhood?), but as this only surfaces in the last ten minutes, it denies the plot frisson.In the half-century since 'STrangers', Moll is still coy about homosexuality; although he never shows the much-alluded to heterosexual act, and engineers a number of encounters where a near-naked Harry and Michel discuss sexual prowess (to the point where Harry's eggs of virility become agent of Michel's creative fertility), there is no real sexual charge between them, making Harry look like a pervert trying to destroy the family, rather than showing a family stifling such urges in Michel.  Hitchcock is more sympathetic to his lonely gays.  He is also superior at creating narrative and suspense - Moll never makes his contrivances seem inevitable or plausible as his Master does, and after half an hour his film is slow-burning without becoming tense or exciting.

Bloated and pretentious, it is like an oversized car that grinds to a halt, spurting occasionally into movement.  Though humourless and cynical, it is an epic farce; epic because of the Western backdrop against which it is played; farce, because the whole project seems ready to collapse under its own earnestness, characters come and go unexpectedly, there's a lot of going in and out of doorways, the action shifts between distances thousands of miles apart, and yet the same characters seem to recongregate, as if some great big hand is moving the delf along a table.  I'm not able to tell whether 'Way of the Gun' is absurdly complex or foolishly simple.  The major problem is the screenplay, which seems desperate to remind us of the plot's metaphysical depth, when, as Keaton and Melville have taught us, action is eloquent enough on its own. Some have seen the film as a denunciation of violent cinema, cool macho gangster nihilism, as the sterile, masturbatory crooks (the chief of whom can't even have a baby with his wife) is contrasted with the simple values of maternity and fertility - when the enviably calm 'bagman' Joe Sarno walks in on Robin in labour, he seems momentarily struck with awe.  He is the only character at the end not tainted by blood - after all, he is the cleaner - and McQuarrie doesn't seem to be making much distinction between the blood of a bursting mother and the wounds of a bunch of gunmen.If the screenplay never transcends its own gaze, we can always concentrate of McQuarrie's directorial style.  Some have compared the film to 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' (the narrator gives himself and his accomplice the real-life surnames of the outlaws), but 'The Wild Bunch' is as good a starting point as any - the alternation of thunderous gunfights with an unearthly calm; the dead-end masculinity; the ritual finale (when Parker jumps into the dry fountain full of broken beer bottles - ouch!); the rare feel for landscape and architecture.  The long central sequence in Mexico, where the plot overload seems to stand still, is a familiar Peckinpah device, as the men rejuvenate, take stock, reflect, although actual Mexicans are conspicuously sparse.  Peckinpah was very much influenced by 'The Treasure of Sierra Madre', and like most Huston films, 'Way' is a hymn to failure.  What's surprising, though, for such a self-regarding wordsmith, is what a great action director McQuarrie is.  The gunfights here are truly visceral, very 1970s, exciting and full of crackling guns, the best since 'Heat', and showing most Hollywood action thrillers up for the cartoons they are.  The opening fight outside the concert is like a diabolic inversion of 'Grease', while the 'Battleship Potemkin' parody getaway with the pregnant Robin is extraordinary.  As is the way the cold modernist sheen a la 'Claire Dolan' gives onto the old-fashioned dustiness of a Western.  The music is terrific too, alternating melodramatic squalls of 'Usual Suspects'-like dread, with thrilling castanetas, as if the whole film is just one big corrida.
