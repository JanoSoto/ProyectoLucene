[{"date":"17 March 2008","score":"","review":" I just read a review of Can't Hardly Wait on the IMDb by a user who mentioned that he has walked by the movie in his local video store countless times before finally renting it. Personally, I saw it countless times when it was released because I worked at a video store at the time, but it is probably the one movie that I have been meaning to write a review about since I started writing reviews on the IMDb nearly ten years ago. The teen comedies, especially the ones that use losing virginity as major plot devices, are an intolerable lot almost without exception. This one, however, is definitely an exception. Everything is blown out of proportion from what high school is really like (and I went to a ridiculously rich high school, so I know what it's like to party in multi-million dollar mansions while the parents (someone else's, of course) are away), but it's blown out of proportion in all the right ways. It's hard to pinpoint what it is that makes this movie work while so many other movies like it fail completely, because it does have a lot of the same flaws. Granted, I should be a little careful, because I haven't seen the movie in at least six years and it's dangerous to review a movie I haven't seen for that long (the movies that I thought were cool when I was in high school are now sometimes shockingly bad), but while this is certainly not a family movie or a critic's movie, for its target audience it can definitely serve as some pretty good fun.It's true that Can't Hardly Wait doesn't remotely approach the honesty and importance of the classic high school films, like Say Anything or The Breakfast Club, and it's also true that most of the characters (almost all, in fact) are comic caricatures of the traditional high school types, but the movie never pretends to be anything more than that. I think it understands that it's a joke, and so it just has fun with itself, and with the right state of mind we can have a blast along with it.Seth Green is the white kid who thinks he's black, and he pulls off the accent and the behavior remarkably well. So well, in fact, that for a while I thought he might be typecast like Sean Penn was for a while by Fast Times (another classic) and Keanu Reeves was by Bill & Ted (Keanu had a much harder time shaking that image, but he has definitely done it by now. Peter Facinelli is good as Mike Dexter (his most memorable role before or since), the cool kid with the hot girlfriend who has an agreement with his friends to break up with their high school girlfriends so they can graduate to college women. Unfortunately, he's the only one who goes through with it, and thus enters poor Jennifer Love Hewitt, who mopes and moans through most of her role, one of the only boring and totally uninteresting parts of the movie. Even her goofy future-sorority-girl girlfriends are more entertaining. Then again, Hewitt's character, as it is, doesn't belong in this movie, she belongs in a movie that takes itself a little more seriously, and even then she should be played by someone else. But the real highlight is Charlie Korsmo as William Lichter, the geeky kid trying desperately with his Star Wars buddies to get into a cool party and sabotage it. While his buddies wait on the roof acting out their favorite Star Wars scenes, William proceeds to get drunk and ultimately give us the best scene in the movie, a heroic live performance of Guns N' Roses' Paradise City in front of the whole party, who finally begin to see him in a new light. Strangely, Korsmo hasn't acted since this movie.There is another character named Denise Fleming who spends most of the movie locked in a bathroom with Kenny Fisher (Seth Green), with whom she used to be close friends until he became, as they say, too cool for her. Their conversation is the most realistic and heartwarming thing in the movie, it's always been confusing to me why the writers locked her in a bathroom for the whole movie. Probably to give her and Kenny enough time to have their heart-to-heart chat, etc.It's easy to badmouth a movie like this. It has many of the stereotypes of your typical high school comedy, and the situations and the structure that the writers have created are often ludicrous in the extreme. The movie's target audience may not be as big as the truly successful coming of age films, but the target audience is richly rewarded with this movie. It's about 100 times better than American Pie, for example. Unlike that movie, there are no cringe-inducing scenes, no stomach-turning toilet humor, and no conspicuously shaped holes in any apple pies. This movie is just good fun!

It is certainly not this flick! Ryan Reynolds stars as a party animal who has attended college for seven years doing nothing more than milking the system by organizing wild parties, excessive drinking, and having sex. The substance and content of this film could fit on a postage stamp. Very few of the jokes are funny, unless you enjoy the crudest, raunchiest humor imaginable. (Such as having a severe bathroom attack during an exam.) But this content has only been done 10001 times before.I did move my original thought of giving this film one star to three. In the later stages of the movie, Ryan's character tries to give the film a mild serious tone when he gives his speech to the review board about why he should be allowed to stay in school after his father cuts off his funding. But this moment is the only bright spot in the film. There is no identity for Ryan's character to show any serious side to him. By the time you see him taking any exams, the clips come and go so fast that you wish the movie would end. The late Paul Gleason, who so brilliantly played the disciplinarian Dick Vernon in The Breakfast Club, is SHAMEFULLY cast as an Economics professor who supposedly has confidence in Van, but we don't see that until the very end. Van doesn't even do all that much to make any professor care. I hope Mr. Gleason was well paid for this junk.The supporting roles are so superficial, that they take on the life of a department store mannequin. Adults are presented as two-dimensional nincompoops where the kid and his girlfriend succeed because, Ohhh They are so cute\/cool! NOT! If your about 14 or under, you might like this crap. The R-rating, because of the sexual innuendo, draws under-age kids to movies like this. But for the rest of us, your time and money is better spent elsewhere.

Plenty others have, so I'll just try to tether the following comments to the personal and at-times parallel odyssey of this particular user.Some years before its premiere a grade-school librarian had the good taste and uncommon foresight to round up select classes, seat them in the library or small auditorium, gently command their collective attention and silence, hand out papers with colored pencils or crayons, set a vinyl LP or two of highbrow music on a mono phonograph, and say, Draw! (What? Anything.)Months before the premiere an assigned middle-school reader included Arthur C. Clarke's short story, The Sentinel, which inspired me to visit the local public library and ask if Mister Clarke had written anything else, prompting the on-duty librarian to point to a bookshelf and a half.I'd asked my parents to take me to the first-run in my hometown, shown on a decidedly non-Cinerama screen. Towards the end my mother was asleep on my left shoulder and my father asleep on my right. I could well have been the only person besides the projectionist awake in the theater (well, perhaps not), and the appearance of the Star Child very nearly scared the marmalade out of me, but not so badly that I'd want to awake my parents or anyone else. And then, quite suddenly, I GOT that closing shot, and the opening one, and a lot of everything in between.Haven't been quite the same since. I view 2001 to this day, and it remains the movie I've seen the most times in a theater, or in any other format. I quote lines from it at home and (quite fittingly) at the workplace.

Though we'd already seen grand ideas, actual spacefarers had nothing roomier than a first-generation Soyuz capsule. The only ET to date was a BEM or bear that wore makeup. The Bell System would last forever (and might yet).

Marisa Tomei, probably unknowingly, outmatches herself and delivers the most charming role of her life. I am not saying it's the most masterful. I am not saying it's the most complicated. But charming, oh yes it is! Oh yes it is! At some points of time, when you feel all one with this film, you feel like you can breathe in the air with countless love pollens in it, drive through the long old roads with a view of the ocean, the ocean wind blowing your hair and nourishing your senses under the golden sun and making you believe, anything is possible in a place like this.This film has very simple elements that get into your veins and stay with you for the rest of your life. A lot of people worked so hard to make dead complicated plots and acting scopes. But I remembered none of those like I remember Only You. If you have never loved, never felt silly and thought you could give away your everything, never felt sad and wished you could just melt away with the sweet earth, or if you have forgotten how those feelings were because you felt them so long ago, then probably you might find Only You not worth losing sleep over. But for a true romantique, this is all there is, this is all there can be.A pure delight for the senses. A life altering experience to me. I have watched it a hundred times over.

Marisa Tomei, probably unknowingly, outmatches herself and delivers the most charming role of her life. I am not saying it's the most masterful. I am not saying it's the most complicated. But charming, oh yes it is! Oh yes it is! At some points of time, when you feel all one with this film, you feel like you can breathe in the air with countless love pollens in it, drive through the long old roads with a view of the ocean, the ocean wind blowing your hair and nourishing your senses under the golden sun and making you believe, anything is possible in a place like this.This film has very simple elements that get into your veins and stay with you for the rest of your life. A lot of people worked so hard to make dead complicated plots and acting scopes. But I remembered none of those like I remember Only You. If you have never loved, never felt silly and thought you could give away your everything, never felt sad and wished you could just melt away with the sweet earth, or if you have forgotten how those feelings were because you felt them so long ago, then probably you might find Only You not worth losing sleep over. But for a true romantique, this is all there is, this is all there can be.A pure delight for the senses. A life altering experience to me. I have watched it a hundred times over.

She wrote pretty much what I wanted to write, so now I will have to rephrase.Giving a movie 10 rating reflects impractical thinking, in some people's opinion. I say, when your heart is full, 10 seems to be too low! Sometimes you feel so overwhelmed, you think, Gee, why can I not give 11 in 10? It happened to me when I watched the ending of A Very Long Engagement. And it happened when I watched Only You.It is not necessary to be in love with Italy to appreciate this film.

I suppose cinematic personality can be expressed in a variety of ways, but I value it most when its from a filmmaker, and it affects the cinematic vocabulary. I like Altman. Yes, I like certain films of his these stand on their own outside of the long term dialog I've had with him.But I like the dialog as well, that long languid experience of punctuated experiments in his worlds and then mine.What he does, where his core experiments are rooted is in the rhythm of how he puts his films together. Its unlike anything else that could be considered competently relevant in film. His interest is in the notion of discovered pace.To understand why this is so weird, and sometimes so unsettling, you have to understand that there are very strict conventions in the business about what viewers will accept in terms of the pace, arc and rhythm of a film. Editors and filmmakers learn these conventions either through understanding the theory, through intuition or experience, depending on their approach. Its very, very narrow, what these allow.Regular readers of my comment know I believe that TeeVee is one of the worst evils we face. It is because it forces this vocabulary to be ever more narrow, constriction the visual imagination of a whole planet.Altman is a sort of Moses in this environment, trying every escape he can imagine. He tries to let actors surprise the camaraman and editor. He tries strange overlaps in scenes. He tries all sorts of parallel narratives. He particularly likes to juggle several layers of the narrative at once with contradictory, even warring cadences.Here what he does is work with three rhythms. The first is the obvious one, jazz, and particularly the style originating in Kansas City.The style can be directly attributable to the type of political corruption that dominated the town, extreme even when compared to Chicago and St Louis. The corruption is based on a sort of lie that pretends to be the truth but is bent. You can see it here in the voting. In Chicago at this time there would be no pretense dead people's ballots would simply appear in the ballot box without the show of hiring bodies to cast them. Blacks would simply be ignored at best without the church performing nominal help (and then lynching). (This church-influenced near-truth politics still dominates the town, even famously to the court system. You do not want a trial in Kansas City.)So we have the jazz playing, and influencing the action while political power and helping a 14 year old pregnant black girl are suspended. Its a particular trading of phrases that if you listen you can see reflected in the structure particularly the twisted flash-forwards of the narrative arrangement.Then you have the characters of the two women, each with their own world-rhythms. The character played by Jason Leigh is typical of what she can do personality-wise. Here it actually matters because of the way she pushes the future with the way she shapes words with an aggressive mouth. There's much to say here in the story about how this is folded into a similar character-induced pacing devised by Jean Harlow, who Leigh's character emulates. Harlow was in fact from Kansas City and her style was self-consciously KC jazz- influenced.The other character is played by Miranda Richardson, who (unlike her sister) had at the time a reputation for stiff English types. Here she plays something like that, one of those third generation frontier types with corn aristocracy, now turned vapid from drugs. Its a pretty layered performance, every big as complex as Leigh's. She also has a sort of nonlinear time based on rewriting and scrambling.Its an amazing construction, a thrilling experiment. By design, it lacks the sort of pace you come to expect. That's the point.

During her stay in Rome, she becomes sick of her routine and sneaks out of her hotel - unfortunately while under the influence of a sedative. Ne'er-do-well American journalist Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck) accidentally comes across Ann and after realizing who she is, enlists photographer buddy Irving Radovich (Eddie Albert) to give her a tour of Rome while covertly creating a big news story around her. Exploring Rome and avoiding detection from the police, Ann and Joe fall for each other - but both are forced to face up to their respective duties in the end.The charms of Roman Holiday have been described a million times over, and undoubtedly better than I possibly could. The leads are utterly charming and lovable, the Roman scenery is gorgeous, the story is a wonderfully enjoyable fantasy, the humor is slight and unsophisticated yet remains charming and funny. For sheer enjoyment, it's hard to find a better film, which proves arguably the greatest romantic comedy of all time.The film largely succeeds on the petite shoulders of Audrey Hepburn, only 23 when this film came out. Having appeared in bit roles in a number of British films (check out her walk-on in The Lavender Hill Mob with Alec Guinness and Stanley Holloway) and as the star of the Broadway show Gigi, Hepburn was on the verge of stardom already. But this film catapulted her over the top, and Hepburn immediately became one of Hollywood's most recognizable and popular icons - a superstar of the type rarely seen today.Audrey Hepburn is simply adorable as Princess Ann, the spoiled, sheltered European princess who wants to enjoy the simple pleasures of life - having a gellato, attending a dance, getting a haircut, riding a Vespa through the streets of Rome. Audrey has a perfect combination of innocence, beauty and insouciance in this role; she seems like a petulant child, but is so lovable and sweet it's impossible to hold it against her. And certainly, by the end of the film, Ann comes to realize the importance of her role as a Princess. The scene where Ann stands up to her scolding minders shows a much stronger and deeper character than we could have guessed from her early scenes.Audrey Hepburn's status as an icon, of fashion, class, grace, beauty, and humanitarianism cannot be overstated. Audrey is a timeless symbol of femininity who is much more relate-able to the average girl than, say, Marilyn Monroe or Sophia Loren. Millions of girls worldwide aspire to be Audrey Hepburn, because she made being a slim, small, shy girl - qualities usually frowned upon in Hollywood and the media - something desirable. Marilyn might be more overtly sexual, but Audrey's screen persona is a believable real woman with relate-able personality and desires. She may not be the most versatile actress in Hollywood history, but she was one of the most honest and lovable. And here, in her first major film role, Audrey showcases why.Gregory Peck is also charming. I'm not inordinately fond of Peck, who even is best roles comes across as a bit stiff, but he is perfect for this role. Joe Bradley is convincing in all of his guises a lovable, self-serving rogue, Anna's learned protector, and the honest, love-stricken man unwilling to betray the girl he loves. It's one of Peck's best roles, and he pulls it off beautifully.Eddie Albert as Peck's photographer buddy, Hartley Power as his flustered boss, and Margaret Rawlngs as Anna's stern minder turn in effective supporting performances which add to the film as well.Roman Holiday is just a classic film. Its status as an icon of cinema is well-deserved, and only the most bitter, mean-spirited cynic could possibly dislike it.9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"17 March 2008","score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Princess Ann (Audrey Hepburn) is the beautiful heiress to an Eastern European country who is on a goodwill tour of Europe.

But this film catapulted her over the top, and Hepburn immediately became one of Hollywood's most recognizable and popular icons - a superstar of the type rarely seen today.Audrey Hepburn is simply adorable as Princess Ann, the spoiled, sheltered European princess who wants to enjoy the simple pleasures of life - having a gellato, attending a dance, getting a haircut, riding a Vespa through the streets of Rome. Audrey has a perfect combination of innocence, beauty and insouciance in this role; she seems like a petulant child, but is so lovable and sweet it's impossible to hold it against her. And certainly, by the end of the film, Ann comes to realize the importance of her role as a Princess. The scene where Ann stands up to her scolding minders shows a much stronger and deeper character than we could have guessed from her early scenes.Audrey Hepburn's status as an icon, of fashion, class, grace, beauty, and humanitarianism cannot be overstated. Audrey is a timeless symbol of femininity who is much more relate-able to the average girl than, say, Marilyn Monroe or Sophia Loren. Millions of girls worldwide aspire to be Audrey Hepburn, because she made being a slim, small, shy girl - qualities usually frowned upon in Hollywood and the media - something desirable. Marilyn might be more overtly sexual, but Audrey's screen persona is a believable real woman with relate-able personality and desires. She may not be the most versatile actress in Hollywood history, but she was one of the most honest and lovable. And here, in her first major film role, Audrey showcases why.Gregory Peck is also charming. I'm not inordinately fond of Peck, who even is best roles comes across as a bit stiff, but he is perfect for this role. Joe Bradley is convincing in all of his guises a lovable, self-serving rogue, Anna's learned protector, and the honest, love-stricken man unwilling to betray the girl he loves. It's one of Peck's best roles, and he pulls it off beautifully.Eddie Albert as Peck's photographer buddy, Hartley Power as his flustered boss, and Margaret Rawlngs as Anna's stern minder turn in effective supporting performances which add to the film as well.Roman Holiday is just a classic film. Its status as an icon of cinema is well-deserved, and only the most bitter, mean-spirited cynic could possibly dislike it.9\/10 ","genre":"Comedy, Romance"},{"date":"17 March 2008","score":"2 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" I don't dislike The Shining. I just feel, as did King, that Kubrick's The Shining butchered his story and it does exactly that. I guess supposedly The Shining's artistic value is huge being that Kubrick is such a brilliant director but I don't see anything to the film that makes it such a Kubrick masterpiece. The core ideas are still in tact from the film but it seems as though Kubrick rushes everything through and in the process leaves all the meat and potatoes of the characters and the story in the dust. The characters in the film have virtually no depth, they are very shallow characters and the casting for the important roles couldn't have been more wrong. That being said Kubrick's The Shining makes a great horror story and is downright disturbing in numerous scenes. It gets a lot of it's classic status from many of it's more disturbing scenes including the blood in the elevator, REDRUM, the disturbing portrayal of Danny, and of course Nicholson's infamous portrayal of the madman but the problem with all of this is the story around it is so weak. You don't see Nicholson's decent into madness, it practically happens on a dime, and you don't get a sense of the evil hotel, everything just lumps together quickly, and the ending of the film makes such little sense that it leaves you frustrated and scratching your head.Jack Nicholson plays Jack Torrance. Nicholson is a master actor, even nearly thirty years ago he was brilliant on screen and although his performance and character doesn't really match that of the novel he is still a decent choice for Torrance. The problem is Kubrick doesn't give Nicholson any depth to his character at all. So he gets to show sane, and then completely insane with nothing in the middle. Still it's easy to see why Nicholson's performance is so memorable because he is terrific. Shelley Duvall might be one of the worst actresses I've ever seen and casting her in this role might be one of the worst decisions I've ever seen. She is god-awful in this role and not to be mean but MAN is she ugly...holy crap. She was nominated for a Razzie for this role and I usually hate the Razzie's but they were dead on for this performance. She doesn't come close to fulfilling King's novel version of Wendy and she's just terrible in the role. Her facial expressions and downright hilarious acting makes her performance really, really awful. In his one and only performance on the big screen Danny Lloyd plays young Danny Torrance with a certain mundaneness. I mean I give him enormous credit for the scenes where he's talking to Tony and his belting out REDRUM which still gives me nightmares but apparently Kubrick shielded him even knowing he was in a horror movie (which surprises me and I gain a little respect for Kubrick for doing that.) Still Lloyd's performance is just adequate, nothing really huge about it. Finally veteran actor Scatman Crothers plays Dick Hallorann in a small role that isn't even really a supporting role but that's what they consider it. He does alright but doesn't even come close to the terrific role played by Melvin Van Peebles in the King Mini series version. But then his role is very small and like with the other characters, Kubrick gives them nothing to work with.Apparently I'm not a Kubrick fan because if I could pin point one thing wrong with The Shining, it would sum up into Stanley Kubrick who wrote the script and directed the film. I mean the man was rumored to be a monster on set forcing hundreds of re-shoots and yet manages to get no depth to these amazing characters? He focused far too much on the horror aspect of The Shining and missed all of the key elements that makes it brilliant. The film is okay and mostly okay because of Nicholson's performance once he becomes the maniac, and the hedge maze idea is cool but NO substitution for the Hedge animals from the novel and the later mini series. Some people passionately love Kubrick's The Shining but I think it's a matter of feeling like they have to because if you really watch it from a King fan perspective you'll realize there is so much missing and you'll understand why King himself didn't like this version. Still it is a classic and very watchable (except for Duvall's horrendous performance) so definitely see it but read the book and watch King's version of the mini series as well because that will give you a true look into The Shining. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"17 March 2008","score":"2 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" I don't dislike The Shining.

People didn't actually take him seriously as a director until he walked away with the Oscar for Unforgiven, the first of two films that would net him an Academy Award for Best Director. And while that was in 1992, he'd been directing films 20 years before that.His directorial career began way back in 1971 with Play Misty For Me, a fairly modest but surprisingly confident debut for Clint. Especially considering it was his first time out in the director's chair.Play Misty For Me is Clint Eastwood's attempt to make a psychological thriller. Not that he has any interest in the inner workings of the psychotic mind. He's just made a film that comes with all the standard trappings. Nothing else.Clint has clearly studied up on his Hitchcock. All of what you'd expect from the genre are present and correct. The psycho looney. The hapless victims. Manipulative mind games. And the requisite (but surprisingly restrained) amount of gore. But he takes them, polishes them off and dishes them up as if they were all new again.Clint plays Dave Garland, a late night DJ. When a female fan, Evelyn Draper (Jessica Walter, superbly scary) calls in requesting he play Misty for her, the two of them get physical, up close and personal. But what was merely a one night stand for Dave was clearly something more for Evelyn. She calls him at all hours of the night. Pesters him frequently. And the more he shuns her, the more clingy and possessive of him she becomes. Becoming increasingly paranoid and vindictive, her obsession with Dave becomes more and more deranged, to the point of madness.Reading that paragraph, I'm sure Fatal Attraction must have occurred to you. In fact as you watch Play Misty For Me, you have to wonder why Clint didn't sue the makers of Fatal Attraction for blatant plagiarism. They have many similarities. Even an attempted suicide as a manipulation tactic. Yet oddly enough, Fatal Attraction was a huge hit and is widely known, while Play Misty For Me is the lesser known film even though it did the theme first.Oh well, that's audience's for you! Though Clint fills out the director's chair for the first time, even at this early stage he shows what a natural talent he is as a filmmaker. His direction is slick and involving. And surprisingly confident too, without a hint of pretension or self-doubt. Much like the man himself!He sets scenes up with lots of lovely little touches. Like an image of Clint and his girlfriend in the background. And the image of Evelyn's hand in the foreground, crushing a twig with it. And that's all before John Carpenter tried similar things with Halloween. He also performs lots of interesting little segues. With varying degrees of lighting. And some of the camera closeups are brilliantly inventive. Even oppressive. Like the closeup on Donna Mills eyes. She sees the cuts on Evelyn's wrists. She knows who Evelyn is, but keeps that to herself. The camera never pulls back. It instead has her voice off camera, acting naturally, telling us all we need to know. That's really quite enough.But as excellent as Eastwood's direction is, he doesn't seem quite as confident in front of the camera as he is behind it. I think I would have preferred if he had stayed in the director's chair, and cast someone else in the role of Dave. He never quite convinces as a smooth DJ, especially one who reads sensitive poetry out over the airwaves. He seems too awkward and restless as a romantic lead.But Jessica Walter is perfectly cast as Evelyn. Her presence lights up the whole film. She's clearly well versed in the psychology of stalker behaviour. Consumed by delusions of love for someone she's only known over the radio. When confronted by the reality, it shatters her illusions. Walter does a superb job alternating her behaviour. Seeming playful and coy one moment, and suddenly irrational and vindictive the next. Hidden away in her words are veiled insinuations. Like when she cuts her wrists, she knows the publicity could damage Dave's career since it took place in his house. Forcing him to remain with her. She communicates moods with the greatest of subtleties. Through a penetrating stare or a significant pause, we can see the calculation. We see how her mind works. Even her knock is intended to be annoying.And yet as nutty as Evelyn is, you do feel sympathy for her. You sense her loneliness. And her longing. Which is a good thing, because Clint is a little vague on the details. We know practically nothing about Evelyn. We don't even know her job. She's given such a curious lack of back story by the film, that if it weren't for Jessica Walter's impressive, embodied performance the woman would be a total blank.Fortunately, Walter is a good enough actress to make up for the fact her character is so oddly underdeveloped. She is always convincing in the role, and the scene where she menaces Donna Mills with a pair of scissors contains a classic lineI hope David likes what he sees when he gets here. Because that's what he's taking to Hell with him!The climax is good, even if it ends a little more abruptly than expected. Couldn't imagine the so-called thrillers of today trying that, but Play Misty For Me is still a quite excellent, attentive little thriller.

Oh, Westley and Buttercup were meant to be together.It starts out with a kid playing his video game--so retro--and his mom comes in and tells him that his grandfather is there to talk to him. He pinches his cheek, like always. This time his grandfather brings a story. The kid is reluctant at first, but eventually gives in. And thus begins the story within the story of The Princess Bride by S. Morgenstern. I think that's his name, but I'm not sure. We begin in the land of Floren, and our main characters, Buttercup and Westley, who she calls Farmboy. You know, Robin Wright (Penn) and Cary Elwes look really good together. Westley has mostly said As you wish to Buttercup when she asked him to do something. The grandfather continues by saying that when Westley said As you wish, what he meant was I love you. Isn't that nice? When Westley leaves, Buttercup gets told that he got kidnapped by the dread pirate Roberts and killed. To this the kid says, Murdered by pirates is good. Buttercup went to her room and says, I will never love again. You see through the movie she means it.5 years after that, she becomes betrothed to the prince Humperdinck--it's so stupid--and she's not very happy. When she goes out for a ride, 3 of the best characters ever show up Vizzini, Inigo Montoya, and Fezzik (Andre the Giant) who kidnap her. Right off the bat, they're funny.

I finally did it; it was everything I hoped for and more. Its now my favorite silent film (ahead of other classics like The General and Battleship Potemkin). Its a shame that several parts have been lost, but the newest restoration is still very coherent.The special effects and set designs are the most obvious strength. They are still impressive today. There is not a single moment of unconvincing or misplaced special effects. Many of the scenes left me in awe. The city models are incredible huge skyscrapers, a complex network of streets, grueling machinery. Everything was well thought out. To imagine that these designs were conceived 80 years ago and remain realistic is mind blowing.I also found the characters to be a strong point. Each one had a distinct personality and beliefs. Freder makes a good hero, Rotwang makes a good villain, Joh Frederson makes a believable city head, and Maria is a perfect woman. I grew attached to each of the characters, even the minor ones.The plot is also strong, even though the message seems disconnected from today's society. It still has a timeless theme that should be remembered. The story has many twists and turns, but manages to develop smoothly.Metropolis is the ultimate silent science fiction movie. Practically anyone will be impressed by the special effects and theme, if nothing else.

The little boys should have always been the main focus but it almost seemed like they were props. They were very rarely discussed in any other situation than the murder and I thought that did an injustice to their memory. The murder of an innocent, in my opinion is one of the most unforgivable crimes one can commit.That being said, I will not voice my opinion on their guilt or innocence on a movie site but I will say that their trial was a sham.... Give me a break. Besides other things and I won't go into too much detail The cops mysteriously losing evidence, not having any physical evidence to place them at the scene or having a motive, other than the satanic cult ritual theory; which has to be debunked because they couldn't prove any of them were satanists(I know someone will probably say something and no wiccan is not satanism).I think the true injustice is that IF these teens didn't murder those poor little boys the horrific murderers who did will be walking free forever and 3 Innocent kids and 6 Innocent families have to suffer, the boys who were murdered and the kids who were convicted of it. I'm not saying that they are Innocent but don't those men at least deserve a competent trial and legal defense? Those who argue they are guilty, what is another trial gonna do? If they are guilty they'll just go back to jail and if they're not maybe the real killers can be brought to justice.Overall I found this movie was an emotional one, and hard to watch, but for someone who has no previous knowledge of the case, like I was, it's worth watching and considering. There's one last thing as a mom I have to say; God rest those poor little boys.

Didn't he look like a noisy music channel sometimes ?, a very stupid quiz show for other times, and a long silly soap opera all the times ?!I think the final plot or statement which made (Carrey) as the avenger who takes revenge on that Homey electronic substitute for parents is such a solution for making a catchy climax only, because (Carrey) here personifies the substitute itself ! However with a much powerful disturbance, and the message is so clear  turn it off, or at least don't take it as a friend.(Ben Stiller) said at (Inside The Actor Studio) that Jim Carrey was coming to the set everyday with 20 ideas to perform one scene and he loved it. But for sometimes you'd feel that (Stiller), as a director, let (Carrey) do whatever he wants maybe as his creative colleague, or maybe as the bankable star of the time who took 20 million dollars for his role which was historically unprecedented at the time and too overrated from my point of view as well, putting in mind many ultra-silly moments and the fact that the movie's outcome at the box office wasn't quite good. I only loved that scene at the end when some man loses the TV transmission then begins to open a book with exploratory look on his face. It's very forthright I know (Books instead of trash TV) but nice and well-meaning.It's a devil-in-our-home kind of movie. Yet, not as a Horror spoof, inasmuch as a Horror only ! So what a noisy, brusque and too silly Horror that is !

I can't hear that Kenny Loggins title song and see those pairs of dancing feet during the opening credits without sitting down to watch this whole movie. And even if it's largely to make fun of it, I still love it for old times' sake.Kevin Bacon is the tough city kid stuck in some podunk Midwest town where dancing has been outlawed. John Lithgow is the preacher who serves as Bacon's arch nemesis; Lori Singer is the preacher's daughter who has a hankering for the new dangerous kid. Dianne Wiest is the reasonable mom who acts as referee between dad and daughter. The whole thing is sillier than an episode of Laugh-In, but many of the actors (particularly Lithgow, Wiest and Bacon) are good enough to actually sell the material. And come on, admit it, you know you like the music.Grade B+ ","genre":null},{"date":"17 March 2008","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Aw, come on IMDb'ers, why the low rating?

Blade Runner does have excellent production values, it does have a complex story and it does have a complicated way it deals with its plot threads. (Sometimes too much so) But what I really appreciated mainly about this movie was the hero's conflict with his mission. It's the type of character that is overlooked as one of the many inspirations from this film. Sure the film's pretty sets and tale of robots have inspired many low grade science fiction movies but without the conflicted hero the movie would have no purpose and no real anchor to drive home the film's message. Indeed the hero essayed by Harrison Ford is why I give this 4 stars, his burned out hero sharply contrasts the lights and atmosphere of the film. Without the hero's dim perception of his home this film would be just a work in special effects. That this contrast is made, as well as the hero's indifference to the life he lives compared to the replicants he hunts is what makes the movie the classic it is. So while others will find the sets amazing, the special effects breath-taking, I really found it to be the main character to what made this movie the classic it is. Also like the best science fiction, it's vague, dense and invites you to make your own interpretations as to what happened.* * * * out of 4-(Excellent, Must See) ","genre":null},{"date":"17 March 2008","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Harrison Ford stars as a replicant bounty hunter who the powers that be hire to terminate four replicants who have come to find their creator, along the way Ford discovers his purpose in life as well as some secrets and indeed his ideals start to blur.
