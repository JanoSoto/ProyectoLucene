A One hour and forty minute film yet it feels like only a fraction of that length. As the characters are already introduced to us, the movie immediately gets the ball rolling. I love how frantic and faced paced Part II is; the movie almost never pauses and is one hell of a thrill ride. How many movie sequels return to the events of the first film? I can't imagine the effort that went into recreating the scenes from the first film from different perspectives; it makes you see the first film in a whole different light. The film's portrayal of 2015 on the other hand is the future we all wish we could have, unlike most movies which predict a future of doom and gloom. I still want those self tying shoe laces and the pizza which can be cooked with a few seconds; its fun watching all those future gizmos. Although they got some things right; the large, flat, wide screen TV with multiple channels or the market for nostalgia with the Cafe 80's.Part II takes The Empire Strikes Back route by being darker than the first film; the alternate 1985 is like an even darker version of Its a Wonderful Life. Part II is Biff's movie; while he doesn't have the most complex personality, what makes him such a great character is all the different incarnations he has, from different ages, time lines as well as his relatives. Thomas F. Wilson has by far the juiciest role in the film, playing no less than five variations of the same character, and even having the young Biff interact with the old Biff. I find it funny that the universe could get destroyed just because this one guy has to be an asshole. Also, I'm not the first person to notice this, but it's dawned on me how much the alternate 1985 Biff looks like Donald Trump. If the first Back to the Future showed the good side of capitalism, this movie shows the bad side capitalism.Back to the Future Part II is one of the best examples I've seen of single actors playing multiple roles, and how they seamlessly have them appear side by side and interact with each other. It still makes me wonder how they did those effects. Today of course they would be achieved using CGI, but not back then; and that's part of the fun of these effects, on top of being cool to look at, you find yourself asking how did they do that?. Robert Zemeicks had just directed the technically challenging Who Framed Rodger Rabbit and then directed a film as complex as this followed by directing the third Back to the Future; someone had a busy set of years working. They also got a new actress for the role of Jennifer, and even then they manage to make the change in casting appear seamless.Part II is by far the most, and I do mean by far, the most complex of the trilogy, these movies seriously screw with your head if you think about them too much. For example, (presuming time travel exists) if you go to the future you can't actually meet your future self; as you skipped the intervening time period by travelling forward in time, your older self would not exist in that time line; instead you would find your loved ones mourning over the day you disappeared. Or how about when old Biff returns to the future after giving his younger self the almanac, should he not have returned the future which he changed? I'll admit the first time I saw it I found the plot a bit confusing; It took me a number of viewings until I finally figured out why the old Biff is in pain when he returns to 2015. I don't see these inaccuracies as a bad thing, if anything they strengthen our love for these films. Part of the fun of the trilogy is discussing the time travel mechanics and trying to find explanations for any possible inaccuracy. Also one other thing I've always wondered, why does Marty make no effort to protect the letter from the rain when his life depends on it?

It's one of the game-changing blockbuster movies, and watching it again an astonishing 22 years later, it's remarkable just how well the movie has aged. It's not quite the perfect experience I remember - those Spielberg-isms are now clear as day - but Jurassic Park's mixture of robotics and CGI blows most modern films away in terms of tension and pure spectacle.Eccentric millionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) approaches palaeontologist Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and his palaeobotanist partner Dr. Ellie Satler (Laura Dern) to join him on a journey to his newly built theme park. With the promise of a life-changing experience, the young-ish doctors cannot resist, so they journey to Isla Nublar, an island off the coast of Costa Rica, along with mathematician Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) and lawyer Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero). Upon arrival, they are greeted with the sight of a living, breathing brachiosaurus. Using the preserved dinosaur DNA extracted from mosquitoes preserved in tree sap, Hammond and his company have used cloning technology to birth a wide range of dinosaurs, including the terrifying tyrannosaurus rex and a group of velociraptors.With this revelation comes the debate of whether man creating life is ethical, or in this scenario, safe. The dangers quickly become apparent to the group of doctors, but they cannot restrain their curiosity and are whisked off on a tour of the park. So confident is Hammond in the safety of his park, he invites his grandchildren Tim (Joseph Mazzello) and Lex (Ariana Richards) to participate. However, disgruntled employee Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight) has cut a deal to sell dinosaur embryos to a corporate rival, and when a storm hits the park, he shuts down all the power in order gain access to the eggs.

Without a second thought for the consequences of his actions or the ethics of playing God, Hammond comes across as misguided, and too likable to be labelled a villain. Hammond aside, Jurassic Park makes no apologies for its thinly- written characters, as this is a film of visual spectacle after all.

The film pulls no punches and is often hard to watch, but is so powerful in it's message that it remains a classic film of the 1970's. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a complex film, about complex people misidentified as simple. Much like other modern protest films One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest applies to one societal problem, but can transcend its subject matter and represent more modern problems, making it truly timeless.Many films have approached the community aspect of human life, some attacking it some defending it, this film seems to do both at the same time. The film contains a major paradox, both criticizing those who shun people from society for their differences, while showing that community is part of the human way of life, and that even society's rejects need community. Most of the shots throughout the film are medium or close ups, which most likely represents what a close group the patients are. It's both tragic, brilliant, and heartwarming to see how a group of neglected and forgotten people can band together, when society turns its back on them.The most impressive aspect of the film is the treatment of the characters, which is most likely a representation of the time it came out. Many of the characters in this film are connected by the fact that they have mental health issues, and they are rejects, but the characters are all distinctly different characters, and not just stereotypes. The treatment of the characters is impressive in it's own right, because today critics would probably say that the film is insensitive, it's humor is occasionally a little crude, but it's the exact opposite, the characters are treated as normal human beings, which is the most equal way to treat any character in any film.The movie contains a very angry message pointed at the methods of treatment for the mentally ill, and is an extremely powerful, albeit a little hard to watch, because of it. Simply put as the film progresses we see all of these characters, go through the horrific treatment they were subjected to, all the while following one main character, Randle. By the end of the film the main character is a vehicle for the message being sent, as the story takes Randall, a broken man, and breaks him permanently. By the end the audience should realize that they have watched a film, exemplifying the tragedy of the failing system.In conclusion One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a powerful, social protest film that uses great characters to send it's message. Beautifully acted, tragic, and infinitely complex, its message transcends its subject matter and represent a tragedy of the system's ineptitude. It's also one of the few movies that can tackle such a tough subject with care, respect, and finesse, it's just in general a great film.

Everyone was crying out of a sequel and the team of Zemeckis\/Gale made two sequels back to back.However with Crispin Glover refusing to return as George McFly meant that the story for the BTTF II had to be drastically altered. They went in a complete different direction with just excerpts of Glover used from the original film as well as a double.BTTF II also replaces Marty's girlfriend with Elizabeth Shue and her role has been drastically reduced.BTTF ended with Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) taking Marty (Michael J Fox) and Jennifer to the future to sort out his kids. This time where they were going they did not need roads.Marty and the crew arrive in 21 October 2015. The day this review was written. At the time I saw this film in the cinema 2015 sure felt like a long time away and you really felt that there would be hover-boards and 3D holographic films. I guess Avatar was the nearest we got to it.Although Marty sorts out his offspring's future it also allows Biff Tannen to steal the DeLorean and a sports almanac and drastically change the time-line to a darker one. Marty and Doc have to go back to the 1955 and the setting for the original film to restore the original time-line.BTTF II is a fast paced film as it squeezes the plots of three movies in its running time. However by going for a darker alternative time-line some of the charm of the original film was lost which was largely maintained in the future scenes set in 2015. As Fox remarked when the film came out , they wanted the future to be largely optimistic.My biggest issue always was that sports almanac with all the results of sporting events going back 50 years was an awfully thin book. Was it a prototype Kindle?Fox and Lloyd have no problems reprising their roles and very much carry on from the original film. The only odd change of character being that Marty gets upset when someone calls him chicken when he refuses a challenge.Fox has fun playing multiple characters in the film, Lea Thompson also plays her character in different time-lines and Thomas F Wilson is nasty Biff whichever time-line he is in.The film is a rollicking good adventure and a sequel that is almost shoulder to shoulder with the original. Zemeckis and Gale went on a different direction than many people expected. This is no lazy cash grab sequel. Its a time travel adventure that stands on its own self lacing Nikes and stupendously finishes with the set up to a third film.However the film does miss Crispin Glover's offbeat George McFly.

Where we're going, we don't need roads. Directed by Robert Zemeckis, and written by Bob Gale; 'Back to the Future Part 2' has everything to make this time travel trip, really fun to watch. However, its mediocre excuse of a monomyth journey feels a bit less intense than the first movie. In my opinion, trying to save yourself, from disappearing, seem like, a bigger conflict, than trying to save your children from jail time. Adding this lame reason for them, to travel in time, once again, seem, like the studios wanting the creators to capitalizing on the once stand-alone film, even if they didn't want to. Honestly, did, Doc Emmet Brown (Christopher Lloyd) really need to take Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and his girlfriend, Jennifer Parker (Elizabeth Shue) to the future, in an attempt to save his identical son from trouble? It seems like it would be, more troublesome, than helpful, because if Marty and Jennifer disappear, even temporarily from 1985, then events in the future would change until they return. As such, the future Marty and Jennifer shouldn't be there, and nor should their Michael J Fox-alike offspring. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, most of their most pivotal story has clearly been done in the first movie. So, there wasn't much to work with, to launch this new adventure. However, the series a complications involving a sports almanac is by far, the best part of the film, but also the most stressful to understand. It's time-travel paradoxes like these that make the film, so-so confusing, compare to the first movie's story. Trying to understand the logical of all the time travel plot-holes, surrounding this, would take you out of the movie, and give you a headache. It's not worth it. Trust me. However, it's so thought-provoking in its science, that it's fun to debate, all the mind-blowing actions, later on. Just, not, when you're watching the movie, for the first time. Filmed back-to-back with its sequel, 1990's 'Back to the Future Part III'. The movie visuals effects are breath-taking. I love, how the film's version of 2015, looks like, something like World Fair 'visions of the future', exhibit. It has the right amount of 1980s nostalgia cheese mixed with Sci-Fiction elements to make it, fun to look at. On the other hand, the Hill Valley of alternative 1985 with its punk-rock dystopia look, wasn't much, different from the Hill Valley of the 1985. Maybe, more work, could had been done to make it, look so much wore-down. I do like, how the movie recall 1955, back into the plot as well. It's nice to see, the characters trying to avoid, their previous selves. For the most part, all the actors that return from the first movie, were great in their roles. Still, it's really hard to take, some of the actors, seriously, when they playing multi-roles. Honestly, are we supposed to believe that Michael J. Fox is also playing Marty's future daughter!? Come on! That's stretching the uncanny gene pool too much. Still, I like the chemistry between Michael J. Fox & Christopher Lloyd in this. Both show, this father\/son relationship that I love from these films. Thomas F. Wilson as Biff Tannen is amazing. He's one of my favorite villains of all-time. I like that Lea Thompson is back in this, but I wish, she had more to do, then wear- old make up. However, two actors from the first film, Crispin Glover and Claudia Wells, did not return. Claudia Wells didn't return as Jennifer, due to family issues. Glover didn't return, due to conflicts with the studios and the creators. His character, George McFly, was not only minimized in the plot, but was obscured and recreated with another actor. Another actors worth checking out in the film, are Elijah Woods, Flea, Jason Scott Lee, and Billy Zane. So look out for them. One thing that bother some people about this film is the Hoverboard hoax. Zemeckis once said that the hoverboards were real, yet not released to the public, due to parental complaints regarding safety. A number of people thought Zemeckis was telling the truth and requested them at toy stores at the time. While, as of this writing, hoverboards has yet to be invented. It's still, possible for it to come, within the next 10 years. Other aspects of the depiction of the future had not come to pass by 2015, but efforts were made to replicate the technology advances such as flying cars, and self-typing shoes. However, the film did correctly predict a number of technological and sociological changes that occurred by 2015, including the rise of ubiquitous cameras; unmanned drones for mundane tasks; flat panel, widescreen television sets mounted on walls with multiple channel viewing; video chat systems; hands-free video game systems; wearable technology; and head-mounted displays. Anyways, still synchronize your watches! If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88mph, you're gonna see some serious s***. While, this movie had great action scenes. The movie isn't my favorite, when it comes to that. The ending was a bit, anti-climax. However, one thing, I wish, the movie didn't show, at the first showings are previews of Back to the Future Part 3, coming soon at theaters. Thanks for no spoiler warning, Robert Zemeckis.

With no one to contact for help, Chuck must test his physical, emotional, and mental skills to survive on a deserted island until someone comes and finds him. In the process, he finds a volleyball in an undelivered FedEX package. After cutting his hand, he gives the ball a face using his bloody hand print and befriends the ball as a companion, and names it 'Wilson'.Robert Zemeckis blesses this film with an ingenious script and story telling, and Tom Hanks delivers an endearing performance as the main character.

How Tom Hanks' character develops is quite amazing and really moves the story along. As the story progresses, his body becomes thin, his grows an excessive amount of facial hair to where he resembles a cave man, and his meals are reduced to crabs and fish he catches in the sea. He also begins having verbal conversations with a volleyball as a way coping with his loneliness. While the pacing can get slow, the film always managing to keep the story alive and moving, and all this thanks to its captivating screenplay by William Broyles Jr. The film does each some emotional points towards the second half and has the potential of making viewers shed a few tears.

However, Munson believes his luck is about to change when he discovers there is a competition in Reno where first prize is $1,000,000. Due to his injury, Munson doesn't want to compete and by chance he stumbles across a shy Amish man called Ishmael (Randy Quaid) who shows a real talent for bowling. Believing that Ishmael is the perfect ticket to win the money, Munson befriends Ishmael and the two men set off on a journey that neither man is likely to forget.The Farrelly brothers show in this film (and with the original Dumb and Dumber film) that they could still make films that were funny and fairly good natured. Yes like Dumb and Dumber some of the humour is a bit crude (it's a Farrelly brothers after all), but for me most of the funny moments revolve around Ishmael's naivety when Munson pulls him into the 'real' world outside of his Amish community. It perhaps also helps that Randy Quaid gives an absolute stellar performance and does an excellent job at captivating this vulnerability. It does feel a bit mean-spirited at the start, but the bond and respect that develops between the two men is quite touching and the film has a lot more heart than I thought it would.The only minor issue I had with this film is that the narrative is a bit aimless and meandering. I got the impression that a lot of the scenes in the middle could have been edited and that the whole film could have been cut to around the 90 minute mark (which probably would have made it a bit more enjoyable). However, this is a minor quibble and Kingpin more than makes up for it with the big laughs that are on offer here. Randy Quaid was the star of the show here, but Harrelson and Murray were both excellent as well. The supporting cast were also good and Vanessa Angel looks great here.Kingpin plods and drags its heels at times, but it's a fine film with great performances, lots of heart and many very funny moments.

However, Munson believes his luck is about to change when he discovers there is a competition in Reno where first prize is $1,000,000. Due to his injury, Munson doesn't want to compete and by chance he stumbles across a shy Amish man called Ishmael (Randy Quaid) who shows a real talent for bowling. Believing that Ishmael is the perfect ticket to win the money, Munson befriends Ishmael and the two men set off on a journey that neither man is likely to forget.The Farrelly brothers show in this film (and with the original Dumb and Dumber film) that they could still make films that were funny and fairly good natured.

You need a dark chapter like Part II before you can have something more romantic and light hearted like Part III. I love the western setting, there's a certain innocence to it; it's classic in every sense of the word. There's monument valley, cowboys, Indians, a saloon as well as the atypical western music score. It's also fun to see Marty and Doc in a date much further back in time as well as seeing the images, quotes and motifs from the first film reapplied in the western setting. The film shows us Hill Valley during its early days, thus over the course of three films we get the entire history (and near future) of this town, making it a character onto itself, even if the western setting does raise the question about Hill Valley's geographical location. Part III is the Doc's movie, it gave his character a whole new dimension. His scientific ethics are challenged by falling in love for the first time. I don't think many people realise it but Doc Brown is a pretty dark character. He blew his family's fortune on inventions which don't work (at least until he invented time travel), and is ostracised from the rest of Hill Valley, so it's about time something finally went right in his life and he finds a love. Plus it's cute, two geeks falling in love who were previously separated by space and time. My only complaint with Part III (really my only complaint with any film in the trilogy) is that the film pulls the liar revelled, one of my most dreaded of movie clichés. We know the Doc and Clara are going to get back together towards the end of the movie, so do really need to have the movie abruptly stop for a period. But I'm more forgiving of it in this instance as their separation does contribute to the suspense during the film's finale, which is one of the highlights of the entire trilogy. The interactions between Marty and Doc are just as great as ever, even more so that they have to find a way to get the DeLoran up to 88 miles per hour with the technology available to them in 1885. Although I do have to ask is Doc not going against his principles at the end by creating another time machine, oh well, it's still a great ending. Back to the Future Part III is my least favourite of the series but I still love it. Unlike other film franchises the trilogy is done and dusted. It's not polluted with further sequels, prequels, remakes, reboots, re-whatevers, and hopefully it will stay that way.The End.

He blew his family's fortune on inventions which don't work (at least until he invented time travel), and is ostracised from the rest of Hill Valley, so it's about time something finally went right in his life and he finds a love. Plus it's cute, two geeks falling in love who were previously separated by space and time. My only complaint with Part III (really my only complaint with any film in the trilogy) is that the film pulls the liar revelled, one of my most dreaded of movie clichés. We know the Doc and Clara are going to get back together towards the end of the movie, so do really need to have the movie abruptly stop for a period. But I'm more forgiving of it in this instance as their separation does contribute to the suspense during the film's finale, which is one of the highlights of the entire trilogy. The interactions between Marty and Doc are just as great as ever, even more so that they have to find a way to get the DeLoran up to 88 miles per hour with the technology available to them in 1885. Although I do have to ask is Doc not going against his principles at the end by creating another time machine, oh well, it's still a great ending. Back to the Future Part III is my least favourite of the series but I still love it. Unlike other film franchises the trilogy is done and dusted. It's not polluted with further sequels, prequels, remakes, reboots, re-whatevers, and hopefully it will stay that way.The End.

You need a dark chapter like Part II before you can have something more romantic and light hearted like Part III. I love the western setting, there's a certain innocence to it; it's classic in every sense of the word. There's monument valley, cowboys, Indians, a saloon as well as the atypical western music score. It's also fun to see Marty and Doc in a date much further back in time as well as seeing the images, quotes and motifs from the first film reapplied in the western setting. The film shows us Hill Valley during its early days, thus over the course of three films we get the entire history (and near future) of this town, making it a character onto itself, even if the western setting does raise the question about Hill Valley's geographical location.

The child actors, Mary Badham and Phillip Alford, playing Scout and Jem, are terrific and take us along for their trip out of innocence.In my view, the most important thing about this movie is that it stands beautifully on the cusp of a key battle of ideas in the 60s-- the question of whether racism in any form is justifiable.

I'm almost certain this was actually Chuck Palahniuk's original idea in naming his book Fight Club weed out the narrow minded audience and speak to the people in search of something more. In any case, the action in the film is not representative of the story, it is more so used as a platform to relay some of the underlying messages. There is incredible depth behind this film and you need to look past some of its seemingly tasteless features to find it.Likewise, if this question is ever answered with a simple explanation, these people do not understand the film. The beauty of Fight Club is understanding that you cannot fully understand it. With hundreds of separate messages combined into one plot, there is no way to grasp the subject matter at hand. There are two forms of incomprehensible art art that is so poorly constructed that it's intentions are not properly relayed, and art that is so methodical that putting it into words will only destroy it's beauty. Fight Club is the latter. From solely a film point of view, the execution is fantastic. Being a devout Palahniuk fan and having read the book, I could not think of two actors who would have represented their characters better than Brad Pitt and Edward Norton. Not to mention, they had an incredible challenge on their hands in basically putting an entire film on their shoulders. The supporting cast mast have had about 30 lines of dialogue in total, meaning Pitt, Norton and Helena Bonham Carter needed to be extraordinary in order to create a successful movie, which they were. The filming was exceptional and Fincher's interpretation and display were the reason it turned into a classic. In my mind, Fincher's greatest accomplishment was his ability to astound a numb 1990's society.This film truly changed my outlook on many aspects of life. I know the film has different effects on different people, and some may not see it as life changing, but it is a must watch for everybody. Touching on a range of topics - corporate takeover, modern society's view of men, and mental instability just to name a few - it was truly transcendent.Palahniuk created the masterpiece, Fincher created a classic, and Pitt\/Norton created perfection. Watch this movie. ","genre":"Drama"}]
