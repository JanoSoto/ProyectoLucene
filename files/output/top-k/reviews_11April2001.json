I read some of the other user comments, and it seems as if this film has cast the same spell on some of them as well. I think it was mostly a combination of everything! First of all, Hope Davis is great, in anything. She is this beautiful woman and great actress who is so real and not sugar sweet.I loved the soundtrack that goes with this movie... the bossa nova south american music was really original and really added to it.I also loved all of the personal ad dating scenes. Even though some of the men were a little bit stereotypical, maybe some of them are really like that... Im sure there are a lot of creepy men out there that put in personal ads, especially the ones who put walking on the beach as a favorite thing to do.. I think i remember this from a movie, but some character said, if everyone likes to walk on the beach, how come you never see any of them out there? basically, people can be so fake and pretend they are someone else, so this movie captures that whole feeling.I especially love the main character, Erin, because she was very independent and didn't feel that she was only complete if she had a man. I don't find a lot of women that are like that in real life, so I really admired that her character for that. It's a great movie, with such a funny cameo by Philip Seymour Hoffman in the beginning (also a great actor---watch everything he has done, especially happiness!)I totally recommend this movie to anyone who is a bit jaded by love and the idea of soulmates, but who is also dangerously romantic---bad combo!!> ","genre":null},{"date":"11 April 2001","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  This movie is watched more than any in my collection.
