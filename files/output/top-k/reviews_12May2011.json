They suggested I see it, but told me nothing about the story line. If you watch the trailer before you see the movie, it's ruined. The trailer gives away the whole story. DON'T WATCH THE TRAILER BEFORE YOU SEE THE MOVIE. The opening sequence is brilliant. It gets you into the spirit of the movie immediately. From then on it's a roller coaster ride of highs and lows. It's a true thriller, but there's no blood and guts. I'm deliberately not giving you any details about the plot, or the characters, because that's the best way to see this movie - Uninformed. Please see it, you won't be disappointed. ","genre":null},{"date":"12 May 2011","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Arlington Road is a great movie.
