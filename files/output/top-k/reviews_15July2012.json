As such, please stop reading if you do not want knowledge of important plot elements of either of these films. Chinatown is a film that sneaks up on you and punches you in the face at the end. But it does it in such a way that -- for a moment -- you're not even sure what happened. Nicholson, Dunaway, and Huston play their parts brilliantly. It's truly painful to watch Evelyn fall from such a stoic person to a nervous wreck. All the while, she keeps you guessing. In fact most of the characters of this film keep you guessing in an Agatha Christie sort of way. Who's good, who's bad, who's crazy? It keeps shifting on subtle levels. The cinematography is excellent. Nice smooth camera shots and composition. Restrained use of camera motion. Nice editing and a suitable score. The pacing is also really good. Fast enough to keep a person's interest, but slow enough to show the lush locations and buildings. The only case in which I'd subtract marks is for the Chinatown location itself. Once Chinatown is shown, it's presented fairly flat and lacking in visual detail. After watching this film, I couldn't help but think of Blade Runner. Now I see the connections between the two films. Blade Runner owes quite a bit to Chinatown. In particular, Rick Deckard's interaction with Rachel. I can also see why Jeter's truly awful and inconsistent novelized sequel to Blade Runner (The Edge of Human) made sexual abuse references in regards to Rachel. However, dealing with the sudden shock of discovering that you're not human serves the purpose effectively enough. Adding on a borrowed element from another film on top of that is totally unnecessary. The tone of Chinatown and the visual style of the era that it is set in forms the basis of Blade Runner's world. 1940s future-noir is the look, and the tone is equally serious. This 'tone' is something that a great deal of modern films seem to lack. Both films hold true to their tone and mood consistently while presenting a story that could be applied to various eras. Before beginning to think that one film is copying another, consider that most art forms derive elements from earlier works. There's no question that Chinatown owes quite a bit to 1946's The Big Sleep. And I'm sure it continues on back beyond that point in film and novels. The key is how it's doneIn particular, if a writer or director has a new idea and is inspired by an existing film, then it's best if the new project be a unique world with new characters. In other words, not a sequel. In this case, Chinatown to Blade Runner. In cases such as this, scenes and characters can be similar. Even lines of dialogue can take on somewhat similar structure. However, if a sequel is to be shot then the rules change. The viewer is much more wary of sequels and prequels. Unfortunately, there has been a rash of sequels lately that recycle lines wholesale. To re-use general plot points is one thing (and to be done subtly -- if at all), but recycling lines is often the kiss of death for a sequel. ExamplesStrong SequelsAliens This film uses a plot structure that is very similar to that of Alien. However, it works because the two films are of different genres and the characters are unique enough between films. Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan In this case, there was an imperative to take the film in a different direction from the first. Hence this film is very different from Star Trek The Motion Picture. It represents a completely different story, totally different motivations, mood, and plot. The two films share little in common, except for the general universe in which they exist and the main cast of core characters. Ideally, this is how a sequel should be done. Note that it does remain consistent to the previously-established Star Trek universe. Star Wars The Empire Strikes Back Again, the film is unique from its predecessor. Furthermore, it falls into a slightly different sub-genre of film. The tone of Empire is much different than that of A New Hope and remains consistent throughout. Consistency is absolutely key to making any film a success. Hopefully modern directors can re-discover this concept. The screenplays are totally unique between the two films and there are no recycled lines of dialogue. I won't name sequels that are considered to be poorly done. I'm sure readers of IMDb reviews are well aware of many examples of sub-standard sequel and prequel films. Take a look at them closely and look for recycled lines, 'homage' scenes that are nearly carbon copies, blatantly re-used plot lines, weak and highly derivative stories, inconsistent treatment of firmly-established characters, and a lack of substance. All of this returns us to Chinatown. Here is a film that is packed with emotional substance. It's subtle yet strong. Chinatown owes its visual style and tone to the film noir era while presenting totally new material. The characters are multi-layered and difficult to strictly classify. It never tries too hard and there seem to be no absolutes in the film. And lastly -- and most importantly -- it ends exactly where it should. Perhaps the ending should be the starting point of any writer's work. It's what makes or breaks films with even the greatest level of potential.

So for the second time in my life, and considering my ever-growing experience watching fantastic pieces of work, was it any good? Hmmm sort of.What I would say immediately is that (believe it or not) Robocop is not really about a cyborg policeman. The film tries to relay a message so much bigger than the future of law enforcement. Paul Verhoeven and Ed Neumeier have gone on record to say as much. To be honest without their conformation the film does blatantly show this. Robocop is an attempt to expose America for what they think it is, money hungry. The film is bathed in images and dialogue which portrays a disgusting country that has lost its sense of pride. In my opinion, the best parts of the film involved key executives of Omnicorp, the villainous organisation that has its grip firmly on Detroit. The suits are portrayed as the school frat boys of business desperately wanting get ahead of the other in popularity and riches. The famous ED-209 scene in the board room is particularly important to show this. To this day it was still pretty scary to watch and incredibly violent, but what was interesting to see was how dumbed down the reactions were from the members of the board. I don't think this was a case of bad acting or direction, I think this was an intentional  move to show that to us it's a tragic death, to Omnicorp it's a set-back.I was also surprised by its attention to media brainwashing. Showing us news coverage and full screen commercials as if the movie has stopped for a break, suggesting WE need a break to here from their sponsors, like WE need a product fix. The catchphrase I'd buy that for a dollar is used so much over the course of the film that it becomes  embedded and never goes away. The affect works very well. I've talked quite a lot there about Robocop's intention as a social satire but what about the literal plot that most people remember the film for.Unfortunately in its literal sense, Robocop as a few flaws. Don't get me wrong, Murphy's transition from human to robot is great. The shots are well planned and gripping and Robocop himself looks amazing but it falls pretty flat by the lack of emotion shown by other characters. Murphy's so-called partner Lewis is so wooden that it's hard to believe that in such a short space of time that she has become emotionally involved in Robocop's problems. She is pretty forgettable to be honest.Another real problem with this film is that its action sequences to me are pretty dull.  I honestly don't think they pack any sort of punch to keep anyone interested and unfortunately the soundtrack is awful. Listening to the main theme that has become so iconic over the years made me feel a little embarrassed to the point where it can't really be taken seriously as an 18 certificate action flick. But having said that, Robocop has one of the most disturbing sequences in the history if film involving a vat of acid. It was a sequence that really disturbed me as a 5 year old boy and the affect has not worn away. It's so relevant to early David Cronenberg body horror images that it feels extremely out of place for a film of this nature.

The plot, on the other hand, relies on repeating the third act of the first film over again. But it has fun with it, so it's somewhat forgivable. But where the film really shines is in it's writing, especially with the one-liners, the long over-complicated speeches and warnings from Doc, and of course, Biff's screen door on a battleship line. While yes, the film is much weaker than the original, and it seems to take a little bit to get going, it's still a very visual sequel worth watching.

I have never seen a movie with this sort of plot before and as such I consider it to be incredibly unique and as such worth watching and considering, if only for a unique plot. Not only is the plot unique, but the main character, Phil (Bill Murry) grows and develops through the film as he tries to come to terms with what is happening to him.Phil is a weather man in a small television station in Pittsburg. He wants something better but all he is doing now is going up to a town which is the home of Groundhog Day, the day when Phil the Groundhog comes out of his home and if he sees his shadow then there will be six more weeks of winter. He hates the town and the day, even though festivities go on all night and all day, all he wants to do is get back to the city and hopefully move up in the world. He cannot get back though as a blizzard has moved in. He returns, goes to sleep and wakes up 600 Groundhog Day, and the day repeats itself, and continues to do so. There is no explanation as to why this happens, but one can assume that it is his rather self-serving attitude. He wants to get out of the town, but the town won't let him go.The existentialist element comes up as he is drinking at the bowling alley with some of the town drunks. He says to them, what would you do if everyday seems to be the same. This is literal where Phil is concerned, but the others see this as life. Groundhog Day is just a break in the monotony of everyday life. Get up, go to work, go home, go to sleep. Nothing changes. When he realises this he basically runs amok. To the guys he is with, this is serious, but Phil is testing the water, and sure enough, when he wakes up the day has started again, and nothing has leaked over from the previous day.At first this is fun, as he takes advantage of all the knowledge that he can accumulate and use against people, but he soon comes to realise how powerless he is where no matter what he does, he just simply cannot get his producer (Addie McDowel) to sleep with him. He knows everything about her, but the way he is, the sleaze, he simply cannot get what he wants from her. The Carpe Diem aspects come along here where he sees that he can seize the day, and he certainly does because he knows everything that happens, and by the end of the film, he can prevent almost all of the disasters from happening (almost all as he is powerless to prevent the death of the town drunk).As he goes through this one day, he soon comes to see how powerless he is. This is seen with his inability to get his producer to bed, and moreso, his inability to die. He tries everything but he always wakes up in the morning. Not only that, he cannot stop an old man from dying. He can save a kid, he can save a man from choking, and he can get a hesitant fiancée to marry her fiancé, but he cannot stop a man from dying of old age. No matter the advantage of knowing everything about everybody and everything that is going to happen in this one day, he is still human and he is powerless to stop death.This is the most humbling aspect of Phil, for he tries everything, but he always finds that by the end of the day this man is dead. He cannot stop it. He calls himself a god, but he knows that he is really a man.How does he get out of it? Well the movie does not really explain how. You know when, and I will not reveal that, but there is no reason why. There is no reason why it starts and no reason why it ends. What does happen is that he starts off as a slime, and ends as the most loving and caring man that anybody could know. The question is, what happens to him when he wakes up the next day? Now that he is out, how long does it take for him to return to his former self. One can see glimpses of his former self beginning to shine through that next day.

What seemed so dramatic back then, is really old hat now. Isn't Paul Newman's character 'Fast Eddie' rather obvious and one dimensional? We find out so little about him except for the fact that he's obsessed with making money and being 'top dog' in the seedy world he inhabits. This goes on ad infinitum. And of course, Sarah Packard, the wounded but insightful woman who attempts to steer Eddie away from his pointless existence, fails to make an impression on him until it's too late.I don't like films about 'sad sacks'. I've made this point in countless number of my reviews. It's as though the screenwriter is crying out for recognition 'you see, I'm really a genius for recognizing just how down and out my characters are.' We're all supposed to experience some kind of catharsis when there's a moment of insight. But the problem is that there's so little to the characters to begin with. Yes we 'get it' that Fast Eddie is a loser and that when he beats Minnesota Fats at the end, it's a pyrrhic victory since Sarah is now dead (by her own hands) and Bert points out that Eddie won't be playing in anymore high stakes pool games ever again. When a character's transformation is so predictable, as it is here with Eddie's 'punishment' for his lack of empathy and general cluelessness, why heap accolade upon accolade on a screenplay that doesn't deserve it? Further evidence of the screenwriters' ineptitude is the treatment of the antagonist, Bert, played by George C. Scott. Is there a more unlikeable antagonist than this? There's really nothing good about him from the '75% stake' to his wretched treatment of poor Sarah.

In short, they're charming and likable&#x97;the exact opposite the way Bert is depicted here. To their credit, Robert Rossen (who wrote the novel the film is based on) and the adapter, Sidney Carroll, manage to have the bad guys win out in the end, but their antagonist is so devoid of charm, that we can hardly believe any of it. Pull out your Sopranos DVDs if you want some verisimilitude.Plot-wise, 'The Hustler' is a slow-moving affair.

Sometimes it's good for laughs, sometimes a strong and touching anti-war message comes across, and sometimes it's genuinely action-packed and exciting. Dolph Lundgren plays a *supposedly* top notch Russian operative dispatched by his superiors to get close to an African rebel leader who's objecting to the occupation by Russian and Cuban forces. The surprising thing is that Dolph's character isn't too good at his job and gets figured out. While awaiting punishment for screwing up the mission, he escapes and befriends a local bushman. The gentle and helpful ways of the bushman and his people help Dolph to realize he's fighting for the wrong side and he leads the rebels in a wonderfully over-the-top action finale. Director Joseph Zito is an old hand at this kind of action fare, having already directed Chuck Norris in the classics Missing in Action and Invasion U.S.A., and he and a capable crew give this all the juice that it needs, with a decent pace and violence aplenty. Zito also works with makeup effects expert Tom Savini once again; they'd collaborated previously on The Prowler and the fourth Friday the 13th movie. Dolph is fairly stiff as always, and it's up to the very amusing supporting cast to bring life to the story. The movie really hits its stride once the great character actor M. Emmet Walsh shows up, bringing lots of xenophobia, energy, and comedy relief to the proceedings, playing an investigative journalist. T.P.

Ruben Nthodi is fine as the rebel leader, with his associate played by Al White, whom the viewer may recognize as one of the jive talking dudes from Airplane!. But the performer who gives this movie a good deal of charm and presence is 95 year old Regopstaan, a natural in the role of the bushman Gao. These actors do help to make this fun. It's decent action fare where one can loudly root for the villains to meet their doom and where it's nice to see the redemption of the lead character.

Harrison Ford plays a blade runner whose job it is to hunt down and kill a group of rogue replicants. In the director's cut version the story is explained very well but it does drag out the story a bit too much. Acting in this production is mixed. You have some really good performances; like those of Daryl Hannah and Rutger Hauer who play replicants. You also get fairly basic and wooden performances from Sean Young and surprisingly from Harrison Ford who fails to evoke any emotion whatsoever in this. In the last ten minutes of the film where the pace really picks up with the chase scene between Ford and Hauer there is no emphasis in Ford's character which really let scenes down. Hauer gives an excellent performance, particularly with his final short monologue.Of course the special effects and music are now out-dated but they give the film a certain charm that means it still works today. The settings were excellent; Ridley Scott likes to do what he calls 'layering' in sets where he fills them with so much detail that they look real, this works great in this film. The dystopian setting where both night and day seem to look like the same thing and it constantly rains gives the film a great atmosphere and show just how great Scott is at his job.

First and foremost, it's about as cynical as any film of the decade, with little relief from the parade of human vices that surround one man's desperate plight. Then too, the year 1951 was not a year the American public was inclined toward introspection. What with the war in Korea and the hyper-patriotism surrounding the McCarthy hearings, people were not inclined to entertain what might be wrong with the leader of the free world. No wonder the film was greeted with a dull thud, eventually sinking into Late Show obscurity.Nonetheless, the film was definitely ahead of its time, with an appreciative following that has gathered over the years. What the movie does so effectively is to show how one man's (Tatum) unscrupulous use of the media can work to exploit the weaknesses of others. Exiled reporter Tatum (Douglas) hopes to get back to big time journalism by capitalizing on the plight of an unfortunate man (Benedict) trapped in the dusty ruins of New Mexico. But to do that, Tatum has got to get the cooperation of others so that the story can be delayed long enough to reach the desired national audience. And that means putting the story potential ahead of the trapped man's rescue. Thus, the desperate Minosa's life is put at risk for the sake of a big human interest story and one reporter's blind ambition.Now none of Tatum's various successes would be nearly so convincing without Kirk Douglas' absolutely bravura performance. His Tatum is so aggressively cock-sure, that his scheming is made to seem the natural order of things. And this scheming is based on what appears a glib understanding of human weakness. Thus, Tatum enlists Minosa's blowzy wife (Sterling) with prospects of a bulging cash register; the hick sheriff (Teal) with prospects of a bigger political career; the wobbly engineer with prospects of a permanent job; and the curious multitude with prospects of an entertaining spectacle. In short, Tatum has taken a human tragedy in a remote tourist stop and single-handedly turned it into a money-making enterprise.The whole production is given eye-catching cachet by on site filming in Gallup, New Mexico, where the squat mesas and dusty plains look nothing like standard Hollywood. And catch those crowds that stretch for at least a mile outside the digging site. Everyone from the surrounding area must have turned out for the filming. And I like the way Wilder builds the spectacle slowly, without fanfare, such that we only gradually become aware of how Minosa's plight is being submerged within the carnival-like merry-making. Thus, what starts out as one man's selfish drive has come to infect an entire region. No wonder the movie tanked in that Cold War year of 1951.Of course, no review would be complete without mentioning Jan Sterling's wonderfully tacky turn as Minosa's mercenary wife. The scenes between her and Tatum are like two circling sharks sizing up one another. Comedy or drama, Sterling remains a movie treasure from that long ago era.I do, however, have a major reservation with the movie as a whole. And that's with the ending. I detect the dead hand of Hollywood's Production Code behind Tatum's sudden redemptive turnaround and anguished period of suffering. Wilder handles the development about as well as possible given what's gone before. Nevertheless, the compromised ending remains. Of course, by Hollywood rules, Tatum's collusion in what turns out to be a form of murder cannot go unpunished. So, instead of a follow through on the story's basic theme, we get the last minute redemption that strikes me as not very plausible given what we've seen of Tatum's previous behavior. Seems to me, the headstrong Tatum would have found a way to rationalize Minosa's fate and then moved on. I think a more plausibly positive outcome would have the kid (Arthur) reject his mentor following Minosa's death, because he now sees where Tatum's brand of unscrupulous journalism leads.Be that as it may, the movie remains a gutsy look at how one man's corruption can spread like a virus. And given the power of today's greatly expanded media, it's a lesson worth noting.

","genre":"Drama, Film-Noir"},{"date":"15 July 2012","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" An exiled big city reporter exploits a New Mexico tunnel cave-in for selfish purposes, turning it into a human tragedy.Of Billy Wilder's classic works, I expect this one is the least known, and for understandable reasons. First and foremost, it's about as cynical as any film of the decade, with little relief from the parade of human vices that surround one man's desperate plight. Then too, the year 1951 was not a year the American public was inclined toward introspection. What with the war in Korea and the hyper-patriotism surrounding the McCarthy hearings, people were not inclined to entertain what might be wrong with the leader of the free world. No wonder the film was greeted with a dull thud, eventually sinking into Late Show obscurity.Nonetheless, the film was definitely ahead of its time, with an appreciative following that has gathered over the years. What the movie does so effectively is to show how one man's (Tatum) unscrupulous use of the media can work to exploit the weaknesses of others. Exiled reporter Tatum (Douglas) hopes to get back to big time journalism by capitalizing on the plight of an unfortunate man (Benedict) trapped in the dusty ruins of New Mexico. But to do that, Tatum has got to get the cooperation of others so that the story can be delayed long enough to reach the desired national audience. And that means putting the story potential ahead of the trapped man's rescue. Thus, the desperate Minosa's life is put at risk for the sake of a big human interest story and one reporter's blind ambition.Now none of Tatum's various successes would be nearly so convincing without Kirk Douglas' absolutely bravura performance. His Tatum is so aggressively cock-sure, that his scheming is made to seem the natural order of things. And this scheming is based on what appears a glib understanding of human weakness. Thus, Tatum enlists Minosa's blowzy wife (Sterling) with prospects of a bulging cash register; the hick sheriff (Teal) with prospects of a bigger political career; the wobbly engineer with prospects of a permanent job; and the curious multitude with prospects of an entertaining spectacle. In short, Tatum has taken a human tragedy in a remote tourist stop and single-handedly turned it into a money-making enterprise.The whole production is given eye-catching cachet by on site filming in Gallup, New Mexico, where the squat mesas and dusty plains look nothing like standard Hollywood. And catch those crowds that stretch for at least a mile outside the digging site. Everyone from the surrounding area must have turned out for the filming. And I like the way Wilder builds the spectacle slowly, without fanfare, such that we only gradually become aware of how Minosa's plight is being submerged within the carnival-like merry-making. Thus, what starts out as one man's selfish drive has come to infect an entire region. No wonder the movie tanked in that Cold War year of 1951.Of course, no review would be complete without mentioning Jan Sterling's wonderfully tacky turn as Minosa's mercenary wife. The scenes between her and Tatum are like two circling sharks sizing up one another. Comedy or drama, Sterling remains a movie treasure from that long ago era.I do, however, have a major reservation with the movie as a whole. And that's with the ending. I detect the dead hand of Hollywood's Production Code behind Tatum's sudden redemptive turnaround and anguished period of suffering. Wilder handles the development about as well as possible given what's gone before. Nevertheless, the compromised ending remains. Of course, by Hollywood rules, Tatum's collusion in what turns out to be a form of murder cannot go unpunished. So, instead of a follow through on the story's basic theme, we get the last minute redemption that strikes me as not very plausible given what we've seen of Tatum's previous behavior.

I should not have done that. It's not like we haven't seen this kind of coming of age films, but still this movie is one of the best in that category mainly due to the character development that we hardly see in coming of age teen dramas.The movie starts with a fine Saturday, when five high school students were forced to be in the school as detention. The first impression when I watched the first 10-15 minutes, I thought this could be the '12 Angry Men' of High School movies, at least thematically. It didn't disappoint me and that's saying a lot. Really, a lot. These five kids are quite different from each other, and they were proud of it. But as they began to talk amongst themselves(of course conflict arose at first) slowly, predictably but pleasantly they began to open up; and then we could very well relate to the characters. Each of those kids may be from a different background, from a different class of society, but there is that feeling of hard done-by that is common between all of them. That is where John Hughes was efficacious with this film. The characters are wisely chosen too. A brain, an athlete, a basket case, a princess and a criminal; the movie was able to do what it was intended to do because of these polarising characters. The performances of the actors in these characters are also one of the primary reasons of the success of the movie. The young actors, members of the core group of the 'Brat Pack' of the eighties did exceptionally well in depicting the varying range of emotions in their characters. Judd Nelson, especially, as the outcast tough-guy John Bender, managed to sway between being cool and also emotionally vulnerable deftly. All in all, this movie may not be a classic in terms of technical aspects but it has the heart in it that one cannot help but feel a whooping sensation when John Bender punches the air in that iconic end scene. The excitation of freedom, one may call it.P.S. Eightees' music was really cool.

John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Ving Rhames, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz portray the gangsters, the hit-men, the drug dealer and the boxer amongst an eccentric cast of characters set in LA. What makes the film so influential is it's nonlinear storyline and it's notorious dark humour and stylish dialogue. The way the events of the film unfold is remarkable, as we essential begin at the end of the film and Tarantino directs the story backwards, pitting us into a series of flashbacks and flash-forwards to tell the inter-connecting stories of these people; like he done with Reservoir Dogs. It sounds confusing, but it really isn't. It's a superb film and every single actor in it is amazing; they transcend any previous held opinions of them as they give unique performances which they would probably never get the chance to do again. Motivated after his highly successful independent debut Reservoir Dogs in 1992 which seen the birth of his nonlinear forte, Tarantino had retreated to Amsterdam to work on the screenplay for Pulp Fiction with Roger Avary. The result a masterpiece, deserving of every bit of praise it has ever received.It's tough to explain the storyline without giving much way, but basically, Vincent (John Travolta) and Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) are two hit-men working for the brutal and notorious Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). They are to retrieve an important briefcase from some small-time drug dealers who have burnt him in a recent deal. Then we have Butch (Bruce Willis) a heavy-weight boxer who agrees to take a dive for a large sum of money from Marsellus Wallace as he is up against one of his fighters in his next bout. But when he wins the bout, he must get out of town, as Mr. Wallace entrusts his two aforementioned hit men to track him down. That's the main storyline, however, there are many breaks in between as each one of the characters descends down different and troubled paths via flashbacks and the present day, as it all builds up to a very satisfying and surprising conclusion. Christopher Walken appears in a flashback as a soldier who brings the watch to Butch which has been passed down through his family's generations; his father had died in a Vietnamese POW camp. Eric Stoltz plays Vincent's drug dealer, who has a medical encyclopedia for every emergency, and this comes in handy when Vincent is instructed by Mr. Wallace to take his wife Mia (Uma Thurman) out on a date while he's out of town, while Harvey Keitel plays another gangster, who saves Vincent and Jules from a let's say, sticky situation. The brilliant Tim Roth has a very interesting role as well, as a small time crook who decides to hold up the wrong diner one morning.The story is divided up into different segments with chapter headings, pitting the characters into the different and sometimes very random situations. Pulp Fiction is a very stylish and raw film, with some very memorable dialogue and moments. Without a doubt one of the most influential films ever made in terms of how the story is played out; many other movies have attempted to master technique over the years, and they have all made very entertaining films. The highlight of the movie is without a doubt the basement scene where Bruce Willis and Ving Rhames - two nemesis in the film - find themselves tied up and at the mercy of a leather-wearing freak and a rapist sheriff and shot-gun wielding store owner. A samurai sword also plays a prominent role in this scene... What follows is absolute brutality, but stained in the glorious black humour of Tarantino's nature.

Is it possible for a guy to kill someone in a apartment premises and have not even one policeman come and inquire into that? hard to believe.... It looked as if he is just doing anything he is wanting to. Even at the end when he was talking to Lawyer about Paul Ellen, it wasn't clear if he really killed him or all this was just illusion? if he didn't kill him then whose body was he carrying. Well movie was not at all convincing. ","genre":null},{"date":"15 July 2012","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Well it wasn't a typical Christian Bale stuff.
