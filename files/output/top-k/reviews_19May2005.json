This movie shows you the many different camera techniques that are involved in film making today along with light and sound that set the movie and the scenes in it. The main characters of the film were Indiana Jones- goes through life playing a super hero and trying to gain his father's approval. When he has his whip and hat he becomes the super hero that we are all use to. When he take off them and puts on a pair of glasses he becomes a professor at a school. Dr. Jones is Indiana's father who never seems to approve of his son's quests. Dr Snyder is a blond haired woman who slept with both father and son and betrayed them to get a hold of the grail that she had become so drawn to it. Nazi soldiers try to get the grail for them selves to gain absolute power. Point of view is in third person form. It moves around and acts like a extra person looking in on the scene and everything going on.The setting of the movie first take place in the dessert on a Boy Scout camping trip. It introduces us to the young person of Indiana Jones and how he became the man we all know Plot is what makes the story from the beginning to the conflict then resolution. The story starts off with Indiana Jones in the past trying to get his fathers attention to show him that he brought back a gold cross. His father ignores him. In the beginning this proves that there is going to be conflict of the father and son trying to resolve the gap that is between them. The story then progresses into the place where Indiana is trying to rescue his father along with trying to find the Holy Grail at the same time. Through the whole story the only way the fighting was resolved was the near death experience with the father. The only way to save him was for Indiana to go through three tests and retrieve the Holy Grail. He uses his father's smarts and his own adventure skills to retrieve it and save his father. It confirms the bond of the two when his father calls him Indiana and not J.R. to save his life. Camera technique is used to make the story interesting and eventful to give us a clear picture of what the director wants us to see. One example is one of the tests the Indiana had to go through in the fortress to retrieve the Holy Grail. It was to be called a leap of faith. The camera switches back and forth from his father to Indiana in a technique called juxta position. The camera then moves to a full body view to a below view of Indiana taking a footstep on what appears to be nothing but air. When he does step on ground, it is a bridge to where the camera shows you from below to above the bridge while Indiana is walking on it. The most classic technique or angle is the scene of the hero's riding off in the sun set. Light is used to either keep things in shadow, to make them visible or to frame them. One example of this is when Indiana is a boy and he goes into a cave. As he is walking the shadows frame him and his friend so you pay attention to them and give you a sense of the darkness of the cave Sound is used to set the mood of the story. The one song that is used often in the film is the classic Indiana Jones song that usually played in a dramatic moment when he does something impressive. There were many other techniques and different things involved in the movie. So if you watched the movie before it is a good excuse to see it again and get a look of how they made the movie as great as they did ","genre":null},{"date":"19 May 2005","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Andrea (dre) Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is a movie a adventure and a story of a father and son's ability to bridge a gap that is between them.

John Cusack is the writer, John Kelso, and his explorations of Savannah, Georgia offer some mystery and fun, though the result will be flat for those who already know the story from reading the best-selling book.Better to be on the edge of a party, don't you think? a young woman named Mandy (Alison Eastwood) asks Kelso at one point. It's a pertinent question. Alison's father Clint and screenwriter John Lee Hancock try to accomplish much the same effect here, dancing at the perimeters of things, showing conversations where words can not be discerned. Many times we see Kelso looking in on some social function from the outside, like at a cotillion for black debutantes or bridge games at the Married Women's Club, a bit adrift but interested in the games people play.At the same time, Kelso becomes quite close to one Savannah resident, Joe Williams, an art dealer whose homosexuality is an open secret until he comes out of the closet by shooting his boy-toy. Kevin Spacey's performance as Williams is rich and fun, his accent not note-perfect but well-tailored to his polished delivery. The way he lazily smokes his cigars as he moves through a party, dabbles in lowcountry voodoo with Jesuitical zeal, or even eats gumbo in prison is a study in an actor's sense of the wholeness of the role.While many book fans savage this with the comment It's not what I read in the book, I take it in stride. John Berendt didn't carry this thing down from Mt. Sinai either &#x96; most notably by presenting the killing as something that happens after his arrival rather than before he played with the facts in the book. So when the film gives us a romance between Berendt's stand-in Kelso and Mandy or invents connections between the Williams story and the others in the book so the secondary characters can appear in the main story, it kind of works in an offbeat way.What doesn't work is the pace. The film goes on for over two and a half hours, and feels longer. Eastwood obviously approached this project with enthusiasm for the book, and especially for the music of Johnny Mercer which is prominently featured. But the comedy feels labored, the depiction of Williams' trial too unshaded in its sympathy for the defendant, and many of the performances, like that of Jude Law as the dead loverboy, seem underbaked.Two good performances are delivered by people who had real-life roles in the book. Sonny Seiler, who defended Williams, plays the judge in the trial and gets to tell himself when he's out of order. The Lady Chablis, who I never cared for much in the book, has an engaging vulnerability on screen. Even when the story screeches off track by focusing on her character, she makes the logic gaps less bothersome with her playfulness.I even liked Alison Eastwood, who does a good accent, looks the part of Mandy, and makes the film's most egregious detour from the book seem less of a violation. Not a stunner, but her languid delivery and drooping eyelids are very sensual in the everyday manner she presents us with, a half-promise of something good reaching out to you in the dark. In that way, she recreates the spirit of the book quite wonderfully. Pity her father didn't always do the same, but this is an entertaining film more often than not.

Written by John Hughs, the story-line is far from original, greatly resembling Pretty in Pink, but it still has an endearing charm that makes it a classic. The story line follows as such the lead male, a sensitive loner named Keith(Eric Stolz) is considered an outsider because he would rather focus on his art work than to be a jock, a nerd, or a trouble maker. He doesn't fit into any preexisting group. His only friend is a tomboyish drummer named Watts(Mary Stuart Masterson) who is in love with him, but he doesn't know. Keith wants to date the popular Amanda Jones(Lea Thompson), but she is dating a possessive, controlling, overtly rich Hardy Jenns(Craig Sheffer). Amanda breaks up with him, and to make it final she agrees to go out on a date with Keith. To Keith this is dream come true. He uses his newly formed connections with the out crowd to orchestrate an amazing date. Even going so far as spend all his college savings on a pair of diamond earrings for Amanda. Watts, ever faithful to Keith, volunteers to be their chauffeur for the evening. Hardy has invited both Keith and Amanda to a party he is throwing that night, but the real reason is so that he and his friends can jump Keith and beat him up. Keith hears about this and makes sure that his new-found friends keep the fight even. Just Keith and Hardy, but Hardy chickens out and is exposed as the spineless sleaze-ball we all knew he was. Amanda gives Keith back the diamond earrings and opts instead to be alone and learn who she is when she isn't defining herself by the boy she is dating. Watts has left the party and is walking away when Keith begins to run after her, he kisses her and gives her the earrings. Love wins out in the end and Keith utters the paramount quote, You look good wearing my future.This movie has my respect because it accurately portrays the social themes of the 80's without making them look cheesy; themes such as trying to figure out who you were, who your real friends were, the joy and pain of falling in love, and rebelling against your parents. Durring the 80's people felt liberated by the release of tensions with the ending of the Cold War. Stolz gave a great performance as a misunderstood, out of place teen trying to find his way. And Thompson was very believable as the poor girl from the working class neighborhood who tried to fit into the popular crowd; surprisingly enough, she didn't come off as pretentious, quite the opposite in fact, appearing deep and amiable. In America during the 80's social status was much more defined; people began to focus more on the individual and the individual's accomplishments.But Mary Stuart Masterson stole the show with her amazing portrayal of Watts. Not only was she witty, but she carried you along her emotional journey. Even when Keith had chosen Amanda, Watts still stood by him as long as she could. Her tough facade clearly hid an emotionally vulnerable woman who's lifelike predicament spoke to so many.Though this movie was not an initial box office smash, it is a perfect example of the 80's genre. Once you have seen this film it will inevitably become one of your all time favorites.

Watts has left the party and is walking away when Keith begins to run after her, he kisses her and gives her the earrings. Love wins out in the end and Keith utters the paramount quote, You look good wearing my future.This movie has my respect because it accurately portrays the social themes of the 80's without making them look cheesy; themes such as trying to figure out who you were, who your real friends were, the joy and pain of falling in love, and rebelling against your parents. Durring the 80's people felt liberated by the release of tensions with the ending of the Cold War. Stolz gave a great performance as a misunderstood, out of place teen trying to find his way. And Thompson was very believable as the poor girl from the working class neighborhood who tried to fit into the popular crowd; surprisingly enough, she didn't come off as pretentious, quite the opposite in fact, appearing deep and amiable. In America during the 80's social status was much more defined; people began to focus more on the individual and the individual's accomplishments.But Mary Stuart Masterson stole the show with her amazing portrayal of Watts. Not only was she witty, but she carried you along her emotional journey. Even when Keith had chosen Amanda, Watts still stood by him as long as she could. Her tough facade clearly hid an emotionally vulnerable woman who's lifelike predicament spoke to so many.Though this movie was not an initial box office smash, it is a perfect example of the 80's genre. Once you have seen this film it will inevitably become one of your all time favorites.

It is still entertaining but cornball. I remember when it first came out, it was a major hit. And Jennifer Beals was still passing for white. I am glad to see she is not doing that anymore. With movies such as All Saints and shows like the L Word. People actually aspired to be strippers after seeing this movie. Since all it was is a cleaned up stripper movie, not a dance movie. I still think that Flashdance phenomena is still going on to this day. Ever since that movie came out every stripper is a stripper because they use the Flashdance excuse, they are aspiring dancers who are paying for college..school. It is hilarious. The movie is kind of creepy now that I am older but at the time I thought nothing of this 35 year boss chasing after his 19 year old employee. Talk about a lawsuit waiting to happen. Also no way in Pittsburgh will there be a 19 year old arc welder. That is a very good job which takes years to master, a big union job. She surely could afford to go to any school she wanted if she was making welding money. And that bike would of been gone a long time ago with the bad weather Pittsburgh has in the winter. I liked that she did have friends too many of these movies the women seem to have no friends. But just boyfriends and perhaps a family member. And they all got along. I liked that. It was very sad that the actress who played Jeannie, Sunny Johnson, died the next year. She was very popular at the time and I remember being shocked. Jennifer Beals is very engaging in the movie, Micheal Nouri is creepy and entirely too old for her. It was a joke at time when people use to do Jennifer Beals imitations with her running in place to the music Maniac because it was the only scene in the movie you actually saw her face while she moving. What was distracting about the movie was the dance doubles, they did not even have the same body type and in the last scene, the one that is suppose to be the showstopper, that took away from the movie. They actually used a man named crazy legs to do the break dancing spin And you can see it! I was happy to see Cynthia Rhodes who is a real dancer..why didn't they use her for the lead since she could really dance? Since she married Richard Marx she hasn't been seen. I almost forgot about her. She was all over the place in during the 80's. I am happy to see Jennifer Beals career doing well. She really has picked good edgy roles. All in All the movie is very entertaining. Not The Red Shoes , but good for what it is...fluffy, not to be taken seriously. But Nouri is too old for that girl.

We are soon introduced to the characters, already on a mission as they receive a distress call from an unknown planet. A few are reluctant to go, but they are forced to (mainly because of the incredibly dominating Ash) unaware of the horror that awaits them...I guess human instinct and interest must have got the best of them, because instead of instantly fleeing and at the sight of a beast that was once alive (that stands an enormous hight) they enter it. Then do they flee? No. They go deeper. And deeper.Squeamish people may very well want to keep what I say in mind.

I am the male in the equation. My wife is traditional and nurturing -- which are attractive feminine features -- but she is 100% against abortion, even if rape. An unplanned pregnancy took place. We both preferred a female. The ultrasound indicates a male.Anyway, the 9 months of horror is only 1\/2 over now. The physical changes in body shape are not so bad yet. But already in 5 months her long slender youthful neck has disappeared. She now only has a bloated head on top of her body.The changes in energy are most unpleasant. She has become a sleepy, slouching, slumping, yawning low energy mass of flesh always drooping on me. Being close and clinging is kind of flattering, but with pregnancy it has become an endless series of face-to-face yawns and burps. She yawns during every waking moment when she is not belching -- right in my face.Think of any fun activity one might look forward to... now picture that you must do it with a partner who is going to yawn, yawn, and yawn again before doing this activity, during the activity, and after the activity. Even walking outdoors in fresh air at 12 noon -- YAWN. Then more sleep.Beltching and burping, do you want to talk about endless belching and burping? She looks like and sounds like a beer drinker after a 6-pack. Today I asked her to try not to repeatedly burp into my face. That went over real big.I cannot stay still at home. If I sit on the john, she is on my lap slouching. When I eat, she is burping over my plate.Life has become a living nightmare. The bipolar mood swings never end.

Because mainly its a more believable story than most horror movie stories e.g Nightmare on Elm St. (though i think thats great too) Because it makes you think this is actually realistic and could actually happen in real life. Because (and this is talking bout Halloween 1 now) it didn't try those cheap attempts at humor like other horror movies.

MFL scores highly in all departments; strong book, strong score, strong acting, strong sense of period\/costume etc. On the other hand it's arguably the Only and certainly one of a very few - in fact I can't think of another offhand - to throw its two Love songs away. The second one WAS intentional because it was written for the leading man, the non-singing Rex Harrison but the earlier example is mystifying. 'On The Street Where You Live' is a PASSIONATE love song in the best Cole Porter tradition, with a soaring melody by Fritz Loewe and though far from his best certainly adequate lyrics by Alan Lerner. This song is the musical equivalent of the person in the first flush of love who can't Contain his desire to tell the world about it and usually bores his\/her friends to death. As performed by Jeremy Brett (dubbed by Bill Shirley) it is stripped of all passion and is rather insipid, THIS is someone saying 'Well, I've met this girl and she's ... all right, I suppose. Not bad, certainly ... interesting, I suppose you'd say. Not bad looking really, in fact I quite like her'. Several mainstream singers recorded the song, not least Vic Damone, with whom it has become closely associated so WHY couldn't Warners stretch to a singer who could do it justice. As it stands Jeremy Brett\/Bill Shirley between them have managed to snatch a suet pudding from the jaws of a soufflé. The second love song, 'I've Grown Accustomed To Her Face' is, in many ways the PERFECT love song inasmuch as Lerner and Loewe were faced with writing a love song - and one which doubled as an 'eleven o'clock' number for a non-singing misanthrope. This is the 'self-discovery' type of love song and perhaps it needs an Actor as much as if not more than a Singer. Essentially it merely illustrates in words and music the well-documented phenomena of someone 'growing' on us surreptitiously.

This seems to make a strong case for Musicals with strong 'Books' and songs written specifically to further the action as opposed to the Amateur fumblings of the Baz Luhrmans of this world and their inept attempts to quart of one era into the pint pot of another. MFL scores highly in all departments; strong book, strong score, strong acting, strong sense of period\/costume etc. On the other hand it's arguably the Only and certainly one of a very few - in fact I can't think of another offhand - to throw its two Love songs away. The second one WAS intentional because it was written for the leading man, the non-singing Rex Harrison but the earlier example is mystifying. 'On The Street Where You Live' is a PASSIONATE love song in the best Cole Porter tradition, with a soaring melody by Fritz Loewe and though far from his best certainly adequate lyrics by Alan Lerner. This song is the musical equivalent of the person in the first flush of love who can't Contain his desire to tell the world about it and usually bores his\/her friends to death. As performed by Jeremy Brett (dubbed by Bill Shirley) it is stripped of all passion and is rather insipid, THIS is someone saying 'Well, I've met this girl and she's ... all right, I suppose. Not bad, certainly ... interesting, I suppose you'd say. Not bad looking really, in fact I quite like her'. Several mainstream singers recorded the song, not least Vic Damone, with whom it has become closely associated so WHY couldn't Warners stretch to a singer who could do it justice. As it stands Jeremy Brett\/Bill Shirley between them have managed to snatch a suet pudding from the jaws of a soufflé. The second love song, 'I've Grown Accustomed To Her Face' is, in many ways the PERFECT love song inasmuch as Lerner and Loewe were faced with writing a love song - and one which doubled as an 'eleven o'clock' number for a non-singing misanthrope. This is the 'self-discovery' type of love song and perhaps it needs an Actor as much as if not more than a Singer. Essentially it merely illustrates in words and music the well-documented phenomena of someone 'growing' on us surreptitiously.

You could watch them in any order, but to give the characters more depth, and make better sense of a couple minor references, I would still recommend watching them in order.In my Die Hard 2 (1990) review, I complained (although apologetically) a bit about the lapses in internal logic. It ended up being somewhat excusable, because I read Die Hard 2 as a satire of the genre as much as a serious action film. With Die Hard 3, John McTiernan is back at the helm, as he was for Die Hard (1988), and the result is once again a more serious action film (containing some comic relief, of course) with very taut internal logic. In fact, Die Hard With a Vengeance is so well constructed, so well acted and so well directed that I like it just as much, if not better, than Die Hard.John McClane (Bruce Willis) is once again separated from his wife, and he's once again living and working as a cop in New York City. As the film begins, he is on a temporary suspension for some never-specified infraction (it works better that it isn't specified, as it enables us to imagine all kinds of crazy things that this gruff character might have done). After a bomb explodes at the Bonwit Teller department store, a mysterious person calling himself Simon calls the police taking credit and asking to speak with McClane--or he'll detonate further bombs in crowded areas. They rouse McClane from the aftermath of a drunken stupor. He shows up at the police station with a hangover, looking haggard. Simon is fond of riddles and makes McClane engage in a bizarre game of Simon Says. The first task is for McClane to head up to Harlem and stand on a street corner in his skivvies wearing a sandwich board that says only, I Hate Blacks (using a more inflammatory epithet than blacks). Of course, he almost gets killed, but at the last minute, a reluctant savior in the form of a local shopkeeper, Zeus Carver (Samuel L. Jackson), helps save his butt. Unwittingly, Carver ends up embroiled in the Simon Says games with McClane, with increasingly serious stakes. Just who is Simon? Why is he toying with McClane? I should note that I was predisposed to like this film. I like Bruce Willis a lot, but I especially love Samuel L. Jackson. The combination of the two here is simply magical. They have remarkable chemistry and the characters that scriptwriter Jonathan Hensleigh has drawn enable both deep tension and hilarious comic moments between the two.But the film succeeds on more than the charisma of its two principal actors. Die Hard With a Vengeance has a fantastic, intelligent plot. Hensleigh ties his villain to the story of the first film in a semi-satirical way that gives the motivation for the Simon Says games great depth. The Simon Says games manage to be silly, smart, humorous and great catalysts for dramatic tension at the same time. There are subtle jokes about New York City, New York City cops, reverse racism, European opinions of American intelligence, and so on. And of course, there are many edge-of-your-seat, nail-biting action sequences involving a wide variety of environments in the New York City area. The wide variety of environments was a nice change over the more limited settings of the previous two films, and gives Die Hard With a Vengeance a feel almost like an adventure film.It's remarkable that Hensleigh and McTiernan were able to sustain such a high level of excellence throughout. If you look at Die Hard With a Vengeance from a broader perspective, the whole is constructed something like one of Simon's puzzles. Every scene leads inevitably, logically to the next scene, even though the film takes many left turns, and the solution of one dilemma to the next often involves split-second timing.It's often said that McTiernan and Hensleigh simply ignored Die Hard 2, and in terms of direct plot and dialogue references, this may be true, but they still give Die Hard 2 a nod by having an attendant humor--often almost goofy humor--in many action scenes. One of the most direct nods occurs with McClane riding something of an explosion (of water this time). This is one of the more hilarious scenes of the film.As for subtexts, they are similar to those of the first Die Hard, with some interesting additions. There is an intriguing parallel between McClane's disheveled state, the typical New York City chaos, and the attempts to further undermine stability from the villain.

Although I wasn't alive during the original's release, this new generation can at least relate to the complete chaos that it sparked. We have The Matrix. And when the prequels roll around in another decade or so, which you know they will, all us 35 year old geeks will be on tip-toes in line to get the midnight tickets too. But that isn't what The Phantom Menace is about. The Phantom Menace is about bringing to life what has been swirling around in the inconceivable depths of Lucas' mind years before Star Wars A New Hope was even pitched to Universal Studios (and actually turned down). It's the opening act to a nine-part saga (the last three of which probably won't see the screen) that unites all humanity under one big foundation of a Japanese legend created by Akira Kurosawa in The Hidden Fortress (which we'll get into with a later review). The film opens with the trade blockade of a gorgeous little planet named Naboo. There to settle disputes with the Trade Federation and the Republic are two Jedi Ambassadors, Qui-Gon Jin (Liam Neeson) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), meeting with the Federation Viceroys. But when the Viceroys are ordered by a mysterious robed force to kill the Jedi's and begin the invasion of Naboo, negotiations are ground to a halt. Already old-time Star Wars fans are shaking their heads in confusion. Why are there Viceroys and Ambassadors? When did Star Wars become a bad analogy for the United Nations? Well, that's an aspect of these three prequels that people are just going to have to get used to. Instead of haphazard adventure and swashbuckling Han Solo, we get galactic politics. One reason behind this shift in perspective is in the simple fact that Science Fiction films have become undeniably more intelligent in the last 30 years. Releasing a prequel that contains little more than adventure and romance would do nothing for the saga. In order to impress both the last generation of Star Wars fans and the new one, Lucas had to smarten his films up a bit. Also, he has to start the lineage that leads to Luke Skywalker while, at the same time, start a civil war within the Republic. He has to mix the politics of the war with the beginning of events the that lead to Luke's birth. And while doing this, George Lucas also has to create three films that work as complete entities all on their own. Pretty tricky stuff if you ask me. Anyway, after Naboo is invaded and the Queen has been captured, Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon Jin rush in to rescue her with the help of the controversial sea creature Jar Jar Binks. To put it simply, old-timers hate him, young people love him. Lucas' way of hitting up the new generation for ticket sales. From there, the three and company have to escape to the Outer Rim planet of Tatooine (ring a bell?) and find some parts to repair their ship. What Lucas preserved from the original films is their spectacular sense of pacing. We're taken across the galaxy, to three drastically different planets that all have their own dialects, life forms, climates, architecture, and political stance. The sense of adventure, despite the inclusion of heavy politics, is still blissfully present. We're still treated to blistering chases, this time in the form of a visceral pod race, epic battles, now between the indigenous Gunguns and the Federation droids, and lighting fast lightsaber duels, now between the menacing Darth Maul and our two favorite Jedi. It's all still here, but sometimes now plays to the influence of a new generation of film. What really helps The Phantom Menace is its cast. Although Jake Lloyd playing Anakin has some trouble with his lines, casting choices like Liam Neeson, Natalie Portman and Ewan McGregor are all spot on. They fit so ideally in their roles, all being well-known actors but not tabloid superstars, making their inclusion more fitting than box office slimy. If I were to see Brad Pitt as Obi-Wan and Julia Roberts playing Queen Amidala, tears would come to my eyes. But what everyone wants to know is if The Phantom Menace is a fitting addition to the Star War legend. In my opinion, yes. People debate that it's too wordy and political for Star Wars, but in reality, the politics are kind of a relief. They pull us deeper into Lucas' universe, making us understand it instead of simply letting it become the backdrop. And the politics play ideally into the lineage of Luke Skywalker and the division of the Republic. Also, The Phantom Menace manages to keep itself contained. As a stand-alone film, The Phantom Menace still holds up. Its plot, although another link in the chain, manages to hold its own as a viable story and plays itself out in traditional adventurous swagger. It's everything that Star Wars should be, a swashbuckling adventure that lifts us out of our world and into one that lived a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.

From there, the three and company have to escape to the Outer Rim planet of Tatooine (ring a bell?) and find some parts to repair their ship. What Lucas preserved from the original films is their spectacular sense of pacing. We're taken across the galaxy, to three drastically different planets that all have their own dialects, life forms, climates, architecture, and political stance. The sense of adventure, despite the inclusion of heavy politics, is still blissfully present. We're still treated to blistering chases, this time in the form of a visceral pod race, epic battles, now between the indigenous Gunguns and the Federation droids, and lighting fast lightsaber duels, now between the menacing Darth Maul and our two favorite Jedi. It's all still here, but sometimes now plays to the influence of a new generation of film. What really helps The Phantom Menace is its cast. Although Jake Lloyd playing Anakin has some trouble with his lines, casting choices like Liam Neeson, Natalie Portman and Ewan McGregor are all spot on. They fit so ideally in their roles, all being well-known actors but not tabloid superstars, making their inclusion more fitting than box office slimy. If I were to see Brad Pitt as Obi-Wan and Julia Roberts playing Queen Amidala, tears would come to my eyes. But what everyone wants to know is if The Phantom Menace is a fitting addition to the Star War legend. In my opinion, yes. People debate that it's too wordy and political for Star Wars, but in reality, the politics are kind of a relief. They pull us deeper into Lucas' universe, making us understand it instead of simply letting it become the backdrop. And the politics play ideally into the lineage of Luke Skywalker and the division of the Republic. Also, The Phantom Menace manages to keep itself contained. As a stand-alone film, The Phantom Menace still holds up. Its plot, although another link in the chain, manages to hold its own as a viable story and plays itself out in traditional adventurous swagger. It's everything that Star Wars should be, a swashbuckling adventure that lifts us out of our world and into one that lived a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.

Although I wasn't alive during the original's release, this new generation can at least relate to the complete chaos that it sparked. We have The Matrix. And when the prequels roll around in another decade or so, which you know they will, all us 35 year old geeks will be on tip-toes in line to get the midnight tickets too. But that isn't what The Phantom Menace is about. The Phantom Menace is about bringing to life what has been swirling around in the inconceivable depths of Lucas' mind years before Star Wars A New Hope was even pitched to Universal Studios (and actually turned down). It's the opening act to a nine-part saga (the last three of which probably won't see the screen) that unites all humanity under one big foundation of a Japanese legend created by Akira Kurosawa in The Hidden Fortress (which we'll get into with a later review). The film opens with the trade blockade of a gorgeous little planet named Naboo. There to settle disputes with the Trade Federation and the Republic are two Jedi Ambassadors, Qui-Gon Jin (Liam Neeson) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), meeting with the Federation Viceroys. But when the Viceroys are ordered by a mysterious robed force to kill the Jedi's and begin the invasion of Naboo, negotiations are ground to a halt. Already old-time Star Wars fans are shaking their heads in confusion. Why are there Viceroys and Ambassadors? When did Star Wars become a bad analogy for the United Nations? Well, that's an aspect of these three prequels that people are just going to have to get used to. Instead of haphazard adventure and swashbuckling Han Solo, we get galactic politics. One reason behind this shift in perspective is in the simple fact that Science Fiction films have become undeniably more intelligent in the last 30 years. Releasing a prequel that contains little more than adventure and romance would do nothing for the saga. In order to impress both the last generation of Star Wars fans and the new one, Lucas had to smarten his films up a bit. Also, he has to start the lineage that leads to Luke Skywalker while, at the same time, start a civil war within the Republic. He has to mix the politics of the war with the beginning of events the that lead to Luke's birth. And while doing this, George Lucas also has to create three films that work as complete entities all on their own. Pretty tricky stuff if you ask me.
