What you thought of it probably depended on your impression of the movie beforehand. If you're a fan of Cheech and Chong-style stoner movies, and you're a gen-xer or younger, you probably enjoyed it. If you knew it was going to be stupid and expected little, you probably didn't like it.I thought it was an excellent movie. I know not many serious people felt that way, but there you go. I like a movie that is self-consciously stupid, and I felt that this one pushed that concept to the limits. Everything seemed to be done to give the impression to the uninitiated that this was a bad movie. The writing on the surface seems terrible; the acting on the surface seems terrible. And I'm not going to say you have to look deep to find meaning. The deeper you look, the less meaningful the movie becomes. The filmmakers are working from a long tradition here. Give Ashton Kutcher and Sean William Scott some credit; they are both gifted comic actors, and they are both funny here. The movie doesn't make much sense, even when we find out what the continuum transfunctioner is. The bare-bones plot seems like nothing but an excuse to have these two half-wits go on a series of misadventures. And yet, I don't think it can be denied that these vignettes are funny, often hilarious. And the dialogue is so stupid that it's really hilarious as well. ConsiderCHESTER Dude, you just touched Christy Boner's hoo-hoo. JESSE Shibby!MR PIZZACOLI A trained dolphin could deliver pizza better than you too. JESSE But then the pizzas would get all wet!And so on. The movie is full of non sequiturs and dumb dialogue. And if you're in the right frame of mind (and no, I don't mean high) then much of this is hilarious. The fight with the Chinese food takeout lady (And then? No and then! And then? I refuse to play your Chinese food mind games!); the guy in the cage (played memorably by Andy Dick); the transsexual stripper (or, as he\/she puts it, gender-challenged male); the race of identical hot chicks, and their enemies, the totally gay Nordic dudes; the cult of Zoltan; and, of course, the continuum transfuctioner itself, which is a Rubiks cube that Chester is able to solve, despite barely having the brainpower to tie his own shoes. This is all very funny, and I think you have to be some kind of film snob to not see the artistry that went into making a movie so stupid that ends up being so entertaining.What you have is the most likely future cult classic to come out in many a year. It's a stoner movie where nobody (human) does any drugs; a mystery with no real mystery; and a dumb movie that, because of the calculatedness of its lunacy, is not really so dumb after all.

I'd given an older kid 50p to borrow his copy of Texas Chain Saw Massacre. I took it home and put it in the top-loader. It took me a fair while to press down on that chunky silver 'play' button, recollecting the stories I'd heard about the film. Rumours were flying around the school - the filmmakers had gone mad whilst making the film and killed each other - Leatherface was real - it was a documentary and the killings are all real. Chain Saw was a snuff movie. So, I pressed down the hefty button and braced myself for what was to come, eyes peeled, resisting the need to look away as if I were looking at a traffic accident. When the film was over I felt disturbed. I hadn't witnessed real human killings, I hadn't just seen a snuff movie, but Chain Saw had reached deep down inside of me and planted a seed of unease, I felt cold to my very core but I didn't know why. As the years passed my recollections of the film became more and more distorted. Most notably my memories of the killings within the film - bloody, gore-filled scenes. Blood. Lots of blood.The reason I have rambled on about these events is that, until re-watching the film, I appeared to share the same memories as those that had seen it around the same time as me. This is a testament to Chain Saw's masterful construction, a film powered by the age-old technique of suggestion. There is hardly a drop of blood shown within the film, yet people will remember it in bucket-loads. In fact, director Tobe Hooper only shows us what is necessary, maybe because of the low budget he was working with (Hooper's later output would suggest this), but it forced creativity from the filmmaker that is sadly lacking in his other work (Poltergeist may be an exception, but Hooper's direction was steered by Spielberg on that one).Okay, the story A mini-bus carrying five teenagers drives through Texas. Pre-emptively they drive past a slaughterhouse as cows await their death. The tone, and their fate, is set, and it is only a matter of time before the teenagers will become meat to a local cannibal family. Their ordeal begins when they enter a sinister old house (don't they always?) and start to snoop around. Before you know it one of the teens, who you're expecting to be the lead, is struck over the head with a mallet by Leatherface (Gunar Hansen), an obese retard with a skin mask. As he falls to the floor, his body twitching, Leatherface closes a sliding metal door and finishes the job where we cannot see it. From here on in it's basically a matter of picking off teens one by one with the use of the mallet, a meat hook and, of course, the chain saw.What is essentially a by-the-numbers plot is raised above par by the style and atmosphere of the film. From bizarre shots of solar flares to the hot, sun soaked imagery of Texas, Chain Saw seems to be sweating horror out of every pore. The locations are macabre beyond belief, in particular a room with hanging animal bones and bone constructed furniture, and the whole film has a hot, musty orange glow about it that almost makes you smell the dead human meat in the cannibal house.The performances are relatively functionary from the cast, although Marilyn Burns puts in a good turn as the tortured 'final girl', making us feel that her life is truly at risk. Even though all she does is scream and plead for her life, she does so with such energy and realism that it is difficult to watch her. Most disturbing of all is a scene where the grandfather of the family, a man so old he can barely move, is given a hammer to deliver a deathblow to her head. The family holds her over a bucket as the old man raises the hammer to strike her, but he is barely able to hold it, let alone hit her with it.Chain Saw is full of images that will horrify and disturb, but unlike many other films that do the same, Chain Saw will leave you breathless with its unrelenting assault on the senses; from the images on display to the ear-shattering sound design that allows Leatherface's saw to intrude your living room and slice at your nerves. Texas Chain Saw Massacre is one of those few horror films that will unnerve you to a degree of unrest because it hits home where it hurts. Its savage, raw power and its total lack of reason give the impression you are watching something you shouldn't be. A bit like the traffic accident I mentioned earlier. In fact, you never really have time to think about what you are seeing until after the film has ended, which leaves an indelible image of a skin-masked madman waving a chain saw around his head in anger.So, if you watched Chain Saw a good few years ago and remember it being a standard slasher flick with lots of gore, revisit it and see just how effective suggestion can be. If you've never seen it - what are you waiting for? This is low-budget film-making at its best and a lot can be gained from repeat viewings.

So I checked this creepy little horror out and unfortunately this doesn't, for me, go down in history as a good one.Trying to be completely neutral and not let my own personal non enjoyment get in the way, my biggest problem was the ending. I actually liked a few things about Joyride, one being the genuinely frightening, creepy atmosphere. Joyride wasn't at all campy. You could feel the tension leaping off the screen. This was a genuinely frightening movie and the quiet dark atmosphere worked well too. At the same time the movie had an almost noirish atmosphere about it at times and the characters were all well developed as people and there was humor involved as well, an example being the hilarious scene where the two male leads walk into the restaurant naked. And Rusty Nails was genuinely frightening. So that's a few positives. But there were a lot of negatives too.This movie is really gory and violent as many horrors are(though Joyride is almost unnecessarily so) and I'm not one for that though it's to be expected, but in addition to that, it just turns into a cliché and another typical horror by the end. This would have played better as a not to violent, more sedate, movie-more of a drama. I think I'd have enjoyed it more that way anyway. But the cliché factor isn't the only problem. The movie goes from cliché to ridiculous. It contains an ending that makes absolutely and completely no sense and there were more plot holes in the last few minutes then in ten other horror movies combined. I don't think the movie can have it both ways-don't try to be a serious horror and then throw an ending like that at the audience. It almost insults our intelligence because the movie's strength was that something like this could really happen, WITHOUT all the supernatural stuff becoming a part of it. It veers into the unexplainable with that ending also, to many things that don't make any sense, and leaves one feeling cheated. All this would have been fine if it had played like a supernatural type movie or straight out horror from the beginning but it didn't. And it just doesn't go with the rest of the movie. It was incredibly frustrating.I really wish this had been more of a straight drama. I didn't enjoy it at all but did sit through it to see the ending. I mean the movie IS great at building tension, I'll give it that, so you sort of want to see how it will turn out, but I did feel cheated by the ending.I think the ending was probably done like that to set up the possibility of a sequel. I wouldn't see it, more then likely, I'd just ask somebody how it ended. I can't say I liked Joyride and after seeing so many complaints about the ending both on the message boards and in the reviews, I just gotta wonder what the point was.I'd rank this a low 3 for the reasons mentioned above.

So I checked this creepy little horror out and unfortunately this doesn't, for me, go down in history as a good one.Trying to be completely neutral and not let my own personal non enjoyment get in the way, my biggest problem was the ending. I actually liked a few things about Joyride, one being the genuinely frightening, creepy atmosphere. Joyride wasn't at all campy. You could feel the tension leaping off the screen. This was a genuinely frightening movie and the quiet dark atmosphere worked well too. At the same time the movie had an almost noirish atmosphere about it at times and the characters were all well developed as people and there was humor involved as well, an example being the hilarious scene where the two male leads walk into the restaurant naked. And Rusty Nails was genuinely frightening. So that's a few positives. But there were a lot of negatives too.This movie is really gory and violent as many horrors are(though Joyride is almost unnecessarily so) and I'm not one for that though it's to be expected, but in addition to that, it just turns into a cliché and another typical horror by the end. This would have played better as a not to violent, more sedate, movie-more of a drama. I think I'd have enjoyed it more that way anyway. But the cliché factor isn't the only problem. The movie goes from cliché to ridiculous. It contains an ending that makes absolutely and completely no sense and there were more plot holes in the last few minutes then in ten other horror movies combined. I don't think the movie can have it both ways-don't try to be a serious horror and then throw an ending like that at the audience. It almost insults our intelligence because the movie's strength was that something like this could really happen, WITHOUT all the supernatural stuff becoming a part of it. It veers into the unexplainable with that ending also, to many things that don't make any sense, and leaves one feeling cheated. All this would have been fine if it had played like a supernatural type movie or straight out horror from the beginning but it didn't. And it just doesn't go with the rest of the movie.

That's quite the bold statement to make but with good cause. This film holds up probably more than any other comedy in existence. You know how there are those movies that you see that are hysterical the first few times you see them? This one just keeps on coming. I remember when I was a kid, I wore our copy of Ghostbusters out. At the time, I thought it was a horror movie (I wasn't the brightest bulb) so I watched it constantly (Being that I am a horror buff) never realizing what it truly was. I hadn't yet caught on to a lot of the humor. About eight years later, I noticed that I hadn't seen the film for forever and a day. I popped it in and oh my God...I just about died with laughter.This movie has something for everyone. Director Ivan Reitman said that he found a comedic formula for films...it works as follows There's the brain, the heart, and the mouth. Ghostbusters scored with all of them. As the brain of the bunch, Egon Spengler's (Harold Ramis also co-wrote it) use of witty humor is hilarious. If you have the right mind set, almost everything Spengler says is laugh out loud funny. At the heart of the Ghostbusters is Dan Aykroyd's (Who created the idea for the film) lovable fool, Ray Stantz. Ray has a tenacity for saying simple minded things and using very little logic and yet somehow the man got a P.H.D. (Probably through studying habits, despite ignorance.) There's a line that he says involving a smell in the beginning of the movie that I am chuckling at just thinking about it. This of course leaves Bill Murray (He was nominated for a Gloden Globe) as the sarcastic Peter Venkman (The mouth of the beast.) Peter is likely the one that gets the most laughs because he, being the mouth that he is, never stops making fun of everything. It's like Rodney Dangerfield in the party scene in Caddyshack but a whole lot funnier and continues the rest of the movie. The film also produces some laughter out of the minor characters as well. The scatological humor toward the end of the film between Rick Moranis (In a role intended for John Candy) and Sigourney Weaver is quite laughter inducing. Ernie Hudson in one of his first big roles has a few good lines as the other Ghostbuster, Winston Zeddmore (The only one who's not a doctor) and William Atherton of Die Hard fame plays the ultimate annoyance as Walter Peck. Not to be forgotten in the mix is Annie Potts as Janine who has some rather memorable humorous lines, for instance the one I've written to summarize the movie. Numerous other well known faces are seen on screen too, which includes John Belushi (Or rather his continuation of the character Bluto, from Animal House) as the principal image used for the now famous 'Disgusting Blob,' Slimer. Like any good comic will tell you, good comedy is generally about setting up the other guys around you. Well, it just so happens that the characters all work well with each other to set the great comedic moments staged in this film.Not to be forgotten however in all the funny one liners and set ups is the overall film. Ghostbusters was nominated for numerous awards including Oscars for best song (Courtesy of Ray Parker Jr.) and special effects, which are now slightly dated but possibly work even better with the wacky style being consistent with the rest of the movie. Along with Parker, there are numerous other great songs including a song by The Bus Boys that climbed charts and a rather creepy seeming song (But works well) by Mick Smiley. Another thing that should not be forgotten is the horror elements of the film. Though purposely outrageous, the effects do serve as some potential scare moments. Among the most frightening involve stop motion animated puppets called Terror Dogs. Though the scares are few, they do work fairly well (They had me convinced as a youngster) bringing enough threat to the ghosts that haunt New York City. The story itself is interesting as well, involving some intriguing mythology of Sommeria among other countries.Where some films tend to only work a few times, Ghostbusters is consistent. Although, I've found movies such as CLUE, Dr. Strangelove or Airplane to be funnier at different times in my life, this one still makes me laugh even after seeing it hundreds of times. From the opening scares to the ending credits, it will almost surely reel you in. I've laughed harder at some moments in other films but it's rare that I find one that's funnier throughout. Even those films lose their edge after you see them a few times...this one just doesn't. If you haven't seen it, do so. You will almost certainly be glad you did. If you have seen it and didn't like it, try watching it again in a few years. It's almost sure to grow on you eventually. I dare anyone to sit through this movie and not laugh once, no matter how many times they've seen it. If you don't laugh, you're either trying really hard to hold back, have a very odd sense of humor or are dead! It's just that funny. Although I don't rate films, I would easily rate this one a five out of five, placed among the classics. Believe it or not, I think that it belongs alongside Citizen Kane and Lawrence of Arabia. It also spawned an entertaining sequel in 1989. Enjoy!

Released amid great controversy and accused of being an offensive and unholy film, the truth of the matter is that it is a deeply reverent work which has the courage to ask challenging questions about the pressures and doubts Jesus must have experienced as the appointed Messiah. It also shows the violence of the times in graphic detail. If viewers consider it blasphemous to explore on film the immense burden of duty that Jesus bore through his life, then they are narrow-minded and ignorant. If people feel that to show the brutality and harshness of life in Roman times is tasteless and inappropriate, then they are guilty of glorifying difficult but factual truths. There is NOTHING offensive about this film. There is, however, much that is challenging.Jesus (Willem Dafoe), an honest carpenter, saves Mary Magdalene (Barbara Hershey) from a stoning. Already dimly aware that he is destined to lead an extraordinary life, he soon finds himself being drawn into the role of a religious figurehead. But Jesus finds it hard to accept that he is a Messiah, and as his reputation and following grows he constantly questions if he is a strong enough man to handle the burden of being God's son. After isolating himself in the desert, where he experiences several hallucinations in which he is confronted by visual manifestations of good and evil, Jesus finally concludes that he IS the true son of God and whole-heartedly sets about imparting his love and wisdom to all who'll listen. Later betrayed to the disgruntled Romans by his friend Judas Iscariot (Harvey Keitel), Jesus is crucified. While on the cross, he imagines what his life would have turned out like if he had shied away from his duty as the Messiah and lived life like a mere mortal.It is this final section of the film that has provoked the most vociferous outrage. The sequence shows Jesus as he slowly dies on the cross, dreaming of an alternative life in which he sins and copulates and hates like all normal people. Many people have criticised the film on the grounds that these scenes are blasphemous. Such claims are nonsense - the film is not saying that Jesus was a sinner, nor that he gave in to temptation of the flesh, nor still that he was a man filled with hate. The film is merely saying that, in such great pain and so close to death while still just a young man, he might - just maybe - have wondered if it was all worth it. At the end of the film, we see Jesus accept his role knowing that his death is the ultimate act of unselfish love, so the film actually is totally in agreement with what all Christians believe. If the film had come to the conclusion that Jesus's whole life was a waste, his death too, then maybe the detractors would've had cause to complain. But how can they possibly be offended by the film as it stands? For goodness sake, it's a film about absolute faith!!! In truth, The Last Temptation Of Christ is an excellent movie. Compellingly acted, beautifully shot on Moroccan locations, and full of telling ideas, it is a work of real depth and power. The accents are sometimes distracting and some of the dialogue occasionally betrays ill-suited modernisms, but apart from these minor drawbacks it is one of the most important and thought-provoking films ever made.

The problem is that both films handle different subject matters. And while Fat Girl was successful in what it set out to do, Romance X fails miserably. This year I re-watched another chick-flick I never thought much of, Bertolucci's Stealing Beauty, and found myself enjoying it a great deal, so I tried to do the same with Romance X. It didn't work out, I now hate the film even more.The film is described as porn for women, and it already starts with a totally unbelievable premise School-teacher Marie (Caroline Ducey) has a boyfriend (Sagamore Stévenin) who refuses to sleep with her for no reason whatsoever. He doesn't have any problems with getting an erection, or finding her attractive, he just doesn't want to have sex. What a believable premise! Maybe it was supposed to be unbelievable, maybe this is a deep, thoughtful, surrealistic film, but it's just not interesting. The fact that it never crosses Marie's mind that her boyfriend might be GAY doesn't help it from being existentially funny. But again, maybe it was supposed to be unintentionally funny, maybe this is a deep, thoughtful, surrealistic film, but it's just not interesting.Marie fails to be a likable character as well, like most in the film. She is about 23, has the body of a 13-year old, the face of a 30-year old, and talks like a repressed, grumpy 75-year old. Every single line of dialogue that comes out of her mouth are mostly complaints on how miserable her sex life is, how much she hates men, and her amazing depressing theories on sex in general. It is not a very far stretch to assume it is Breillat speaking her lines, not Marie. Anyone who watches this film will get the impression that Briellat has never spoken to a human being. The most charismatic character, and actor, of the entire film is Ducey's first affair, a lonely Italian man named Paolo (Rocco Sifreddi) who seems to be the only human being in the film. The problem is that&#133; well&#133; Rocco is not an actor, he is a porn star only cast because of the size of his penis. You know you are in trouble when a guest porn star is the film's most interesting personality, because compared to Marie's boyfriend, he is Cary Grant. But again, maybe it was supposed to be unrealistic, maybe this is a deep, thoughtful, surrealistic film, but it's just not interesting.While it lasts for about 90 minutes, it feels like you are watching a much longer film. There is nothing wrong with films being slow and taking their time, but this one does it for no reason at all. There is a scene where Marie is lead by a man into being tied up for a bondage experience. It last about ten minutes for the man to lead her into his room and pull the ropes around her, only for her to give up. Later in the film, she tries it again, and so we begin to roll our eyes. But again, maybe it was supposed to be slow, maybe this is a deep, thoughtful, surrealistic film, but it's just not interesting.So you might be thinking that at least if the film is a pretentious, boring mess, well, at least it delivers as a soft-core porno, right? Wrong. This is the most misfire I've ever seen as an erotic film. Although I applaud Caroline Ducey for taking her extentions as an actress to the limit during the sex\/nudity scenes, but they are anything but arousing. In fact, they are unbelievably boring. Only one involving Rocco Sifreddi is a bit, dare I say, far from tedious, but it would have helped if the actress at least seemed like she was enjoying it. I know this was not supposed to be a film about titties, but what else could one look for when there is nothing else? But again, maybe it was supposed to be non-erotic, maybe this is a deep, thoughtful, surrealistic film, but it's just not interesting.Romance X is one or those films that think they are art-house masterpieces, that they are groundbreaking, and that in the future it will be remembered as a classic. I've seen Lifetime Original Movies that portray strong, independent women in a more successful way than in this film. Maybe this film would have been quite a statement had it been released back in the early 70s, but in 1999 it does feel a bit outdated. Surely a film with such a controversial topic as a woman committing&#133; gasp&#133; adultery would be very shocking. How couldn't it be, a woman who attends&#133;gasp&#133; nightclubs by herself. What will she do next to be outrageous, take a valium? As a side note, the nightclub sequences have to be seen to believe. The music is bad even for Euro-techno standards and it is so low you can hear people's footsteps in the dance floor. But that is only a minor flaw in such a mess of a film. While the cinematography is beautiful and the work with colors (especially red and white) is effective, it doesn't manage to make this worth 90 minutes (which feel like 4 hours) of your life. But again, maybe it was supposed to be an unintentionally funny, unrealistic, slow, and non-erotic. Maybe this is a deep, thoughtful, surrealistic film, but it's just not interesting.

The most obvious difference between it and other movies I noticed was the way it was animated. The lines and shapes were constantly changing and shifting. In one of the first couple of conversations, the girl that the main character talks to even has shifting hair. When the girl talks about geometric shapes (I think), the hair at the side of her head turns into geometric shapes. I'm not sure exactly what she talks about, but it's something like that. Anyway, I also noticed people's eyes changing color, and many other things. I think that this contributes to the over all feeling you get watching this movie, making it seem like a dream. Another thing that does this is the cross between animation and live action. I loved the fact that you couldn't tell sometimes whether it was animation or real. This gave it a huge feeling of the whole thing being a dream. I know that it wouldn't have been as good or interesting if there weren't this neat type of animation.Another thing I really enjoyed about this movie was the lack of plot. The whole portion of the movie I viewed was just a guy going around and listening to people talk about what they think. I thought this was a very interesting way to get these ideas across. This makes the whole movie very original (though it is definitely not the only thing that makes it unique). The one part that stands out in my mind is the conversation between the two people lying in bed. It is singled out to me because it was the only conversation I saw that the main character wasn't involved in. Well, he wasn't really involved in the other conversations, but he was present. I don't recall seeing him in this particular scene at all. It also stands out to me because of what they talk about. I just thought the concept of living a whole life that literally is a 10 second flash of life from an older person is neat. It made me think about our life being an infinitely long 10-second span. This is another thing that I like about this movie, is that it makes you think about what you hear. I don't like it when you can see a movie and forget about it a second later. To be good, it has to leave an impression on you, and make you think. This movie, even though I only saw a small portion of it, definitely did that.

To be good, it has to leave an impression on you, and make you think. This movie, even though I only saw a small portion of it, definitely did that. ","genre":"Animation, Drama, Fantasy"},{"date":"14 April 2005","score":"","review":" In my English class, I recently viewed a portion of this film, Waking Life. The most obvious difference between it and other movies I noticed was the way it was animated. The lines and shapes were constantly changing and shifting. In one of the first couple of conversations, the girl that the main character talks to even has shifting hair. When the girl talks about geometric shapes (I think), the hair at the side of her head turns into geometric shapes. I'm not sure exactly what she talks about, but it's something like that. Anyway, I also noticed people's eyes changing color, and many other things. I think that this contributes to the over all feeling you get watching this movie, making it seem like a dream. Another thing that does this is the cross between animation and live action. I loved the fact that you couldn't tell sometimes whether it was animation or real. This gave it a huge feeling of the whole thing being a dream. I know that it wouldn't have been as good or interesting if there weren't this neat type of animation.Another thing I really enjoyed about this movie was the lack of plot. The whole portion of the movie I viewed was just a guy going around and listening to people talk about what they think. I thought this was a very interesting way to get these ideas across. This makes the whole movie very original (though it is definitely not the only thing that makes it unique). The one part that stands out in my mind is the conversation between the two people lying in bed. It is singled out to me because it was the only conversation I saw that the main character wasn't involved in. Well, he wasn't really involved in the other conversations, but he was present. I don't recall seeing him in this particular scene at all. It also stands out to me because of what they talk about.

Under the suggestion by his girlfriend, Keyes & his friends hold an art show where the main attraction will be a re-enactment of the dinner scene murder from his dream, that Keyes hopes will end the nightmare, however while Keyes attempts to stage a mock-up of the incident, the evil spirit dwelling behind the glass frame of the mirror has other ideas & that's to do a very real re-enactment of the event using Keyes friends as a very real set of victims.AMITYVILLE A NEW GENERATION is the seventh film in this long running series that takes the same route as both parts 4 & 6 by having a cursed object taken from the infamous house of horror to be the one causing all the demonic mayhem (not surprising since the same people who made those two films made this one as well) the film is well acted & director John Murlowski does fairly well behind the camera & the story for the most part is probably one of the most better written & should have been one of the most compelling entries to ever grace the series. While the film does have a certain sense of weirdness to it & some pretty good (if brief) special effects & a pretty suspenseful climax it sadly never reaches the full potential that it should.While I admire the film-makers taking a different route & trying to do something new with the series, the sad fact is AMITYVILLE A NEW GENERATION comes off as alternatively dull & plodding most of the time. The script by AMITYVILLE 1992 writers Christopher Defarria (who also produces) & Antonio Toro while indeed serves up some creepy images, for the most part is unconvincing, simply because a lot of the film is filler. There's an interesting flashback sequence that ties Keyes connection to the homeless man that is fairly interesting, but apart from that the film fails to do anything new or interesting & merely just retreads the same old ground of it's predecessors, only with less styles. The image of the infamous home is seen in the frame of the mirror every time a murder occurs, which doesn't make a lick of sense, since it should be the demon that inhabited the house itself that should be showing up not the home, since the home is only the house it dwelt in, in truth that seems to have only been inserted in order to pass this off as a sequel since there's very little-if anything (minus the title & house image) that ties this film anywhere to the previous instalments. Take out the house & you would still have a movie, there's no connections to the previous events or the house itself, we've also come to learn that Sonny Montelli from AMITYVILLE II THE POSSESSION (or Ronny DeFeo, which ever AMITYVILLE version you choose to go with) wasn't the only person to blow away his family in the house, as twenty six years prior Richard Bronner (the homeless man & who is eventually revealed to be Keye's long lost father) also blew his family away (what's with this house getting people to blow away their families with loaded shot guns anyways)? Things get even more complicated (said disappointing) when we learn that it isn't the evil of the infamous house after all, but rather Keyes father who is orchestrating the supernatural going on's & trying to get is son to repeat the crime.The film does feature some familiar names both in front & behind the camera, with the exception of producers Barry Bernardi & Steve White who again return as producers, there's also, composer Daniel Licht (Hellraiser 3 Hell On Earth) Richard Roundtree (Shaft) Terry O' Quinn (Lost & Stepfather 1 & 2) Barbra Howard (Friday The 13th The Final Chapter) David Naughton (An American Werewolf In London) Lin Shaye (A Nightmare on Elm Street 1 & 7) Robert Rustler (A Nightmare On Elm Street 2 Freddy's Revenge) & author John G. Jones (who's book AMITYVILLE THE EVIL ESCAPES) also serves as a co-producer. Speaking of Jones, it's his book which was made into a movie (AMITYVILLE HORROR PART 4 THE EVIL ESCAPES) that served as the basis for this movie.All in all, AMITYVILLE A NEW GENERATION isn't a total loss, but could so easily have been the series creepiest entry if handled properly, as it is, it remains a watchable entry that is strictly for those who saw & loved at least some of the earlier instalments.The ending leaves an opening for yet another sequel AMITYVILLE DOLLHOUSE **1\/2 stars ","genre":"Horror"},{"date":"14 April 2005","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" I will try to stay as positive as I can with this.

The main character of the Nick Hornby book is more annoying and dispiriting than the guy played by John Cusack. I couldn't relate to the book-version Rob's mean-spiritedness and his relentless selfishness. Hornby apparently said the book was about 'England', but his main character isn't someone I recognize, and I'm British. Yes, the English have their sad-sacks, but someone this 'sad' (British meaning) is way off the chart, even in places like Peckham. He was a depressing guy to read about. So chopping out the worst excesses of the annoying Rob lightens the tone of the movie a lot, and the fact that they kept the humorous bits in - the top five lists, the musical snobbery, the talking to the camera \/ reader saying things like 'I swear I'm not making this up' - makes the movie the story the book should have been, I reckon. And the excellent performances from John Cusack (co-writer), Jack Black, and the weird little guy who plays 'Dick' make the funny bits even funnier. All-in-all a really well done movie. From Rob's girlfriend walking out on him at the beginning through to Jack Black's amazing singing at the end, hardly a bum note in the whole piece.
