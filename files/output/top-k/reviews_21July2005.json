Either they don't believe you, thinking that such a classic story can never become a good comedy, either they will not give the movie a try, because they are convinced that this will be much too difficult for them to understand or because they aren't familiar with the Greek writer and his work. No, tell everybody that this is a comedy from the Coen brothers and you'll be sure that you have an interested audience...This movie tells the story behind the adventures of three escaped convicts. It's 1937 and the economic crisis weighs heavy on everyone. But the three man aren't exactly worrying about their financial status. They escaped from the jail chain-gang with the intention to pick up the the loot of a bank heist that Everett had stashed away near his home. But their way is long and difficult. They meet all kinds of strange characters (sirens, a bank robber, a campaigning Governor and his opponent, a KKK lynch mob, a blind prophet...), but don't have much time to really think about all that happens to them, because the house will soon be flooded by a newly built dam...After watching this movie, I just needed a little break before I could go on with something else. The reason for that is quite simple I had been laughing so hard that it almost started to hurt. This is an incredibly funny movie with some excellent humor in it. With this movie, the Coen Brothers really made an excellent adaptation of the ancient Odyssey, although O Brother, Where Art Thou? isn't exactly a title that reminded me of an old Greek writer. Before having all the correct information, I even believed that this movie had something to do with Shakespeare or someone from that time period.It isn't a very strict 'translation' of the Odyssey of course, but it isn't too hard to find some similarities either (like for instance the sirens). But what would a movie be with a very good story when the acting isn't excellent? Indeed, nothing at all. But don't worry, George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson are absolutely brilliant. Their performances are amazing and I was especially surprised by Tim Blake Nelson. I can't remember that I've ever seen him play in another movie, but what he did here, only promises the best for the future.All in all this is a wonderful comedy that will not only be loved by the people who are familiar with Homer's Odyssey. This movie has been based on it, but only loosely, leaving enough room for a new interpretation and some excellent humor. Add to this some very fine acting and you know that you have another hit from the Coen Brothers. I loved this movie and I can't remember that I've ever seen any comedy better than this one.

I can definitely see why people would feel that away, after all it's a mobster movie based on a true story, Joe Pesci plays a crazed mental midget, Robert DeNiro plays the sly and cool leading male and f-bombs are dropped almost every second. I don't criticize people that feel 'Casino' is a bit of a rip-off, but I believe it's not. My experience of viewing Martin Scorsese's brutal and bloody classic 'Casino' is that it's similar in a lot of ways to 'GoodFellas', but it's a different film. 'Casino' isn't so much about the ups and downs of organized crime, as it is about how Vegas really got started, and it just so happens it was started by a greedy, ruthless and scary syndicate -- the Italian mafia.'Casino' follows the true tale of Jewish tough-guy, Sam 'Ace' Rothestein (Robert DeNiro). In the heart of the 1970s, Ace is approached about running the Tangiers Hotel & Casino casino floor, which is run by the mob. Ace is told by another Jewish mafia associate, Andy Stone (Alan King) that he doesn't won't even require a gaming commission license to run Tangiers, since the gaming commission is ten-years behind registrations. Everything seems to be set financially for Ace, as long as he allows the mob soldiers to skim a percentage of the casino's money for the bosses of the different crime families. Ace is being protected by his best friend and mob capo, Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) and his crew of misfits. Nicky is cruel, lascivious, greedy and has a very short temper that when tested causes him to act outrageously violent and demoniac. Things are going great between Ace and Nicky, then Ace meets the seemingly beautiful and kind, but actually selfish and rapacious Ginger (Sharon Stone). Ace falls for Ginger and the two eventually get married, but have severe marital problems involving Ginger's old flame, the sleazy and conniving Lester Diamond (James Woods) and Ginger's drug and alcohol abuse. When everything seems so perfect and mirthful for Ace, his world falls apart very rapidly before his eyes. His wife is crazy, he's loosing money, he's having problems in general with the Tangiers casino and his once solid but now rocky relationship with the malignant goon, Nicky. The film also stars Don Rickles, Frank Vincent, Dick Smothers, John Bloom, L.Q. Jones and Kevin Pollack as the owner of the Tangiers Hotel & Casino.What 'Casino' really boils down to is being a tale of avarice and it's consequences. The film starts out very optimistic and satisfying for all the characters, but quickly and abruptly turns sour for everyone. It perfectly demonstrates how money and wealth consumes you and changes you; especially in the case of having Ace and Nicky be bosom buddies in the beginning but end up loathing each other so much that they considering whacking one another. 'Casino' may drag a tiny bit in it's two hour and fifty-nine minute runtime, but when it's all over it turns out to be an excellent film. Martin Scorsese does another incredible job behind the camera, while the actors are even more solid in this one then in 1990's similar mob movie 'GoodFellas'. Robert DeNiro should have earned an Oscar nomination for his perfect portrayal of Sam 'Ace' Rothstein the Jew with Italian-mob connections who always plays his cards right. Joe Pesci is great as to be expected as the barbaric and cutthroat gangster, Nicky, but no where near as excellent as he was as the heartless waste of human life he played so impeccably in 'GoodFellas'. But the show really belongs to Sharon Stone in an impressive and remarkable performance as the crazy but ultimately pathetic junkie trophy wife of Ace. I never really thought she was a good actress until 'Casino', and in the film she really proves herself. James Woods is ideally cast as the film's undeniably unlikable parasite and Don Rickles is very upstanding in his role. The film features Frank Vincent (who you may know as the creepy mob villain, Phil Leotardo in HBO's hit drama 'The Sopranos') as Nicky Santoro's right man. The film has a lively music score and Scorsese and Nicholas Pillegi deliver a fine screenplay.If you haven't already, take three hours to sit down with a big ass bowl of popcorn and watch Scorsese's 'Casino', but only after you've seen 'GoodFellas'. You may not enjoy or appreciate it's brutal violence, crude language and overall staunch ferocity, but hey, odds are you may enjoy it if you give it a chance.

First I didn't get it. But then I watched it on DVD, the whole 4 hours in one go. I got sucked into this amazing world. I love the story. I find the mini series colorful and expressive, human, passionate, with interesting characters, exquisite costumes, beautiful interiors, but cheap-looking special effects.Lynch's Dune is exactly the opposite. I love the special effects, given the technology available in 1984. The worm cannot be done any better.My biggest issue is the complete lack of humor. Like many other science fiction movies, it takes itself to serious but the characters not serious enough. Think Flash Gordon. The characters talk about emotions, but they don't act them, because the script doesn't let them. So many great actors, so little fun. The whole movie feels static and rigid. This continues with the production design. The retro-look combines 20000 leagues with 19th century Austrian Empire. Some darker elements remind of Brazil, but without its sense of self-irony and caricature.Then the casting of Paul. I find it difficult to take Kyle MacLachlan seriously in this role. On his hero's voyage from nobody to reluctant hero to acceptance of his destiny nothing happens in his face. Same look, same posture, no matter what. Compare it with Alec Newman in the mini series.However, there's a lot to like about this movie. The visually rich production design, stunning special effects, and great actors.The movie does a great job at visualizing a fantasy universe. It just fails to tell a compelling story. I think of it as a picture book. It's fun to watch in pieces of 30 seconds. Oh, how was the hand-in-a-box test again? Ah, there it is.By the way, if you're into the depiction of sexually degrading power-plays, you'll find a few scenes. This is a David Lynch movie after all.

Impressed by the gore and special effects, I actually quite liked this film and took my good memories of it into my later years of horror fandom, i.e. now. Well, shortly before I caught this flick again anyway, as now that I've seen much more of the genre; Wishmaster is no longer the film I thought it was, and my good memories of it have now been replaced by the correct idea that this is, in fact, a rather tedious, cliché ridden, shameless attempt to cash in on younger horror audiences that haven't seen much beyond the endless waive of Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street sequels. The cameos in the film show this quite clearly, with small roles for the likes of Robert Englund ('Freddy') and Kane Hodder ('Jason'), among other credits that are clearly marked on the video box in order to draw in audiences; such as Peter Atkins, writer of the Hellraiser sequels and Pierre David, producer of Scanners and Videodrome. In fact, the only 'established' horror name that I enjoyed seeing in the film was Reggie Bannister; the poor man's cult icon and star of the Phantasm series.It's a shame that this film spoilt itself by the cash-ins and clichés, as the idea behind the story actually isn't bad. It follows an ancient Djinn ('evil genie') that is unleashed from it's prison by a gemmologist named Alex. The evil creature needs to grant three wishes to the one who awoke him in order for him to take over the world. While he's getting round to that, the Djinn amuses himself by granting wishes to other people and collecting souls in the process. This story is good because it works from an idea that hasn't been used often in horror, but it fails due to the execution. Instead of delving into it's central character, the film instead follows the all too familiar lines of the slasher and while some of the 'wishes' are nicely executed, most of them are unimaginative and very silly. The film is also much more boring than you'd expect it to be and after a while it becomes far too monotonous and predictable. The film's only real saving grace is Andrew Divoff in the role of the title monster. He's malevolent and foreboding and while he makes too much use of his gruff voice at times, which ends up making the movie rather silly, he is good on the whole. If you haven't seen many horror movies, or just the newer stuff, you'll probably like Wishmaster. I would recommend it therefore, but if you've only seen newer films; instead, I recommend you catch some of the older stuff and forget this.

There's so much I can say about this movie but all my comments always come down to one thing this movie is beautiful. Pure genius. A timeless story. I might be a little biased in my beliefs, seeing as the first movie I remember seeing in theatres is The Lion King and I still watch it on a regular basis and know all the words but I'm sure there are plenty of people out there who agree with what I have to say. The Lion King is beautiful; hands down, it is the best Disney film ever created.The story is something that everyone can relate to, whether they are a lion ;) or not. Simba is destined to become king one day and just can't wait to rule the throne; everyone can relate to wanting to grow up and become an adult, to do whatever they want and not have to worry about anything. His father tries to teach him that, despite the fact that he will one day be grown and king, his life will not be easy. Simba has to learn his lesson the hard way when his Uncle Scar, who, too, wants the throne, kills his father and convinces Simba that it was his fault. Suddenly, growing up doesn't seem so great anymore (I can *really* relate to that).And so, Simba flees his home and comes across Timon and Pumbaa, two other outcasts. They teach Simba the Hakuna Matata lifestyle, something that idealizes a life free of stress, worry and responsibility. Now, don't we all wish we could live this way? No worries for the rest of our days... But when Simba's childhood friend Nala returns, he realizes that he can't live Hakuna Matata forever, for he does have a responsibility to his pride and his homeland. Simba understands that he must grow up, as we all do, and does what's right.The songs are catchy and fit the movie well (the original songs, of course, though The Morning Report isn't too bad) and the score is haunting and beautiful. Along with the art work, the music captures the heart of Africa.With the types of shows that children watch these days (boy, doesn't that make me sound old?), it's a wonder they'll learn in virtues and values at all. The Lion King is a great teacher when it comes to learning lessons that will carry throughout their lifetime.

There's so much I can say about this movie but all my comments always come down to one thing this movie is beautiful. Pure genius. A timeless story. I might be a little biased in my beliefs, seeing as the first movie I remember seeing in theatres is The Lion King and I still watch it on a regular basis and know all the words but I'm sure there are plenty of people out there who agree with what I have to say. The Lion King is beautiful; hands down, it is the best Disney film ever created.The story is something that everyone can relate to, whether they are a lion ;) or not. Simba is destined to become king one day and just can't wait to rule the throne; everyone can relate to wanting to grow up and become an adult, to do whatever they want and not have to worry about anything. His father tries to teach him that, despite the fact that he will one day be grown and king, his life will not be easy. Simba has to learn his lesson the hard way when his Uncle Scar, who, too, wants the throne, kills his father and convinces Simba that it was his fault. Suddenly, growing up doesn't seem so great anymore (I can *really* relate to that).And so, Simba flees his home and comes across Timon and Pumbaa, two other outcasts. They teach Simba the Hakuna Matata lifestyle, something that idealizes a life free of stress, worry and responsibility. Now, don't we all wish we could live this way? No worries for the rest of our days... But when Simba's childhood friend Nala returns, he realizes that he can't live Hakuna Matata forever, for he does have a responsibility to his pride and his homeland. Simba understands that he must grow up, as we all do, and does what's right.The songs are catchy and fit the movie well (the original songs, of course, though The Morning Report isn't too bad) and the score is haunting and beautiful. Along with the art work, the music captures the heart of Africa.With the types of shows that children watch these days (boy, doesn't that make me sound old?), it's a wonder they'll learn in virtues and values at all.

I am always surprised at how few people I know have seen this movie, given how incredible it is and the fact that there are take-offs of GGR moments and characters found in so many TV shows. Those in the know usually put this film in their top 25.Obviously, this is no action movie that drags in the unwashed masses. Instead, the popularity is due to the characters and the acting. This, in spite of the solid story that provides a framework. This dark tale is sort of depressing if you're in sales! The performance of Jack Lemmon in this movie literally brings a tear to my eye. He was so incredible that I immediately started digging up and watching (or re-watching) every movie with him in it. What a genius he was.As for the others, there is no debate that this star-studded cast gave performances that would be expected of actors with their significant credentials. That said, I do part company with many of my fellow reviewers. Kevin Spacey and Ed Harris (and of course Jack Lemmon) were convincing in their roles, and their characters made sense. I did not feel the same about the others.One of my all-time favorites, Al Pacino, undoubtedly brought his own flavor to the Ricky Roma character, and it didn't work for me. He was simply too, well, weird in sort of a Scent of a Woman way, and his bizarre vocal inflections and body movements were an unwelcome distraction.Alan Arkin's character, George, (as opposed to his portrayal of it) was not believable. He came across as so dependent and mentally challenged that success in sales, or any field, would be unlikely and he would have starved to death long ago.Alec Baldwin is in the same boat, in that while he powerfully played a character that was already established in the writing and the play, his character was not believable. I don't see how Mitch and Murray would have let their operation get to the point it was and then send this pit bull in there. Or maybe, they were just bad enough managers to have done that, which I guess WOULD make sense. In any case, it is over the top. That said, it was very important to establish early in the story that one COULD be wildly successful in that business, so you would have a context for the other characters.Some have commented about the film's geographical setting, and it is ambiguous enough that it is almost distracting. People seem to believe that the setting was New York. After all, it was filmed there. I was certain that it was set in Chicago and that the outside shot with NYPD-colored police cars was an uncharacteristic affront to a viewer's intelligence. Not only does every city mentioned exist around the Chicago area (as well as NYC - with the exception of Batavia which is a suburb of Chicago but hundreds of miles from NYC), but I have a hard time believing that when people in NYC need to get away, they go to Wisconsin, as Dave Moss said he was going to.

It has stayed with me ever since my first viewing. I must have seen it 6-7 times and I still get a quiver down my spine, when I watch certain scenes. I don't think I can say this is true of very many other films.I think the reason why this film made such an impression on me is because it speaks to the intellect thorough the body and visa versa. It makes it evident that although western civilization has subscribed to the vision of the separation between body\/mind, we cannot separate these to entities in our experience of reality. We cannot exactly determine whether we make decisions based upon gut-reactions or if we make them through reasoning.The first part of the film plays mainly upon the capacity of the viewer at imagining physical pain. The best example being the pimp who has been lying in his bed for a year, but who is still alive. The first time I saw that scene, I felt nauseous and disgusted. I thought of it as a straight forward gut-reaction, this man who has suffered such pain, and he is still alive. The darkness of the city, the bleakness of the future for people living there coupled with the acute presence of tenderness in the characters also strikes me. Once again I had a very physical reaction to the scene where Somerset speaks Mills' wife about her being pregnant. Although he himself has chosen not to bring up children in such a harsh world he says If you decide to have them, spoil them every way that you can. Every time I see this scene I find myself crying.When we finally reach the end of the film, when we are transported from the rainy dark city to the open and nowhere-to-hide place where John Doe wants to deliver his package. The dialog of the serial killer has the same effect on me every time - I get a stomach ache... The brilliance of it all being that I cannot exactly explain where this stomach ache comes from. Do I get a stomach ache simply because this man is such an eloquent incarnation of evil? Or is it mainly because I cannot help but agree with some of the things that he is saying? Only in a world this shitty could you even try to say these were innocent people and keep a straight face. But that's the point. We see a deadly sin on every street corner, in every home, and we tolerate it. We tolerate it because it's common, it's trivial.John Doe has a lot in common with Somerset, who also feels despair at the way of the world I just don't think I can continue to live in a place that embraces and nurtures apathy as if it was virtue.John Doe's actions, his evil master plan marks him as an insane person, who has transgressed the taboos of a civilised society, even though his deed was to punish other transgressors. Throughout the film we have had to imagine all the terrible deeds that John Doe performed on people of - granted - questionable moral dispositions. We get to see him, and listen to his tale. However appalling his actions are, the actual fact that I as a viewer can agree with some of the things that he is saying turns the physical nausea of imagination from the first part into a kind of intellectual nausea... How can I agree with him even a little bit? This in turn once again creates a physical reaction - a stomach ache. I get a physical reaction as a response to my own reasoning. It reminds me that we all have some type of evil within us, we want pedophiles and evil lawyers to get what they deserve. We can imagine doing something to put things right. But we wouldn't ever do it - that would make us insane. We can imagine this exactly they way the film has let us imagine the pain afflicted, but not let us see it. In short, my fascination with this film comes from the fact that it speaks to the intellect through the body and visa versa. It shows me how experience cannot really be separated into body\/soul. At the same time as it shows me exactly how much I experience the mind and the body to be two separated entities. A true masterpiece!

The best example being the pimp who has been lying in his bed for a year, but who is still alive. The first time I saw that scene, I felt nauseous and disgusted. I thought of it as a straight forward gut-reaction, this man who has suffered such pain, and he is still alive. The darkness of the city, the bleakness of the future for people living there coupled with the acute presence of tenderness in the characters also strikes me. Once again I had a very physical reaction to the scene where Somerset speaks Mills' wife about her being pregnant. Although he himself has chosen not to bring up children in such a harsh world he says If you decide to have them, spoil them every way that you can. Every time I see this scene I find myself crying.When we finally reach the end of the film, when we are transported from the rainy dark city to the open and nowhere-to-hide place where John Doe wants to deliver his package. The dialog of the serial killer has the same effect on me every time - I get a stomach ache... The brilliance of it all being that I cannot exactly explain where this stomach ache comes from. Do I get a stomach ache simply because this man is such an eloquent incarnation of evil? Or is it mainly because I cannot help but agree with some of the things that he is saying? Only in a world this shitty could you even try to say these were innocent people and keep a straight face. But that's the point. We see a deadly sin on every street corner, in every home, and we tolerate it. We tolerate it because it's common, it's trivial.John Doe has a lot in common with Somerset, who also feels despair at the way of the world I just don't think I can continue to live in a place that embraces and nurtures apathy as if it was virtue.John Doe's actions, his evil master plan marks him as an insane person, who has transgressed the taboos of a civilised society, even though his deed was to punish other transgressors. Throughout the film we have had to imagine all the terrible deeds that John Doe performed on people of - granted - questionable moral dispositions. We get to see him, and listen to his tale. However appalling his actions are, the actual fact that I as a viewer can agree with some of the things that he is saying turns the physical nausea of imagination from the first part into a kind of intellectual nausea... How can I agree with him even a little bit? This in turn once again creates a physical reaction - a stomach ache. I get a physical reaction as a response to my own reasoning. It reminds me that we all have some type of evil within us, we want pedophiles and evil lawyers to get what they deserve. We can imagine doing something to put things right. But we wouldn't ever do it - that would make us insane. We can imagine this exactly they way the film has let us imagine the pain afflicted, but not let us see it. In short, my fascination with this film comes from the fact that it speaks to the intellect through the body and visa versa. It shows me how experience cannot really be separated into body\/soul. At the same time as it shows me exactly how much I experience the mind and the body to be two separated entities. A true masterpiece!

One of the most special motion pictures ever created was a film that combined brutal and painfully realistic violence, grittiness, a great composition of the music of 60s, 70s and 80s, a compelling storyline, authentic dialogue, incendiary narrative storytelling and a hell of a lot style. It was known as 'GoodFellas', veteran filmmaker Martin Scorsese's extraordinary mob film, that was a landmark in cinema because it superseded 'The Godfather', in my opinion. Many people agree 'GoodFellas' outranks 'Godfather' but many disagree also. In a nutshell, 'The Godfather' is what started it all, it's a stylish, super-cool Oscar-Winner with fantastic acting but 'GoodFellas' paints a more updated portrait of life in organized crime, and unlike 'Godfather' shows the severe consequences and results that come with being a 'wise guy'. 'GoodFellas' is an amazing movie that will no doubt impress you if you take the time to view it.The film begins with a grown-up Hill riding in a car with two other mob associates, the slick, cool and smooth spoken Jimmy Conway (Robert DeNiro) and the psychopathic and violent mental midget Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci - in his Academy Award- winning role.) It's late at night and both look exhausted and they hear a thumping in the bank of the trunk and wonder what is going on. They pull of to the side of the road, open the trunk to reveal a older gentleman severely beaten up and bloody pleading, 'please, don't. please.' Tommy then takes a butcher knife and continues to aggressively stab him while Jimmy shoots him several times with a revolver. They close the trunk and the camera pans to Hill's face and he narrates, 'As far back as I can remember I always wanted to be a gangster.'. After that moment, viewing the rented DVD from Blockbuster, I knew I was in for a powerful, realistic, gritty but astonishing motion picture.The dark and beautifully shot feature 'GoodFellas' follows the true story of mob associate Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) and his rags-to-riches tale starting as a poor fresh-faced Irish-Italian kid in slums of Brooklyn running numbers for low-level hoods to working along side of major mob players. Hill was a boy obsessed with how the mafia worked and like most kids dreamed of being an astronaut, fireman, or president of the United States, he dreamed of being a wise guy. The movie then follows Hill's live in the mob until the 80s. I can't really tell you too much without giving the film away, but I can tell you he encounters interesting situations and the movie never ceases to be wild and entertaining. It's definitely the best mafia film ever made.There are many things to praise about Scorsese's most talked about motion picture 'GoodFellas'. First of all is the acting. All the performers, every one of them, are at the top of their game. Ray Liotta gives a strong performance as the film's narrator and main character, Henry Hill, while Robert DeNiro gives an absolutely riveting performance out-shining Liotta in almost every scene they share. It's a shame DeNiro wasn't nominated for an Oscar for the wonderful job he did in 'GoodFellas'. Lorraine Bracco impresses as Liotta's sassy but ultimately typical Italian-mob wife, while Joe Pesci is extraordinary and ferocious in his scene-stealing role as the blood-hungry and crazy paisan, Tommy DeVito, whom everyone is afraid of. Paul Sorvino rounds out the leading cast as the tough but quiet mob boss, while the film is packed with small roles played by such actors as Vincent Pastore, Tony Darrow, Mike Starr, Chuck Leow, Tony Sirico, Henny Youngman, Frank Vincent, Frank Sivero and Samuel L. Jackson. Martin Scorsese provides direction so brilliant you really can't put it into words, that should have won him the 'Best Director' Oscar at the 1991 Academy Awards Ceremony. Scorsese and Nicholas Pilleggi (who wrote the novel which 'GoodFellas' is based upon) provide one of the richest and finest screenplays ever created, and Thelma Schoonmaker provides marvelous editing.There are really no dull parts about this tough and brutal but beautiful and brilliant masterpiece from one of our generations best filmmakers, Martin Scorsese. If you haven't already and don't mind a little grit (actually a lot of grit) make it a mission to drive to Blockbuster and rent this movie on DVD. 'GoodFellas' is one of the best and most memorable films ever made. I think you'll enjoy it.
