Not my top 100, but overall and I don't agree with its place at the Top 250. It's a movie about almost anything. There are quite a few movies like it, but Scarface is something special. If it didn't come out between movies like The Godfather and Goodfellas, I am sure it would have been even a more special movie. We have a really interesting character. Tony Montana who is involved with the drugs business. Nervous, eccentric, strange, funny. Something from everything. I assume that Al Pacino is the only actor that could play such a person. He was chosen for best actor of all time and this movie made his name gold since it was silver after The Godfather. At least this is my opinion on Pacino's career. Stunning performance. Of course the movie is much more than Woah, Pacino rules, but he is the highlight like Hanks in Forrest Gump, Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs, Depp in Ed Wood. You know what I mean.So the movie has other colorful and interesting characters which brought a great atmosphere to the movie. Such as Michelle Pfeiffer's heroine who is Montana's wife in the later period of the movie, some infamous for me names did a great performance, such as Tony's friends and his sister.Brian De Palma's best movie and Stone's script are NO 2 most important thing. Really tremendous writing by Stone who has had drug problems at that time. Really interesting story around him and Scarface. After Scarface, he has written many scripts of some classic movies such as Platoon. The relation between Montana and his sister is very well made and most of all realistic. Other screenwriter wouldn't have paid any attention on such thing when he has Pacino, great drug story, action and great lines. De Palma's direction is remarkable. The chainsaw scene was nicely directed. The very last scene - classic. The movie stresses on many human nature issues. Such as Montana's self confidence, prejudices, trust, friends. Many scenes show what is trust between Tony and his friends. The cliché about when a man becomes rich, he becomes a bad person is created delightful. Tony's power over other people make him degrade and that is where the movie becomes much more than a typical mob drama\/crime. The action scenes are great addition to the great story, but I find them rather being a great bonus then something the movie wouldn't have managed without.The score -perfect. Without stoppage, I say the score is something special. It fits in the movie in a unique way. I don't know how many times I have used a positive word in this review, but the movie deserves it. I really loved it and respected it.There will never be another movie like Scarface although this comes from the mouth of a person who prefers prefers Goodfellas to Scarface. Great director, one of the greatest actor of all time although far from my personal favorite and remarkable writer who is one big, big man and by big I don't mean size. Respect for Oliver Stone. If I had to describe the movie with one word, it would have been classic without any doubt.

Since Harry is an expert in surveillance, he knows there's something behind what these two people are saying. As the story unfolds and Harry's character develops, we realize that he may be in way over his head as he's lead into a world of intrigue and murder.Gene Hackman's performance is up there among his best and may only be beaten by his character in The French Connection. If you liked that film, then this will be up there on your favorites list as well. He plays Caul as if he's set on getting the character exactly right. Down to the pauses and nervousness that he gives off, Hackman is perfect for the role and shows that he's definitely one of the best actors of the past 50 years.But he's not the only one that shines in this haunting film. John Cazale's performance is something else to behold. Since he only made five films, one should cherish what he's made and what we get to see of him because every time he's on screen, we know that he can set the tone of a scene with just one line of dialogue. Cazale does just that in a perfect supporting role.Fredric Forrest and Cindy Williams play the two talkers who we know barely anything about, but, like Caul, we're sympathetic to them from the start. The more and more we hear of their conversation, the more and more we feel as if we know them. Since that's pretty much the only dialogue they have in the film, both actors knew to make the most of it and they certainly did.What makes this film stand out for me are the subtleties that we only see with further viewings. Of course, you only need one viewing to know that this is one of the greatest films ever made, but you'll like it even more if you watch it again a few years later. On a recent viewing I noticed that it opens with an aerial view of the park where the conversation takes place. Our eyes are fixed on a mime walking around and imitating the passing people. Only on this viewing did I realize the importance of this silent character in a film that's all about the sense of speech.With such perfectly executed continuity, brilliantly acted performances, and an excellent script, one must wonder why such an amazing film isn't as well remembered today. I can't give you the answer to that question, but I'm sure that anyone who sees it will wonder the same thing because they'll know that what they've just witnessed is a masterpiece that only the greatest of filmmakers could give you.

After you've watched it a few times and can anticipate all the plot machinations, you begin to wonder what director Hill & co are trying to sell you here. The film seems to be making the point that all men are thieves, and you can only trust a man who admits he's a thief. (And yes, I mean men, the women in this film are peripheral, although they're almost all treated respectfully.) That's a rather cynical message, and it makes The Sting very much a product of the time it portrays, the Depression, and the time it was made, the Watergate era.All subtext aside, it's a fun film, a brilliantly constructed entertainment. Newman and Redford, the most romantic couple of the early 1970s, are both fine, for the most part relying on their star power rather than their acting abilities. Robert Redford is not a great actor, but he's a great presence and Hill centers some nice images on him -- catching sight of the window where his best friend was just thrown to his death, getting cleaned up for the big con, dawdling in the street as he plots a romantic conquest. Newman is charismatic as ever and seems to be enjoying himself thoroughly, if perhaps at the expense of any menace or vulnerability we should be seeing in his character. As Lonerghan, the villain, Robert Shaw was cast to be somber, grouchy and loathsome, and he doesn't disappoint. Two of the most affecting characters are Luther and Alva Coleman, friends of Redford in Joliet who are very nice, God-fearing people as well as lifelong criminals. Hill could have probably made a smaller, darker movie about the Colemans if he had wanted, but not as many people would have gone to see it.After seeing the movie ten or twenty times, the mechanics of the storytelling can get a bit annoying -- the way Hill conceals the identity of Redford's mob stalker is pretty lame, since he never uses point-of-view camera work at any other time. Plus, the scene where Redford escapes from the cop by hopping the turnstile at a train station, dashing up the stairs and climbing onto the roof above the platform is fun to watch, but a little overdone. Would it really be so hard for Robert Redford to escape from Charles Durning?

First of all, I think that although the characters played by Marlon Brando and Montgomery Clift are meant to be portrayed in a differentiated way I still felt throughout the movie and throughout the book that we were only watching or reading about stereotypes. Montgomery Clift as the good Jew who is more American than the Americans themselves and the fact that he embraces all the values that America (thinks it) stands for was just too much to be true. When he goes back across the river to save the soldier who had beaten the s* out of him back in the American military station, I just couldn't help thinking So much neighborly love just doesn't exist. His bravery and his patriotism after all he endured in America and all the anti-semitism he was exposed to by his comrades just does not fly. Marlon Brando as the German character was rather evil and not at all portrayed in a differentiated way. While Noah loves his wife and only his wife, Marlon Brando is portrayed as the casanova who just tries to bang every woman he can and who doesn't care whether she is French or whether she is his lieutenant's wife. He is clearly depicted as a baddie and when he finally snitches on one of his comrades because he deserts the army, every one watching this movie surely thinks that the Brando character deserves to die. In the book the Dean Martin character dies, in the movie he survives. They probably did that to have the Americans believe that the victory they won over the Gremans was total and that only the baddies died whereas the goodies survive. All in all, I think the movie was just too much of a run-of-the-mill movie and did not deal with the issue of WW II as good as Catch-22 or Slaughterhouse No 5 did. Both the book and the movie try to rationalize an event which is everything but rational it is a truly despicable event that just shows what twisted minds people in high places have.

Montgomery Clift as the good Jew who is more American than the Americans themselves and the fact that he embraces all the values that America (thinks it) stands for was just too much to be true. When he goes back across the river to save the soldier who had beaten the s* out of him back in the American military station, I just couldn't help thinking So much neighborly love just doesn't exist. His bravery and his patriotism after all he endured in America and all the anti-semitism he was exposed to by his comrades just does not fly. Marlon Brando as the German character was rather evil and not at all portrayed in a differentiated way. While Noah loves his wife and only his wife, Marlon Brando is portrayed as the casanova who just tries to bang every woman he can and who doesn't care whether she is French or whether she is his lieutenant's wife. He is clearly depicted as a baddie and when he finally snitches on one of his comrades because he deserts the army, every one watching this movie surely thinks that the Brando character deserves to die. In the book the Dean Martin character dies, in the movie he survives. They probably did that to have the Americans believe that the victory they won over the Gremans was total and that only the baddies died whereas the goodies survive. All in all, I think the movie was just too much of a run-of-the-mill movie and did not deal with the issue of WW II as good as Catch-22 or Slaughterhouse No 5 did. Both the book and the movie try to rationalize an event which is everything but rational it is a truly despicable event that just shows what twisted minds people in high places have.

However, to me, Se7en will forever be the superior film.The plot, if you haven't seen or heard it before, concerns two detectives. One is old and about to retire while the other is new and fresh to the city. Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is as grizzled a veteran as can be imagined, his lined, elderly face folding into itself with the worries of life and the job in the city of Los Angeles (I think), a place he regards as Hell on Earth and which he is very happy to be retiring away from. Of course, like every cop on his way out (in Hollywood at least) Somerset has one last case to face, although it isn't his to take. Instead it's the property of a young buck, Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt) who initially treats it as 'just another nasty corpse,' in this case a man literally eating himself to death. Of course, where director David Fincher is involved, a tag like that is bound to be less than the whole story and, before long, a second body is discovered.Further plot explanations will only spoil the rest of the film, but stay put through the quiet, if edgy opening and you'll be hugely rewarded. This movie crackles with menace and, even before we meet the man responsible for all the carnage (Kevin Spacey's 'John Doe') you'll have experienced some truly horrifying, terror inducing moments. The fact that few if any of these are the product of screeching music or artificial suspense is a fine testament to Fincher's skill and the generally understated production of the film. Pitt isn't pretty, Somerset is hardly a benevolent mentor and Gwyneth Paltrow (as Mills' wife Tracy) is the epitome of be-trodden womanhood, someone whose former carefree existence in some quiet little town outside of LA has become a living nightmare inside of it.The cast really shine in this film, as does the director and just about everyone involved. At no point during proceedings are you entirely sure that another horror isn't right around the corner, this despite the fact that the majority of the seven atrocities are seldom even shown on screen. Fincher whets our appetite with almost graphic descriptions by junior policemen at the scene and lets the camera play over the locations of the murders just skirting the defiled corpses... but seldomly are we given the full visual. This technique actually makes the whole thing much more disturbing as your imagination is left to fill in the gaps. A corpse on film is seldom unpleasant after you've seen it once or twice. One tantalisingly close yet just out of sight can haunt you far more! And when Fincher cheekily allows himself one moment of surprise it bursts from the screen with all the greater force because of his earlier restraint.In this movie the acting, the atmosphere, the direction, the music, the plot and the pacing are all top notch and make this film a must have on DVD. Any criticisms I have are limited to a sense that there is a prevalence of style over substance in Se7en, something I think Fight Club also suffers from. The minimalist outlook and constant rain all make for a compelling atmosphere, but you only very occasionally get a feel for how big the case is. Instead it more often seems like an irrelevancy in the fast moving metropolis whereas, in fact, the murders are meant to ignite a media frenzy that ultimately leads to the films' incredible conclusion. But that is a minor quibble and one that you must probably accept with all Fincher's work.All in all this is a fantastic movie and the perfect antidote to the usual, asinine output from Hollywood (and since I'm writing this the day before Valentine's day I feel particularly vindicated in saying that!). Every cast member does their job perfectly, even the more extreme outbursts of emotion being delivered in such a way as to appear genuine, rather than the 'oh it's just an actor looking for an Oscar' pitches that I often feel when I see a modern, 'worthy' film. On top of that you seldom feel like your watching a movie. The director keeps many of his usual tricks to himself this time, instead giving us more of an insight into, rather than presentation of, three extraordinary days in the lives of two ordinary cops (Somerset and Mills). This understatement and holding back makes for a much better film and, while Fight Club may be cooler, Se7en is superior.Therefore my recommendation is if you haven't seen Se7en then do so at the earliest opportunity, though be warned... you'll need a friend close by soon after!

Ironically, it's more British than his British work is, and the great thing about it is that it brings out the spirit of the novel, as opposed to being typical Hitchcock work.What a cast! Laurence Olivier (my fave actor and god) as the sardonic Maxim de Winter, Joan Fontaine as the second Mrs de Winter, George Sanders as the blackmailing cadish Jack Favell, Judith Anderson as the evil Mrs Danvers, Reginald Denny as the faithful Frank Crawley, Gladys Cooper as Mrs Lacey, Nigel Bruce as Mr Lacey, there are several others but we will be here forever if I name them all. But what I am trying to say, EVERYONE in the cast is just so brilliant, you cannot single one out as a best performance when all these talented actors all give it their 100% best.The plot is done straightforwardly and not in the slightest bit difficult to understand, about a man who has been widowed for over a year, marries a young nervous girl and brings her to his mansion. however, the memory of Maxim de Winter's first wife 'Rebecca' who was loved by everyone but was a cruel, spitefull, shallow rebellious woman, is constantly kept alive by the sinister housekeeper Mrs Danvers (why Judith Anderson never won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for this I'll never know), the new wife and Maxim have to constantly battle against the dead Rebecca's popularity and it is a real scary journey for them, it's an alliance between a gawky virgin and a widowed sadist, a woman who's past is so blank that she doesn't even possess a name and a man who's past is so dark and horrible that he has contemplated suicide. You might find it a bit weird first time when you watch it, but honest to god, if you enjoy all genres of film, you will love this. As I said before, it is stupid to single out someone for giving the best performance in this film, but I suppose the one who commands your attention the most overall has to be Judith Anderson as Mrs Danvers. Perfect settings, perfect costumes and a perfect film. I have no issues with this film at all. I am now reading Daphne du Maruier's novel and am enjoying that too. The novel is loosely inspired by Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre, Joan Fontaine played Jane eyre in a 1944 production of Bronte's novel with Orson Welles but was nowhere near as good in that as she is in this. However, back to the point, great great film. Please watch it when you can, you will love it. Enjoy.*Laurence Olivier was immensely rude to Joan Fontaine and caused her weeks of misery during filming. Why?

Ironically, it's more British than his British work is, and the great thing about it is that it brings out the spirit of the novel, as opposed to being typical Hitchcock work.What a cast! Laurence Olivier (my fave actor and god) as the sardonic Maxim de Winter, Joan Fontaine as the second Mrs de Winter, George Sanders as the blackmailing cadish Jack Favell, Judith Anderson as the evil Mrs Danvers, Reginald Denny as the faithful Frank Crawley, Gladys Cooper as Mrs Lacey, Nigel Bruce as Mr Lacey, there are several others but we will be here forever if I name them all. But what I am trying to say, EVERYONE in the cast is just so brilliant, you cannot single one out as a best performance when all these talented actors all give it their 100% best.The plot is done straightforwardly and not in the slightest bit difficult to understand, about a man who has been widowed for over a year, marries a young nervous girl and brings her to his mansion. however, the memory of Maxim de Winter's first wife 'Rebecca' who was loved by everyone but was a cruel, spitefull, shallow rebellious woman, is constantly kept alive by the sinister housekeeper Mrs Danvers (why Judith Anderson never won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for this I'll never know), the new wife and Maxim have to constantly battle against the dead Rebecca's popularity and it is a real scary journey for them, it's an alliance between a gawky virgin and a widowed sadist, a woman who's past is so blank that she doesn't even possess a name and a man who's past is so dark and horrible that he has contemplated suicide. You might find it a bit weird first time when you watch it, but honest to god, if you enjoy all genres of film, you will love this. As I said before, it is stupid to single out someone for giving the best performance in this film, but I suppose the one who commands your attention the most overall has to be Judith Anderson as Mrs Danvers. Perfect settings, perfect costumes and a perfect film. I have no issues with this film at all. I am now reading Daphne du Maruier's novel and am enjoying that too. The novel is loosely inspired by Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre, Joan Fontaine played Jane eyre in a 1944 production of Bronte's novel with Orson Welles but was nowhere near as good in that as she is in this. However, back to the point, great great film. Please watch it when you can, you will love it. Enjoy.*Laurence Olivier was immensely rude to Joan Fontaine and caused her weeks of misery during filming. Why? He was p*ssed of the Vivien Leigh (his then wife) didn't have the part and took it out on Fontaine. When she informed of her recent marriage to actor Brian Aherne, he spat back 'Can't you do any better than him?' I'm surprised he wasn't hit.

The teachings of this military institution, molding young men 12 to 18 years old, have a profound effect, especially in the intense Brian Moreland, who is a clear favorite of the academy director, General Bache.Harold Becker directed Taps, which is based on a novel by Devery Freeman. The action of the film takes place in the fictional Bunker Hill Military Academy, that has just been sold to private investors who want transform the site into condominiums.With a history of having molded young minds during its distinguished history, Gen. Bache is horrified by the mere thought of losing the academy and the young people he has helped to involve in the rich life of the military. After a tragic incident that involves the killing of a townie, Bache suffers a heart attack, leaving the academy in the hands of people that are seen trying to undermine the fallen leader.Brian Moreland, the serious minded young man, takes it into his own hands to take care of what he thinks would be Gen. Bache's reaction in saving the school by getting the rest of the students left at the academy to hold it hostage and not give in to the upcoming changes, or to other people who don't have the same purpose in mind.Timothy Hutton is about the best thing going for the film. This young actor brought the right amount of seriousness, courage and valor to the role. This film is basically the big screen debut for Sean Penn and Tom Cruise, who went to build spectacular careers of their own. George C. Scott, another excellent actor is seen as Gen. Bache, but unfortunately, he doesn't have much to do and only appears in the opening sequences. Other familiar faces in the cast, Billy Van Zandt, Giancarlo Esposito.Taps is a film that shows how some young minds will act when they follow to the letter things they have learned in theory in the classroom. It also recognizes how honor could get a well meaning person to do things that he will regret later on and how it can cause harm to innocent young men that go along with these new leaders.

It started out fine, I was enjoying myself, well, not necessarily enjoying it, but I liked that it was mentally stimulating - I can respect that about Fight Club. But then the movie just turned....weird. The idea of these characters being part of an underground fight club was not a bad idea, but what the filmmakers did with it might have been. There was a book written about it, and the book focuses much more on the psychological aspect of all that is going on. Obviously, Fight Club is also a very intensely psychological film, but it doesn't seem to entirely know what it is doing with this.It is a movie with no particular teaching in mind or direction in its step. It is a movie in which the director, through intertwining suspense, violence and dialogue, tries to pound into the viewer some sort of questioning or some sort of thing to make us think. Unfortunately, because of the director's attempt to make the viewer ask questions, what comes onto the screen is a jumble of jargon, the focal point of which is the fighting, not the psychological aspects. Occasional mention of sex is thrown in liberally, and somehow made to fit into the plot line, but on the whole it seems kind of useless. The movie to me was just confusing and really not that great. Like I said, it's not a bad film, it just isn't all that.I like plot twists in movies, and the plot twist in Fight Club wasn't all that bad. In fact, it might have made the movie. But there were several factors that didn't work for me. One was the way the plot twist seemed just kind of tossed in there. I mean, obviously, it is integral to the whole story, but I could tell that if the entire storyline was looked at completely intensely, every piece would not fit into place. In the Sixth Sense, every last piece fit perfectly. In Fight Club, it obviously didn't. Also, the ending of the movie kind of spoiled the whole thing for me. The guy shoots himself in the mouth, stays alive for several minutes afterward, and everything continues on as it was going too, except for the fact that Edward Norton's character is going to die. What the heck!? The entire movie just seems confusing for the sake of being confusing. It believes that if a movie is thought-provoking, it is automatically classified as good. That is not necessarily true. I could take a bucket of truth and have characters in a movie speak several twisted versions of it, toss it into a setting, a story, and a climax, and call it a movie, but that doesn't mean it's good. Too much of Fight Club seems like this. Yes, it is very thought-provoking. My thoughts were provoked. Yet there is something integral missing, that piece of movie-making that makes other movies good, and the lack of it leaves Fight Club somewhere in that place between a strange movie and a great movie.
