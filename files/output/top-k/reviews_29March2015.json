[{"date":"29 March 2015","score":"","review":" Wow everyone! where to begin.. I just watched this movie and I really enjoyed it. It is deep and really touching. If you like movies about time-travel you will also love this. I think the actors and crew did such an amazing job on this movie. You must see it! This movie reminded me of my grandfather also, who was a HAM operator in '69. Normally I am always telling myself I should write a review about Movie Y or X but this movies was SO good that I had to go right to IMDb and write an honest review.I also have a background with HAM Radio so I think that this is part of the reason I like this movie so much. It makes me think about this in reality also. With Auroras in real-life it is possible to cover super-long distances. It's nice that this movie didn't fell like your typical scifi movie and felt natural. Of course it's a movie but this one felt quite possible which made it seem very real and touching.I will stop writing now, just watch it and don't forget to share your rating afterwords.
