I just posted some comments about Spun, which has some obvious similarities with this movie. I think this movie has more universal appeal, though, and for good reasons. To me, this is simply a fantastic film, and I'd recommend it to anyone.The four main characters are each likable, or at least very sympathetic, and we become very drawn in to their situations. And so, when things start to go horribly, horribly wrong, it does become painful to watch. Yet, one can't turn away, and I don't think it's just the auto-wreck you gotta look at effect. Here's my theory I have a good friend whose life has been, for several years, tragedy after tragedy, stupid mistake after stupid mistake, and unbelievably (literally!) bad luck after unbelievably bad luck.

The names attached to this project were quite good, as far as reputation went (even back in 1978), including Gene Hackman (Academy Award 1972), Marlon Brando (Academy Awards 1955 and 1973), John Williams (Academy Awards 1972 and 1976) and Mario Puzo (Academy Awards 1973 and 1975). Still I had doubts about this film. First of all, because I never was a fan of Superman and second of all, because I didn't know much about the character's history. All that was about to change though, as I settled in front of my TV set to watch 127 minutes of superhero history.As the film began I immediately recognized the style of music. This had to be John Williams and I must say that I liked the score, despite it resembled his work on Star Wars (released one year earlier) a bit. The music made the intro credits quite nice and I felt that I was off to a good start, a start whose quality was somewhat diminished by the part that followed. Now the acting in this part, by Marlon Brando in particular was pretty good, but the whole setting of the film, seemed to be something out of a Star Trek movie. Not that I mind such a thing in general, but I felt that there could have been a bit more explanation of for instance the sentencing of the culprits. There were other things there that could have been explained, but I'll get to that later. I found the music during Superman's travels to be quite annoying as well, but the film picked up after he had landed on earth. I was relieved and soon I began to lose my fear that this would be a standard sci-fi flick from the 70's. That fear though, would reoccur soon though, as Clark Kent left his elderly home and left for the world. Now this part, again, I didn't like too much, because it was not explained in great detail and because it could have been made better, just as the beginning of the film on Krypton. Luckily the film picked up in quality fast, as Kent became a grown man and Christopher Reeve took over the part of Clark Kent from Jeff East. From that point on the film became funny, thrilling and solid. The chemistry between Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder (Lois Lane) was amazing, as was Christopher Reeves ability to play the geeky Clark Kent and hero Superman (together with different tones of voice). The only thing that spoiled their on screen chemistry was actually the mind-reading part somewhere in the middle of the film. This was completely pointless and ruined a scene which could have been good if that part would have been left out or if it would have been handled otherwise (it should have been shorter in any case). Gene Hackman made another good performance as bad guy Lex Luthor. Now I admit that not all of his lines were funny, as I've read in other reviews, but at least they did not feel awkward as to the extent where you ask yourself &#145;What was the point of that?'. All in all the cast (I also enjoyed Ned Beatty's performance) was picked with great care and professionalism (although they were not always used properly) and I feel that if there would be an Oscar nod for best casting, this film should have gotten it.Now there are downsides to this film as well. I personally felt, that there was not enough explanation given to the audience at times. Of course we all understand how came to use that particular sign on his cape and we were told why he would have superpowers on earth etc., but there are still things that could have gotten a lot more explanation. How the heck, for instance, did Lex Luthor find out that Kryptonite would be harmful to Superman? Why is that so? How come Superman's father didn't warn him of that? I mean, he knew all about Superman's invincibility on earth due to different atmosphere! If he was so clever why didn't he mention that? I, as a person who has not much knowledge of the story surrounding Superman neither know the answers and the film nor can I derive them from the contents of the film as they were given me and personally I think that it is a big flaw of this film. The other flaws this film has, have to do more or less with the time in which the film was made. The rather bad effects and the overlong action scenes (as in the beginning with Krypton) are typical of most films made in the 70's. Now, the fact that the effects seem a bit outdated in this time and age doesn't bother me that much, but some of the action scenes in this film could really have been a bit shorter (as the Krypton scene in the beginning). Nonetheless this film had a number of well shot and timed action scenes as well and looking back at the film I cannot say that these minor flaws due to the decade in which was made undermined the overall entertaining and exiting nature of this film one bit. If some things would have been approached differently and there would have been more elaboration and explanation on some issues, this could have been a masterpiece. But even with those flaws it is one of the better films of it's decade and definitely worth a look if you are into superheroes, as it is in no way worse than this years Hulk.7 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"21 September 2003","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  In the wake of all the new superhero films being released and due to the fact that I did some delving into the 70's archive of film-making as well, I decided to see the &#145;original' Superman film with Christopher Reeve, before seeing any &#145;remake' due to be released some time soon no doubt.

And possibly uncontrollable laughter as well. No, I'm not being sarcastic, just wanted to warn everybody. I'm serious.I'm only just now checking out the James Bond flicks for the first time, and so far find them to be a mixed bag ranging from the fun to the spectacular to the boring to the incredibly stupid. But there was a moment while watching MOONRAKER when I realized that not only was I watching the stupidest of the Bond films, but that I was watching one of the most incredibly stupid scenes ever filmed in movie history I've encountered to date! (And as I am someone who loves to watch a ***lot*** of bad and stupid movies from PLAN 9 all the way through the MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATRE 3000 collection and way, way beyond, that's saying something!)In that one moment which had me laughing hysterically so hard that I swear I fell OUT of my chair and was rolling about on my living room floor clutches my sides because I could have sworn they had just split wide open while I was gasping for air as much as I could manage for fear I would suffocate on the hilarity of it all, the following happens within approximately two or three minutes of screen timeWhile on a gondola through Venice, James Bond suddenly presses a hidden button on it, causing a steering wheel to pop out and a motor to drop down into the water and suddenly the gondola thinks its a speedboat zooming through the canals at top speed, at one point plowing through another gondola consisting of a pair of lovers romantically smooching it up, causing the second struck gondola to be sliced neatly in two separating its passengers from the gondolier, and the gondolier is all frustrated and annoyed as he struggles to keep from sinking while the lovers drift away in their own still-afloat half of the ruined gondola still smooching it up and completely oblivious to everything that has just occurred, and suddenly as it approaches St. Mark's Square James's gondola grows a hovercraft device on the bottom of it and zooms through a crowd of people, and we see everyone around doing double takes and having cartoonish reactions to this ridiculous sight including a pigeon (!!!) doing a double-take and a dog narrowing his eyes in bewilderment...So help me, I SWEAR to you people, I am not making this up. I have a powerful reputation with all those who know and befriend me for being painfully honest about absolutely everything you might care to discuss with me. I would never dream of making this weirdness up. I'm a professional cartoonist, for pete's sake, and even *I* would never dream of creating a sequence like this, certainly not in a 007 flick! I've seen silliness in Bond movies before, but I have never, EVER seen anything THIS ridiculous! And it's all the more funny in that you are actually laughing AT the film as opposed to WITH it as was obviously intended.Well, so much for being the secretive, inconscpictuous, professional top spy.MOONRAKER is a movie in deep, deep trouble. This has, of course, become a notorious addition to the Bond franchise, an embarrassing mass of dunceness that raked in the cash for some weird reason while also simultaneously causing Bond fans everywhere to run gagging from the theatres. Don't ask me why it made as much as I hear it did; your guess is as good as mine. It is so goofy in so many different ways that I'm surprised it didn't kill the franchise off in one fair swoop upon its release! Its acting is terrible, its overall finale plot and effects manage to remind me just a tad too much of THE BLACK HOLE, only worse (and again, that's saying something!), to the point where I was checking the ending credits to see if Maximillian Shell was also playing this villainous character as well as the other one because both villains struck me as being too much the same for their own good. If you thought the black strings on the floating robots in THE BLACK HOLE were sloppy, wait until you see the effects done here in the space scenes! Or heck, even some of the earthbound ones like the rubber snake!Now we all know that James Bond movies on a usual basis have all the believability and depth of your average superhero comic book, but this movie goes beyond comic book level into the realm of the flat out cartoonish. Specifically, Warner Bros. territory. And while Jaws was previously terrifying in THE SPY WHO LOVED ME, here he's just completely daft both in conception and convincingness. By the time you see Jaws survive the cable car crash you'll realize that all those reviews you've read of MOONRAKER comparing him here to Wile E. Coyote were right on target. And any pretense of the movie's having one foot in reality at all, or even just one toe, goes flying madly out the window. The characters persistently do stupid things; the more-intelligent audience thinks of doing obvious alternatives way before anyone in the movie constantly ignores them. For example, at one point while Bond and Miss Goodhead (yes, it's another one of those entendre female monikers for a Bond girl) are in a cable car Jaws bites one of the cables which somehow causes Bond to topple. Which of course poses the obvious question if Jaws thought of biting the cables, why not simply bite a-l-l of them and send the entire cable car with Bond plummeting to its doom as opposed to jumping into another car and racing down after him? The movie is full of stupid things like this. I can't begin to tell you how little sense it makes.One other things I wish to note after seeing him in action against all the other Bonds, I have come to the conclusion with this movie that I simply do not like Roger Moore. I think the guy is simply too old-looking for the role and doesn't have either the personality or pizazz to play Bond. Connery and Bosnan are both so much better that they put this guy to shame.Another interesting note careful examination of the ending credits for THE SPY WHO LOVED ME will prove just how quickly rushed MOONRAKER really is. The announcement for the next movie doesn't say MOONRAKER--instead, it announces FOR YOUR EYES ONLY! Of course, I later learned that FYEO was the originally-planned next installment but that it was decided at the last minute to make MOONRAKER to cash in on the STAR WARS\/SCI-FI craze that had just appeared. This explains the sloppy script and effects. I personally would have enjoyed seeing what would have happened if this movie was carefully planned out and had a better Bond actor instead of what we got.All of this and much more has been pointed out by critics, rabid fans and pretty much everybody else who sees it, but that somehow didn't affect MOONRAKER's performance at the box office. But these days, I have to admit it has one interstellar virtue it's sure fun to put on during a party! With the right audience, MOONRAKER is one campy hoot.

Specifically, Warner Bros. territory. And while Jaws was previously terrifying in THE SPY WHO LOVED ME, here he's just completely daft both in conception and convincingness. By the time you see Jaws survive the cable car crash you'll realize that all those reviews you've read of MOONRAKER comparing him here to Wile E. Coyote were right on target. And any pretense of the movie's having one foot in reality at all, or even just one toe, goes flying madly out the window. The characters persistently do stupid things; the more-intelligent audience thinks of doing obvious alternatives way before anyone in the movie constantly ignores them. For example, at one point while Bond and Miss Goodhead (yes, it's another one of those entendre female monikers for a Bond girl) are in a cable car Jaws bites one of the cables which somehow causes Bond to topple. Which of course poses the obvious question if Jaws thought of biting the cables, why not simply bite a-l-l of them and send the entire cable car with Bond plummeting to its doom as opposed to jumping into another car and racing down after him? The movie is full of stupid things like this. I can't begin to tell you how little sense it makes.One other things I wish to note after seeing him in action against all the other Bonds, I have come to the conclusion with this movie that I simply do not like Roger Moore. I think the guy is simply too old-looking for the role and doesn't have either the personality or pizazz to play Bond. Connery and Bosnan are both so much better that they put this guy to shame.Another interesting note careful examination of the ending credits for THE SPY WHO LOVED ME will prove just how quickly rushed MOONRAKER really is. The announcement for the next movie doesn't say MOONRAKER--instead, it announces FOR YOUR EYES ONLY!

And possibly uncontrollable laughter as well. No, I'm not being sarcastic, just wanted to warn everybody. I'm serious.I'm only just now checking out the James Bond flicks for the first time, and so far find them to be a mixed bag ranging from the fun to the spectacular to the boring to the incredibly stupid. But there was a moment while watching MOONRAKER when I realized that not only was I watching the stupidest of the Bond films, but that I was watching one of the most incredibly stupid scenes ever filmed in movie history I've encountered to date! (And as I am someone who loves to watch a ***lot*** of bad and stupid movies from PLAN 9 all the way through the MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATRE 3000 collection and way, way beyond, that's saying something!)In that one moment which had me laughing hysterically so hard that I swear I fell OUT of my chair and was rolling about on my living room floor clutches my sides because I could have sworn they had just split wide open while I was gasping for air as much as I could manage for fear I would suffocate on the hilarity of it all, the following happens within approximately two or three minutes of screen timeWhile on a gondola through Venice, James Bond suddenly presses a hidden button on it, causing a steering wheel to pop out and a motor to drop down into the water and suddenly the gondola thinks its a speedboat zooming through the canals at top speed, at one point plowing through another gondola consisting of a pair of lovers romantically smooching it up, causing the second struck gondola to be sliced neatly in two separating its passengers from the gondolier, and the gondolier is all frustrated and annoyed as he struggles to keep from sinking while the lovers drift away in their own still-afloat half of the ruined gondola still smooching it up and completely oblivious to everything that has just occurred, and suddenly as it approaches St. Mark's Square James's gondola grows a hovercraft device on the bottom of it and zooms through a crowd of people, and we see everyone around doing double takes and having cartoonish reactions to this ridiculous sight including a pigeon (!!!) doing a double-take and a dog narrowing his eyes in bewilderment...So help me, I SWEAR to you people, I am not making this up. I have a powerful reputation with all those who know and befriend me for being painfully honest about absolutely everything you might care to discuss with me. I would never dream of making this weirdness up. I'm a professional cartoonist, for pete's sake, and even *I* would never dream of creating a sequence like this, certainly not in a 007 flick! I've seen silliness in Bond movies before, but I have never, EVER seen anything THIS ridiculous! And it's all the more funny in that you are actually laughing AT the film as opposed to WITH it as was obviously intended.Well, so much for being the secretive, inconscpictuous, professional top spy.MOONRAKER is a movie in deep, deep trouble. This has, of course, become a notorious addition to the Bond franchise, an embarrassing mass of dunceness that raked in the cash for some weird reason while also simultaneously causing Bond fans everywhere to run gagging from the theatres. Don't ask me why it made as much as I hear it did; your guess is as good as mine. It is so goofy in so many different ways that I'm surprised it didn't kill the franchise off in one fair swoop upon its release! Its acting is terrible, its overall finale plot and effects manage to remind me just a tad too much of THE BLACK HOLE, only worse (and again, that's saying something!), to the point where I was checking the ending credits to see if Maximillian Shell was also playing this villainous character as well as the other one because both villains struck me as being too much the same for their own good. If you thought the black strings on the floating robots in THE BLACK HOLE were sloppy, wait until you see the effects done here in the space scenes!

The story is about a general Maximus (Russell Crowe) who is chosen by emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) to become protector of Rome after his death. Instead he becomes a slave because the son of the emperor, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), kills his father before anybody knows his wish. Maximus is sold as a slave to Proximo (Oliver Reed) and he trains gladiators. Maximus has to make the crowd love him to make it to the Colosseum, to face Commodus who thinks Maximus is dead. Most of the story is fictional.There are a lot of good things in this movie and they almost make you forget the bad things. The movie opens with a battle between the army of general Maximus and a Germanian army. The set-up is great. We see how the Roman army is preparing for battle, with a lot of little details, and how the Germanian army arrives at the battlefield. After this the actual battle is a disappointment. Where everything looked great right before it all started, you can hardly see anything during the battle. Here the editing, cinematography and even direction or not very good.

Russell Crowe is great as Maximus, Joaquin Phoenix and Connie Nielsen, who is Commodus' sister Lucilla and an old love of Maximus, are very good as well and veterans as Derek Jacobi (as Senator Gracchus), the late Oliver Reed and the late Richard Harris simply disappear in their characters. The animated Rome looks great and new in one way but therefor a little too perfect, too animated, in another way. The battles in the arenas are pretty good, although the last one is a little too much fiction. You will know what I mean.

Meanwhile, industrialist Max Shreck is trying to gain support from the mayor and Bruce Wayne for a new power plant that will secretly be sucking power from Gotham City.  On top of all these events, Selina Kyle, Shreck's secretary, finds herself transformed into a new woman after he attacks her at the office.The second instalment in the Batman series continues Tim Burton's vision of an extremely dark and disturbing city, where criminals run rampant and are hunted down by the Batman.  I have read some viewers comments that this film is much, much darker than the first film, but I tend to disagree with them. I think they are equally dark, with the only reason this one seems darker is that the hero and the villains all wear black or grey outfits, as opposed to bright purple suits.Michael Keaton returns as Batman in this film, which is can only be seen as a good thing.  The difference between this film and the original Batman is that Keaton is now the leading man, with Nicholson out of the way and Danny DeVito, Christopher Walken and Michelle Pfieffer no where near reaching the greatness of the Joker.  This does not mean that their performances are bad, nothing could be further from the truth.  Pfieffer portrayed Catwoman very well, and Danny DeVito was excellent as the Penguin, although the changes the character went through compared to the old television series and the comics that I have read with him in it were quite substantial.  Never the biggest reader of the comics, (so I may be wrong about this), I can remember the Penguin as being just a short man with a long nose that loved birds and walked a bit like a penguin, instead of some circus freak that was abandoned at birth by his parents.Still, I accept the change to his character, and the changes that were made to Catwoman, as it makes for a few surprises, and does give the film a more mature tone (let's admit it, with all respect to Burgess Meredith, another version of the 60's Penguin would have reduced this film to a much lower level).  Plus, it creates a life of torment for the Penguin, who was thrown off a bridge when he was a baby and was forced to live with penguins at the Gotham City zoo, thus setting up a character that could definitely be believed to be warped into insanity.  Catwoman's creation, that of a lonely, klutz of a secretary, brought back to life by a horde of cats in an alley, giving her 9 lives, is not as believable, and the character does suffer has a result, although it does have its advantages with the confrontation she has with the three main men in the film.The story in this film is good for about the first 3 quarters, with the Penguin running for Mayor of Gotham City, but once this falls through, the film falls through, ultimately ending in a page out of the television show (if they could have done it), with the Penguin's penguins all armed with missiles and preparing to launch against Gotham.  The end? of Catwoman was perhaps the highlight of the final act of the film, although I must say that the character should have been brought back as a recurring character in the future films (but in saying that, I also think the future films should have been handled much, much more different).Batman Returns is nowhere near as good as Batman, but it is still good entertainment, if you are prepared to endure the movie falling apart at the end.  Danny Elfman returns to provide another great score, and the action sequences are once again well done.  Great performances by the 4 main characters and Michael Gough and Pat Hingle as Alfred and Commissioner Gordon make this a film that is worth watching, but I recommend it only to fans of the character or comic book films, or action movies in general, as the ending and some of the dialogue really detract from the experience.  6 out of 10.

It starts with a young girl (Drew Barrymore) alone, inside a house, when the phone rings. She picks it up and on the other end is a voice that strangely resembles Kiefer Sutherland in Phone Booth.Then we arrive in Woodsboro, a small, peaceful little town in the middle of nowhere.

Sidney (Neve Campbell) lives in Woodsboro. Today is the one-year anniversary of her mother's death, so she decides to go to a party with a bunch of drunken teens to celebrate - out of remorse, of course. At the party are a bunch of stoned idiots, but amongst them is Randy (Jamie Kennedy), a kid who knows everything about horror movies. There are certain rules one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie! he says. You can never have sex. You can't drink or do drugs. Never say, 'I'll be right back,' because you'll never come back. He knows all the tricks of a horror movie and how it works. He even knows when the apparently dead killer is going to come back for one last scare.Meanwhile, a cloaked killer starts to kill off the teens at the party. Now he's coming after Sidney. The deputy of the town, Dewey (David Arquette), stumbles around tracing down various clues while the party goes on. A news reporter, Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox Arquette) joins him and they fall into a ditch and kiss. Aw, how sweet. However, as a character from The Terminator once said, Nice night for a walk, eh? Probably not.Scream is revolutionary in more than a few ways. This is one of the only films I've ever seen where the characters in the movie actually speak of other movies, and the actors from the movies. Now people have gone to see movies in movies before, they've even discussed false movies, but in Scream they talk about *real* movies. For example, Randy is watching Halloween on TV and even starts talking about the first time Jamie Lee Curtis appeared nude in Trading Places (1983). His assumption is that she did not die in Halloween because by the rules of horror films, virgins do not die.There's even references to Norman Bates and Hannibal Lector at the end of the film. One character, in a crazed stupor, turns around and says, 'We all go a little crazy sometimes.' Anthony Perkins, 'Psycho.'There's a lot of blood in this movie. I liked it. It kind of adds a diabolical side to the film. People even stab each other to make it look like they've been attacked by a killer. I can't really say why or how this happens as it will ruin the movie, but let me just say when it happens, and the people are stabbing each other, the way and manner in which they do so is startling and quite sickening. It added a nice balance of darkness and humor to the movie. Bleeding and dying, a killer asks another character, Did you really call the police? My parents are gonna be so mad at me.I like movies that do this. I like movies where characters are aware of things. But Scream pushes past all boundaries and makes its characters so aware it's almost like watching real footage of real people. I really liked this. It would have been great to give Randy his own film where he could state all the different rules and cliches of horror films. But, if you've seen the second film, then I guess you know that it's too late to do that.4\/5 stars -John Ulmer ","genre":null},{"date":"21 September 2003","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  SpoilersThe secret of Scream is that its characters know they are in a horror movie.

This is one of the only films I've ever seen where the characters in the movie actually speak of other movies, and the actors from the movies. Now people have gone to see movies in movies before, they've even discussed false movies, but in Scream they talk about *real* movies. For example, Randy is watching Halloween on TV and even starts talking about the first time Jamie Lee Curtis appeared nude in Trading Places (1983). His assumption is that she did not die in Halloween because by the rules of horror films, virgins do not die.There's even references to Norman Bates and Hannibal Lector at the end of the film. One character, in a crazed stupor, turns around and says, 'We all go a little crazy sometimes.' Anthony Perkins, 'Psycho.'There's a lot of blood in this movie. I liked it. It kind of adds a diabolical side to the film. People even stab each other to make it look like they've been attacked by a killer. I can't really say why or how this happens as it will ruin the movie, but let me just say when it happens, and the people are stabbing each other, the way and manner in which they do so is startling and quite sickening. It added a nice balance of darkness and humor to the movie. Bleeding and dying, a killer asks another character, Did you really call the police? My parents are gonna be so mad at me.I like movies that do this. I like movies where characters are aware of things. But Scream pushes past all boundaries and makes its characters so aware it's almost like watching real footage of real people. I really liked this. It would have been great to give Randy his own film where he could state all the different rules and cliches of horror films. But, if you've seen the second film, then I guess you know that it's too late to do that.4\/5 stars -John Ulmer ","genre":"Horror, Mystery"},{"date":"21 September 2003","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  SpoilersThe secret of Scream is that its characters know they are in a horror movie. Life is just one big movie, one character says, right before a masked figure walks into the room and slashes him to pieces.I like movies that spoof the film industry. But I like films that spoof the notion of awareness even more. The characters in Scream are not making fun of horror movies, but rather they are aware that they are in one. And that's what makes it tick. Because if it took itself seriously, it would just be another stupid horror movie. It starts with a young girl (Drew Barrymore) alone, inside a house, when the phone rings. She picks it up and on the other end is a voice that strangely resembles Kiefer Sutherland in Phone Booth.Then we arrive in Woodsboro, a small, peaceful little town in the middle of nowhere. I am reminded of the town slogan in Back to the Future A nice place to live. Woodsboro seems like a nice place to live, one of those, If you lived here, you'd be home already! places. Sidney (Neve Campbell) lives in Woodsboro. Today is the one-year anniversary of her mother's death, so she decides to go to a party with a bunch of drunken teens to celebrate - out of remorse, of course. At the party are a bunch of stoned idiots, but amongst them is Randy (Jamie Kennedy), a kid who knows everything about horror movies. There are certain rules one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie! he says. You can never have sex. You can't drink or do drugs. Never say, 'I'll be right back,' because you'll never come back. He knows all the tricks of a horror movie and how it works. He even knows when the apparently dead killer is going to come back for one last scare.Meanwhile, a cloaked killer starts to kill off the teens at the party. Now he's coming after Sidney.

Minor SpoilersLaura was an entertaining film but lacked many things to make a great film noir. The atmosphere is there and the movie has other strengths too but it falls flat in other areas. Compared to the other film noirs I have seen, Laura is the least impressive. The major strength in the film comes from the performances of the three main actors. Dana Andrews is perfect as the detective. Vince Price also does a great job. Clifton Webb does a great job as the selfish Waldo. Gene Tierney does a good job as Laura, but out of the performances I have seen from women in film-noirs, she gives the least impressive. Judith Anderson is not much better than okay, I kept seeing Mrs. Danvers in her. The women who played the house keeper was constantly irritating. The dialogue is good, but pales in comparison to the likes of The Big Sleep. The film does contain its twist and turns like any other film-noir, which leads me to my next complaint. The first twist is that Laura is not dead, that was very surprising to me. However, to my surprise I was able to guess who the murderer was. It was no surprise that Waldo was the murderer, the personality of the character gave it away for me. There was no surprise at the end.

The rule of gunmen is ending with the new men of power being land owners and developers.  A young woman arrives in one such small town to find her new husband and family murdered by gunman Frank under the lead of a railroad developer.  Meanwhile a mysterious man arrives in the town looking for Frank for some reasons.  Both he and convict Manuel Gutierrez join forces to try and hold onto what remains of `their' west and deal with Frank.From the opening ten minutes you should be able to judge whether or not this film will frustrate you or not. The opening scene is one of the best of cinema but, on paper, very little actually happens.  This is what you need to carry into the film &#150; as it is so very long there is plenty of silence and pauses.  If you feel that these are unnecessary then the running time of this film will feel even longer to you.  On the other hand if you, as I do, feel that the silences in this film are just as important and telling as the dialogue or action, then this film should move quite quickly.The plot is a mix of revenge western while also looking at the death of the West associated with the American movies &#150; the strong gunman, the frontier town etc, they exist here but are being pushed out with every frame of the film.  What Leone manages to do which confounds me is he fills the film with so much silence but yet little of it brings boredom, instead the film has it's steady pace and never lets it dip into flagging but just keeps enough happening to keep things moving.  I must admit that some of the deeper meaning was lost on me but still felt that the central threads of the three or four main characters were more than enough to hold my interest on their own.  Of course, bits did work better than other bits but that is to be expected &#150; I know I got more from the cat and mouse between Harmonica and Frank than I did from the relationship between Gutierrez and Jill.  However these minor problems are lost in the sheer scale of the film itself.The acting is great and some of it could be considered the actors at their best.  Certainly I can't think of another role where Charles Bronson was required to do so well.  Here he has to have a stone face but still give over character &#150; he manages it and pulls off an iconic type of cool that I'd usually associate with big stars.  Fonda plays very naturally as a bad guy.  When I first saw this film I was quite young and hadn't seen a lot of his more famous roles, now that I have it is very strange to see him as a bad guy, but the counter casting of him does work anyway.  Cardinale is a strong role but I must confess that her character was lost to me a little &#150; this was one of the threads I was weakest on and I'll watch the film again with more focus.  Support cast are all pretty good and have a few famous western faces in there.One of the strongest parts of the film is the score.  From the first time you hear that scarring harmonica you know to associate it with bitterness, likewise other parts of the score are very strong and used well.  Part of it did remind me of Steptoe & Son but it still worked in it's context!  The plot all goes sort of where you expect it to but we are left with the wider picture of the West of Frank coming to an end and the West of Morton moving unstoppably to replace it &#150; the film never suggests that one is better than the other, in fact it highlights that there may be no difference at all.  Meanwhile the frontier men are pushed on into a shrinking horizon.Overall this is an epic, which means it is sweeping in scope, resulting in the occasional stretch showing.  The running time is sparsely filled with dialogue which may frustrate some, however Leone has made the silence as loud as the dialogue and the actors provide him with performances that deliver so much without words at times that the time is easily eaten up.

Griffin Mills (Robbins) has a nice life - a nice car, a nice girl, a nice job, and he's filthy rich.

And so he continues getting postcards and threats - someone even puts a poisonous snake in his car. Griffin becomes more and more paranoid as the days go on, and almost falls to the pressure of police questioning, led by Whoopi Goldberg.In-jokes flow freely.

It's a spoof on tinseltown and all its crazy little rituals of getting a film made. This could be called an anti-heroic movie - and I'm sure it has been called that. It's not for those who like poetic justice in their films. Good guys burn and bad guys win. At first I didn't like this, but then I realized that it isn't trying to be anti-heroic - it's being ironic. And let's face it Irony is funny.The Player reminds me very much of Adaptation (2002), the story of a writer played by Nicolas Cage who doesn't want to Hollywoodize his script about orchids. I just don't want to turn it into a Hollywood thing, he says. He says something to the effect of, No violence, no drugs, no sex, no people overcoming obstacles to succeed in the end. The irony is that, in the end, everything he didn't want to happen in his script happens. There's some of that irony in The Player, plus a little bit more. If you liked Adaptation, then you've got to see The Player. 5\/5.

The producers didn't make the same mistake again. Jason is a star and he is needed for this series. ( just ask the Halloween makers how much they needed Michael Myers after Halloween III ). Part 5 handled about a copycat killer and most fans of the series ( including myself ) didn't like this a single bit. The need for Jason was so big around this time that he came back enormously. More powerful and satanic than he ever was. I think this was THE movie in which Jason deserved his status of immortal horror icon the most.SMALL SPOILERS .... It's a fully grown up Tommy Jarvis ( the kid who beat Jason in part 4 ) who is responsible of the resurrection of Jason. It's his own goddamn fault, he should have left his grave alone instead of trying to send him to hell for good. Anyway, no complaints from me because this stands for the best opening in ALL Friday the 13th movies. Jason's corpse gets hit by lightening and not only is back among the living, he's now more powerful than ever. ( he rips of people's heads and arm like they are gingerbread men ). At the meantime, Camp Crystal Lake changed his name in favor to get rid of the bad reputation and opens its doors again. It's friday the 13th and they're are lots of counselors waiting to be slaughtered again...the ideal Vorhees atmosphere. Tommy is having trouble to explain it all to the local sheriff but the daughter is willing to help him. Tommy thinks he can only finish Jason once and for all by bringing him back to the exact same place where he died at young age. Of course that easier said than done... END SPOILERS !!!The bigger budget obviously saved this episode. We get to see a lot more Jason than we ever did before and his killing spree is shown much more detailed. Every slasher fans dream, in other words. The plot is of course dumb and far from original but few people care about that, I think. The writers did try to come up with a few nice elements ( for example the actual presence of young children which helps to build up the tension ) but, in general, the story is too weak to speak about a good horror film.

The girl who plays Megan ( Jennifer Cooke) and the sheriff ( David Kagen ) belong to the best actors this series had so far.

Had not seen this since its theatrical release in 1983.  Now 20 years later, I couldn't resist the theatrical re-release.

The periodic laughter from the audience was the telling sign of how times have changed.  We have become numb to the violence and drug abuse.  However, PLEASE note, this is NOT A MOVIE FOR KIDS.  There were at least 6 kids under 10 years old in the theatre.  Yes, times have changed, but not that much!  Michelle Pfeiffer's performance looks even better now as the lonely ice queen of the drug lords.  Watching Stephen Bauer reminds me that I predicted stardoom for him 20 years ago.  Oh well, can't always be right.  Oliver Stone's screenplay is excellent and for the most part, this is DePalma's best direction.  However, in usual DePalma fashion, he goes over the top every time he wants to emphasize Pacino's anger.  The close-ups of the eyes and the increased volume would be necessary for a lessor actor, but not Pacino in his prime.

After having watched ~30 minutes of this, I was struck by the sinister urge of writing the most abusive review ever. Folks - this is a movie from the year 1997, A.D. Anachronism of this sort belongs to the 70s\/80s, not to the nineties; the worst kind of clichés and stereotypes displayed here instantly force you to recall flicks such as Red Heat, Rocky IV, the Bond movies that dealt with the Soviet regime, you name it.

My condolences to the people who sat at any of the movie theaters in Russia, forced to watch (and listen) Oldman reading out his manifesto (nonsense supposed to be ultranationalist`) with one of the most horrendous Russian accents heard since Dolph Lundgren opened his trap in Rocky IV. (Yoo vill ceess yoor military eskort...) Worse still, due to the thick English accent, the Russian that Gary and his henchmen speak does not even remotely sound Russian. Do NOT tell me that there weren't any real Russian actors available for the job.

Heavy miscastings\/performances and blatantly stereotypical characters sum up  the worst silver screen ridiculing of Russians I've ever witnessed )Glenn Close is truly annoying (yet another unpleasant surprise), she really could have dropped that metallic, aggressive voice of hers. Oh, and every scene that involves the West Wing following the President's progress deserves extra credit for the worst overdramatization EVER. The feeling that someone would suddenly spring up and gasp the He's a MADMAN! line from Spy Hard was constantly almost palpable.The plot has nothing to it, really. There is no tension, no entertainment value, nothing. Hijackers shooting hostages - for heaven's sake, by now we have probably all seen Die Hard or Under Siege, why repeat all that? The rest consists mainly of the underperforming Oldman, ranting in his Anglorussian and the overperforming Ford, sneaking about and nailing one dead-stupid baddie after another, spouting daft Stallonean one-liners here and there(I'm counting on you, red, white and blue or Get off my plane!). The movie gradually gets cornier towards the end and the plot acquires even more laughable dimensions. (My favourite being the dreadful Parachuting Scene that probably defies every law of physics available and provides the viewer with some hearty laughs as the happily smiling staff people float across the blue screen). I lost count on how many brave US patriots (including the effete William H. Macy) willingly took a bullet for the superhuman President Ford in this movie. Why, God, why? And if there actually was any political message concealed here, one more complex than Do NOT mess with the US - yes, especially you, reds then I surrender, it was beyond me.Gah, I could rant and rave on forever, but what's the point?

(Yoo vill ceess yoor military eskort...) Worse still, due to the thick English accent, the Russian that Gary and his henchmen speak does not even remotely sound Russian. Do NOT tell me that there weren't any real Russian actors available for the job. (And what's with that bloke who played the silly Soviet scientist in MacGyver running around and suddenly being a hardcore terrorist?) Heavy miscastings\/performances and blatantly stereotypical characters sum up  the worst silver screen ridiculing of Russians I've ever witnessed )Glenn Close is truly annoying (yet another unpleasant surprise), she really could have dropped that metallic, aggressive voice of hers. Oh, and every scene that involves the West Wing following the President's progress deserves extra credit for the worst overdramatization EVER. The feeling that someone would suddenly spring up and gasp the He's a MADMAN! line from Spy Hard was constantly almost palpable.The plot has nothing to it, really. There is no tension, no entertainment value, nothing. Hijackers shooting hostages - for heaven's sake, by now we have probably all seen Die Hard or Under Siege, why repeat all that? The rest consists mainly of the underperforming Oldman, ranting in his Anglorussian and the overperforming Ford, sneaking about and nailing one dead-stupid baddie after another, spouting daft Stallonean one-liners here and there(I'm counting on you, red, white and blue or Get off my plane!). The movie gradually gets cornier towards the end and the plot acquires even more laughable dimensions. (My favourite being the dreadful Parachuting Scene that probably defies every law of physics available and provides the viewer with some hearty laughs as the happily smiling staff people float across the blue screen). I lost count on how many brave US patriots (including the effete William H. Macy) willingly took a bullet for the superhuman President Ford in this movie. Why, God, why? And if there actually was any political message concealed here, one more complex than Do NOT mess with the US - yes, especially you, reds then I surrender, it was beyond me.Gah, I could rant and rave on forever, but what's the point? What I can say is that if you have somehow managed to miss the overacted, atrocious uberpatriotic piece of garbage that is Air Force One, consider yourself lucky. Clearly, this is THE stupidest picture given the green light to. Well done, Hollywood, congrats, Wolfgang. 1\/10 (1 point for the unparalleled amusement value).

He was absolutly mesmerizing that I could hardly believe it was coming from an act. Especially the scene where Lester looks inside the fridge to get a bottle of rootbeer. That one moment where he looks at Angela(Mena Suvari)was amazing, not forgeting at the end, just before he gets killed, that expression in his face when he says, I'm great, not knowing that several seconds later he would be dead. The other performances were exellent aswell. Annette Benning was brilliant as Lester's self obsessed wife, along with Thora Birch, Wes Bently and Mena Suvari, who were all fantastic too, but the best of the supporting cast has to go to Chris Cooper who, in my opinion, was snubbed at the Academy Awards.

I didn't watch 'Sugar Town' because of Anders, and certainly not because of her co-director Kurt Voss! (- shudder - I've actually seen 'Below Utopia') I only watched it because of its odd cast of former rock stars (ex-members of Duran Duran, Redd Kross, X and Spandau Ballet) and Rosanna Arquette (who I like) and Ally Sheedy (who I don't). The cast was so offbeat I was intrigued. The movie, despite my initial suspicions, wasn't a complete stinker, but neither was it an unheralded gem. The comparisons to 'Magnolia' on the back sleeve were really pushing it, I must say! Yes, the two share a similar multi-character story line, which owes a lot to Robert Altman anyway, but 'Sugar Town' is nowhere near as powerful as 'Magnolia'. It's a very light movie with little insight into human behavior. It's basically a comedy after all, concerning various people on the periphery of the L.A. music biz, some has beens and some wanna be's. There are a few amusing sequences, especially from Arquette and Michael Des Barres, but this isn't anything life changing. I can still vividly remember sequences from 'Grace Of My Heart' after five years, but I sincerely doubt I'll recall much of 'Sugar Town' after five MONTHS. It's a reasonably entertaining movie, but a pretty forgettable one.
