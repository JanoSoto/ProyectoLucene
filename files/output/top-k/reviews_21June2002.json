(I am tough with my ratings.  I currently have voted for 909 titles, and have only given out 25 10's.)  If you get the opportunity to see the directors cut of this movie, do yourself a great favor and do so.  It adds incredible depth to the characters.   When I saw this originally, I found Penny Lane (Kate Hudson) to be one of the least interesting characters in it, however the directors cut gives her character much needed depth.  She comes across as someone who truly wants to escape her persona of Penny, and just return to a normal life.  She is unable to do so, as the pulls of peer pressure and love keep her going.Many of the other performances in this movie are as good as they get.  Patrick Fugit has a breakout performance as William, the lead character.    It is interesting to watch his evolution from a little boy to a man.  Watch for the transformation in his character's mood after the scene, about halfway through the movie, where he loses his virginity.  Wonderfully performed, as was his conflict to do the right thing, while still learning.Frances McDormand pulls off a near-perfect performance as Williams over-protective and over-bearing mother, who goes through the turmoil of realizing that her children have grown beyond her care.  Don't overlook Jason Lee, whose turn as lead singer Jeff Bebe is well played as well.Cameron Crowe, the director, controls the mood of this movie in such a way that you are always interested.  Humor and drama are well-woven.  For every valley, there is an accompanying peak that pulls you along. This movie is poignant, funny, heart-warming, and lets us all re-live the turmoil of youth conflict.

The story wasn't very convincing, which normally wouldn't be a problem, but what I found was the biggest problem, was that I didn't care about any of the characters. First you have this kid named Alan who works for his father in a toy store. He seems to have this reputation around school, but while that got fully explained really quickly, it was built up so much; you thought there would be more to it. Then you have this girl he really likes (for no apparent reason than because she's beautiful, but I guess that's not too much of a problem) named Christy. But she has a boyfriend, so you figure there'd be this love triangle thing going on, but it never happens. So then you have these toys. Toys that have been implanted with a smart chip built by the military. They have the ability to talk, talk back, and learn. So one set of toys (the Commando Elite) is programmed to attack and kill the other set of toys (the Gorgonites). Sound exciting? Well, it isn't.So what is this movie about? Is it about this boy Alan, trying to win the girl? Is it about him tyrying to win his fathers acceptance? Is it about these toys called the Gorgonites? What the hell is this movie about? It seems it's only about toys killing toys, and if people get in the way, kill the people. This movie was not funny. So don't go in thinking it'll be like Toy Story or Toy Story 2 because it isn't like either of those films. Both those films were entertaining. And more importantly, both those movies had heart, and characters you cared about. I could have cared less if Alan got the girl, or saved the poor little Gorgonites. And speaking of the Gorgonites, I was getting a little tired of the leader of the Gorgonites (Archer) complaining all the time of how they were programmed to lose. Did he lose? Hell no. He won! Not only that, while all the other toys seemed to get destroyed, him and his band lived. All because they were covered partially by a satellite dish? Please. The only redeeming thing about this movie was the computer animation. It is remarkable how they can make things look so real. The toys really did come to life on the screen. But other than that, this movie had the chance of being really good, but instead fell flat on its face. Give me characters I care about. Or give me a real story.

It's not because of its overall poor quality, but because this time, Jason is an imposter; a man seeking revenge for the death of his son. This fact is not revealed until the very end, but since it is such common knowledge among genre fans, I feel blameless in discussing it here. The truth is, the film is so arbitrary that it would have made no difference even if Jason had truly risen from his grave, where he must have been rolling for the duration of the film. Director Danny Steinmann seems to be aiming for a murder mystery type of story, suggesting that the killer may be a mental patient or some redneck. However, this element is so ineptly handled that it simply doesn't matter. It's just a bad slasher movie that lurches from one kill scene to another, peopled with cartoonishly obnoxious characters who deserve what they get. There's plenty of gore and female nudity, but even then, it never rises from the muck.For the most part, the performances are strictly amateur night, although John Shepherd does a decent job as Tommy Jarvis, a decade or so after part 4. Shavar Ross does his best, though kid characters in horror movies are almost always annoying. (Exception Halloween) Melanie Kinnaman is okay; at least she doesn't embarrass herself. Otherwise, most of the actors, who shall remain nameless, deserve to have their SAG cards torn up, especially that Michael Jackson wannabe. Why do actors do these movies anyway? Are they that desperate for the money? Don't they know that appearing in a Jason flick is a guaranteed career-killer? I think one actress was denied a promising role in an Oliver Stone film for that reason. To be fair, there's little that can be done with such poor material.The only good part is the flashback in the beginning, featuring a cameo by Corey Feldman.

Cool and violent. There's not much else to say. The plot is paper thin, the characters aren't spectacular (other than Shaft himself). The music rocks, and the sound is very good. So basically you go to see this movie because it's cool, and it's violent.Samuel L. Jackson is John Shaft. Not to be confused with the original John Shaft played by Richard Roundtree in the original classic films. Jackson's Shaft is the nephew of the original Shaft, a relationship that has nothing to do with the story. In fact there's nothing in the original that has anything to do with the current movie besides the name. The original came out in 1971, so most of us young audience has no idea who the hell Shaft is, so why would they care that Jackson plays the nephew of Roundtree? Just something I thought about before even seeing the movie.So anyway, Shaft is a detective in the NY Police Department. He picks up this case where a white man kills a black man in a racial incident. The white guy, Walter Wade (Christian Bale) manages to get bail on the murder rap, and leaves the country for two years. Then he decides to come back feeling that he can beat the charge because the one witness (Toni Collette) has been scared away. But Shaft isn't going to play that game. So he goes out to try and track down the witness and have her testify against Wade. Along the way Shaft runs into problems with every person imaginable, including members of his own police force and a local Dominican drug lord, Peoples (Jeffrey Wright). So what's the plot exactly? I suppose it's supposed to be Shaft trying to get the woman to testify, while Wade wants to try and shut her up. I didn't think it was that crucial to have her testify, considering Wade had blood on his hands from the murder, I assume there were fingerprints on the weapon, and he basically admitted to the killing to Shaft 30 seconds into the movie. So why is it so important to prosecute him with this woman's testimony? They could have made the case easily without her, in my opinion. So the story to me wasn't all that strong, it was basically an excuse to have Shaft run wild in New York. Oh yeah, at one point Shaft leaves the police force, so most of what he does is as a private detective. Going around shooting people, threatening street punks, all sorts of things that you and I would be thrown in jail for. So get over it, you might say. This isn't a movie that's story driven, it's character driven. It's all about John Shaft and how cool he is. And there is no question about that. Samuel L. Jackson is as cool as they come. And even though everything he does would land us in jail, he looks cool doing it. Whether it's getting the ladies or beating up the bad guys, he's always got the right thing to say (`It's my duty, to please that booty'), and the right attitude to back it up. I loved Busta Rhymes as his friend Rasaan, and I think Christian Bale is a great actor. Jeffrey Wright got a lot of laughs in the movie though because of his extremely strong accent (Tiger Wooooods). But his character was very powerful and I did enjoy him. Dan Hedaya playing a corrupt cop is almost something I expect to see. As soon as I saw he was a cop, in the back of my mind I was thinking, well he's going to go bad (and I don't think I'm ruining the movie by giving that away).Vanessa Williams is also in here, although I don't know why. Her role was very small and almost inconsequential. I suppose they needed at least one strong female character in there, so why not throw her in?Then there was the violence. Now I personally am a big fan of movie violence. Give me a good shootout or fight scene and I'm a happy camper. And there was plenty of gun violence in this movie. At almost every turn someone was getting shot. Hell, by the end of the movie I don't think there was anyone that hadn't been shot. Besides Shaft of course. He's a bad mother... Shut your mouth! Sorry, had to be done sometime... So if you love shoot em ups, you'll dig this flick. And lastly there was the music. If there's one song that can stand the test of time, it's Isaac Hayes' classic theme song. His new version is a very simple remake of the original. No guest stars, no tweaking of the formula, just a straight remake. And having that music play over certain scenes just makes you smile. Because it's so cool.I'd say I thoroughly enjoyed Shaft. The story wasn't strong, but for this kind of movie, that doesn't matter. What matters is that it stars Samuel L. Jackson as that bad mother... shut your mouth! Shaft. Very violent, at times very funny, and most of all, very cool...  ","genre":null},{"date":"21 June 2002","score":"","review":"  Violent would also be a good word to use. Cool and violent.

But his character was very powerful and I did enjoy him. Dan Hedaya playing a corrupt cop is almost something I expect to see. As soon as I saw he was a cop, in the back of my mind I was thinking, well he's going to go bad (and I don't think I'm ruining the movie by giving that away).Vanessa Williams is also in here, although I don't know why. Her role was very small and almost inconsequential. I suppose they needed at least one strong female character in there, so why not throw her in?Then there was the violence. Now I personally am a big fan of movie violence. Give me a good shootout or fight scene and I'm a happy camper. And there was plenty of gun violence in this movie. At almost every turn someone was getting shot. Hell, by the end of the movie I don't think there was anyone that hadn't been shot. Besides Shaft of course. He's a bad mother... Shut your mouth! Sorry, had to be done sometime... So if you love shoot em ups, you'll dig this flick. And lastly there was the music. If there's one song that can stand the test of time, it's Isaac Hayes' classic theme song. His new version is a very simple remake of the original. No guest stars, no tweaking of the formula, just a straight remake. And having that music play over certain scenes just makes you smile. Because it's so cool.I'd say I thoroughly enjoyed Shaft. The story wasn't strong, but for this kind of movie, that doesn't matter. What matters is that it stars Samuel L. Jackson as that bad mother... shut your mouth! Shaft. Very violent, at times very funny, and most of all, very cool...  ","genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller"},{"date":"21 June 2002","score":"","review":"  Violent would also be a good word to use. Cool and violent. There's not much else to say. The plot is paper thin, the characters aren't spectacular (other than Shaft himself). The music rocks, and the sound is very good. So basically you go to see this movie because it's cool, and it's violent.Samuel L. Jackson is John Shaft. Not to be confused with the original John Shaft played by Richard Roundtree in the original classic films. Jackson's Shaft is the nephew of the original Shaft, a relationship that has nothing to do with the story. In fact there's nothing in the original that has anything to do with the current movie besides the name. The original came out in 1971, so most of us young audience has no idea who the hell Shaft is, so why would they care that Jackson plays the nephew of Roundtree? Just something I thought about before even seeing the movie.So anyway, Shaft is a detective in the NY Police Department. He picks up this case where a white man kills a black man in a racial incident. The white guy, Walter Wade (Christian Bale) manages to get bail on the murder rap, and leaves the country for two years. Then he decides to come back feeling that he can beat the charge because the one witness (Toni Collette) has been scared away. But Shaft isn't going to play that game. So he goes out to try and track down the witness and have her testify against Wade. Along the way Shaft runs into problems with every person imaginable, including members of his own police force and a local Dominican drug lord, Peoples (Jeffrey Wright). So what's the plot exactly? I suppose it's supposed to be Shaft trying to get the woman to testify, while Wade wants to try and shut her up. I didn't think it was that crucial to have her testify, considering Wade had blood on his hands from the murder, I assume there were fingerprints on the weapon, and he basically admitted to the killing to Shaft 30 seconds into the movie. So why is it so important to prosecute him with this woman's testimony? They could have made the case easily without her, in my opinion. So the story to me wasn't all that strong, it was basically an excuse to have Shaft run wild in New York. Oh yeah, at one point Shaft leaves the police force, so most of what he does is as a private detective. Going around shooting people, threatening street punks, all sorts of things that you and I would be thrown in jail for. So get over it, you might say. This isn't a movie that's story driven, it's character driven. It's all about John Shaft and how cool he is. And there is no question about that. Samuel L. Jackson is as cool as they come. And even though everything he does would land us in jail, he looks cool doing it. Whether it's getting the ladies or beating up the bad guys, he's always got the right thing to say (`It's my duty, to please that booty'), and the right attitude to back it up.

One name that instantly pops out is Alfred Hitchcock, but although he is still considered the master of suspense, his films are now dwarfed by big-budget Hollywood action movies with stellar special effects. In my opinion, Billy Wilder's films have aged the least. In today's tradition of gross-out movies, his classic comedy Some Like It Hot still brings out the laughs and was recently named by the American Film Institute as the funniest American movie of all time. His Oscar-winning movie The Apartment still feels original, and its influence is still seen today-Sam Mendes cited it as an inspiration in making American Beauty. Wilder made many other classics, but arguably, his best film was 1950's Sunset Boulevard. This movie is about Hollywood; it reflects how the movie business has changed in that period when silent films have given way to talkies. It shows an aging silent film star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), who, even though rich, still wants the fame and glory she once had. She is now isolated in her mansion, accompanied only by her butler Max (Erich von Stroheim), her house filled with pictures from the past, and she watches her past films in her own theater. She dreams of making a comeback, writing a ridiculous script, and hoping to send it to Cecil B. DeMille and make him direct it.The movie is seen from the point of view of Joe Gillis (William Holden). His character was well established-a struggling writer in need of fast money because he needs to pay his rent and keep his car. The studio rejects his script; he ends up asking various people for money, and fails. We are not surprised that when Norma asks him to edit her script and requests him to live in her house, he accepts. Later, when Norma admits that she is falling in love with him, he first despises the idea, but eventually ends up with her because he needs the money likes the lifestyle. The screenplay is very much well written because it develops almost every character. The butler Max plays a deeper role in the story that it may seem, and I will let the viewers find that out for themselves. A woman named Betty Schaefer also plays an important role; she is the younger attractive woman Gillis falls for but cannot pursue because she is engaged and also because Gillis cannot get out of his relationship with Norma.The movie's score by Franz Waxman impressed me. The music enters at the right moments, and it sets the tone for the entire movie. The casting is somewhat interesting. Swanson was also a silent film star and at one point in the movie, Norma and Gillis watches a movie called Queen Kelly with the young Swanson, and at that time, it seemed like Swanson was playing herself. The butler Max, admits that he was once a promising director `There were three young directors who showed promise in those days, D.W. Griffith, Cecil B. DeMille and Max von Mayerling.' This is interesting because Erich von Stroheim was also a director, and more interestingly, he directed Swanson in Queen Kelly. In a scene where Norma invites her silent film friends to play bridge, the parts were played by real silent film stars-Buster Keaton, Anna Q. Nilsson and H.B. Warner. The real backbone of this movie is Gloria Swanson's amazing performance. She makes her character tiptoe the line of insanity, and she convincingly fell through it in the end. I enjoyed the way she overacts sometimes, showing us that Norma still lives in the past, doing pantomime for silent films. When Gillis told her that she used to be big, she immediately answers, `I am big. It's the pictures that got small.' She also impersonates Chaplin's tramp at one point, and it provided one of the biggest laughs of the movie.A minor drawback in the movie occurs in the beginning, where one important plot development is revealed. I believe that the movie could have been a little better if Wilder used a straight narrative rather than starting close to the end and tell the story in one big flashback. I still give this movie a perfect grade because it still works well even with the minor mistake, and it also deeply entertained me. Sunset Boulevard, like Singin' in the Rain, uses an important event in movie history and develops it not just into a great movie, but one of the greatest movies of all time.

In my opinion, Billy Wilder's films have aged the least. In today's tradition of gross-out movies, his classic comedy Some Like It Hot still brings out the laughs and was recently named by the American Film Institute as the funniest American movie of all time. His Oscar-winning movie The Apartment still feels original, and its influence is still seen today-Sam Mendes cited it as an inspiration in making American Beauty. Wilder made many other classics, but arguably, his best film was 1950's Sunset Boulevard. This movie is about Hollywood; it reflects how the movie business has changed in that period when silent films have given way to talkies. It shows an aging silent film star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), who, even though rich, still wants the fame and glory she once had. She is now isolated in her mansion, accompanied only by her butler Max (Erich von Stroheim), her house filled with pictures from the past, and she watches her past films in her own theater. She dreams of making a comeback, writing a ridiculous script, and hoping to send it to Cecil B. DeMille and make him direct it.The movie is seen from the point of view of Joe Gillis (William Holden). His character was well established-a struggling writer in need of fast money because he needs to pay his rent and keep his car. The studio rejects his script; he ends up asking various people for money, and fails. We are not surprised that when Norma asks him to edit her script and requests him to live in her house, he accepts. Later, when Norma admits that she is falling in love with him, he first despises the idea, but eventually ends up with her because he needs the money likes the lifestyle. The screenplay is very much well written because it develops almost every character. The butler Max plays a deeper role in the story that it may seem, and I will let the viewers find that out for themselves. A woman named Betty Schaefer also plays an important role; she is the younger attractive woman Gillis falls for but cannot pursue because she is engaged and also because Gillis cannot get out of his relationship with Norma.The movie's score by Franz Waxman impressed me. The music enters at the right moments, and it sets the tone for the entire movie. The casting is somewhat interesting. Swanson was also a silent film star and at one point in the movie, Norma and Gillis watches a movie called Queen Kelly with the young Swanson, and at that time, it seemed like Swanson was playing herself. The butler Max, admits that he was once a promising director `There were three young directors who showed promise in those days, D.W. Griffith, Cecil B. DeMille and Max von Mayerling.' This is interesting because Erich von Stroheim was also a director, and more interestingly, he directed Swanson in Queen Kelly. In a scene where Norma invites her silent film friends to play bridge, the parts were played by real silent film stars-Buster Keaton, Anna Q. Nilsson and H.B. Warner. The real backbone of this movie is Gloria Swanson's amazing performance. She makes her character tiptoe the line of insanity, and she convincingly fell through it in the end. I enjoyed the way she overacts sometimes, showing us that Norma still lives in the past, doing pantomime for silent films. When Gillis told her that she used to be big, she immediately answers, `I am big. It's the pictures that got small.' She also impersonates Chaplin's tramp at one point, and it provided one of the biggest laughs of the movie.A minor drawback in the movie occurs in the beginning, where one important plot development is revealed. I believe that the movie could have been a little better if Wilder used a straight narrative rather than starting close to the end and tell the story in one big flashback. I still give this movie a perfect grade because it still works well even with the minor mistake, and it also deeply entertained me. Sunset Boulevard, like Singin' in the Rain, uses an important event in movie history and develops it not just into a great movie, but one of the greatest movies of all time.

The division's ability to stop murders before they happen is based on the psychic ability of three people who were mutant byproducts of a failed genetic program designed to help babies born from drug-dependent mothers. Cruise's character, John Anderton, is motivated by the loss of his own son, who was abducted and murdered six years earlier. Accordingly, he's a strong supporter of the controversial program, whose opponents feel it could potentially make an error and people might be wrongfully convicted, if not potentially rehabilitated. That action begins when Anderton is identified as a future killer, and he hits the road running. This may sound a little like The Fugitive, but in this case, you don't know if the man on the run is--or, rather, will be--guilty.Based on a short story by futurist Phillip K. Dick, author of Blade Runner, the atmosphere of a dark world with high technology having gotten out of hand, almost as though it snuck up on us without our knowing, remains the theme. To remind us that we aren't controlled by technology, but are nonetheless overrun by it, there are frequent references to current-day familiarities, such as department stores and restaurants, such as The Gap and McDonalds, where impressively entertaining high-tech mass marketing gadgets know what you've purchased before and offer new suggestions for consideration. (Sounds like a visit to amazon.com?) Spielberg lightens up the tone with his signature wit and humorous quips and visuals now and then, as opposed to Ridley Scott's more serious and consistently dark visualization portrayed in Blade Runner.As a plotline, Minority Report is intelligent, has a good consistent flow, isn't always predictable (at least not that long before it happens), has many twists and turns with legitimate dead-ends, and above all, tells a plausible story (even if the basic premise itself requires considerable suspension of disbelief). As Anderton begins to unravel the true story about the corruption behind the pre-crime program, he is lead even further towards his destination as predicted by the `pre-cognitives' who predicted his crime. To tell any more of the story would disclose too much; besides, it isn't necessary. You know all you need to know here.The best parts of the movie are so good &#150; from the high-tech special effects to the light-hearted humorous moments to the good, steady flow of the action and plotline &#150; that the problems with the film are easily forgiven. That said, my main gripe is the presumption that, in the future, anyone convicted of a crime before it happens is immediately sent to a state of suspended animation, an alternative form of the death penalty. This is obviously one of the main sources of controversy within the storyline, but anyone can see that, in almost all cases, the predicted murders were not premeditated, if not potentially accidental, in which case, psychological counseling and some form of probation would be enough. There's nothing to suggest in the film that the context is a police state, which would allow the premise to make sense. Yet, so much of the movie is based on this premise, that may be bothersome to the discerning viewer. There are many such similar oversimplifications, each of which could be quite easily solved with a minor change or a quick dialog line or two, hence a mild sense of sloppiness in direction.Still, in the end, these didn't bother me that much.

This is obviously one of the main sources of controversy within the storyline, but anyone can see that, in almost all cases, the predicted murders were not premeditated, if not potentially accidental, in which case, psychological counseling and some form of probation would be enough. There's nothing to suggest in the film that the context is a police state, which would allow the premise to make sense. Yet, so much of the movie is based on this premise, that may be bothersome to the discerning viewer. There are many such similar oversimplifications, each of which could be quite easily solved with a minor change or a quick dialog line or two, hence a mild sense of sloppiness in direction.Still, in the end, these didn't bother me that much. I still had a great time, and enjoyed it as the frivolous and wonderfully playful action\/thriller it was intended to be.

I'm sure you've heard it enough. Lilo is a very spunky little girl who is VERY lifelike in her attitudes and actions, still coping with her parents death. There are times in the film when you just want to pick her up and hold her, but there are other times where you just question why a girl as smart as she is is not more aware of her situation.  All I've seen on her says she's 11, but my take is closer to 5-7.Every time I saw Nonni on the screen, I really wanted to cheer!  Finally an animated film with a realistic female body!  Her hips are actually wider than her bust and she is proportional!!!  Hallelujah, they are finally listening.  (I think Odette's waist in the Swan Princess was something like 1\/6 her bust).  And I loved not only her interaction with her sister in similarities, but their fights as well.Ving Rhames couldn't have been better as Cobra Bubbles.  There are just some voices that are meant to be certain characters and this is his.  (Think of the difference between John Goodman in The Emperor's New Groove as the peasant and Monster's as Sully).The supporting characters of Jumbaa, Grand Counsel woman and Plinkley are good but they left me flat.Stitch does an amazing transformation in his search for someplace to belong, and I cheered when he said he could be soft and fluffy, but again-I really didn't truly CARE.There is no real quintisential Disney villian in this piece and I think that is truly lacking, but with the villians they've had lately, that may be an improvement.I read a review that panned this film as too long and just not enough something.  They felt it would be a great cartoon series.  While I liked it well enough to see it at least one more time, I pray for the cartoon series. Now THAT is a vehicle with potential for this story.On my Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh LD, there is a featurette in which they said that because America was unfamiliar with Winnie the Pooh in the early 60's, Walt decided to split the story into 3 pieces to give us time to get used to and fall in love with Edward Bear.  It worked then and it is a shame that they weren't able to do something similar here.

You really got the sense of a soldier who was laden with huge self-doubt having to discipline himself to carry out his mission even though he clearly would rather do otherwise. I don't recall ever seeing Adam Beach before but he was fabulous in this film deserving of an Oscar nomination.

Why do British actors insist on trying to do an 'American' accent as a flat Midwestern drawl, which sounds only like the actor has a toothache? Olivier used to do this and Issacs did it here. If a British actor wants to do an 'American' accent why doesn't he just do a Southern accent which is very easy for an English person to do(Vivian Leigh in GWTW ring any bells?)? For the most part, the action scenes were excellent but Woo occasionally allowed the actors to do what I call 'Rambo-shooting.' Nobody in the military fires his weapon indiscriminately and watches the enemy collapse. Soldiers are required to do something known as 'aiming' the weapon. In the alternative, soldiers may aim at an area and fire rapidly into it. This is known as a 'field of fire.' The most recent film I've seen where this was done correctly was 'Once Were Soldiers.' Finally, the 'redneck' was unbelieveable even by Hollywood standards. Picture the scene. The Navajo soldier is considered important enough to have his own guard. The redneck starts a fight with the Navajo in a battle zone and in fact attempts to kill the Navajo and threatens to kill the Navajo later. The response of the sergeant in command is little more than one would expect of an elementary schoolteacher breaking up a fight at recess. In a war zone, the commanding sergeant might just put a bullet in the redneck's head. He's endangering the mission and the Code of Military Justice of almost every nation on the planet with a serious military does provide for 'drumhead' trials in such circumstances. Another option might have been something along the line of 'You touch him again and I'll kill you myself.' I won't even discuss how much I am annoyed by the use of a tiresome redneck stereotype.

They seem to be about a great many different things to me. And I hate to be picky but they're not so much conversations, in the sense of discussions, or witty talk, but just scenes, in which, needless to say, people do talk. The Sprecher sisters who together wrote and directed this movie are clever and original women.   It's a pity that their first effort turned out to be so disjointed and rambling.  It's even more unfortunate that it's a sententious and highfalutin downer that, despite the presence of excellent film actors, somehow isn't very cinematic &#150; I couldn't help feeling it would work much better and seem much wittier as a play.  Witty it is not. The Sprechers unfortunately interpret `conversations' to mean talk that touches on the meaning of life, and particularly on issues such as happiness, free will, and luck.  There is plot &#150; it's the car accidents, firings, divorces, abandonments,  minor natural disasters and personal cruelties that, despite the occasional hiring, good deed, or moment of enlightenment, make the whole thing such a gloomy way to spend an hour and forty-three minutes.  But despite these events, there is a great deal more telling than showing, and since the conversation is neither witty nor unified one can't help wishing there would be less of it &#150; Six Conversations About Four Things, say, and Seven Events Involving Twelve people.  What is it about such a system of organization that so much annoys me?  It's because it's so intrusive, so redolent of cutting and pasting and authorial intention. I don't like being told what all the scenes are about and it doesn't make it any better that they're really about something else. Did I say the actors were excellent? Somehow Alan Arkin dominates the movie.  I guess his Conversation is allowed to go on the longest.  Arkin as always is incisive; his very face is razor-like, somehow, even more so as he gets older  he sharpens, rather than mellows, with age.  He is absorbing, if rather grim, as a minor insurance claims executive who objects to a new colleague who's always happy.  Happiness is a snare and a delusion, he tells us, and he fires the colleague just to show he's right.  But &#150;paradox!-the colleague remains happy even when fired.  And then Arkin's character is so guilty he gets the colleague another job elsewhere, through pulling strings. Another colleague whom he brands as a loser ups and wins the lottery.  Bam!  These kinds of twists are much better when O.Henry puts them in a short story. Instead of a chapter heading there ought to be a sign saying  Message Coming.  John Turturro, who's good at being stiff, plays a prissy college physics teacher who (oh God!) believes that the Laws of Science are Absolute.  We're hardly surprised when he gets jilted by the woman he leaves his wife for, especially when we see him being nasty to an eager student with personal problems.

They seem to be about a great many different things to me. And I hate to be picky but they're not so much conversations, in the sense of discussions, or witty talk, but just scenes, in which, needless to say, people do talk. The Sprecher sisters who together wrote and directed this movie are clever and original women.   It's a pity that their first effort turned out to be so disjointed and rambling.  It's even more unfortunate that it's a sententious and highfalutin downer that, despite the presence of excellent film actors, somehow isn't very cinematic &#150; I couldn't help feeling it would work much better and seem much wittier as a play.  Witty it is not. The Sprechers unfortunately interpret `conversations' to mean talk that touches on the meaning of life, and particularly on issues such as happiness, free will, and luck.  There is plot &#150; it's the car accidents, firings, divorces, abandonments,  minor natural disasters and personal cruelties that, despite the occasional hiring, good deed, or moment of enlightenment, make the whole thing such a gloomy way to spend an hour and forty-three minutes.  But despite these events, there is a great deal more telling than showing, and since the conversation is neither witty nor unified one can't help wishing there would be less of it &#150; Six Conversations About Four Things, say, and Seven Events Involving Twelve people.  What is it about such a system of organization that so much annoys me?  It's because it's so intrusive, so redolent of cutting and pasting and authorial intention. I don't like being told what all the scenes are about and it doesn't make it any better that they're really about something else. Did I say the actors were excellent? Somehow Alan Arkin dominates the movie.  I guess his Conversation is allowed to go on the longest.  Arkin as always is incisive; his very face is razor-like, somehow, even more so as he gets older  he sharpens, rather than mellows, with age.  He is absorbing, if rather grim, as a minor insurance claims executive who objects to a new colleague who's always happy.  Happiness is a snare and a delusion, he tells us, and he fires the colleague just to show he's right.  But &#150;paradox!-the colleague remains happy even when fired.  And then Arkin's character is so guilty he gets the colleague another job elsewhere, through pulling strings. Another colleague whom he brands as a loser ups and wins the lottery.  Bam!  These kinds of twists are much better when O.Henry puts them in a short story. Instead of a chapter heading there ought to be a sign saying  Message Coming.  John Turturro, who's good at being stiff, plays a prissy college physics teacher who (oh God!) believes that the Laws of Science are Absolute.  We're hardly surprised when he gets jilted by the woman he leaves his wife for, especially when we see him being nasty to an eager student with personal problems.

People I am sure were thinking there would be no better movie than that one. Then one day I was told that Cruel Intentions was based on a movie called &#145; Dangerous Liaisons'. So I took it upon myself to get the tape and view this one. To my surprise I was delighted I did so, as Dangerous Liaisons is, if not as good as Cruel Intentions, even a little better, which for me is hard to admit.Valmont can't resist. Wealthy, alluring Merteuil has challenged him to seduce a beautiful and very proper young woman, a task involving Valmont's favourite pastimes love and revenge. What's more, Merteuil offers herself as the ultimate prize. So let the game begin. The unspoken rules to this contest of sinful pleasures are second-nature to rakish Valmont. Lie, cheat, deceive, debauch, double-cross, betray. But don't fall in love.The cast that Dangerous Liaisons has is just first class. The role Valmont is performed grandly by legend actor John Malkovich. I found the little things he does onscreen in this film to be just brilliant. Yet he showed how good an actor he really is. I mean this was a demanding role, with many facets to it, yet Malkovich did it as only he can. I enjoyed his character Valmont, as it really does show how selfish and cruel men can be. I am not sure that I would like all men to thought of like Valmont, but unfortunately some men are like him. Malkovich has been in some first-class movies like Being John Malkovich, The man in the Iron Mask, Con Air and I also like his performance in the TV version of the novel, &#145;Heart of Darkness'. Then you have the other main star of this film, that being the very beautiful Glenn Close, who played the nasty and &#145;bitchy', Merteuil. I enjoyed how her character was plotting the demise of a very innocent young daughter of a good friend. She wanted her to be known as a sluttish young woman, which is a terribly cruel scenario. Yet I can not forget to mention the other great members if this cast. I enjoyed the role of Madame de Tourvel, played by Michelle Pfeiffer. I have seen her in so many versatile roles, as a strong woman (e.g. like Catwoman), a romantic as in her role in Frankie and Johnny, then to see her rather frail character in this movie, I feel she was the perfect choice. Then you have a fine performance by a young, but talented Uma Thurman. Her character was extremely naïve, and I am sure that she made audiences believe she was a fooled, by the charms of Valmont. Again she is like Pfeiffer, in that she can take on a variety of roles that can have a differing range of emotions. Then to finish this cast of you have a minor role taken on by `Mr. Matrix', Keanu Reeves. He was by no means, that great in this role, but has withstood the test of time, to say he is now a pretty good actor.I enjoyed the work of the director of Dangerous Liaisons, that being Stephen Frears. I felt he put some good touches to this film. Apart from this film, Steve has done nothing that really stands out.  I also like how the time this movie was set in was brought to the screen. This is due mainly to Frear, and the wonderful cast that took part in this incredible film. Yet also like the story that was presented here, with some extraordinary characters. The screenplay for Dangerous Liaisons was written by Christopher Hampton, who did a wonderful job to bring a book and a play to the bigscreen. I felt he got it just right. There is no wonder that a movie like Cruel Intentions was adapted from this film. The story here is so powerful that I am sure many movies will try to replicate such a formula. Yet this story also makes me weary of how easy it is to be taken advantage of in real life. Some people don't care how they hurt people, or the consequences of their actions, as long as revenge has taken place. I hope movies like this show that revenge is not good for anyone, whether it be the person trying to hand it out, or the person receiving it. No one wins, and I know, as I have been in such a position. Then again, if you want to view a really fine piece of cinematography, then this film is the one for you most definitely.
