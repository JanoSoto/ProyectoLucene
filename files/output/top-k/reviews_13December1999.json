I happened to come across the present sequel in Blockbusters and, noting that it had a different actor in the title role and a different director (as well as an almost non-existent theatrical release), I checked it out with low expectations.  Well, I was surprised. The movie is much better than it has a right to be.  It copies the tone and content of the original pretty closely (including ultra-graphic gore), but at least it gets it right.  And Neil Giuntono gives a perfectly good performance as Henry (like Rooker, he effectively underplays the role).  The lower working class milieu that Henry finds himself a part of is as vividly captured as it is unsympathetic.

And that's including RoboCop 3.  I accept it's a low budget film, but that's no excuse for the leaden script, the bizarre pacing and direction, and basically wasting what little effort was put into it.  The guest stars were all good - indeed, Ron Pearlman was the most likeable character in the film, and I'm talking about his 'fascist politician' scenes, too.There is nothing to recommend about this movie - the characters are obnoxious and self-assured wannabe standup comedians.  My friends and I sat stoney faced as one liner after failed one liner dropped limply from the 'clever and witty script'.There were moments when character development threatened to appear, as some sort of depth was introduced to the 2D stars, only for it to vanish as if it had wandered in only by accident and didn't want to cause a fuss.In fact, the characterisation was possibly the reason I hated this film so much.  It seems the writers were too busy trying to show the friends enjoying each others' company so much that they forgot to include any reason why.  As best I could tell, it seemed they all got together for the conversation\/meal evenings purely so they could compete in witty banter and grin.And for some reason there was an odd are-they-aren't-they sexual tension between the dark haired woman and the black guy that went nowhere and did nothing other than take up valuable story time.  Which was probably the point - the entire film could have been condensed to a five minute short, and would have benefitted innumerably from the need to cut the chaff.The almost final scene, in the kitchen (I won't give any details away, for those who want to see it.) was almost farcical, as the mood violently swung in directions I didn't think possible.  The conclusion was obvious, inconclusive, unsatisfying and ultimately reflected the movie as a whole. I guess, in that sense, you could call it a success.To sum up, this bites.

It is also the movie that the others hint at becoming, a movie where the walls of repression have been stripped, and both the viewers and characters are left to watch the remnants of what remains.  Unlike Ordinary People and The Ice Storm, we see early and often the misery these people live with, and while Mary Tyler Moore remains ice cold throughout Ordinary People, Annette Benning and the rest of American Beauty have a complete meltdown before our very eyes. \tWhen the story opens, we learn of the tragedy that is about to unfold during the course of the movie, and we also see one of the most desperate characters in movie history, Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey).  On the surface, all looks well.  He has a good job, and a beautiful wife and daughter.  The problem is that he is despised by all three, and confides early on that he feels dead.  His wife (played by Annette Bening), a self absorbed real estate agent, is more willing than her husband to play the game of suburban respectability, but is clearly equally as miserable.  Benning plays this character so well that you completely forget how charming she was in The American President.  Their daughter (played by newcomer Thora Birch) plays typical teenage angst with such aplomb that it actually seems fresh and heartfelt on the screen. \tEach of the Burnhams enters into a relationship in the movie that helps each feel more alive.  Lester meets a teenage friend of his daughter, that ignites a passion in him that he thought has long since been dead.  Annette Bening's character meets her match in real estate king played by Peter Gallager, who is quite possibly even more self absorbed and greedy than her.  Finally, daughter Jane meets an enigmatic boy next door, who films her every move, sells pot to her father, and has a homophobic, straight laced military father (Chris Cooper).  The ironic thing is that he is the happiest, most stable character in the movie. \tWhile these three romances ignite passion in the Burnham clan, they each highlight the vapidity of their alleged family.  This leads to some shocking and surprisingly funny scenes where suburbia goes under attack, to the relish of both the characters and the audience.  All this while Lester begins his mid life crisis.  He starts working out at the suggestion of his love object (Lena Suvari, as the sister's friend), quits his job and black mails his pension, and starts buying pot from his daughter's new boyfriend.  While these actions are on the whole at the very least unwise, we see why Lester has made these choices, and we see his desperation turn to hope because of them. \tWe also see some very interesting cinematic decisions being made, particularly with the color red.  It is used to highlight roses, lips, doors, and blood, and eventually we see that the red comes to mean beauty and hope for the characters, even in the final scene, when tragedy takes place.   \tAnd the final scene.  Because we know the tragedy will happen later on, the question becomes how the tragedy takes place, and not will it.  The plot has a lot of fun teasing us with this information, and we are interested ourselves, until we reach that conclusion  It doesn't matter.  Who eventually causes the tragedy isn't important.

What is it about this man that gives him the ability to make movies that cause me to weep in the middle of a crowded theater?  Embarassing as it is, I wish he could find time in his schedule to do it more often that once every five years.This movie is beautifully photographed, improving on even Shawshank's look, although unfortunately the narrative strength of the movie is not as strong here (try as he might, Dabbs Greer is no Morgan Freeman)--and there wasn't any narration during the main story, something that really established the rhythm in The Shawshank Redemption.

Well the director of such atmospheric movies as Batman, Edward Scissorhands and Ed Wood has stepped into that realm with the visually stunning and violent Sleepy Hollow.  Burton has turned the old classic into a Burton classic as only his dark mind can and we as the audience benefit.Sleepy Hollow is based on the Washington Irving's Legend of Sleepy Hollow about school teacher Icabod Crane's encounter with the headless horseman, the ghost of a Hessian mercenary who terrorized the area known as Sleepy Hollow during the Revolutionary War.  Since we are in Burtonland, things have a certain twist.  Icabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is a constable in 1799 Manhattan who dabbles in forensic science, investigating deaths and inventing his interesting equipment to help him along the way.  Word travels to the city from a tiny farmland community up north about three mysterious deaths.  Iacbod looking for a challenge and a chance to utilize his skills, packs his bags and travels to the tiny village known as Sleepy Hollow.  Here the residents including the wealthy Baltus Van Tassel (Michael Gambon) and his daughter Katrina (Christina Ricci) tell him that these horrible deaths are the work of the headless horseman.  Iacabod, a sort of precursor to the X-Files Scully, governed by logic and science, believes that the work is not supernatural, but human. And so begins his investigation as more and more murders take place.Burton has created another wonderful imagined world that just takes you away for two hours.  It is a stunning film to look at, as are most of Burton's films.  His 18th century Manhattan and Sleepy Hollow are a world unto themselves and Burton draws you in immediately.  The action sequences with the headless horseman are astounding and truly haunting.  Each scene is so beautifully staged with great suspense.  Compare that with the dreadful and banal The Bone Collector that deals with the similar subject of a forensic expert investigating serial killings.  Reading The Legend of Sleepy Hollow as a child I always found it more humorous than terrifying, but Burton does a magnificent job of bringing out the darkness of the story which actually frightened me compared to so many trite horror films today.Burton's Icabod Crane is not your typical hero, but a flawed human being with weaknesses (he gets somewhat squeamish with blood, guts and spiders).  Johnny Depp creates another memorable character in a long line of quirky signature roles that have made him one of our finest risk-taking actors.  Depp fully embodies the character of Iacabod, warts and all.  He brings much depth, compassion and humor to the character.  It is a fully realized performance. The other performances are good, especially the very sexy Miranda Richardson.  The main weak link, unfortunately is the talented Christina Ricci.  It is not her fault; she is just very miscast in the role of the innocent Kristina.  She does not quite pull it off and comes off too modern for this period piece and it hurts the film to a certain degree.  Watching her performance, all I could think of was Winona Ryder; she would have been perfect.  Regardless of this flaw it is still a movie worth seeing and Sleepy Hollow shows that Tim Burton is one of our most gifted, imaginative and original directors that also shows his love for movies.  Casting the great Hammer horror actor Christopher Lee in a bit role shows that love as in the same way he cast the late Vincent Price in his classic Edward Scissorhands.  Sleepy Hollow is another gem from Burton.  If you are bringing children, which there were some in the theater, the decapitation scenes are gruesome and violent.

It's interesting to see the sensibility brought to the films by these directors.  I think it's really interesting to see the style of Jean Pierre Jeunet, director (with Marc Caro) of Delicatessen and City of Lost Children, both visual wonders and among the best films of the 90s (up against some stiff competition); applied to an Alien film.  I think it's interesting how  all the Alien films have different directors, and the series is kind of like that game children play where one writes the beginning of a story, and another writes the next part, and so on.  Of course, a lot of series fans don't like this, and were upset by the unfairly maligned Alien 3 after the slam-bang actioner Aliens.In a lesser director's hands, Alien Resurrection would probably be the worst of the Alien films to date.  The rather hackneyed script by Joss Whedon doesn't help anything.  What saves the film is the remarkable visual style of Jean Pierre-Jeunet, along with the photography of Darius Khondji, one of the best cinematographers working today.  Some of the action scenes are good too, like the long underwater sequence (I think underwater scenes are a Jeunet and Caro trademark).  John Frizell's score is serviceable, but far from the eerie Jerry Goldsmith score for the original film by Ridley Scott.  I would've liked it if Angelo Badalamenti had been retained from City of Lost Children.I think the film has a very French, avant-garde style to it, much like HR Giger's designs (Giger is Swiss, I know); and has has a similar Gothic feeling to David Fincher's Alien 3.  The script and some of the performances (like those of Dan Hedaya and Brad Dourif not that I don't like them) lend the film a slight tone of camp, which feels a little incongrous with Jeunet's direction.  Sigourney Weaver is good as usual, and I enjoyed seeing Dominique Pinion, from Delicatessen and City of Lost Children (his line who were you expecting, Santa Claus? is from City, although it was Miette who said it, not him); I probably would've cast someone other than Winona Ryder in the role of Call, though. Even though this is the first Alien film with a European director, the series has had a European connection from the first film, with Giger's designs, and much of the first half of the film being inspired by Mario Bava's Planet of the Vampires.  I think if Dario Argento directed an Alien film (that would go against the pattern of the Alien films being helmed by fairly new directors), it might be a little like this one.Another complaint I have is that the screenwriter doesn't really explore the possibilities of the technology that must have developed during the 200 years between Alien 3 and this film.  I know it makes for an interesting horror film concept, but why did they have to kidnap people in hypersleep to infect with the aliens?  You'd think they'd be able to clone humans by then or do something else.I think Jeunet was a really interesting choice of director for this film. I nominate the Wachowski brothers to direct Alien 5 (with Bill Pope as DP, of course).  This film certainly isn't as good as Ridley Scott's classic Alien, but still a worthwhile entry into the series.

I would've liked it if Angelo Badalamenti had been retained from City of Lost Children.I think the film has a very French, avant-garde style to it, much like HR Giger's designs (Giger is Swiss, I know); and has has a similar Gothic feeling to David Fincher's Alien 3.  The script and some of the performances (like those of Dan Hedaya and Brad Dourif not that I don't like them) lend the film a slight tone of camp, which feels a little incongrous with Jeunet's direction.  Sigourney Weaver is good as usual, and I enjoyed seeing Dominique Pinion, from Delicatessen and City of Lost Children (his line who were you expecting, Santa Claus? is from City, although it was Miette who said it, not him); I probably would've cast someone other than Winona Ryder in the role of Call, though. Even though this is the first Alien film with a European director, the series has had a European connection from the first film, with Giger's designs, and much of the first half of the film being inspired by Mario Bava's Planet of the Vampires.  I think if Dario Argento directed an Alien film (that would go against the pattern of the Alien films being helmed by fairly new directors), it might be a little like this one.Another complaint I have is that the screenwriter doesn't really explore the possibilities of the technology that must have developed during the 200 years between Alien 3 and this film.  I know it makes for an interesting horror film concept, but why did they have to kidnap people in hypersleep to infect with the aliens?  You'd think they'd be able to clone humans by then or do something else.I think Jeunet was a really interesting choice of director for this film. I nominate the Wachowski brothers to direct Alien 5 (with Bill Pope as DP, of course).  This film certainly isn't as good as Ridley Scott's classic Alien, but still a worthwhile entry into the series.

It's interesting to see the sensibility brought to the films by these directors.  I think it's really interesting to see the style of Jean Pierre Jeunet, director (with Marc Caro) of Delicatessen and City of Lost Children, both visual wonders and among the best films of the 90s (up against some stiff competition); applied to an Alien film.  I think it's interesting how  all the Alien films have different directors, and the series is kind of like that game children play where one writes the beginning of a story, and another writes the next part, and so on.  Of course, a lot of series fans don't like this, and were upset by the unfairly maligned Alien 3 after the slam-bang actioner Aliens.In a lesser director's hands, Alien Resurrection would probably be the worst of the Alien films to date.  The rather hackneyed script by Joss Whedon doesn't help anything.  What saves the film is the remarkable visual style of Jean Pierre-Jeunet, along with the photography of Darius Khondji, one of the best cinematographers working today.

Since the release of the excellent Pulp Fiction in 1994, we've been virtually bombarded with Fiction knock-offs such as 2 Days in the Valley and Things to Do in Denver When Your Dead.  Catchy titles, but ultimately boring films which ooze with Hey!  Look at me!  I'm just like Pulp Fiction!  These films make a self conscious attempt to be hip and cool, but fall flat.  These films biggest fault however, and it took Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels for me to realize this, is that they take themselves way too seriously.  The dark humor, so essential to this type of story line, was absent.Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels brings the humor back.  Guy Ritchie never seemed to take his script too seriously and gave us some real gems of screen moments.  There is nothing like a gang of heavily armed, very menacing thugs attempting to rip-off a group of relatively pacifistic pot growers\/dealers and they can't even get into the building because a heavy steel locked cage surrounds the inside of the entryway!  To make matters worse, they become trapped in the cage and are irritatingly shot at from a hidden ajoining cubby hole with the only weapon the pot growers possess-a pellet gun!Guy Ritchie directed Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels with real style and verve.  Ritchie uses the camera to great effect, building moments of stress and tension and literally using the visual to place us inside the emotions of the characters.  I won't give away the outcome of an early poker game which starts the later bizarre chain of events played between Eddy (Nick Moran), one of the four principle characters, and Hatchet Harry Lonsdale (P.H. Moriarty), the local crime boss, but pay particular attention to the way the camera is used to demonstrate Eddy's emotions when the game is over.All the actors give great performances.  It's impossible to pick one (and this film has quite a few characters) who stood out from the rest.  And seeing Sting play Eddy's father was a real treat.Great multi-layered characters.
