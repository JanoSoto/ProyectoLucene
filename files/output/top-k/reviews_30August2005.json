'Stalag 17', 'double indemnity', 'the apartment' all are such great movies. Most of the movie is narrated in first person and you see what the protagonist sees, a technique which has been used in so many movies after this. The narration is flawless and drama so intense that I watched the whole movie without batting an eyelid. The characters are real with shades of grey that you empathize and dislike at the same time. The whole thing is dark and a film noir in true sense. One of my all time favorites and I cannot over-recommend this movie to anyone.

I was too young to remember them(was 4 when they ended), and listening to the music, looking at the hairstyles and watching the movies... it's just not the same. This particular brand of 80's comedy hits a particularly bad note with me; the fish-out-of-the-water, combined with ridiculous sci-fi and with many of the jokes heavily, pitifully overdone. As such, this movie is hard for me to objectively review... so you will have to forgive me if this turns a tad too cruel. Having seen this at least once before, a few years ago, I mainly watched this to see the popular teen actors at a younger age... Lewis, Hannigan and Green. It was quite amusing to see them so young, and I don't regret investing a hundred minutes of half-attentive time on it... again. The film itself is OK... the plot is about as far out as they go, but I guess it's somewhat original and surely an interesting idea. The pacing seems mostly off, and you're often pondering when a scene will move on. This may be that I'm used to newer, more fast-paced movies... but I have few(if any) problems with Hitchcock's films, even his oldest... so I suspect that it's the direction rather than my attention span. The humor is mostly poor, or at least overdone. The gags are maybe funny at first, but when you get down to it, it's basically one joke told over and over, and it's just not that funny or original. The acting seems somewhat shoddy, as well. The characters are mostly one-note jokes, walking clichés, stereotypes, whichever expression you prefer. All in all, this is a fair comedy, considering the time it was made, but it's not really worth watching unless you're a big fan of some of the actors. I recommend this only to very big fans of several of the people involved in making it. 5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"30 August 2005","score":"5 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":" I'm not much for the 80's.

Sam Raimi's Evil Dead II makes fun of the Devil and demon possession. Although there are some really scary scenes, there are some really twisted funny situations that would leave you wondering what the f*** just happened?!. The movie is funny for the wrong reasons. I eventually don't laugh about when a man is breaking himself dishes on the head. I don't think it's funny when a man is repeatedly beaten up by grotesque characters. I would never imagine a man getting eaten by a demon locked under a cellar and throwing gallons of blood! Evil Dead II makes it look hilarious in a wicked kind of way. For example, when Linda's head tells Ash that she is being tormented, and suffering in hell; you can feel a little scared but the next scene has a corpse without a head holding a chainsaw. There's no time for logic here, just sit and enjoy!It also has the ability to make you feel tense and I must say, scared. The combination of demon possessed people, EVIL sounds (I love the weird noise in the movie), wicked laughs and chanting (dead by dawn!), and intrepid camera angles are the perfect ingredients to make a sui generis Horror-Comedy movie. Watch out for the A Farewell to Arms joke, the whole situation with the evil hand, and the eye that gets in a woman's mouth!.Sam Raimi went too far for the good reasons. He created an unbelievable and unforgettable work that has served as inspiration for many movies in recent years. The movie is easily one of the most visually stunning Horror movies of all time, for sure. Die hard fans of gore get an eye candy for an hour and a half. Raimi created a cult movie in all the sense of the world. Groovy!. Dead by Dawn will never bore you because in every scene there's a feeling of uncertainty and that makes it even more interesting. There are no rules here. The plot is as scary as you can imagine but it's held in such a way that it isn't taken very seriously. I mean, demon possession caused by the Necronomicon is something that happens in the real world. Not exactly with that book but it can happen via satanic books and rituals. Raimi takes it to a different level of humor mixed with gore. Bruce Campbell deserves a special mention. He delivers a wicked, solid, and totally believable performance. Something you haven't seen before mainly because of the strange situations he goes through. His performance could be described as a solo. Easily, one of the best performances of any actor in a Horror movie. Also, one of the characters that suffers the most in any movie! Ash is beaten up by demons, humans, objects, etc. Even possessed creatures make fun of him. The gore here is great, glorious. You get decaps, mutilated bodies, a hand cut off, bleeding demons, etc. Blood spread all over the cabin is the common denominator. One of the goriest movies of all time. Watch Evil Dead II to witness one of the most creative, brave, and goriest movies of all time. It delivers something for everyone. It has action, gore, spectacular camera angles, and some action! Check out Ash V.S. possessed Henrietta. * After it, phrases like join us!, swallow this!, and specially groovy! will be part of your daily vocabulary. Recommended for every Horror fan in the world.

There are only a few missing like Rob Lowe and Demi Moore from St. Elmo's Fire. It is nothing like any of the undergraduate slob films like Porky's and the MeatBalls series. This flick tries to take teen angst seriously and it examines the various types you will find in high school, like the jock, the nerd, etc.Judd Nelson gives the performance he would be called upon to do again and again, the angry loner who has a terrible home life and who always seems to know everything much better than you. Not that his acting isn't good here but you get weary of seeing him shout and be provocative to everybody in the course of almost 2 hours. He would retread his character here in Blue City and Fandango and finally he couldn't get any choice films to his credit. The other Brat Packers do not have as flashy a presence as Nelson and you can see why they had trouble finding work after the craze was over.As for the film itself it is rather original. To set almost the entire movie in a class room was a bit of a gamble, especially since such high voltage action films like Beverly Hills Cop and Top Gun would dominate the box office for most of the middle to late 80's. There has to be some pretty impressive dialog to hold the audience's interest and nobody could write it like John Hughes. The fact that the F-word is spoken frequently was probably shocking to a lot of adults at the time and that is probably why it has an R rating.Be warned, though, that this is not a comedy and anyone who is expecting it will be sorely disappointed. John Hughes has also written great comedies like Planes, Trains and Automobiles but the mood of this picture can be interpreted as terribly depressing. There are some scattered laughs but it is only because the adult characters, especially the principal is such buffoons that you laugh derisively at them. All in all I will say that even though the pace is enormously slow the viewing of this film should not be missed because after all the Brat Pack was talented and they were fun to watch.

He would retread his character here in Blue City and Fandango and finally he couldn't get any choice films to his credit. The other Brat Packers do not have as flashy a presence as Nelson and you can see why they had trouble finding work after the craze was over.As for the film itself it is rather original. To set almost the entire movie in a class room was a bit of a gamble, especially since such high voltage action films like Beverly Hills Cop and Top Gun would dominate the box office for most of the middle to late 80's. There has to be some pretty impressive dialog to hold the audience's interest and nobody could write it like John Hughes. The fact that the F-word is spoken frequently was probably shocking to a lot of adults at the time and that is probably why it has an R rating.Be warned, though, that this is not a comedy and anyone who is expecting it will be sorely disappointed. John Hughes has also written great comedies like Planes, Trains and Automobiles but the mood of this picture can be interpreted as terribly depressing. There are some scattered laughs but it is only because the adult characters, especially the principal is such buffoons that you laugh derisively at them. All in all I will say that even though the pace is enormously slow the viewing of this film should not be missed because after all the Brat Pack was talented and they were fun to watch.

There are only a few missing like Rob Lowe and Demi Moore from St. Elmo's Fire. It is nothing like any of the undergraduate slob films like Porky's and the MeatBalls series.

The new girl Valerie Bates (Robin Stille) is invited, but she overhears Trish's friends Diane (Gina Mari) and Jackie (Andree Honore) voice their disinterest in her attending. Trish tries to get her to come and be accepted, but she blows it off and Kimberly Clarke (Debra Deliso) says she can attend instead. Later that night, the girls arrive, but they don't know Valerie is next door and can see the party. Valerie and her younger sister Courtney (Jennifer Meyers) watch the four girls as they all have fun. After a few weird occurrences around the house are revealed to be the work of two practical jokers, the four girls are eased of tension. While Courtney is trying to convince Val that she should crash the party, a serial killer is on the loose and begins stalking them. Trapped inside the house with no way out, they try to survive the night.The Good News This is one of the best slashers ever made. It has everything that slasher fans need in a good movie great kills, a unique setting, a menacing killer, cheesy lines, a bevy of beautiful woman taking their clothes off, and great atmosphere. It features the entire movie talking place, for the most part, inside a woman's house, with the kills taking place around the house. There are quite a few good kills a man gets his eyes drilled out, another is stabbed in the stomach with a power drill, one has a slashed neck, and another is decapitated. There is more, but most of it is off-screen, so the die-hards can only see the after-effects of the kill. More often than not, a person will stumble upon a dead body, and that provides the majority of the film's scares. I also have to mention that the great Brinke Stevens is in this, and her role is the absolute best example of suspense. She mentions to friends that she has to retrieve a book she left in her gym locker, and upon trying to leave the building, she finds all the doors have been locked. As she tries to open the main door out, she comes across the killer, who waves his drill in her face, scaring her and forcing her to run. The resulting very long chase through the girls' gym is the best stalk scene this side of Crystal Lake. It is believable as well, since what happens could actually happen to a person if they were chased by a maniac in a building where they knew the location and the maniac didn't. It is my favorite scene, aside from the ample nudity. I really should mention it first in the bottom line of the review, but I think I left it in the right spot. What's also great is that the killer is a master at two things most killers never do he's great at silently stalking a victim, and he's great at picking off the person you wouldn't expect at that time. The deaths are seen coming a mile away, but he then switches his aim and picks someone else off that wasn't who the audience thought was the target of the attack. That was a great twist. Also, there is one scene that I simply have to mention here, as it is a personal favorite, and I know many of my friends really hate this scene, but I love it Trish and another girl are upstairs in her room, and they escape the killer and move a large cabinet in front of the door, preventing him from entering. After waiting for several moments with no apparent evidence that he's there, they let down their guard. We then switch to her window on the other side of the room, and we see him entering through the window, with the girls completely oblivious to his presence. He gets right up on them before he creaks the floor, alerting them to the fact that he's literally breathing on their necks, forcing them to run. I love it, but because the killer can be seen stalking the woman when every single person in the world would've noticed it, my friends hate the scene. I think it's a genius scene.The Bad News First of all, it's far too short. It barely lasts over an hour, and with the end credits it reaches an hour and fifteen minutes. I think it could've been expanded a little more, with maybe more emphasis on what they are doing at the slumber party. They are there for what seems like a long time, but nothing happens and most of it is split between the party and Val and her sister arguing whether Val should go or not. They needed to bump that up some more, and maybe get some gore in the film. It is bloody, and I like it, but maybe some more flowing red stuff would make it a scarier film.The Final Verdict With a bit more running time, this could be one of the best slashers to come from this time period. As it stands, this is still something most single red-blooded males will want to see, with the blood and nudity, and all 80's slasher fans will definitely like this one.

It is, however, the ultimate embodiment of John Woo's style of film-making. What more could you ask for in a cop story? Officers face off with criminals in massive gunfights, fellow cops are killed on the jobs, undercover cops tread through dangerous waters, with double-crossing abound, and a final, bloody climax with bullets and bodies flying. Not only that, but strong performances from the lead actors that give us the kind of characters we want.The main appeal of this movie is its front man, the legendary Chow Yun-Fat. He's in top form in this movie. You can't help but love it when he's got two guns in his hands, and he's jumping all over the place while blowing away goons. He's the master when it comes to this. And, not only is he in top action form, but he also finds time to throw in a joke or two, giving us the Martin Riggs-of-Lethal Weapon character feel, if only for a few scenes. His character is a musician on the side, with everyday problems of his own, like staying in a bar while trying to find a place to live, and struggling with his current love life. He looks like a normal guy off the job. But on the job, he's Supercop. Whether he's sliding down the rail of a stairwell while blazing two pistols, blowing away baddies with a 12-guage as they fly in on motorcycles, or standing face-to-face with his adversary in the traditional Mexican standoff, he's a joy to watch for the action fan.The other actors give decent performances at least. Tony Leung, however, gives a performance equal to, if not better than, that of Yun-Fat. Being in his character's position takes enormous tolls on ones' personality. He's great as the undercover cop trying to get his man. Also, it's very appealing to see the star of In the Mood for Love, which won him a Best Actor award at Cannes, leap through the air with two guns blazing. This is by far one of Leung's more enjoyable films.The film, as I said earlier, is not flawless. Some elements of the story were not played out right. The script is average at best, and some parts of it happened to fast without things being fully played out (to go into more detail would make this a spoiler). But all that aside, there's nothing wrong with this movie. Some people have made the enormous mistake of believing that Woo portrays a lack of respect for human life, since innocent civilians are gunned down in an action-style fashion. They obviously haven't heard Woo's commentary on the DVD, or know much about how he thinks. Why do you think every single on-screen death is filmed in slow-motion? Because every man is given a hero's death! When innocent people are killed in the film, it is portrayed utter contempt for human life by the criminals. This film was made as an enormous tribute to the Hong Kong police, who have dealt with similar situations as in this film many times. Hong Kong was, for a long time, the crime capital of the world. After living there for fifty-plus years, Woo knows what he's doing. For instance, when you watch the film, you may ask yourself, Why did those criminals just kill all those innocent people? That's exactly what Woo is asking.Overall, we get a great action film. Not in the ranks of masterpieces like Die Hard, Aliens, The Matrix, or even Woo's The Killer.

It is, however, the ultimate embodiment of John Woo's style of film-making. What more could you ask for in a cop story? Officers face off with criminals in massive gunfights, fellow cops are killed on the jobs, undercover cops tread through dangerous waters, with double-crossing abound, and a final, bloody climax with bullets and bodies flying. Not only that, but strong performances from the lead actors that give us the kind of characters we want.The main appeal of this movie is its front man, the legendary Chow Yun-Fat. He's in top form in this movie. You can't help but love it when he's got two guns in his hands, and he's jumping all over the place while blowing away goons. He's the master when it comes to this. And, not only is he in top action form, but he also finds time to throw in a joke or two, giving us the Martin Riggs-of-Lethal Weapon character feel, if only for a few scenes. His character is a musician on the side, with everyday problems of his own, like staying in a bar while trying to find a place to live, and struggling with his current love life. He looks like a normal guy off the job. But on the job, he's Supercop. Whether he's sliding down the rail of a stairwell while blazing two pistols, blowing away baddies with a 12-guage as they fly in on motorcycles, or standing face-to-face with his adversary in the traditional Mexican standoff, he's a joy to watch for the action fan.The other actors give decent performances at least. Tony Leung, however, gives a performance equal to, if not better than, that of Yun-Fat. Being in his character's position takes enormous tolls on ones' personality. He's great as the undercover cop trying to get his man. Also, it's very appealing to see the star of In the Mood for Love, which won him a Best Actor award at Cannes, leap through the air with two guns blazing. This is by far one of Leung's more enjoyable films.The film, as I said earlier, is not flawless. Some elements of the story were not played out right. The script is average at best, and some parts of it happened to fast without things being fully played out (to go into more detail would make this a spoiler). But all that aside, there's nothing wrong with this movie. Some people have made the enormous mistake of believing that Woo portrays a lack of respect for human life, since innocent civilians are gunned down in an action-style fashion. They obviously haven't heard Woo's commentary on the DVD, or know much about how he thinks. Why do you think every single on-screen death is filmed in slow-motion? Because every man is given a hero's death! When innocent people are killed in the film, it is portrayed utter contempt for human life by the criminals. This film was made as an enormous tribute to the Hong Kong police, who have dealt with similar situations as in this film many times. Hong Kong was, for a long time, the crime capital of the world. After living there for fifty-plus years, Woo knows what he's doing. For instance, when you watch the film, you may ask yourself, Why did those criminals just kill all those innocent people? That's exactly what Woo is asking.Overall, we get a great action film. Not in the ranks of masterpieces like Die Hard, Aliens, The Matrix, or even Woo's The Killer.

But Raising Arizona is my personal favorite, and probably the most quotable films I have ever seen, with some of the best dialogue ever written for film. The story in brief H.I. (Nicholas Cage) and Ed (Holly Hunter, in one of my favorite roles of hers) portray, respectively, an ex-con and a cop who meet when he keeps getting arrested for robbing convenience stores. They fall in love, get married, decide that there is just too much love between them, and they need a critter to share it with. Upon finding that Edwina's insides were a rocky place where H.I.'s seed could find no purchase, they try to adopt, but are turned down because of H.I.'s record. Then they read in the newspaper about local unpainted furniture storeowner Nathan Arizona (Trey Wilson), owner of Unpainted Arizona, and his wife having quintuplets as a result of fertility pills, and who joke that They got more than they can handle. The couple hatch a plan to take one of the babies and raise it as their own. What results is an ongoing, fast-paced, hilarious set of misadventures, complicated by the appearance of a ruthless, heartless outlaw named Leonard Smalls (Randall Tex Cobb) Nathan Arizona hires to find the missing baby, and two felon friends from H.I.'s past (John Goodman and William Forsythe), who make a childbirth-like escape from prison. Sam McMurray (the smarmy dad in Drop Dead Gorgeous) is H.I.'s....smarmy boss, Glen. Frances McDormand (real-life spouse of Joel Coen, and star of other Coen films such as Blood Simple and Fargo) is his excitable wife Dot. M. Emmet Walsh (Blood Simple) has a scenery-chewing cameo role as H.I.'s talkative co-worker.When Ed finally opens up her 5'2 can of Southern-fried whup-ass, throwing her badge to the dirt, striding towards Leonard Smalls as she bellows with all her might, Gimme back that baby, you warthog from HELL!!! I always fling my arms up and shout You go girl! Kick his ass! And the way Hunter cries is hilarious.Holly Hunter was great in this role, as one would expect. She's a very talented actress, in both serious and comedic roles.Nicholas Cage and Holly Hunter made a great on screen couple, Cage with his hair standing out in every direction, looking like a hapless, browbeaten puppy half of the time, and Hunter as his diminutive firecracker of a wife who loves him and tries to keep him honest (oh yeah except for that little kidnapping excursion). I could go on and on about this film but suffice to say that so far I haven't met anyone who didn't find Raising Arizona hilarious. And as any great Coen brothers film, it has a certain mythic quality that's hard to describe, but is present all of of the brothers' best efforts. When I was single, I often used Coen brothers films as a barometer of sorts for prospective boyfriends. For instance, I remember seeing Fargo on a first date, and when we came out of the theater, the guy (whose name I have since forgotten anyway) remarked Huh, I didn't think much of that, while I was thinking how blown away I was by the film!

There are several of my favourite actors in this film, especially a very diverse villain played by Gary Oldman, an absolutely stunning heroine who in my view, started the revolution of the female hero, rather than the 'damsel in distress' that we have seen for many years, played by Milla Jovovich. and a really anti-hero like hero played by Bruce Willis. Luc Besson has directed several of my favourite films, and seeing an interview that he had during the release of the film, it seems that he had been working on the main storyline as a child. I'm glad to see that somebody could come up with one of their own ideas for a film in Hollywood, rather than releasing a very poor re-vamp of an old classic, as we have come to see nowadays. I love the effects that were used in the film, regardless of whether people say they are dated, and there is one of the best movie-score soundtracks to this film.

I'm glad to see that somebody could come up with one of their own ideas for a film in Hollywood, rather than releasing a very poor re-vamp of an old classic, as we have come to see nowadays. I love the effects that were used in the film, regardless of whether people say they are dated, and there is one of the best movie-score soundtracks to this film. In my opinion, an underrated classic. Watch this film!

I had heard of the film and wanted to watch it at the cinema, but being 12, I was always poor, but fortunately, my friend had borrowed it from an uncle, and both being sci-fi geeks, decided to watch it.. I was absolutely blown away by the overall presentation of the film, and fell in love with it immediately. It focuses on the stereotypical sci-fi action thriller, where an evil from outer space is set to destroy the universe, and the hero(s) have to stop it. There is definitely a cult status around this film, and it still doesn't get boring for me.

It was my 3rd attempt. I will try to explain how the movie works for me. I think the first part of the movie is Diane Selwyn's dream (and some wishful thinking) Diane Selwyn played by Naomi Watts. Before the credits you can notice somebody facing his red cushion and sinking down. She (?) falls into sleep. Before Club Silencio, all the things going on seem to be a wonderful dream for her. Her goddess had an accident just as she was threatened by two cruel guys. Thus Rita (a dreamed character of Diane's female affair Camilla Rhodes - played by Laura Harring) suffers a total loss of memory. The following story shows the wonderful life of Betty - Diane's alter ego. All you can see is remix of Diane's memory. The unusual story of lovely Betty and amnesiac Rita heightens straight up to its climax in the end of part 1. There is no aftershow in Club Silencio. Diane is waking up confronted with her present life... She is suffering the probable death of Camilla Rhodes - the woman she loves. Diane payed for the assassin. In the second part of the the movie you can notice details of Diane's life which are reflected in her dream. The plot jumps before and after her wakening up.Incidentally, while Betty and Rita are visiting Diane Selwyn in no.17, Diane dreams visiting her own burial together with a person who should regret.

And then you realized something like 'ha ha, it's for like makeup or whatever' )Sound Editing, I believe). But that's kind of my gut reaction to this movie - basically a good ride (I remember seeing it a couple times in the cinema), but, wow, not anything that should ever be referenced as 'good'.Scenery-chewing (in a good way) by John Malkovich, Ving Rhames and Steve Buscemi give this movie what entertainment value it has. All three ham up their performances with the director's (and the audience's) blessing, and clearly had a lot of fun doing this. I can't blame them, as it probably was.Nicholas Cage competes strongly with Dick Van Dyke in the 'Worst On-Screen Accent of All Time' category, with an Alabama drawl that makes me feel like someone's working my cerebellum with a cheese-grater.John Cusack is slapped in the background, even during scenes in which he's talking. His entire performance is straight-to-cable, and is possibly the biggest downer - we all know he (unlike Cage) could be doing a lot better.The first ten minutes of the movie are swallowed by a gaping plot-hole, in order to get Nick Cage ('a really good guy, with some lethal training') aboard Con Air, surrounded by all the evil in the universe. Clearly not comfortable with making him an anti-hero (which would have been infinitely preferable), we're instead stuck watching a pre-credit buildup that stretches one's benign disbelief to the breaking point.On the positive side, it gets a bonus point for having rocket launchers. I'm easy.6\/10. I'd buy the DVD on eBay, but not pause it while I'm cooking dinner.
