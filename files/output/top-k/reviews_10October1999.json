In Cookie's Fortune he describes one of the funniest murder inquiries I have ever seen. This is not slap-stick comedy. It made me laugh even more deep inside because of the discretion with which the humor is delivered. There is also a lot of love in this movie. I like the long time friends coming to the rescue theme and the multileveled message. It touches religion, racism, friendship and destiny. Very positive and enjoyable movie.

Friends & Lovers fits the last category like a wedding dress.  It is one of the most jaw-droppingly bad movies I have ever seen.  This film has, virtually, no redeeming qualities.  The acting is wooden and unrealistic, notably by Claudia Schiffer and, surprisingly, Robert Downey Jr.  One person I did like and care for was Danny Nucci's character, but he couldn't have save this film if his life depended on it.  The characters carry on, endlessly, in boring, silly and uninvolving conversations.  This cast could have had a lot of potential had they had a script that wasn't found in a garbage dump.  I was never really fond of Stephen Baldwin, the only role I accepted him in was The Usual Suspects.  There was a moment in the film where is a graphic close-up shot of a man's genitals that is, not only gratuitous, but it ruined what could have been a semi-chuckle on my part.  I don't know.  All was lost on this film.  Friends & Lovers ranks in the same field as 1997's worst film, Gone Fishin'.

But in a lot of ways this third installment was just not necessary.  If it was all about revealing Michael's wounded mind, and ensuring that he was 'punished for his sins', that was done (quite well, and in a much less graphic way) in Part II You could tell he was undone in the very last scene.  Part III was just overkill.There were a few casting problems, as well.  Sofia Coppola was just terrible, absolutely painful to watch.  George Hamilton made the film look like a made-for-TV movie every time he appeared What was he doing there?? I sure did miss Robert Duvall!  The saving graces were Talia Shire as Connie getting her chance to dominate.  Andy Garcia, though he didn't have the opportunity to really take off, was a lot of fun to watch.
