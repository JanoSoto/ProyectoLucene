It was a very risky sci-fi movie for the time. There are no spaceships zipping around shoot death star shaped objects. There is no improbable hero. There are no three eyed aliens. Even so Contact was fascinating. That was back in 97.I just watched the movie now in 2012 an oh how nostalgia sometimes is ripped apart by a second viewing. Once again i was fascinated, by the first 30 Min's, which is gripping. Things go really downhill after that where smart science is thrown out the window for things like time travel. Its a very strange mix to suddenly shift from plausible to blatent impossibility.Then it struck me how much of a complete cop out the whole movie is on many levels. The audience goes through many levels of expectation only to be left down by a really bad punchline in the plot. The film starts by being grounded and interesting. The whole sequence of events when the first signal is received is just as exciting for us as it is for the scientists on the screen. You can feel the wonder of what being in that situation would be like. Then things start to take a surreal turn. The intelligent science is now technobabble. Its very hard to be riveted by discussions about waves within waves and when Hitler is suddenly thrust into things you start to feel you are being preached to. The preaching thus continues throughout the whole movie to one degree or another. Not thought provoking stuff, this is Hollywood preaching where everything is explained to you. But the biggest cop out of all is the beach scene. As a viewer you have just been through the ordeal of Jodie Foster being thrust through wormholes. After an experience like that you almost deserve a good pay off. You go through all that, the whole movie, waiting for the point when you will see the extraterrestrial life. Oh dear. Its a beach with Jodies dad. I understand the point behind the scene, i understand that it worked out in the book, but here it feels out of place.Contact really does not know what it wants to be, it tries to be many things but ends up getting bogged down by the very simplified notion of science and religion working together. It overshadows the whole point of the first contact event. I never connect religion with science. Science is truth. Religion is faith. But in the case of Contact religion simply bullies and seduces science. Science is left to cow tow to religion asking for its acceptance. This happens when doubt is raised. The Hollywood preaching machine is simply telling you heck if it can't be explained just have faith. Thats the deep message you are left with. Its not even written in a way where the viewer can have any doubts. Everything is said time and time again until you get it. After Ms fosters very long speech about having faith ( in case you missed it already ) there is a scene which negates everything just said by proving you didn't need faith really anyway cause its all real. The ultimate cop out. The revelation itself is the dumbest thing ever. Nobody whatever thought about putting a clock on the pod ? Nobody noticed really quickly that 18 hours of static was recorded ? Did they just watch it for 3 Min's ? Its just too dumb to comprehend especially when Ms Foster character is basically called a liar. you're a liar oh no you're not. It's that black and white.If Contact had been smart about its preaching it would have been a much more enjoyable. Instead the religious stuff is just eye rolling bad which makes it a chore to sit through. Its a shame really, the idea behind it all is fine, it just fails to deliver on what it promises.

We see a deep dark honest look at the yang side of the Star Trek future. We see a space ship that is impressive looking to the audience but we can tell from how beat up it looks on the outside, even the title of the spaceships words are faded; so it's obviously seen better days. Even the inside of the ship isn't any better looking, from bad lighting, constant mechanical problems like in one scene landing gear breaks like a toothpick when they land on a planet; some computers are out of order and might be dated looking. It sort of reflects the characters state of mind. But that lighting also almost give the film sort of a Gothic sensibility.The other thing that works are the characters they all look and act like everyday people. None of them are really handsome or beautiful looking (well except of Sigonrey Weaver as Ripley). Let alone all of them are adults and I like that as opposed to the pretty boy girl look which I can't stand or everyone being teens which is getting really old.

But their all well rounded you actually care about them and hope that at least one of them will make it.This helps give us the sense of reality of this world of tomorrow and what it has come to.

Just like the design and behavior of the creature which seems to be a bizarre blend of a lot of things with the animalistic destructive qualities which make it all the more terrifying. We only get flashes and glimpses of the monster to make the presence of evil hidden and a powerful force to be reckoned with. The fact the ship has poor lighting, claustrophobic and isolated setting doesn't help much which gives the alien more advantage.

Read this review AFTER you've seen it. Seen it & love it? This review is not for you (sorry-read if you want but just know you're the choir & I'm the preacher). Think VERTIGO is maybe the most overrated movie ever? READ ON because THAT'S who this review is for! Because like you, I once thought the same thing. First let's talk about the plot holes. Like How did Scotty get off that roof anyhow? Did they inflate a giant airbag on the street that he fell onto? Maybe a S.W.A.T. team climbed on the roof & somehow managed to tie a rope around his waist. I know SPIDERMAN rescued him. Second Why would Elster let an accomplice to the murder (Judy) remain behind (in the same town with the witness no less) when she could so easily expose them both? Seems a loose end Elster would not allow considering how elaborate & carefully thought out his ruse was in the first place. You can probably think of some more plot holes but those two will do for now.Another thing I hated when I first saw this movie was all the shots of Scotty following Madeline. Do we really need 30 minutes of watching her make a left turn as she leads Scotty to an art museum or cemetery or flower shop? Zzzzzzzzzzz. And how myopic would she have to be not to notice him following her (Oops. Guess that last sentence should've been in the previous paragraph)?But then a strange thing happened. Over the course of the next few years I watched this movie a 2nd time. Then a 3rd. And a 4th. And slowly I started to feel myself pleasantly being sucked into this movie-it's swirling, inexorable, gravitational pull on me similar to that on the main character. Because that's why those long scenes of Scotty following her are there Madeline is pulling him down into a whirlpool of obsession that he will soon not be able to escape from. Notice that in just about all the shots in which he's following her, she's leading him down and to the left. In a circular motion. And even in the Church he walks through to get to the cemetery, notice the music repeating back on its self (like a circle) & always descending. (ASIDE Three times Scotty follows Madeline up instead of down. All three times he loses her&#x97;two times up the mission tower & one time up to the hotel room she's renting. It's true he follows Judy up to her room but that's the one time he & we don't know she's Madeline.)And speaking of the music, I personally think that's maybe the most seductive element in this movie. In fact, the score is so gloriously & emotionally evocative, Bernard Hermann deserves as much authorship of VERTIGO as Hitchcock himself in my mind. Because in the same way that we learn to love a song only after listening to it several times, this movie rewards multiple viewings.There's no evidence to suggest that Hitchcock thought of this movie as being more important or more personal than any other movie (at least from anything I've read or seen on the subject) but it would be easy to make that leap. Because as has been pointed out by Brian De Palma (who made not one, not two, but THREE movies heavily influenced by VERTIGO OBSESSION, BODY DOUBLE, & FEMME FATALE) and others is that this movie captures a director's relationship with his leading lady (more specifically Hitchcock's relationships with all his blonde goddesses).Scotty falls in love with Madeline, a woman who doesn't really exist. Directors fall in love with (i.e. decide to hire) a leading lady who doesn't really exist. They watch an actress playing a part in a movie & decide that actress would be perfect for their movie. Turns out Madeline is really just plain, ordinary Judy. Turns out the leading lady the director hired is just a human being-not the glamorous, bigger-than-life, 40-foot goddess he saw up their on the silver screen in her previous movie. Scotty then tries to turn Judy back into Madeline. The director-through make-up, costumes, cinematography-tries to turn his leading lady back into the gorgeous, bigger-than-life goddess he initially saw & fell in love with. Perhaps this is the metaphor Hitchcock was trying to express. Who can say? But what we can say for sure is that VERTIGO was just voted the greatest movie ever made by the most credible entity that conducts such polls SIGHT AND SOUND. Why? Again, who can say? But my own personal opinion is that what VERTIGO is really about has to do with why we love movies our love of and obsession with illusion.

Seems a loose end Elster would not allow considering how elaborate & carefully thought out his ruse was in the first place. You can probably think of some more plot holes but those two will do for now.Another thing I hated when I first saw this movie was all the shots of Scotty following Madeline. Do we really need 30 minutes of watching her make a left turn as she leads Scotty to an art museum or cemetery or flower shop? Zzzzzzzzzzz. And how myopic would she have to be not to notice him following her (Oops. Guess that last sentence should've been in the previous paragraph)?But then a strange thing happened. Over the course of the next few years I watched this movie a 2nd time. Then a 3rd. And a 4th. And slowly I started to feel myself pleasantly being sucked into this movie-it's swirling, inexorable, gravitational pull on me similar to that on the main character. Because that's why those long scenes of Scotty following her are there Madeline is pulling him down into a whirlpool of obsession that he will soon not be able to escape from. Notice that in just about all the shots in which he's following her, she's leading him down and to the left. In a circular motion. And even in the Church he walks through to get to the cemetery, notice the music repeating back on its self (like a circle) & always descending. (ASIDE Three times Scotty follows Madeline up instead of down. All three times he loses her&#x97;two times up the mission tower & one time up to the hotel room she's renting. It's true he follows Judy up to her room but that's the one time he & we don't know she's Madeline.)And speaking of the music, I personally think that's maybe the most seductive element in this movie. In fact, the score is so gloriously & emotionally evocative, Bernard Hermann deserves as much authorship of VERTIGO as Hitchcock himself in my mind. Because in the same way that we learn to love a song only after listening to it several times, this movie rewards multiple viewings.There's no evidence to suggest that Hitchcock thought of this movie as being more important or more personal than any other movie (at least from anything I've read or seen on the subject) but it would be easy to make that leap. Because as has been pointed out by Brian De Palma (who made not one, not two, but THREE movies heavily influenced by VERTIGO OBSESSION, BODY DOUBLE, & FEMME FATALE) and others is that this movie captures a director's relationship with his leading lady (more specifically Hitchcock's relationships with all his blonde goddesses).Scotty falls in love with Madeline, a woman who doesn't really exist. Directors fall in love with (i.e. decide to hire) a leading lady who doesn't really exist. They watch an actress playing a part in a movie & decide that actress would be perfect for their movie. Turns out Madeline is really just plain, ordinary Judy. Turns out the leading lady the director hired is just a human being-not the glamorous, bigger-than-life, 40-foot goddess he saw up their on the silver screen in her previous movie. Scotty then tries to turn Judy back into Madeline. The director-through make-up, costumes, cinematography-tries to turn his leading lady back into the gorgeous, bigger-than-life goddess he initially saw & fell in love with.

There was Joe (nudity and casual drug use), Little Big Man (portrayal of gay characters), and Looking For Mr. Goodbar (promiscuous sex). You only needed to see Deliverance one time to be affected by it forever. No amount of time can pass that will allow you to forget it's most memorable scenes - Dueling Banjos, THAT scene with Ned Beatty, Drew's horrific drowning and the dislocated arm, and finally Ed's nightmare hand coming up out of the water of the newly formed lake.I just watched the film again and the passage of time has not diminished it's forceful impact. The picture has a unique ability to put you in a canoe right alongside it's principal players and force one to react to the events on screen as a participant. It sets up all sorts of moral dilemmas regarding a reaction to Lewis's (Burt Reynolds) shooting of the mountain man, the hiding of the body, and of course the forcible rape of Bobby (Beatty). The reactions of the four principals run the gamut of emotions, and it's an uncomfortable prospect to determine which of the adventurers one identifies with most.The way director Boorman works with nature also needs to be commended. The rapids scene in which the men capsize and fight for their life is extremely well staged and is executed flawlessly. On the matter of Drew's (Ronny Cox) death, the picture sets up a myriad of conflicting opinions on how he fell into the river, leading to a unique topic of discussion all by itself. Personally, I've come to consider that he simply blacked out over his participation in the hiding of the mountain man's body, although the idea of suicide crossed my mind as well. The suspicion of a gunshot was a variable to add another layer of complexity to the men's plight, all occurring in rapid succession to make their situation all the more bewildering. This whole sequence was very finely crafted.There's another aspect of the picture worth mentioning as well, that being the unlikely manner in which Ed (Jon Voight) becomes the leader of the survivors after Lewis's injury. Recall that earlier scene in which Ed has difficulty in bearing down on a deer with his bow and arrow. This sets up the later scene in which he must find the fortitude to shoot the mountain man before he himself is killed. When I first saw the picture back in the day, it immediately brought to mind a similar scene in Straw Dogs (another groundbreaking film for it's use of violence) in which Dustin Hoffman's character agonized over shooting a bird, then wiping the blood off his hands in an effort to cleanse himself of an awful deed. Of course, Hoffman goes on a rampage to close out that story to protect his wife and property. Similarly, though to a lesser degree, Voight's character calls upon his remaining wits and strength to save the remainder of his party.There's one thing though that I would have changed in the story to make the ending more powerful. In Ed's nightmare, Drew's hand comes up out of the water and Ed wakes up in a cold sweat. I would have preferred an ending in which that actually occurred, thereby adding one more element of ambiguity to the story whereby the potential for discovering Drew's body along with the two dead hillbillies is left an open question. Even so, there's still enough here to marvel at in terms of conflict and suspense. It's a film worth watching for all of it's discomfort.

In other words, it's an imitation of an American action movie.It was remade in 1993, as Point of No Return, with Bridget Fonda in the starring role of the drugged-out psychopath coerced and trained to be a cool government assassin. Let's see -- that would make the later production an American imitation of a French imitation of an American action movie. A few shots are identical. Bridget Fonda is cuter than Anne Parillaud and sexier too, but she's not nearly Parillaud's equal as an expressive actress. Watch Parillaud's infantile delight when she dines out with her government mentor and he gives her a birthday present in the fancy restaurant.There's quite a bit of gore but not nearly as much as in most American action films of the 80s. After that initial shoot out, deaths tend to take place in singles, not in grand slams. Released from the Institute (or whatever the agency is called) and only drafted for occasional special killings, Parillaud begins to enjoy her freedom. She has an affair with Jean-Hugues Anglade, an affable guy with a kind but slightly goofy face. This generates a bit of jealousy on the part of her government guru, Tchéky Karyo, who has developed a subdued yen for her. But it's just as well he doesn't get her. He has a face like a tractor with a steel plow attached to its front end.I don't know how well the chips fall into place from a psychological point of view. Parillaud is a real beast at the beginning, a maniacal puppet who tries to bite the ear off her judo instructor. She beans her mentor over the head with a crockery pot and he almost bleeds out. She breaks into wild dances for no reason. I would think professional assassins need to be something other than impulsive and unthinking.

Other camp horror movies would just get to the splatter without building it up (20 minutes of boredom like in Italian horror does not count), but here we get a solid setup of the location and the fact something's not quite right with it, rays of light casting bizarre patterns into dust and cobwebs, strange relics from some sufficiently Other-sounding land in the basement... The right setup can revitalize the hoariest horror clichés the monster in the basement, the oppressiveness of the woods, etc.With moments of quiet, mounting dread, Raimi somehow manages to induce all sorts of ruminations on mortality, which lends a frightening dimension to the film's macabre mythology, and how death relates to it. Basically, the movie unpretentiously provokes big but simple ideas by evoking the unknown as a source of horror, and then your brain starts doing most of the work in freaking you out. The occasional shades of black comedy (that Raimi would emphasize to cartoonish effect in the sequels) take on a certain uncomfortable cruelty here.And then of course Ash's mental breakdown scene allows Raimi to flex his art-house muscles, with plenty of claustrophobic, oblique camera angles, as well as the dada-esque recontextualization of familiar sounds, their complete displacement creating all sorts of morbid, absurd suggestions. It was a strange stroke of genius to give panning across floorboards a sound like ...wuhb... wuhb... wuhb... I'd be hard-pressed to think of a movie less boring than this one. It just works.

Well, the opening sequence alone was enough to scare the crap out of us, and we spent the rest of the movie peeking out from under the quilt.And even now, 15 years later, after seeing it numerous times, it's still scary as hell. The first ten minutes would have to go down as the best first ten minutes of any horror movie, ever. I had no idea Drew Barrymore's character was going to die, I thought she was the star (and I've read recently that that was the whole point, Drew was offered the role of Sidney but wanted to play Kasey instead to throw the audience off and have them realise anyone could die). And die she did, in circumstances I can only describe as my worst nightmare. When her parents came home and she was around the side of the house trying to call out to them, I was screaming throw the phone at them, throw the PHONE!!!!. After that we meet Sidney, played very well by Neve Campbell, very believable as the tortured victim who just can't seem to escape the drama. Although I rolled my eyes when she was home alone, getting prank calls, and went out on the front porch after the man on the phone told her he was on...her front porch. And I am still a little bit confused as to why she went to that party at the end, I mean she was attacked in her home, the killer called her friends house, she was attacked again in the school toilets, so she goes to party in the middle of nowhere with one dopey cop as the only protection? Then has sex with the prime suspect. I must admit I didn't guess the killers straight away. I thought it was Billy for awhile, but then when they arrested him halfway in I assumed they wanted you to think it was Billy but it wouldn't be, then he got stabbed by the killer and I instantly thought it must be Randy, then when Stu said he was going to get a beer and he never returned, I realised it must be him, otherwise he would have seen his girlfriend hanging in the doggy door and raised the alarm. My mother guesses every single killer in every movie. She said Billy and Stu shared a look at the fountain, a look in the video store, and a look when Billy turned up at Stu's party. And when I watched it again, I realised she was right, it was pretty obvious. Overall, a great horror movie, I loved all the sequels including the fourth movie that I saw recently.
