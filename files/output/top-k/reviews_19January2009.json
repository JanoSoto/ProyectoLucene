As she takes the album away, Anita lists off a few things that Elaine has banned from their house (sugar, then butter, white flour, then rock-'n-roll albums, and of course then it was celebrating Christmas on a day in September when you knew it wouldn't be commercialized...), and ultimately swears (she says feck) at Elaine, expressing Anita's extreme hatred of her. Later on, Elaine--after being pushed by Anita--confesses to William that he's actually 11, as opposed to his assumption of being 12--she put him in grade 1 when he was 5, and he skipped 5th grade.

They talk for a while about music, and how rock is basically dead. Lester gives William an assignment 1000 words on Black Sabbath. Reluctantly, Elaine gives him a ride to Black Sabbath's concert. William feels a bit embarrassed and leaves for the concert--if your mother yells to you, Don't take drugs!, when almost everyone around you is high, wouldn't you feel embarrassed? As he attempts to get in, the bouncer doesn't let him in. This is when he first meets Penny Lane (Kate Hudson), and the Band-Aids. The Band-Aids are girls who are there for the music, not to try and sleep with the band, unlike groupies. As he waits around hopelessly, he comes upon Sabbath's opening band, Stillwater. He tries to get an interview, but as they see that he's a journalist (they call him The Enemy), they don't let him. However, he talks to them about how he loves their band, and says how he loves Fever Dog, which is the first song that the band plays on stage. This brings him into a bit of a friendship with the band. William finds Penny again, and tells her that he's only 15. He asks her for her real name, with no success--it's a question he'll ask every now and then in the movie. Eventually, Stillwater asks him to come along with them on their tour, on their bus Doris. William gets a job offer from Ben Fong-Torres, from Rolling Stone magazine, who's under the assumption that William is much older. William doesn't disillusion Ben and accepts the offer. Elaine is very reluctant, but she eventually accepts it. She doesn't want William to miss more than 1 test. That promise will be broken a couple of times. Most of the movie shows William, Penny, and Stillwater and their adventures across America together.There's more to it than meets the eye. Watch the movie, see what you think of it. I can't say whether or not you won't be disappointed, but you can be the judge on that.

What stood out for me was the lack of mid-movie conflict that so many movies have, where the main characters get mad at each other because when it comes time to explain themselves they just don't say the one thing that you're shouting at the screen that would make sense of the whole deal, that any person of reasonable intellect would know to say. This is what I like the most about the movie I guess, that the main characters don't do mean things to each other halfway through... they don't break up and make up, they just grow to like each other more as the movie goes on.These two kids team up and though they seem at first to be from opposite sides of the track, they're not that different. Loui is actually just some middle class kid that needed to realize how lucky he was to have a loving family, and Cecelia was an upper class kid that just needed to prove to her family that she existed and they would miss her if she was gone. Anyway, I saw this movie posted on Hulu and had to watch it again... sure there's plot holes if you analyze the script and no, Woog and Dweeb shouldn't be eating hot dogs since they would have been herbivores in reality.Now, what detracts from the film is it's unexpected scariness. Little kids under the age of 5 would probably be frightened by the scenes with Dr. Screweyes. And, the addition of him halfway through the movie (though it's blatantly obvious in the first scene that he will make an appearance) is too abrupt... there should be a glimpse of him doing his show earlier in the movie, perhaps to show that it's not that scary without the the dinosaurs. I guess it just lacked any real present danger for the entire first half of the movie, so that it lacks a little continuity when he appears for the second half.Considering the target audience, who I'm sure can overlook the not so mind blowing animation and dialog issues... I think I'll give it a pass on those factors too, and just enjoy the story. It's a great flick for kid and it does stick in your mind... makes you kinda think about how you treat people and it should be revisited every 10 years I think.

In Europe they tended to be a little less keen to ditch the qualities of silent pictures, and their early talkies are generally low on dialogue and use sound more as an embellishment than a means of imparting information. Although Austrian-born Josef von Sternberg was a Hollywood director, even in his US talkies he focused largely on the imagery and made the dialogue almost superfluous. The German studio was therefore perhaps a little more suited to von Sternberg's method than those back in the states. In the Blue Angel the sound is simply another layer on top of all the shadows and clutter of the von Sternberg visual style. For example, he uses abrupt sounds to punctuate a scene, such as the door shutting and cutting off the music. This auditory punctuation would be explored further in his next film, Morocco.The music of the Blue Angel is also effectively employed as a backdrop to the action. You can see what I call von Sternberg's eyes across a crowded room technique (where the romantic leads make eye contact, and we cut from crowd shots to increasingly close shots of their faces) in his silent pictures. Now that it's done while a song plays out it has much more weight, much more rhythm, and the wordlessness of that eye contact is emphasised. The eyes moment in the Blue Angel is actually a little lacklustre compared to the brilliantly intense equivalent in Morocco, but this is understandable as the resulting relationship is less fiery.As with all the Dietrich\/Sternberg collaborations, the centre of the Blue Angel is of course Marlene. A relatively inexperienced performer, in her first sound film, and coming from the German tradition of screen acting which tended to be exaggerated and theatrical, and yet she delivers such a natural, believable performance. With her singing voice and good vocal delivery the sound revolution is also a boon for her. The authenticity of Marlene's acting is in fact somewhat out of kilter with the heavy stylisation of von Sternberg's direction, and many of their films together were in fact saved by her performance. It's a shame though that in all these pictures she plays essentially the same character, because (unlike von Sternberg) she had a fantastic range.It's a pity too that, in contrast to Marlene, Emil Jannings is seemingly incapable of playing any role without some degree of comical overstatement. Fine, if that's what you need (as in, say, Faust), but here it doesn't quite fit in, particularly in the earliest scenes. Of course, it's important that Professor Rath is a bit of a buffoon so that we see a hint of the clown in the schoolteacher, but the effect would have been so much stronger had Jannings given a realistic portrayal of stuffiness and pomposity, rather than this caricature.It's funny how, as well as this being the launch pad for Dietrich's career, it meant that Marlene herself would give a few more years of life to Sternberg's. It wasn't just Sternberg's irascibility and desire for creative control that cut short his career (after all look how far John Ford got on much the same reputation) &#x96; it was also the fact that he cared far more about playing about with lights than he did about bringing out the storyline or the quality of acting &#x96; and that was a problem for producers (not to mention the audience!). But, for the time being, he had established a star\/director partnership which meant his pictures would be a success.

While that is correct as a very basic summary it doesn't do justice to the excellent film set in a part of the war rarely featured in movies that tend to concentrate on engagements involving Commonwealth or US forces.The film follows Vassili Zaitsev, a young soldier played by Jude Law, as he goes to Stalingrad and it thrown into battle without even a rifle, he is just told to take one from his comrades when they are killed. After the battle he hides in a fountain where he meets political officer Danilov. Danilov wants to shoot the Germans who are in a nearby ruined building but can't do it so gives the rifle to Vassili who dispatches five of them without them returning a single shot. The political officer sees that Vassili can be used as a propaganda tool, both to inspire other Soviets and to demoralise the Germans. As he kills more and more senior Germans he does indeed become a hero and the Germans send their top sniper to Stalingrad to kill him. What follows is a cat and mouse game where each tries to lure the other into a trap so that they can kill them.In the background to this action there is a love story between Vassili and a female soldier called Tania, the situation is complicated by the fact that Danilov also fancies her and as she can speak German he gets her transferred to his department.The story is well told and exciting with great performance from Jude Law, Ed Harris (German sniper Erwin König), Rachel Weisz (Tania) and Joseph Fiennes (Danilov). While the love story wasn't strictly necessary it didn't distract from the main story and was well executed. While it only tells one small story amongst one of the largest battles of the Second World War it is still a film that most fans of war films will enjoy.

I must admit that I wasn't looking forward to watching this movie initially, but I'm glad I did; I wasn't disappointed by this superior second installment.This second film in the Hellraiser series ups the ante in its blood-drenched delights and special effects, in addition to actually being quite scary. Most will make remarks about the extreme level of violence and gore in this film, but Randel is good in making sure it fits in with the relentlessly grim tone of the film and doesn't make it mindless schlock.The film takes place right after the events of Hellraiser young Kirsty Cotton (Ashley Laurence) was the sole survivor of that film (pre-credit flashbacks re-tell Hellraiser's story), and as Hellbound opens, Kirsty has been locked up inside a mental hospital and no one believes her claims about Juila (Clare Higgins), Frank (Sean Chapman), the Cenobites, and the puzzle box that opens up a gateway to a dimension of pain, suffering, and pleasure.An occult-obsessed doctor, Dr. Channard (Kenneth Cranham), believes her story and in his eternal desire for pleasure, he resurrects Julia and the two soon become lovers. However, Channard's naive young assistant Kyle (William Hope, of Aliens) helps break Julia and a mute young girl named Tiffany (Imogen Boorman) out of the mental hospital. And in order to stop Channard, the newly resurrected Julia and the Cenobites, it's going to literally require a trip to the depths of Hell and back.Hellbound Hellraiser II doesn't play around in the gore department. Not even five minutes go by and we're treated to flesh being ripped apart by chains, hooks, and spikes. In these opening moments, we also learn of the horrific origins of Cenobite leader Pinhead (Doug Bradley). Like Hellraiser, the Cenobites are not your typical movie monsters. They are not your typical movie monsters because they are NOT the movie's main villains, and are only an element of the story (even though they figure much more prominently into this film's plot, and have greater depth, significance, and meaning in the story this time around). Like Hellraiser, Julia and Frank were the main villains in the film; here in Hellbound, Julia also returns as one primary antagonist, soon usurped by Dr. Channard.Even more amazingly, and unexpectedly, noteworthy of interest is the fact that here, the Cenobites become slight objects of sympathy, instead of horror - no longer the horrific creatures we've been led to believe that they actually are. Like Jeff Goldblum's character in The Fly (1986), the Cenobites are tragic beings because we come to see the men (and woman) they once were, although the effect works opposite because the emotional investments of pity and sympathy come AFTER they've torn someone's soul apart limb from limb.Author Clive Barker wrote the novel The Hellbound Heart from which these films are based. The man has a deeply rooted passion for blood, more blood, grisly horror, torture, razor-sharp objects, and just plain gruesome detail and excess. While I'm not sure exactly about his skills in writing dialogue, Randel does a good job of directing Peter Atkins's script while at the same time continuing Barker's first film, not repeating it, and he doesn't disappoint in terms of direction and horrific special effects (some of which was actually cut from the film so that it could be released with an R rating; an unrated version with all the violence and gore restored was recently released on DVD by Anchor Bay). The Atkins screenplay is confusing sometimes and tends to drag but once it gets going along, there's no turning back because your eyes are glued to the screen in absolute horror.Ashley Laurence remains the strong, courageous, and determined young heroine she created in Hellraiser as Kirsty Cotton. Certainly not your typical teenager ready to be torn apart limb from limb by some goon in a mask, she remains a steadfast and determined young woman who remains brave in the face of unspeakable evil. More remarkably, there's never a moment in this film when she just drops everything and strips for the males in the audience, even though she is involved in a nude-less shower sequence fairly early in the picture. Why hasn't she gotten more work as a result of her performance in this film, I ask?Hellbound Hellraiser II is a mostly superior second installment in a grisly franchise that quickly wore itself out with every subsequent sequel after this one.I'm glad I got the unrated DVD, with more skinless bodies, more ripped-apart flesh, and more suffering, sweet suffering.9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"19 January 2009","score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Hellbound Hellraiser II, Tony Randel's superior blood-soaked follow-up to writer-director Clive Barker's 1987 Hellraiser, is by far one of the few cases in the horror genre of a sequel surpassing the original.

I much prefer to have things unfold slowly and allow viewers to discover the facts for themselves.I think Shyamalan is a master of suspense, similar to Hitchcock, which happens to be one of his idols. This film has so much tension, and yet Shyamalan also allows for moments of comic relief to break up this tension as well. He pays Hitchcock several compliments by copying some of his trademarks - such as making a cameo appearance in the film (although he is a horrible actor. He should do non-speaking cameo's like Hitch). He also uses similar camera techniques like extremely close shots and unusual camera angles and perspectives. There's also a big similarity to Hitchcock's The Birds in the way that something is trying to get in the home and they have to board up all the doors and windows.Thia is one of the few scary movies I let my kids watch. It has no blood and gore like the slasher movies. It became an ongoing practical joke at my house where my husband would hide and make the alien clicking noise - and my kids would just roar with laughter. (of course they would never admit it scared them). I like that the film doesn't rely heavily on CGI or other special effects. It makes the film seem more realistic and believable, rather than the product of some big budget Hollywood production.I also like that the picture has a deeper meaning about whether we think we are alone, or believe that there are NO coincidences.I think Gibson's performance was good, but I thought Joaquin Phoenix's was even better. His portrayal of akwardness and the failings in his life are so palpable and believable. He seems to be more a 3rd child in the film than Graham's adult counterpart. I absolutely love the scene where he joins the 2 kids on the sofa with the aluminum foil hats. We laughed hysterically. Abigail Breslin's performance was amazing given her very young age - and is a testament to the skilled direction of Shyamalan.In addition to some comic relief, there are some tender moments - like when Graham relays the story of the kids birth to them at a very tense moment. I had tears in my eyes at how delicately and intimately Gibson delivers these lines - you forget that he's reciting lines and truly believe what he's saying.I loved the music score - especially the opening credits. It has a chaotic and tense melody. I think the accompanying graphics were cool as well. But the music is a very crucial part in the building of suspense. And the movie gets off to a fast start with the little girl screaming and also sets the stage for a fast pace in the rest of the film.Word of warning - I have caught this on TV and it is guilty of cutting out key scenes (must be in order to fit in time slot because there is nothing inappropriate about the cut scenes).

I much prefer to have things unfold slowly and allow viewers to discover the facts for themselves.I think Shyamalan is a master of suspense, similar to Hitchcock, which happens to be one of his idols. This film has so much tension, and yet Shyamalan also allows for moments of comic relief to break up this tension as well. He pays Hitchcock several compliments by copying some of his trademarks - such as making a cameo appearance in the film (although he is a horrible actor. He should do non-speaking cameo's like Hitch). He also uses similar camera techniques like extremely close shots and unusual camera angles and perspectives. There's also a big similarity to Hitchcock's The Birds in the way that something is trying to get in the home and they have to board up all the doors and windows.Thia is one of the few scary movies I let my kids watch. It has no blood and gore like the slasher movies. It became an ongoing practical joke at my house where my husband would hide and make the alien clicking noise - and my kids would just roar with laughter. (of course they would never admit it scared them). I like that the film doesn't rely heavily on CGI or other special effects. It makes the film seem more realistic and believable, rather than the product of some big budget Hollywood production.I also like that the picture has a deeper meaning about whether we think we are alone, or believe that there are NO coincidences.I think Gibson's performance was good, but I thought Joaquin Phoenix's was even better. His portrayal of akwardness and the failings in his life are so palpable and believable. He seems to be more a 3rd child in the film than Graham's adult counterpart. I absolutely love the scene where he joins the 2 kids on the sofa with the aluminum foil hats. We laughed hysterically. Abigail Breslin's performance was amazing given her very young age - and is a testament to the skilled direction of Shyamalan.In addition to some comic relief, there are some tender moments - like when Graham relays the story of the kids birth to them at a very tense moment. I had tears in my eyes at how delicately and intimately Gibson delivers these lines - you forget that he's reciting lines and truly believe what he's saying.I loved the music score - especially the opening credits. It has a chaotic and tense melody. I think the accompanying graphics were cool as well. But the music is a very crucial part in the building of suspense. And the movie gets off to a fast start with the little girl screaming and also sets the stage for a fast pace in the rest of the film.Word of warning - I have caught this on TV and it is guilty of cutting out key scenes (must be in order to fit in time slot because there is nothing inappropriate about the cut scenes). So be sure to get the DVD so you don't miss anything.

Willis, known for his fabulous work with dark, muted colors and characters in shadows or silhouettes, seems absolutely lost within this night-life milieu, which isn't bright and hardly seems big. Jay McInerney adapted his own 1984 novel about a would-be writer in New York City whose job in the research department of a prominent magazine (Gotham!) is constantly threatened by his drug use, which may stem from a broken marriage and memories of his deceased mother. It's not difficult to pinpoint what went wrong here although Michael J. Fox may seem well-cast from the outset, it clearly becomes apparent he's in over his head. Fox (whose plastic voice-over narration was probably supposed to sound hard-boiled) is too well-scrubbed and corn-fed to be convincing as a party maniac; acting disoriented by blinking his eyes heavily and tightening his thin mouth, Fox is strictly a morose good-time guy, mourning the separation from fashion model spouse Phoebe Cates. But there's nothing at stake for this kid when he stays up all night (except for his job at the magazine, which hardly matters to us since the sequences set there are wholly unconvincing). Director James Bridges takes an episodic approach to the narrative, but his continuity (or perhaps the editing) is sloppy and gummy, and the people in Fox's small circle aren't terribly interesting. And did the movie go through a budgetary crisis? The weak nightclubbing scenes look barren and cheap (aside from some city vistas and subway rides, the picture could easily take place in Passaic, New Jersey for all we know).

Under the bizarre scenario, and seemingly unrelated events, Fletch does a little snooping around and finds more to the picture than what he had anticipated. Chase puts his best comedic efforts to use as Fletch dons multiple disguises as he encounters different people and environments, in an attempt to uncover the mystery.It's a lighthearted comedy with a hint of darkness to it, and the combination gives us a package full of laughs, action\/adventure, and intriguing suspense, and I'd also like to note a classic, extremely catchy, synthesized 80s score.

This film is a 180-degree shift from the idealistic rhetoric portrayed in offerings like The Longest Day and The Green Berets which seem more like Disney fantasies by comparison. The Apocalypse Now! project, the production and resulting film, is Heart of Darkness updated into a psychological horror story of the late 20th century post-modernist variety. The cast and crew who worked on it probably could relate to the terrifying places the human mind can achieve. This is the plight of Joseph Conrad's original character Kurtz who came into literary being in 1901 and subsequently referenced in TS Eliot's The Hollow Men (Mistah Kurtz, he dead) of 1925. Although neither a straight telling of Conrad's Heart of Darkness (1901) nor a first-hand account of the Vietnam experience, Apocalypse Now! stands as a masterpiece which pushed on the envelope of cinematic potential. Apocalypse is not just about the horrors of war per se, like Platoon and The Deer Hunter, but the darker sensibilities of human nature as revealed through the raw and demeaning confrontations of violent conflict on a mass scale. Apocalypse Now! is not so much seen as experienced.The bulk of the movie is the journey of a trained secret assassin, Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen in a tour-de-force performance), aboard a US military boat traversing an unnamed river into the heart of Vietnam and Cambodia where few westerners would ever tread. His mission is to terminate Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a career army Special Forces Division officer who was the darling of the US Military until he went AWOL and renegade in the deep uncharted jungles between Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. The official classified report is that the colonel has gone insane but as events play out, something else has happened to him that is far more terrifying than simply insanity. Sheen's mission is to terminate the colonel with the American public none the wiser.The movie is rather episodic. The journey along the river is made up of several vignettes as Sheen and his crew meet different self-contained aspects of the war at the ground level. American audiences of the 1970's had probably never seen this kind of film-making before, with the possible exception of The Deer Hunter which was released in the previous year. The first, and one of the most notable, is an helicopter battalion led by Col Kilgore (Robert Duvall in an Oscar-nominated performance) who is a cross between General Robert E Lee and Richard Wagner. He loves to play Ride of the Valkyries from Wagner's The Ring when he bombards helpless villages. His line I love the smell of Napalm in the morning is one of those oft-quoted lines from the annals of cinema. Other encounters include an amphitheater where enlisted privates will be entertained by the likes of Hugh Heffner and Playboy bunnies.Despite all the production catastrophes that impeded getting this footage into the can, the remarkable aspect of this film is its pacing. The original release (not the later Redux version) does a fine of job of building until the viewer is emotionally prepared to deal with the climactic confrontation between Willard and Kurtz. The strange discourse between Willard and Kurtz is worth the price of admission alone. And some of the shots of both Sheen and Brando in certain places are some of the starkest and terrifying images ever produced on film. Not even the likes of Clive Barker, Wes Craven or David Cronenberg have anything on Coppola in terms of horrific imagery. Brando's Kurtz in one scene in particular is so utterly terrifying it makes most other horror movies seem tame by comparison, which comes from the recognition that the horror is not from without but from within.Without giving too much away, Coppola's solution to the climactic moment stands as one of the most innovative of cinematic revelations. According to the documentary Hearts of Darkness, Coppola feared that the inevitable final scene would lapse into melodrama, and the atmosphere of the movie's darker hues would be compromised. He wasn't sure how he could make it work until his wife encouraged the director to witness the ceremonial sacrifice of an ox as practiced by the native people with whom Coppola was using as extras in the scenes with Kurtz at his village. After the viewing, Coppola had his ending, and it is one of the most simultaneously disturbing and beautiful sequences in the history of American film-making. Love it or hate it, no western viewer will be the same after seeing this scene.This film is not for all tastes just as Conrad's original novel is not the kind of book that will be read on airplanes. It's not just the violence and the pointlessness of violence that are difficult for most American viewers to absorb. It's the naked unveiling of aspects of the human condition that seem so removed from suburban American life that make this film difficult for the average movie-goer to handle, which is as it should be. Coppola did not make a family picture. However, if the viewer can understand its larger point, there is a lot to be gotten out of Apocalypse Now!. If you're looking for a film experience to reaffirm pre-existing attitudes about American sensibility and heroism, better stick with John Wayne. But if you're willing to be taken into places you've never been, even beyond the evils of war rhetoric, Apocalypse Now will take you into a world you thought you'd never visited before, and the disturbing part of it is that you may recognize it.

Other encounters include an amphitheater where enlisted privates will be entertained by the likes of Hugh Heffner and Playboy bunnies.Despite all the production catastrophes that impeded getting this footage into the can, the remarkable aspect of this film is its pacing. The original release (not the later Redux version) does a fine of job of building until the viewer is emotionally prepared to deal with the climactic confrontation between Willard and Kurtz. The strange discourse between Willard and Kurtz is worth the price of admission alone. And some of the shots of both Sheen and Brando in certain places are some of the starkest and terrifying images ever produced on film. Not even the likes of Clive Barker, Wes Craven or David Cronenberg have anything on Coppola in terms of horrific imagery. Brando's Kurtz in one scene in particular is so utterly terrifying it makes most other horror movies seem tame by comparison, which comes from the recognition that the horror is not from without but from within.Without giving too much away, Coppola's solution to the climactic moment stands as one of the most innovative of cinematic revelations. According to the documentary Hearts of Darkness, Coppola feared that the inevitable final scene would lapse into melodrama, and the atmosphere of the movie's darker hues would be compromised. He wasn't sure how he could make it work until his wife encouraged the director to witness the ceremonial sacrifice of an ox as practiced by the native people with whom Coppola was using as extras in the scenes with Kurtz at his village. After the viewing, Coppola had his ending, and it is one of the most simultaneously disturbing and beautiful sequences in the history of American film-making. Love it or hate it, no western viewer will be the same after seeing this scene.This film is not for all tastes just as Conrad's original novel is not the kind of book that will be read on airplanes. It's not just the violence and the pointlessness of violence that are difficult for most American viewers to absorb. It's the naked unveiling of aspects of the human condition that seem so removed from suburban American life that make this film difficult for the average movie-goer to handle, which is as it should be. Coppola did not make a family picture. However, if the viewer can understand its larger point, there is a lot to be gotten out of Apocalypse Now!. If you're looking for a film experience to reaffirm pre-existing attitudes about American sensibility and heroism, better stick with John Wayne. But if you're willing to be taken into places you've never been, even beyond the evils of war rhetoric, Apocalypse Now will take you into a world you thought you'd never visited before, and the disturbing part of it is that you may recognize it.

She's the lady of the title, but the Deadswood townsfolk certainly don't think this gun-toting tomboy is a lady. It takes a Woman's Touch to turn Calamity into a stunner, and by then, her best friend Wild Bill Hickok (Howard Keel)has lost his heart. Doris Day is so likable in this film-- full of charisma, talent and enthusiasm for her role. If Oscars voters in 1953 had any sense, she would have gained a nomination for her wonderful work here. This Warners Bros musical was obviously influenced by the big success of MGM's version of the stage hit Annie Get Your Gun, which also starred Howard Keel. Keel gets a similar role, perfect partner for the independent lady if they ever stop disagreeing. Keel and Day worked very well together, and their number I Could Do Without You is energetic, fun and one of the best in the film. Keel is so sexy and charming. As with Annie Get Your Gun, with Betty Hutton as the sharpshooter, Day's Calamity has to have a make-over first for men to notice her finer qualities. Yep, it's probably sexist now but I see it more as an encouragement for women to embrace their femininity, which, like it or not, is always there. I'm a tomboy myself, and I enjoyed seeing Day mix it with the boys--even if she does end up in a dress by film's end.

Harking back to Joseph Conrad and the days of high adventure so beloved of the writer-director, this WW2 tale of a deserter who becomes a king in Borneo only to lose everything fighting the Japanese and betrayed by the Allies, it seemed made to measure for his brand of bravado and myth making. Even had Milius not ill-advisedly taken Spielberg's advice to trim half an hour from his original cut and the film not been released in two slightly different cuts on either side of the Atlantic, Farewell would almost certainly still have been an awkward and under-achieving film so problematic are many aspects yet for all its many faults, there's enough there that IS unique to keep on drawing me back time and again. Part old-fashioned adventure, part folie de grandeur, all box-office disaster, it's a mess, but it's an intriguing one that's hard to dislike despite its many flaws, and Basil Poledouris' remarkable score is a thing of wonder.The performances are variable Nigel Havers is fine as the narrator who knows that one day he'll have to betray the King, but in a part that really calls for a Steve McQueen or a Russell Crowe, Nick Nolte has a few too many eccentric moments and isn't always able to make Milius' dialogue sound as good as it reads (a common problem in many of his scripts). Frank McRae, Marius Weyers and Milius' old surfing buddy Gerry Lopez offer good support, but there's a truly terrible but mercifully brief performance from the future Mrs Milius, Elan Oberon. The film feels somewhat cramped at times due to Milius' decision not to shoot in Scope (he dislikes 2.351 despite doing his most visually impressive work in the ratio), although cinematographer Dean Semler pulls off an impressive sequence where a night time ambush goes horribly wrong due to a sudden shift in the weather.It would have been interesting to see what author Pierre Schoendoerffer would have made of it had he been able to direct it himself. Like Milius an unashamed admirer of Joseph Conrad (the story is basically a WW2 reworking of Lord Jim), the French writer-director's own films, particularly the haunting Le Crabe Tambour, hint at a more melancholy, less gung-ho attack on the material. But Milius' film has enough going for it to make it worth a look.The US cut recently released on Region 1 DVD by MGM\/UA is different in quite a few ways to the European version. For a start, it's shorter, although it has some additional footage the battle montage as the Japanese retreat is much longer (the entire battle at the river is cut from the European versions), while there's a scene of James Fox reminiscing about a girl he knew in India that is missing from the European cut, as well as a few additional lines of dialogue in some scenes. However, there is a huge and fairly important scene cut from near the end of the picture, where Fairbourne (Havers) visits the Japanese general as he has his last meal before his execution it's not an entirely successful scene, but the film works better with it than without. There's also a big structural difference, with the US cut showing Learoyd deserting and watching his companions being executed as a pretitle sequence - this footage is in the European cut, but much more comfortably included much later when Learoyd is telling the story of how he became king. Also, the opening quote has been dropped and replaced with title cards specifying the date and location, while the closing narration is longer. On the whole, aside from the missing battle montage footage, the European version plays better.It was too much to hope for deleted scenes or even Milius' original two-and-a-half hour cut of the film on the R1 disc, but MGM\/UA could have at least included the trailer &#150; but unfortunately the disc is completely extras free.

Firstly, it pokes good fun at service providers. Who hasn't been irritated by the cable company or the phone company saying we'll be there anywhere between 8 and 5. Secondly, I liked the darkness of the fun, as the cable guy turns out to be a lonely psychopath who ends up stalking his customers in an effort to be their best friend, and who, when the overtures of friendship are rejected, sets out to destroy their lives. All that had great potential - and then, in stepped Jim Carrey.Some people love him. I know that.

Apart from Diane Baker (as the heroine's daughter, who had witnessed the initial massacre as a child), Crawford is obviously the whole show here she approaches the role as if it were the logical continuation of her long run of glossy (but histrionic) melodramas of the 1940s and 1950s. This one is high-strung, to be sure &#150; indeed, one could only sensibly classify it as Camp (never more so perhaps than, when drunk, the star unaccountably and shamelessly seduces Baker's understandably ill-at-ease suitor more than half her age)!
