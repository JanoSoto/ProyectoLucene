As if you don't know it yet, the scenes are played all jumbled and out of order.What could have turned into just a nasty trick on the viewer is actually very well-done here. You see things from the perspective of our main character who suffers from a bizarre memory loss condition. Rather than explain the plot, I will just say that if you plan on watching this movie just once, get ready to change your plans. You will need to watch it twice to fully GET it. It moves too fast for the viewer and by the time it's over you will tell yourself that you GET it, but you don't.To those who say there are no holes in this film I scoff at you. Why does Leonard have no memory loss in the murder sequence? He remembers long enough to drive all the way to that abandoned building and then wait for the murderer. In other scenes, he forgets what he is doing after two minutes. Maybe he is just psychotic and made the whole condition up in his mind to excuse a rampage? The hypotheses are endless. Personally, I'd rather watch a movie that just makes sense on it's own and no matter what you say, this one doesn't. Memento tries to do what Pulp Fiction did but takes itself way too seriously. The viewers are treated to a narrative from the character Teddy at the end when he has to explain the situation to Leonard thus explaining the movie to us. Kind of cheap, Nolan.One thing is for sure Guy Pearce is one of the best actors alive.7 out of 10, kids.

Sounds simple enough, but is it? The span and breadth of experiences we go through in our lives, the moments, the good, the bad, when we think about it, a lot of stuff happens to us so imagine having to review your whole life and find one time or memory of life that you had and make it the memory you take with you to heaven forever. What WOULD you choose? Not so easy after all, hm? Our characters find that they are only given about a week to go about this quite monumental task and this is where the story begins. We are introduced to our counselors at the so called way-station between earth and heaven who's job it is to help the dead along to heaven. We see the careful interplay between the young, the middle-aged, and the old play out in a very patient manner as each person is tasked with rifling through their memories with a little bit of help for those a bit ambiguous about their former lives. Some find the process quite hard while others are easily able to figure things out. As in real life, we begin to see the examination of life's principle tenet that who we are is really a summation of how we live. One thing I appreciated about this movie is that, other than the main actors, the wayfaring actors are just regular people with no acting skills and you just fall in love with their idiosyncrasies, quirks, and genuine reactions. You can very much imagine yourself in their shoes. This is a very simple movie that examines a very deep question. So simple, it's brilliant.

What a pay off! What a tension breaking five minutes it was! I felt I could breathe easy after happily discovering that Billy is a man that can make loving, almost predictable and sane decisions after all, and all because of Layla (Christina Ricci), the new angel in his life, who he haphazardly kidnapped in a dance studio; who he finally realizes is his savior. We never find out much about Layla, if anything at all. Where does she come from and why is she the way she is? Why does she see a loving light in despicable Billy? Why doesn't she leave him, after so much verbal abuse and selfishness? I believe the reason she doesn't is because director, writer, composer and actor Gallo understands that in most scripts out of cliché Hollywood, she WOULD leave Billy. And then what kind of movie would we have? One that we've seen time and time again. The decisions that the characters make in Buffalo '66's entire time frame are the antithesis of conventionalism.What makes Billy Brown tick is strenuously simple, but only after a fair amount of contemplation after spending time with him his parents, played by Ben Gazzara and Anjelica Huston, have systematically not given their son an ounce of validation of pride or yes, love, for his entire life, spent in frigid Buffalo, New York. Billy has spent his whole life excessively fabricating his importance in hope to gain that validation, but never with any success. Whether biological parents can demonstrate such intense apathy and coldness toward their own flesh and blood, as seen in this movie, is up for debate. But if they were able to be so callously and blindly bold, the bitter and sad result of such a man as Billy seems plausible. Gallo's skillful acting ability in his role floors me, because we actually somehow care for Billy. And why should we? Because through his sin we envision humanness that, I believe, we can all relate to the errors we make; the lack of self-worth we may feel; loneliness; rejection; and the pain that is inflicted upon us from those who are supposed to unconditionally love us the most. Ricci's astounding performance, which I believe carries the most improvisation of any character in the film, brilliantly sheds the most light on the movie's message, which is when someone cares about you more than themselves, it can truly change you for the better, no matter how much emotional baggage you may have. If we all had a Layla in our lives, psychiatrists would go into extinction.

In other blunter words, the movie is wholesale forgettable from opening to closing. If you know anything about real-life serial killers, or have seen any other cliché serial killer movie, you've seen this. Hundreds of times.It opens up just like every other first-person narrative movie, and some lines even made me wonder if they were copied directly from Fight Club. Regardless of when the two original novels were written, I think this just proves the insane unoriginality of both.Speaking of unoriginality, American Psycho is nothing but one long, bloated serial killer cliché with nothing to differentiate it from the countless others just like it. The main character is a mix of Hannibal Lector and your average no-name B-movie serial killer. He does exactly what every other serial killer ever does kill, have sex, and kill having sex. He's a dull cliché with legs. (And a butt, if you want me to mention the constant immature use of rear nudity that has no point but to make the 13-year-old girls horny.) There is no real plot, just, as I said, kill and have sex, and that's the brilliant, masterful plotting that everyone is speaking of. Kill, sex, kill, sex&#151;I think we know what sells in America. That's why American Psycho is just so safe. It's a safe idea that has been used hundreds of times&#151;kill, sex&#151;and was destine to get great reviews because it plays so safe. I think we've learned by now that safe movies get the critic's good scores, and safe movies sell. Am I really the only one who gets it? American Psycho is a movie for safe pansies who's idea of a brilliant, masterful plot is kill, sex, kill.But with all the killing, I was left wondering where is all this gore everyone is speaking of? How is this gory? Every single kill is off-screen. I've seen low-budget 60's horror movies that show more gore on screen. There isn't a single moment of brutality. There is less blood on screen than your average TV show. Did I mention this movie plays it all 100% safe? If everything I just mentioned wasn't bad enough, let me move on to the boring factor. The entire run time is a long, drawn-out talking scene. It goes from one conversation scene to another, with less action than your average drama.

American Psycho is a safe, boring, cliché drama and nothing more. It has some humor, but it's all humor you've heard before. There is no intellectual meaning, unlike what some seem to think, and it isn't entertaining.

There is less blood on screen than your average TV show. Did I mention this movie plays it all 100% safe? If everything I just mentioned wasn't bad enough, let me move on to the boring factor. The entire run time is a long, drawn-out talking scene. It goes from one conversation scene to another, with less action than your average drama. Maybe that's because, no matter what you want to believe, American Psycho is a drama. It isn't a horror movie&#151;just the idea of typing that makes me laugh&#151;and it isn't an action movie. It's just a cliché, dull drama.The only good I can manage to scrounger up - Bale knows how to act. - The chainsaw scene was interesting.Now, back to the bad for my conclusion. American Psycho is a safe, boring, cliché drama and nothing more. It has some humor, but it's all humor you've heard before. There is no intellectual meaning, unlike what some seem to think, and it isn't entertaining. It's so forgettable the exact thing I thought when the credits came on screen was I need to order some pizza . . . and didn't even remember I watched it until I sat down to write this review the next morning. There are countless movies out there exactly like this, and I sometimes wonder if I'm the only person alive who even gets that there actually ARE interesting, entertaining, original movies out there to watch. Why did I waste my time on American Psycho? 0\/10 ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"2 November 2008","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I almost quit after the first 15 boring minutes, where the only interesting part is a sex scene.

It progresses more slowly than most of its successors. During this time, the movie builds its tension like a mason, one brick at a time. A long period of time passes with no action while the plot moves relentlessly towards an electric finish. Unlike Dr. No, From Russia with Love tells an involving story. More importantly, the payoff does not disappoint. We are generously rewarded for our patience with four classic action scenes.The first is especially notable. James Bond (Sean Connery) and Donald Grant (Robert Shaw) engage in a close-quarters brawl inside a dual compartment on the Orient Express. I mention in my reviews of GoldenEye that the Bond-Jacques Bouvar fight that opens Thunderball is the series' best to that point. After re-watching these movies, my opinion has changed. On its own merits, this movie's showcase fight is superior. The wild fencing battle in Die Another Day remains at the top of the list, followed by this movie's Orient Express fight, Bond vs. Janus in GoldenEye, Bond vs. Bouvar, Bond's battle in Osato's office from You Only Live Twice, the hotel room brawl in On Her Majesty's Secret Service, and the stairwell combat in Casino Royale. Bond's cargo net encounter with Necros in The Living Daylights and his showdown with Oddjob are too unique to be evaluated on the same scale.Despite the constricted space, director Terence Young manages to clearly and effectively portray what transpires in those adjoining rooms. When he chooses to make a cut, he does so in the middle of a motion so that nothing is missed. More importantly, he makes those cuts without needing to repeat part of the strike. Bond and Grant force each other into the adjacent room many times. When that happens, Young starts with a shot containing both men and then cuts to a view of one soaring backwards. His choice of angles captures the action in tense and fascinating ways. He amplifies the intensity with many close-up shots. In them, he uses the environment to his advantage. The camera can remain practically still without losing either of the combatants. The fight took three weeks to film because Young did not settle for almost-spectacular. He fully understood that the most proficient way to photograph action is to let the quality of the production speak for itself.The quality is extremely high. Both Connery and Shaw look convincing and lethal every second of their grand struggle. Sean Connery's hair is messed up after the fight is over; I love that. Bob Simmons, who choreographed Bond action at the time, was the Vic Armstrong of his day. It introduced a new level of violence, and the audiences responded with pleasure. The other three scenes, while not possessing the same potential, are made with comparable flair.SPECTRE, which employed Dr. No in the previous 007 movie, returns as the evil organization. Ernst Stavro Blofeld (voice of Erich Pohlmann) orchestrates a sting operation targeting James Bond. He entrusts this operation to Rosa Klebb (Lotte Lenya). Under her orders, Soviet consulate worker Tatiana Romanova (Daniela Bianchi) offers the British a Soviet decoder. Her co-operation has one condition; James Bond must be the person to help her defect. Meanwhile, Grant stalks him and awaits the proper time to deal his deathblow.In Turkey, Bond works with Kerim Bey (Pedro Armendáriz), arguably his most interesting ally. Bey develops a unique rapport with James. Few of Bond's other companions could say, My friend you're not using this, while tapping the head. Bey not only gets away with it, but Bond finds his light criticism amusing. When I heard Kerim declare, I have had a particularly interesting life, I laughed because I had come to know him so well.In 20 other movies, nobody has matched the performance Sean Connery gives here. He can be caring as a loving husband or so enraged he can brutalize a helpless woman. Sean displays a lot of affection towards Bianchi. He buys several expensive dresses for her and holds her with a tenderness we do not normally see. All this time, Connery keeps it clear that James is not in love with Tatiana. Connery's James is the most business oriented here, and Sean gives his most serious performance. His every reaction is completely believable. When he smiles in awe at a belly dancer, prepares to pull the trigger with approaching strangers in his crosshairs, bemusedly teaches Romanova about their cover, and angrily jerks a door open; we see elite adeptness at non-verbal acting. Connery's finest moments come during the final conversation between James and Grant. I like all of the actors who have played Bond, but this performance may never be matched.All of the SPECTRE characters are created well. After Connery, Lenya contributes the standout performance. During her meeting with Romanova, she makes highly inappropriate physical evaluations of her. Lenya uses abrupt speech, flaring eyes and angry eyebrows to endow Klebb with a scary level of authority and sincerity. On the other end, she treats Blofeld with utter respect. She must answer to him when their project begins to fail. At this time we see how quickly she can be humbled. It is an unselfish performance by Lenya since her own beauty far exceeded Klebb's.From Russia with Love contains more outstanding acting than any other Bond movie. It is never boring, but the somewhat slow pace works against it. That minor fault prevents many people in my generation from seeing its great accomplishments. This probably is the most artistically successful of the Bond movies. The only reason more satisfying ones have been made is because the producers had superior resources.

You have the love of humanity in you.Don't hate. Only the unloved and the unnatural hate.Soldiers, don't fight for slavery, fight for liberty! St Luke says, The Kingdom of God is within man. Not in one man nor a group of men, but in all men. In you! You have the power to create machines, the power to create happiness.You have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure.In the name of democracy, let us use that power.Let us all unite, let us fight for a new world, a world that will give men a chance to work, that will give youth a future and old age security.Promising these things, brutes have risen.But they lie!

I'm not exactly sure what I thought of it at the time, and had never heard of it before, so I had no clue what the general reception of it was. I would later find out that its general reception certainly wasn't very good, probably the worst I've ever seen for a war movie! For that reason, it didn't surprise me when I finally got around to watching the entire film and it failed to impress me for the most part.Rafe McCawley and Danny Walker have been friends since childhood. By 1940, they are young men, and both join the Army Air Corps. Rafe meets a nurse named Evelyn Johnson and a romantic relationship between the two quickly begins. America has not yet entered World War II, but Rafe has volunteered to join the British in battle, so he soon finds himself far away from his new lover, and Danny and Evelyn are transferred to Pearl Harbour in Hawaii. Eventually, Rafe's plane crashes into the water, and he is presumed dead. Obviously upset about this, Danny and Evelyn begin to develop a relationship. However, it eventually turns out that Rafe is still alive, and Evelyn and Danny soon see him again! Unfortunately, Rafe soon learns about their relationship that started while he was gone, and as Japanese forces plan their surprise attack on Pearl Harbour, conflict between the two former friends begins! Pearl Harbour is often criticised for a number of things, which unsurprisingly includes historical inaccuracy. Even though I'm no history buff, I'm convinced this film is very inaccurate (even that might be an understatement, I don't know) but I've learned to expect that from films based on historical events, even ones MUCH more popular than this one. However, this film is also criticised for having poor dialogue, and after seeing it myself, while I can't say I think the dialogue is consistently horrendous throughout, I can definitely understand the criticism! Another thing is the romantic scenes, which I'm also going to have to agree with, especially early in the film, before Rafe leaves, an example being Evelyn telling the other nurses how her relationship with Rafe began. Yes, a lot of the poor dialogue comes from the romantic aspect of the story early in the film, and it sometimes gets unintentionally funny, including some of the dialogue between Rafe and Evelyn, which made me laugh quite hard at least at one point! Also, after Rafe has gone, Evelyn writes a letter to him, telling him, It's so strange to be half a world away from you, as if they knew each other for a long time before he left, which may have made me snicker or at least smile. For most of the film, the unintentional humour doesn't continue, but instead, we have some tedious action sequences, and a shallow story. There may be some mildly touching moments, but not usually, not enough to make up for a mostly dull approximate three hours the film goes on for.I thought there was a good chance I would end up disliking this film more than I did. I could have ended up joining the many viewers who found it to be a well below average blockbuster. Now that I've seen the whole thing, I think it's basically average. It's a severely flawed, unsatisfying, and overlong romantic war film, but personally, I'm not exactly displeased with it enough to trash it as much as so many others have (I guess it could have been worse, and much more poorly received movies have been made). However, I still don't consider it a worthwhile effort, I'm definite on that one. Lots of highly acclaimed war movies have come from Hollywood over the decades, but Pearl Harbour is far from one of them, and there are obvious reasons for that.

His teeth are clenched, his fists are up and he's out for blood but this time his target is mass media as represented by newspaperman Chuck Tatum played by Kirk Douglas (Michael Douglas's dad). The film opens as he's driving through Albuquerque, New Mexico. Tatum stops by the local paper, The Sun-Bulletin, to ask for a job.Kirk Douglas gives the fiercest performance of his career, an amoral newspaper reporter caught in dead end Albuquerque who happens upon the story of a lifetime, and will do anything to ensure he gets the scoop.After months of living in a rut he finally stumbles upon the perfect story. Deep within some old Indian ruins, a treasure hunter has gotten himself stuck in a cave-in (Co-relate it with our own Prince story which bombarded our TVs couple of years back). Guy in a well. That'll sell papers, right? What follows is genius, as Tatum engineers the story to be far bigger than it really is. We watch as he manipulates the rescue engineers, the local sheriff, the victim's wife, all with the intent of prolonging the incident. He wants to keep the guy underground as long as possible. This gives Tatum time to write more stories, sell them at top dollar to other newspapers, become a major celebrity in his own right and land piles of cash When thousands gather outside the cave and a feverish media circus begins to grow, Tatum smells victory. But of course things go downhill from here.Wilder has always been a master of tone and he continues that trend here. The film starts very funny in a dark, sadistic sort of way, but Wilder slowly lets the humor drain from the proceedings.Wilder often considered Ace in the Hole to be his greatest film and he'll get no argument from me. As of this writing, I can think of few films that are as timely and relevant as this one. It feels fresh and contemporary, and not dated in the least.

Jurassic Park shattered the box-office money record by over 150 million dollars. It has since been passed nine times, but truly was one of the great cinematic events in history. Director Steven Spielberg's movie employed more realistic and intricate animatronics than any previously seen. Its Computer Generated Images (CGI) revolutionized special effects. The T-1000 from the second Terminator film had been the crowing achievement in visual effects to that point; Jurassic Park showed humans and technological illusions interacting in ways far exceeding anything that came before. If it were released as is, those images might earn Oscar Nominations today. A sequel to such a groundbreaking and competently made film comes with titanic expectations. When The Lost World is judged by its own merits, a lot of good comes to the surface. It does not match its predecessor, nor does it need to for satisfying entertainment.Sam Neill and Laura Dern do not return for the sequel. Thankfully, Jeff Goldblum does. Golblum's Dr. Malcolm lightened Jurassic Park with his pithy summaries of the various situations. Some were sarcastic; others told the truth in an amusing way. Goldblum knows the correct approach for a man completely unaware the humor inherent in his words. The sequel misses the characters who do not return, but Malcolm is indispensable. Jurassic Park 3 proves how mundane Neill's Dr. Grant is without Goldblum around.Richard Attenborough is the only other actor to return. Again he plays John Hammond, the mastermind behind the dinosaur amusement park. Attenborough has the same exuberance and ready smile as before. He is more reserved since Hammond is older and not as healthy. He was 73 when the movie was filmed, but his performance makes Hammond seem ten years younger.Hammond grew Jurassic Park's dinosaurs on another island. One day, a wealthy couple stops on the island and some small dinosaurs injure their daughter (Camilla Belle, who has had some lead roles since). Hammond's nephew Peter (Arliss Howard) uses the incident to dissolve his uncle's power. Hammond knows that Peter will pillage the park, so he summons Malcolm to request his presence on an observation team. Ian bluntly refuses, but a new development changes his mind. Meanwhile, Peter prepares his own team for a trip with less noble aims.Since all but three characters know what creatures are on the island, the wonder and amazement factor is mostly absent. Instead, the movie generates pathos for the dinosaurs. A cruel hunter (Pete Postlethwaite) breaks an infant T-Rex' leg and ties him to the ground. The animal's wails of pain and cries for his parents tug on the heartstrings of anybody who has a four-legged pet. The movie includes an extended scene of people mistreating frightened animals who wish them no harm. Even Dr. Malcolm, who plans to kill any dinosaur at the first sign of trouble, has moral issues with that behavior. When two other members of the observation team (Julianne Moore and Vince Vaughn) make a critical error, the situation becomes far more dangerous.I will not comment on the ending except to say that it is a puzzling decision by the writers. It left many people scratching their heads. The Lost World did not approach the box office total of its predecessor as sequels to popular movies typically do. The final half hour may have generated some poor word of mouth or discouraged repeat business. In any case, it is unnecessary.It would have been better to prolong the main portion, which contains more carnage than the first movie. The two best scenes are the cliffhanger problem and the final confrontation with the raptors. The quality of the raptor scene meets Steven Spielberg standards. It is the cliffhanger, however, that equals anything the first movie offers. Young directors should observe how Spielberg films them. He uses many extended shots to best demonstrate the relative locations and actions of the characters. He prefers long, moving shots to quick editing. Goldblum provides the lightness with his comments. He has the most fun during Malcolm's radio conversation with an unpleasant lady.
