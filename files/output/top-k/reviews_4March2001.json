Altough the scenes that I had watched particularly between Rush and Blanchett struck me as really good. My descision to not watch the film was based in my truly dislike of the costume film genre, wich I find 98% of the movies boring and uninteristing, disguised by costumes and set decorations as true art. But I shall also comment that I have seen very good period films like Quills to mention a recent example, that have a story and are interesting in all their aspects wether they are based on historical facts or fictional,so I always try to leave a tiny door open to see some period films.I recently saw Cate Blanchett in The Gift and was amazed at her performance. I saw her before in supporting roles in Talented Mr. Ripleyand Pushing Tin, and tought she was great. So I decided to rent some of her other films to look at her work. I rent An Ideal Husband and this film,the oscar nominee Elizabeth. Blanchett was robbed the academy award for her performance. She is a delight, a powerful force. Even if she is not in the screen, you FEEL her presence She has the demanding task of portraying Elizabeth I through her many changes, from a young naive girl learning to be a queen to a secure woman in total charge of a country. Through all of the changes Blanchett is completely believable. Apart from her perfect english accent(she is australian)and body language, she uses in her performance something that is almost dissapeared in film acting today. Her face, through her face she conveys so many emotions from sweetness to anguish and really express the feelings of Elizabeth. There is a point in her performance that only by seeing her face, you KNEW what Elizabeth, the Virgin Queen was feeling at that moment. In a year that also saw nominations to Emily Watson and Fernanda Montenegro for their powerful performances. Is was Blanchett who should have taken the statuette insetead of Gwyneth Paltrow for her insipid performance (but she was the only hollywood actress of the lot,so the academy again kept the award between their own comunnity)Geoffrey Rush was nominated in supporting actor category for Shakespeare in Love but is in Elizabeth that he shines as  Elizabeth´s slightly malicious principal advisor. Joseph Fiennes, the lead man in Shakespeareis also better here as Robert Dudley, Elizabeth´s lover Apart from those performances the movie is really, really good. Shekar Kapur did a great directing job, using close ups and monologues to explore more the internal lives of the caracters, the cinematography is a very interesting palette of dark and bright colors. The story does take some historic liberties, but in compensation reveals the internal battles and conflicts of it´s principal character more profoundly that any historic film will do. But the film becomes weak in it´s last half hour. It seems like Kapur and crew became tired in the making of the film and decided to give it a rapid ending without any construction and even coherence. Kapuer direction, so interesting and distinctive in the first hour and half becomes conventional and melodramatic and nearly ruins the picture.On the other hand that unconventional half of the picture may have been why Elizabeth lost all the 7 academy awards nomination it had,deserving much of them (certainly along with The Thin Red Line it was the best picture in that year´s best picture race)and going instead with the conventional costume picture that Shakespeare was, however the only unforgivable thing about the academy and Elizabeth is Paltrow winning over Blanchett (I would keep repeating that, im offended!!)  Is for that weakness in the conclusion of the film that I rate Elizabetha 9, if the movie would have kept it´s style, It would had become one of my favorite costume films of all time. Still I strongly reccomend it for the first 90 minutes and the stunning work of Blanchett.

Starring Chow Yun-Fat, Michelle Yeoh, Zhang Ziyi, Chang Chen, Cheng Pei-pei.I don't have reason to hide that I was worried about what I would think of CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON. I was never a fan of martial-arts movies. The story, the characters and the situations are laughable and, even recognizing that Bruce Lee was a great personality, I just don't care about his movies. It never occurred to me that I could watch a Jackie Chan flick some day, but I thought the fight sequences in THE MATRIX and CHARLIE'S ANGELS were very cool. I wasn't a big fan of Ang Lee's pictures either. THE WEDDING BANQUET and EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN were fine, SENSE AND SENSIBILITY was lovely, but THE ICE STORM was quite disappointing for me and I didn't watch RIDE WITH THE DEVIL because it didn't interest me to see a Civil War art-house starring Tobey Maguire and Jewel. However, CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON received some of the best reviews of the year worldwide, won 2 Golden Globes in January and is nominated to 10 Oscar, including best picture, best director and best film in a foreign language. That changed my view and I started to wait anxiously for it. I saw it yesterday and... Wow! Wow! Wow!The story told in CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON brings nothing new, but what makes the difference is the way it is told. Ang Lee returns to his roots and pays homage to the old Chinese Wuxia movies, with the story of two women who try to find their place in the 19th century China. Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) is a brave woman and an excellent fighter, who never confessed her love to fellow friend Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat). He has just come back from his long training and now he wants to rest for some reason. He asks Shu Lien to give his sword, Green Destiny, to an old man as a gift. For that, she makes a long journey to his house, where she meets Jen Yu (Zhang Ziyi), a young woman, daughter of an aristocrat, who is just about to marry a man she doesn't love. At night, a masked thief steals the sword and that act is what will make all the characters evaluate their strength and their inside feelings.If Ang Lee doesn't win the best director award, I'll be very very angry. First of all, he has made one of the most visually gorgeous and rich films of the last years and maybe of all times. He literally takes us to another world, where you have to leave logic at the door. During two hours, you become so involved in what's happening on the screen that you forget what time of the day it is. If I were him, I would never stop working with the same cinematographer, writer, composer, set decorator, costume designer, editor and cast. The cinematography is triumphant the colors are rich but never exaggerated, the light and the dark are always on the right place. The music is just wonderful. I loved it! The sets are terrific and so are the costumes, and the editing helps to make the fight sequences even better than they are (we'll get to them in a minute). This is the kind of film made to fit perfectly the big screen. It's really beautiful, wonderful, marvelous, gorgeous! Probably the most well made film of the year. All that with a 15 million dollar budget!!!!!It's not every film, especially a martial-arts one, that has such a complex character development. We can identify with all their dramas and choices, especially Jen Yu, a young woman who wants to run away from conventions and stay with her beloved Lo, but first of all she has to choose what side she should stay with Li Mu Bai and Shu Lien, who will take her to a training, or with Jade Fox, a mean woman who has killed Li Mu Bai's master and is target of other people's revenge, but has been Jen's master, even if she doesn't know the real meaning of the manual, a thing that Jen is able to understand. In fact, she is her own master and also an amazingly determined person. The relationship between Shu Lien and Li Mu Bai is also very well portrayed and even the supporting characters, as a detective who seeks for revenge against Jade Fox, have their place. This story has wonderful messages about courage, determination, destiny, love and strength. `Crouching tiger, hidden dragon' is a Chinese proverb about hiding your forces, what all the characters do. The screenplay explores many situations and there's even place for some slight humor. By the way, there isn't an isolated genre the film is part of adventure, romance, fantasy, drama, action, there's all.CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON didn't receive any Oscar nominations for acting, but it is top notch. The Mandarin language sounds like poetry when said by Michelle Yeoh, Chow Yun-Fat and Zhang Ziyi. Believe me, it's never hard to follow- it's delightful. Michelle gives us a quiet, powerful performance as Shu Lien. Chow Yun-Fat proves once again that he is excellent, as Li Mu Bai. But Zhang Ziyi is the best- she is very pretty and acts with security and strength, just like a veteran.Now we finally get to the already famous fight sequences that break the law of gravity. I confess that I found it to be very strange the first time I heard about, but in the film it is breath-taking. If there's someone in your session who laughs when the characters fight kung-fu in the air, just ignore this person because he\/she doesn't know what is cinema. The same way there are films that portray life just like it is, as Robert Altman's masterpiece NASHVILLE, there are fantasy films where logic is left at the door. It's more than impressive, it's jaw-dropping when you see what they could do using only wires. The two women running on the roof, Jen and Li Mu Bai walking on the water and especially the same two fighting on the bamboo forest- the most beautiful and memorable scene of 2000. I absolutely adored them!CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON will stay as Ang Lee's masterpiece. I think I couldn't describe how wonderful it is, but if you have seen it you know what I'm talking about. If you haven't, don't think twice leave the logic at the door and see it on the big screen. Don't worry if it doesn't win many Oscar. GLADIATOR will win best picture, but CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON is much better. It will recover many people's faith in the art of cinema. And prepare yourself for one of the most poetic endings you will have seen.

She is an emotional prodigy. Was just right in `The Professional,' and really shined in `Beautiful Girls,' which was her best. (Funny, it was Uma Thurman's best too.) But since then, she has been stymied by a reserve. She is smart enough to look like she is a fine actor, without committing her soul. This still places her high on the roster, but well below say Kate Winslet or Cate Capshaw. This film and the Walmart mom bit that followed were disappointing in terms of the growing maturity we expect. The `Star Wars' episodes could further mar her skills, with all that distracting bumf.Thora Birch has an uncredited small role here, where she outacts Natalie! Just because she was there and not thinking but acting. Thora was making `American Beauty' at this time I think, which is roughly the same story with several enriching folds and a more cinematic vision.Shawn Hatosy also has a small role. He is someone to watch, to judge not from the vapid `Providence' but from the pretty engaging `Sympatico.'Pretty bad when everyone involved in a project has very much better work elsewhere.

Since that was the only reason, they played safe with everything else, in particular employing a formulaic script. I can imagine the pitch `Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore' meets `Mermaids' meets `Terms of Endearment,' (which is mentioned in the action) but without the edge of any.Wang does not equal Woo + Ang; everything is rote with him here, and too much. He focuses on faces, which is fine with these faces, but forgets the rest of the world. What's up? His last film was the exciting `Chinese Box.' Complex. Nuanced, Environmental. Guess he got burned on that project so decided to go plain.Sarandon seems distracted here, and I suppose it is because the character isn't very real. Her acting style is old school method, where you have to find the real person and then let her behave. There is no real person here, only a series of neurotic episodes.Which brings us to Portman.

Jackson, Robin Wright Penn, Spencer Treat Clark.WARNING THIS COMMENT CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS1999 was an unforgettable year for M. Night Shyamalan. A film called THE SIXTH SENSE came unnoticed, with no expectations, and suddenly became not only the second most successful picture of that year (the first was, of course, THE PHANTOM MENACE), but also one of the most successful films of all times, for the surprise of many people, especially Shyamalan. In 2000 another surprise came THE SIXTH SENSE received 5 Oscar nominations, including best picture and best director. Surprises were part of this film indeed, especially the disturbing, amazing twist in the end, that many of us will never forget. Shyamalan had much to celebrate, but soon he was involved with another project UNBREAKABLE, with THE SIXTH SENSE star Bruce Willis. It became one of the most expected films of 2000 and when it was released... many people that were expecting SIXTH SENSE- PART II got disappointed with the result, because they wanted to see a film even better than the first and a twist even more surprising, and what they got was something very different.In fact, there are some similarities between UNBREAKABLE and THE SIXTH SENSE the style, the cinematography, the unusual camera angles, the same star, the presence of a boy and the aura of a mystery to be solved. But, even with some supernatural stuff, there are no ghosts that don't know they are dead nor a child who sees dead people in UNBREAKABLE. It tries -and succeeds- to mix two different genres the cinema and the comic books, in an unusual and melancholic story of a super hero.David Dunn (Willis) is the only person to survive in a terrible train accident. He didn't even had a scratch, what puzzles the doctors and the families of the dead, but he let it pass and continues living his life, until he receives a note asking what was the last time he got sick. This note takes him to a weird man called Elijah Price (Jackson), a comic books fan and collector, who makes David see the truth around him. As a mystery film, UNBREAKABLE is terrific. Some events of the past and some tiny details serve as clues that make David finds out, little by little, that he is a super hero, a kind of unbreakable man whose cryptonite is... water, and he has a mission with the society. That helps him to find love in his family again, but some things are not very well explained yet.UNBREAKABLE is a puzzle, but not exactly the kind of puzzle THE SIXTH SENSE was. In the 1999 film the pieces took right to the end. Here the pieces slowly take to a conclusion, but there's still something hidden, what will be shown in the last scene. It's like a jigsaw that you're almost completing, but when you're about to join the last pieces you realize that a single piece is missing. The end was maybe the exact point of disagreement in this movie some people thought it was great, but the majority thought it almost spoiled the whole thing. I saw the film in January and I still think it was an abrupt, but very coherent conclusion. There's no way to say what I want without spoiling the end, so as you've already been warned, here it goes UNBREAKABLE has all the elements of a good comic book, so it might have a real villain. As Jackson's character say, the hero and the villain begin as friends many times and suddenly become enemies because of an ambiguous act of the latter. Here we have David Dunn and Elijah Price as two uncommon people, one being just the opposite of the other. The first thinks he is being helped by the latter to know the truth about himself. Well, he is, but not in the correct way. Price\/Glass was just trying to find the exact opposite of him, but for that he had to... kill people, create disasters of epic proportions. He suffered all his life with his condition but Dunn\/Raincoat can't understand that and becomes his #1 enemy. The condition of hero\/villain, bad\/ugly is so old as the world, and UNBREAKABLE portrays it extremely well. As in THE SIXTH SENSE, the film wouldn't be complete without the ending twist. It is a bit abrupt indeed, but not arbitrary.UNBREAKABLE begins as a quite cold film, but it started to stay with me as the charade started to make sense. Maybe this was what M. Night Shyamalan wanted, and he succeeds in building a beautiful piece of mystery. The cinematography is terrific and the unusual camera angles make justice to masterpieces like PSYCHO. The direction is great and the writing improves with time. If Bruce Willis was overshadowed by Haley Joel Osment in THE SIXTH SENSE, here he has place to show that he is a good actor, not a great one. The best performances come from Samuel L. Jackson (haunting) and the very talented Robin Wright Penn. Spencer Treat Clark isn't nearly as good as Osment, but he has some future. By the way, he takes part in the only out of place scene in the movie when he points a gun to Willis- a scene that lacks credibility.UNBREAKABLE is not a masterpiece, but it is a great film. It didn't deserve so many bland reviews and fans of THE SIXTH SENSE shouldn't be so disappointed. Shyamalan's work is original, intense, surprising, suspenseful and even poetic and sweet at times. It was one of the few movies in 2000 that deserved to be seen on the big screen. ","genre":null},{"date":"4 March 2001","score":"","review":"  UNBREAKABLE (2000) ***1\/2 Directed by M.

The supporting cast is great aswell, there is not a soul that doesn't contribute to the perfection of it all. Realism is neither what they were really going for nor what makes the movie. The language and vocabulary of these kids is phenominal, words like, Vapid, Pensive, Hanus, Tempestuous, Miscreants. There are lots of words like these throughout the movie. It is the thing that does the most to enable adult enjoyment.For once they avoided the school bully theme, the bad guy in this is just a model who the chicks like and some of the guys hang with and alot of others just realise he is a fool. The recessive geek role is this time given alot more credibility, he is given the majority of the genuinely witty one liners and finds a soul mate for himself, instead of them just making it a joke that he stays a joke. There are a few parts you can really cheer in, you have to watch it to appreciate them. There is truly never a dull moment.The best quote of the whole movie would have to be it's just an excuse for all the nerds at our school to rub up against each other to distract themselves from the pathetic emptiness of thier meaningless consumer driven lives that pretty much sums up the purpose of teen parties these days. For once you actually identify with the bitch role in this, both she and the guy that is falsely pursuing her take a backward step, usually when it comes time for the leading man to apolagise for his deceit you really cant believe him after they have focused for so long on his efforts, this time for some reason you do, it fits straight into the story. There is another half to that situation here aswell but I wont disclose, it is probably the best bit of the movie.And the last major point is that this time the father character is a hell of alot stronger than before, if that had been weak so would the rest of the movie have been, but he is not. He has a reason for being there and you identify with him aswell. It is clear to see they were making the characters all strong in thier own right and stronger than the actual story.To sum it all up the characters, story and acting are all perfect, adults can enjoy this one aswell, also because the main relationships are more stable and adult than the unpredictability of true teenage relationships, if they can be called such.

I thought, another teenagers flick where the hottest guy in school has to appreciate a lesser unpopular chick etc etc etc. Since seeing it it has enterred my all time favourites list. Any old somebody can take the formula of The Taming of the Shrue and put it into a school yard, and any old somebody can avoid cle she's in the finer details, coming up with decent alternatives is the hard part, whatever they did here works like clockwork. I would easily give it the best teen flick mantle.Firstly, the acting is perfect, the roles are not overly demanding but Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger play this to perfection. The supporting cast is great aswell, there is not a soul that doesn't contribute to the perfection of it all. Realism is neither what they were really going for nor what makes the movie. The language and vocabulary of these kids is phenominal, words like, Vapid, Pensive, Hanus, Tempestuous, Miscreants. There are lots of words like these throughout the movie. It is the thing that does the most to enable adult enjoyment.For once they avoided the school bully theme, the bad guy in this is just a model who the chicks like and some of the guys hang with and alot of others just realise he is a fool. The recessive geek role is this time given alot more credibility, he is given the majority of the genuinely witty one liners and finds a soul mate for himself, instead of them just making it a joke that he stays a joke. There are a few parts you can really cheer in, you have to watch it to appreciate them. There is truly never a dull moment.The best quote of the whole movie would have to be it's just an excuse for all the nerds at our school to rub up against each other to distract themselves from the pathetic emptiness of thier meaningless consumer driven lives that pretty much sums up the purpose of teen parties these days. For once you actually identify with the bitch role in this, both she and the guy that is falsely pursuing her take a backward step, usually when it comes time for the leading man to apolagise for his deceit you really cant believe him after they have focused for so long on his efforts, this time for some reason you do, it fits straight into the story. There is another half to that situation here aswell but I wont disclose, it is probably the best bit of the movie.And the last major point is that this time the father character is a hell of alot stronger than before, if that had been weak so would the rest of the movie have been, but he is not. He has a reason for being there and you identify with him aswell. It is clear to see they were making the characters all strong in thier own right and stronger than the actual story.To sum it all up the characters, story and acting are all perfect, adults can enjoy this one aswell, also because the main relationships are more stable and adult than the unpredictability of true teenage relationships, if they can be called such. So here is the count.Production Values 2\/2, Acting 2\/2, Quality and Meaning 1.5\/2, Screenplay 2\/2, Originality 1\/2Anyone can get something from this movie and most can get alot. This is a must.

Not only is this a masterfully directed suspense chiller, it actually set standards by which all fright films since have been measured.  The cinema has produced some great scores, but Bernard Herrmann's music is incredibly enhancing and simply unforgettable, one of the best ever (and it did not even get an Oscar nomination for Best Score). The more I watch Psycho, the more I prefer the first half, with its sense of dread and a fascinatingly cool Janet Leigh (Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress). Hitchcock, of course, never won the Best Director Oscar, but was nominated for Psycho, one of 1960's biggest box-office hits.  Shockingly, Anthony Perkins, in a career-making role and one of the most famous performances in screen history, failed to win a Best Actor nomination -- probably because the performance was too edgy and disturbing (which is what made it great).

But how wrong he was...Psycho went on to become the highest grossing black and white film of all time, (In a time when colour films were already popular) the highest grossing horror film of all time and the highest grossing Alfred Hitchcock film of all time. The film made Anthony Perkins a superstar, but sadly, this was more harming to his career than uplifting, as the movie-going public always have (and always will) only seen him as Norman Bates, and nobody else. This was concurred as Perkins never again made a film of real value, but in 1983 Psycho 2 was a huge hit for Universal Pictures. Janet Leigh on the other hand, went on to make a few well done done films in her respect.About the film Anthony Perkins' performance as the stuttering Norman Bates is in my opinion the greatest film performance of all time. His nervous, boyish acting style brings a simple charm to the character, and he even succeeds in creating a sympathetic approach from the public. He even succeeds in hiding his character's madness, and couldn't do it better. Janet Leigh is perfect as the thief, and you even have more sympathy for Norman as for Marion. The rest of the cast, (John Gavin - Sam Loomis; Vera Miles - Lila Crane; Martin Balsam - Milton Arbogast and John McIntire's Sheriff Chambers) are all as good as it gets, but no one matches Anthony Perkins performance. Sorry to say, but John Gavin is miscast. He looks too gentle, too moral to ever cheat on his wife. This is the only bad thing about this cinema classic.The classic shower scene not only created a single shock, but a film memory to haunt for generations to come. Alfred Hitchcock filmed this scene with great care and delicacy. You can sense this with the fact that not a finger is out of place, and even Janet Leigh still showers in fear.I was disgusted when I learned that Perkins wasn't even nominated for an Academy Award, because he should have won it! He wasn't nominated for ANY prize of ANY kind, and to crown it all, Janet Leigh was nominated for an Oscar and won a Golden Globe. Well deserved, I should think, but Perkins was the real reason that the film reached such success, not Leigh, nor Hitchcock.I salute both Anthony Perkins and sir Alfred Hitchcock for what they've done for film history, and for the fact that there will be only one Tony Perkins, and one Alfred Hitchcock.

Okay, let me start with thisThis movie isn't bad.  But it isn't genius.  It is not one of the best movies of all time.Problem Number 1 characterization.  This is pretty standard if you ask me. These are basic characters that become more boring as the movie moves on. Many characters, like Andy Garcia, just seem to be there.  We never really learn about him.  I'll address a bigger character problem later.Problem Number 2 the whole movie is a bit screwed up in awkward ways. Example There is a scene where Malone and Ness are busting a bootleg outfit.  This should be a tense moment.  A bunch of cops are about to break in on a bunch of criminals.  But, the music!  The music that is playing is this triumphic, victory music, EVEN BEFORE THEY EVER ENTER THE WHEREHOUSE! I thought that it would have made much more sense to have a tenser moment with tenser music.Problem Number 3 Robert De Niro.  He's supposed to be the villain, the antagonist.  But how long is he actually in this movie?  It couldn't be any longer than 5 minutes.  He is wasted in this movie.Finally, Problem Number 4 Is it just me or is Sean Connery over praised in this movie?  I know, I know; everyone praises him for his work in this movie.  I know he won the Oscar that year for this.  But does anyone really care about Oscars?  Does Saving Private Ryan ring any bells?  I am not calling his performance bad; I love Sean Connery.  He's the one, true BOND! The man is one of my favorite actors!  But people over praise him for this movie.  His performance, while intense, lacks depth.  Not to mention his accent is a mix between Irish (his character's accent) and Scottish (his real accent).  And yes, there is a diffence.Honestly, I didn't hate this movie.  I did like it a little bit.  I really, really can't see why this movie is considered as great as it is.  There is some good, (great) stuff here.  The elevator scene and the train station scene leap to mind.  The Untouchables isn't really trying to say anything but, `Eh, here's a mob movie.  Enjoy'.  The Godfather said, `How do ya like that! POW POW POW! GENIUS!' and Goodfellas said, `You will love this movie, or we will kill you'.I will say Costner gives a great performance.  DeNiro, for what little time he has, is great too (but DeNiro is always great, so no surprise there).In conclusion, the whole movie is good.  It's worth a rent or an HBO viewing.  I'm just p****d that I bought the movie before I saw it. Everyone said it was great!  I now have a new rule never buy a movie without seeing it beforehand no matter how praised it is.  I don't regret buying it because it is enjoyable (and that opening sequence is cool), but had I seen it before I bought it, I would have gotten something else.  My basic attitude toward the movie is that it's one of those movie that comes out, you see it, you say, `Eh, I liked it', then you forget about it.  I just don't see the attraction.Tin one sentence the whole movie is about as deep as piece of paper, and just as heavy.Overall Originality 4\/10 Plot 6\/10 Memorable Scenes 9\/10 Acting 6\/10 Characters 4\/10 Interest 4\/10Overall 6\/10 (not an average) ","genre":null},{"date":"4 March 2001","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Am I the only person who found this movie a little mediocre?

But how long is he actually in this movie?  It couldn't be any longer than 5 minutes.  He is wasted in this movie.Finally, Problem Number 4 Is it just me or is Sean Connery over praised in this movie?  I know, I know; everyone praises him for his work in this movie.  I know he won the Oscar that year for this.  But does anyone really care about Oscars?  Does Saving Private Ryan ring any bells?  I am not calling his performance bad; I love Sean Connery.  He's the one, true BOND! The man is one of my favorite actors!  But people over praise him for this movie.  His performance, while intense, lacks depth.  Not to mention his accent is a mix between Irish (his character's accent) and Scottish (his real accent).  And yes, there is a diffence.Honestly, I didn't hate this movie.  I did like it a little bit.  I really, really can't see why this movie is considered as great as it is.  There is some good, (great) stuff here.  The elevator scene and the train station scene leap to mind.  The Untouchables isn't really trying to say anything but, `Eh, here's a mob movie.  Enjoy'.  The Godfather said, `How do ya like that! POW POW POW! GENIUS!' and Goodfellas said, `You will love this movie, or we will kill you'.I will say Costner gives a great performance.  DeNiro, for what little time he has, is great too (but DeNiro is always great, so no surprise there).In conclusion, the whole movie is good.  It's worth a rent or an HBO viewing.  I'm just p****d that I bought the movie before I saw it. Everyone said it was great!  I now have a new rule never buy a movie without seeing it beforehand no matter how praised it is.  I don't regret buying it because it is enjoyable (and that opening sequence is cool), but had I seen it before I bought it, I would have gotten something else.  My basic attitude toward the movie is that it's one of those movie that comes out, you see it, you say, `Eh, I liked it', then you forget about it.

Okay, let me start with thisThis movie isn't bad.  But it isn't genius.  It is not one of the best movies of all time.Problem Number 1 characterization.  This is pretty standard if you ask me. These are basic characters that become more boring as the movie moves on. Many characters, like Andy Garcia, just seem to be there.  We never really learn about him.  I'll address a bigger character problem later.Problem Number 2 the whole movie is a bit screwed up in awkward ways. Example There is a scene where Malone and Ness are busting a bootleg outfit.  This should be a tense moment.  A bunch of cops are about to break in on a bunch of criminals.  But, the music!

There are parts of the film that look like they could belong to a particularly delectable episode of `Martha Stewart Living', but if you can get past the pangs of hunger it will certainly inflict, you will find there is a lot more to this seemingly charming and simple story.The film plays in the style of all whimsical children's fairy tales, while at the same time blending in a series of very serious adult themes. It chronicles the exploits of single mother Vianne Rocher, played as usual to a wonderful effect by Juliette Binoche, and her sugary but confused 6-year-old daughter Anouk (Victoire Thivisol), who blow in on a forceful winter wind to the small rural French town of Lansquenet-sous-Tannes. There they open a small chocolate shop.  Now this seems innocent enough but the people of the town have different views.  For one the shop has been opened at the very unwelcomed time of Lent (a religious fast), during which new temptations certainly aren't invited.  Secondly the town's new residents refuse to attend the Sunday morning worship service.  Vianne soon finds herself to be the center of the town gossip and distaste, led by the mayor (Alfred Molina).  The battle heats up between allegedly pagan Vianne, and the highly conservative, stuffed-shirt townspeople.  At start it seems the Rochers are losing, but the fight soon turns as the townsfolk begin to discover the mouth-melting effects of Vianne's wonderful taste-teasing treats.Misadventure after misadventure occur as the couple come in contact with a wide array of colorful characters (just when you think he must be an extra in comes Johnny Depp), solving their problems while at the same time selling their chocolates.  The moral is left fairly open, and can be interpreted in many ways.

She rents a patisserie shop from an aged owner, Armande Voizin(Judi Dench), and quickly rehabilitates it into the chocolate shop of the title.  Her magical gifts at creating these sweet wonders and also anticipating the exact delight of each of her prospective clients comes from her own mother, a Mayan priestess with whom her father had had a doomed relationship.  Unfortunately, all of this activity takes place right at the start of Lent in this heavily Catholic town under both the political and the moral guidance of the Mayor Comte de Reynaud(Alfred Molina). The mayor is also currently occupied in the training of the newly-arrived priest so as to elevate him to his own exacting moralistic standards.The Mayor takes it as a personal affront that this young woman has opened this shop of gustatory pleasures during the Lenten period when fasting and denying yourself of all earthly pleasures is supposed to be the rule. He threatens to close her down before the end of Lent.  The few allies Vianne finds in the town include her landlady and also a battered wife, Josephine Muscat(Lena Olin).  This situation quickly develops into a crisis setting when a boatload of musical drifters headed by Roux(Johnny Depp) drop achor in the river that flows through the town.  The two non-comformists quickly link up as allies while the Mayor and his allies try to figure out how to get this new threat of the floating riff-raff back on their boat and off to the next town as soon as possible.While I am a sucker for ancient European villages and all period romances, this story didn't develop either the romance or the story to levels raised by all the Oscar hoopla.  Neither the movie nor Juliette Binoche nor Judi Dench deserved their Oscar nominations.  Binoche's's character was not fleshed out enough to allow us to get to know what really motivated her.  Furthermore, while the shop is proclaimed to be a success the exchange of money for sweets is not once shown during the movie.  My vote for an Oscar nomination would only have gone to Lena Olin for her rich portrayal of a battered wife picking herself up and starting over as Binoche's assistant chocolatier.  Rating ***(Three Stars, out of four) for a trifle that is sweet but not filling enough to serve as a full cinematic meal.

Unfortunately, all of this activity takes place right at the start of Lent in this heavily Catholic town under both the political and the moral guidance of the Mayor Comte de Reynaud(Alfred Molina). The mayor is also currently occupied in the training of the newly-arrived priest so as to elevate him to his own exacting moralistic standards.The Mayor takes it as a personal affront that this young woman has opened this shop of gustatory pleasures during the Lenten period when fasting and denying yourself of all earthly pleasures is supposed to be the rule. He threatens to close her down before the end of Lent.  The few allies Vianne finds in the town include her landlady and also a battered wife, Josephine Muscat(Lena Olin).  This situation quickly develops into a crisis setting when a boatload of musical drifters headed by Roux(Johnny Depp) drop achor in the river that flows through the town.  The two non-comformists quickly link up as allies while the Mayor and his allies try to figure out how to get this new threat of the floating riff-raff back on their boat and off to the next town as soon as possible.While I am a sucker for ancient European villages and all period romances, this story didn't develop either the romance or the story to levels raised by all the Oscar hoopla.  Neither the movie nor Juliette Binoche nor Judi Dench deserved their Oscar nominations.  Binoche's's character was not fleshed out enough to allow us to get to know what really motivated her.  Furthermore, while the shop is proclaimed to be a success the exchange of money for sweets is not once shown during the movie.  My vote for an Oscar nomination would only have gone to Lena Olin for her rich portrayal of a battered wife picking herself up and starting over as Binoche's assistant chocolatier.  Rating ***(Three Stars, out of four) for a trifle that is sweet but not filling enough to serve as a full cinematic meal.
