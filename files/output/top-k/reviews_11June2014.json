If your willing to feel the emotion in this movie and your willing to pay attention, much like the other installments in this series there are clear messages in this film. All of the movies in the Rambo series have conveyed messages about the horrors of war and this one is no different.First Blood Part III takes Rambo into Afghanistan to rescue his mentor and friend Colonel Trautmen. On an ill fated mission, Trautmen is taken hostage by Soviet forces and Rambo simply refuses to allow his friend to die. While in Afghanistan, the journey of self discovery that the character of Rambo is always on leads him to learn of the plight of the Afghan people. Surrounded by religious extremists who would wipe them all out and facing down a massive Soviet invasion, these people simply refuse to quit. They refuse to lay down and die, because of this Rambo instantly feels a connection with them and it seems Rambo has found a new war to fight, I won't go any further because it will spoil the ending of the film for you but i will say this, ignore the films detractors. First Blood Part III is as much Rambo as either of its predecessors and is a very very well made film.Excellent acting, top notch writing and direction and an excellent story help the viewer see and understand the points being made in this movie. There is some added humor that perhaps the two previous films didn't have, but those few moments of humor have a purpose and they are not at all misplaced. There's plenty of action and plenty of Rambo doing what he does best. Refusing to back down no matter the odds and refusing to quit in situations that would leave most people curled up in a ball and crying.If your a pure action movie fan or perhaps more like myself, you can see and feel more in these movies than just gunfights and explosions, either way you'll enjoy this one. For those who might not have an understanding of just how most of the Middle East became a war zone, believe it or not there are plenty of scenes in this film that can give you some insight. Even though Rambo is going in long after the battles have begun, his journey leads him to understanding the plight of the people living there and can help just about anyone else start asking questions and looking for answers.

He is spotted by bigoted sheriff Teasel (Brian Dennehy) who promptly escorts him off his turf. When the peaceful Rambo turns around and defiantly starts walking back into the town, Teasel has him arrested. Mocked, mistreated, and beaten at the police station, Rambo snaps with agonized flashbacks of Vietnam, escapes the police, and flees off to the woods where he is pursued by law officials. What they don't realize is that Rambo is a Green Beret, trained for survival and conditioned to endure pain and weather. Teasel and his men have now set Rambo off, and he wages a personal war on them that they won't believe. Rambo's old commanding officer (Richard Crenna) arrives on the scene to try and calm things before his man goes too far.This is surely one of Stallone's finest films and characters, and Sly looks his best in FIRST BLOOD. His John Rambo here is someone we can sympathize with, and his balance of calm followed by extreme self-preservation intensity is well realized. This film is smaller and more independent in feel than the sequels which came after it, and this gives it more appeal. Brian Dennehy is quite good as the hateful town sheriff whose prejudice has resulted in Rambo's wrath. Richard Crenna was a last minute substitute for Kirk Douglas (who backed out eventually), and perhaps occasionally appears a tad theatrical in his approach. The ending of the movie contains an emotionally charged speech by Stallone which is often criticized as being incomprehensible, but if you pay close attention you can decipher just about all of it. ***1\/2 out of **** ","genre":null},{"date":"11 June 2014","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" First and best of the series has former soldier John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) traveling through a small town in the hope of visiting an old army friend.

This character graph has inspired many Bollywood filmmakers (Rajkumar Hirani, Karan Johar in particular) to sketch their characters, and they have milked their stories with enough drama too. I turned upon this film after watching its Bollywood inspirations. But I wasn't looking for any (melo)drama; but subtlety, of course, which, in my opinion, this film lacked. Lacking subtlety is not a problem but hammering with details being blurted out in voice over is, for me. The overdose of voice-over narration concerns me here... it gives too much of unnecessary information which aren't contributing anything to the narrative or the plot or either emotional value, and many of the details are just repeated twice for no particular reason. And this voice-over is not even breaking the fourth wall but is a narration to strangers. He meets these strangers at a bus-stop and they happen to change from time to time, just like the visitors at the home his mom had let for. (Such symbolism, if you call it one, work.) He starts his story quoting his 'mama' (and to count how many times this Mama's boy calls her out could be one irritating game for viewers). This grown up man taking us into the flashback of his childhood never came across to me as a sympathetic one though the film's 'feather light' treatment (also embodied as a symbolism in the film) worked in many tight scenes but at the same time looked desperate in demanding emotion and sympathy from the audience. (Even that white feather hitting the screen with a whoosh at the end came across as- Oh look, we hit you so hard with such a heartwarming and light story). Maybe I'm too cynical but the character, Forrest Gump, looked to me as a dumb throughout. And over-usage of the quote An idiot is as idiot does made him look more. And I totally get that the point of the film was to look the cynical world from the prism of an unintelligent man that would make it look more simpler and a winning place, but all I'm saying that this could have been said differently, more beautifully and overwhelmingly and obviously, with some subtlety.Also I'm not asking to take away its classic status. The way the film depicts and incorporates American history, its thriving new culture and counterculture into its storytelling deserves to be acknowledged and that would have surely helped to achieve this status. The music score is indeed beautiful. But only if the director had realized that it's also about the 'sight' and not only 'sound', he would have deployed a more focused and centered cinematographer to work who would add his bit to the narrative.What worries me is that how did a film so repetitive and monotonous in its narration and tone with no powerful visual storytelling win Best Screenplay and Editing awards at the Oscars!

I would not want to be on earth because it is a lonely cauldron of drunken despair and angst from which there is little hope.That having been said, the first half of 'Made in Heaven' is loaded with a lot of color and imagination. The second half isn't. The movie stars Timothy Hutton as Mike a likable guy who dies in an accident and goes to Heaven. There he meets a guy named Emmett who is God's personal spokeman. His aunt (Maureen Stapleton) lays out some of Heaven's rules which for my book sound a little to constricting for a place that is suppose to be the ultimate paradise. Hutton can decide where he wants to live in Heaven and he chooses a log cabin in the mountains.Heaven smiles on him even more when he meets a beauty named Annie (Kelly McGillis) who's predicament is fascinating from my point of view because she hasn't been born yet (The imagination given to this Heaven is allows it to be populated with the dead as well as the yet-to-be). By this development we now understand that their time is limited. Annie will eventually have to go back to earth to be born.Mike can't stand the thought of Heaven without her. His only hope is to go back to earth and live as someone else, the catch being that they don't remember any of their heavenly adventures together and will live separate lives completely oblivious of one another.This is where the movie grinds to a halt . . .Back on earth we meet Mike who is now Milo a musician with a bone to pick with just about everyone. His existence seems to coil up in bars and self-pity. Earth is dark and dirty and we know that it won't be too much longer until Milo and Annie who is now Ally will have a meeting before the closing credits. Why make the two oblivious of each other? Doesn't that ruin the motivation? We know what will happen to them but if they aren't looking for each other where is the momentum.My biggest problem with 'Made in Heaven' is that it moves as a snails pace. Every scene in the second half seems to run on too long and with a minimum of energy. This isn't just one of the worst climaxes I've seen in the movies, it's one of the most boring. If this movie teaches me anything it's that on the whole, I'd rather be in Heaven.

This painfully average film almost manages to keep the viewers glued to their seats for decent portions of the movie.Fred The Hammer Williamson headlines what could be described as a surprisingly good cast, at least in terms of blaxploitation standards. At the ripe age of 58, Fred has shown no signs of slowing down, and I was extremely impressed at the old man's youthfulness and his flair for kicking ass. Fred is joined by industry mediumweights Pam Grier, Jim Brown, & Richard Roundtree.The movie takes place in the Hammer's hometown of Gary, Indiana. When a bunch of young, ignorant pranksters initiate a crime wave within the city, the Hammer decides to take matters into his own hands. The storyline is pretty solid, and the veteran actors turn in decent performances.On the other hand, the younger guys in this movie didn't seem to know how to act at all. They weren't very believable, and Dru Down deserves a special mention, as he may be one of the worst actors I've ever seen. This ignoramus couldn't act his way out of a paper bag. A department store mannequin would have sufficed. With that said, the dialogue is above average. This film is full of great one-liners you can playfully recite with your friends while conversing at Chuck-E-Cheese. The action scenes were rough but entertaining. There is a scene where the Hammer round-house kicks a guy to the face, which causes the victim to conveniently land on a randomly placed mattress.At times, this movie comes off like it was produced by some Mickey Mouse operation based out of the Cayman Islands. We're not dealing with a cinematic masterpiece here, folks. Nevertheless, this film will suffice for a day in order to cure boredom. However, if you're a fan of the Hammer, or blaxploitation films, or hilarious fight scenes, then you'll enjoy this movie.

The original Vincent Price movie was from 1958 and is something of a cult classic. It has some camp value certainly but mostly it worked because it had an interesting premise that was executed well. David Cronenberg's remake retained the basic idea but updated it with more complex ideas and, of course, ground-breaking special effects. In a sense, The Fly was the last pure horror film that Cronenberg ever made, despite some of his subsequent movies certainly having elements of the genre. As such it represents the final entry in a truly brilliant series of sci-fi horror feature films that began with Shivers in 1975. It's probably fair to say that The Fly is his most mature work of that sequence, in the sense of his screenplay being strong, with the production values and actors being good enough to carry it off consistently well. But that's not to say it's his best work from the period, I have even more of a fondness for his rougher earlier films and would arguably consider Videodrome to be his master-work. But this is all relative really, as The Fly remains a fantastic work and one of the very best horror or sci-fi films from the 80's.The story focuses for the most part on a research scientist called Seth Brundle and science magazine reporter. He is a reclusive intellectual who has developed telepods which can transport matter through space, while she wishes to report on it. They form a relationship which complicates matters resulting in Brundle deciding to go through his teleportation device himself one night. Unfortunately for him he unknowingly is sharing the telepod with an ordinary harmless house fly&#x85;In these days of ten-a-penny remakes and reboots, it is especially refreshing to look back on a new version of an old film that updated it in ways that made it seem necessary that it was remade. Cronenberg had shown in his previous horror films that he was a director full of original thought, so it's not really surprising that he took the ingredients from the original movie and remodelled them into one of his unique body-horror flicks. The old movie was essentially a creature feature with a difference, in that the monster was not a marauding menace but a tragic being. In this way it recalled Frankenstein, with its sympathetic monster but with the added angle that the scientist responsible becomes the monster\/victim himself. Cronenberg retains this idea but has the scientist fuse with the fly at a molecular, genetic level; meaning that a new creature entirely, emerges. In this way Brundle's metamorphosis into the Brundlefly is more gradual beginning with small things such as excessive sugar intake, moving on to extreme strength and resulting in physical transformation. The effects work here is exemplary and Oscar winning; in fact, the man responsible Chris Walas was given director duties for the very decent sequel, The Fly II.What really separates this film with Cronenberg's earlier ones is that it's emotionally resonant with sympathetic characters. Its plot boils down to an unorthodox love story of sorts. The way in which it has such a strong and realistic emotional undercurrent without sacrificing any of the gruesome and imaginative sci-fi horror aspects is what makes it so successful and relatively unusual in the genre. It's helped rather a lot by the acting contributions of Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis who both put in strong performances; Goldblum in particular has never been better than here. Ultimately, The Fly remains a definitive example of how to intelligently remake a beloved old movie &#x96; keep it the same, while making it different &#x96; it's a lot harder than it seems!

The last movie before the unfortunate death (accident) of the fine artist. A fine actor who bagged two Oscar nominations after his demise. In this film, James's voice was dubbed by his friend in number of scenes after his death. The movie is huge in length spans three hours long and an era of over 30 years from the main character's (Jordon Benedict) love to Maryland farm's daughter, his rivalry with a cowboy on his return to Texas (homeland), story of his children and grandchildren. The movie convincingly covers two generation of Benedict's family.The direction is top class. First to direct a three-hour long movie is Herculean. The Oscar has recognized and awarded the director for this work. The guild and photo-play members also had their awards for the movie. The movie is adapted from a novel with the same name. The characterization were screen-played deeply with lot of ideas that makes the viewers remember the dirty-minds on racism in that period of time in Texas. For one instance, both the lead characters Rink and Bick are prejudiced against the Mexicans, but Rink is too poor at the start of the movie so he doesn't show it. Instead after becoming a businessman he displays in much cruel way. William C. Mellor's photography was exquisite in every way throughout the two generations in the story.In my opinion, Giant must be considered along with epics like Lawrence of Arabia, Gone with the wind, Benhur etc that made it to the top 250 in IMDb. There were few minor flaws that I could not fail to notice, which included Liz Taylor's acting that dragged the movie. She could've done way better to one of the characters in the movie that carried racial tolerance(Leslie). The next flaw is by the make-up department esp. when the characters got old they don't convince the audience. It could be true that the movie is too old to comment mistakes on makeovers, so am not treating it as one.My final verdict  If you're a fan of old movies that this is one to watch as it is pacey (not too slow). Children can view this as it is free from ratings.

The villains are stupid idjit rednecks that I found to be annoying and harmless as kittens. The main character of the second half only has about ten lines in the first half, I didn't even know here name for the first 45 minutes. The only character that I cared about, the guy in the wheelchair, the only character where the filmmakers showed any subsidence is killed off so fast he may just have been a red shirt. I laughed out loud so many times during this movie, at how idiotic and silly that it seemed to me, that this is just not horror. It only gets scares from gore and revulsion. That is not good horror to me, that is a cheep out. Plus Leatherface, chasing a girl with a horrible ineffective weapon, that they show is horribly ineffective in the movie, for that matter. And another thing I could not get over about this movie is that when Leatherface is chain sawing this door (very slowly) that they showed less than a minute ago was unlocked. I know he is not bright, like a giant man child, but I assume he could try to open a door. The ending is absolutely, unbelievably a clusterfug. The entire soundtrack is just this girl screaming. Nothing truly scary, creepy or terrifying is happening, the idjit villains are just being idjits, and the noise is just unbearably loud. There is no complexity, no plot, nothing. They got a few simple scares in the beginning, very simple scares that directors and writers use only to get people to stay. During one scene the blonde, I forgot her name, Sam I think, is getting into a fight. She is obviously overpowered. There is no suspense, no nothing; just some bigger, stronger guy tying her up. He doesn't even hit her on the screen, and the sound the hits make is a very generic sound bit. The night chase scene is really where it disintegrated into a mess. For am I to be scared with an annoying as hell soundtrack, and a killer with no stealth and an ineffective weapon, plus a girl who I thought was only there to be a pretty face. When they literally introduce the villains in the beginning of the film she doesn't even talk. She does nothing, just has a but shot of her getting a Coke. The walkers in The Walking Dead (and I really don't like that show) are more scary than Leatherface. They show up out of nowhere with unnerving stealth at any time, and don't stop until disposed of, but Leatherface is a big, bumbling simpleton. I did not enjoy or like this movie, plain and simple. Horror should be about your fears. About the other among us (The Thing 1982), the very wrong and alien (Alien 1979), and good old unadulterated evil and sadism (Hellraiser 1987). This may have been original at its time, but in the end it is uncomplex, gory exploitation. No exploration of your feelings of anxiety or dread, just gore-porn. I have seen crap (Movie 43, I hate you), and this is not crap. So I give it a good four stars. Not one of the best, but not terrible.

Ever since the day I first watched the film, it has been one of my favorite movies. The idea of RoboCop isn't particularly new, many movies, comic books, pulp magazines, short stories, and TV shows, have had more or less the same plot. However RoboCop takes it in a new direction. The plot is this Things have gone to hell in Detroit, and a mega-corporation known as Omni Consumer Products or O.C.P., has taken control. Crime runs rampant all over the city, and one of the head members of O.C.P., must somehow find a solution to this problem. We then meet the main character Officer Alex Murphy, who has just transferred to the roughest part of the city. Murphy and his new partner Officer Anne Lewis, hear of a bank robbery that was committed by a local street gang. Murphy and Lewis pursue them to their hideout. The two police officers get separated, and Murphy is then cornered by the gang members and brutally shot to death. Sometime later, Murphy is resurrected by O.C.P. as the crime fighting cyborg, RoboCop! At first, Murphy has no knowledge or recollection of his life or of his family, but slowly his memories return, and RoboCop\/Murphy must rediscover his humanity and seek vengeance for his brutal murder. RoboCop not only has stellar acting, outstanding special effects, but also an excellent and compelling story. This film has one of the most memorable scores, and a brilliant use of satire with its clever commercials.

Another factor that, the film's release was supposed to coincide with the first ever launch of the NASA space shuttle, but this unfortunately didn't occur until later. Being the 11th spy film in the James Bond movie series. The movie was directed by Lewis Gilbert, whom directed the last two previous James Bond films before this. You Only Live Twice (1967) and The Spy Who Loved Me (1977). In the movie, James Bond played by Roger Moore for the fourth time, investigates the theft of a space shuttle, leading him to Hugo Draxs (Michael Lonsdale), the owner of the shuttle's manufacturing firm who is holding an evil secret plan to wipe out world population, and recreate humanity in his own image. Along with scientist Dr. Holly Goodhead (Lois Chiles), Bond must find a way to prevent Draxs from releasing this terrorism plot onto the world. For a movie that supposed to be all about space. The movie only has the last 30 minutes in space. The trailer say that the film will deliver the moon, but it's doesn't. It's nowhere near the moon. The movie Sci-Fi element is so out there, you can toss logic out of the window. Seriously, don't try solving the plot holes, from Space Marines, to how Drax got a Space Station. The movie had unrealistic survival Deus ex machine tone in its writing. Even when the movie is grounded on Earth. It's somewhat had silly action with gondola converting into hovercrafts, oddly done snake battles, and really bad ninjas. You don't see much gunplay, in this movie due to Roger Moore's distaste in guns. Still, there were some great scenes, like the sky cable cart scene and the G-Force stimulator. Most of all, the movie has one of the best James Bond opening stunt scenes ever with two men freefalling fighting over a parachute. The only problem is how cartoony, it got toward the end, mostly with metal teeth giant, Jaws (Richard Kiel) looking like an idiot Wile E. Coyote. It get worst with the big man when he fall in love, half way through the film. The stuff with Jaws and his girl is just awful. It's made cheesier with Tchaikovsky's Romeo and Juliet theme. It's the ultimate in bloated. The reason, why for this big change from a great menacing henchman to goofy big guy was due to children writing to the director, wanting to make Jaws into a good guy. In my opinion, that was a really dumb idea to have the character return from 1977's Spy Who Love me only to murder his badass appeal even more. The movie is beautiful shot. I love the locations in the film, ranging from Rio De Janeiro, Brazil, to Venice, Italy. There were some really good intense moments, such as Corrine Dufour (Corinne Cléry) being hunted by dogs chase that was beautiful haunting shot. The movie humor is more of a hit than miss for me. Bond on the quail hunt was a bit fun to watch. Roger Moore is alright in the role. Moore's Bond is a sociopathic jester; while author Ian Fleming's Bond is a shell-shocked veteran with an alcohol problem. When it comes to Lois Chiles, frankly, I just found her to be boring, as both a character and actress. With a name like 'Goodhead', you would think, she would stand out more. In my opinion, she's one of my least favorite Bond's girls. This movie was the final Bond film to feature Bernard Lee as M; he died after this movie. Drax comes out as a typical James Bond villain with over the top evil plan. It's pretty much, the same plot of the previous film. Drax's background as a Nazi party member is completely absent from the movie version. The movie might share the same title as the novel, somewhat similar plot and few characters, but for the most part, the two are nearly different. In the book, there wasn't no Dr. Holly Goodhead, but Gala Brand who share a few common characteristics. Most of the character ideals for Gala Brand would be used later in other James Bond's films, such as 2002's Die another Day. Also, worth noting is that Jaws wasn't a character in the novel. He appear extensively throughout the movie. The biggest different from the book is none of the action in the novel occurs in space. In fact, none of the science-fiction elements of the movie are based on situations described in the novel. The title song was sung by Shirley Bassey, the third and last time she did so in the Bond series after doing 1964's Goldfinger & 1971's Diamonds Are Forever. The lyrics sucks, and the music isn't the best. There are some clever hints to other films such as the tune of Steven Spielberg 1977's Close Encounters of the Third Kind. The movie does have some bad editing such it was rushed into production. There is a really bad lazy double take pigeon in the film, that a bit distracting. The special effects were mediocre. It can't help seeing the awkwardly intercuts with blue screen in certain scenes. The budget for Moonraker was more than the combined budget total of the first six EON James Bond movies put together and it shows how clunky, it is. I guess, people at the time, wanted a less serious spy-thriller as it made a lot of money at the box office at the time. Overall Campy as hell, but still entertaining.

I truly admired Krzysztof Kieslowski's approach with the film as filmmakers these days seem to try their best to cater towards the audience's expectations and resolve the character's story the way that is acceptable for them, which at times hurt the film's emotional and thematic impact. The film doesn't let us get too close to our protagonist, Julie, we never at any moment get inside her head, we only have her actions and her words to shape our perspective of her and I think this approach kind of left me a tad bit detached at some moments and finding it hard to empathise, but I think the director wanted us to not let the film speak itself too frankly, he wants us to keep coming back and observing her, hoping that each visit would let us become closer to the character and develop a unique understanding of who she is, what she is feeling, and how she would get through it.The film also explores Julie's coping mechanism of her depression and grief. Julie's way of coping is definitely not something a psychiatrist or counsellor would recommend as her remedy is to isolate herself from the objects that could bring about memories of her loved ones. Julie also engages herself in activities like swimming, which at first I thought was her way of distracting herself from the recurring thoughts of her family, as the film went on I started to see what Kieslowski was trying to create with those scenes, she is swimming in her sadness and at times drowning herself in it. This held me back in thinking she is close to moving on with her life, but since the director is going for something more realistic in dealing with depression, I was more willing to let myself accept the decisions that the characters make. Throughout the late second-third act of the film, we are treated to a side of Julie that wasn't primarily seen at the start of the film. We get to see her immerse herself in the art of music, which I found to be highly entertaining as this gives us a glimpse of what she used to be and how talented she was before the tragic event.I cannot go into high subjective detail on the film's cinematography as I feel that I need to go through this once more before I could properly criticize the choices that both the director and cinematographer have taken. All I could say for now is that the photography of the film captures that distance between us and the protagonist perfectly, no matter how close the camera is we could never fully penetrate her. There were a couple of times where I did feel the use of the color blue was a bit too emphasised in a couple of shots, but then over time I was able to get through it and appreciate it's usage, particularly the scenes that involves Julie swimming in the large pool. The film at times switches between mounted and stable shots to hand held tracking shots. The director is manipulating how much of the character we see, there are times where the film lets us in and at times we only see partially or are too far away from the character.The film's score was a definitely one of the film's highlights as the score creates this sense of impact during particular moments in the film, accurately representing how she feels at that given moment. The film was clever enough to have the film's protagonist be aware of the music, as the music seems to play as a reminder of the event and at the same time a sense of inspiration in how his husband's magnum opus composition should turn out. Since both the protagonist and the audience can hear the music, we are able to feel a sense of empathy, which is something of a rarity throughout the film.The film's acting was mainly anchored by Juliette Binoche and she does a wonderful job here. I have only seen the actress on Abbas Kiarostami's Certified Copy which I thought she did a great job with, but her performance in this film took my perspective of her even further. Binoche is an outstanding actress who definitely deserves more credit than she currently has as when he embodies a role, she does it with such precision that one's previous understanding of the actress would be wiped clean when starting a new film. Just on scenes where the camera captures a close up of her face, she doesn't reveal much but it definitely does not seem hollow, there is something there but one has to look harder in order to obtain it.Blue is a great film that contains a wonderful and powerful performance from Juliette Binoche and a story that avoids from being predictable. If one places an effort to understand and connect with the character, then one would be left highly rewarded by the end of the film.

Since both the protagonist and the audience can hear the music, we are able to feel a sense of empathy, which is something of a rarity throughout the film.The film's acting was mainly anchored by Juliette Binoche and she does a wonderful job here. I have only seen the actress on Abbas Kiarostami's Certified Copy which I thought she did a great job with, but her performance in this film took my perspective of her even further. Binoche is an outstanding actress who definitely deserves more credit than she currently has as when he embodies a role, she does it with such precision that one's previous understanding of the actress would be wiped clean when starting a new film. Just on scenes where the camera captures a close up of her face, she doesn't reveal much but it definitely does not seem hollow, there is something there but one has to look harder in order to obtain it.Blue is a great film that contains a wonderful and powerful performance from Juliette Binoche and a story that avoids from being predictable. If one places an effort to understand and connect with the character, then one would be left highly rewarded by the end of the film. ","genre":"Drama, Music, Mystery"},{"date":"11 June 2014","score":"","review":" Review In A NutshellBlue tells the tale of a woman who is trying to cope with a recent car accident that involved the death of her husband and child.Blue is one of those films where one couldn't predict the ending, as there wasn't a measurable goal established during the first or second act of the film and the director was aiming for a sense of realism when shaping the lead protagonist, therefore the character would not be following the traditional path of absolution and instead making one that is tailored for the character. I truly admired Krzysztof Kieslowski's approach with the film as filmmakers these days seem to try their best to cater towards the audience's expectations and resolve the character's story the way that is acceptable for them, which at times hurt the film's emotional and thematic impact. The film doesn't let us get too close to our protagonist, Julie, we never at any moment get inside her head, we only have her actions and her words to shape our perspective of her and I think this approach kind of left me a tad bit detached at some moments and finding it hard to empathise, but I think the director wanted us to not let the film speak itself too frankly, he wants us to keep coming back and observing her, hoping that each visit would let us become closer to the character and develop a unique understanding of who she is, what she is feeling, and how she would get through it.The film also explores Julie's coping mechanism of her depression and grief. Julie's way of coping is definitely not something a psychiatrist or counsellor would recommend as her remedy is to isolate herself from the objects that could bring about memories of her loved ones. Julie also engages herself in activities like swimming, which at first I thought was her way of distracting herself from the recurring thoughts of her family, as the film went on I started to see what Kieslowski was trying to create with those scenes, she is swimming in her sadness and at times drowning herself in it. This held me back in thinking she is close to moving on with her life, but since the director is going for something more realistic in dealing with depression, I was more willing to let myself accept the decisions that the characters make. Throughout the late second-third act of the film, we are treated to a side of Julie that wasn't primarily seen at the start of the film. We get to see her immerse herself in the art of music, which I found to be highly entertaining as this gives us a glimpse of what she used to be and how talented she was before the tragic event.I cannot go into high subjective detail on the film's cinematography as I feel that I need to go through this once more before I could properly criticize the choices that both the director and cinematographer have taken. All I could say for now is that the photography of the film captures that distance between us and the protagonist perfectly, no matter how close the camera is we could never fully penetrate her. There were a couple of times where I did feel the use of the color blue was a bit too emphasised in a couple of shots, but then over time I was able to get through it and appreciate it's usage, particularly the scenes that involves Julie swimming in the large pool. The film at times switches between mounted and stable shots to hand held tracking shots.
