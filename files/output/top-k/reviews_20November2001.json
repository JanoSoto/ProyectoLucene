The book and the film are timeless classics. I think it is the greatest adaptation of a novel (any genre) ever made and one of the most under-rated movies of all-time. They managed to capture more of a long novel (nearly 500 fantastic pages) than most films can compile from a 200 page source work. The soundtrack is beautiful (I'll be getting one for a Christmas present--thanx for the info IMDb!!) and matches the mood of the scenes perfectly.Viewers will recognize someone they know in nearly every rabbit and, with unbiased observation, probably see themselves. It is at once gripping and gentle, heart-rending and endearing. You will find yourself humming the tunes incessantly for months afterward. I recommend reading the book first (also try Traveler by Adams, another classic), then purchasing the film, then the soundtrack--wait, better yet, write your Congressman and demand a DVD release. I long for another wide-screen viewing (hint, hint)!I have noticed multiple comments that state the movie is too violent for children (it is somewhat graphic--to it's credit). For very small children, I would whole-heartedly agree, however, I think it depends on the individual. I was lucky enough to have a Father who took me to see it at the theatre when I was a youngster (about 5) and it did not scar me or give me nightmares--rather I learned the importance of the symbiotic circle of existence and the reality and necessity of life and death. It is still a comfort to me in times of sadness. In addition, the movie is highly layered and something new can be gleaned with nearly every viewing.I enjoyed it for years and only later realized many people had never even heard of it...I take every opportunity to recommend it and not once, not once, have I heard anything but thanks for the suggestion. Most of them end up owning the film. Both symbolic and blunt, Watership Down is a triumph of emotional proportions and is exemplary of what adaptations, animation, scoring and good film-making should be about.

The pressure to keep Harry Potter true to form was immense here is a story every kid and adult not only has read over and over but knows every minutae by heart. There would be no foolin' those kids this time around. Any detail left out, any stone left unturned, would be noticed and bemoaned. This is a big factor as to why the movie clocked in at 152 minutes. (What are they going to do when book four rolls around? There will have to be an intermission to pick up one's senses from the theatre floor.) So it was director Christopher Columbus' big challenge to stay true to form, capture the essence of the Harry Potter story, and not alienate every crazed and charmed fan out there. While he succeeded at all of these things, did he make a good movie?It's hard to say. The movie is certainly entertaining, sticks to the book like glue, and is a work of art and special effects. But does it capture the magic of J.K. Rowling's superb storytelling is a good question. Oddly it doesn't. It almost sticks to the book too much. If you have read the book more than once and oozed in the characters and plot line like I have, there's nothing in this film that surprises you. And that, unfortunately, is the element missing from making this a masterpiece of a film. You know what is coming around the corner. You know what Hermione is going to say before she says it. You know that Professor Quirrel is up to something.However, the all-star cast is wonderful, and the special effects are perfect-they don't overshadow the film and yet add just the right touch to spark your imagination. I was not particularly impressed with any of the three children's performances but they portray the characters just fine. Everyone portrayed the characters a little too well. They seemed like cardboard, in a way-the exception being a surprise cameo by John Cleese.My recommendation is to certainly go see it, especially if you have read the books. It's fun just to bring a well-loved book to life, even if there are no sparks to the movie version.

At least this is the impression I have from viewing the new Harry Potter film. Harry Potter has become an icon to the western world in recent years and with the skyrocketing sales of his last adventure, Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire, it seemed only fitting that a film should follow and thus, abracadabra, with but a budget in hand, it came to be.The world seems to rave at his wonder, as Harry Potter, the abused orphaned boy, is taken from his horrid relatives to study at Hogwart?s Academy of Wizards, a place where children of certain magical lines learn to perform magic that can never be performed in the outside world. Unfortunately, this film should have stayed in that mystical realm. Like The Grinch Who Stole Christmas and the recent remake of Planet of the Apes, this is another film with a story that rambles, filled with two-dimensional characters, that struggle their way through the special effects. Amazingly, Steve Kloves, who had previously scripted Flash and Bone and The Fabulous Baker Boys, this time steps up to the plate and misses as does Christopher Columbus, director of Home Alone, Home Alone 2, Mrs. Doubtfire and Bicentennial Man. Those were comedies. This is not.Grinchlike, the first flaws are apparently from the lack of perspective. Every angle in every scene is shot hideously close. Seldom is there anything but close-ups of everyone and everything. There is a sense of suffocation. But then, this film, like the Grinch, was made with the eventual dvd sales in mind, to be shown on a small screen. The opening shot starts out muddy, both in plot and in the graininess of the film, and eventually describes how Harry Potter got the sorcerer?s stone, a piece of glowing rock that has little to do with most of the story of Harry?s birth to depth struggle as wizard boy of legendary fame, who as a small child was able to inexplicably defeat the greatest of all evils. The fact of the matter is that as a wizard, Harry is not all that wizardly. His greatest skill seems to be that he can ride a broom better than any of the other wiz kids, but in the spells department, he is just smoke and mirrors. Why the film was not just called Hogwart?s is beyond me, for Harry Potter himself is of little significance to the film, other than the fact that everyone knows from the start that he has to be the one to save the day if only because his name is in the title.While none of the kids playing the parts really had any prior acting experience, each handles their roles quite well. Film legend, Richard Harris had his career magically resurrected to star in this spell of tedium. The rest of the cast are generally well-suited to their roles. And that is where any chance the film had ends. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer?s Stone might have been a decent film. The problem is that Kloves made the mistake of so many of his profession in trying to translate too much of the bound volume and make it work on the screen. The result was a jumble of scenes, none of which depended on each other or held to a single storyline. I remember thinking to myself as I yawned my way through the more than two hours of this less than magical film, why could it not have been more like Young Sherlock Holmes?No doubt I will be in the minority in my views of this big budgeted event. No doubt there are so many Harry Potter fans who look for anything Harry Potter, like the Star Wars diehards a generation ago, that I would be sorcerousy stoned if I spake these words in plain sight.

I, like crate-loads of others have read the book and waited for the film and I wasn't disappointed.From the moment the John Williams score kicks in at the beginning (reminiscent of the score that he created for Hook), and the view of an average road in Britain comes into view the tingling feeling builds of something so normal-looking can suddenly feel very magical and that is the key for this film working.The sets and scenery are wonderfully thought out, created and used, with the correct mix of CG and real locations, costumes and props, especially Alnwick Castle and Gloucester Cathedral.  This comes as a refreshing change to those films which use CG to excess or do not use it right.  The highlight of the CG is the quidditch game, which really does give a good feel of what would happen.The acting was also superb, with the veterans doing their job brilliantly in showing the skill that they have without over-powering the younger cast members.  Richard Harris brings the dignity that was seen in Gladiator when he played the role of the old emperor; The portrayal of one who knows that he has the power but does not want to force it on others comes across very well.  Maggie Smith comes shining through with role of Professor McGonagal, with Robbie Coltrane being the closest at stealing the thunder away from the youngsters in his role of Hagrid.And onto the younger cast members.  The pressure that they had to live up to was handled very well, with Rupert Grint and Emma Watson providing good supporting roles whilst Daniel Radcliffe carries the role of Harry himself very well.  There are times at which he does seem to be a little overpowered by some of the others but this seems to emphasise the position that the character could be in, of everyone else seeming to know more about him than he does.  It will be interesting to see how the character has changed by the next film.The only downside is that due to the level of detail and writing skills of the author some parts have had to be cut out from the film.  As it is the film is two an a half hours long and there was still at least another 1 hours-worth of back story which could have been told!  It is an unenviable position for the screenwriter to be in.  For those who have read the book, enough is known to leave certain parts out, and the story still making sense, but then face the wrath of the audience for the parts that are missed out (mainly pre-Hogwarts), yet for those who have not read the book but want to see what the fuss is about then some key things may be missed (mainly the Dursley's going insane for comical value!) and the real development of relationships between Harry and his family).It is worth seeing this film if only to complement the imagery of the book.

The books had been read, the news of the film heard and now enough people to create over 100 million pounds worth of sales have seen it.  I, like crate-loads of others have read the book and waited for the film and I wasn't disappointed.From the moment the John Williams score kicks in at the beginning (reminiscent of the score that he created for Hook), and the view of an average road in Britain comes into view the tingling feeling builds of something so normal-looking can suddenly feel very magical and that is the key for this film working.The sets and scenery are wonderfully thought out, created and used, with the correct mix of CG and real locations, costumes and props, especially Alnwick Castle and Gloucester Cathedral.  This comes as a refreshing change to those films which use CG to excess or do not use it right.  The highlight of the CG is the quidditch game, which really does give a good feel of what would happen.The acting was also superb, with the veterans doing their job brilliantly in showing the skill that they have without over-powering the younger cast members.  Richard Harris brings the dignity that was seen in Gladiator when he played the role of the old emperor; The portrayal of one who knows that he has the power but does not want to force it on others comes across very well.  Maggie Smith comes shining through with role of Professor McGonagal, with Robbie Coltrane being the closest at stealing the thunder away from the youngsters in his role of Hagrid.And onto the younger cast members.  The pressure that they had to live up to was handled very well, with Rupert Grint and Emma Watson providing good supporting roles whilst Daniel Radcliffe carries the role of Harry himself very well.  There are times at which he does seem to be a little overpowered by some of the others but this seems to emphasise the position that the character could be in, of everyone else seeming to know more about him than he does.  It will be interesting to see how the character has changed by the next film.The only downside is that due to the level of detail and writing skills of the author some parts have had to be cut out from the film.  As it is the film is two an a half hours long and there was still at least another 1 hours-worth of back story which could have been told!  It is an unenviable position for the screenwriter to be in.

At least this is the impression I have from viewing the new Harry Potter film.  Harry Potter has become an icon to the western world in recent years and with the skyrocketing sales of his last adventure, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, it seemed only fitting that a film should follow and thus, abracadabra, with but a budget in hand, it came to be.The world seems to rave at its wonder, as Harry Potter, the abused orphaned boy, is taken from his horrid relatives to study at Hogwart's Academy of Wizards, a place where children of certain magical lines learn to perform magic that can never be performed in the outside world. Unfortunately, this film should have stayed in that mystical realm. Like The Grinch Who Stole Christmas and the recent remake of Planet of the Apes, this is another film with a story that rambles, filled with two-dimensional characters, that struggle their way through the special effects. Amazing, Steve Kloves, who had previously scripted Flash and Bone and The Fabulous Baker Boys, this time steps up to the plate and misses as does director Christopher Columbus, director of Home Alone, Home Alone 2, Mrs. Doubtfire and Bicentennial Man. Those were comedies. This was not. Grinchlike, the first flaws are apparently from the lack of propective.Every angle in every scene is shot hideously close. Seldom is there anything but close-ups of everyone and everything. There is a sense of suffocation. But then, this film, like the Grinch, was made with the eventual dvd sales in mind, to be shown on a small screen. The opening shot starts out muddy, both in plot and in the graininess of the film, that supposedly describe how Harry Potter got the sorcerer's stone, a piece of glowing rock that has little to do with most of the story of Harry's birth to depth struggle as wizard boy of legendary fame, who as a small child was able to inexplicably defeat the greatest of all evils. The fact of the matter is that as a wizard, Harry is not all that wizardly. His greatest skill seems to be that he can ride a broom better than any of the other wiz kids, but in the spells department, he is just smoke and mirrors. Why the film was not just called Hogwart's is beyond me, for Harry Potter himself is of little significance to the film, other than the fact that one knows from the start that he has to be the one to save the day if only because his name is in the title. While none of the kids really had any prior acting experience, each handles their roles quite well, as do the rest of the cast. Film legend, Richard Harris had his career magically resurrected to star in this spell of tedium. The rest of the cast are generally well-suited to their roles. And that is where any chance the film had ends. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone might have been a decent film. The problem was that Kloves made the mistake of so many of his profession in trying to translate too much of the bound story and make it work on the screen. The result was a jumble of scenes, none of which depended on each other held a single storyline. I remember thinking to myself as I yawned my way through the more than two hours of this less than magical film, why could it not have been more like Young Sherlock Holmes?No doubt I will be in the minority in my views of this big budgeted event. No doubt there are so many Harry Potter fans who look for anything Harry Potter, like the Star Wars diehards a generation ago, that I would be stoned if I spake these words in plain sight.

Heck, I actually LIKED the monster, even if they are just animating the Jurassic Park 'raptor' model on a macro scale, especially for the baby monsters.The point is, this is obviously not Godzilla, not by any stretch of the imagination. They don't even take the time to explain WHY the beast is CALLED 'Godzilla' (or actually, 'Gojira', as they take enough time to make a lame joke about). The solution don't call the movie 'Godzilla'. Give your new monster a new name and put the movie out.Still, even if they HAD done this, it would have been a pathetic movie nonetheless. The monster, interesting though it was, is a big part of this problem.GINO (Godzilla In Name Only), as the monster will hereafter be referred to, simply doesn't seem to exist. Yes, the rubber-suit Godzilla was hokey and campy, but he had some stage presence, for crying out loud. GINO is nothing but a special effect. Since it can't actually be filmed against a real background, even a campy miniature of downtown Osaka, it never gets the chance to truly interact with its environment. When your audience can't believe in your title character, your movie fails.Another little suggestion for future filmmaking either DO, or DON'T. I'm referring here to the tacked on 'fire-breathing' scenes that appeared twice in the version I saw. Being a longtime Godzilla fan (the real one), I was involved in several discussion groups and online lists while this movie was in production. One of the questions that kept recurring was, 'Does the new Godzilla breathe fire?' The answer we finally got from the source was 'No, it does not,' but they didn't have the guts to stick by that. In a pathetic attempt to win the true Godzilla fans over, they spliced in two post-production scenes of Gino bending low over burning debris and apparently just exhaling forcefully enough to LOOK like it was breathing fire. Bad, bad choice.Speaking of bad, bad, how about that dialogue? How hard IS it to pronounce 'Tatopoulis', anyway? It's a FOUR-SYLLABLE-NAME. It's not even a remotely challenging Greek surname, so the attempt to make a running gag out of it falls as flat as the acting itself.This movie can't be fairly compared to the Toho Godzilla series, because the two are totally different. Apples and oranges, as the saying goes. However, taken on its own merits, TriStar's 'Godzilla' is still pathetic.

The smile of Mickey Rourke (he plays John) is intriguing but bores after a while.  As for Kim Basinger (Liz), her acting performance is not the best in the world.  The ending is not good, much is inane.  But let's grant the film the favor of commenting on what it is really about.Nine 1\/2 Weeks is is an exposition on sexual fantasies, quite a variety of them, but strictly soft-porn -- more like soft-soft porn.  It really is not very revealing and does not have hot sex scenes.  The movie is about male dominance, female submission.  The assumption from many would be, yes a man can certainly get into male dominance, of course, although that is not all men either.  However, Nine 1\/2 Weeks is seen by much of the intelligentsia of both sexes as something a woman can get into, too, while some women resent it.  But for one thing, I just think the movie, to fulfill its purpose, could have included some female dominance stuff too.  You know, men can get into that too, some anyway.  For women with their antenna out, that would not be so bad, would it?  But I guess it would, if the overall premise is criticized and consistency is observed.  Anyway, the movie could have been a bit longer to accommodate this desire for those who wanted it, with scattered nonsex junk cut as well.Another issue is camera work, camera choices (I won't say cinematography).  Readers can trust me, I hope, in saying it is not my fantasy for a women to crawl on her hands and knees, rear up, to me.  When it comes to food substances, perhaps there can be some broader-based appeal.  In other words, I am suggesting that, based on the variety of things it can offer, maybe more men would enjoy some aspect of wet and messy than they do a women crawling.  Maybe not.  But on this premise, I suggest that a problem with the scenes involving food--cherries, honey, other liquids--was that the photography was too close up.  Maybe the ice scene was OK as is.  But for the rest, it appeared the director wanted to be restrained--less coverage, no broader, more elaborate images.  No whipped cream (or other things one could think up), limited facial coverage, in these scenes, no nudity.  Like the lack of regular sex content.I liked the outdoor rain\/shower scene, and the dance-and-strip (sort of) -to-music scene.  The spank rape scene?  Even if someone has some deep-seated fantasy resembling this in any way, I question whether anyone can be entertained by such a basic (or, base) and immediate presentation as was made here.

Lisa, with John, clothed, spreading her legs on a bed in the store in front of the middle-aged women was amusing, but also a metaphor for the movie.  Something more could have been worked in, and more thought (not just mine) could have been put into it, and, at least for me, some things could have been taken out.

Watching it again yesterday for the xth time, it was amazing how much detail and points of reference I can see that I never saw before; for me, the hallmark of a masterpiece.  The echoes of a 40s film noir detective thriller are self-evident; the hair, the clothes, the constant darkness and rain, and also the fact that everyone smokes, and when they do they create vast plumes of smoke.  Whether this is intentional I do not know, but is eerily effective.  The film is incredibly well balanced (never seems like 1hour 50mins, does it?), the lighting is superb, the shadows and the strange focusing on the characters all very powerful.  I have always been fascinated with the close-ups on the eyes, even the animals in the film.  The flashes of red burning in the darkness.  But again, this just echoes that which has already been said a thousand times by other critics.  My personal views are that which I would really like to express. In comparison to other great works, such as the Godfather, which shines due to its excellent depiction by the actors concerned, I feel Blade Runner is powerful for the very opposite.  The characters to me are not incredibly strong, indeed Harrison Ford plays down his role throughout, I think.

The best movie I've seen him in to date is Fallen, although I haven't seen Malcolm X, so can't comment on that. For me, the difference between Fallen and most of Denzel's other roles is an edge, a sharpness, a *reality* that just doesn't appear in movies like The Hurricane or Remember the Titans. To put it as my friend does, we wanted to see Denzel play a character that would 'kick puppies and step on kittens' for a change. This movie takes what he brought to Fallen and puts it on steroids.Washington is Alonzo Harris, a corrupt cop. A man who believes he's part of the big time but, in reality, he's just a small-time criminal hiding behind his LAPD badge. As a member of a covert narcotics squad, he gets to cruise the streets of LA looking for his next big bust. He may have originally been a fresh-faced rookie with an idealistic streak and a notion that justice involved returning the streets to the community, but his thirteen-year tour of duty in the narc unit have left him jaded, disillusioned, and willing to do whatever it takes. Throw young Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) into the mix. Hoyt is that self-same fresh-faced rookie with an idealistic streak, a young wife, and a nine-month-old daughter. He's looking to make detective, and wants nothing more than to be able to provide for his family and take down the questionable elements of society that run rampant in downtown LA. Alonzo, however, has totally different ideas about Jake's future.Alonzo seems to have surrounded himself with a plethora of fools, and it's implied during the film that he's done it so that he can keep control. Because as long as Alonzo has control of the men in his unit, has control of the streets--which he rules with an iron fist--he has control of his life. As he gets to know Jake, however, he can see that there's something different about him...that he's not going to be just another follower. Jake has one single day to prove to Alonzo that he can cut it as a narc. Failure means he goes back to 'cutting traffic tickets' and maybe never gets his coveted job as detective. MINI-SPOILER However, an incident in Las Vegas with some nebulously defined and never-seen Russians suddenly has Alonzo in over his head. He has to provide a million dollars by midnight or his life is forfeit. His upper-echelon contacts (the semi-satirical 'Wise Men') are worried that he's not going to be able to find the money, and then they'll lose their man on the street, the guy who can be relied upon to get things done when the system can't. But Alonzo has a plan, and that plan centres around Jake. END MINI-SPOILERWashington turns in an incredibly driven and fiercely charismatic performance as Alonzo. Hawke, as his counterpoint, plays his role in a perfectly understated fashion, which only adds to Washington's impact in the film. Washington's character *needs* to be compared to a bland background, just so you can appreciate exactly what it is that's going on.But when the film comes to its resolution, we're still left with the question unanswered. Which view is the right one? Does Jake's initial idealism have a place in the warzone--the drug-fuelled hotbed of intolerance and violence that is 'the office' for these covert narcs? Or is Alonzo's brutal and almost fanatical version of justice the only way to catch--and kill--the wolves prowling around the edges of the flock?It's also refreshing to see a movie on this subject-matter that doesn't have a 'message'. Training Day simply explores the issues and puts them on the table, and whilst some people may believe it falls down on one side more than the other, I prefer to see it as giving the audience the option to make their own decision. The real stinger though, is that despite his unorthodox methods, his disregard for due process, and his uncompromising, severe attitude, Alonzo shares the same ideals as Jake. Both of them want to eliminate the scum of the streets. However, whereas Jake wants to create his perfect Aryan-esque world where it's safe for a fourteen-year-old to walk through the worst parts of town in the dead of night, Alonzo is much more interested in landing the biggest of fish--whatever the cost. Pros Superb acting from Washington and a fine counterpoint by Hawke. A fast-paced character- and event-driven drama that assaults the senses and leaves you reeling from its mental impact. Cons The last ten\/fifteen minutes or so may leave some unsatisfied.Likely Oscar nominations Well, I'm going to forego my usual comical comment here. Seriously, Denzel should get _something_ for his performance in this movie. It's just a pity this is the sort of movie the Academy usually overlooks. Verdict A tour-de-force led by Washington that proves that violence and intelligence don't necessarily have to be mutually exclusive in a modern movie. Go see if if you liked Fallen, or want to see what Denzel can really do when he turns on the afterburner. Plus the ins and outs of this movie can easily lead to lengthy discussions over coffee afterwards.9 out of 10.

It's also applicable to this movie, as one is probably better off not having a brain when watching it - or, if one is in possession of a brain, it'll be all mushy and spongy afterwards.Can you see where I'm going with this? Swordfish is profoundly stupid, with profoundly stupid characters doing profoundly stupid things. It's an insult to anyone's intelligence.  While you watch it, your brain turns to jello.Now, granted, this happens with a lot of current action movies, but this one sinks so quickly and so authoritatively into the great abyss of suckitude that you can hardly pause to catch your breath. Oh, but wait - it's not so exciting that you actually lose your breath.Gabriel Shear (John Travolta, sporting yet another goofy hairdo), is a megalomaniacal hacker with oodles of cash. He's reclusive but dangerous; he hires world-famous hackers to break into bank accounts and steal money electronically. He's ruthless, too, caring more about his single goal (which is thankfully revealed midway through the movie) than about other people's lives, no matter how many are lost.Shear picks up ex-hacker Stanley (Hugh Jackman), who went to prison for hacking into the FBI and setting back their computer system two years. Stanley's forbidden from seeing his evercute daughter by his trailer-trash, porn-star ex-wife, and he lacks the cash to fight the custody in court. Can you see where this is leading?Shear sends one of his top lieutenants, Ginger (Halle Berry) to pick up Stanley, and she convinces him to sign on. It's a simple gig - he gets $100,000 just for meeting Gabriel, and he can walk away if he doesn't like the deal he'll be offered. Right. Like anyone in a movie like this would say no to that. If Stanley were really bright, he'd sense right off that Gabriel is a Bad Guy - people don't just give $100,000 away for a meeting, you know. But Stanley's not too swift, so he goes along. Presumably he also goes because Halle Berry asked him nicely.At any rate, Stanley accepts the cash to go visit Shear, who needs someone to break an encrypted network in 60 seconds. I'm not going to bog down this review with technical lingo about how Stanley accomplishes it, mainly because I have no idea. The way hacking is almost always portrayed on the silver screen is by having one disheveled (usually young, although Stanley's in his early to mid-thirties) hacker type really, really, really fast, hitting a million keys in about 15 seconds, then dramatically hitting enter and looking triumphant. So Stanley has to pull off this kind of feat, under enormous pressure (in more ways than one).Now, by this point you're supposed to be sympathizing with Stanley. He's the good guy, right? He's doing this against his will, right? And he only wants to see his daughter, right? The screenwriters don't leave much out when making Stanley out to be a solid Good Guy. Heck, the only reason he cracked the FBI computer was out of a sense of goodwill. So he's a hacker with a cause.Ordinarily, you'd think a movie about hacking into computers would be dull - and it would be if all we had to look at was a computer screen. So Shear crashes some cars, takes hostages, commandeers a bus and a helicopter, and so on. It's kind of like Speed, but not ON speed, if you catch my drift. There's only so many of the same old crashes and smashes before the ol' consciousness decides to take an extended nap.On the video and DVD boxes for Swordfish, there's a warning about the violent content. The warning notes that the movie was made before September 11, 2001 and that there are some scenes in the movie that might be unsettling for some people. I'll save you the trouble - those scenes are when Gabriel acts like a terrorist overtly, rather than just subtly (you keep expecting him to do an evil laugh), and while it is possible people who lost loved ones on September 11 might feel a little uneasy with them, I think they'd react more strongly to the mind-numbing stupidity of the entire movie. Why focus on just a couple of scenes when the whole thing is like a giant drone bee, buzzing endlessly and saying nothing?A quick look at the cast. The good guys look good, the bad guys look bad. Ginger's on the fence - is she good? Is she bad? Is she both? Do we care? Halle Berry hasn't had a good role in a few years, but this one should have been easy for her. It just seems to me that the sole reason for having her there was for her to look pretty. She's not bad at that - and even does a gratuitous topless scene - but lends little in the way of substance to a movie that was already sorely lacking it. Jackman's not bad, but he's not nearly as commanding as he needs to be. It's another one of those movies where the criminal is a much stronger character and overwhelms that of the good guy.Parents There's a lot of violence in the movie, and although most of it is cartoonish, some of it might hit too close to home.

He's ruthless, too, caring more about his single goal (which is thankfully revealed midway through the movie) than about other people's lives, no matter how many are lost.Shear picks up ex-hacker Stanley (Hugh Jackman), who went to prison for hacking into the FBI and setting back their computer system two years. Stanley's forbidden from seeing his evercute daughter by his trailer-trash, porn-star ex-wife, and he lacks the cash to fight the custody in court. Can you see where this is leading?Shear sends one of his top lieutenants, Ginger (Halle Berry) to pick up Stanley, and she convinces him to sign on. It's a simple gig - he gets $100,000 just for meeting Gabriel, and he can walk away if he doesn't like the deal he'll be offered. Right. Like anyone in a movie like this would say no to that. If Stanley were really bright, he'd sense right off that Gabriel is a Bad Guy - people don't just give $100,000 away for a meeting, you know. But Stanley's not too swift, so he goes along. Presumably he also goes because Halle Berry asked him nicely.At any rate, Stanley accepts the cash to go visit Shear, who needs someone to break an encrypted network in 60 seconds. I'm not going to bog down this review with technical lingo about how Stanley accomplishes it, mainly because I have no idea. The way hacking is almost always portrayed on the silver screen is by having one disheveled (usually young, although Stanley's in his early to mid-thirties) hacker type really, really, really fast, hitting a million keys in about 15 seconds, then dramatically hitting enter and looking triumphant. So Stanley has to pull off this kind of feat, under enormous pressure (in more ways than one).Now, by this point you're supposed to be sympathizing with Stanley. He's the good guy, right? He's doing this against his will, right? And he only wants to see his daughter, right? The screenwriters don't leave much out when making Stanley out to be a solid Good Guy. Heck, the only reason he cracked the FBI computer was out of a sense of goodwill. So he's a hacker with a cause.Ordinarily, you'd think a movie about hacking into computers would be dull - and it would be if all we had to look at was a computer screen. So Shear crashes some cars, takes hostages, commandeers a bus and a helicopter, and so on. It's kind of like Speed, but not ON speed, if you catch my drift. There's only so many of the same old crashes and smashes before the ol' consciousness decides to take an extended nap.On the video and DVD boxes for Swordfish, there's a warning about the violent content. The warning notes that the movie was made before September 11, 2001 and that there are some scenes in the movie that might be unsettling for some people. I'll save you the trouble - those scenes are when Gabriel acts like a terrorist overtly, rather than just subtly (you keep expecting him to do an evil laugh), and while it is possible people who lost loved ones on September 11 might feel a little uneasy with them, I think they'd react more strongly to the mind-numbing stupidity of the entire movie. Why focus on just a couple of scenes when the whole thing is like a giant drone bee, buzzing endlessly and saying nothing?A quick look at the cast. The good guys look good, the bad guys look bad. Ginger's on the fence - is she good? Is she bad? Is she both? Do we care? Halle Berry hasn't had a good role in a few years, but this one should have been easy for her. It just seems to me that the sole reason for having her there was for her to look pretty. She's not bad at that - and even does a gratuitous topless scene - but lends little in the way of substance to a movie that was already sorely lacking it. Jackman's not bad, but he's not nearly as commanding as he needs to be. It's another one of those movies where the criminal is a much stronger character and overwhelms that of the good guy.Parents There's a lot of violence in the movie, and although most of it is cartoonish, some of it might hit too close to home. Most adults can see through violence in movies with no problem, separating it from reality, but kids don't always have that ability.

The acting is also great, my favourites being Steve Buscemi(Mr Pink) and Harvey Keitel(Mr White). I also have to say some things about some other comments people have given this - 1) One guy said that all they ever talk about is the job at hand compared to Pulp Fiction's real life dialogue. Well, they're hardly going to start talking to each-other about last night's game when everyone has just got shot to peices, are they? 2)-SPOILER- When Mr Blonde cuts the cop's ear off, people say that Mr Orange should have stopped him before that. Well, did you not notice that when the others left Mr Blonde alone with him, he was unconcious? 3)The violence. Oh, I certainly can't deny that there is a huge amount of violence in this - but you can't really watch Reservoir Dogs without knowing beforehand that it is very violent, so if it puts you off, you should have known better than to see it. Overall, it isn't quite as good as Pulp Fiction, but is so, so close. I fully recommend it, unless you're squeamish, or a woman(I'm not being sexist, honest to God I'm not, but women generally wouldn't like it to much). However, I have two problems - 1) Mr Brown and Mr Blue. You hardly see them at all in the movie, and I'm surprised Mr Blue was even mentioned in the credits at all!

Freddy Got Fingered is one of the most unusual films I have ever seen.

Gordy, our uh... hero, played by Tom Greene (who thankfully just acts like himself instead of trying to create a character), is a 28 yr. old slacker, a little kid living in the body of an adult. He's trying to impress dad in his own way and failing miserably. You can tell that after years of emotional neglect Gordy's resorted to shock value, the only thing that seems to get the old man's attention. His aberrant behavior is not confined to family situations either. Gordy figures acting like a complete idiot is the only thing that can get anyone's attention. Most of the time he's right. As he tries to make his shallow Hollywood dream come true, forms a relationship with an orally romantic paraplegic woman, and basically struggles to interact, he has to punctuate every moment with some bizarre twist in order to maintain control. Naturally, the consequences are always painfully funny. I found this movie to be a lot like one of my favorite shows of all time Chris Elliot's GET A LIFE. In fact FGF could be considered the GET A LIFE movie. As director, Tom Greene surrounded himself with solid actors (especially Rip Torn), a great DP, a great editor and a truly ingenious music supervisor- nearly every scene has a complimentary song playing underneath which amps the comedy up to eleven. And he wisely chose to give these people free rein to ply their craft too, instead of taking the hands-on role of director too seriously. This marriage of off-the-wall and by-the-books pays off. Don't get me wrong, FREDDY GOT FINGERED is not perfect. But it is surprisingly engaging and at moments, poignant. We actually feel for Gordy despite ourselves (and him). And we almost understand him resorting to such desperate measures as accusing his father of fingering his younger brother, Freddy (in case you were wondering where the title came from), jacking off horses and cutting a newborn's umbilical cord with his teeth. Oddly, there don't seem to be any cases where the shocking humor seems forced. In Gordy's world it all makes sense. And as visitors to Gordy's world, it makes sense to us. When I saw that this movie only had a 3.9 rating I had to give it a 10. It's obviously been misunderstood, most likely by Tom Greene fans who got more traditional story than they wanted, and traditional story fans who got more Tom Greene than they wanted.
