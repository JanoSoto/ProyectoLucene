Not only is it memorable in the fact that it was written by a woman in a time when women were considered the lesser of the two sexes, but it also set up new standards for science-fiction and horror that were expanded even further with following plays and ultimately the 1931 James Whale film of the same name, which featured Boris Karloff as the mutinous, growling monster created from dead bodies fused with electricity. Most of the criticism of the 1931 film focuses on the fact that it is only very loosely faithful to Mary Shelley's original novel. This 1994 adaptation, directed by and starring Kenneth Branagh, is by far, much more adhering to the text, but that does not make it a better film. I didn't think the 1931 Frankenstein was a great film, but it was still twice the entertainment that Branagh's is.The plot is the same one we're all familiar with. A young man (Kenneth Branagh) mad with the passion to create a living being in his own image recklessly instills life into a humanoid made from the bodies of dead men and creates a hapless, but unnaturally durable creature played uncharacteristically by Robert De Niro and before long, his mistake of playing God soon leads to chaos and people near to him fall victim and before long, he soon takes the responsibility of purging the creature under his own wing. But then there's the element that not all of us are familiar with. That the creature has a mind and a heart of its own and that it wants to meet its creator again, with some requests of its own.I do appreciate director\/star Branagh's will to stick with Mary Shelley's original novel, but what I did not appreciate was his failure at supplying us with an appreciable motion picture that ultimately turned out to be nothing more than pointless and forgettable.Like Roger Ebert said in his television review of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Kenneth Branagh has a habit of going over the top with his movies and this is another example. There are many scenes in this movie that are way too explosive, way too loud, and way too graphic to satisfy us such as this rather bloody and fast-moving stillbirth scene early in the picture that did not serve any real purpose in the story than just to give us something to look at.That's what this movie really is. Just something to look at. It's a good-looking movie. The cinematography is crystal-clear and beautiful, the set design and art direction is fabulous, the scenery is entrancing, it feels as if we were looking into an actual world far distant and different from our own. But what Mary Shelley's Frankenstein fails to give us is substance and story and development and in stead focuses on its visual impact, which again, goes way over the hill. In short, it gives us too much and not enough. And as a result, its two-hour running time causes it to overstay its welcome. There are scenes that go on for too long and were not necessary and there are scenes that go by too quickly, but were necessary. And with a movie like this, once the audience starts to lose interest, the look of the film doesn't amount to a hill of beans anymore.Are there any positive aspects to Mary Shelley's Frankenstein? Yes, there are. And some of them are quite powerful. Number one, Robert De Niro was fantastic as Frankenstein's creature. De Niro does not rely on his grotesque-looking makeup to give the impression of a troubled creature, but instead embraces and surpasses it with his performance and there were some scenes where I actually felt a little moved because he was so great in the movie. The creature, like in the novel, is not the big lumbering green-skinned monster with electrodes emerging from its neck and mindlessly attacking people in rage. Here we have a sympathetic and tragic living being with feelings and emotions and a mind equal to that of a man's. De Niro gives us the most impressive Frankenstein's creature we have seen yet, even better than the Boris Karloff performance from the original. And that was a classic image. Unfortunately, De Niro is not seen enough and Branagh is seen too much and unfortunately Branagh is playing a very dull Victor Frankenstein.That's another thing I might as well mention. Apart from De Niro, we have no interesting characters. Gene Siskel noted that Helena Bonham Carter's character as well as the others were treated mostly as props in the background and he was correct with his criticisms. I did not connect with any of the characters except for the creature and in a movie like this, that is imperative otherwise you're quickly losing interest.Bottom line, this is a real shame. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is a major missed opportunity. It's a well-acted, good-looking movie that I was still thoroughly bored with and unfortunately cannot suspend my disbelief and negative attitude toward the film to give it any recommendation except to those who want to see a faithful movie based on Mary Shelley's Gothic classic.

I have to assume that the Americanized version I watched as a kid was heavily edited so the context was lost.It was usually titled The Crawling Eye in the US, and the fact that it had Forrest Tucker (later better known for Comedy) makes you forget that this was in fact a British film.The plot is that a mysterious cloud appears in the Swiss Alps, accompanied by a number of unexplained deaths. A team of heroes which includes a mind reader and her sister, a scientist, a reporter and a UN investigator, fight a bunch of monsters who live in super-cold clouds.The climax is when they are trapped in the observatory, battling the beasts who are finally revealed to be one-eyed giant octopi. In many ways, the ending is anti-climatic because they did a very good job of building suspense without showing you the monster, but when the monster is revealed, well, it just kind of looked silly and could be easily defeated with Molotov Cocktails.This movie also has the distinction of being the first film mocked by Mystery Science Theatre 3000, which is kind of sad, because it isn't that bad of a film.

I've seen a few, but I haven't really loved any of them. A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE is not afraid to navigate the extremes of cruelty and kitschy tenderness, but it didn't do a whole lot more than make me laugh and wince a bit. CRASH was very interesting but not fun, and really only memorable for its subject matter- not for any great scenes or performances. DEAD RINGERS really stuck with me, but the movie as a whole is a bit muddled and overlong. And EXISTENZ is ill-conceived Sci-Fi with lots of gore. I walked into last night's midnight screening with nothing more than curiosity, but I'm very glad I went. The film print was grainy but the richness of the colors in the original film more than made up for it. THE FLY is a gory, shocking, confusing movie that truly challenges and rewards the viewer. It challenges the viewer to laugh, cry, and cringe, for there are moments when nothing other than all three are possible. The movie opens with Brundle meeting journalist Veronica at a scientific convention. With only the minimal dialog necessary, the action begins, as we see Brundle's attempts to teleport objects and Veronica's fascination with the man. We barely get to know the characters before they are in bed together and one of them is doing wild and crazy things with technology, but what is amazing is that, while it all happens so quickly, nothing remains too mysterious. The dialog is all very focused and to the point and Jeff Goldblum as Brundle manages to make even lengthy exposition into entertaining ramblings.Brundle, even before he becomes a fly, is highly entertaining to watch, and this is key to the movie's success. And his transformation is done extremely well, as he first merely demonstrates a fly-like stamina and agility before he transforms into a confused human insect.It is not only Brundle's transformation that is disgusting- there is also a brief and surprising scene in which he demonstrates his new insect powers as he breaks an arm wrestler's hand off at a bar. This scene is disgusting and campy, yet it manages to achieve just the right level of shock and hilarity, and it fits with the movie's absurd tone.The special effects in the movie were done at a period which I believe to be the peak of movie special effects, when computer animation was just enabling us to see things that weren't possible, like a human body transforming into a fly, but it wasn't sophisticated or cheap enough for filmmakers to rely on it the entire time. When Brundle is still a human fly, it is done entirely with makeup, which makes it extremely convincing. Today, it would almost definitely be done with CGI, not because it would look better, but merely because it is cheaper and easier. The movie would not be nearly as convincing if it were done with today's effects technology.And the effects would also not be nearly as impressive if it weren't for the fact that the movie ultimately relies on other things to intrigue us. The effects are so, well, effective, because they really feed our interest. The movie really gets us to ask, What will happen to this man as he turns into a fly? and builds suspense hanging on that single question, and the effects show us all of the gory details- and the details turn out to be even more gory than we'd imagine.It was THE FLY that convinced me Cronenberg deserves his good reputation. It's truly one of the great monster movies. ","genre":null},{"date":"7 March 2009","score":"","review":" At the IFC theater in NYC, there are weekly midnight screenings of Cronenberg movies.

Only it's worse than bad. It's a mind-numbing experience without a single inkling of pleasure to be found. Not even a guilty pleasure. While I wouldn't consider this to be Wood's worst, it's not far from it.Plan 9 is the strange and confusing sci-fi tale of, as its original title was, Grave Robbers from Outer Space (but the title was changed to Plan 9 because the producers, a Baptist church who though they'd make a fortune seeing as how the film would be marketed as Bela Lugosi's last film, thought it was blasphemous) who come down to earth, bring life to the dead, and use them to kill people. Basically, the aliens are upset because we stupid, stupid tellurians don't want to believe in them and they throw a fit with their zombies, ray guns, and wobbly flying saucers.Plan 9 from Outer Space is considered a legendary film not only because its notoriously bad, but because of the countless number of defects and continuity flaws and glaring errors that grace the screen before us as we view it. And this ranges from the special effects, the acting, the editing, the direction, and onward. We have flying saucers (which are just toys mounted on strings) flying in front of backdrops and we see them wobbling on strings, we see them cast shadows on their backgrounds, we see actors reading from cue cards and in one case, from a script in his lap, we see a microphone shadow on the wall behind the actors in plain view, Gregory Walcott refers to his wife's character by the actress's real name, we have constant inter cutting of daytime and nighttime even though the scenes are suppose to take place simultaneously in the same spot, and basically, yeah, you've got a very laughable production. But what's even greater is Bela Lugosi's part in the film. Lugosi had in fact died while making an earlier Wood film called The Ghoul Goes West or something like that, and the film was scrapped until Wood came up with the idea for this film and just spliced in the few seconds he'd shot with Lugosi into it to market it as Lugosi's last movie. Still, there were some parts where they needed a stand-in for Lugosi. So Wood hired his wife's chiropractor, who looked somewhat like Lugosi, and told him to wear the cape over the lower half of his face all the time. So there'll be moments where the cape's not over his face (the real Lugosi) and a split second later, it's back over his face (the chiropractor) and then back again and it becomes painfully obvious. There's even a moment where the cape starts to fall off and the doctor swiftly puts it back over again. And Wood still used the take, because he almost always used the first one.Despite all of these laughable flaws, which you would expect to spur laughter, Plan 9 from Outer Space still turns out to be a dismally dull excuse for a motion picture. Its plot even defies itself when the aliens, who are so desperate to prove their existence, try to cover up the murders they commit. They don't fear us, so what's with that? While watching it, we find ourselves looking at our watches very early on and nothing from that point on keeps us from repeating that. I'll be honest when I say that I turned off the show a third of the way through and watched something else. I actually did that once, a rare thing for me, and then tried again, actually managing to sit through the entire thing the second time around. Looking at Gregory Walcott perform, who reportedly called the script the worst he'd ever read, we get the impression he hated working on the film and I can understand that, because I hated watching the film. Now some fanatics have called Plan 9 a cult classic and described it as being so bad, it's good. Well, I did not enjoy it one bit, it's no classic in any regard, and I would describe it as so bad, it's direful. Looking at Ed Wood's films and knowing his story, I still admire him for his passion as a filmmaker, but surely, in those three years when he was trying to work with that Bela Lugosi footage, he surely could have written a compelling script and asked for a second take every once in a while. Maybe if he'd adjusted his style, he might have made a presentable film and perhaps lived up to his idol, Orson Welles. I guess Plan 9 from Outer Space is just a prime example of how some people will never learn.

Basically, the aliens are upset because we stupid, stupid tellurians don't want to believe in them and they throw a fit with their zombies, ray guns, and wobbly flying saucers.Plan 9 from Outer Space is considered a legendary film not only because its notoriously bad, but because of the countless number of defects and continuity flaws and glaring errors that grace the screen before us as we view it. And this ranges from the special effects, the acting, the editing, the direction, and onward. We have flying saucers (which are just toys mounted on strings) flying in front of backdrops and we see them wobbling on strings, we see them cast shadows on their backgrounds, we see actors reading from cue cards and in one case, from a script in his lap, we see a microphone shadow on the wall behind the actors in plain view, Gregory Walcott refers to his wife's character by the actress's real name, we have constant inter cutting of daytime and nighttime even though the scenes are suppose to take place simultaneously in the same spot, and basically, yeah, you've got a very laughable production. But what's even greater is Bela Lugosi's part in the film. Lugosi had in fact died while making an earlier Wood film called The Ghoul Goes West or something like that, and the film was scrapped until Wood came up with the idea for this film and just spliced in the few seconds he'd shot with Lugosi into it to market it as Lugosi's last movie. Still, there were some parts where they needed a stand-in for Lugosi. So Wood hired his wife's chiropractor, who looked somewhat like Lugosi, and told him to wear the cape over the lower half of his face all the time. So there'll be moments where the cape's not over his face (the real Lugosi) and a split second later, it's back over his face (the chiropractor) and then back again and it becomes painfully obvious. There's even a moment where the cape starts to fall off and the doctor swiftly puts it back over again. And Wood still used the take, because he almost always used the first one.Despite all of these laughable flaws, which you would expect to spur laughter, Plan 9 from Outer Space still turns out to be a dismally dull excuse for a motion picture. Its plot even defies itself when the aliens, who are so desperate to prove their existence, try to cover up the murders they commit. They don't fear us, so what's with that? While watching it, we find ourselves looking at our watches very early on and nothing from that point on keeps us from repeating that. I'll be honest when I say that I turned off the show a third of the way through and watched something else. I actually did that once, a rare thing for me, and then tried again, actually managing to sit through the entire thing the second time around. Looking at Gregory Walcott perform, who reportedly called the script the worst he'd ever read, we get the impression he hated working on the film and I can understand that, because I hated watching the film. Now some fanatics have called Plan 9 a cult classic and described it as being so bad, it's good. Well, I did not enjoy it one bit, it's no classic in any regard, and I would describe it as so bad, it's direful. Looking at Ed Wood's films and knowing his story, I still admire him for his passion as a filmmaker, but surely, in those three years when he was trying to work with that Bela Lugosi footage, he surely could have written a compelling script and asked for a second take every once in a while. Maybe if he'd adjusted his style, he might have made a presentable film and perhaps lived up to his idol, Orson Welles. I guess Plan 9 from Outer Space is just a prime example of how some people will never learn. It's a shame, for if Wood's talent matched his ambition, he might be remembered for something other than just being the Worst Director of All Time.

It was a film that cost Disney 6 million dollars and his most cherished creation that took the entire decade of the 1950's to complete. The result was a beloved and world renowned fairy tale come to epic life on the big screen in Technorama, with amazing sound, color and beautiful music and melodies\/themes lifted from Tchaikovsky's ballet score. It was for the folks at Disney their masterpiece not unlike epic movies that had been impressing audiences by the late 50's to compete with home television - The Ten Commandments, Ben Hur, etc. But the crown is definitely the animation and bold new cinematic look. This brilliant new look was breathtaking for 1959 audiences who had never seen anything like it. It was a kind of animated epic drama or opera. It owed to principal animator Eyvin Earle's stylistic and artsy technique, plus the contributions of great animators like Don Bluth (who would later in the 80's create films like The Land Before Time, etc) and even Chuck Jones who did work for Looney Tunes. Despite following the fairy tale book genre that Disney had done with Snow White and Cinderella, the fairy tale presented in the film is not based on the simplistic original. It is an original Disney re-make of the old and distinctly European tale. Rather than seeing it as a fairy tale, one must see it as being fantasy fiction. Its look borrows from 1400's pre-Renaissance\/Gothic Medieval paintings, Joan of Arc times, Christian and Catholic Europe, coat of arms, embroidery, drapes, banners and architecture. The castles are very European and in fact resemble castles depicted in illustrated manuscripts and even King Ludwig's Neuschwanstein castle in Bavaria, Germany, for which Disney modeled the Disneyland castle in California. Everything is bigger than what it was originally in the tale and it ultimately deals with good versus evil and the protection of an innocent princess by the forces of good from an evil prophecy.

The Three Good Fairies (in primary colors red, green and blue) Flora (Verna Felton), Fauna (Barbara Jo Allen) and the feisty Merriwether (Barbara Luddy) bestow Aurora with blessings and gifts of beauty, grace and song. But the country's outcast fairy, who is in fact an evil sorceress Maleficent, bitter at not being invited and more so for not being wanted takes revenge by cursing Aurora with an evil prophecy On her 16th birthday she will prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and die. Merriwether's gift the reverse spell of putting her to sleep until her true love kisses her. The 3 Fairies take no chances and decide to raise the girl as their own ward in a secluded cottage in the deep woods.

And it's ultimately buried by its insufferable sense of moral and ethical righteousness. How much would it matter in the end if Hayward's character is or is not guilty of the crime? Should she be executed? This is not a question the film asks. In fact Hayward's guilt is never in doubt, which makes the film feel preachy and melodramatic.It's a two hankie picture folks, old school and only pretending to be reasonably sophisticated. It plays to the audience's sympathy in ways that become almost grotesque, parading around the character's infant child like a totem of its own heavy righteousness. Oakland's character is a mere facilitator of the plot and the hints that there might be some fire or drama in his relationship with the Hayward character are not followed through on. The movie has conviction all right, but too much of it. It's hard to get an interesting idea out of a movie that already has such a specific agenda. It's a message picture in the worst possible way, and it leaves no room for ambiguity or dissent.

Not even so much a porn closet or drawer, just a place where things that are too horrible and perverse and maybe just personal are stored away from prying eyes. Certainly it's hard to picture many people putting this in their DVD collections right between say Bad News Bears and Batman. But it could be at least considered a real film, not entirely a porno (though there's enough to classify it such and it has been in some countries), which helps to criticize it as something other than just trash or boring masturbatory material. To be fair to the filmmakers (one a feminist and one a porn star, sounds like a joke but it isn't), it should be treated as a serious movie that would only be masturbatory to the sickest f***s this side of the bowery. That doesn't really mean it's any good though, or enlightening much on the human condition or, you know, giving a good story.If there is any story it's all knock-off, like Thelma and Louise re-written by Frank Miller on a lesser day and filmed by a kid who's just got a digital camera and has watched far too many no-budget exploitation movies. It's simply about two women (both also porn stars, which helps to explain why they go for such explicit sex scenes without question), Madine and Manu, who meet one day when one forced the other by gun point to drive her to the ocean, then the two decide to join together to do... whatever, drive, f***, kill, repeat, rinse maybe, reload, quibble, f*** and kill in bigger-numbered capacities. There's is not a very pleasant trip, nor is it entertaining, but it's hard to say if it's really boring in the way that exploitation movies can be when they are at their worst. If nothing else, it's not I Spit on Your Grave, which most of us can be thankful for.It's also shot with some kind of ugly near-yellow tint giving everything a sickened jaundiced look, and acted by porn actresses who barely know two modes to act Manu is giddy in the most sadistic way or just not giving a damn about what happens to her (rape early on) or how many people she kills (which is a lot, nearing Natural Born Killer numbers by the end I take it), while Nadine is more withdrawn, quiet, an occasional smirk but with less of a real drive to be on this pointless trip except as something to do or be. As it stands Baise-moi today doesn't contain that same shoot-you-in-the-face factor of controversy, but it's also of little philosophical or moral justification either. It's a weak statement done up with plenty of pizazz and punk, it's just gruesome enough for the unapologetic intentions it has. Baise-moi settles to be more than its contemporary women-getting-revenge-on-the-run flicks, but it doesn't settle to push any boundaries for those outside of hardcore pulp audiences. It has its reasons to exist, and I never turned it off, and yet what's the point of telling someone else to watch it? I haven't the slightest, except as a super-flawed semi-interesting entry in killing spree X-rated adventures.

Rising up from his roots as a local rabble-rouser to become the boss of New Orleans' political engine, Stark goes from being a hoped-for savior to being an even more dangerous and corrupt politician than your normal breed of scum. The whole arc of this is observed by one of his closest friends, the journalist Jack Burden (John Ireland) who helps Stark befriend some of the society people in his family circle.One thing that you can't deny is that this film is chock full of outstanding performances, leading off with Crawford's performance which is the best I've seen him give. Ireland is also very good in this movie, being just interesting enough to watch but not to distract from the film's more obvious dynamic characters. Also in the mix is Mercedes McCambridge, playing a disappointed political operative who harbors obsessive love for Stark that doesn't interfere with her canny political judgment. The relationship between Sadie (McCambridge) and Burden is fascinating and fairly unusual.What I didn't like about the film was how things ended up developing into a fairly predictable, almost deus-ex-machina, type of ending. I would have liked to see something develop which includes the Derek character more. Sheppard Strudwick is a kind of starched screen presence and the events surrounding his character played out like standard melodrama. Having Stark assassinated was kind of a cop out I thought. It avoided the need for the characters to actually take responsibility for what had happened, and instead ties things up with a neat bloody bow.Still, it's a worthy film about politics and would form a good counterpoint to Born Yesterday or some of the older Capra films.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"7 March 2009","score":"7 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" This Rocky movie is a rather quick flowing film compared to the first movies and features a bit more comedy while still having drama and inspirational scenes that were pivotal in the first two movies. The fights are different here too, as in this film we do not have the 15 round beat downs of the first films, but rather three rounds of pure hard hitting. In this one we start out with a strange charity match as Rocky the heavyweight champion of boxing goes against the heavyweight champion of wrestling, Thunderlipps (Hulk Hogan in his only decent appearance in a movie, then again it is not really a stretch). This match is rather entertaining and funny, but soon Rocky must face a new challenger to his belt, the very tough Clubber Lang played by a very tough Mr. T. Mickey does not want Rocky to fight this guy as Mickey has seen that Rocky has lost the fire in his eyes that got him the title and would most likely lose to this determined if a bit arrogant new fighter. Well they do end up fighting and Rocky loses and gets hit even worse by the passing of his mentor. Apollo having witnessed the fight and not liking Clubber Lang at all offers to help Rocky train and thus a new friendship is born. The training is nice to watch and I like how Rocky does different strategies against Clubber in the final fight. Sure this movie is a bit more over the top than the previous Rocky movies, it to me is still my favorite.
