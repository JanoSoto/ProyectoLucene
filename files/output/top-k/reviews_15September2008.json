Tingle has been assaulted, threatened, kidnapped, blackmailed and tormented in her own home for numerous days. Don't call the police, this is a matter for the principal.12. Tingle's legally justified retaliation results in nobody getting hurt. The simple question of whats been going on here? is fortunately not raised by anyone ever again and thus all captors are absolved of all crimes.

It won the 1957 film Oscar for Best Foreign Film, and deservedly so. The film deals with the trials and tribulations of the impoverished and downtrodden in a humorous but realistic way that Hollywood still does not dare to do. Yet, even in this film, one can see the filmmaker that Fellini was to become in a few years, for, despite its seeming realism, there are many neat touches of Absurdism, Symbolism, and Surrealism&#133;. In many ways, the film is a picaresque of one of the oldest clichés the hooker with the heart of gold, but such a generalization utterly disservices the 'how' of how art affects one, and how it does its task. Masina's brilliant performance, which won the Best Actress award at the Cannes Film Festival, is often compared to Chaplin's tramp character, even though it is more like Lucille Ball's TV character of Lucy Ricardo, from I Love Lucy, albeit with depth, delicacy, and heart; such a depth of a character that a lesser actress would have let descend into burlesque. Yet, Cabiria's expressiveness is more subtle and true than either Chaplin's or Ball's characters, for they exist only in comedies, and Nights Of Cabiria is not a comedy, despite some funny moments. Cabiria exists in a far more complex and realistic world than the Tramp or Lucy Ricardo. Her face contorts into twists of pain Lucy Ricardo never dreamt of, and which the Tramp simply shrugged off, or responded to with wild slapstick. Cabiria is wary, mistrusts, and does not seem to learn, frustrating both her and the audience she has gotten to root for her. I knew many such women in my New York neighborhood while growing up. And they can be tough, street smart, yet still gullible enough to fall for an Oscar. That said, critics have disagreed, over the years, over whether or not Oscar was conning Cabiria from the start. I think it's clear he was, for from her answers to the mesmerist he felt she was an independent woman of means, assuming a poor woman would never even go to such a show. One can even see from their scene of meeting at the train station that Oscar is putting on an act, changing his facial expressions the moment he sees her, dropping a toothpick from his mouth, after looking like the consummate con man, and then assuming a weak demeanor to lure Cabiria into his trap. That the woman who makes her living in sex is still so naïve to the ways of emotional sexual involvement says a lot of Fellini's prescience in parsing out realities of character development. Then, when he found out she was a prostitute, he felt a bit guilty, as if preying on someone from his own class, and thus wanted to not know of her 'job'. A part of him, it seems, wants to not con her, at the cliff, and this was why his demeanor is so different. Yet, ultimately, he's a con, she's a whore, and reality dictates they act their parts. But, unlike Giorgio, he is no would be killer. The only question is what his initial con was to be- to marry a woman of means, and then, failing that, to just take Cabiria's money the moment he saw it, knowing his original plan was dead, for he could not sponge off of her. Such small ambiguities, even if not pertinent to Cabiria's ultimate unhappiness, nor the film's ending, makes Fellini an artist of the first rank, for only such artists pay attention to such things. These things, not the great things, are often the difference between greats and minor artists.These sorts of subtleties in common folk are never even broached, much less dealt with, in modern Hollywood films. Such is the richness of this marvelous study in class and self-deception, where humans live in small concrete boxes they call homes, as if lab rats. That the film does not follow a conventional narrative format is a good thing, for it heightens the realistic sense of the film. It also subtly repudiates religion, although not so much in the overtly religious scenes, where Cabiria's spiritual entreaties go unheard, nor where she mocks the religiots as fools, but in those scenes where Cabiria reveals her most human side, the non-fantastic, which is ironic, since she works in a profession that deals with fantasy. The film also deals with survival, at its basest level, for Cabiria barely grows intellectually through the film. Yes, by film's end, one could argue that her latest user and abuser, Oscar, is a step up from Giorgio, whom she began the film with, but has Cabiria really ameliorated?To close, Nights Of Cabiria owes much to City Lights for its focus on the poor, as well as to De Sica's The Bicycle Thief, for its realistic view of life at a certain time and place, especially its end, which simply ends, with no indication of whether or not Cabiria will be better off or not, and this helps viewers more strongly identify with her, because we all are unknowing and uncertain of our futures, and even though Cabiria's uncertainty is half a century removed, the tingle we get in our bellies, at the film's end is a recognition of our fears in her gaze toward us, and despite it's unsettling effect, such butterflies still flap their wings for the future.

Miles away in California, my future friend Marshall was aching to see the film, only to be dragged to a free presentation of 'The Donna Shore Show', with his parents. This scared him deeply. I helped to heal this scar by letting him finally watch the film he avoided for so many years because of Donna Shore. After he finally he got to watch just a little of it, he concluded that he really didn't miss all that much.Is my friend right? I want to point out a few of the flaws of the film and compare them to the 2003 remake as best as I can remember it. There was also a 1995 remake with Shelly Long I never saw and will leave alone. First there is the way in which the Freaky Friday switch happens. In the remake, there is some magic charm from some fortune teller that causes mother and daughter to switch places. In the original it happens because the script says it does. Fantasy Phenomenon does not always need an explanation especially when the film is more or less a parable, but the film makes more sense in the remake.The second thing is there is no real interaction on screen between the mother and the daughter. You would think if something weird happened like switching bodies with someone you would want to talk about it with other person, but this never happens. It does happen in the remake which is very logical and believable. I always have a hard time accepting the actors in a body switching movie. I usually can't buy a adult playing a kid and vice versa. 13 going on 30 seemed to be the most successful attempt I have seen at it. I also usually feel this way when men try to discuses themselves as women. As funny as it is, it is still Dustin Hoffman and Robin Williams in drag and I can tell. Charlie Chaplin actually did make a very convincing woman.This brings me to the last major flaw which is the believability of some of the action. I find it hard to believe that a 13 year old wouldn't know how to run a washer and that a grown women wouldn't' know how to run an electric typewriter especially when other adults know how to do the same thing. The lack of believability usually kills a film but not this one. There is a logical explanation for every action in the film. Every thing that happens in the film happens simply for yucks. And by some stroke of Disney magic it works. Towards the end of the film, one character remarks, Your whole family is a bunch of comedians. That seems to ring through in this film. The wacky silliness works much the same way a Marx Bros. film works. The crazy things that happen are so odd, unusual, and well timed that their funny. A funny scene has the daughter at home in the mom's body thinking she will just watch TV and eat snacks, only to have every Tom, Dick, and Harriot come to the house for some reason or other. Rugs, Groceries, House Cleaning est. The ending chase scene would make Buster Keaton proud. It's also neat to see how 70's everything is.If you want even a half way decent thinking comic fantasy, this is not your film. There are plenty of other films with the same fantasy element that covers that category. If you want a nice family friendly no brainer wacky comedy that will entertain the kids this is your film. It's worth a place in the family library right along side your Marx Bros. comedies. In reality this does not compare to the genius of their work, but it's fun to watch and so are the Marx's and you should introduce your kids to them at some point like my did to me.

Miles away in California, my future friend Marshall was aching to see the film, only to be dragged to a free presentation of 'The Donna Shore Show', with his parents. This scared him deeply. I helped to heal this scar by letting him finally watch the film he avoided for so many years because of Donna Shore. After he finally he got to watch just a little of it, he concluded that he really didn't miss all that much.Is my friend right? I want to point out a few of the flaws of the film and compare them to the 2003 remake as best as I can remember it. There was also a 1995 remake with Shelly Long I never saw and will leave alone. First there is the way in which the Freaky Friday switch happens. In the remake, there is some magic charm from some fortune teller that causes mother and daughter to switch places. In the original it happens because the script says it does. Fantasy Phenomenon does not always need an explanation especially when the film is more or less a parable, but the film makes more sense in the remake.The second thing is there is no real interaction on screen between the mother and the daughter. You would think if something weird happened like switching bodies with someone you would want to talk about it with other person, but this never happens. It does happen in the remake which is very logical and believable. I always have a hard time accepting the actors in a body switching movie. I usually can't buy a adult playing a kid and vice versa. 13 going on 30 seemed to be the most successful attempt I have seen at it. I also usually feel this way when men try to discuses themselves as women. As funny as it is, it is still Dustin Hoffman and Robin Williams in drag and I can tell. Charlie Chaplin actually did make a very convincing woman.This brings me to the last major flaw which is the believability of some of the action. I find it hard to believe that a 13 year old wouldn't know how to run a washer and that a grown women wouldn't' know how to run an electric typewriter especially when other adults know how to do the same thing. The lack of believability usually kills a film but not this one. There is a logical explanation for every action in the film. Every thing that happens in the film happens simply for yucks. And by some stroke of Disney magic it works. Towards the end of the film, one character remarks, Your whole family is a bunch of comedians. That seems to ring through in this film. The wacky silliness works much the same way a Marx Bros. film works. The crazy things that happen are so odd, unusual, and well timed that their funny. A funny scene has the daughter at home in the mom's body thinking she will just watch TV and eat snacks, only to have every Tom, Dick, and Harriot come to the house for some reason or other.

Great movies create an unforgettable sensual atmosphere while telling good stories. There is no more sensual art than film-making. Films can create distinctive moods. Moods that stay with you for days, weeks, months, years. In a recent review, I discussed the eerie atmosphere of CT Dreyer's visual masterpiece Vampyr. That spurred me to revisit another masterpiece of mood.Peter Weir's Picnic at Hanging Rock is one of the most memorable films I have ever seen. First, it tells a frustratingly intriguing story. On Valentines Day 1900, a group of Australian private schoolgirls go on an outing to Victoria's hanging rock. While exploring the rocks, three girls vanish into thin air after walking hypnotically onto a pathway. Another girl, terrified, runs away. On her way down she claims she saw one of their teachers, without her skirt, going up the rocks. She, too, disappears. It is not really a spoiler to divulge that the teacher and 2 of the 3 girls are never seen again. Not even a trace. The third girl is found a week later, alive but with no memory of the incident. The second reason why this film is so memorable, and the reason that elevates its subject matter, is the mood that Weir creates. He and his cinematographer capture the story in lush, dream like photography. They often used the simple trick of placing a bridal veil in front of the camera to shoot though, making the picture hazy and dreamish. The actors, particularly the school girls at the rock, move with a slow, meandering gait, as if hypnotized or drawn to something not even they understand. Another key to the mood and atmosphere of the film is the music. It is constantly ominous, but not simply by itself. The camera movements, the picture, the choreography of actors and the music all work together. It's this combination that creates the film's awesomely eerie atmosphere.And of course, Hanging Rock itself. If ever a natural landscape existed for the sole purpose of filming a movie, it is hanging rock. It is terrorizing in its odd beauty. It, along with the rest of the physical elements in the film, feel threatening at all times. When two young men, who saw the girls the day they disappeared, search the rock for any signs, one is nearly claimed by the rocks. (An interesting note, a few people have recently pointed out to me that the cuts and marks on this boy, and the cuts and marks found on the found girl are nearly identical - perhaps a hint to the films mystery?) It is that mood which has never left me.Obviously, the story in Picnic at Hanging Rock, based on the novel, struck and continues to strike a sour note with audiences. Especially today. Understandable. People naturally want answers. However, I've always been a firm believer that what is imagined is always more terrifying, more interesting than what is presented. Just as the aliens in Signs were far scarier when they were left off screen or in blurred or shadowy images, just as the monster in Cloverfield was more interesting and intimidating before we got a clear look at it, Picnic at Hanging Rock retains it's elusive fascination through its ambiguity. The story also deals with a number of subtle and not so subtle themes. Sexuality is one example. The main character (although she has only about 1\/2 hour of screen time) is the object of quite possibly a lesbian crush - Sarah, an orphan. She becomes the major focus of attention after the disappearance, along with Mrs Appleyard, the brutish schoolmarm, growing ever more distressed in the aftermath of the disappearances.Picnic at Hanging Rock is not an unforgettable film simply the reasons I have discussed here, but because of the way they all work together to create such a creepy and threatening atmosphere. It is the perfect example of the old adage 'the sum is more than the parts.'

The film introduce to us a man in love with something, with the opera, since always he had one clear goal, one clear dream, something that will make him look like a complete insane man, like a visionary and always like a dreamer. Again we have the encounter of different worlds. Here is clear that the people from the old continent are having all the success however Brian Fitzcarraldo Fitzgerald (Klaus Kinski) is still looking out for that road to the success. He is in the ice business, he left incomplete another visionary project and basically at one point he is seen as a complete madman when he tries to share what the opera makes with him. He is an eccentric character, he is a businessman and a visionary who will do what nobody ever imagine if there is a hope to get what he wants to get what he needs for that dream, for that opera house. On that way his dream will stay intact but the way to get what he needs will change until the mission is clear, not clear in ways of how successful it will be but clear in the mind of Fitzcarraldo. Everything seems great for the team that will join our main character in his journey however not a long time after they began to have questions, actually the first questions began right after the steamer took its way. The fear is the only thing Fitzcarraldo can represent to his team and not because he is an evil man or something but because he is doing something that nobody has done.

The movie lacks focus - as if the director tried sending out too many signals, too many messages, and they all feel too jumbled to strike home.

Half the movie is spent tiptoeing through the Zone, the viewer waiting for *something* to happen but it never does. The stalker seemed like a madman who believed in invisible ghosts - a simple sewer pipe becomes the mince-meater and according to him, it claimed many visitors but it boggles the mind how it possibly could.

It's basically a parody of the James Bond and Our Man Flint movies. If you've seen either or both of the other Powers movies, you know the storyline to this one Austin (Mike Myers) is a secret agent (!) working to rid the world of its megalomaniacal nemesis Dr. Evil (Myers), who has various bizarre world domination machinations and is aided by Bond-style gizmos, a round table of dopey assistants, and other evil-doing secret agents (also Myers). Just think of a simple-minded Bond storyline and throw in '60s slang, haute couture, and bad teeth, with a heaping helping of potty jokes and double entendres, and a cast with the looks of the United Nations of Circus Freaks (with the thankful exception of the sexy female secret agents Powers partners with). Without the babes (Heather Graham, here--is it me, or do those eyes make her look like a doll? She makes me randy, baby. Yeah!... Oh, and there's a way-too-brief cameo by Rebecca Romijn-Stamos in this one.) and Dr. Evil's ever-changing schemes, these movies would be totally repetitious. Basically, since there's so little variation in these movies, this review could apply to all. I recently purchased this and after watching it (and having seen it at the theatre) I noticed how many jokes have been recycled throughout this series. If you've only seen the latest, Goldmember, you've seen many of the same jokes as the first two. Which is not all bad, but it does become somewhat predictable and tedious. Although, each of the movies does have its share of original jokes, many of which are downright hilarious and make the movies worthwhile. Kudos has to be given to Myers for his effort. He's hilarious and has an under-appreciated talent in playing so many distinct characters in the series. The Dr. Evil character, especially, is the one in which the actor disappears. He created the characters and has made a fortune from it. If you liked the others, you'll like this one. If you haven't seen the others and you like dumb plots, silly costumes and makeup, silly dancing, silly humour, double entendres, and potty jokes, (or if you're a 12 year old boy) you'll like this.

Then she returns and wants her son back. She's rich now. Voight has to become a boxer again to provide for his kid...but it might kill him. OK--it's well acted (all three leads are great) and well-done but man is it SYRUPY! The movie is just so cloying and sweet that I started to get annoyed watching it. Also the story is old and has been done many times before. You know how it's going to end. And yeah--I cried at the end but how could you not?

When one looks at the list of great films in Lumet's career 12 Angry Men, Long Day's Journey Into Night, Fail-Safe, Serpico, Murder On The Orient Express, Dog Day Afternoon, and a handful of others, one marvels, not only at what he accomplished, but that he's spent a quarter-century having churned out nothing but mediocrity since 1982's The Verdict. Yet, of all the films in his canon, perhaps the best, and certainly the most complex, was 1976's Network- the greatest black comedy this side of Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove, Or How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love the Bomb. It was to corporate America what Strangelove was to the military industrial complex.Written by the nonpareil Paddy Chayefsky, Network is not only a prescient film, but still a cogent one, as remarkable as that claim seems. Whereas many films from the years in between its release and now have dated badly, the same cannot be said of Network. Like other visionary films, from Metropolis to The Trial, Network not only crafted a world unto itself, but a world that, in large part, has seen its day realize. Yes, there are no PC's on the desks of the network stooges, but other than that, the depiction of corporate America's deadly vapidity, its whoring of life and death and war and suffering into mere commodities, has all come true. Reality TV has shown that the only thing that Chayefsky's and Lumet's film has not yet seen come true is the assassination on live television that closes the film. This oddly vatic quality raises the question of whether the film can even rightly be called a satire. Perhaps a prophecy is closer to the mark, especially in how the fictive fourth network, UBS (Union Broadcasting Systems), so closely resembles the real current fourth network, then a decade from its creation, FOX.The tale is one that seems not so outlandish any longer- Howard Beale (Peter Finch), widowed, depressed, and alcoholic network news anchorman for the UBS Evening News, has learnt that he will be fired due to low ratings. Beale's producer and friend, Max Schumacher (William Holden) informs him of this, and this seems to be the final straw for Beale, who glibly announces his impending retirement, and that he will also suicide on next week's show. Few techs in the studio are even paying attention until one of them who was freaks out. Network bigwigs freak out, yet there is never a sense of real overacting- save, perhaps for Finch's role. This is why the film is so devastating, for Chayefsky and Lumet were intimately involved with network politics from the earliest days of television, and drew from their decades of experience to couch craziness in acceptability&#133;. If Network is not a great film it is certainly, as Lumet mantras in his commentary, a prescient one. It is also proof that, despite what naysayers and masturbatory French cineastes might think, film is a writer's medium, first and foremost, not a visual one, for Network shows that greatness is possible sans special effects and virtually no music- the film is void of a formal score. This lack, however, only heightens the realistic acidity of Chayefsky's brilliant and funny words, which transcend satire and enter reportage, at times. Just watch the scene where Schumacher finally leaves Christensen, and ask yourself how much more powerful is that scene without a swelling musical crescendo, not to mention Chayefsky's having Holden narrate his own exit, stage right? Go ahead, try to name me a film that reaches greatness in the other direction- with just special effects and music, and no screenplay of merit. Lo!I recommend especially anyone under the age of thirty-five to watch this film, and they will see just how predictable the current lowest common denominator state of affairs, domestically and abroad, in the media and in day to day affairs, was, even decades in coming.

This has played out not only internationally, with the rise of terrorism, but domestically, with the mute acceptance of corruption and civil rights infringements by the scared masses, as well as a refusal by the general electorate to refuse to vote for crooks and bums for elective office. Thus, the fictive raving idiots that shouted their madness, along with Howard Beale, back then are now railing in reality, on cable TV and in the blogosphere, now. And still no one is worried, and there's no Chayefsky around to skewer the idiocy.

The story is as simple as could be imagined, deceptively so, as there are layered undercurrents running all through it. And 'simple' is a good way to describe the main character, Marshal Will Kane. One might even say 'simple-minded.' He doesn't have much to say, he's not good at explaining himself, but he is dogged and courageous. The people of the small town where he has served for a long time are generally appreciative of the fact that many years past, Kane 'cleaned up' the town and made it safe for women to walk the streets, etc. But there are others, like the saloonkeeper and the hotel owner, who still harbor resentment and feel he drove away business when he got rid of the bad guys. Kane is no longer a young man and as it turns out, on the day he retires and gets married, he discovers the baddest bad guy of them all, Frank Miller, has been released from prison and is heading back to town on the noon train. Everyone urges Kane to take his bride and get out of town before Miller arrives. Some are genuinely concerned for his safety, others hope that with Kane gone, a deadly confrontation will be avoided. Kane starts to leave, then turns around and comes back. His conscience won't allow him to flee. He determines to face Miller no matter what anyone else thinks. He tries to recruit deputies but no one will stand with him. The townspeople convince themselves, in different ways, that Miller is no threat to them if Kane leaves. Even Kane's bride refuses to stay with him. When the final showdown arrives, it's just Kane against Miller and three of his gunmen. With a last-minute assist from his recalcitrant bride, Kane prevails, then throws his badge on the ground in disgust. The basic idea (which seems pretty clear to me) of 'High Noon' is that of a man willing to give his life to protect a town whose residents are convinced that they are safer by not fighting back against evil. Eventually, no matter each one's initial motivation, they come to the same conclusion they must, in effect, capitulate to Frank Miller by refusing to help Will Kane. Now what on earth this has to do with McCarthyism, I cannot fathom. As I understand it, McCarthyism means smearing innocent people with untrue charges, blacklisting them and so forth. There is nothing of the sort in 'High Noon' and I frankly feel it is a silly comparison. But there is a curious modernity to much of what happens in the film, such as the moment in church when one of the 'leading citizens' stands up to defend Will Kane, offering a tribute of sorts to Kane's bravery, then suggests the town no longer needs his kind of help. The real message that comes across is that even the most well-meaning citizens in town have turned cowardly, and are no longer willing to fight to preserve and protect what they claim to cherish. They did once; it is suggested that all those years ago, the townspeople rose up against the hooligans, behind Marshal Kane. But they won't do it again. Gary Cooper brings a great deal of battered dignity to the role of Will Kane. He has very little dialogue; his facial expressions tell much of the story. He carries the air of a man who has been doing one thing for so long, he doesn't really know how to do anything else. He's not motivated by thoughts of heroism or rewards, but he would rather disagree with an entire town of people he knows, even his new wife, rather than shirk his duty. Grace Kelly plays his wife with great charm and beauty as always. There's quite a supporting cast in 'High Noon' as well, and it includes Lloyd Bridges, Lon Chaney Jr., Thomas Mitchell, and Lee Van Cleef.

He tries to recruit deputies but no one will stand with him. The townspeople convince themselves, in different ways, that Miller is no threat to them if Kane leaves. Even Kane's bride refuses to stay with him. When the final showdown arrives, it's just Kane against Miller and three of his gunmen. With a last-minute assist from his recalcitrant bride, Kane prevails, then throws his badge on the ground in disgust. The basic idea (which seems pretty clear to me) of 'High Noon' is that of a man willing to give his life to protect a town whose residents are convinced that they are safer by not fighting back against evil. Eventually, no matter each one's initial motivation, they come to the same conclusion they must, in effect, capitulate to Frank Miller by refusing to help Will Kane. Now what on earth this has to do with McCarthyism, I cannot fathom. As I understand it, McCarthyism means smearing innocent people with untrue charges, blacklisting them and so forth. There is nothing of the sort in 'High Noon' and I frankly feel it is a silly comparison. But there is a curious modernity to much of what happens in the film, such as the moment in church when one of the 'leading citizens' stands up to defend Will Kane, offering a tribute of sorts to Kane's bravery, then suggests the town no longer needs his kind of help. The real message that comes across is that even the most well-meaning citizens in town have turned cowardly, and are no longer willing to fight to preserve and protect what they claim to cherish. They did once; it is suggested that all those years ago, the townspeople rose up against the hooligans, behind Marshal Kane. But they won't do it again. Gary Cooper brings a great deal of battered dignity to the role of Will Kane. He has very little dialogue; his facial expressions tell much of the story. He carries the air of a man who has been doing one thing for so long, he doesn't really know how to do anything else. He's not motivated by thoughts of heroism or rewards, but he would rather disagree with an entire town of people he knows, even his new wife, rather than shirk his duty. Grace Kelly plays his wife with great charm and beauty as always.

The story is as simple as could be imagined, deceptively so, as there are layered undercurrents running all through it. And 'simple' is a good way to describe the main character, Marshal Will Kane. One might even say 'simple-minded.' He doesn't have much to say, he's not good at explaining himself, but he is dogged and courageous. The people of the small town where he has served for a long time are generally appreciative of the fact that many years past, Kane 'cleaned up' the town and made it safe for women to walk the streets, etc. But there are others, like the saloonkeeper and the hotel owner, who still harbor resentment and feel he drove away business when he got rid of the bad guys. Kane is no longer a young man and as it turns out, on the day he retires and gets married, he discovers the baddest bad guy of them all, Frank Miller, has been released from prison and is heading back to town on the noon train. Everyone urges Kane to take his bride and get out of town before Miller arrives. Some are genuinely concerned for his safety, others hope that with Kane gone, a deadly confrontation will be avoided.

I was a child from the 80's, and remember these movies well, and I also remember back in the day everyone thinking that the future would be exactly like this movie portrayed it to be like. It wasn't, at least not *yet* in the year 2007 (in the movie, they go to the year 2015, so unless some major changes happen in the next eight years, all those flying vehicles and life-like television screens will probably not be happening in our reality any time soon). It was just a lot of fun to sit there and think that back in the 80's, people really thought our world was going to change THAT drastically. Lots of fun scenes. Anyway, I haven't seen the second movie in quite a long time, and was surprised that the quality of the storytelling has held up extremely well through the years, and the movie doesn't look like your typical 80's film either (you know, with lots of dated-sounding loud saxophone playing, yuck!) I was also surprised that the characters actually went back to the year 1955 for quite a long time. Talk about telling a story with lots of twists and turns. Awesome! These are seriously some of the most exciting movies that have ever existed. The first movie is a classic, and the third one is really good as well, even though many people point to the third movie as being the obvious weakpoint in the series. Maybe, maybe not. I don't really know. I just know I love these films and wanted to comment on how well they've held up after all this time. A series of movies that are worth watching over and over again, and I normally only watch movies once or twice. Not in this case.

Howard, who ended his prolific career by a self-inflicted gunshot to the head in 1936. This movie is based on the memoirs of a woman he was involved with named Novalyn Price. So again to be up front, this movie is very pleasing to me as a fan of Bob Howard. It reveals some of the negative aspects of this man (although skimming clear of his extreme racist views, which to be fair he tended to show more in his writing than in his personal behavior) but also shows us a lot of his heart and the beauty of his writer's soul that always found such tortured expression in the famous Conan and Solomon Kane stories. But I think the movie is going to be just as pleasing to those who are not fans of Howard's writing -- perhaps even more so, because this isn't really a movie just about a writer, it's about a relationship between two writers. And it's a messy, very realistic relationship at that.This was a very early film for Renee Zellweger, and I was impressed right away with the ability she shows here in this film. None of her subsequent and often acclaimed performances have matched what she did here, opposite the great character actor Vincent D'Onofrio who brings Howard himself to vivid life. The movie is all about these 2 people -- there are no action scenes, there is no real drama except a manufactured drama that Bob Howard creates to compensate for his inadequacy and lack of resolve. There are many powerful scenes where these 2 people are consumed in an atmosphere of natural beauty, which suggests the world of imagination inside these writers -- Novalyn says from the hillside you can see the whole wide world from up here and Howard says other worlds, too. Always the sense of what Bob Howard's imaginary world could look like is bubbling beneath the surface of what we see -- never do the film-makers stoop to any actual visualization of the fantasy universe, but sound effects and music are effectively used to create that sense of his dangerous and exotic fantasy world, while at the same time there is an emptiness around Novalyn's literary aspirations which contrasts with it. There are always two stories battling here -- a love story between two human beings and a sort of journey in stasis between two writers.There's no way to put into precise words just how incredible I think D'Onofrio's performance is here. Again, as a longtime fan of Bob Howard, I can say that the performance matches my image of him down to the smallest physical mannerisms. As a treat for fans we even get to see Bob in his late phase when he wore a sombrero and liked to walk the streets of El Paso disguised as a Mexican. All of Bob's paranoia and his contradictions are on display, and even more fascinating when put into the light of day by dramatic action -- he was a man whose ego demanded absolute self-sufficiency, but who had such deep emotional ties to his small circle of family and friends that he was unable to cope with any kind of loss in his life. The manufactured drama when Bob finds out that Novalyn is dating his friend Truett is just one of the more harmless examples of this, but Novalyn's perspective as expressed in the film enables us to see how deeply Bob Howard's behavior must have hurt and alienated the very people he needed and trusted so deeply. The pain and confusion are brilliantly expressed in Zellweger's performance, and there are also a pair of excellent supporting performances from Ann Wedgeworth and Harve Presnell as the Howard parents.This is a beautiful film, this is a film that has a world of emotion while having absolutely no stylized or melodramatic plot devices to push us one way or the other in our feelings -- it just unfolds at the pace of its story and draws us in to the lives of 2 people in a particular place and time. They are people who don't seem to fit -- a big awkward hulk of a fantasy writer whose hard working Texan neighbors think he's a sissy, and a headstrong woman trying to make a career for herself in the same conservative universe. But through the eye of this cinematic gem, they both seem to belong in this time and place and we feel as if they left a bit of their hearts behind in their writings so that we could discover it with them.

For some reason they showed Exorcist 2 first and I started to fear the worst, was this any indication of what the Exorcist was like? I needn't have worried. The Exorcist blew me away and when my friend and I emerged from the cinema, into the cold night, he eventually admitted to me that the real reason he didn't want to see it again was because it had terrified him that much that he hadn't slept for weeks. I felt guilty for dragging him to see it again. Years later we watched it again on video for old times sake. Not long after this Jim committed suicide with no warning or indication. I miss him and every time I watch The Exorcist I think of him. So apart from being one of the best films ever made it also holds a special place in my heart. ","genre":"Horror"}]
