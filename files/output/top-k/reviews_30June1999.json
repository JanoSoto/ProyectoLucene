This might have been intentional, as the purpose probably was to shock the audience with the full horrors of war.Still this scene doesn't do it for me. Why? Because I've read so much about the D-Day and WWII that I know people died in droves (literally) on the beaches that day, such as they always do in war, only this was on a much greater scale. That same scale what is working against the scene because we don't know the characters involved and we do know that those we recognise(Tom Sizemore and Tom Hanks for instance) will make it safely ashore as they have to go and find this paratrooper schmuck named Ryan. It is a good scene though, just not all that it was claimed to be.Ok, ok, I've rambled on about the landing, how about the rest of the film? Well, it starts off a bit slow, to allow the audience to get their breaths back from the opening 20 minute blood bath and to introduce the main characters to the audience. We are also introduced to the films moral dilemma, is it fair to risk the lives of nine men to save one, just because his three brothers have already died? What price are we prepared to pay and for what exactly are we willing to pay that price? The message is further emphasized by the losses incurred on our small group of heroes as they traverse the French countryside. The whole mission seems like a suicide, especially as nobody knows wether Ryan is still alive at all!And it's the final battle scene that really makes the movie for me. Because now it's man to man, you know the characters involved and you can see the fear in their eyes, and you can see the same fear in the germans' eyes.So it's really gritty and intense, and Spielberg has managed to capture all this with a really stunning and up-close photo. The cinematics are incredible, the shots are long with few cuts, just like in the old David Lean movies (Lawrence of Arabia, most notably). All this combines into one, long and really breathtaking battle. It would probably have been easier to start a real war and film that one instead than to shoot this battle scene. When I came out of the theater, my condition could only be described as shell-shocked.Sadly, this is a movie which will lose a lot if seen on a TV. But see it anyway if you haven't seen it yet.

LIMBO is one of the best movies I've seen this year, with all the usual Sayles virtues; complex themes, intelligence, three-dimensional characters, believable dialogue, and excellent use of location.  Within the first five minutes of the film, I was laughing not just at the humor(people who say Sayles is without humor are missing something) but in recognition of the real people who occupy the screen.Sayles movies tend towards two types; his ensemble movies(RETURN OF THE SECAUCUS SEVEN, MATEWAN, EIGHT MEN OUT, CITY OF HOPE, LONE STAR) and stories which follow only a few people(LIANNA, PASSION FISH, THE SECRET OF ROAN INISH).  LIMBO starts out as if it's an ensemble film, but gradually turns into the second type by narrowing its focus to just three characters; Joe(David Strathairn), the handyman with a dark past, Donna(Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), the road-weary singer, and Noelle(Vanessa Martinez), her resentful daughter, when they get stuck in the Alaskan wild.

I really wish now I'd seen it in the theater, I still liked it on video but it's one of those 'popcorn' movies. I took stars away for it's shamelessly ripping off The Thing, one of the ten best horror films ever made (in my opinion that is) and one I've seen over a dozen times. The take-the-test-to-make-sure-the monster-isn't-you scene and the severed head spouting legs and running around, spider-like, are right out of that movie (and so is the character's 'what the f---?' line when he sees it). But if you're going to steal, steal from the best. I also am not the biggest Kevin Williamson fan in the world, maybe because I'm not in my 20's anymore and I find his aren't-I-clever pop-culture references painful. But those are minor points. I've seen most of the stuff he scripted and this is his best--much more unpredictable. Unfortunately I figured out who the Queen alien was before it happened, because I read a semi-spoiler. But in the scene (the one ripped off from the thing) where all the characters are alone in a room and one-by-one are tested to see if they have the monster in them, the last one I expected turned out to be the monster. I'm pretty good at guessing plot twists, so I liked that. Also, I don't think this movie would have been as fun or enjoyable without Robert Rocket Rodriguez directing. He just kicks ass. The scenes with the fireworks going off at the football game were beautifully shot, and the monster scenes were also fantastic, especially the shot in the locker room where the monster barrels after the kid and whole banks of lockers go flying through the air. The swimming pool scene was also pretty impressive. Also, maybe it wasn't original compared to, say, older horror films such as Re-Animator and The Thing, but compared to most of the teen horror film s--t that has been put out recently that has been so trendy, this is much more original.

","genre":"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"30 June 1999","score":"","review":" What was it like to have had the fortune or misfortune, as the case maybe,of meeting Beethoven, of being in his inner circle.Bernard Rose, the director of this movie, gives his audience a glimpse of the private life of Beethoven.His joys, pain tragedy,hopes and desires.It is a credit to Rose that this remains largely historically accurate and faithfully documents episodes in Beethoven's life, while very, very cleverly inserting a premise that drives the plot along.What surprised me most was two things. One, every element of this movie, from the acting,flashbacks, elaborate locations, ornate costuming and exceptional photography was well integrated and developed as a whole.This is not a chronological account of Beethoven's life but rather a pastiche centered around the plot.Two,the acting was superb, not just the main players,Oldman,Krabbe,Rossalini and Golini.But the minor roles especially Johanna Der Steege showed great skill in their portrayals.Two small but important scenes demonstrate the sheer emotive quality of the film. In one scene, towards the end of Beethoven's life, a visitor pays him a call.A document is signed and handed over,a question is written down and its reply given, also on paper.The visitor solemnly leaves. This electrically charged linchpin scene is extraordinary when you realize what's gone before.

It is a great version of the show, only it's Bigger, Longer and (somewhat) Uncut.  It had a lot of humor that wouldn't be for everyone though.  If you're easily offended, then don't go see this, because it picks on just about everybody.  It was very artistic, the construction paper looks excellent on the big screen, and even though it's animated, it has some great special effects, especially Kenny's trip to Hell, and the Hell sequences in general.  The fire mixed very well with the animation. The musical numbers were mostly great, but they could have done without the Saddam Hussein song or the Satan song.  The rest were really funny.  The Saddam\/Satan thing got kind of old, but Kenny giving advice to Satan was good.  There are a lot of hidden and in jokes for fans of the show. Lots and lots of profanity.  And you finally get to see Kenny's face and hear his voice sans hood.  I'm still trying to decide if that was a good move or not. A GREAT cameo by George Clooney.  I recommend this movie for anyone with a strong stomach and a good sense of humor.  8\/10 stars. ","genre":null},{"date":"30 June 1999","score":"","review":"  I loved this movie.

What was so interesting about it, though, was that the true horror of the movie (disregarding the ending, which I simply could not watch the first time) is totally understated, yet there the whole time.  The horror comes with the audience knowing what's happening, what really is going on with the neighbors and with Rosemary's demise, and not being able to do a thing about it.  In its own way, this movie is incredibly tense and nerve-racking.  It's the ultimate last word in I have a bad feeling about this movies.  Roman Polanski is great at creating that underlying horror -- I can't even THINK about the opening and closing music without a shiver.  The music in general was effective, and the direction, especially the dream sequence, was dark and very Polanski-esque.  The acting was good, understated, exactly what the movie called for.  So much scarier than any of the teen horror movies out lately. ","genre":null},{"date":"30 June 1999","score":"","review":"  This movie truly frightened me.
