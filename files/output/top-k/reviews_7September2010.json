[{"date":"7 September 2010","score":"","review":" To start with, very few actresses could have successfully delivered such a performance as Cate Blanchett's as Elizabeth I and driven it with, at times, such charismatic playfulness and, conversely, such avid passion and cold seriousness. Blanchett makes for an excellent Queen Elizabeth I, with perhaps her most astonishing achievement being her ability to portray the unrelenting and often overwhelming insecurity that inundated the young ruler which, instead of becoming annoyingly dreary, hits the right note and makes the audience sympathetic towards her plight, justifying her nomination for Best Actress, the very first of many Oscar nods.Balanced against Blanchett is Geoffrey Rush as the mysterious and daring figure Walsingham, a somewhat villain that the audience instantly can get behind as the philosophical anti-hero, eventually arising to the esteemed position of the Queen's personal assassin and adviser. His pivotal role and performance is undermined by a severe lack of presence, though he does a damn good job with what he's given.Joseph Fiennes is charming and sexily poetic as Elizabeth's illegitimate lover Robert Dudley. Whether portraying the Queen's lover or playwright (as he did in the 1998 Best Picture Shakespeare In Love, also starring Geoffrey Rush oddly enough) Fiennes has a remarkable quality to make every line demand the viewer's attention simply because his words can cause the most rigid person to melt before him.Christopher Eccleston, a man perhaps best (or most vaguely) described as a subtler John Malkovich, has few true moments of his own, but his restraint and silently calculating demeanour produce a constantly scheming Duke of Norfolk. His many attempts to orchestrate Elizabeth's death for the entirety of the film ultimately result in his execution, due to the betrayal of his servant\/lover. Eccleston has created such an airtight antagonist that, even at this, his most pitiable, the audience finds it impossible to pity him.Kathy Burke's unfortunately small interjection as the eerily desperate Mary I also deserved far more recognition than it received.Finally, silver-screen veteran Richard Attenborough as Sir William, one of Elizabeth's closest advisers, is gently touching as the under-appreciated voice of reason. In one scene, Elizabeth declares that she will now follow only her own opinion and rebukes William for stating that she is only a woman, saying that she has the heart of a man, she is her father's daughter and she is not afraid of anything. William asks contritely for forgiveness and assures Elizabeth that his advice has always been in her best interests, struggling with tears concurrently with the viewer. It is revitalizing to see that true icons never really lose the power to move their audiences in such a way.The script's course (which focuses heavily on the brutal conflict between the Catholics and Protestants in England, squabbles that seem ridiculous now but echo the current religious biases in the world to a tee) unfolds with the unraveling of a mass conspiracy against the titled hero, as well as her efforts to do what is necessary in order to reign as Queen discard her childish naivety and fear of the unknown and become a ruthless, impersonally merciless and dedicated woman. This route is defined and traveled quite comfortably with all the information of a documentary\/biography and all the appeal of a splendid drama\/epic tale.The score, composed by David Hirschfelder, is mostly a mixture of string-oriented melodies, fiddle and pipe jigs and church-choir accompaniments. The beauty of many of Hirschfelder's pieces is complemented by Alexandra Byrne's dedicated costumes and Remi Adefarasin's intimate scenery shots as photography director, though there is some clunky and irreverent editing on Jill Bilcock's behalf (witness Cate Blanchett's miraculous movement from the chair to the mirror, in mid-sentence, without taking a breath!)Director Shekhar Kapur has an apt eye for the continuation of scenes that sometimes are too long but remain of interest because of his considerate touch. If he has committed any true misstep in the making of Elizabeth, it is his constant focus on the affair between Elizabeth and Dudley, which seems adequate enough we realise that it's more fun to watch them quarrel. Still, Kapur has some especially triumphant moments in this film, from the immediately compelling opening, in which three Protestant martyrs are burned alive, to what is a moving, albeit brief, love scene between Elizabeth and Dudley, and of course the powerful 20 second homage to the entire film just before the conclusion.Elizabeth, while promising, is not a perfect film, which is a genuine shame as period pieces have become such common ground these days that it would be nice to find one that attains such status. It is worth noting that Michael Hirst's semi-faithful screenplay is, if you reduce Elizabeth's script down to its very base, often concerned with tedious yet necessary and, at times, uninteresting plot devices required to keep the film moving. While much of the dialog is crisp and well thought out, there are occasional instances when the film's momentum has slowed and all that is left are two people on screen speaking tired recycled lines, in particular the conversations between Dudley and Alvaro de la Quadra (James Frain), a Spanish ambassador, whom talk of nothing but Dudley's allegiance to England and love for Elizabeth twice for two full minutes when once for 20 seconds would have sufficed. Times like this make Elizabeth, a moderate 110 minutes, seem slightly overlong. Also, does anyone really follow Dudley's logic for ultimately betraying Elizabeth? Does he?!However, this is ultimately a sincerely masterful film, particularly its closing scenes, in which Elizabeth decides to take on the fa√ßade of the Virgin Queen, inspired by the likewise Mary, by cutting her hair to the length of a boys, adopting a wig, paling her face and sauntering proudly through her royal chambers claiming that she shall never marry or love again, as she is already to and with, respectfully, her great country of England and its people.

This is not to say that the discussions lack depth, they are just more direct.In any case, though Homer is strong in his beliefs and refuses to even assist his loving mentor Dr. Lurch in such a procedure, by the end of the film Homer will have performed an abortion convinced, just as the audience is, that it was the only possible course of action.

This theme of abortion, however, is an essential component of Cider House, prompting Homer to learn more vital and less clich√©d lessons of life in a smaller time frame.Homer's discoveries during his brief journey span across many varying topics, such as love; in particular, his love for Candy (Charlize Theron). While their affair instigates much of the subsequent happenings in the film, it should not be considered a primary element, just simply another of Homer's experiences, stating that perhaps in the right circumstances it is more important to be needed and not loved yet still love that which needs you.Homer also learns the value of forgiveness, or at least pity, for those who have done wrong in his sympathy for Arthur Rose on his untimely deathbed. After her procedure, Rose leaves the Cider House, fatally stabbing her father when he attempts to interfere. Bleeding to death and panting heavily, Arthur calmly tells Homer to inform the authorities that his death was self-induced, nothing to do with his wayward daughter.

It became the work of which he was most proud, and the one he wanted to be best remembered for in years to come.But for all its grandiosity, the stuff The Gold Rush is made of is the purist Chaplin simplicity. We open, as we so often did in his short pictures, with the formal establishment of the film's setting, in this case an icy mountain range at the height of the Klondike frenzy, a world into which toddles the little tramp. His entrance here is funny purely because of the absurdness of his being here, and his utter inappropriateness for this environment, still kitted out in his familiar bowler hat and baggy trousers. And from here on the majority of the gags tend to be around such ridiculous juxtapositions, such as Charlie's nonchalant carving up of a boot for Thanksgiving dinner. This by the way is the biggest difference between Chaplin and his closest rival Buster Keaton. Keaton's gags involve meticulous planning and amuse you with their sheer cleverness. Chaplin's humour mostly comes from basic ideas, but the comedy is all in the way he plays them out. Chaplin's partnership with Keystone veteran Mack Swain is particularly effective. Swain looks faintly ridiculous with his burly build and babyish face, but he is never funny in his own right and thus holds up his corner of the comedy without ever upstaging the star.The other thing that sets Chaplin apart from his peers is his balancing of comedy with poignant drama, and The Gold Rush is a particularly sweet example of this. Again, we begin with an entrance, this time a more serious one for female lead Georgia Hale. Chaplin shows her coming out of a photographer's, cleverly framing her with some homely portraits down the left-hand side of the screen. Although it's not yet clear to us what part she will play in the story, this linking of her with something that stands out from all the logs and snow makes her stick in our minds. Chaplin's first meeting with her in the dance hall is masterwork of dramatic direction, with Charlie keeping himself an isolated figure at one side of the screen, but constantly pulling our attention to him with little gestures. And never before has the dramatic story in a Chaplin picture been so realistic. The ladies' man Jack (played by the little-known Malcolm Waite) looks and acts like a genuine bully, a far cry from the pompous buffoons Charlie was normally up against, and the whole situation with him and Georgia seems entirely credible. Georgia Hale's steady-paced acting focuses us on her emotions, as does that of Chaplin himself.Considering this was Chaplin's personal favourite &#x96; and it is indeed one of his best &#x96; it is odd to learn that the biggest enemy The Gold Rush was to have in later years was, erm, Charlie Chaplin. In 1943 the comic re-cut his movie to suit what he assumed to be modern tastes. The result is a bizarre travesty. He replaces the intertitles with voice-over narration, which is far more distracting and superfluous than even the wordiest of title texts. Worse still he shortens or cuts out many of the scenes which develop that wonderfully tentative love story between Charlie and Georgia, dragging it down to the level of a crass and gratuitous subplot. Luckily for us, the modern DVD release includes the original version as an extra. The original is the real deal and, as Chaplin hoped, stands the test of time. His 1940s botch-up does not.

Although it's not yet clear to us what part she will play in the story, this linking of her with something that stands out from all the logs and snow makes her stick in our minds. Chaplin's first meeting with her in the dance hall is masterwork of dramatic direction, with Charlie keeping himself an isolated figure at one side of the screen, but constantly pulling our attention to him with little gestures. And never before has the dramatic story in a Chaplin picture been so realistic. The ladies' man Jack (played by the little-known Malcolm Waite) looks and acts like a genuine bully, a far cry from the pompous buffoons Charlie was normally up against, and the whole situation with him and Georgia seems entirely credible. Georgia Hale's steady-paced acting focuses us on her emotions, as does that of Chaplin himself.Considering this was Chaplin's personal favourite &#x96; and it is indeed one of his best &#x96; it is odd to learn that the biggest enemy The Gold Rush was to have in later years was, erm, Charlie Chaplin. In 1943 the comic re-cut his movie to suit what he assumed to be modern tastes. The result is a bizarre travesty. He replaces the intertitles with voice-over narration, which is far more distracting and superfluous than even the wordiest of title texts. Worse still he shortens or cuts out many of the scenes which develop that wonderfully tentative love story between Charlie and Georgia, dragging it down to the level of a crass and gratuitous subplot. Luckily for us, the modern DVD release includes the original version as an extra. The original is the real deal and, as Chaplin hoped, stands the test of time. His 1940s botch-up does not.

It became the work of which he was most proud, and the one he wanted to be best remembered for in years to come.But for all its grandiosity, the stuff The Gold Rush is made of is the purist Chaplin simplicity. We open, as we so often did in his short pictures, with the formal establishment of the film's setting, in this case an icy mountain range at the height of the Klondike frenzy, a world into which toddles the little tramp. His entrance here is funny purely because of the absurdness of his being here, and his utter inappropriateness for this environment, still kitted out in his familiar bowler hat and baggy trousers. And from here on the majority of the gags tend to be around such ridiculous juxtapositions, such as Charlie's nonchalant carving up of a boot for Thanksgiving dinner. This by the way is the biggest difference between Chaplin and his closest rival Buster Keaton. Keaton's gags involve meticulous planning and amuse you with their sheer cleverness. Chaplin's humour mostly comes from basic ideas, but the comedy is all in the way he plays them out. Chaplin's partnership with Keystone veteran Mack Swain is particularly effective. Swain looks faintly ridiculous with his burly build and babyish face, but he is never funny in his own right and thus holds up his corner of the comedy without ever upstaging the star.The other thing that sets Chaplin apart from his peers is his balancing of comedy with poignant drama, and The Gold Rush is a particularly sweet example of this.

With original Creepshow cinematographer Michael Gornick stepping in as director, the film is not only slimmer on content (three stories instead of five) but on budget and star-power as well. That doesn't mean that horror fans aren't in for a heaping serving of campy carnage candy, though. In tradition with the original, Creepshow is hellbent on making its viewers laugh and squirm in their seats simultaneously.While Gornick is no George A. Romero, he certainly brings a touch of style to the film that serves it well. Animated segments aside, the look and tone of the original is carried over into its sequel, with some surprisingly flashy moments that make one wonder why the director fell off the face of the Earth (you know, aside from the fact that this flick flopped). The script, penned by Romero, has its ups and downs, with some stories being more effective and more competent than others. Variety, however, is the key to the film's success. If one thing can be said about this affair, it is that it never bores and it certainly goes by quickly enough. In fact, some would say the fun ends far too early.The three stories are a mixed bag of creepy and goofy, with the first concerning a wooden Indian propped outside of a small-town general store. When local punks rob its kindly owners, the statue comes to life seeking revenge. This bit is rather slow moving and sets the movie off on the wrong foot. Although not terrible by any means, it is in sharp contrast to the two that follow. Next up, we follow a foursome of guys and gals going for a swim in a secluded lake. Soon they find themselves being feasted upon by what can only be described as an oil slick surrounded by a Hefty bag. Of the three, this is probably the strongest, with some genuinely creepy moments and terrific special effects. Then, to wrap things up, we find a woman of questionable morals being stalked on the highway by a drifter she accidentally hit. While his insistence on thanking her for the ride makes him seem harmless enough, the woman quickly slips into madness as she tries to rid herself of the passenger to no avail. This is the one segment most likely to induce a few unintentional chuckles for its ridiculously over-the-top premise and execution.Overall, there's a noticeable drop in quality from the first, but the sense of dread and humor is still intact. Creepshow 2 is certainly a worthy sequel with a few moments of brilliance that may have panned out better in feature length films. The Raft, in particular, would have been a great 80's teen monster movie in the vein of the remake of The Blob that would roll into theaters a year later.

What's just as significant about Beautiful is its status as a risk taking combined-genre film.Director, co-writer and star of Life Is Beautiful Roberto Benigni, however, is of a daring variety, to the extent that he is unsatisfied with the restrained convention of mix-and-match films and so instead has stumbled upon his own creation, in which he incorporates the entire spectrum of human emotion into one production, with themes ranging from slapstick to genocide, romantic comedy to holocaust\/war drama and from the beauty of life to the tragedy of death. What's even more amazing than the theory of this magnitude of variations is his ability to pull it off!To say that the first half of this film, which revolves around lovable goof Guido's (Benigni) attempts to court the beautiful Dora (Benigni's wife Nicoletta), is often carefree is not to suggest that it is careless. True, this section is cheery and light-hearted, but never resorts to cheap sentiment or unjustified romance. On the contrary, the many set-ups and pay-offs that Guido uses to not-too-subtly, yet adoringly pursue Dora are some of the cleverest that one could conceive, ranging from creating an umbrella out of a steering wheel and a pillow to magically producing the key to Dora's emotions.When much more of this banter has taken place to the point that Dora is on the verge of loving Guido, he suddenly takes a different, more seriously approach. He tells Dora that he dreams of making love to her and could happily live the remainder of his life doing it. Now traditionally, if a man tells a woman that he hardly knows of his fantasises for such things, he's probably either drunk or tragically misguided in the ways of seduction. But it is the quiet innocence and gentle honesty with which Guido expresses his desire that detracts from any illicitness or sinister motives that might otherwise be present. He says make love with such na√Øve charm that its phrasing has no meaning pertaining to sex and to imagine this man having sex is just impossible. To him, making love may just be a nice hug.Eventually, while Guido is waiting on patrons at the rehearsal dinner for Dora's pending marriage they meet surreptitiously under a large dining table. Nicola Piovani's award-winning score is at its must potent here, discarding the booming consistency of a string orchestra, leaving just a single harp, strumming and plucking to the absolute sincerity of the scene. Dora crawls slowly and somehow gracefully to Guido and they share their first kiss. Take me away, she whispers. This is the second most beautiful scene in the film.Five years later, Guido and Dora have a beautiful son, Giosu√© (Cantarini), and eventually, Guido and his family are relocated (on Giosu√©'s birthday!) to a concentration camp. While sceptical, Giosu√© allows himself to be told by his loving dad that the camp is a game and the prize, if the rules are followed, is his very own tank. When Guido is selected by a German officer to translate the regulations of the camp into Italian for the rest of the captives, he seizes the opportunity to convince his son that what he says is the truth in the film's funniest scene. As the officer shouts orders and motions violently, Guido shouts in turn a succession of hilarious rules and conditions of playing the game that can be found below, including the loser each day having to wear a sign that says Jackass! Giosu√© is happily persuaded.To learn in the second half of Beautiful that Benigni as an actor as well as a writer is no fool is very rewarding. The utter seriousness and desperation he conveys when he speaks with one of the camp's doctors (an earlier acquaintance made in Arezzo) who he hopes will help his family escape is a refreshingly versatile scene, as is the one immediately succeeding it where Guido is carrying his sleeping son back to their quarters in a heavy night-time fog.

I love how the film manages to blend some of the real historical figures (I.E. the crew of the Titanic) with fictional characters (I.E. Rose, Jack) and yet it is still incredibly believable, as if this really was a true story. The story is largely focused on the relationship between Rose and Jack, but the film constantly manages to develop other characters. Even the present-day characters are really well developed.The story is very well written, and I love the way how it changes in tone throughout. The film starts off exciting, with many people excited, yet still manages to portray Rose in a somewhat sympathetic role. A large portion of it is the romance between Jack and Rose, but the film manages to have some dramatic scenes, with a large sub-plot of the story being the conflict between Rose and the rest of her upper-class family. The film even manages to include a bit of humour here and there, but doesn't take it too far. However everything changes near the end, when we have the iceberg, and all of a sudden the film becomes very dark and tragic.The climax is very impressive. It takes place once the Titanic hits the iceberg. At this point, the film manages to successfully shift focus between different people. It manages to focus on the protagonists, but also manages to focus on the chaos and tension as the ship sinks and the crew struggle to keep order and get the passengers off safely. It brilliantly manages to capture the tragedy and horror of the disaster.Overall this movie is a cinematic masterpiece and one that you definitely should see if you haven't already.

I love how the film manages to blend some of the real historical figures (I.E. the crew of the Titanic) with fictional characters (I.E. Rose, Jack) and yet it is still incredibly believable, as if this really was a true story. The story is largely focused on the relationship between Rose and Jack, but the film constantly manages to develop other characters. Even the present-day characters are really well developed.The story is very well written, and I love the way how it changes in tone throughout. The film starts off exciting, with many people excited, yet still manages to portray Rose in a somewhat sympathetic role. A large portion of it is the romance between Jack and Rose, but the film manages to have some dramatic scenes, with a large sub-plot of the story being the conflict between Rose and the rest of her upper-class family. The film even manages to include a bit of humour here and there, but doesn't take it too far. However everything changes near the end, when we have the iceberg, and all of a sudden the film becomes very dark and tragic.The climax is very impressive. It takes place once the Titanic hits the iceberg. At this point, the film manages to successfully shift focus between different people. It manages to focus on the protagonists, but also manages to focus on the chaos and tension as the ship sinks and the crew struggle to keep order and get the passengers off safely. It brilliantly manages to capture the tragedy and horror of the disaster.Overall this movie is a cinematic masterpiece and one that you definitely should see if you haven't already.

I love the way it is told in flashback.It begins with a group of present-day treasure hunters exploring the wreckage of the Titanic (which results in some brilliant underwater footage). They find an old safe that's completely empty save for a drawing of a woman. An elderly woman suddenly phones them and says she's the woman in the picture.

The two of them make one of the most memorable outlaw couples ever, believe it or not. Lewis is the clueless girlfriend, willingly abused by Pitt, the knee-jerk killer. The two have to leave the state and they get a ride in a big old convertible with another couple, smart and styling and at first disdainful of this hick pair they are suddenly driving cross country with.This could have been a great movie, a classic. Lewis and Pitt are so convincing, and so original, really, playing with humor and without grandiose notions, which inflate so many other films. Individually they carve out chilling, and yet also warm, pictures of who they are, real people, and unexpected ones. The mannerisms that Lewis pulls out in every scene, her dumb looks, her surprise, this is all virtuosic. What drags them down is the other couple. David Duchovny is especially wooden. You can feel him wanting us to think he's a likable, even-keeled, handsome hunk. But he's just plain dull, and he is ostensibly the main character. It's his voice that comes in like a bad bad film noir narrator now and then, giving some perspective to the events. It's unnecessary monologue, to boot, and straight out of screen writing 101. For some reason Duchovny's character, a struggling writer working on a book about psycho killers, is given the most mundane and overused lines. His girlfriend, a slightly touch looking photographer played by Michelle Forbes, has to work through her part at first, but eventually comes into her own, with knowing glances and a growing sense of fear.The other true star, beyond Pitt and Lewis, is the cameraman, Bojan Bazelli, working with some great sets and with a director who sets him free. In some scenes, the arrangement of characters just talking, is filled with such space and layer and light, or with such audacious rain, you want them to hold it longer so you can get it all. For all the ugly things that happen, this is a beautiful movie. The director? Dominic Sena, a music video shooter. That's probably why it looked so good and had some stumbles in the bigger vision.If you go into this expecting something profound, forget about it. But the two performances are worth the admission alone, and even though it gets increasingly violent, which I'm not into, it gets increasingly interesting and gripping as it goes. The set up in the first half hour is groaningly bad at times, but once the four of them hit the road, look out.

I don't know why it has taken this long for me to see it. It just has. And now that's it's over, I feel like I just got punched in the face. Maybe even kicked there too. Now I'll admit it. I like the Academy Awards. I do. They may get things wrong often. But if I'm being honest, they get many things right too. However, every now and then they make a mistake that is so egregious, there's no justification for it. And not, at the very least, nominating Requiem for best picture is one of those inexcusable mistakes. Don't get me wrong. I liked Gladiator. In fact, Gladiator (which won best picture for 2000) is a film that exceeded my expectations. There was far more depth found within it than I could have imagined. But when we're talking about the realm of overall societal and cultural relevance and importance, Gladiator does not hold a candle to Requiem...plain and simple. All too often, films get labeled important just for being edgy and willing to test the boundaries of a difficult subject matter. Well Requiem doesn't just test the boundaries when it comes to portraying the destructiveness of drug addiction, it obliterates them. This really is one of the most important films ever made. Aronofsky pulls no punches here. He is determined, with this film, to lay bare any and all deceptions that are attached to drugs. And he exposes them for what they really are. Slow, painful, and methodical killers. The downward spiral that is exhibited by the characters is both heartbreaking and disturbing. And the acting is phenomenal. There's no doubt that Ellen Burstyn deserved her Oscar nomination. Her performance was just about as realistic as it gets. But I think other nods could have been given as well, especially in regards to Jennifer Connelly. I really don't even have words to describe her performance except to say that it was mesmerizing. I can't imagine how difficult it had to have been for her to prepare for this role. The content is raw and uncompromising. And to be completely honest, some of the scenes are difficult to watch. However, in the end it is the message that rings loud and clear. It is the message that trumps everything else.

By the time the 40 minute mark reaches, the film takes a whole new path, which of course is expected in a Lynch film. The film is never dull or boring, and it does have a lot of surreal scenes that will mystify and confuse viewers, but I still think it is a film that would work with mainstream audiences. I can see many movie fans being perplexed by the turns the film takes, yet still highly enjoy it, and in that respect, I think it is because Lynch is probably trying to make a film that will be a commercial hit (seeing as how Twin Peaks Fire Walk With Me flopped despite it being one of his best). I can definitely sense him making this one for the audience (unlike his newest film, Inland Empire, which got better reviews with the critics than Lost Highway yet seems to frustrate viewers a lot more). Saying that, I do think that parts of the film are not as engaging as some of his other films. Ultimately though, Lost Highway still builds on Lynch's impressive resume, although from the 7 films that I have seen from him, this is in the bottom along with The Elephant Man. Yet, Lynch's weaker entries are still better than most films out there, which this is because I am sure it will become a favorite of mine as well.

From the small amount of information I had, he seemed like a completely unlikeable malicious idiot with an annoying haircut. So I certainly had some preconceptions about the man before seeing this film. After seeing it, I had to admit that, like most things in life, the truth is much more complex. In actual fact I came away from Private Parts liking and respecting Mr Stern quite a bit. Quite a turn-around.Sometimes with a biopic it's good to have very little knowledge of the subject. The trajectory of the story is then more surprising to you. This was true for me with Private Parts, as I had no real clue about Howard Stern's rise to fame. However, what surprised me the most was Stern's character. He was not afraid to paint himself as pathetic, and the honesty of this approach is the key to why it's such a compelling film. Some people have commented that this movie is self-serving and that Stern portrays himself as some kind of misunderstood innocent. While I can't definitively say if this is true or not, my gut feeling is that he depicts himself in a fairly honest way. Many times he shows himself to be seriously uncool and pathetic. And because his whole shtick is about not holding back and saying what he thinks, you can't help but feel that this ethos must apply to the movie too, and this is most probably what he is like.The film is often very funny, and I can't really often say this for most comedies. It mixes standard biopic drama with some inventive comedy moments that recall the style of Woody Allen; although an admittedly lower-brow Woody Allen with a fair smattering of naked women. But still, it's in that general ball-park. Stern is very good as, well, Stern. I think it's quite a reasonable achievement to be fair as it's actually not always that easy playing yourself. Take a look at a few of the cameo appearances in some of the episodes of Extras for proof of this bizarre truth. Anyway, he is a compelling central character, whose underlying personality seems to be very decent. Paul Giamatti is the other actor who stands out. His portrayal of Pig Vomit is hilarious.This is a great comic biopic. You certainly do not need to be familiar with its lead character to enjoy it, as it's a very well delivered and funny story.

And yes, it's the second Batman movie. The Adam West one counts.Blooming out of the mind of oddball director Tim Burton, this Batman movie was one of the first films to introduce the general public to the darker and more psychologically complex world of comic book super-heroes that had replaced the wholesome, square-jawed, morally correct characters of the 1940s and 50s. That a DC character like Batman is the one who exposed America to the changes actually brought to the super-hero genre by Stan Lee and company at Marvel is one of those quirks of history. This Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton) is an odd fellow, disconnected from other people and real life, with genuine pain lingering just under his skin.Keaton's Wayne and Batman are probably the most interesting version of the character to ever appear in a movie, which makes it especially strange and regrettable that this film really isn't about him. First and foremost, it's about the Joker (Jack Nicholson). His transformation from slightly disturbed mob enforcer to larger than life, mass murdering super-villain is at the heart of the story. Everyone else is really part of an ensemble supporting Nicholson, with Bruce Wayne not being that much bigger a part than Knox (Robert Wuhl), the muckraking reporter out to break the story of Batman, or Vicky Vale (Kim Basinger), the photojournalist who comes to Gotham because she read Knox's stories and likes bats. In fact, Knox and Vale are really more important characters to the story than Wayne or Batman for the first half of the film. It's not until the second half of the movie that the title character plays a major role in what's going on.It's to Burton's credit and the actors' that the story doesn't really suffer because of its contrary focus. As you rewatch it, it makes less and less sense that Batman is largely about everyone except Batman. It's hard to understand why they thought the Knox character was necessary, for example. But Nicholson carries the movie on his back, Basinger brings more than you'd expect to the girlfriend\/damsel in distress role and Keaton's performance is so quietly suggestive and intriguing that you don't realize how little he's actually in the film.Visually, the movie is as interesting as Burton's other films. Gotham City is a crowded, dirty, urban hell, like a 17th century city that grew and metastasized without any planning or zoning considerations. The Batmobile in this film supplanted the look of the 1960s version, becoming the standard template for how the vehicle would look for over 20 years. The Batsuit in this movie is probably the best looking version of the costume ever on film, certainly more aesthetically pleasing than the battlesuit Batman of the two most recent movies, though it did give us the thick, rubber Bat-helmet look that has burdened the character ever since. Burton doesn't really know how to shoot a great action sequence, but at least he keeps the camera steady so you can see what's going on. And there are a few times when Burton seems to miss the point of a scene and shoot it in a confusing manner.In the wake of all the praise given to Heath Ledger's performance in The Dark Knight, you might think that Nicholson's Joker would pale in comparison&#x85;but it doesn't. Ledger's Joker is a much deeper character who is less a real person and more a living embodiment of anarchy. Nicholson's Joker is much more grounded. He's an evil person, but he's very much a person. He has understandable goals and motivations. He's just someone who's inhibitions and impulse control have been stripped away. Some might say Ledger's Joker is more realistic but it's Nicholson who creates a more fully formed character.It is the question of realism that most divides this film from the more recent movie incarnations of Batman (and this film's immediate sequels as well). This movie is very much a work of fantasy where the filmmakers and actors don't expect it to conform to the rules and needs of the real world and don't expect the audience to want that either. It has an internal logic and sense of its own reality, but there's virtually no effort made to explain or justify how this stuff could happen in the real world.

I thought he handled the part beautifully and was very creepy. I think many people hate this movie is because of the deliberate slow pace, and that it tried to be something different.

Charlize Theron is excellent in her role. She carried the film very well, and had a perfect chemistry with Depp. We aren't sure if she's crazy or not, and that was a tough feat to pull off.

The movie begins with a body floating in water off the coast of France, pulled into a boat. Soon we learn he is not an ordinary person. There is something mysterious about him. He is suffering from memory loss and doesn't remember anything about his own identity. On top of that, there are dark characters lurking at every corner that are chasing after him. As the story unfolds, we get to find out more about him but there is still a good amount of unknown facts that maintain the suspense and mystery. This is a very well-made movie with a very well written screenplay, amazing action scenes (the car chase scene is just amazing) that will keep you at the edge of your seat until the end. Jason Bourne, like James Bond, is a spy and this is a spy movie but in many ways there are major differences which make The Bourne Identity quiet special. Most James Bond movies are one-dimensional in the sense that James Bond is the good guy and everybody he is eliminating are the bad guys. Jason Bourne, on the other hand, is multi-dimensional because he is constantly re-defining himself (and that goes throughout the entire trilogy) and the movie is not really drawing a clear picture if he is the bad guy or the good guy. This ambiguity is possible due to his amnesiac condition. For all we know, he may have been a bad guy before his accident but now he is defining himself with his current actions. This ambiguity creates a mystery around him. And the mystery is thickened through the identity of the people who are trying to eliminate him, mainly Conklin (Chris Cooper) who is running the Treadstone project (more about Treadstone in later movies). The conflict between Jason Bourne and Conklin, and Bourne's turning against the people who gave him the assignment adds a whole another dimension to the movie which is not seen in James Bond movies. I must say that The Bourne Identity is probably the best movie of its kind. It doesn't fall into known clich√©s, unrealistic action scenes, explosions, hero doesn't display any super powers, no special effects, no silly plot twists and turns or plot holes, all of which we are accustomed to see in average Hollywood production.

I loved the camera work in I am Cuba, but I felt that the story was too rigid, too much of a propaganda piece, too much of an advertisement for my taste. The characters weren't real enough, not fully developed. It felt as if I were watching types of people rather than actual people. In The Cranes are Flying, which Kalatozov made prior to I am Cuba, I didn't find the same problem. The story is thoroughly engaging, and I felt a whole range of emotions. The lead character, specifically is so real, I think she will haunt my dreams. She is played by Tatyana Samojlova who deserves special acclaim. She is dazzling. Her sweet charm reminded me of Audrey Hepburn, and yet Samojlova's acting seems to have a broader range. Hers is more realistic in a way that feels ahead of its time in 1957. Her wild despair is in a league with the best emoter actresses, such as Natalie Wood, Isabelle Adjani, Juliette Binoche. I must mention, also, that the cinematography is so crisp, it seems to be 4 decades ahead of its time. As far as composition and movement of the camera, I'd say it has strains of several styles, including German Expressionism of the 20's and 30's, and the stormy noir melodramas of the '40s, like Out of the Past (1947). This is a romantic, dramatic movie that looks long and hard at the repercussions of war, and yes, it does have a message and it certainly hammers it home, but still I think it stays more clearly in the realm of universal themes, rather than falling into the propagandist ditch.In summary, I don't think I have ever seen better acting, better camera work, better editing, or better direction in any movie made previous to it. There were some scenes made with such planning and precision that I had to press PAUSE just to catch my breath. Lovers of movie history, enjoy!

I must mention, also, that the cinematography is so crisp, it seems to be 4 decades ahead of its time. As far as composition and movement of the camera, I'd say it has strains of several styles, including German Expressionism of the 20's and 30's, and the stormy noir melodramas of the '40s, like Out of the Past (1947). This is a romantic, dramatic movie that looks long and hard at the repercussions of war, and yes, it does have a message and it certainly hammers it home, but still I think it stays more clearly in the realm of universal themes, rather than falling into the propagandist ditch.In summary, I don't think I have ever seen better acting, better camera work, better editing, or better direction in any movie made previous to it. There were some scenes made with such planning and precision that I had to press PAUSE just to catch my breath. Lovers of movie history, enjoy!

I loved the camera work in I am Cuba, but I felt that the story was too rigid, too much of a propaganda piece, too much of an advertisement for my taste. The characters weren't real enough, not fully developed. It felt as if I were watching types of people rather than actual people. In The Cranes are Flying, which Kalatozov made prior to I am Cuba, I didn't find the same problem. The story is thoroughly engaging, and I felt a whole range of emotions. The lead character, specifically is so real, I think she will haunt my dreams. She is played by Tatyana Samojlova who deserves special acclaim. She is dazzling.

It is based on the play Kind Sir written by Norman Krasna. Plot sees Bergman as Anna Kalman, an accomplished actress who can't believe her luck when she finally meets the man of her dreams, Philip Adams (Grant). However, Phillip is keeping a secret, a secret that Anna finds out about and promptly sets about getting even with him for.Indiscreet is a very simple movie. Grant and Bergman re-team again 12 years after making Notorious with Alfred Hitchcock. Their chemistry is again sparkling and Donen utilises it to the maximum by naturally building the film around the charismatic stars. There's no hidden agendas here, the movie knows it is breezy and understands that good writing (edgy at times) and two comfortable actors can make for good entertainment. It starts off slow, but the character build up pays off once Grant & Bergman start their romance, in fact the comedy is indeed thin on the ground for the first half of the film. But once the secret at the core of the plot is out, the comedy kicks into gear, with a dancing party sequence joyous and alone is worth watching the film for.Also note worthy is the London location which provides a fitting back drop to the well mannered, well to do, coupling of Anna & Phillip. While the costumes too are pleasing and hang nicely off of the two aesthetically safe-in middle-age actors. It's no screwball, far from it, so any expectation of that will surely disappoint newcomers. And true to say it's very old fashioned and of its time as regards its romantic ideals. But that's OK, we like light hearted well written comedy, especially when it's performed as smooth as it is here. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"7 September 2010","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Out of Warner Brothers, Indiscreet is directed by Stanley Donen and stars Ingrid Bergman & Cary Grant, with support coming from Cecil Parker, Phyllis Calvert, David Kossoff & Megs Jenkins.

A Christopher Guest improv movie! I know, I know, but this one is probably his best, in my humble opinion. The comedy just flows so nicely, the production work put into the dog show itself, the cast of remarkable characters with their own hilarious quirks, and it's an animal movie! I love Eugene Levy's ridiculous character as a bucktoothed, double-left-foot-having, concerned husband through the whole film as he meets past lovers of his wife, Cookie (O'Hara). The dogs matched all of the owners really well, and I loved Parker Posey's meltdowns as her and her yuppie husband try and perform new age healing on their dogs' mental state in every scene that the dog loses it. And Scott & Stefan (John Michael Higgins and Michael McKean) were hilarious as a feng shui-obsessed gay couple.There's very little that I don't like about this film. I took off a point because it is, after all, another of Guest's improv comedies, so it's like redoing a past movie or something, replacing the past plot with this one. But this is actually a movie to buy instead of rent, even though its indie culture behind the actors and everything may not be the most obviously appealing.

Basically Miami dentist Ted Brooks (Cuba Gooding Jr.) has his face on hundreds of buses in the city, and he receives a letter from Alaska informing him of the death of his birth mother, so he was adopted by Amelia (Star Trek's Nichelle Nichols). He has an inheritance to claim, so he travels to the snowy Alaskan village of Tolketna where he is given a shack, and a pack of sled dogs who aren't every keen on their new owner. Despite not getting on with the dogs, and having a cash offer from grizzly Thunder Jack (James Coburn, in his final screen appearance before his fatal heart attack), Ted keeps the dogs like his mother intended. Along the journey of trying to get the dogs on his side, he starts hanging out with Barb (Joanna Bacalso), and it is obvious a love interest is developing between them. When Ted hears about the up and coming Arctic Challenge, a local race, he wants to have the dogs compete and show Thunder Jack, who may or not be his father (but is apparently) what they're made of. Also starring Thong Song rapper and Celebrity Big Brother's Sisq√≥ as Dr. Rupert Brooks, Wild Wild West's M.

With films like Boyz n the Hood and Jerry Maguire it is quite annoying seeing Gooding Jr. wasting his time in films like this, Boat Trip and Norbit, he hasn't done anything really good since Rat Race. Anyway, he and the rest of the cast don't do much, it is up to the cute and cuddly wolf-like husky dogs to keep the young audience happy, and some quite dull slapstick comedy, it is pretty terrible.
