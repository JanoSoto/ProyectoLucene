This marvel of marketing deserves its props for one main reason, and that's the way it uses its low, low budget to its advantage, placing all of its horrors squarely inside the heads of its viewers, forcing them to use their imaginations to conjure up their own demons. The story hardly needs summarizing by this point, but suffice it to say that it presents itself as the real footage of three student filmmakers who get lost in the wilderness of Maryland while investigating a local legend. What this viewer has to say, in his own personal experience, is that repeat viewings have helped him to appreciate it more than he used to. A large part of the appeal is the *very* rural setting, and the idea of being lost in this setting and having no idea where to go, possibly ending up going in circles, which would be an extremely distressing thought. Now, the largely improvised dialogue is no great shakes, but it does offer a realistic enough account of the way that humans under extreme stress may very well speak, alternating between sniping at each other and trying to bolster each others' spirits. Our three protagonists, played by Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Michael Williams, aren't entirely unsympathetic. The directors slowly increase the sense of menace throughout, with the last act naturally registering as the creepiest. Interview sequences at the beginning are definitely amusing. The arts and crafts displayed by our unseen antagonist(s) are genuinely striking, and do lead to my favorite line in the film Rednecks aren't this creative! Of course, the idea in this film of one character stubbornly insisting on documenting *everything* has already become a cliché; while of course we wouldn't have the movie if this person weren't doing so, it's all too easy to understand how this would annoy other people. Overall, I realize I have been under-rating this for years (watching it late at night or early in the morning with all the lights off would create the perfect effect) - it does have good atmosphere - although *that* scene has always cracked me up, and that was before I even saw Scary Movie. In the end, it does appear that assessments of The Blair Witch Project usually do tend to rely on how one reacts - either it works for the viewer or it doesn't. Seven out of 10.

What make 'Phantasm' different are slow off-the-tone and sometimes absolutely fast nightmarish sequences, that kill the crap out of you. The film is remembered as a cult-classic now, and there is a fairly good reason behind it. After watching this film, you'd feel like you'd just lived a nightmare to the fullest. The 'Tall Man' is one of the most haunting villains one would ever wish to see for real. Don Coscarelli is a great craftsman, who has the ability to get down to the sub-conscious levels and explore the underlying fears of the human mind. It's been more than 30 years now since its release, but it holds a charisma that wouldn't fade with time. This truly is non-degradable.The film begins with Morningside cemetery, where Tommy is busy making love with a vampiric blonde. Moments later, the scantily clad blonde transforms to a vicious looking old man, The Tall Man (Angus Scrimm). The Tall Man kills Tommy and we soon land at his funeral. Jody (Bill Thornbury) and Reggie (Reggie Bannister) are friends, and members of a band. They are here because Tommy was their friend and a band member. Jody's brother Mike (Michael Baldwin) is prejudiced with a thought that Jody would abandon him in near future. Long back, after the demise of their parents, Mike was looked after by Jody. Mike doesn't want to lose Jody but his fears torment him. He sneakingly follows Jody and Reggie at the funeral and notices something strange at the Morningside. He also gets a glimpse of the unholy undertaker of the cemetery. The Tall Man, takes Tommy's dead body back to his hearse after the attendees leave. Mike wants to find cure for his trauma, and seeks help of a local fortune teller, who asks him to give up his fears regarding Jody. Mike is followed by ghoulish dwarfs, who are after him for no apparent reason, or this is what Mike thinks. Jody disregards Mike's strange story about the Tall Man. Agitated by the belief that his fears are not baseless, Mike heads to the cemetery. There he is chased by the Tall Man and his henchmen, satanic spheres and ugly dwarfs. During the fracas, the Tall Man happens to cut his finger that squirts yellow goo instead of blood. Mike takes the finger along and shows it to Jody as evidence. Jody, Reggie and Mike join hands to finish the Tall Man and his minions. They eventually discover that the Tall Man is an inter-dimensional being, who has a portal to his own scorching and hellish world at the Morningside cemetery. The Tall Man harvests townspeople and enslaves them by transforming them into dwarfs. Everything goes on surreptitiously until our men decide to have their final showdown with the Tall Man.'Phantasm' is more like a dream than a movie. You must have dreamed something bizarre at least once in your life, and 'Phantasm' is the same eccentric trip to the unknown depths of metaphysics. Don Coscarelli has made use of heavy symbolism to show the nihilistic worth of a matter or incident. The disappearance of money and magic box, gloomy mortuary set-up, silence prevailing inside the mausoleum, the dwarfs and their journey to other dimension and finally the angel of death in disguise, 'The Tall Man' are all symbolic. Mike is a victim of his own fear, the death itself. He believes Jody would leave him someday, but Jody, as Reggie tells Mike, had already died in a car crash. Was Mike unable to accept Jody's death due to inherent attachment with his brother? Did Jody already die before these bizarre incidents? We can't really know and neither could anyone. This freaky ride is enough to create a long lasting terror as 'Phantasm' is more like a doorway between the two worlds. The first world is our own mundane world, which we can see and perceive, while the other world is located in a different dimension, which has its own laws and regulations, but certainly all the otherworldly incidents and beings can neither be understood nor analyzed with rational eyes. 'Phantasm' has been crafted with a non-noetic expertise and we should remember that it all started in our own world. 'Phantasm' qualifies itself to be a perfect cult flick, with one of the greatest atmospheres and vivid representations of death. The 'Phantasm' sequels were loosely aligned with the main story, where the Tall Man has been depicted as an evil force that misuses the powers solely for diabolic purposes. This film offers a great combination of 'Body (Jody, Reggie, and Mike), Mind (The Tall Man is actually the personification of fear and death), and Soul (the dwarfs, who are condemned to the hell forever). Don't even think about missing this film, because this would sure have a great impact on you and would give you a deeper insight about the real horror that always stalks and ambushes life.......The Death!

Unlike the Harry Potter films, this movie gave not only a message but a certain meaning to life. In life, people sometimes tend to lose themselves when they start to become rich. They lose their humanity, sense of love and family and the only thing that matters to them is wealth. This was the case with Perhan in the movie. This movie did not go on a moral crusade and trying to convince the audience what is good and bad. Rather the film reiterates the importance of family and being honest. Personally, I have always considered family to be the most important aspect of my life. Without family, one loses their most loyal companions, ones who a person can always fall back on in life. Through Perhan's success, he lost his humanity with his wealth. Only once his wife Azra died from childbirth did he regain his humanity. From my personal opinion, there is nothing more valuable to a person than his or her family. This film was made for everyone to understand the importance of family and remembering where one comes from.Another interesting aspect of Time of the Gypsies was the fact that through its magical realism, it showed the audience how magical life can be. Life is the most magical thing in the world. There are multiple reasons and each person can name his or her own reasons why life is magical to them. The point is that in everyday life, events occur that have a lasting impression on the person. Magic doesn't need to be telekinetic powers but rather the beauty in life itself is the most wonderful and amazing thing in the world. If one were to close their eyes they would miss the beauty in life. Time of the Gypsies showed how any kind of person, regardless of financial and personal issues, can find the magic in life.

This chest plate is designed to stop bullets, which it does. Back to the Future II has this scene playing in the background and Back to the Future III actually uses this in the final confrontation. The plot of this movie has also taken by other movies, especially Last Man Standing, so it has been quite influential.A nameless gunman (Clint Eastwood) wonders into a Mexican Border Town and learns that there is no law and that it is ruled by two rival gangs. The man decides that he can make a lot of money playing both side off against each other and sets about doing that. He ends up causing one to wipe out the other and then turns on the other and destroys them. It is a simple plot but there are some interesting ideas in it.The two gangs are different nationalities one is run by Americans, Baxter, and the other is run by Mexicans, Ramerez. These two gangs seem to represent the two greater powers on the North American continent, or even the two racial groups being the Hispanic and the Americans. This is confirmed at the end when Eastwood says that he has no desire to get caught up in the politics of the two sides when they meet.Eastwood, though he is American, is the typical lone wolf. He does not show loyalty to either side, and in fact he attacks the American gang first and allies with the Mexican gang, though he has no thought of really helping them. Thus this movie takes a very anti-authoritarian and even chooses to turn against one's own government. Even then this probably takes the side of the right wing in America, which chooses to limit the government. As such we should be free to live as we want to without any government to hinder us. This is not a major point though because instead of trying to destroy that which rules, he chooses to use it for his own personal gain, the idea of capitalism.I would believe that this movie is very right winged, but then most Westerns tend to be. It is about entering a hostile world and taming it. But the era of the Western has gone because now the west has been tamed, they turn to the cities and seek to tame them now. The 70's, 80's and 90's have brought the world from the west and into the city where the violence and adventure now rules for the west has simply become a tame land of farms.

These two gangs seem to represent the two greater powers on the North American continent, or even the two racial groups being the Hispanic and the Americans. This is confirmed at the end when Eastwood says that he has no desire to get caught up in the politics of the two sides when they meet.Eastwood, though he is American, is the typical lone wolf. He does not show loyalty to either side, and in fact he attacks the American gang first and allies with the Mexican gang, though he has no thought of really helping them. Thus this movie takes a very anti-authoritarian and even chooses to turn against one's own government. Even then this probably takes the side of the right wing in America, which chooses to limit the government. As such we should be free to live as we want to without any government to hinder us. This is not a major point though because instead of trying to destroy that which rules, he chooses to use it for his own personal gain, the idea of capitalism.I would believe that this movie is very right winged, but then most Westerns tend to be. It is about entering a hostile world and taming it. But the era of the Western has gone because now the west has been tamed, they turn to the cities and seek to tame them now. The 70's, 80's and 90's have brought the world from the west and into the city where the violence and adventure now rules for the west has simply become a tame land of farms.

I found the Flintstones to be clichéd, full of shameless advertising which did not work on me, having a very bland and boring plot, and generally I thought it was rubbish. The film was targeted at children, but those of us who grew up with the Flintstones, would have seen this movie for the memories. My comment on this is that I am glad that I waited for it to come on to television. The Flintstones worked as a cartoon, but it does not work as a live action movie.The idea behind the Flintstones is that they are a typical American family living in the stone age. The original creators did this as a parody of the American way of life. The concept was clever and the show was very popular. What the filmmakers have tried to do is to continue this theme and in the movie it does not work. I thought that their attempt to parody the American culture failed abysmally. The worse part was their attempt at doing this with McDonalds. It was supposed to be funny, but I thought that is was a shameless product placement for a place that I detest anyway. In the original cartoons, I thought that the creators taking modern inventions and placing them in the prehistoric setting was clever, here it is not.Turning away from the rubbish that is this movie, I think that there is something that is interesting that appears in the original cartoon as well as here. Remembering that the movie is an attempt to copy the cartoon, the concept is probably not as important here. Everything in the Flintstones is big. With the modern age of miniaturisation, things have become smaller, which means that we have more space for more stuff, but what we see in the Flintstones is a reflection of hyperconsumption. Everything here is much larger than life. Spare ribs are so big that they tip the car over. Families have sabretooth tigers instead of cats, and Pterrodactyls do their business on cars instead of pigeons. The direction of society today is to have more and better things, especially in regards to food. With 60% of Americans on weightloss programs, it is interesting to see how big things in the Flintstones reflect the hyperconsumer of the American way of life.The only thing that I liked about the movie was Dino. He was obviously computer animated, but I thought that they did an incredible job with him. Dino is seriously cool, the huge dog that always jumps on Fred and slobbers all over him. The interaction between Dino and Fred was quite impressive. Other than this, I did not like this movie one bit.

And you know what? Dude was right.I don't get affairs. Nor ritualized sex. And apparently neither did Kubrick when he made this film. To me this film is one made by a man who had too much cinematic power, and was probably trying to stay on top of the burgeoning adult video market that was becoming more accessible to mainstream America by virtue of net commerce.It's well shot, of that there is no doubt. Technical marks all hit their cues, and are right on target. But the story itself? Wow. Pretty vapid stuff if you ask me.I think the problem here is that the question of why do people have affairs is pretty straight forward. People have sexual interests in one another, and sometimes if they're married they're willing to take their chances on breaking a legal bond with their spouse. There's not much more to it than that. It's part of why women put men through so many test during courtship.I think Kubrick, and perhaps a good portion of cuckolds or non-sexually active society are tantalized and interested in sex, so this movie was made.Me, I haven't laughed so hard at certain points in the film since Used Cars. I just truly think this is a ridiculous film on a number of levels, and it's not something I would ever make nor watch again. A couple that has fallen off the beaten track either has an abusive situation going on, or one of them lacks character. Again, it's pretty simple stuff. No film can really capture the magic of an affair, because affairs aren't magical to begin with. They're acts of betrayal. Like I said, it's not a film I'll ever see again, nor would I like to work on this kind of project (paycheque depending). Hell, if I were forced to shoot something like this, I'd end it with a bunch of special forces men rappelling down from helicopters during the orgy scene and raiding the place. Just me *insert smile here*.Not everyone can have a really good looking spouse, nor have steamy conjugal relations on a regular basis. So the urge is repressed, and when someone mentions the idea to another person, these stupid, cult like, religious swingers societies develop. And I imagine people get hurt. I don't really know as I've no experience in that matter.But, Kubrick wants us to look at his version of a couple gone swinging; one that has sexual exploration in mind. To me it's more of a comedy than anything else. I used to love seeing a Kubirck film because of his static yet compelling cinematography. The shots and assemblage of images from a former photo-journalist are supreme in execution.

'Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea','Lost in Space' and 'Star Trek' lead to my life long love of that genre. Yes, 'VttBotS' and 'LiS' had their extremely silly episodes in later seasons when they were running out of ideas, still their original concepts and earlier stories were good sci-fi. I should probably add 'The Twilight Zone' and 'Outer Limits' to that list, they were more constantly good IMO as was 'Star Trek'. BTW-I loved 'Fireball XL5' too.The movie takes global warning to the extreme. It's pretty silly really, but fun none the less. All it takes is one nuclear missile launched by the Seaview at the precise date, time and location to save the world. Admiral Nelson is determined to launch that missile with or without permission to do so by the worlds governments. Many obstacles pop up to stop him along the way. All of his precise calculations to save the world are double checked by Admiral Nelson and Comm. Lucius Emery using their trusty slide rules. Does anybody besides me remember those gadgets? PCs are for wimps.The stars Walter Pidgeon and Peter Lorre add to the films magic. Walter Pidgeon plays Admiral Nelson like Dr. Morbius in a navy uniform, which to me is a good thing. Once again he plays a genius to perfection. Overweight and slow moving Peter Lorre pretty much sleep walks through his role, still he's fun to watch in just about anything. Especially when he's in the water tank working with the big rubber shark or defending the Admiral. Barbara Eden never looked better, except in her 'I Dream of Jennie' outfit hidden belly button and all.The other star of the film is the Seaview itself. I can't think of a better sub design in SF, movies or TV. The coolness of the sub was even added to in later years when the flying sub concept arrived on the TV series. What I liked most about the Seaview design was those unique large front view windows with metal crash shudders.Anyway, I see this post is getting way too long and I've probably already lost most of you. I'll close by saying, I enjoy this film every time I watch it. If you haven't seen it you should.

Admiral Nelson is determined to launch that missile with or without permission to do so by the worlds governments. Many obstacles pop up to stop him along the way. All of his precise calculations to save the world are double checked by Admiral Nelson and Comm. Lucius Emery using their trusty slide rules. Does anybody besides me remember those gadgets? PCs are for wimps.The stars Walter Pidgeon and Peter Lorre add to the films magic. Walter Pidgeon plays Admiral Nelson like Dr. Morbius in a navy uniform, which to me is a good thing. Once again he plays a genius to perfection. Overweight and slow moving Peter Lorre pretty much sleep walks through his role, still he's fun to watch in just about anything. Especially when he's in the water tank working with the big rubber shark or defending the Admiral. Barbara Eden never looked better, except in her 'I Dream of Jennie' outfit hidden belly button and all.The other star of the film is the Seaview itself. I can't think of a better sub design in SF, movies or TV. The coolness of the sub was even added to in later years when the flying sub concept arrived on the TV series. What I liked most about the Seaview design was those unique large front view windows with metal crash shudders.Anyway, I see this post is getting way too long and I've probably already lost most of you.

Also, it spawned the TV series which was a big fav when I was a kid. I even built a flying sub model once. 'Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea','Lost in Space' and 'Star Trek' lead to my life long love of that genre. Yes, 'VttBotS' and 'LiS' had their extremely silly episodes in later seasons when they were running out of ideas, still their original concepts and earlier stories were good sci-fi. I should probably add 'The Twilight Zone' and 'Outer Limits' to that list, they were more constantly good IMO as was 'Star Trek'.

The opening sequences remains one of my favorite scenes in any film and continues to give me goosebumps to this day.

I must admit that Robin Williams is a funny guy, but this is not one of his funniest movies. The best scene in the movie was when he walks into a life drawing class thinking that it is his physics class and goes ahead and teaches. Other than that this movie is rather ordinary with lots of clichés to fill it up. I enjoyed it, a bit, but I have seen better.Basically, a college is about to be shut down and Robin Williams is an absent minded professor who has missed his wedding three times. It is interesting that he has a robot that is in love with him and is forcing him not to marry the woman who he loves. This is all very cute but I thought that it was a little silly. The professor is very smart but, as is introduced rather quickly, somebody else always steals his ideas and gets the fame for it. The guy is basically the bad guy who is milking the professor for all he is worth. Then there is the corporate boss who thinks that solving problems is done by throwing money at it. He wants his kid to get straight A's so he throws money at it.When we look at the movie we see once again the theme of the American Dream. Everybody can become happy and rich if they simply work at it. All problems can be over come by ones own ability and that the end is always happy. This is a very shallow and idealistic theme which generally annoys me. Even though, Flubber is a kids movie though it has a few interesting scenes thrown in to keep the adults interested, because it is the adults that must take their kids to see the movie. Flubber is a Walt Disney movie, and I generally don't like Disney for some unknown reason, I guess because it is reaching into the minds of children and manipulating them into clones of themselves. All of us who grew up on Disney has been forced into a Disney mindset. I am far more critical of children's movies, and those who specialise in them, because our children follow them more than adults. Adults watch movies, children believe movies.

It is, in that case, a great credit to the team behind this, the third Indiana Jones film of 1989 entitled The Last Crusade, and the fact they done what they've done in creating something as fun and as refreshing as what we've got.

Charging across Europe to Austria, father Henry joins the quest and makes for what is probably the best sidekick so far; blowing the likes of the previous entry's Capshaw character and Short Round out of the water and probably topping Allen's from the first.

Upon hearing this, he has dreams of a beautiful house and thus quits his job and flies straight to Louisiana to look at the property. Unfortunately a couple of bad things happen. The property needs a lot of work, the pink Cadillac has no breaks, and his attorney dies during the night this would be okay it is just that he was in bed with her at the time.Having just read the Ebert Review (and I don't particularly like many reviewers but I have come to the conclusion that Ebert actually puts a lot of thought into what he writes) I have a tendency to agree with him on the point that the movie is really just a string of clichés with a loose plot thrown in. The movie is a typical outsider coming into the traditional south were nobody particularly likes change. Fletch tries to be a romantic James Bond but really falls flat on his face, with the attractive real estate agent's, Betty Culpepper (Julianne Phillips), excuse I need to go to the toilet. Even the shower scene seems quite stupid.The movie is mildly amusing but no real laughs come from it (except the mildly hilarious Zippidy-doo-da song at the beginning). The amusement park Bible Land is supposed to be funny, but isn't, and the characters do not have those funny little traits that make movies interesting.Fletch Lives is supposed to be a mystery, but it doesn't come out as such. You realise that it involves dumping toxic waste when Fletch steps in some goo on a property when chasing a raccoon. Even before hand, somebody comments my garden is all dead and the suggestion that it is chemical waste being dumped. This completely eliminates the TV Evangelist, who is supposed to be the red herring, but when you hear that somebody is offering lots of money, one can assume that it is not Jimmy Lee Farnsworth who is behind it, especially since he uses his position to get it for nothing.Now, Jimmy Lee Farnsworth is worth a mention. He comes across as the typical, deceitful, TV evangelist. Basically we are being shown that they use modern technology to try and make people come to Christ. Just take a look around his complex and you will notice that Christ plays very little importance. The whole structure is based around him. Jimmy Lee does not build his church on Christ but rather on himself. He uses his charisma and modern technology to spread, what is essentially, a false gospel. When one comes to something like this, one should not write off Christianity because of people like these, but rather, one should return to the Bible to see what the true focus of the church, that is Christ, has to say. Christ is a solid foundation, Jimmy Lee is not. He cannot manage a family, as the movie states he has had two wives, and his daughter is easily seduced by Fletch into having an intimate relationship with him. And she is not resisting either.Finally, Frank the editor is strange. At the beginning, Fletch quits his job but later in the movie, he calls Frank and asks him to do some favours. Though this may be possible, I would expect that Frank would be less that hesitant to do these things for Fletch. Yet consider that Fletch is Frank's star reporter which means that he wants Fletch back. That is why Fletch gets a bigger office upon his return.

I haven't seen any films with Carole Lombarde before, and I already like her better than Catherine Hepburn and Ginger Rogers, and Ingrid Bergman. She was funny and her acting skills are far superior to Catherine Hepburn, who uses charm alone to captivate audiences. This can go the same for the actress who played Cornelia.

She was scatterbrained and spoiled and treated everything like a little pet, including Carlo, her Russian protégé. Arguably the funniest scene from this movie was Carlo's monkey scene when he tries to cheer up Irene. This film was endearing and funny, and largely a commentary on humanity.

That may sound funny to some, but I appreciate the film, because i have the chance to experience most of my senses, (touch, taste, smell, etc.)in which in most cases, i have not been able to do so, concerning other films. Time of the Gypsies, offers so many ideas and concepts freely, and viewers either have the chance to reach out and grab, or refuse all together. One idea\/ concept that went through my mind, was the idea of Death and Rebirth. To see this in the film-or physical representations of the concept, was great because usually films that try and and portray the concept, come out a little cheesy, and not believable. Furthermore,with this film, i believed, and in return, lived, breathed, and experienced. Kudos to Kusturica.

The role Tom Hanks plays and how he does justice to the character is impressive. Throughout a multitude of scenarios, the story of Forrest Gump truly keeps one entertained if not excited about what will happen next. Interestingly, a rather long movie, it did not make me feel When will this get over?. Not that I always ask this rhetoric question, mind you, but overall time passes without consideration of a break.With rather random occurrences, it is quite instigating to the viewer what is going to happen next. By not out of the blue but a frenzy of events which are not to be thought would happen in that chronological manner, this movie not only surprises but changes viewpoints. It delves with multiple issue, no matter how discreet and implicated.Generally, the genre of this movie applies to me but to see these genres posed like this truly enlightened me and rather than judging it harshly, made me reconsider to what extents the listed genres may apply to all cinema.
