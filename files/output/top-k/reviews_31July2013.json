This one line of the film says it all, this movie is all about hope, and things which you can relate to in your life. I became a huge fan of Freeman after watching this movie. Movie is bit slow in starting but builds up pace quickly. You start flowing with Andy and have a connect with him as the movie progresses. The story goes like this- Andy is send for life time imprisonment for allegedly killing his wife and her boyfriend,in jail first few years were really bad but slowly he starts to find friend and also some work.

I took a day or two to think about the ending and even went to the internet to see what actually happened and after I read a few things I decided I needed to see it again. I was fixed in this world and when I went to watch it again it was gone. I waited a few months and bought the director's cut on blu ray and I watched it again and the second time was so much more satisfying than the first.The story behind Donnie Darko is complicated to say the least. We follow Donnie, a troubled high scholar who just wants to be normal. It is hard to be normal when he is on psychotic medication and he hallucinates about a bunny rabbit named Frank telling him to do things in his sleep. Jake Gyllenhaal, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Patrick Swayze, and Drew Barrymore each have their own short story lines that tie into the main plot so perfectly. The writing in this movie was one of the best I have ever seen. Personally, the idea of time travel is so interesting and the idea of a tangent universe was new to me and I was hooked immediately. After seeing this movie I wanted to write something like it and it inspired me to say the least. Each character did such an amazing job with the strangeness of Barrymore and the odd feeling with Swayze. Their individual stories are almost as good as the main one following Donnie and his love interest. Gyllenhaal delivers in this movie as Donnie. He is troubled and another strong interest of mine if psychology and the mind. Donnie is incredibly gifted, smart, and opinionated. His story is so vague enough to keep the audience interested in the story as well as crept out. Frank was a scary character with a strong voice and seeing the bubble trail thing was unexpected. Noah Wile and Drew Barrymore are the only two teachers Donnie connects with in the entire school and their relationships are remarkable. With Barrymore especially, Donnie connects with her and her teaching style. Her role is never fully clear but she is effective. Maybe if I go back and watch it I will notice something else. That is the thing with this movie which is very rare, it gets better and better the more your watch it over and over. Noah Wile is a science teacher of some sort and after Frank mentions time travel Donnie goes to him for answers and every scene with Wile and Darko are together, my mind was blown and I was so interested. The conversations about wormholes and tangent universes and whatnot were so fascinating and it only works in a movie. The main relationship is between Donnie and Gretchen. Their relationship is so weird and cute at the same time. From the introduction of Gretchen she had a strong connection with Donnie and their relationship builds slowly and unexpectedly. Donnie has so much going on and as his methods of picking up girls are far-fetched and unrealistic but it was good enough for me. I still can't figure out what Gretchen saw in Donnie, you know because he is crazy, but I think she related to him and that was fine for me. Their relationship was unrealistic but for the universe the movie takes place in I bought it. Their ending was, in my opinion, controversial so let's get into it.I want to spoil this ending so bad and dive deep into my own thoughts but I really shouldn't. The entire movie builds up to one date, October 30, 1988. The movie is broken up into chapters and as the date approaches the scenes get more intense. It is supposed to be the end of the world and Donnie is afraid of the date and anticipating it. The beginning of this movie is slow and confusing but it picks up quickly. The beginning may be the one flaw but it has that one scene to keep it alive to keep the audience invested in the rest. Most of the questions are answered with more questions but the answers we get are so satisfying and the ending is outstanding. The star of this movie is the writing and the ending saved this movie from disaster and I still think about it every now and then. I am still trying to wrap my head around it because it left an impact. Out of all the confusing movies with a big ending this was one of the best. I felt so lost for the entire movie it was hard to stay invested but there was always that one scene to draw me back in and the ending was the icing on the cake. A total mind blow, especially the last shot. It was sort of an Inception shot at the way end with the topOverall, Donnie Darko has a cult following of a fan base so consider me a member. The clever writing kept me thinking and the ending was shocking and amazing. This movie is probably one of my favorites ever. Probably in my top 20 of all time. I noticed so many little things like in the beginning the first shot with Donnie's mother, she is reading IT by Stephen King and I took that as a sign. Spencer from iCarley and Seth Rogan are also in the movie very briefly but of course I notice that. Even the lyrics of the sings tied into the scenes perfectly and when Mad World came on at the end I lost it. Need I even say it, WillyT Seal Approval.

Late Mr. Ebert told in his review that Fiennes plays it too demented, as if the whole Nazi movement could be simply branded as evil- I disagree, it's subtle nuances in Fiennes's performance that show you how complex these characters really were.Cold, psychotic, resolute on the outside and torn apart with his lust for Jewish girl and the hardwired need to hate her people...

Only by watching this film and then dissecting it, can we truly appreciate its message- we are not born evil, we become evil when we fall under someone's spell and who intricately covers our eyes, by blaming everything that is wrong with our world, onto someone who is an easy target and can't defend for themselves...

When he goes in he is told that the hotel is closed for the season by a group who claim to be there to do some fishing. It isn't long before Frank and the Temples learn the truth about the 'guests'. They are gangster Johnny Rocco and his henchman; who are waiting to sell their illicit merchandise. Trapped in the hotel with armed gangsters inside and a hurricane raging outside things are about to get very dangerous!This Humphrey Bogart classic raises the tension nicely from the moment Frank enters the hotel until the final confrontation. Bogart is great as the laconic Frank and Edward G. Robinson is suitably villainous as Rocco; a man who is brave with a gun in his hand but cowardly in the face of real danger. Leading lady Lauren Bacall puts in a decent performance as Nora Temple but it is Claire Trevor who stands out as Rocco's Moll Gaye Dawn; a woman desperate for a drink. Most of the film displays its theatrical roots as it is set almost entirely within two rooms in the hotel; this is no bad thing though as it serves to provide a sense of claustrophobia&#x85; these people aren't going anywhere till the storm subsides. For the most part there is little real violence but there is enough to maintain a sense of danger without ever being really disturbing&#x85; this was of course made before people suffering from gunshot wounds bled in films!If you are a fan of Bogart this film is obviously a must see but even if you aren't it is well worth watching; it may be sixty five years old but apart from the odd word of slang hardly feels dated at all and the rules of the time mean there is no swearing or bloody violence which means there is nothing to offend anybody.

Bogart is great as the laconic Frank and Edward G. Robinson is suitably villainous as Rocco; a man who is brave with a gun in his hand but cowardly in the face of real danger. Leading lady Lauren Bacall puts in a decent performance as Nora Temple but it is Claire Trevor who stands out as Rocco's Moll Gaye Dawn; a woman desperate for a drink. Most of the film displays its theatrical roots as it is set almost entirely within two rooms in the hotel; this is no bad thing though as it serves to provide a sense of claustrophobia&#x85; these people aren't going anywhere till the storm subsides. For the most part there is little real violence but there is enough to maintain a sense of danger without ever being really disturbing&#x85; this was of course made before people suffering from gunshot wounds bled in films!If you are a fan of Bogart this film is obviously a must see but even if you aren't it is well worth watching; it may be sixty five years old but apart from the odd word of slang hardly feels dated at all and the rules of the time mean there is no swearing or bloody violence which means there is nothing to offend anybody. If you thing old movies are boring or black and white can't be exciting give this a go&#x85; you might change your mind.

If Murphy had went out on a high note on all of his funnier moments, which he could have easily done, Boomerang would have had a too cheesy comedic element, and it would have lost its smooth and suave attractiveness.

Well, Walt Disney started lining up more possible projects including more full-length animated features. He was considering many options for his second animated feature including Bambi (1942), Dumbo (1941), Alice in Wonderland (1951), Peter Pan (1953), and Fantasia (1940), all of which would become animated features later. Then, due to difficulties figuring out how to adapt the other stories to the big screen, Walt Disney finally decided for his 2nd animated feature to be Pinocchio (1940). This tale starts with a lonely wood carver named Gepetto finishing up on his newest marionette that he has called Pinocchio. He tells his two animal companions, a cat named Figaro and a fish named Cleo, that he wishes that Pinocchio was a real boy. One night, he gets his wish as a magical blue fairy brings this puppet to life. He isn't a real boy yet, but if he is able to prove his bravery, honesty and kindness, he will be one someday. Pinocchio is given a sidekick named Jiminy Cricket who will help him decide what's right or wrong and help make Gepetto proud. Now, Pinocchio is put to the test as he goes on many accidental misadventures such as becoming an actor, going to an island where you're allowed to do whatever you want (with a permanent price to pay, of course), and chasing down a monstrous whale. As was the case with Walt Disney's previous picture Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Pinocchio is exceptionally well animated. The backgrounds are so painstakingly well detailed that you practically notice something new in the backgrounds every time you watch it. In terms of its visuals, it pushed the envelope for what animated films could do with lighting, color, and other unique visual techniques. The music by Leigh Harline, Ned Washington, and Paul Smith is also worth commenting on. I think it's safe to say that all of us know how immortal and timeless the song When You Wish Upon a Star is. I think that playing this song during the opening credits was genius, since it's the best way to draw the audience's attention at the start of a film like this which is surprisingly darker than you might remember it being. It's intriguing the way the story convinces us how wrong it is to do whatever Pinocchio is manipulated into doing. For example, when Pinocchio tells a lie about why he didn't go to school to the blue fairy, his nose keeps on growing whenever he tells lie after lie. Another noteworthy example is when Pinocchio is manipulated into going to Pleasure Island where young boys smoke cigars, drink beer, play pool and other frowned upon activities for kids to be doing. After too much time there, the kids transform into donkeys that will be taken to work at the salt mines. The reasons why they somehow turn into donkeys are surreal to say the least, but let's just say this scene will scare off kids from smoking and drinking&#x85;.at least for a while. I could have done without a few scenes at the beginning, which were solely devoted to showing off the sound effects and the details in Gepetto's workshop as opposed to continue telling the story. I also thought that the ending to this film was sort of ripping off the ending from Snow White in a way that was less credible. If you've seen the ending to this film already, you'll know what plot device was used during that scene that I personally don't care for. Also, I have to agree with Internet video film critic Doug Walker (of the Nostalgia Critic fame) when he said that Jiminy Cricket doesn't hold up that well. While I agree that his sense of humor wasn't that good, I also thought Jiminy was way too careless, gave up too easily, and yet usually thinks he knows everything. There are more than a few scenes that show just how blatantly inconsistent his character is. Ultimately, what makes Pinocchio a great Disney movie more than 70 years after its initial release is the animation, the music, and the way it reinforces the main morals of its story onto its young audience. Even though Jiminy Cricket's somewhat good intentions backfired on me, I still liked Pinocchio himself. I admired how curious he was about the world around him, how positive his attitude was, and how clueless he was about what's good and what's bad. In other words, he felt like a real kid personality wise. This aspect and the ones I've mentioned before are good enough reasons why Pinocchio is a film that any Disney fan should take a look at.

One night, he gets his wish as a magical blue fairy brings this puppet to life. He isn't a real boy yet, but if he is able to prove his bravery, honesty and kindness, he will be one someday. Pinocchio is given a sidekick named Jiminy Cricket who will help him decide what's right or wrong and help make Gepetto proud. Now, Pinocchio is put to the test as he goes on many accidental misadventures such as becoming an actor, going to an island where you're allowed to do whatever you want (with a permanent price to pay, of course), and chasing down a monstrous whale. As was the case with Walt Disney's previous picture Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Pinocchio is exceptionally well animated. The backgrounds are so painstakingly well detailed that you practically notice something new in the backgrounds every time you watch it. In terms of its visuals, it pushed the envelope for what animated films could do with lighting, color, and other unique visual techniques. The music by Leigh Harline, Ned Washington, and Paul Smith is also worth commenting on. I think it's safe to say that all of us know how immortal and timeless the song When You Wish Upon a Star is. I think that playing this song during the opening credits was genius, since it's the best way to draw the audience's attention at the start of a film like this which is surprisingly darker than you might remember it being. It's intriguing the way the story convinces us how wrong it is to do whatever Pinocchio is manipulated into doing. For example, when Pinocchio tells a lie about why he didn't go to school to the blue fairy, his nose keeps on growing whenever he tells lie after lie. Another noteworthy example is when Pinocchio is manipulated into going to Pleasure Island where young boys smoke cigars, drink beer, play pool and other frowned upon activities for kids to be doing. After too much time there, the kids transform into donkeys that will be taken to work at the salt mines. The reasons why they somehow turn into donkeys are surreal to say the least, but let's just say this scene will scare off kids from smoking and drinking&#x85;.at least for a while. I could have done without a few scenes at the beginning, which were solely devoted to showing off the sound effects and the details in Gepetto's workshop as opposed to continue telling the story. I also thought that the ending to this film was sort of ripping off the ending from Snow White in a way that was less credible. If you've seen the ending to this film already, you'll know what plot device was used during that scene that I personally don't care for. Also, I have to agree with Internet video film critic Doug Walker (of the Nostalgia Critic fame) when he said that Jiminy Cricket doesn't hold up that well. While I agree that his sense of humor wasn't that good, I also thought Jiminy was way too careless, gave up too easily, and yet usually thinks he knows everything. There are more than a few scenes that show just how blatantly inconsistent his character is. Ultimately, what makes Pinocchio a great Disney movie more than 70 years after its initial release is the animation, the music, and the way it reinforces the main morals of its story onto its young audience. Even though Jiminy Cricket's somewhat good intentions backfired on me, I still liked Pinocchio himself. I admired how curious he was about the world around him, how positive his attitude was, and how clueless he was about what's good and what's bad. In other words, he felt like a real kid personality wise. This aspect and the ones I've mentioned before are good enough reasons why Pinocchio is a film that any Disney fan should take a look at.

This statement is one I would not even throw onto such horrendous films like Jack and Jill or Jaws The Revenge. This horrendous flop and waste of time was written, directed, and produced by Rod Amateau and is classified as one of the worst films of all time. The film tells the story of Dodger, a boy who is bullied and eventually meets the Garbage Pail Kids when his boss, Captain Manzini, brings their trash pail spaceship into his shop for safekeeping.The Garbage Pail Kids are a group of seven disgusting, I guess they are aliens, who come to the planet and have to be hidden for fear from Manzini and Dodger that they will be put in the prison for the ugly. From this comes the ironic moral of the story. The moral of the story is hypocritical at best. The moral is that ugliness is not on the exterior of someone, but their interior. This is where the hypocritical moral starts as the Garbage Pail Kids are overall bad people that would be going to jail in the universe the film is set in whether they were ugly or not. They constantly steal, including a truck, nearly run someone over, harass people who have done nothing to them, and destroy property. If you want to tell people that ugliness is on the inside, that is a fine moral, but then the people this is supposed to be shown about should not be as ugly on the inside as they are on the outside.There is a subplot of Dodger who wants to get the attention of his lead bully's girlfriend, Tangerine. To do this, he appeals to her sense of fashion by getting the kids to make him a fashionable jacket. After learning the truth, Tangerine decides to exploit the kids for her own personal gain by having a fashion show and claiming the kid's clothing to be her own.This is where the moral of the story comes into play with the terrible ending where Manzini and Dodger rescue the kids from the prison for the ugly and go to the fashion show. There, the kids rip the clothes off the models and terrorize the event. Tangerine is shown to be the ugly one because she was using people for her own self-interest. However, the kids are more in the wrong than Tangerine is and while I do not want to route for Tangerine, having her deal with the kids makes you want to route for her. The movie also fails with a target audience. A film like Aliens is for older audience while something like The Lion King is made for people of all ages. I guess this is targeted at kids but I do not think it would appeal to kids in the slightest, nor anyone else. From this, there is no audience that would enjoy this.There is little enjoyment that you can have from this film as everything is being taken too seriously. A film like Batman and Robin is bad but you can at least laugh at the awful pun lines that Mr. Freeze spouts out from time to time. The acting is taken too seriously so you can not even enjoy it when the acting is bad. In fact, for a comedy film, nothing is funny. The funniest thing is a poorly made sign on a building that looks like it was made with poster board and a permanent marker.If I could, I would give this film a 0\/10 on this website, but since I can't, I must bless this monstrosity with a 1\/10, giving the film more credit than it deserves.

","genre":"Action, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"31 July 2013","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" The remarkable thing about the Merchant-Ivory productions (in fact a solid triumvirate if we count the writer Ruth Prawer Jhabvala) is that they're generally less about plots than characters, and so real they never seem to act according to a specific screenplay, but are rather conditioned by the two main forces of the story space and time.Indeed, over the course of time, relationships are done and undone and the coldest heart can melt like Anthony Hopkins in The Remains of the Day. Howard's End was much about an estate, symbolizing the rural roots of British aristocracy, before it surrendered to business-driven modernism. Generally set at crucial periods of British history, the Merchant-Ivory productions are about people who are the products of their age while a new one is coming, and they generally use their houses as a symbolic stronghold to resist the ineluctable changes.And A Room with a View, adapted from E.M Forster's novel of the same name, is the metaphor of the very point the story makes. Even the smallest room can open onto a large town, the sky, the infinite, like so many paths one can take from life, if he or she dares to get rid of the weight of past and conventions. A room can be made of beds and austere furniture to welcome a young woman from a British hamlet, Lucy Honeychurch (Helena Bohnam Carter) and her restraining chaperon Charlotte (Maggie Smith), but it can offer a panoramic view of one of the most romantic towns in the world Florence.And the first pages of this cinematic book open in Florence, in a small pension, where a group of vacationers meet. Miss Charlotte complains about the missing view in the room, to which, invited during the following dinner, a free-spirited man, Mr. Emerson (Delnhom Elliott) proposes to switch their rooms. Emerson came with his son, and both belong to another class, high enough to afford a voyage to Italy, but whose philosophical views suggest that they embraced the turn-of-century, contrarily to the Victorian Charlotte, who refused the proposal, shocked by Emerson's lack of tact, while his reaction proves that he meant no disrespect. She eventually accepts, convinced by other guests of the pension, Reverend Beebe (Simon Callow) and the old Allan sisters.This benign episode foreshadows the coming conflicts between the old and new order in England circa 1910, to which space and time provide crucial elements. The film is set during the Edwardian period; a sort of in-between decade where British people could nonchalantly enjoy the achievements of the more prestigious Victorian era, like a historical calm before the storm of the Great War. And being a film of dazzling imagery, the sight of these British vacationers enjoying a picnic in a Tuscan setting, savoring tea and bathing under a sepia summer sun, and a cool summer breeze, is an eloquent illustration of the quiet optimism that prevailed during that period.And this bourgeois idleness, combined with a natural setting, creates the perfect cocktail for a passionate romance, leading to the inevitable moment when the mysterious George Emerson, played by the handsome Julian Sands, gives a passionate kiss to an unchaperoned Lucy. She didn't see it coming, nor did she expect the kiss' everlasting effect, awakening the most passionate impulses. The kiss sweeps off all the conventions, the good manners that condemned Lucy to a life of rigidity, giving all its meaning to the setting in Florence, the most defining town of the Renaissance. Literally, George's kiss is Lucy's renaissance.But this is only the first act and back home; the kiss is already history after Charlotte's intervention. And when during the next scene, we meet Cecil Vyse, Daniel Day-Lewis as Lucy's future husband, a living caricature of snobbish prig with his oiled hair, rigid stature and annoying noise clip, we're puzzled but not surprised. The film doesn't embarrass itself with explanations and trusts us enough to connect the events together. So, regarding the mysterious choice of Cecyl as a husband, I guess, we should get back to the 'room with a view' metaphor.Indeed, with George, Lucy had 'a room with a view', with Cecyl, she would have thousands of rooms with no view at all. Breaking his eternally taciturn facade, George is given one opportunity to have a heart-talk with Lucy; he tells her that her marriage with Cecyl would turn her into an ornament, for the man would never be able to value her, or any woman for that matter. This is one of the outbursts of passion the film serves at the right moment to remind us that there is still a story after all, and a question to which direction will Lucy's heart lean? And it's not just a choice between two men, but two orders, two states of mind, two kissing ways.Roger Ebert, in one of his most enthusiastic reviews, insisted on the conflict between heart and mind, passion and intellect. I wish he had a few words about space and time as either the restraining or catalyzing elements in our lives. It's restraining when you have characters with the privilege to enjoy some escapism in a beautiful Italian landscape, but are still tied to Victorian good manners, or catalyzing, when three men, including a priest, play like children in a lake, all naked. The swimming sequence is exhilarating, and the massive male nudity never bothers, a credit to the directing and the cast's performances.Of course, as enchanting as it is, A Room with a View is less politically oriented than other Ivory-Merchant productions while there was more to say about socialism, feminism, weight of traditions, bourgeois insouciance, but the specific pretension of A Room with a View was to depict another slice of British life, from which two hearts would converge in a small point of the world, a room with a view &#x85; on the infinite, on the future, on love.

Howard's End was much about an estate, symbolizing the rural roots of British aristocracy, before it surrendered to business-driven modernism. Generally set at crucial periods of British history, the Merchant-Ivory productions are about people who are the products of their age while a new one is coming, and they generally use their houses as a symbolic stronghold to resist the ineluctable changes.And A Room with a View, adapted from E.M Forster's novel of the same name, is the metaphor of the very point the story makes. Even the smallest room can open onto a large town, the sky, the infinite, like so many paths one can take from life, if he or she dares to get rid of the weight of past and conventions. A room can be made of beds and austere furniture to welcome a young woman from a British hamlet, Lucy Honeychurch (Helena Bohnam Carter) and her restraining chaperon Charlotte (Maggie Smith), but it can offer a panoramic view of one of the most romantic towns in the world Florence.And the first pages of this cinematic book open in Florence, in a small pension, where a group of vacationers meet. Miss Charlotte complains about the missing view in the room, to which, invited during the following dinner, a free-spirited man, Mr. Emerson (Delnhom Elliott) proposes to switch their rooms. Emerson came with his son, and both belong to another class, high enough to afford a voyage to Italy, but whose philosophical views suggest that they embraced the turn-of-century, contrarily to the Victorian Charlotte, who refused the proposal, shocked by Emerson's lack of tact, while his reaction proves that he meant no disrespect. She eventually accepts, convinced by other guests of the pension, Reverend Beebe (Simon Callow) and the old Allan sisters.This benign episode foreshadows the coming conflicts between the old and new order in England circa 1910, to which space and time provide crucial elements.
