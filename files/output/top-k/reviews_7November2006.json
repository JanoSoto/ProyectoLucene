[{"date":"7 November 2006","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" (r #101) Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu) was supposed to deliver a bag carrying 100,000 D-mark to drug dealer Ronnie, but accidentally lost the bag at the subway, where a bum picked it up. Manni desperately calls his girlfriend, Lola (Franka Potente), asking her for help. Lola finds herself in a position where she has to bring her boyfriend the missing 100,000 D-mark, by whatever means possible, within the next 20 minutes. It's an impossible situation come to life in an equally impossible movie a film ready to explode with bursting energy from frame one, and it does - Run Lola Run is an explosion of colours, style, a pulse-heightening soundtrack, and frenetic, out of control direction beyond Tony Scott's wildest dreams. Tom Tykwer has created a unique and utterly compelling masterpiece and one of few movies I can honestly call a must-see.Franka Potente is an average-looking German actress (no disrespect to her or her acting skills), in my humble opinion, but she is stunning, absolutely stunning, in this high-energy flick. Franka perfectly brings her off-the-wall, red-haired personality to life and I couldn't imagine anyone else playing the titular character. And her singing voice is great, as well! Of course, a movie as explosive and unapologetically entertaining and engrossing as Run Lola Run will have its detractors; this is not a film designed to appeal to as many people as possible. It is unique, no thriller made before or after it has ever come close to its intensity and thrills. Run Lola has been accused of being everything from shallow to stupid to pointless to MTV-styled (I can only shake my head at this complaint - you people have obviously never witnessed the horror that is MTV). Calling it pointless is to miss the point. This movie is meant to be stylized, roaring fun and nothing else. It's not meant to change your life, but it might be one of your best ever movie experiences.The film is, like I said, utterly explosive, with the rather more silent moments needed to help the film from becoming a noisy mess. Tykwer's direction is fantastic and his style incomparable. The movie is well acted, well written and often wickedly funny. The interesting idea of splitting one opening into three endings works brilliantly and will leave you asking yourself how much of what you just saw was real, and how much was just fantasy. No matter how you look at it, this is as entertaining as a movie can possibly get.Crank up the volume of your TV set or stereo and just enjoy the hell out of this mind-blowing adrenaline kick of a thriller. It will leave you wishing for more.
