I kept thinking of Life is beautiful and how upset I was with that film. By upset I mean disgusted with the premise. I could not imagine what that film wanted me to. Seven Beauties goes back to the exact same landscape and arrives at a completely different portrayal.I must confess that I consider Giancarlo Giannini to be one of the greatest actors ever to appear on film in any language. His style is different than say Al Pacino, Robert DeNiro or Jack Nicholson. With Giannini what always blows me away is what he can do with his eyes and simple facial gestures. Take for example the scene where in this film he is in court awaiting the sentence for murder. His eyes catches those of a young woman he had met in the street and with whom he does a light hearted bit of flirting. Their eyes meet and entire paragraphs of dialog go back and forth between them and not a word is spoken. I was just dumbfounded. Who acts this way anymore? Just about no one. His style often reminds me of the silent greats like Chaplin (in particular) who had to emote through their faces because the audience could not hear them speak.What is this film about? Is it just an anti-Nazi rant? Not really. Wertmuller at her best, had a full palette of dramatic colors splashing about and this is perhaps her best movie. Pasqualino Frafuso as a character is both hilarious, a complete puff-ball of inflated over confidence, a sole defender of his down and out family's honor and much more. As a bumbling tough-guy-wannabe, he manages to get himself into an insane asylum; perhaps the central motif of the entire movie. He moves from one insane chapter into another. (Major spoiler)...as a survivor, we are not sure what state of mind or soul he is in when he comes back to his family.There is a key element of the dialog mirroring the directors social ethos. When Pasqualino and another Italian soldier witness German soldiers killing (what they presume) are Jews and dumping their bodies into mass graves) and in fleeing the scene the other soldier is gripped with a terrible sense of guilt...we must take note of a key message. Should we turn away when gross injustice is done to our common man or should we protect ourselves with the certainty of silence? The concentration camp scenes are very harrowing but what is incredible in this film is that despite the utterly bleak reality, we can laugh a just a little bit. It is a macabre humor, very black and teetering on a dream like quality. I am reminded of some scenes in Fellini's Satyricon.The German commandant is a woman (most unlikely in real life) and is depicted in an over the top portrayal of life hating, totally unattractive female, who is all too aware that her war is going to wind down and she is on the loosing side. She absolutely hates the Italians she has to incarcerate and she barbarically enjoys killing them at random. That Pasqualino decides that he can seduce her is both comical and very sad at the same time. That he succeeds is beyond his or our own vivid imagination. The one thing he knew for sure was that as a very unattractive woman she most certainly was starved for sexual gratification, even if it must come from someone she hated and loathed. That is the deal with the devil he plays in order to eat and survive. Did he sell his soul to the dark side at this point? We do not get a clear answer and that is another strength in the drama. Wertmuller is telling us that there is always much more gray than colored outlines when we look to define moral limitations, and the choices made under enormous duress. What would we do to survive such hell? Are we so sure we would not lower ourselves to ANY level in order to survive? Many did and that is her point. We are not encouraged to take sides and judge. We are reminded that life sometimes takes over and we are washed away in currents much stronger than our simple moral and ethical compass we felt so sure of as a younger person.Ultimately this film satisfies as a monumental drama on so many levels. Pasqualino's sisters and mother (as actors) are outstanding, especially the eldest sister, who is made to look more ugly than ugly. The struggle to find a place in life with the burden of such horrid looks is held up in a severe way; however, we are also aware that it is over done and very exaggerated. Like some fulsome opera drama, her struggle to find safety, financial freedom and social esteem mirror the struggles of millions of others in the lower, working classes. A very familiar theme in Italian cinema. That her brother, another who felt himself to be an ugly duckling, manages to reach his own level of self-sufficiency, at the cost of hell on earth, ties a very nice parallel to her own travails. A family touched by tragedy on many levels, they miraculously survive the war intact.Seven Beauties is worth many viewings. A richly textured, very well written drama of very intense contrasts, a perfect vehicle for outstanding acting at both comedic and dramatic heights. One of the best films I've ever seen. My personal favorite of Giannini's, equal to or even surpassing his performance in Swept Away. Perhaps Wertmullers most coherent social commentary\/drama masterpiece.

One thing that makes The Hidden entertaining is the action since it moves a smooth and fast pace never making the movie drag or seem dull. The Hidden also has some nice effects for the time and budget such has the Alien, originally there was going to be a scene where the Alien grows bigger but it wasn't used in the film but even though it was removed the creature effect still looks effective. The acting in this movie is good, Kyle MacLachlan does a great performance. His character always seems calm and cool, the way he pulls this off is really effective for this film. Michael Nouri does a great job, his performance has the tough detective makes the two characters sort of contrast. Like most buddy cop movies the two main heroes never get along at first but has they proceed through the film they start to get more acquainted with each other like Lethal Weapon, Red Heat and Alien Nation. The plot of the film sees a man robbing a bank and then becomes pursued by the Police in a car chase, after running into an roadblock the man crashes his car and is shot by the cops. In the hospital the man reawakens and then transfers a slug like Alien creature into the other man's body taking control of it.

This doesn't always produce great films, but when the director is inherently cinematic, it often evokes something deep in the viewer. There is nothing in the world like looking on the face &#151; the person &#151; you are centered on. A million subtle decisions are made in each scene, summing to an effect that cannot be missed. If this had poor narrative qualities (and some of their films did) it would still have this quality of seeing into a soulmate deeply enough to be able to animate the skin.Its quite interesting when you consider the woman. If you see her outside of film, or in films made by ordinary eyes, she is quite ordinary. She has an atypical Chinese body busty and widehipped. She is poised but doesn't have the neck or cheekboned face of other Asian women. Only under this man's eye is she a goddess. You can see this in the very first shot.The second thing you can count on is the architectural anchoring of the thing. This man knows how to use space.

Its a sort of celebration that will send me into rich dreams, annotating my life.This has two known qualities that you, dear reader, can expect without knowing anything about the film itself.First, you will know that this is a woman directed by someone deeply in love with her. This doesn't always produce great films, but when the director is inherently cinematic, it often evokes something deep in the viewer. There is nothing in the world like looking on the face &#151; the person &#151; you are centered on. A million subtle decisions are made in each scene, summing to an effect that cannot be missed. If this had poor narrative qualities (and some of their films did) it would still have this quality of seeing into a soulmate deeply enough to be able to animate the skin.Its quite interesting when you consider the woman. If you see her outside of film, or in films made by ordinary eyes, she is quite ordinary. She has an atypical Chinese body busty and widehipped. She is poised but doesn't have the neck or cheekboned face of other Asian women. Only under this man's eye is she a goddess. You can see this in the very first shot.The second thing you can count on is the architectural anchoring of the thing. This man knows how to use space. He uses it in the cinematic narrative, for example, if you replay the shots where the house of death is shown, and then the last encounter with it... And if you understand why the decisions about handling distance and surfaces were made they way they were, you will have entered a zone where from now on you will not be able to reason without reasoning with place.But there are other handlings of space As with some of his other films, the building is a character. Its the noir narrator who sets the rules &#151; often arbitrary &#151; under which all characters are bound to operate, and which drives the narrative. Its a particularly western notion, this, and has gotten our hero in trouble, even banned. This part is following Welles and Kubrick. But he goes further than either of them with this notion that the light both has agency of its own (it selects which of the four wives gets a foot massage and sex) and is a part of the fabric of the buildings. The redness changes the spaces it occupies, bringing intrigue with the sex, desire for several things. Its quite layered, what is going on. These lanterns are the real master; in fact the person who inhabits the master's body is hardly even there. We never see his face.Because of the extensive use of hard planes and selfish light, there aren't many fabric effects here, as we'll see elsewhere.I am tempted to designate this as one of my two allowed must see before you die films of 1991. But I'm in too good a mood to make such a serious decision.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3 Worth watching. ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"19 March 2008","score":"","review":" Eleven Step Breakdown 1.

The whole plot of the movie is ridiculous -- how a mentally challenged person could go through or cause all these historical events and fads.

Whatever, I can live with the accents, but I prefer the exaggerated ones in Fargo (I thought they sounded cool). Anyway, now onto the acting Tom Hanks wasn't great in this movie at all. How hard is it to play somebody that doesn't change from one scene to the next. He walks, talks, and acts the same in every scene of the movie. This had to have been Hanks' easiest performance to play...and it won him his second Oscar. But of course this isn't the first time that's happened. See Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man, but at least that was a good movie.I like a lot of Robert Zemeckis's films by the way to include Who Framed Roger Rabbit? Contact and even Beowulf, but this one, he asked way too much for me to believe. I actually think the events of Star Wars 1-6 were more likely to have occurred than the events in this movie. A lot has been said about his right wing political agenda; I don't care; it's his movie, he can do what he wants with, but I don't have to agree. Also that this movie is stereotypical to blacks. I always wondered what African Americans thought about some of the stuff in it as I don't think it was meant to be racist, but some of it kind of came off like it.

I mentioned how much I hated the basic premise for this movie, but the dialog doesn't help either, with it's cheesy axioms and pathetic southern accents (I used to live in TN, and I don't remember the accents being that bad). Whatever, I can live with the accents, but I prefer the exaggerated ones in Fargo (I thought they sounded cool). Anyway, now onto the acting Tom Hanks wasn't great in this movie at all. How hard is it to play somebody that doesn't change from one scene to the next. He walks, talks, and acts the same in every scene of the movie. This had to have been Hanks' easiest performance to play...and it won him his second Oscar. But of course this isn't the first time that's happened. See Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man, but at least that was a good movie.I like a lot of Robert Zemeckis's films by the way to include Who Framed Roger Rabbit? Contact and even Beowulf, but this one, he asked way too much for me to believe. I actually think the events of Star Wars 1-6 were more likely to have occurred than the events in this movie. A lot has been said about his right wing political agenda; I don't care; it's his movie, he can do what he wants with, but I don't have to agree. Also that this movie is stereotypical to blacks. I always wondered what African Americans thought about some of the stuff in it as I don't think it was meant to be racist, but some of it kind of came off like it. I guess it's up to them to decide.Now onto the last part of my comment which doesn't have anything to do with why I like\/dislike any part of the movie. I've been called a Communist, un-American, and other worse things for hating this movie. Really what is the point. I don't put other people down for not liking movies I like. Everybody's is entitled to their own opinion. Furthermore, I thought I lived in (and fought for) a country where I can like or dislike whatever movie I want. I don't like movies because everyone else does, and just because Hollywood or the media says that a movie is good, doesn't mean that it is. In fact I tend to disagree with Hollywood a lot. Anyway, isn't having to like something that's jammed down my throat communist in itself? Anyway, if I had to choose between becoming a communist and liking this movie, I would choose communism without a second thought or regret.If I was rating this movie on how much I actually liked it, I would give it a -infiniti just on the stupid screenplay alone. Too bad, it took awhile for The Shawshank Redemption to get popular, or that would have swept the Oscars that year.

I am afraid that I never read the book and frankly, this was one of the most confusing movies that I have ever tried to watch in a long time. I get a bit confused on the number of flashbacks between the nurse, the patient and the man with no thumbs. The film didn't even really explain what they were looking for in the desert until they found it; or even how in the world they all knew each other to come together.After recently seeing the Pride and Prejudice movie with Colin Firth, I have been trying to do a study on his film career by watching other movies of his, and bluntly, other than What a Girl Wants I am not finding much where he played in that was any good. I am definitely not saying that HE wasn't good. He is really one of the best actors I have seen in the modern day film, but the content and quality of the films he plays in have a lot to be desired.The English Patient is another perfect example of where the director, writer, and crew are just too close to their subject matter to see that the viewer is not getting the picture &#150; literally. The entire movie seemed to be to showcase Ralph Fiennes as a dramatic actor with long periods of emoting that was a bore. Nothing is really explained and every one of the subjects from the beginning seems to need a psychoanalyst evaluation! Kristin Scott Thomas' character seems to enjoy describing erotic stories standing in front of a totally male audience and titillating other men other than her husband; Colin Firth, who plays her husband, does not necessarily have all his marbles in place and is supposed to be a secret agent &#150; I guess; and Ralph Fiennes walks around like a Roman Mr. Darcy (sorry, Colin!) who thinks he knows it all. The rest of the cast is cast (pun intended) to the four winds as the plot wanders on.The subplot of the mental stability of the nurse (Juliette Binoche) and her motives and involvement with Naveen Andrews is another confusing element that leaves the viewer with an unsavory taste. But of course, the viewer is still reeling how in the world the first two characters (Thomas and Fiennes) ended up having sex the first time anyway. What was the attraction? There was no chemistry and no build-up. Just a slap, bam, thank you! And isn't it romantic that Fiennes ended up a traitor helping the Germans by giving them maps to the desert? (sarcasm) To describe this movie, I would have to simply say, How to impress your gynecologist with your mammograms and cheat on your sweet, adorable husband who loves you. The final unbelievable section of this plot is to fathom how anyone would choose Ralph Fiennes over Colin Firth. Firth had very little opportunity to demonstrate any of his acting talents &#150; in fact, when watching the movie, I thought it must have been one of his first. The scene where he had been waiting for his wife all night was perhaps the only two second clip that is worth seeing in the movie. At that, I have no interest in watching it again.The best scene I liked was the plane crash where Firth is trying to take them all out. Too bad he missed! It would have saved an extra twenty minutes of even more fruitless film. Aerial desert scenes were pretty neat, though.

After a very successful college career, he landed a choice spot on the Olympic team. However, during an important game, Doug was severely injured when an opposing player decked him. Although he made a recovery, his vision was substantially altered, making it impossible for him to return to the game of hockey. He now works construction in wintery Minnesota. Kate Mosley (Moira Kelly) is a spoiled little rich girl who resides in a Connecticut mansion where she has her own ice rink. Although she has also been an Olympic contender in the ice skating pairs competition, her uber-diva personality has interfered with her medal count and her ability to hold onto her partners. Now, Kate is searching for a new man to skate with her and her very respected Russian coach, Pamchenko (Roy Dotrice) is offering Doug as a possibility! Who is he kidding? Doug is a HOCKEY player, not an ice artist. Yet, Pamchenko insists on a trial partnership and, lo and behold, Kate and Doug start to become the dynamic duo of the skating world. But, with Kate's prickly personality and Doug's own bossy demeanor and wandering eyes, can they manage to stick together long enough to win any darn competitions? We'll see! This is a most enjoyable and romantic film, especially made for those who also adore the lovely sport of ice skating. Sweeney and Kelly are near perfect as the sparring partners who may just harbor some loving feelings for each other. Dotrice is a stitch as the Russian Coach while Terry O'Quinn does a nice turn as Kate's father. All other lesser players are well chosen, too. As for the costumes, especially the skating garments, they are quite fetching and the settings are beautiful, too, particularly the home and grounds of Kate's Connecticut residence. Then, too, the script is funny and touching while the direction is lively and sharply edited.

The mythology (which is given the once over) has potential as well, and still somewhat makes sense if you think about it. It seems Freddy lost all of his souls and was powerless, but is reborn in a dream and instead of using Alice, he's using her unborn fetus (?!) as the new bearer of souls for Freddy. The movie could have been done quite well, but the movie has only one interest, to make money. The production was given 6 weeks of shooting, and 6 weeks of editing, the script was the least of anyone's concerns as constant rewrites were done, but as long as there was deaths and SFX, hopefully it won't show.

Well, it was disappointing not because of Marilyn - she was fine - but the story was incredibly stupid.Part of the problem might be the way our society has changed, although I doubt even 50 years ago - when this film came out - a guy could do what Bo Decker (Don Murray) did in here and get away with it. Nonetheless, to watch this brainless idiot - in a crowded nightclub - chase a woman down, rip off half of her dress, break into her dressing room, follow her out the window to a bus station, lasso her and kidnap her by dragging her onto the bus.....and have NOBODY even attempt to stop him during all of this (and more) is a real insult to any viewer's intelligence. No police? No security? No harassment, et al? The story, like Murray's character who has fewer brains than the rodeo animals he's battling, is just plain dumb. Monroe (Cheri) and friend Eileen Heckart (Vera) are fine, as is the other main character, Virgil (Arthur O'Connell) but Murray is so loud, abrasive and stupid that he ruins the movie. He - not Monroe - dominates the film, unfortunately.Thankfully, Monroe is.....well, Monroe, so all is not lost watching this movie but this screenplay is so dated and so moronic you'll cringe watching the film.

Even though job works fine for Seth he wants something bigger, so he gets a chance when Greg (Nicky Katt) and Michael (Tom Everett Scott) come to his casino. Greg and Michael are young and successful brokers and they invite Seth to join them at company called J.T. Marlin. Finally Seth thinks that he's doing something that would please his dad and something that is legal. Seth soon meets brokers like Jim Young (Ben Affleck) and Chris Varick (Vin Diesel), nice secretary Abbie Halpert (Nia Long); but he also begins to realize what are people at J.T. Marlin selling to others.After very good movies like Wall Street and Glengarry Glen Ross, we've got another story about brokers named Boiler Room. Boiler Room is definitely not better from these two movies but it represents watchable movie and that is not bad. Maybe there are some clichés like the love story between Seth and Abbie or very stretched relationship between Seth and his dad (we've seen it all before), but as I said before you can easily pass over that. Ribisi is good in main role and I also liked Diesel (except that last scene on stairs). The acting coming from Affleck is very bad and he wasted some of the best lines this script has to offer. Ben Younger did a good job in his directorial debut, but his movie suffers from innovative plot ideas that could take it on to another level (the ending). Instead we've got only solid but not really memorable movie.

The film is a quest to foil Nazi plans to get a hold of the grail to obtain eternal life and Indy must stop them in addition to save his father with whom his relationship is poor.Unlike Temple of Doom, Last Crusade goes down the religious artifact path that Raiders used to launch Indiana Jones into the mainstream of iconic characters and great Hollywood films. While these films are more about the action and the humor and Harrison Ford anyway, at least unlike Temple of Doom the plot is not so absurd that it detracts from those elements to an extent.Connery as Jones' father adds another humorous aspect and depends Jones' character. More so than ever, we get a sense of who Indiana really is, not merely what he does and why he does it. The opening scene with River Phoenix as young Indy is not only clever but truly telling of the famous hero.The action sequences, Ford's persona, and the cleverness of it all never disappoint and for that to happen in the third installment of a series is simply outstanding. Indiana Jones will forever define adventure and the series' imprint on Hollywood action film-making is solidified more than ever in Last Crusade.
