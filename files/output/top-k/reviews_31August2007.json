This would appear to be another in a long line of films spoofing the James Bond spy craze of the sixties, specifying the female perspective (Modesty Blaise; Fathom), but is more like just another in a long line of successful Doris Day comedies. Ms. Day was usually partnered with the likes of Rock Hudson or James Garner, leading men specializing in light comedy. In this case, her partner is Rod Taylor, who had just starred as The Liquidator the year before. Here, he's a very successful aeronautics engineer who has just invented a new formula for duplicating gravity while one flits about in outer space. Naturally, enemy agents would love to get their hands on this formula. Day's character, a widow, divides her time between a tour guide job at NASA, taking college courses and helping her dad by pretending to be a mermaid whenever he conducts one of his sightseeing tours from his glass bottom boat (hence, the title; yet, this boat plays no part in the plot except in the very beginning of the movie). Her dad is played by then-famous TV\/Radio personality Godfrey, who didn't really star in films until then. Taylor accidentally snags Day when he goes fishing and she becomes bottomless, quite a suggestive scenario for those days, especially in Day comedies. Day continues her adorably furious posturing, setting up the requisite sexual tension between the two leads.The two leads slowly but surely hook up, in standard sappy, if silly, romance clichés, despite Day's preposterous predilection for clumsiness - she's a walking disaster area, very similar to some female characters in a couple of Matt Helm films and even the Bond films themselves. Taylor's character represents modern technology and progress; he's one of those guys who will be responsible for all of us getting around in flying cars at some point in the future. There are a few amusing scenes in Taylor's very modern house, where he shows off some gadgets to Day in his kitchen; I suppose it's a sad comment on how far we've progressed in the past 40 years that some of these still look very advanced. The whole spy angle really kicks in during the last third, during Taylor's house party, when all his compatriots are convinced that Day is a foreign spy. Seems she's been making weird phone calls to some guy named Vladimir and running off some numbers. Of course, the audience knows who Vladimir really is and this sets up the characters proceeding on a false assumption, which we get to snicker at. There's also the matter of who the real spy is. We've seen this before, many times, but the actors make it entertaining; Lynde is goofy as the head of security and Dick Martin is especially funny as Taylor's buddy. Dom DeLuise shows up in an early role, playing off of Day in some crude slapstick; he's better in his last scenes. Day & Taylor make a pretty good match, breezing through the romantic stuff. It's also interesting to see actor Fleming, who had just finished his long-running role on TV's Rawhide and died soon after this in a drowning mishap.

In todays standard this movie would still be a great movie however in my ratings It barely made it out as a 4 star.The movie depicts Patton to be a much greater icon then the actual history that precedes him. Erwin Rommel of the Germans was portrayed to have utmost respect in Patton and his men when in reality he didn't care much for Pattons troops but rather had respect for his arch nemesis Montgomery. Knowing that it takes a bit away from the film however the overall performance still makes it quite a epic to watch.It can become very slow at times and is intended on being a bio-pic so really the base of this movie is to present the character Patton and some of the events that occurred during his time at war. I would recommend this film to movie goers who love army films without the battles and rather just after math sequences.

She struggles with revealing her deepest needs. She longs to be close to someone and have a friend to talk to, but instead she watches from her window with binoculars. She observes those around her and thinks she might know what might make them happy. She studies them, takes notes, and executes a plan. If special ops needed a happiness agent, Amelie would be their woman.When she was a girl, she had two type-A parents. Her father would never touch her, except when he gave her a medical exam. Her mother's greatest joy was cleaning her purse out. Amelie's only friend was a goldfish with suicidal tendencies. Now, as a grown woman, she works in a café. She watches a male painter in his flat below. He never leaves his apartment because of frail limbs. Amelie's father is now widowed and never leaves his home, either. She is surrounded by unhappy people and Amelie is drowning in their discontent.One day, her life changes when she finds a small music box containing a little boy's treasures. She makes a decision. She will hunt down the box's owner. If it makes him happy, she will spend her days doing secret good deeds for others, finding happiness in their fortune. She becomes the good fairy, hiding in the shadows as others dance for joy at a new lover, a lost loved one found, and a look at the world outside.The movie is done in French with English subtitles. It was refreshing to watch this story about someone who simply longs to bring good to the world. Whenever one of her victims brims with happiness, Amelie's shy smile brightens up her face. The cinematography was well done with bright colors. You want to enter this world of fruit stands, fairs, and amusement parks. You want to jump on Amelie's shoulder and ride around with her on one of her adventures. This was a must-see movie for cinema lovers. When it ended, and Amelie rode off with someone that made her happy, the music soaring in the background, I smiled and sighed with wonder.

She was how I imagined Snow White would look minus the rosy cheeks dark brown hair, gooey chocolate-colored eyes, perfect skin, and red lips. Amelie is painfully shy. She struggles with revealing her deepest needs. She longs to be close to someone and have a friend to talk to, but instead she watches from her window with binoculars. She observes those around her and thinks she might know what might make them happy. She studies them, takes notes, and executes a plan. If special ops needed a happiness agent, Amelie would be their woman.When she was a girl, she had two type-A parents. Her father would never touch her, except when he gave her a medical exam.

Top billing here is Patrick Swayze who was in big demand at this time by Hollywood, was able to put to to good use his physical dexterity and dancing skills to to play a martial arts expert who is a head bouncer in this testosterone laden movie. There are a lot of good character actors in support, some great dialog and plenty of brawls to keep your attention.It's mostly a guy movie but it has it's chick moments although their contribution is not really very memorable,however more importantly it's a good verses evil movie! It's not a new concept there have been many similar themes over the years and the one that in many ways stands out was the 1950's western  Shane. It very much resembled this i.e. a new kid in town who stands up to the local heavy and mobilizes and encourages the terrified locals to aid him!Personally I never cared for bouncers, I used to enjoy provoking them just to see how far I could get before they got violent, also I witnessed a fight outside a club once where the bouncers themselves were badly beaten up by some thugs, therefor this movie aroused my attention. Patrick Swayze plays Dalton who has a reputation in the night club scene as a top cooler. This position is somebody who over sees the bouncers and make sure that nobody gets out of line. Although he has a degree in philosophy, Dalton uses his martial arts skills to work in the night club business and consequently gets head-hunted by a club owner from a small town in Kentucky who persuades Dalton to help him clean up a night spot called the Double Duce. The only condition Dalton insists on is that he gets well remunerated (he gets what he wants - no negotiation!) and demands cart blanche i.e. what he says goes and he has the final word!After driving down (he doesn't fly , it's too dangerous -- how ironic!) and after visiting the club he realizes that this place is a slaughterhouse that will only attract trouble makes and low-lives. He soon gets up to speed and marks the thugs and decides that some of the bouncers themselves who relish the violence are as much a part of the problem as anything else, (not at all unusual by the way). Dalton soon assets himself and starts to sort things out and get rid of the bad apples the the place starts to resemble a reasonable night spot.However, what the owner doesn't tell Dalton is that the town itself is run by a local hood and entrepreneur Brad Wesley (Ben Gazzara) aided and abetted by his hired muscle. Not only does Wesley have relatives that have been fired by Dalton but he also has designs on the club it self. Wesley soon realizes that Dalton is not some Johnny come lately and nor will not be a push over because after a couple of encounters with Dalton and his newly trained bouncers his goons come off second best.When Dalton cannot be bought off or reasoned with into joining his organization, he lets his top enforcer the intimidating Jimmy (Marshall Teague)off the leash to really crank up the pressure. Dalton realizes that he's going to need help and asks legendary cooler Wade Garret (Sam Elliot) to join him down at the Double Duce. What makes it even more complicated and really irks Wesley is that one of his former girlfriends who has not only rejected him but takes a fancy to Dalton, so Wesley tries to get to him by using his morality and good conscience against him.By intimidating the locals by destroying their businesses he hopes to turn the locals against him or else force Dalton into leave town as to save their livelihoods. Dalton does not back down and up to this point it's just gratuitous violence and intimidation, however after a show down between Jimmy and Dalton that results in a shocking conclusion, all bets are off and killing and burning down buildings are now fair game.Never the less it's great entertainment, enjoyable to watch although you shouldn't take it too seriously. Two things to point out there is not a cop to be seen in this movie until the very end, also special mention has to go to one of Wesley's henchman the hapless O'Conner who was not only twice on the receiving end of a Dalton beating but also suffered the indignity of a public dressing down and got slapped about by Wesley. This was for not measuring up to what Wesley had come to expect from his men as well as the inability to endure pain! Never the less there he is at the end still working for Wesley, the unemployment line would surly have been a better option at this stage! Well there you have it, grab the pop corn sit back and enjoy Dalton and co take out the trash and send people to barbers college!!

The fairly routine script by Stirling Silliphant & Dean Riesner which was apparently originally called 'Moving Target' takes itself pretty seriously & just isn't that good I'm afraid, it's well short on action & set-pieces, the story is dull & turns out to be nothing more than a simple kidnapping & as a whole it never got me going. The bad guy's are also underused here, they barely feature at all & after the first few minutes they completely disappear until near the end, the main bad guy Bobby Maxwell has to be one of the weakest on screen baddies ever, he doesn't get any decent lines, he doesn't get much of an opportunity to be evil & he puts up virtually no resistance at the end as Harry blows him away. The one aspect of the film I did like was Harry's partner, I did think The Enforcer was going to turn into a mismatched cop buddy buddy type flick as he is paired up with a woman but it doesn't quite work out that way & while there's mutual respect by the end it never falls into the established clichés. In a way The Enforcer could be described as the very first mismatched partner action flick but it doesn't follow the same path many other's would take after 48 Hrs.

There's no car chases, very few shot outs, one fight & little in the way of anything spectacular or particularly memorable including a rushed ending. The Enforcer has a somewhat sedate pace & I just found myself losing interest at various points, the whole film just feels lacklustre & like no-one had any enthusiasm apart from Tyne Daly who is pretty good in this a full 6 years before her stint as New York cop Lacey in Cagney & Lacey (1982 - 1988).Technically the film is alright, there's nothing here that stands out as being particularly good or bad although I really hated some of the 70's style jazz music that played in the background especially during the scene when Harry chases the black dude. Actually shot in San Francisco & on Alcatraz this definitely has a somewhat gritty 70's feel to it. The acting is OK but nothing special.The Enforcer is an average 70's cop thriller, it doesn't really have enough action for modern audiences tastes & the story itself isn't anything to shout about either. It's OK but nothing special.

I had seen her in other things, but never really put it to brain, that I really enjoyed her stuff. But here, is a fast fun and totally fantasy driven story of Beverly Hills and the rich women who have some one to compete with. Enter Meryl Streep! I was a fan from the finish of the film, 'Silkwood' (1983) with Cher and Kurt Russell, what a strong performance, she brought to that. Karen, (the main female lead) who Streep was portraying in 'Silkwood', she did, I say with zero regret. She delivered 100%. Now, Goldie comes into this story, and by the way I have always loved Kurt Russell, her man's roles. Kurt has the 'goods' when it comes to big or small screen. But as for Goldie this Zemekis directed fun-weirdo fest was just what got me thinking, ah, Goldie Hawn...wow! I loved the story, a woman learns of a potion that will enable her to live beyond life and cross-over to immortality. She has to have it to out do her rival, that stole her man when she (Goldie) was overweight and a sniveling loser. Actually, she was just Miss understood. Bruce Willis, her boyfriend turned Streep's character's husband, brought a wonderfully colorful old guy character that had a whimsical sense, not unlike Television's happier days 'Moonlighting's' D.A. (David Addison) but, not being Addison. Versatile, versatile, versatile, that is what Willis can be and it amazes me.He was the frustrated older Doctor (and genius) that got caught between a rock and a hard place, in Death Becomes Her (1992) Willis had that older confused, then suddenly enlightened Dr. Ernest Menville down. I can't see someone doing just what he did in that role. I laughed and laughed some more. Meryl as Madeline or 'Maddy' Ashton, was a wonderfully conceited, pain in the ass character, complete with menacing attitude when she wanted her way desperately more than to do the right thing. She pushed and she pulled, until Ernest could bare it all no more. Even when both women, Helen and Maddy wanted for the good Doctor to go along with them on their immortal adventure. He simply cut and ran, leaving them well behind.Director Robert Zemeckis, has a way of bringing out and presenting his story in such a way that brings you to a totally visual as well as audio understanding of the situation, I think and not simply a well made over-view. He has a way with comedy\/drama that is highly satisfying...i.e Back To The Future Tri-series (1985-1990)to his simpler and belly laugh-funny UsEd CaRs (1980) Robert is one of my all time favorite directors. The cast was the fun and the story set the entertainment level on the events played out just right and the ending even, was a nice turn that made the joke on the two vindictive, greedy rich opportunist tramps in competition with each other, to a little more dependent more of a team effort. Even though through the end from what they should have learned they are still not, straight players, even when they both depend on each other for that. This was a great time. A date-night fun romp, or even solo. But I recommend a good bottle of wine and a date anytime over alone.

I had seen her in other things, but never really put it to brain, that I really enjoyed her stuff. But here, is a fast fun and totally fantasy driven story of Beverly Hills and the rich women who have some one to compete with. Enter Meryl Streep! I was a fan from the finish of the film, 'Silkwood' (1983) with Cher and Kurt Russell, what a strong performance, she brought to that. Karen, (the main female lead) who Streep was portraying in 'Silkwood', she did, I say with zero regret. She delivered 100%. Now, Goldie comes into this story, and by the way I have always loved Kurt Russell, her man's roles. Kurt has the 'goods' when it comes to big or small screen. But as for Goldie this Zemekis directed fun-weirdo fest was just what got me thinking, ah, Goldie Hawn...wow! I loved the story, a woman learns of a potion that will enable her to live beyond life and cross-over to immortality. She has to have it to out do her rival, that stole her man when she (Goldie) was overweight and a sniveling loser. Actually, she was just Miss understood. Bruce Willis, her boyfriend turned Streep's character's husband, brought a wonderfully colorful old guy character that had a whimsical sense, not unlike Television's happier days 'Moonlighting's' D.A. (David Addison) but, not being Addison. Versatile, versatile, versatile, that is what Willis can be and it amazes me.He was the frustrated older Doctor (and genius) that got caught between a rock and a hard place, in Death Becomes Her (1992) Willis had that older confused, then suddenly enlightened Dr. Ernest Menville down. I can't see someone doing just what he did in that role. I laughed and laughed some more. Meryl as Madeline or 'Maddy' Ashton, was a wonderfully conceited, pain in the ass character, complete with menacing attitude when she wanted her way desperately more than to do the right thing. She pushed and she pulled, until Ernest could bare it all no more. Even when both women, Helen and Maddy wanted for the good Doctor to go along with them on their immortal adventure.

His novels have, not surprisingly, provided considerable material for films. At least two (CARRIE; THE SHINING) are considered to be masterworks, while many others have been surprising clinkers (MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE; PET SEMETARY). CHRISTINE, an adaptation of King that came out in theaters only eleven months after the book's first printing, is one of the better King adaptations; for while it is not a complete masterpiece, at the very least it provides enough scares and suspense without resorting to the graphic violence that has so often plagued the horror film since the end of the 1970s.Although the novel's setting has been changed from western Pennsylvania to southern California in the film, the basic spirit of the novel remains intact, as does the year it's set in--1978. Keith Gordon is the gawky high school teenager who manages to fall head over heals for a 1957 rustbucket of a Plymouth that the owner (Roberts Blossom) calls Christine. Lacking self-esteem, and often the target of a group of bullies in school, he presses forward with buying this seemingly decrepit piece of automotive machinery, despite the extreme protestations of his family, and even his closest friend (John Stockwell). In short order, Gordon manages to restore Christine almost to the condition in which it came off the assembly line in Detroit--complete with a radio that plays only the good stuff from the 50s.But what nobody realizes is that Christine is both possessive and possessed. An evil force resides beneath Christine's chassis, and it makes no bones about what it'll do to anyone who gets between it and Gordon. Gordon's new-found girlfriend (Alexandra Paul) almost chokes to death on a hamburger while inside the car; the uncouth garage owner (Robert Prosky) at whose establishment Gordon has kept his '57 jewel dies in it; and several of Gordon's high school tormentors bite the dust at the hands of Christine. A tough-nosed cop (Harry Dean Stanton) tries to connect Gordon to these horrible events, but has only circumstantial evidence. Finally, in fear of their own lives, Stockwell and Paul confront Christine inside Prosky's abandoned garage, hoping to somehow get Gordon out of the car's evil grasp.Apart from a slight excess of profanity in the script (and this is merely a small caveat), CHRISTINE is an atmospheric film, chock full of suspense, thanks to the solid direction of John Carpenter (HALLOWEEN; THE FOG). In contrast to most other King adaptations to come, and the vast majority of Carpenter's own output following it, CHRISTINE relies on plot and tension, with its suburban setting being the perfect place for the terror unleashed during the night. The violence, for the most part, is implied in the Hitchcock tradition; there is only a limited amount of blood and gore. Stockwell and Paul do great supporting work; and while Gordon's performance as the high school kid who becomes possessed is a bit less sympathetic than he should be, it still works for the story. Carpenter's and Howarth's synthesizer-dominated score ups the film's suspense quotient; and the ploy of using a lot of 1950s rock and roll on the soundtrack is very much in keeping with the spirit of King's novel.While CHRISTINE does fall just slightly short of the masterpiece status attained by CARRIE and THE SHINING, one could do far worse, in the horror genre in general and King in particular, than to watch this film. It had become a rarity by the 1980s for a horror film to be anything more than a matter of how much gratuitous sex, violence, and bad acting could be put on the big screen. CHRISTINE eschews that for something far superior great, suspenseful, and terrifying cinema.

As Shakespeare falls for a girl high above his rank, pursues her in shadows and behind stage walls, and comes to blows with her noble suitor and the whole of England, the action of Shakespeare in Love and scenes of Romeo and Juliet weave in and out of each other with style and grace.Stories such as these can usually be called contrived, and indeed might be called such here, but somehow, I just don't care. Maybe it's the artist in me, or maybe (and more probably) it's the acting, directing, and screen writing, but I couldn't help but be charmed, pulled in, and thoroughly affected by this wonderful film. At every turn the acting and writing managed to provide beautiful romance while sidestepping the dangers of being stilted and contrived as the two stories are made to coincide. The result is a natural, livable story that disarmed me and kept me with it dramatically. Paltrow's radiance and range pulled me in and I fell in love with her just as Shakespeare was. Fiennes's performance was just unassuming enough--then explosive!-- to make me let my guard down, empathize, fear, and hope with his character. The glorious ensemble cast, including the indomitable Judi Dench and the realistic and human Geoffrey Rush put the last nail in the coffin of any doubts.

And four out of the five are treatable. Of course Crystal was jokingly referring to the Agent as being beyond help. Among the figures of sports and entertainment, agents are often regarded as the necessary evil of the industry often with reputations as being the sleaziest of VIP's, just-above used car salesmen. Their antics which require a high-level of tough negotiations are sometimes seen as money-gouging and materialistic. In the film Jerry Maguire, Tom Cruise decides to wear the shoes of a sports agent and walk around in them for just over two hours.Who am I, and what am I doing? Jerry Maguire asks when he realizes his sports agency, SMI, tries to cover up the darker aspects of professional sports. His answer is inspiring, transcendent, and detrimental. He mistakenly writes down his inspired thoughts and submits them to his colleagues for suggesting the agency concentrate better on fewer clients. For his inspiration, he loses his place at his agency and many of his highest-paying clients to his rival Bob Sugar. Subsequently, he also loses his attractive but shallow fiancé. Maguire is forced to try and live his dream of being more caring and receptive towards the needs of his clients rather than just being there to get a slice of his athlete\/clients' multi-million-dollar paychecks. In a particularly poignant sequence, he retains his client Frank Cush Cushman who is a leading contender in the NFL draft through a handshake with his father, played by Beau Bridges. However, on draft day, he learns through an unexpected phone call that his rival Bob Sugar, through deception, convinced Cushman to sign with him instead. Now, Maguire has retained only Tidwell, and he must create his new agency from the ground up with only a single client as his starting point.So the question asked of the movie is Can a sports agent find a more meaningful, possibly spiritual, life and still acquire the high-paying clientèle? And maybe even more to the point, can an agent make a difference beyond just being a high-powered money negotiator? Jerry Maguire is a thoroughly entertaining riches-to-rags-to-transcendence story of a fantasy sports agent trying to find a deeper purpose to an otherwise materialistic existence.The film works at almost all levels, particularly because of the dynamism of Tom Cruise and Cuba Gooding Jr. in an Academy Award-winning performance, playing the only client willing to stay with Maguire. Part of the story is Maguire's journey from the purely material to a deeper and more-satisfying existence. Rod Tidwell (Gooding), wide receiver for the Cardinals, is a strange opposite to Cruise but has a similar problem. Tidwell is a devoted father and husband, emotionally involved with his family but does not quite give that same heart on the football field. The story becomes about both characters finding something deeper in their place in the world, Gooding giving what he gives to his family to his team, and Cruise giving to his clients and co-worker\/lover Dorothy Boyd his love and attention. Renee Zellweger plays Dorothy Boyd in a passionate and sensitive performance that will definitely bring tears. Zellweger's son becomes an important character and also an inspiration to Cruise to find the deeper and more sensitive part of himself.In the materialistic world of late 20th-century America, Jerry Maguire is a breath of fresh air. A rare story produced by the money-obsessed film studios about the dangers of losing oneself for the sake of self-promotion and monetary gain. An interesting statistic has emerged of late regarding a high number of American businessmen on their deathbeds who begin regretting the direction and purpose of their lives. Jerry Maguire offers an alternative, although probably few in his position would find the wisdom to change course. But since you can't take it with you, life is about what you leave behind.

While considered one of the weaker entries in the series overall, Episode VI has perhaps the best and most satisfying ending of the six.The motif of nature versus technology occurs most visibly in this episode. The difference is highlighted through colors and image patterns - the Imperial forces are regimented and uniform, wearing black and white, while the rebel strike force and their Ewok allies are associated with more naturalistic earth tones (even the rebel capital ships in the space battle above are rounder and more natural in appearance than the triangular Imperial Star Destroyers). Ultimately the Imperials are defeated, despite their superior power and technology, by the clever and resourceful Ewoks wielding only stones, arrows and log traps. This scene has often been ridiculed as implausible, but it could be seen as an expedited version of the Vietnam War, which in the end had a very similar result and would have been heavy on George Lucas' mind as he wrote it.Aside from this battle, the motifs developed throughout the series climax with the final showdown between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. The number two is an omnipresent force in this dynamic. There are two Sith, the only number of them that there can be. Palpatine wishes Luke to kill Vader and replace him, while Vader wishes his son to join him and overthrow Palpatine. Both know the other's motive and it speaks volumes about the treachery and rigid hierarchy of the Sith, that it can happen this way. Luke initially resists playing into this, but when Vader figures out that there are not one but two potential Jedi remaining (the other being Luke's sister Leia) Luke is angered and defeats Vader, severing his arm.This is as close as Luke comes to the Dark Side, for thereafter he refuses to fight. Enraged, Palpatine attempts to destroy the apprentice he cannot have. But Luke is saved by Vader, who is redeemed by the love of his son and completes his prophesied destiny of destroying the Sith (being Palpatine and himself). Luke removes Vader's mask, revealing a battered human being. Obi-Wan had described Vader as more machine now than man; twisted and evil, which may have indeed been the case. But there was some good in him, good that triumphed, if only in the very end, as Luke had believed it would.So ends the tragedy of Darth Vader. At the very end of the story, Anakin Skywalker appears to Luke as a ghost, along with Yoda and Obi-Wan. While there is some debate whether his ghost appeared as an old man or as a young one yet unsullied by the Dark Side, there is no denying the power of this ending or this story. As bad as things may often seem for our world, we as human beings always have the power to make things right, if we can find the will to do so.So ends my (over?)analysis of Star Wars. Thank you George Lucas for giving our world a great mythology to live by, one which we still need and without which there would be just a little less magic in our lives.

This scene has often been ridiculed as implausible, but it could be seen as an expedited version of the Vietnam War, which in the end had a very similar result and would have been heavy on George Lucas' mind as he wrote it.Aside from this battle, the motifs developed throughout the series climax with the final showdown between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. The number two is an omnipresent force in this dynamic. There are two Sith, the only number of them that there can be. Palpatine wishes Luke to kill Vader and replace him, while Vader wishes his son to join him and overthrow Palpatine. Both know the other's motive and it speaks volumes about the treachery and rigid hierarchy of the Sith, that it can happen this way. Luke initially resists playing into this, but when Vader figures out that there are not one but two potential Jedi remaining (the other being Luke's sister Leia) Luke is angered and defeats Vader, severing his arm.This is as close as Luke comes to the Dark Side, for thereafter he refuses to fight. Enraged, Palpatine attempts to destroy the apprentice he cannot have. But Luke is saved by Vader, who is redeemed by the love of his son and completes his prophesied destiny of destroying the Sith (being Palpatine and himself). Luke removes Vader's mask, revealing a battered human being. Obi-Wan had described Vader as more machine now than man; twisted and evil, which may have indeed been the case. But there was some good in him, good that triumphed, if only in the very end, as Luke had believed it would.So ends the tragedy of Darth Vader. At the very end of the story, Anakin Skywalker appears to Luke as a ghost, along with Yoda and Obi-Wan. While there is some debate whether his ghost appeared as an old man or as a young one yet unsullied by the Dark Side, there is no denying the power of this ending or this story. As bad as things may often seem for our world, we as human beings always have the power to make things right, if we can find the will to do so.So ends my (over?)analysis of Star Wars. Thank you George Lucas for giving our world a great mythology to live by, one which we still need and without which there would be just a little less magic in our lives.

While considered one of the weaker entries in the series overall, Episode VI has perhaps the best and most satisfying ending of the six.The motif of nature versus technology occurs most visibly in this episode.
