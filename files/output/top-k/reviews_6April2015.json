His excuse? Bodily fluids.This is the basic premise of Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove or How I Learn to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, arguably one of the most controversial and yet brilliant anti-war films of all time. It was shot in 1964, when the world was at the verge of a third World War, less than 20 years after Nazi Germany's downfall. So, how did Kubrick manage to create a film where the possibility of nuclear Holocaust is faced with laughs instead of panic? Due to a brilliant use of irony.From every character idiosyncrasy &#x96; an ex-Nazi scientist whose hand did not forget his past ideology; a patriotic American general who's so proud of his pilots he forgets their success means the end of the word; a soldier who prefers to risk the national security to vandalize a Coca-Cola vending machine; the presidents of the two enemy countries talking by phone like two 15 year-old madly in love, etc. &#x96; to every piece of dialogue like Gentlemen, you can't fight in here &#x96; this is the War Room, the movie is a giant and sarcastic critique to the hypocrisy of war and of those who think of themselves as being on the right side.On top of all that we have a historic triple performance by Peter Sellers (Dr. Strangelove, Group Captain Mandrake and the President of USA) and remarkable performances by George C. Scott and Sterling Hayden.Stanley Kubrick was a man that believed in the worse of every human being, his filmography tells us that. He knew that we tend to repeat the same mistakes over and over again. On the last scene we hear Vera Lynn singing We'll meet again. Is there a more clear warning?

Anyway, I saw it and it was amazing. By far the most underrated film in the entire Godzilla series. Godzilla is terrifying to look at, he destroys everything in his path and it's defiantly one if my favorites in the series. The Hiesi series is by far my favorite Godzilla series, and this is the film that started it all. The only problem, 22 minutes of Godzilla out of 1 hr and 45 minutes and not another monster appears in the film to fight. But a nice entry in the series. It's a shame it was never released in America, and it was followed by the horrendous Godzilla vs Biolante. Godzilla (85) is worth a watch, and I personally think it's the best movie to get people into Godzilla. He's in color, it's not as super serious as the original but it's enough to get kids and adults to see how cool the Big G really is.

","genre":"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"6 April 2015","score":"","review":" This film is designated by IMDb.com as a comedy, and it is very funny. It's also often described as a film about the importance of having a benevolent family, and it is that also. But what makes it so unusual and so emotionally powerful is its theme (from which the title is derived) A man's home is his castle. It's about the injustice of eminent domain, more prevalent in the USA than in Australia. The reasons that the Kerrigan family gives for fighting compulsory acquisition of their home mirrors what has happened for many decades in the US, most notably in the notorious 2005 Kelo case, which the Supreme Court decided 5-4 against the homeowners. Home (and business) owners who fight eminent domain are not interested in compensation; they love their homes and what those homes mean, and they don't want to move. The Castle dramatizes those values and dramatizes the fight in any nation of individuals against the premise that one's property belongs to the state and can be taken from them to serve the public good. The Castle is a hilarious, cleverly written and well-acted film that does what so few films even try to do it inspires.
