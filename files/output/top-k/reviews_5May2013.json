It has several well known actors\/actresses such as Emilio Estevez (Andrew), Judd Nelson (Bender), Ally Sheedy (Allison), Anthony Michael Hall (Brian) and Mollie Ringwald (Claire). The basics of the story is that five kids from different social circles are stuck together for Saturday detention. Through out the day they have their spats and differences, but in the end they discover they are a lot alike in many ways despite different backgrounds. They are a bunch of kids who are in that transitional point in life where they want to be treated like adults, but they still don't quite act the part.Throughout the film you see the idea of opposites attracting slowly start to take shape. By the end, the stereotypical straight- laced jock, Andrew, finds himself taken by the oddball and emotional basket case Allison. At the same time, the popular girl Claire falls for the bad boy Bender. In the mix Brian emerges with four new friends who don't fit into his normal social circle of highly intelligent nerds. Along with everything else that is going on, you have the assistant principal, Dick Vernon, who is played by Paul Gleason. He plays the roll of the typical assistant principal in that he comes off as a wannabe tough guy who isn't going to take any crap from punk school kids. Hating the idea that he has to spend his Saturday at school watching after them, he is going to go out of his way to make them as miserable as he is. A very obvious aspect of the film was costumes. You knew before the story really got started what kind of personalities the characters were going to have just by the clothes they were wearing. Ally Sheedy with her frumpish look, Emilio Estevez in his letter-man jacket and Mollie Ringwald with her designer outfit. They didn't even have to speak and you knew what kind of people they were going to be. It all added to the different people from different social circles aspect of the film. The film also captured a very good cross section of 80's popular culture in many ways. Some of those included, again, the clothing worn, hairstyles, vocabulary and the music. To this day, if someone who was born in the 90's or later wants to know what the 80's were like, I tell them to watch either the Breakfast club or a another movie that was similar in a lot of ways, Fast Times At Ridgemont High.

I ever thought I would see him do better, but then I saw Reservoir Dogs. It's true that Res-Dogs came out before Pulp Fiction but I saw Res-Dogs after I saw Pulp Fiction. It was something I don't see in many movies, and that is that the storyline is very short and not much happens but the dialog is the force behind the story. Reservoir Dogs is an interesting movie and when I saw it the first time I almost watched it again, but it was 3am and I was tired. I actually started because I loved the first scene so much.As I said, the dialog was outstanding in this movie. Tarantino knows how to write a script. Mr. White, Mr. Pink, Mr. Brown, Mr. Orange, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Blue, Joe, and Nice Guy Eddie are sitting in a restaurant in the opening scene. These men are all of the main characters and they are what the movie is built around. In the opening scene we come in mid conversation and they are talking about the meaning behind the song Like a Virgin, and it was interesting. The fact that anybody can come in mid conversation to start a movie and be entertained is impressive and isn't seen that often. Then it gets even better. Mr. Pink refuses to tip the waitress and an argument about tipping and if it's the right thing to do is funny and it fit so well. It made me rethink the idea of tipping but I still do it anyway. Finally the opening scene is ended with all the Reservoir Dogs walking in slow motion the strangest song but again, it works. That shot where they introduce credits of the actors and the title screen comes up is a classic.My favorite character is easily Mr. Pink. Steve Buscemi blew me away with his performance. He is one of the most important characters and he is makes some of the greatest impacts. The basic story behind Res-Dogs is that Joe gets a group of people together to pull off the perfect robbery, but the plan fails when they find out a cop is undercover. Mr. Pink brings up the possibility of a rat and the ball starts rolling from there. Mr. Pink is the only character with a lot of mystery surrounding him. We don't get his origin story like we did with White, Blonde, and Orange and we don't know for sure what happens to him in the end. All of the characters get endings except for Mr. Pink and that makes me angry, but I love it at the same time. I wanted more of Mr. Pink but I also love how I don't know a lot about him.The only flaw I see with Res-Dogs is the lack of chemistry between Harvey Keitel and Steve Buscemi. The movie slows down and the conversation they have isn't that believable. What I mean is, you can tell they are acting and it took me out of the experience. They are talking about the possibility of a rat and even though the ending of the scene picked up I left it wanting a little more effort. Other than that the movie is incredibly predictable. I knew the basic premise of the movie was to find out who the rat was and when I saw who the actors were I knew who it was. After the opening scene in the restaurant and the opening credits I knew who it was. I predicted the big plot twist and surprise at the end and I knew who would live and who would die. I wasn't 100% accurate, but I basically nailed the movie before I saw it. Even though I predicted it I still wanted to see it happen and the fact that I still loved it says something. I like to talk about my favorite scene in my reviews and my favorite is when Mr. Blonde goes nuts and tortures the cop. Mr. Blonde is an interesting character and his actions are disturbing but at the same time funny. He tortures a cop just because he is a cop and he doesn't care about what the cop knows. That is disturbing. However, he tortures him while the catchiest song is playing on the radio. There is a radio station that plays 70s music all day and it's mentioned a lot by other characters. The music in Res-Dogs is unlike any other movie, most Tarantino movie are, but this is different. In this scene with Mr. Blonde, the radio is playing but he goes out to his car and the music stops. It is supposed to mean the radio is out of hearing range and when he comes back in the building we can hear it again. Little things like that make this movie what it is. Overall, Reservoir Dogs is a Tarantino movie so that means it is something special. Let's go down the WillyT Checklist. Awesome character. Check. Awesome Music. Check. Interesting story. Check. Strong opening that got me hooked. Check. Res-Dogs is blueprint Tarantino and got his name out there. It didn't necessarily put him on the map but it got enough publicity and made enough of an impact to make Pulp Fiction. Tarantino does what he wants, when he wants, and thank god for his films. Reservoir Dogs proudly gets the WillyT Seal of Approval. I loved the movie, I think I liked it better than Pulp Fiction. I watched it again a week after I saw it the first time and it was just as good if not better. In fact, I might go and watch it again right now. So, for right now, WillyT OUT!

Just leaving behind everything you know and diving headfirst into a new name with new friends and new interests? Would that really erase who you were before? The story begins with several drug users in the midst of a binge. The narrator, Danny Parker (played by Val Kilmer) is also the main character.

So, after seeing the hilarity which is Freddy's Dead, I just couldn't resist giving this a record when I saw it on the TV, knowing how bad it was going to be and it didn't disappoint.It's difficult to rate a film like this because technically it should be 0\/10, but the entertainment it provided me is worth much more than that, it didn't bore me like it did some people. So I've decided to give it a 4\/10, because going over that would probably be misleading. In terms of entertainment value, I think Freddy's Dead is actually a lot better (the lines in that are just classic!) but that doesn't stop The Dream Child from being absolutely appalling! The film makes no sense at all, all of the 'logic' from the first one has gone. It just decides to turn surreal when it chooses too! Freddy's not in it as much as I hoped, but when he is he has some fantastically bad lines to feed, It's a boy! and Bon appetite, bitch.

However, that still doesn't stop them from being quite bad and quite obviously rubber. Just when you thought that the franchise couldn't sink any lower, then Freddy's Dead came along! Both of them fit into the 'so bad it's good' category. If you fancy a laugh, then stick it on.

Casablanca made Humphrey Bogart a top star in Hollywood and Ingrid Bergman a respectable actress. Claude Rains is also great in the movie and is an important character. Michael Curtiz, who I believe is one of the greatest directors of all-time, directs this the same year as Yankee Doodle Dandy. Curtiz direction was flawless and the close-ups mainly on Bergmann shown the emotions were great. The cinematography was astounding which makes the viewer seem like they're in the room. Despite the screenplay not being 100% realistic and believable, I don't think anyone cares because of how well and effective the movie is. The dialog is one of the best in cinema history which contains many famous quotes. This movie shows how important romance, friendship, and politics could be. The beginning introduces Rick (Bogart) who owns Rick's Café Américain which is a nightclub and a place for gambling located in Casablanca which is in Northern Africa.. Usually the Vichy French, Italian, and Nazi officials go there. Rick looks like a professional businessman but seems depress for a reason we do not know. Ugarte (Peter Lorre), a petty criminal, arrives in Rick's club with letters of transit obtained through the murder of two German couriers. The papers allow the person to travel freely around German-controlled Europe and to neutral Portugal, and from there to America. Ugarte plans to make his money by selling them to the highest bidder. However that does not work out according to plan and Rick ends up with the letters. Eventually Ilsa (Bergman) comes in with a man and Sam (Dooley Wilson) notices this and is not thrilled. She asks if Rick is there and Sam doesn't her to see Rick. She tells Sam to play As Time Goes By. Sam seeming like he doesn't want to plays it anyway which angers Rick.

Here is a woman who is a philosophy teacher, she's brilliant, intelligent, standing above all criticism, and this woman, after having turned 50, realizes what a cold, lonely and worst of all, unfulfilled life she lived.Another Woman uses a very clever plot device to subtly convey these feelings. Marion rents a little flat downtown to write her new book in a quiet environment, and gets distracted by the sessions of a woman at a therapist. Her first reaction is to cover the radiation system (from which the noises come) with pillows, but the temptation is too big. She ends up listening as the poor woman's plight hit some sensitive chords. Marian who never expressed any sign of weakness, who built her solid reputation on a pedestal of serenity that allowed her to spread judgments on her entourage, find the closest echoes to her hearts' most alarming torments. Then starts an unforgettable journey in Marion's life, where we discover the people of her life, and the way she affected them.Ian Holm is Ken, a snobby and stuffy doctor, whose teenage daughter, played by Martha Plimpton, developed a certain bond with Marion. Gene Hackman is Ken's friends and the only man who passionately loved Marion and felt that there was a fire burning behind that icy facade. Harris Yulin is the less-brilliant brother who had to live under her shadow, Sandy Dennis was her closest friend and still held some serious grudges against her, Sam (Philip Bosco) her true husband, after being her professor. Marion is such a secret and reserved woman, even her detailed narration are deprived from any emotionality, this is why these characters are vital to comprehend through the way they were affected by Marion, what kind of woman she was. Interestingly, Marian's empathy with the 'voice', which would reveal to be Mia Farrow, is a self-reflection on our own mental connection with Marion, it's a voyeuristic device tunneling us into the intimacy of a person, via her mind rather than any action. Ironically, it's the same effect that John Cassavetes' A Woman Under the Influence provided, but through the true- to-life improvisation and chaotic genius of Rowlands, sinking us into the darkest abysses of human soul. Rowlands strikes again but in a more restrained manner, we see the despair in her condition through her personal reactions to Mia Farrow's cries, to her friends and family's accusations. Rowlands proves again to be the greatest living actress for her ability to cut straight to your heart, no matter how explicit of implicit her torments must stay. Another Woman is made of tones of beige, and yellow, in harmony with the autumnal setting, as to convey the same melancholy than the woman who came to the last quarter of her life, and take some perspective on her accomplishments. The Bergmanian' feel is not accidental; the director of photography is Svent Nikvyst, Bergman's long-life partner. Allen has never hid his idolization of Ingmar Bergman but even if Marian's journey into her past, and the magnificent dreamy escape, are explicit homages to The Wild Strawberries, Another Woman stands alone as a masterpiece of humanity, highlighting the conflicts between feelings, reason and instinct. Basically, Marian is a woman who thought so much, she mostly about how to feel, than feeling, using an intelligence like a social double-edged swords.Woody Allen is not just a talented but also an intelligent screenwriter, the only one I can think of to write intellectual's dialogs with such naturalism, there is Bergman again but this is more of Allen's trademark. Starting with Annie Hall, Manhattan, Interiors, Hannah and Her Sisters and September, the dichotomy between belonging to an upper class elite and being condemned to a world of boring social conventions, where intelligence and sophistication are the very barriers for living the exhilarating experiences they love to discover in books or movies. That is the paradox of Allen's characters. I mentioned at the end of my September review that the film coincided with Allen's 50's, a time he wondered where he was going, if he fulfilled his own dreams? Or was it even worth it? I guess as intelligent as Woody Allen is, he's not enough to be alienated by it, he's aware that without passion, without genuine affection, without the power not to take life seriously, life would be hell. Allen's dramatic vein has nothing to envy one of the best dramatic directors, but I admire his constant restriction as he never falls in the trap of over-dramatization, and even the darkest dramas carry some thin and fragile lights of hopes. The ending of Another Woman is satisfying because we know that Marion could make her own diagnostic, being aware of the problem can be half the solution. And in one expression of the eyes, we don't need anything other than putting our own pillows and let this woman try to reconquer the lost time.Finally, allow me to play the movie geek by insisting that Another Woman is the combination of tremendous talents in acting, directing, writing and cinematography. The film is a masterpiece, it's one of Allen's best and to use one Internet's favorite jargon, it's cruelly 'underrated'.

Then starts an unforgettable journey in Marion's life, where we discover the people of her life, and the way she affected them.Ian Holm is Ken, a snobby and stuffy doctor, whose teenage daughter, played by Martha Plimpton, developed a certain bond with Marion. Gene Hackman is Ken's friends and the only man who passionately loved Marion and felt that there was a fire burning behind that icy facade. Harris Yulin is the less-brilliant brother who had to live under her shadow, Sandy Dennis was her closest friend and still held some serious grudges against her, Sam (Philip Bosco) her true husband, after being her professor. Marion is such a secret and reserved woman, even her detailed narration are deprived from any emotionality, this is why these characters are vital to comprehend through the way they were affected by Marion, what kind of woman she was. Interestingly, Marian's empathy with the 'voice', which would reveal to be Mia Farrow, is a self-reflection on our own mental connection with Marion, it's a voyeuristic device tunneling us into the intimacy of a person, via her mind rather than any action. Ironically, it's the same effect that John Cassavetes' A Woman Under the Influence provided, but through the true- to-life improvisation and chaotic genius of Rowlands, sinking us into the darkest abysses of human soul. Rowlands strikes again but in a more restrained manner, we see the despair in her condition through her personal reactions to Mia Farrow's cries, to her friends and family's accusations. Rowlands proves again to be the greatest living actress for her ability to cut straight to your heart, no matter how explicit of implicit her torments must stay. Another Woman is made of tones of beige, and yellow, in harmony with the autumnal setting, as to convey the same melancholy than the woman who came to the last quarter of her life, and take some perspective on her accomplishments. The Bergmanian' feel is not accidental; the director of photography is Svent Nikvyst, Bergman's long-life partner. Allen has never hid his idolization of Ingmar Bergman but even if Marian's journey into her past, and the magnificent dreamy escape, are explicit homages to The Wild Strawberries, Another Woman stands alone as a masterpiece of humanity, highlighting the conflicts between feelings, reason and instinct. Basically, Marian is a woman who thought so much, she mostly about how to feel, than feeling, using an intelligence like a social double-edged swords.Woody Allen is not just a talented but also an intelligent screenwriter, the only one I can think of to write intellectual's dialogs with such naturalism, there is Bergman again but this is more of Allen's trademark. Starting with Annie Hall, Manhattan, Interiors, Hannah and Her Sisters and September, the dichotomy between belonging to an upper class elite and being condemned to a world of boring social conventions, where intelligence and sophistication are the very barriers for living the exhilarating experiences they love to discover in books or movies. That is the paradox of Allen's characters. I mentioned at the end of my September review that the film coincided with Allen's 50's, a time he wondered where he was going, if he fulfilled his own dreams? Or was it even worth it? I guess as intelligent as Woody Allen is, he's not enough to be alienated by it, he's aware that without passion, without genuine affection, without the power not to take life seriously, life would be hell. Allen's dramatic vein has nothing to envy one of the best dramatic directors, but I admire his constant restriction as he never falls in the trap of over-dramatization, and even the darkest dramas carry some thin and fragile lights of hopes. The ending of Another Woman is satisfying because we know that Marion could make her own diagnostic, being aware of the problem can be half the solution. And in one expression of the eyes, we don't need anything other than putting our own pillows and let this woman try to reconquer the lost time.Finally, allow me to play the movie geek by insisting that Another Woman is the combination of tremendous talents in acting, directing, writing and cinematography.

Here is a woman who is a philosophy teacher, she's brilliant, intelligent, standing above all criticism, and this woman, after having turned 50, realizes what a cold, lonely and worst of all, unfulfilled life she lived.Another Woman uses a very clever plot device to subtly convey these feelings. Marion rents a little flat downtown to write her new book in a quiet environment, and gets distracted by the sessions of a woman at a therapist. Her first reaction is to cover the radiation system (from which the noises come) with pillows, but the temptation is too big. She ends up listening as the poor woman's plight hit some sensitive chords.

I was afraid that my English would be inadequate in order to do it justice. So it is with great humility that I will try it now...From the very first scene, I knew that this film was a masterpiece, far superior to other Billy Wilder works I had seen, and this impression grew as the film advanced.It deals with a man who is no hero, who is not involved in earth shattering events or conflicts. It is the story of Don Birnam, a man who drinks and can't stop drinking, although there is no real cause for him to be unhappy or desperate. He is handsome, cultured, intelligent, educated, loved by a beautiful and kind woman and by a devoted brother. Very much qualified to work in a decent job, and make his life very pleasant, happy even. But, he was unfortunate in having a very promising start as a writer, and when this talent proved somewhat short-lived, he could not settle for less and instead, took refuge in drinking. We follow his footsteps as he goes lower and lower, losing his dignity and his self-respect, and all the time we feel no pity for him, only anger. Anger because he throws everything good that life has to offer him, for nothing, for an illusion, for the fake reality of the bottle...The film is superbly written and directed by Billy Wilder, simplicity and lack of pompousness being the key words, designed on the basis of CINEMA VERITE, almost like a documentary, only not about a humdrum individual,but about a gifted child that goes to waste because he refuses to compromise. To say that Ray Milland is magnificent as Don Birnam, is to say very little. He has BECOME that lost man, he lives his misery, minute by minute, and he is even more heart-breaking because he never allows us to forget the quality of the man underneath the surface, which is in direct contradiction with the degrading exterior. And despite the fact that the situations in which Birnam is involved are so excessive, Milland manages admirably to maintain a good measure. He alternates the bitter humor and self sarcasm of the frustrated writer with the dramatic climax some scenes call for, and brings to life this complex and fascinating human being. Milland carries the whole film and makes the experience an unforgettable one for the viewer. One of the most deserved Academy Awards of all time! The other actors are all very good. Jane Wyman is perfect as Helen, the supportive girl friend, Doris Dowling amazing as Gloria, the bar girl in love with Don, Phillip Terry as Don's brother Wick, Howard Da Silva as Nat, the bar-tender and Frank Faylen as Bim, the male nurse. I loved everything in this film, from the atmospheric photography, to the eerie music by Miklos Rozsa, all contributed to make this a very unique film... The ending did not appear unrealistic to me, after all we know that the real Don, the novelist Charles Jackson, managed to control his drinking and write his book, and be there when it was transported to film. The film's happy ending was an.. intermediate one, and it does not exclude the possibility that later on Don might not start again this vicious circle, since we also know that Jackson finally committed suicide. No assurances for a permanent happy ending can be given, anyway. After all, even when the boy marries the girl and they live happily ever after, how can we be sure that they will still be together after some years?One final point that I MUST make, although slightly irrelevant Apart and beyond the acting, Ray Milland is so sexy in this film, it is unbelievable! Tall and very slender, he is like a horse whip, and so intense and so vulnerable at the same time, that our imagination runs wild.... Poor Gloria, how I understand you!

I was only watching modern movies at that point, mostly American, and I was unsatisfied with most of the films we were watching for the class (most of them I've come around to liking since, though they all have a bit of a stigma of being attached to that class). The one big exception was Godard's Breathless, which kind of blew me away. It just felt fresh, where so many of those other films felt dated to me. Outside of the class, when exploring a video store's foreign section, a friend and I picked up Contempt - I wanted to see more Godard and he wanted to see more Brigitte Bardot (I have no idea how he already knew about her). He got the better deal, with Bardot's beautiful bum gracing the screen for a few glorious minutes. I was unsatisfied with this follow-up to Breathless. I think I avoided Godard for a year or two afterward, but I started liking him again when I saw Band of Outsiders. I pretty much ate up all of his other films afterward, loving most of them. I had always meant to get back to Contempt, but never did. Unfortunately, several years ago, particularly after Notre Musique, I fell out of love with Godard. This second viewing of Contempt is the first Godard film I've watched or rewatched since Notre Musique (though I've bought several, including Contempt). I wonder, if I had watched it when I was in my Godard period, would I have loved it as I did so many others? Strangely enough, I felt almost exactly the same way about Contempt that I felt about it the first time it's gorgeous, but, lord, is it a bore. I can almost live on the images alone - especially all the images of Bardot. But, much like Bardot herself, Contempt comes across as gorgeous but utterly empty. None of the other performances are any good, either. Palance, whom in general I like, is particularly awful. Piccoli is a total bore, too, and I can't help feeling a man who looks so much like an ape shouldn't be with Bardot. It's interesting to see Fritz Lange as an actor, but he doesn't have much to do. Really, the only character I had any real attraction to was Giorgia Moll, who may be even prettier than Bardot. The film'd almost be better without any people in it - the scenery is plenty good. But they'd also have to remove that terrible, repetitive score to make it worth sitting through - it's easily the worst part of the whole film.

I had always meant to get back to Contempt, but never did. Unfortunately, several years ago, particularly after Notre Musique, I fell out of love with Godard. This second viewing of Contempt is the first Godard film I've watched or rewatched since Notre Musique (though I've bought several, including Contempt). I wonder, if I had watched it when I was in my Godard period, would I have loved it as I did so many others? Strangely enough, I felt almost exactly the same way about Contempt that I felt about it the first time it's gorgeous, but, lord, is it a bore. I can almost live on the images alone - especially all the images of Bardot. But, much like Bardot herself, Contempt comes across as gorgeous but utterly empty. None of the other performances are any good, either. Palance, whom in general I like, is particularly awful. Piccoli is a total bore, too, and I can't help feeling a man who looks so much like an ape shouldn't be with Bardot. It's interesting to see Fritz Lange as an actor, but he doesn't have much to do. Really, the only character I had any real attraction to was Giorgia Moll, who may be even prettier than Bardot. The film'd almost be better without any people in it - the scenery is plenty good. But they'd also have to remove that terrible, repetitive score to make it worth sitting through - it's easily the worst part of the whole film. But it's Brechtian! my film professor would say. *beep* off! I would reply.

Tobey Maquire plays the orphan, Homer Wells, who after several failed adoptions, is brought up by the doctor in charge of the orphanage, Dr. Larch, played by Michael Caine. Set in 1930's Maine, during a period where abortions are illegal, Dr. Larch raises and trains Homer to perform both child births and abortions in an endeavor to save women seeking a way out of children from being operated on by less educated and more criminal abortionists looking to make a quick dollar.Homer struggles with the decision to aid young women in performing abortions, even while Dr. Larch points out the need for their assistance, as without the aid of properly trained individuals, these women risk not only the lives of the child, but their own. Dr. Larch points out that the female should be willing to make the choice for herself while Homer is left believing it is only okay for an abortion to be performed in the case of rape or incest(Dr. Larch and Homer take opposite stances similar to those found today in pro-choice versus pro-life politics). The story becomes murkier as Homer becomes friends with the young couple of Wally, played by Paul Rudd, and Candy, played by the lovely Charlize Theron. This new found friendship leads Homer away from the orphanage for the first time in his adult life to the apple farm own by Wally's family, where he works hard and is able to relax.

After winning an Oscar for Patton, Francis Ford Coppola became notable in Hollywood. The Godfather, Francis Ford's masterpiece, places him on the map as a respectable director. The direction was great by Coppola and the adapted screenplay by Coppola and Puzo was amazing. The wedding scene in the beginning introduces the characters and shows their importance.Don Vito Correlone (Brando) is by far the most respected character in this movie. This is shown in the beginning during the wedding of his daughter when follow Sicilian?s pay their respects to him and asking for favors. Vito shows a moral life when he feels disrespected when a family friend decided to go to the police first. He also shows moral when he is against drugs because it's a crime with victims.Michael Corelone (Pacino) who is Don Vito's youngest son seems to be a nice and noble kid especially when he is treated like a war hero and seem to be a protagonist. Michael seems to not be interested to be a part of the business but later on it seems like he was force to. Towards the end of the film when Michael lies to his sister and wife and closes door on his wife it seemed like it was the beginning of a new villain within Michael.Sonny (Caan) who is Don Vito's eldest son seems to be the next Don. However, he has his flaws especially being known as short-tempered and eager. He flaws would soon affect him and the chances of becoming the next Don.The middle child which seems to be the least important one is Fredo. Fredo (Cazale) is the child that seems not to gain any respect from anyone within the family. He is also known as the weak one within the family.Tom Hagen (Duvall) who is the Don's adopted son is the right hand man for the family and he is the brains for them with all of the connections.The only daughter in the family is Connie (Shire), she is nice and tired of the mafia life and she is extremely gullible. She marries an abusive person but is gullible enough to stay with him and defend him.Kay (Keaton) who is Michael's girlfriend gets pushed around starting when Michael says he would never get involved with his families work but as we all know this isn't true. Michael's work for the family slowly tears apart his relationship with Kay. The ending of the film can easily be considered the greatest with Michael becoming the Godfather in two different ways.This movie shows the life of a Mafia man, the scary and painful times. The acting by the whole cast with the likes of Brando, Pacino, Duvall, Caan, Cazale, Keaton, and Shire was amazing and was one the best of performances by them in their careers. Brando himself put up one of the greatest performances by an actor ever. Pacino has his best performance in his career which also starts it off.

The wedding scene in the beginning introduces the characters and shows their importance.Don Vito Correlone (Brando) is by far the most respected character in this movie. This is shown in the beginning during the wedding of his daughter when follow Sicilian?s pay their respects to him and asking for favors. Vito shows a moral life when he feels disrespected when a family friend decided to go to the police first. He also shows moral when he is against drugs because it's a crime with victims.Michael Corelone (Pacino) who is Don Vito's youngest son seems to be a nice and noble kid especially when he is treated like a war hero and seem to be a protagonist. Michael seems to not be interested to be a part of the business but later on it seems like he was force to. Towards the end of the film when Michael lies to his sister and wife and closes door on his wife it seemed like it was the beginning of a new villain within Michael.Sonny (Caan) who is Don Vito's eldest son seems to be the next Don. However, he has his flaws especially being known as short-tempered and eager. He flaws would soon affect him and the chances of becoming the next Don.The middle child which seems to be the least important one is Fredo. Fredo (Cazale) is the child that seems not to gain any respect from anyone within the family. He is also known as the weak one within the family.Tom Hagen (Duvall) who is the Don's adopted son is the right hand man for the family and he is the brains for them with all of the connections.The only daughter in the family is Connie (Shire), she is nice and tired of the mafia life and she is extremely gullible. She marries an abusive person but is gullible enough to stay with him and defend him.Kay (Keaton) who is Michael's girlfriend gets pushed around starting when Michael says he would never get involved with his families work but as we all know this isn't true. Michael's work for the family slowly tears apart his relationship with Kay. The ending of the film can easily be considered the greatest with Michael becoming the Godfather in two different ways.This movie shows the life of a Mafia man, the scary and painful times. The acting by the whole cast with the likes of Brando, Pacino, Duvall, Caan, Cazale, Keaton, and Shire was amazing and was one the best of performances by them in their careers. Brando himself put up one of the greatest performances by an actor ever. Pacino has his best performance in his career which also starts it off.

Please read at your own risk.American Beauty is a movie I feel everyone should see at least once. Not only does it keep you guessing at what is going to be happening next, it also makes you feel some questionable emotions you never thought was possible from a seemingly harmless movie. The movie is centered around a man, Lester Burnham, and his family of interesting characters. His wife, Carolyn, is a Realtor who hates her life and their daughter, Jane, is also a depressed ball of teen hormones. Everything starts out looking very bleak for the family, who are so seemingly content on the outside, so they start making some changes. Not always are these changes for the best. The rest of the movie is a kaleidoscope of horrible decision making mixed with uncomfortable events that are almost too creepy to watch. Lester and Carolyn's mid-life crises are a roller-coaster of emotions and they seem to take it to another level. After an unhealthy obsession with his daughter's friend gets too out of control, things really start to get uncomfortable and you can't seem to figure out what will happen next. I really have to say that I really enjoyed this movie as a whole. Not only was the acting absolutely terrific, but the scenes are seamlessly shot, cut and edited. The lightening and music provide the perfect subtle detail to every scene. I will leave you with this If you love crazy, roller-coaster of a emotions movie, you will love this one. If you're anything like me you will probably have more questions than answers and have to view it again, just to be sure you really saw what you think you saw! However, I will admit that I love Kevin Spacey and everything he does, so I figured I'd like this movie. I would most definitely recommend American Beauty to anyone and hope that my review will be helpful for anyone curious to seeing it!

Are they privileged? Maybe from our perspective, but most of them would endure the trauma of having witnessed the death of a friend, a parent or even the seat neighbor. Most of them would endure the survivor's guilt. Not to mention the traumatic landing and the subsequent lottery of death. Peter Weir's movie, based on a novel by Rafael Iglesias, explores the complexities of the human soul from the different ways it reacts to a life-changing experience. The most intriguing case is Max Klein, an architect and family man, played by Jeff Bridges. Around him, it's chaos, mayhem, panic, cries and cadavers yet he walks like along the site, floating on a cloud of extraordinary serenity. He's not just a survivor, but also a savior, he gave a baby back to his mom, helped a little boy who was flying alone, he showed the safe way to many distraught passengers. Yet, the film doesn't focus on his heroic status, which he himself declines, it is more about the perception of life and death when you have been walking on the thin tightrope that separate the two worlds, when you 'saw the tunnel leading to a light'.Speaking of 'light', the narrative is punctuated by a few flashbacks that reveal how normally scared Max was during the flight, while sitting next to his best friend and colleague. It's only after the situation got more critical, that a mysterious heavenly light appeased his thoughts, and filled his heart with the serene confidence he would live. The crash sequence, which is among one of the most realistic, haunting and emotional from any other film, give some interesting insights that are later 'contradicted' by Max. The way he sees it he's already a ghost, God can't touch him, he shares the little secret with Carla, a Hispanic mother who lost her child and can't recover from the guilt of not having held him tightly in her arms. Max and Carla form two interesting cases. Max survived and believe he's invulnerable, 'fearless' as the title suggest, with an inexorable desire to live life to its fullest, and the consequence is that it affects its relationships with his entourage. He becomes totally estranged to his wife, played by Isabella Rosselini (whose uncanny resemblance with her legendary was almost distracting), he lost the fatherly bond with his son in favor of the one he rescued, he couldn't even find the right words for his friend's widow or cooperate with the lawyer's desperate efforts to obtain a huge indemnity. Max rejects life's normality money, convention, fear, video games, living with memories, his idea of the perfect life to live is a personal utopia that can only be fulfilled with someone who understands him. And this person is Carla. Played by Rosie Perez, Carla is the emotional core of the film, through the reaction most viewers can relate to, she's not a kind of super-human or angel, she only tried to save her son, but failed. And this failure puts her in a depressive state with suicidal impulses that only her deep Hispanic Catholic faith can alter. Contrarily to Max, Carla is much aware that she's living and that's what makes her life unbearable, for Max, the idea of death is so intolerable that he teases it by eating strawberries, a fruit he's allergic to, crossing the road, or walking on the ledge of a building's roof in the film's most emblematic scene. Fear is connected with self-preservation, but in Max' case, the fearless state doesn't mean he doesn't want to live, but it betrays his sentiment of inner immortality, yet the only way to be immortal is to be actually dead. Max is still between life and death. Either the wish to be dead out of guilt or sensation of being already dead from a weird exhilaration, both Perez and Bridges drive the film through sensitive and sensational performances. The therapist, played by John Turturro, explains to Max' wife that both Max and Carla represent two extremes in terms of reactions and on their interactions can depend chances of recovery. The relationship has a romantic vibe and maybe Max genuinely loves Carla, but Fearless never lures us into the idea that Carla would fall in love with him on the simple basis that they had the same experience. Love is not an end but a mean for Max to suppress all the traces of guilt in Carla's mind. Ironically, that's what Max' wife tries to do, helping him to regain his faith in life, and her many attempts to give a helping hand are concluded by 'failure to communicate', leading to what seems to be marital dead-end. But there is a reason Rosie Perez' performance was so acclaimed, she's not just a weepy, mourning mother, there is strength in her heart, and if her recovery can put and end to the mystical bond she had with Max, it leaves at least some room for the woman who really loves him. The conclusion of Fearless, perhaps one of the most emotionally satisfying ever, is perfect because it does three things it provides some answers about Max' enigmatic state of mind, it finds the perfect remedy, and it highlights the truth that one of the best things about life is to realize how great it is to live. Those who faced death have more awareness, and maybe this is what I consider their privilege. Do I want it? I'm not sure I'm that &#x85; fearless.

","genre":"Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"5 May 2013","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" When everyone in the 1970s was introduced to the film Shaft, it gave a great example of the African-American action hero--a cop or ex-cop who is destined to take out the bad guys. All of this inspiration from Shaft comes in A Low Down Dirty Shame. Like Shaft, Low Down has a cop or ex-cop, as well as action-packed sequences, like gunfights and fist fights, and this modernization from the former flick made A Low Down Dirty Shame make its positive impact.But there are a few twists. Keanon Ivory Wayans plays the role of Shame, who is actually an investigator who has ties to the DEA and retired as a cop. And instead of the common .38 revolver, his favorite service weapon is the 9mm Beretta. He has his sidekick, a friend named Peaches (played by Jada Pinkett at that time before she became Jada Pinkett-Smith). Shame runs his own private investigation business.So, as the story unfolds, a DEA mole named Sonny invites Shame to take on a mission to capture Ernesto Mendoza, a Mexican narcotrafficker who had a strong romance interest with character Angela Flowers, who was attempting to try to beckon Mendoza to turn himself in.The start of this focused on Shame's remembrances with Angela in the past. He mentions that she wears Covenant perfume, and basically goes on the mend to find her exactly. He does find her in one of the apartments with a bit of a police trick, and calls Sonny to try to get her to turn Mendoza in to the authorities, but regrettably, Angela said that she was on the run because a potential hit by a drug gang is imminent. This is when Sonny drops the ball but not at her...Angela was tipped, and Shame knows this. They escape the apartment as the drug gang comes in to try the death wish attempt...they confront the armed gang, and was able to escape with their lives.At Ernesto Mendoza's compound, the gang comes back home along with Sonny, and Ernesto gets upset. Sonny then rails at Ernesto that what he did will put Ernesto in trouble...and Shame was the main fly in the ointment for all of the trouble. Ernesto then does a knife slash on one of the gang members--the one who messed up the hit on Shame and Angela, and orders Sonny to get Shame.Then, Shame arms himself to the death to try to reverse the tide. He starts by forcing a low-level member of Ernesto's drug gang, Luis, to tell where Mendoza is. Little did Luis did not know that he ran into a White Supremacist rally to find that out. With that psychological torture, Luis was able to tell Shame where he was--at a nightclub. And he does. He likes to do tricks to get what he wants.Another scene I liked was the confrontation between Sonny and Angela at the shopping mall. Sonny had his gun drawn at him after Angela found the drug money. She is forced to step away and Sonny realizes that the money was real. Then, taking out of a page from the James Bond movies, Angela undresses her top, and reveals a full-figured black bra. But Sonny was smart, deciding not to take Angela's trick, but despite that, another ugly surprise..Angela then displays a gun from her back but Sonny did not even realize it...he gets hit several times as Sonny was about to use his gun to fire him back. Then a coup-de-grace shot by her finishes him off. So she killed Sonny so she can get the money.The final fight between Mendoza and Shame was something. Shame finally brings Mendoza down after a fight that resembled a dirty street fight and Muay Thai martial arts....and arrests him but the loud bang from a bullet kills Mendoza...but it was Angela who did it, not Shame. Now, she is going to kill Shame but from behind, Peaches, with her karate skills, was able to finish off Angela before Angela could kill off Shame.Then, you hear Peaches' love for soap operas as the movie is about to approach the final credits. So basically, when I flash back, Peaches loves television so much--that's the reason why she loves soap operas. ","genre":null},{"date":"5 May 2013","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" When everyone in the 1970s was introduced to the film Shaft, it gave a great example of the African-American action hero--a cop or ex-cop who is destined to take out the bad guys. All of this inspiration from Shaft comes in A Low Down Dirty Shame. Like Shaft, Low Down has a cop or ex-cop, as well as action-packed sequences, like gunfights and fist fights, and this modernization from the former flick made A Low Down Dirty Shame make its positive impact.But there are a few twists. Keanon Ivory Wayans plays the role of Shame, who is actually an investigator who has ties to the DEA and retired as a cop. And instead of the common .38 revolver, his favorite service weapon is the 9mm Beretta. He has his sidekick, a friend named Peaches (played by Jada Pinkett at that time before she became Jada Pinkett-Smith). Shame runs his own private investigation business.So, as the story unfolds, a DEA mole named Sonny invites Shame to take on a mission to capture Ernesto Mendoza, a Mexican narcotrafficker who had a strong romance interest with character Angela Flowers, who was attempting to try to beckon Mendoza to turn himself in.The start of this focused on Shame's remembrances with Angela in the past. He mentions that she wears Covenant perfume, and basically goes on the mend to find her exactly. He does find her in one of the apartments with a bit of a police trick, and calls Sonny to try to get her to turn Mendoza in to the authorities, but regrettably, Angela said that she was on the run because a potential hit by a drug gang is imminent. This is when Sonny drops the ball but not at her...Angela was tipped, and Shame knows this. They escape the apartment as the drug gang comes in to try the death wish attempt...they confront the armed gang, and was able to escape with their lives.At Ernesto Mendoza's compound, the gang comes back home along with Sonny, and Ernesto gets upset. Sonny then rails at Ernesto that what he did will put Ernesto in trouble...and Shame was the main fly in the ointment for all of the trouble. Ernesto then does a knife slash on one of the gang members--the one who messed up the hit on Shame and Angela, and orders Sonny to get Shame.Then, Shame arms himself to the death to try to reverse the tide. He starts by forcing a low-level member of Ernesto's drug gang, Luis, to tell where Mendoza is. Little did Luis did not know that he ran into a White Supremacist rally to find that out. With that psychological torture, Luis was able to tell Shame where he was--at a nightclub. And he does. He likes to do tricks to get what he wants.Another scene I liked was the confrontation between Sonny and Angela at the shopping mall. Sonny had his gun drawn at him after Angela found the drug money. She is forced to step away and Sonny realizes that the money was real. Then, taking out of a page from the James Bond movies, Angela undresses her top, and reveals a full-figured black bra. But Sonny was smart, deciding not to take Angela's trick, but despite that, another ugly surprise..Angela then displays a gun from her back but Sonny did not even realize it...he gets hit several times as Sonny was about to use his gun to fire him back. Then a coup-de-grace shot by her finishes him off. So she killed Sonny so she can get the money.The final fight between Mendoza and Shame was something. Shame finally brings Mendoza down after a fight that resembled a dirty street fight and Muay Thai martial arts....and arrests him but the loud bang from a bullet kills Mendoza...but it was Angela who did it, not Shame. Now, she is going to kill Shame but from behind, Peaches, with her karate skills, was able to finish off Angela before Angela could kill off Shame.Then, you hear Peaches' love for soap operas as the movie is about to approach the final credits.
