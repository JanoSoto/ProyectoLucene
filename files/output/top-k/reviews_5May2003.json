Shalhoub and his two kids are in financial troube, but their problems seem to be solved when Shalhoub's late uncle (F.

Unlukcy enough for Shalhoub and his family, the entire place locks up and it turns out twelve ghosts inhabit the place and are looking to cause some death and destruction.Thirteen Ghosts is mess, thanks to Steve Beck's hyperkinetic direction. In true MTV-style, Beck flashes several frames per second, making this an assault on the senses that's even more unbearable than Stigmata. I don't understand, does Beck actually believe these quick cuts will generate scares? Does he believe he's made a truly frightening film because of this style?

I've come to expect such silliness from these films, but certainly, the trashiness factor didn't hurt House on Haunted Hill because it was enjoyable from beginning to end (and really, it was good trash).

It is the story of a man who exceeds past all normal expectations and makes the most out of what he is doing. What is he doing? Boxing. Why? As Rocky says in the film, You have to be a moron to want to box.Rocky is played by Sylvester Stallone, whose only other film before Rocky was Weekend at Kitty and Stud's, and, as you can probably guess by the title, it was an X-rated movie. But Stallone gives just about the best performance of his career here. Before he started getting into recycled action movies and unfunny comedies, the man had talent, as seen shining through in Rocky. Somewhere along the way he lost that talent, but it's pretty evident that he had it at one time.Stallone wrote the script, which is about a down-on-his-luck Philadelphia man named Rocky Balboa. Rocky is your average tough-guy you see walking down the street, but this film takes a closer look INTO the guy walking past you, and not AT the guy walking past you.He lives in a beat-up, old apartment, infested with roaches, and he barely makes enough money to support himself. His job? Rocky retrieves money for loan sharks. His real job, however, is to break the loaners' thumbs if they don't pay up. He's a muscle man.After he returns from his job every day, he takes time to do what he has been doing for the past six years, which is boxing. Then, after that, he takes a trip to the local pet store to see the love of his life, Adrian, who works there. He constantly tries to impress her and talk to her, but she is shy and literally does not talk much throughout the entire film.But things change for Rocky after heavyweight champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) decides that he wants to make a big performance on the 4th of July. He wants to appear nice by letting a regular Joe Schmoe fight him in the ring. All for show, of course. As he is looking through a book of local boxers, he points his finger at the letters THE Italian STALLION, a.k.a. Rocky. He says that fighting an Italian is perfect. An Italian found America, Creed says. If he fights an Italian-American on the 4th of July, it will be symbolic and will also make Creed look good.But Rocky doesn't realize this is all for show. When he receives word that Apollo Creed wishes to fight him in the ring, Rocky begins to train long and hard with Burgess Meredith, which results in the famous scene where Rocky runs up an entry of stairs in Philly with the music Gonna Fly Now playing in the background. This scene is spoofed by films world-wide, and it's one of the cornerstones in film history. You will see it all the time. It's just one of those film moments that are marked down in history.The most entertaining thing about Rocky is how innocent Sylvester Stallone comes across in his role as Rocky. You feel for him when he is trying to impress Adrian and she shrugs him off. The scene where her brother invites Rocky over, and Rocky keeps saying, Are you sure she knows I'm coming? is a sign of how the guy has been put down. And then when she comes over to his apartment, he acts nice and talks to her. He's not trying any moves on her. He just enjoys being with her. Rocky is a bit of an idiot, as he himself admits, but he's a sweet idiot.And the end, when Rocky fights Apollo Creed, is amazing. A nobody who actually stands a chance against the heavyweight champion of the world. Creed and Rocky are being battered by each other. Creed goes into the opposite corner as Rocky, and one of Creed's managers says, This guy thinks this thing is for real -- knock him out! You feel sorry for Rocky there, because he is giving the fight all he's got, when it was just a publicity stunt from the beginning, but he didn't even realize it.Things like that are what make Rocky what it has become over the years. It is a great film, and it has many classic moments that you will see spoofed in films all the time. You should probably see it just for that fact.But the truth is, if you take away all the underlying intricacies, Rocky is just the story of a simple guy who gets a chance to do something amazing, and he gives it all he's got.

Every month, I'd dash to the comic book store, eager to purchase the newest issues (the X-men had two running series) of this clashing team of mutants.  Like everyone else, I had my favorite characters; Wolverine, for his interesting anti-hero but honorable qualities, and Psylocke, who simply oozed sex appeal, intelligence, and could alternately kick any guy's ass in hand-to-hand combat.  What more could you want from a lady?But I wasn't completely sold on the movie when I first heard of it, particularly with unknown Hugh Jackman in the lead. So it was with cautionary anticipation I approached this film.  Hell, I was so cautious I didn't even see it until it came out on DVD, but in the end, this was an enjoyable hour-and-a-half diversion, and probably the best comic book to film adaptation since Tim Burton's Batman.As expected, X-Men spends a large portion of its running time as a set-up, for both its characters and future plotlines.  But for those curious, Patrick Stewart stars as Professor Charles Xavier, virtually the world's most powerful mutant with the ability to read and control minds.  He heads a school to teach other mutants to develop their powers, the heads of the classes being Cyclops (James Marsden), Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), and Storm (Halle Berry).  Two newcomers arrive after an attack in the woods, Logan AKA Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Rogue (Anna Paquin).  Their enemy is Magneto, a powerful mutant who wishes to make the world a place safe for mutants, even if it means the destruction of the human race.Almost all comic book adaptations are action\/adventures, and while X-men certainly qualifies as such, many might be surprised that the movie spends more time developing its characters than placing them in dangerous situations.  I was pleasantly surprised, and given that these characters were interesting, the pacing never flagged and the build-up to the action-packed finale kept the film moving with surging momentum.In a movie like this, the cast is probably the most important aspect of the production, and the two most important characters to cast were Professor Xavier and Wolverine.  Screw up casting these two roles and the whole movie might have been in jeopardy.  But thankfully, the producers didn't screw up, and these two parts were casted perfectly.  Patrick Stewart makes for an honorable and gentle Xavier, exactly the way everyone imagined he would be (it's not as if though casting Stewart was ever question of if, but when, he actually looks like Xavier).  Hugh Jackman is the real find, totally cool and badass as Wolverine, but also with a down-to-earth quality that makes him so appealing.  I think we're all glad production on MI-2 ran overlong, or else we'd have seen Dougray Scott in this part.Though I did mention the film spent most of its time developing the characters, the fact the cast is so large leaves a lot of them adrift, most particularly James Marsden as Cyclops and Halle Berry as Storm.  Janssen is a passable Jean Grey, though she seems a bit too old for the part.  Anna Paquin, however, is very good as Rogue, a teen who finds herself coming to terms with her powers.  She and Logan have this daughter\/father relationship going, which means she also has the double role of the character Jubilee, who's actually nowhere to be seen (which might be a good thing, I recall she was incredibly annoying in the comics).The villains don't fare as well, each of them barely given any dialogue except for Magneto.  As the master of the metal, Ian Mckellen is fine, but looks hilariously silly in that costume and helmet of his.  Tyler Mane has the physique for the part of Sabretooth, that's about it.  Ray Park has the role of Toad, who's a bit different from how I remember him in the comics (didn't he secrete gunk from his hands?), but it's only slightly less lame. Rebecca Romjin-Stamos is in blue make-up for all her screen-time as the shape-shifting Mystique.The action sequences are exciting without ever being truly memorable.  In fact, some of the fight scenes could have been staged and filmed a bit better, but it's understandable why filming such fights would have been difficult, considering these mutants battle with a variety of powers.  The wirework during the Wolverine\/Sabretooth battle is...lacking, maybe a little too Matrix-ish for my tastes.The only real problem I have (and it's a biggie) with X-Men is how unbelievably short it is.  Most comic book adaptations focus on one character and run for over two hours.  This one's got over a dozen, and it's barely an hour-and-a-half (sans credits) long!  Too much feels left out, too much is left unfinished, but I guess that's why we have sequels.

But for those curious, Patrick Stewart stars as Professor Charles Xavier, virtually the world's most powerful mutant with the ability to read and control minds.  He heads a school to teach other mutants to develop their powers, the heads of the classes being Cyclops (James Marsden), Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), and Storm (Halle Berry).  Two newcomers arrive after an attack in the woods, Logan AKA Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Rogue (Anna Paquin).  Their enemy is Magneto, a powerful mutant who wishes to make the world a place safe for mutants, even if it means the destruction of the human race.Almost all comic book adaptations are action\/adventures, and while X-men certainly qualifies as such, many might be surprised that the movie spends more time developing its characters than placing them in dangerous situations.  I was pleasantly surprised, and given that these characters were interesting, the pacing never flagged and the build-up to the action-packed finale kept the film moving with surging momentum.In a movie like this, the cast is probably the most important aspect of the production, and the two most important characters to cast were Professor Xavier and Wolverine.  Screw up casting these two roles and the whole movie might have been in jeopardy.  But thankfully, the producers didn't screw up, and these two parts were casted perfectly.  Patrick Stewart makes for an honorable and gentle Xavier, exactly the way everyone imagined he would be (it's not as if though casting Stewart was ever question of if, but when, he actually looks like Xavier).  Hugh Jackman is the real find, totally cool and badass as Wolverine, but also with a down-to-earth quality that makes him so appealing.  I think we're all glad production on MI-2 ran overlong, or else we'd have seen Dougray Scott in this part.Though I did mention the film spent most of its time developing the characters, the fact the cast is so large leaves a lot of them adrift, most particularly James Marsden as Cyclops and Halle Berry as Storm.  Janssen is a passable Jean Grey, though she seems a bit too old for the part.  Anna Paquin, however, is very good as Rogue, a teen who finds herself coming to terms with her powers.  She and Logan have this daughter\/father relationship going, which means she also has the double role of the character Jubilee, who's actually nowhere to be seen (which might be a good thing, I recall she was incredibly annoying in the comics).The villains don't fare as well, each of them barely given any dialogue except for Magneto.  As the master of the metal, Ian Mckellen is fine, but looks hilariously silly in that costume and helmet of his.  Tyler Mane has the physique for the part of Sabretooth, that's about it.  Ray Park has the role of Toad, who's a bit different from how I remember him in the comics (didn't he secrete gunk from his hands?), but it's only slightly less lame. Rebecca Romjin-Stamos is in blue make-up for all her screen-time as the shape-shifting Mystique.The action sequences are exciting without ever being truly memorable.  In fact, some of the fight scenes could have been staged and filmed a bit better, but it's understandable why filming such fights would have been difficult, considering these mutants battle with a variety of powers.  The wirework during the Wolverine\/Sabretooth battle is...lacking, maybe a little too Matrix-ish for my tastes.The only real problem I have (and it's a biggie) with X-Men is how unbelievably short it is.  Most comic book adaptations focus on one character and run for over two hours.  This one's got over a dozen, and it's barely an hour-and-a-half (sans credits) long!  Too much feels left out, too much is left unfinished, but I guess that's why we have sequels.

On the surface, this film seems very simplistic. Two showgals from Arkansas try to make it big and find the love of their lives, but there is so much more going on beneath the surface. I haven't seen a lot of Marilyn's films, aside from the likes of Some Like It Hot, but here she gives a great performance as a sexy starlett who happens to be a golddigger, but is still quite smart in terms of knowing what she wants and getting it! We sympathize with her character every step of the way, and cheer for her in the end. Similarly, Monroe is well-balanced by Jane Russell. I was delighted to find out through the IMDB that she is still alive! I thought she had passed away a few years back (sorry, Jane- if you see this!). She is as gorgeous and sexy as Monroe and really carries the film well. Of course, everyone has seen Madonna's Material Girl video which is a direct rip-off of a number in this film, but nothing matches the original! Hawks' top-notch direction are once again in form. This movie could have easily been another silly musical, but Hawks made sure the movie carried itself even no one was singing and dancing. There are a number of hokey scenes in the film however, include Jane Russell dancing around an Olympic men's swim team, but in the end the movie is quite remarkable and it is better than many more famous musical films, like My Fair Lady and Hello Dolly! This movie is also proof that a straight man like me can enjoy musicals!

The film is, after all, ludicrously plotted, but that actually adds to the unique charms this movie has, which actually entertains for all the right reasons. Lifeforce is exciting, thrilling, suspenseful, and always a lot of fun, thanks to the intriguing story, the first-rate special effects, the competent action sequences, and of course, the gorgeous Mathilda May wandering around in the buff.A joint British\/American crew aboard the shuttle Churchill are studying Halley's Comet when they discover a giant contraption hidden within the coma's comet. Knowing this will be their only chance to board this enigma, they suit up and enter this contraption. Inside, they discover thousands of frozen, giant bat-like creatures, and just as interesting, three humanoids (one female, the other two male) encased in crystal-like containers. They decide to take the humanoids and one bat back to the ship with them.Thirty days go by and London has lost complete contact with the crew. So another shuttle is sent, and they discover the dessicated remains of the Churchill crew, but all three humanoids are still intact. Bringing them back to London for examination, the female one awakens, displaying the ability to drain the lifeforce out of a human being, and escapes out of the compound. Enter Steve Railsback and Peter Firth, who star, respectively, as the sole survivor of the Churchill and an agent out to stop this space vampiress from taking over the planet.If you've read the plot summary above and find this story interesting, then Lifeforce is most certainly the film for you. The first hour is probably the most engrossing, plot-wise. When you discover that whoever the vampiress kills will also rise to drain someone else's lifeforce, that's when the stakes grow much higher, as an epidemic becomes a possibility.The first half of the film resembles Species quite a bit, since you've got a team that's searching for a nubile alien that's on the loose (though, without a doubt, Ms. May is so much hotter than Natasha Henstridge). This same part of the plot adds another interesting aspect that makes the team's job more difficult; the vampiress has the ability to enter another person's body. Thus, they're no longer searching for a young, dark-haired beauty. She could be in anyone, which further raises the stakes.The engrossing story-telling sort of gives away to loads of special effects and action, but I found it a good transition. The effects are often terrific and the action is really quite exciting, surprising considering that director Tobe Hooper is usually incompetent at creating thrills and suspense. Judging from the all-out chaos that occurs in the last half-hour (burning buildings, thousands of zombie-like creatures stumbling around searching for nourishment), I'd say the film had a pretty big budget to work with (I've heard figures as high as 28M, which would be higher than Aliens' 18M a year later).Acting's probably what you would expect, with Peter Firth delivering a pretty good performance as Agent Caine. I like the guy's straightforward, calm attitude toward the situation and how he handles it. Steve Railsback as his partner who's being seduced by the vampiress in his dreams is much less impressive, sweating and overacting to amusing extents, but never coming across as very convincing. Patrick Stewart of Star Trek fame is here, too, in a role that he's probably a bit embarrassed by these days.But the most impressive of the cast is none other than Mathilda May. Watching May stand around calmly as she seduces a victim is an interesting transition from titillation to all-out horror. She's actually frightening, and that's impressive for a nude woman. Speaking of nudity, most people must have noticed that's often the most mentioned aspect of the film. Indeed, Mathilda May is one of the most gorgeous women I've ever seen. It's really perfect casting when you think about it. There's something exotic and alien about her looks (maybe the fact she's a foreigner helps) that adds a brilliant touch, and her perfect body helps, too, of course. Because of that exotic, alien look, I can't see any other drop-dead gorgeous actress who could pull this off quite as well (and this includes superhotties like Chasey Lain, Carmella DeCesare, and Tracy Ryan).Henry Mancini's score is a pretty enjoyable listen, though hardly as good as so many have claimed it to be. Even at 116 minutes, Lifeforce actually feels rushed. Some material could have explored a little further, but that's not too big a complaint. This is one wildly entertaining film I highly recommend.

The film is, after all, ludicrously plotted, but that actually adds to the unique charms this movie has, which actually entertains for all the right reasons. Lifeforce is exciting, thrilling, suspenseful, and always a lot of fun, thanks to the intriguing story, the first-rate special effects, the competent action sequences, and of course, the gorgeous Mathilda May wandering around in the buff.A joint British\/American crew aboard the shuttle Churchill are studying Halley's Comet when they discover a giant contraption hidden within the coma's comet. Knowing this will be their only chance to board this enigma, they suit up and enter this contraption. Inside, they discover thousands of frozen, giant bat-like creatures, and just as interesting, three humanoids (one female, the other two male) encased in crystal-like containers. They decide to take the humanoids and one bat back to the ship with them.Thirty days go by and London has lost complete contact with the crew. So another shuttle is sent, and they discover the dessicated remains of the Churchill crew, but all three humanoids are still intact. Bringing them back to London for examination, the female one awakens, displaying the ability to drain the lifeforce out of a human being, and escapes out of the compound. Enter Steve Railsback and Peter Firth, who star, respectively, as the sole survivor of the Churchill and an agent out to stop this space vampiress from taking over the planet.If you've read the plot summary above and find this story interesting, then Lifeforce is most certainly the film for you. The first hour is probably the most engrossing, plot-wise. When you discover that whoever the vampiress kills will also rise to drain someone else's lifeforce, that's when the stakes grow much higher, as an epidemic becomes a possibility.The first half of the film resembles Species quite a bit, since you've got a team that's searching for a nubile alien that's on the loose (though, without a doubt, Ms. May is so much hotter than Natasha Henstridge). This same part of the plot adds another interesting aspect that makes the team's job more difficult; the vampiress has the ability to enter another person's body. Thus, they're no longer searching for a young, dark-haired beauty. She could be in anyone, which further raises the stakes.The engrossing story-telling sort of gives away to loads of special effects and action, but I found it a good transition. The effects are often terrific and the action is really quite exciting, surprising considering that director Tobe Hooper is usually incompetent at creating thrills and suspense.

Until I waste my time watching what amounts to a poor excuse of putting a number of idiots with the combine IQ of a turnip on some boat heading down the Amazon River not knowing where they are going and trusting some character (John Voight, who should have known better) who comes from the mist.  Did anyone bother to ask how he got there?  Or how the lethal bee got into Eric Stoltz's character's diving gear?  And the list goes on...But that aside, I have not seen acting this bad since a couple of friends and I sat down one Saturday night to muddle through Battlefield Earth.  And it is true - Jennifer Lopez cannot act - much of what she did, or at least attempted to do, was strained at best.  And since when is it written that successful rappers actually make talented and successful actors and actresses?  Ice Cube's facial expression and voice modulation did not change through most of the movie.  I suppose that it would have been more interesting if he had broken out into song just to get the storyline moving.  To me, the sign of a bad movie is when you, as the viewer, start cheering for the bad guy to win.  A good example of this is the Phantom Menace - I was so hoping that Darth Maul would exterminate them all!  In this movie, I was hoping the snake would end it all, but in the end, the entire premise sank.  Avoid this movie...

Both are fine for their first half, with plenty of pace and action and even a few scares. But both book and film peter off in their second half, as the chase scenario which dominates the opening segment becomes a slow, tedious and frequently unconvincing cat-and-mouse affair set in a secret scientific centre known as The Shop.David Keith is a strange choice for Andy McGee, a father with mysterious powers (courtesy of an experiment gone wrong) whose daughter Charlie has even greater powers which enable her to set objects alight at will. The Shop want her so that they can kill her, as they have reason to believe she has no true control over her powers and may one day inadvertently nuke the planet Earth. As Charlie, Drew Barrymore is reasonably good, especially in the scenes where she gets mad and starts off a blaze. Best performance of the lot comes from George C. Scott, as a seemingly educated assassin who occasionally says something which hints that he well and truly out of his mind. It's a calculated and chilling display. Less worthy are the roles of Freddie Jones (bizarre and exaggerated) and Martin Sheen (bland and boring).I would say that Firestarter is worth catching if you're a fan of King or Barrymore, and although I shouldn't say this I'm sure pyromaniacs will revel in it. However, for the discerning audience there's little here worth making a special effort to see. It just comes and goes like the wind and, for want of a better word, doesn't really ignite.

Whatever you might say about him, there are moments in all his films (even Clockwork Orange, which I detest) that are magical and moving.Here there is not a scene, prop or location that doesn't ring true to the period; although maybe a bit over-the-top picture postcard at times.Many indoor scenes seem designed to make the world almost in to a moving painting, in fact there are times when we linger (for a few seconds) in stillness before dialogue\/action starts to further the effect.Some say Ryan O'Neil was too modern for the central role, but I disagree, his acting is far from Oscar material but it gets us through the movie with minimal fuss. While BL is clearly not a man of honour, a lot of the time he is merely doing what he needs to do to get by and I found him hard to dislike - even through he is a child beater!Often he is given no real lines, but emotes on the tragedy and his traps with looks, anxious glances and glazed expressions. Female lead Marissa Berenson (although hardly in the picture on the old stopwatch) seems chosen for her dazzling profile - which we linger on slowly and lovingly, by order of films joint producer and director. We don't know her or understand her though - and that is the film's one major fault.BL is the kind of film that you are going to have to get yourself prepared for mentally and in terms of sitting comfort. There are real moments of mastery here (the duelling scenes - with the rules being explained slowly and clearly - are the work of someone who understands tension and timing perfectly), but while I salute it for its technical expertise and loving care, it does leave you with the feeling that you have spent three hours in an art gallery as opposed to watching a film.

Paul 'RoboCop' Verhoeven takes on The Invisible Man! This should have been a killer movie! Verhoeven made a string of brilliant movies back in the 1980s ('Spetters', 'The Fourth Man', 'Flesh & Blood', 'RoboCop'), and after losing his way slightly since working in Hollywood, his 'Starship Troopers' was a bit of a return to form, and things were really looking good. Now I don't know what happened, but 'Hollow Man' ended up being a major let down. The cast was good - Kevin Bacon, Elizabeth Shue, the underrated cutie Kim Dickens ('Zero Effect', 'Truth Or Consequences, NM'), even William Devane, an old favourite of mine (check out 'Rolling Thunder' sometime!) - the special effects were generally pretty impressive (scientifically illogical, but who cares), but the script! By the guy who gave us 'End Of Days', one of the dumbest of all dumb movies in recent years. The script stinks! Bacon tries his hardest, but compared to Claude Rains back in the 1930s, who derailed trains(!) and planned to rule the world, his Invisible Man is just a third rate heavy. Verhoeven in the past has really pushed the boundaries with sex, violence and black humour, so I really expected a LOT more from this, but it's difficult not to regard it as a lame sell out. And the silly climax, which is drawn out WAY too much, becomes totally ludicrous when Bacon's Invisible Man somehow starts looking like The Indestructable Man! It's so stupid that any drop of good feeling you had about what preceded it goes straight down the drain. This is a crappy movie made by a guy who used to be BRILLIANT! What went wrong I don't know, but along with Tim Burton's 'Planet Of The Apes' it's difficult to think of a more disappointing movie released this decade. 'Hollow Man' is a hollow movie, and to be avoided.
