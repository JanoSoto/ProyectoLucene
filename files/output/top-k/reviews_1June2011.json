I was not bored by the film but at the same time I wasn't utterly amazed by it either. The special effects by Stan Winston and the computer graphics team were superb from top to bottom. From the tiny Compsognathus to the giant Brachiosaurus, the dinosaurs looked great, and I was so happy to finally see flying dinosaurs in action. The look of the jungle was something I liked along with the decent performances. I heard they began filming before the script was complete which meant the plot was a bit of a mess. For me a movie that holds these contents cannot sustain great entertainment for a long period of time so I appreciated the shortness of the film. I liked it slightly better than the lost world but didn't come close to the greatest dinosaur film ever made Jurassic park one. If you're looking for a ninety minute B movie with dinosaurs chasing people and occasionally eating them with no moments of wonder, the film works. If you want awe, see the original. My very favourite moment in the film was the brutally fierce duel between Mr Spino and the T-Rex. One more thing I would like to add- the title, was that the best they could do?

The movie wasn't just popular because of the quality of the movie, but especially because it was a film that was different from all the other films. Memento is film that is based on a character called Leonard Shelby (which is played by Guy Pearce), who used to earn his money as a detective for an insurance company. He can't do this anymore since he got a strange form of amnesia when his wife was murdered. He remembers everything from before the murder of his wife, but now he can't remember everything longer than 15 minutes. Every 15 minutes he wakes up again, without knowing where he is and why. He does know about his own condition and so he tries to deal with it. Because of his condition he isn't really able to find the murderer of his wife, but he still tries. To help him in this quest he has tattoos all over his body, which contain hints and clues.The thing that makes 'Memento' so special is the structure of the movie. Nolan tells the story backwards in which he starts with Leonard dealing with the murderer of his wife (Joe Pantoliana). Then the story is flashed back to the beginning. This is done in segments of about ten minutes. In between these segments, there are also the black-and-white sequences in which Leonard is seen in his motel room having a conversation, with god-knows-who, and telling a story about the past when he still worked for the insurance company. These sequences are chronological.The most thrilling thing about this movie is the fact that you don't have a clue of what is going on until the movie is finished. This gives the viewer a lot of suspense and tension while watching and also makes it more ambiguous than watching an ordinary thriller. If you aren't a patient person and you don't like to pay a lot of attention while watching a movie this is not the right movie for you. The fact that Leonard had a form of amnesia makes him forget everything he has done. Each scene starts with the last part of the previous scene so you see some parts of the movie double. The fact that this is repeated is crucial though because it helps you understand the movie a lot better. This movie is very interesting and well put together. The order of the movie is very confusing but it interacts with the audience a lot. The viewers really need to ''puzzle'' all the scenes of the movie to form a coherent storyline. We thought the movie was very confusing at first but when the movie ended everything fell into place. After the movie is done you will be still confused for what happened earlier but also surprised. Guy Pierce did a wonderful acting job and you will be dragged into the movie as soon as he starts his story. The plot is very simple but the fact that the chronological order very different compared to other movies makes the movie that challenging. We came to the conclusion this movie is not made for people who just want to have relaxing evening and watch a movie without really paying attention. This movie will confuse you and make you an investigator. We did find this amusing and very interesting to watch but we would understand why people wouldn't like this movie. People who enjoy challenging movies should definitely watch memento. This movie was well developed, had some wonderful performances, a clever structure and is very original.

I found this movie quite hard to watch at times, cine not always an awful lot good or interesting was happening and I just never really could get into this movie.It isn't always the best told movie and with its style and pace the movie even comes across as a bit clumsy at times. This is a problem I often have with early John Huston movies. I'm pretty sure of it that the movie would had been a much better one had it been made later during Huston's career, when he had some more experience as a director and storyteller. I also think this is a sort of movie that would had worked out way better had it been done in color. It would had made the adventurous and entertaining aspect of the movie come across much stronger. It now instead is more of a dark movie, almost film-noir style like. Perhaps John Huston was practicing for his next movie Key Largo, which also got released in the same year as this movie. I absolutely love basically all of Huston's film-noir but problem with him seemed that he tried to do everything as a film-noir, even when the movie was in a totally different genre.But no, of course this movie remains far from an horrible movie. It still has a very fine concept in it, as well as a story that in itself has plenty of layers to it. You can watch and interpret this movie in many different ways, which perhaps also makes multiple viewings essential.It above all things mostly also remains a real characters movie, in which the three main characters are the essentials. Their dynamic together is also great and is what mostly keeps this movie going. They are three totally different characters, which is the foremost reason why they work out so great together on film. Humphrey Bogart, Tim Holt and John Huston's own father Walter Huston play these roles. Both father and son also won an Oscar(s) for their contribution to this movie.

He has an imaginative friend, Frank. Frank tells him the World will be coming to an end. Frank makes Donnie do extreme things, from flooding the school, to destroying people lives so that Donnie will sacrifice him self and let himself get killed by the airplane motor. This will so called save all the people around him. You can tell by the story that light is going to play a key role in the movie. It is a dark, almost sad movie. Donnie Darko is a perfect example of how light can and should be used in movies. Light plays a great part in the movie and it is clearly visible and really well done, considering the low budget they had to work with.One of the most clearly visible techniques of using light in the movie is when Donnie is looking in the mirror at himself or at the bunny. They used three point lighting in theses scenes. In these scenes the three point lighting is used to illuminate the bottom half of his face from the bottom. It is almost as if someone is standing with a torch underneath which people do when they are telling a spooky story. They illuminate the bottom half of his face so that his eyes are not very visible. This makes him look a bit creepy, dark and a bit mysterious. They also positioned the lights in such a way so that the door behind him is illuminated. This makes the shadows on Donnie's face even more visible because it is seen against a lighter background making Donnie seem even more dark and creepy. Another thing that the makers did was illuminate the rabbit's face in the reflection of the mirror, especially his eyes. This had a really big effect in the movie. Every time the angle of the camera is switched ,the rabbit would all of a sudden appear in the reflection in the mirror. This can be frightening the first couple of times, because you do not expect it and the rabbit is brighter and more visible than expected. You do not expect this while watching the movie, because it is a very mysterious movie and Donnie is a very closed person so you do not expect to all of a sudden see the whole face in such detail. This is even more so in the scene set in the cinema since the rabbit is completely glowing and the eyes are shining.So light does play a big role in the movie Donnie Darko and it would not be the same good movie if the light-effects wouldn't have been used so well. It creates an atmosphere and makes you focus on the important details in the movie such as the rabbit head. The effect of the light can make you feel unconformable or curious during the movie so that you are always on the edge of your seat not expecting or knowing but wanting to know what is going to happen next. This is probably the reason why Donnie Darko was such a big success.We personally thought Donnie Darko was a very grabbing and interesting movie. The psychological problems and odd actions of Donnie kept us in a trance till the end of the movie. There were some shocking moments in the movie that made it a very exciting, and sometimes even scary movie. The acting was done so incredibly well, that however unrealistic the movie seemed, it still felt like it could happen to us any moment. Another outstanding element of the movie was that it was really difficult to understand, especially for us 16-year old students. All the odd things that happen made it difficult to follow and keep up. It wasn't until we looked it up on Internet, that we knew what it was all about. In our opinion, this is a very clever technique the writer uses, but a little bit too difficult, mainly for us younger people. Although the movie was a low-budget movie, because it was Kelly's first movie. It was extremely well filmed making good use of outside areas and common sub-urban areas, so that there was not a lot of need of big film sets, again making it feel more realistic. Also the cast existed of actors that had just started their career, however, and I cant express this enough, the acting was brilliantly done. All with all, the movie had a great impact on us, and we will remember it for a long time, and we will never forget, that not everything is what it seems to be.

All the odd things that happen made it difficult to follow and keep up. It wasn't until we looked it up on Internet, that we knew what it was all about. In our opinion, this is a very clever technique the writer uses, but a little bit too difficult, mainly for us younger people. Although the movie was a low-budget movie, because it was Kelly's first movie. It was extremely well filmed making good use of outside areas and common sub-urban areas, so that there was not a lot of need of big film sets, again making it feel more realistic. Also the cast existed of actors that had just started their career, however, and I cant express this enough, the acting was brilliantly done. All with all, the movie had a great impact on us, and we will remember it for a long time, and we will never forget, that not everything is what it seems to be.

This gives a lot of expectations about what The Exorcist should be. Especially for someone born after the film. We love The Exorcist, we have seen a lot of horror films but we consider The Exorcist as the best horror film. I first heard about an exorcist on TV, I became curious about what it was and looked on the internet. While I was searching on the internet I found out that there was a movie about it, The Exorcist. I bought the movie, watched it and learned more about an exorcist. The Exorcist starts with a group of people searching for artifacts in Iraq, the archaeologist father Merrin finds a small stone resembling a strange grimacing, bestial creature. Some strange events happen and Merrin thinks he has brought something evil in the world. Far away, in Georgetown Chris Macneil (an actress) hears strange noises in her house and strange things happen with her daughter (Regan). She changes from a nice and cute girl into a girl whom hates everyone and curses all day long. One time on a party she pees, in front of some people, on the ground. Chris goes to the doctor but they can't find what is wrong. Meanwhile, Father Damien Karras a young priest at Georgetown University doubts his religion when his mother dies from a terminal illness. Chris Macneil thinks her daughter is possessed by the devil. When all medical explanations are exhausted, a doctor recommends an exorcism, suggesting that if Regan's symptoms are a psychosomatic result of a belief in demonic possession, then perhaps an exorcism would have the effect of ending them. In desperation, Chris consults Karras, since he is both a priest and a psychiatrist. During a period in which Karras observes Regan, she constantly refers to herself as the devil. Karras initially believes her to be merely suffering from psychosis, until he records her speaking in a strange language which turns out to be English spoken backwards. Despite his doubts, Karras decides to request permission from the Church to conduct an exorcism. The same father Merrin who found the strange creature is an experienced exorcist, he comes to Georgetown and together with father Karras they conduct an exorcism. The spirit taunts and threatens the two priests both verbally and physically (he uses the voice of Karras his mother to frighten him). Father Merrin eventually gets a heart attack and dies, father Karras succeeds in driving out the spirit from Regan's body. He absorbs the spirit himself and throws himself out of the window, he dies and the spirit leaves. Chris leaves Georgetown with her daughter and leaves the trauma behind.I think the movie was very good, especially for that time (1973). The special effects were good, example of that is; the scene where Regan comes down the stairs like a spider. The film was very good constructed and formed for that time, it was a new type of genre in the film industry, it was the beginning of horror in the film history and it was and still is one of the best horror films ever made.The storyline of the movie was also good. You get a good impression of how it happened and you can really find yourself in the movie. The film maker wanted the people to really think about the film and used good techniques for this. He gave the characters a lot of emotion and made the movie sad in some aspects, of course the main sad part is about Regan, but also father Karras is very sad because he lost his mother. This made the movie better and it helped to keep the watcher's attention throughout the film.In conclusion, you could say that The Exorcist is a really good film for the time it was made and still is a very good film. It is the base of any horror film and helped the genre to develop. I would really recommend the film to you, because you will be entertained throughout the film. The filmmaker used good techniques to keep the watcher attracted and made the movie scarier which is the principal of a good horror movie.

I must admit that i watched it out Of curiosity for its being on the top of the IMDb list. I wasn't disappointed. Rather felt a sense of victory. It doesn't have any action sequences or any romance or Anything of the sort. But it is one of those films that makes you feel Happy inside and yet sad that you may live many more years and watch Tons of movies but never feel the same climax or emotion that you get Out of this movie. This movie had the most powerful cast and amazing script, and all based on an awesome prison drama novel by horror-master Stephen King!Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is sent to Shawshank State Penitentiary in 1947 for the cold-blooded murder of his wife and her lover. Over the next 19 years, he does what he can to stay above the mire, consisting not only of the cruelty of his fellow inmates but the heavy hand of a brutal warden, Norton (Bob Gunton), a sadist who thumps his Bible while telling his charges that salvation lies within. Andy's stubborn refusal to give up hope in the face of his incarceration engenders the wonder and friendship of several inmates, especially Red Redding (Morgan Freeman), who nevertheless wonders about Andy's state of mind.Robbins depicts Andy Dufresne to be a reserved, humble protagonist. It is well-known that other actors were considered to play this role, such as Tom Hanks, but I believe Robbins's presence works wonders for the storyline, allowing Andy to have a quiet temperament that lets him seem at peace with himself. He has nothing on his resume close to his performance here. Freeman puts on arguably the greatest performance of his lifetime in this movie. His narration lets the viewer connect even further with all the characters, and has a poignance that stays with you long after the credits roll. His rehabilitated speech ranks right up there as one of the all-time great movie moments.Character development is greatly utilized here. Pop culture references (Rita Hayworth, Hank Williams, John F. Kennedy) help give one the impression of the passage of years, and Andy's brave, witty exploits make him a likable hero. Violence and death are also put to use, with several characters dying within the story. We are made to embrace these seemingly real individuals during their airtime, and are hence moved by their tragic deaths. The failures of these characters make the final scenes of the film all the sweeter.Another standout feature of The Shawshank Redemption is the music. Oh, the music! Thomas Newman's musical score shines brightly and lends another dimension to this heartfelt tale. The triumphant piece heard at the end is one that you've likely heard before &#x97; as it has been used in movie trailers all over the world. The fact that The Shawshank Redemption did not win an Oscar for its musical score (or in any category for that matter) is almost incomprehensible. Though in a '94 class along with Forrest Gump, Pulp Fiction, and The Lion King, I suppose it can be understood.I will note that it is a definite 'must see' for all those who consider themselves movie connoisseurs. There are not too many negatives (if any) that can be said on the film. I will state, however, it's current #1 ranking on the IMDb Top 250 is a little bit high though.I guess I'm a little nit-picky, but my main beef is with the ending. The whole movie is about hope. *SPOILERS ALERT* If you wanted hope, then you should not have ended on a cheesy last scene where the old friends reunite and everything is alright. *SPOILERS END* It was touching, no doubt about it, but then the message of hope is dwarfed by our excitement that the two friends are together again. We leave the movie smiling instead of thinking. What I'm trying to say is that to make the core message stick to the viewers, the movie should have ended the scene before, when Red boards the bus and says, I hope I can make it across the border. I hope to see my friend and shake his hand. I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams&#x85; I hope. And as the bus drives away from the camera, the credits roll.

It does start off alright, but the last forty five minutes especially is so weird, creepy and dull it spoils the whole movie on its own. The production values are not that good, the special effects in particular look as though they were made on the cheap. The whole film is poorly scripted with jokes that made me groan rather than laugh, the story is bizarre in a distasteful way and the acting is poor. Howard is annoying, Lea Thompson plays it straight to the point you want to give her a steroid shot and Tim Robbins mugs embarrassingly. All in all, a real mess. 1\/10 Bethany Cox ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy"},{"date":"1 June 2011","score":"3 out of 10 people found the following review useful","review":" After hearing so many positive things about this movie, I'm utterly shocked at how it turned out!

That in itself can be a problem, because you're expecting a lot when you watch it for the first time. Unfortunately, for me at least, this didn't quite live up to its billing. It was a good movie, Alfred Hitchcock did a good job of directing with a number of what are today recognized as typical Hitckcock-ian touches, particularly with some very effective camera work, and basically the cast, headed by Anthony Perkins as motel owner Norman Bates and supported by Janet Leigh, Vera Miles, John Gavin and Martin Balsam (I would say in that order of importance to the story) did a fine job. Still, I was expecting something more.First, I would call this more of a suspense movie with a touch of slasher movie thrown in than a horror movie, although that's admittedly through a modern lens. There are really only a couple of scenes that were horrific - one being the famous shower scene and one being the revelation of Norman's mother near the end of the movie. Otherwise you get a mystery - with the end surprise being fairly clearly telegraphed to anyone who was paying attention. The suspense starts with Marion (Leigh) stealing a large sum of money from the real estate agency where she works and running off, eventually coming to the Bates Motel to spend the night. Since the murder in the shower is the classic scene of the movie, you don't expect it to come as early as it does, and you don't expect that so much of the movie is going to revolve around Lila (Miles) and Sam (Gavin) as they search for Marion. Somehow, I expected to see more of Janet Leigh. Still, there is good suspense even if the surprise about Norman's mother is pretty clear from even a mile away.What knocked this down a bit for me, though, wasn't the obvious solution to the mystery. It was the seeming need to offer a very in depth psychological explanation near the end of what Norman was all about. Maybe there was a sense that movie-goers in 1960 would need such an explanation. I found what was virtually a closing soliloquy (and a very long one) by Simon Oakland playing a psychiatrist who's called in to examine Norman to be tedious in the extreme, and largely unnecessary; filled with psycho-babble. Norman could have been explained - if an explanation was felt necessary - much more succinctly.One can't diss this movie. There's really very little wrong with it, except that its reputation makes it very hard for it to live up to when you watch it. Undoubtedly, when watched with late 20th-21st century eyes (well conditioned to the point of being almost oblivious to slasher-type violence) it comes across as a bit dull, frankly. Equally undoubtedly, it didn't come across that way to audiences in 1960. Still, I found it to be a little bit of a letdown compared to what I was expecting of it.

The Buddy Holly Story is a movie about one of these legends that prematurely deserted our world, but whose style of music never ceased to appeal and influence coming generations  Buddy Holly, one of the most influential Rock and Roll pioneers. His career didn't last more than one year and half, yet he would change the face of music forever, inspiring many generation of singers, among them, The Beatles and Bob Dylan &#x85; he would even inspire one of the most touching and beautiful songs ever, Don McLean's famous eulogy about that tragic February day where the Music died &#x85; And I started mentioning the tragedy; because I'm sure everyone who watches the film has the accident in mind, anxiously waiting for it. The apprehension becomes sadness as we're absorbed by the character's charisma, his good-hearted nature and enthusiastic attitude. We're sad because we develop an obvious fondness for Buddy Holly, this tall nerdy guy whose physical appearance would fit more for an astrophysics student.

From his beginning in the ice skating station, to his confrontation with the racist Nashville music manager and the New York producer, we respect Buddy Holly, both the artist who knows his value and the man of principles who means business. This respect is stimulated by his incredible show in the iconic Apollo theater, where he handles a skeptical black audience with a nervousness repressed by humor, we didn't expect you either before giving a virtuoso performance that would launch his stardom. His whole life is lead by a dedication to his work, and an extraordinarily frenetic energy communicated during his concerts, while singing That'll be the Day or Rock Around with Ollie Vee. I don't think there was any moment my feet stopped following the rhythm, and while watching him swaying his hips and walking on his toes, I couldn't help but think that Elvis Presley's status owes something to Buddy's precocious death. And if his life is dedicated to music, his heart is for Maria Elena. The film is not just a chronicle on Rock and Roll music or a 50's time capsule, it's about a man whose convictions don't only affect his approach to music, but to love, too. The Buddy Holly Story is a poignant love story with a nice little humorous touch as in the scene where Buddy asks Maria's aunt if he can date her niece. Maria will inspire Buddy Holly's famous love songs including True Love Ways, Words of Love, becoming the heart of his music, before being forever known as the widowed bride. A sad destiny for a woman we wish she could have prevented Buddy from going on this doomed winter part tour, if she wasn't pregnant. Ironically, Buddy's commitment indirectly killed him, while he could have become an established and sedentary artist comfortably seated in a TV driven stardom. In a flash of realization, Buddy understood that his life was on stage.And all our admiration to Buddy relies on Gary Busey's extraordinary performance. I never thought the man I remembered as Mr. Joshua from Lethal Weapon and countless forgettable villainous roles, could blow me away like he did. But after watching Steve Rash's film, my respect for Busey increased, so did my sorrow to learn that his career may have been more successful if it wasn't for an accident the actor had in the 80's. When you pull such an authentic performance, I'm sure you can handle anything. A very well deserved Oscar nomination for a performance harder than Jamie Foxx in Ray because, there are many mimics, speech mannerisms or attitudes immediately indicative of Ray Charles while Busey had to resurrect Buddy giving him an unknown aura, a personality, likable and complex, and last but not least, he did the whole singing and dancing.

It's close to three hours long, but at least half of it is devoted to the incredible battle sequences. A combination of stylistic cameramanship and sound effects help immerse the audience in the shoes of the soldiers, and it has to be seen to be experienced.The story for this is fine and dandy, and is a serviceable platform for shuffling the characters along their journey. It's also integral for diving into some strong themes concerning the war, the human spirit, and philosophy. The film takes every intellectual advantage of the story's nuances, and with a cast of quality characters, the film does have plenty of strengths.One problem I have is the plausibility of the story. No way in heck would the Army risk eight men to rescue one, regardless of the circumstance. Surely, if they did this for Ryan, why not everybody else suffering from losses? Then, who would be left to fight? Singling out one soldier just never made sense to me. Incidentally, it didn't make sense to the story's characters either, and as they discuss and find the value in the issue, the story works in its own bizarre way.Additionally, the scene in the middle of the film (where the soldiers charge after a target of opportunity) struck me as dumb and unnecessary. The main character became uncharacteristically arrogant at this point, and the scene overall felt out-of-place. I almost suspect that it could have been removed from the film completely. I'm also not fond of the film's commemorative beginning and closing; it strikes me as manipulative and overly-sentimental.Otherwise, the film is exceptionally strong. Despite some herky-jerky cameramanship, I do love the photography throughout; there are lots of intimate close-ups and interesting long-shots, they are all full of detail. Acting is really good; Tom Hanks is the man, Tom Sizemore is not bad, Edward Burns is cool, I loved Barry Pepper's role, Matt Damon is surprisingly strong, and it's interesting seeing Vin Diesel in the mix. Writing has a lot of interesting and bright moments. Production value is very strong, with highly-detailed and seemingly-realistic sets, props, costumes, locations, vehicles, weapons, and everything.

The main character became uncharacteristically arrogant at this point, and the scene overall felt out-of-place. I almost suspect that it could have been removed from the film completely. I'm also not fond of the film's commemorative beginning and closing; it strikes me as manipulative and overly-sentimental.Otherwise, the film is exceptionally strong. Despite some herky-jerky cameramanship, I do love the photography throughout; there are lots of intimate close-ups and interesting long-shots, they are all full of detail. Acting is really good; Tom Hanks is the man, Tom Sizemore is not bad, Edward Burns is cool, I loved Barry Pepper's role, Matt Damon is surprisingly strong, and it's interesting seeing Vin Diesel in the mix. Writing has a lot of interesting and bright moments. Production value is very strong, with highly-detailed and seemingly-realistic sets, props, costumes, locations, vehicles, weapons, and everything.

The battles are long, bloody, and intense. In between, each scene is loaded with tension and suspense. In every scene, there's immaculate detail that showcases war (and the battle of Omaha beach specifically) in the most realistic light possible. It's close to three hours long, but at least half of it is devoted to the incredible battle sequences. A combination of stylistic cameramanship and sound effects help immerse the audience in the shoes of the soldiers, and it has to be seen to be experienced.The story for this is fine and dandy, and is a serviceable platform for shuffling the characters along their journey. It's also integral for diving into some strong themes concerning the war, the human spirit, and philosophy. The film takes every intellectual advantage of the story's nuances, and with a cast of quality characters, the film does have plenty of strengths.One problem I have is the plausibility of the story. No way in heck would the Army risk eight men to rescue one, regardless of the circumstance. Surely, if they did this for Ryan, why not everybody else suffering from losses? Then, who would be left to fight? Singling out one soldier just never made sense to me.

In the film, Bergman closely examines the relationship of these three sisters and the maid while also dealing with the individual lives and struggles of the emotionally crippled Karin and Maria.Maria, a married woman, hides behind the adultery she commits and is both physically and mentally incapable of handling any sort of confrontation. Karin on the other hand is very reserved and absolutely afraid of opening up or expressing herself to anyone, including her own husband who appears oblivious to her condition. To get over each's problems, the girls eventually confide in each other in a very emotionally charged moment in the film. Unfortunately, the next day things seem to go back to how they were before, as if Bergman were saying that opening up and touching someone are important first steps, but don't actually seem to solve the deeply rooted problem. Maria on the other hand acknowledges their bonding experience from the night before but is initially shunned by her sister.Anna, the maid, is a character dealing with her own storyline opposite these two sisters. Anna appears to be the only one who is capable of unconditional love and actually provides the most warmth and comfort for Agnes on her deathbed.I personally found Agnes to be the most fascinating character of the bunch. Her ability to take comfort and find happiness in the smallest things such as the stroll through the garden with her sisters at the onset of her illness. Agnes seems to be the only sister who takes complete solace and refuge in the presence of the other two. The final line in the movie, a quote from Agnes' journal, shows her appreciation and love for those around her and for what life has given her, stating she is thankful for the presence of her sisters. I found this particularly bittersweet it is good to know Agnes felt so good around her sisters but I seriously doubt her sisters ever really reciprocated the love, at least when not in direct contact with her. The question I always have about Agnes is whether she had this profound love and appreciation for love before she got sick, or if this love came because of her cancer diagnosis. I like to think that it was the former, but it is a well known fact that people do tend to feel this empathy towards the end of their lives, or at least, are more comfortable expressing these feelings.Bergman does an absolutely incredible shooting the film, from the angles he choose for the camera to the stylistics with deep tones of red complementing the rest of the rather white and monotonous backdrop. This is a beautiful film that will leave any audience member thinking about life and those closest to them once they finish viewing.

I got sucked right in by his performance and had to keep reminding myself that Penn is not only perfectly normal but probably highly intelligent as well. Dakota Fanning is charming, precocious and a joy to watch. Michelle Pfeiffer is always a treat and does not disappoint here. Her transformation from cold, calculating and cynical lawyer with a 'perfect' life to someone warmer, vulnerable and with a less than perfect life, is almost as important a sub-plot as the main story of Sam's struggle to keep his beloved daughter.The premise of the movie is nothing new, but I don't think I've ever seen such delicate and inspired handling of a situation that could so easily have descended into a maudlin melodrama, given its potential for pain and heartache. Plenty of humour and the energetic pacing keep things from being weighed down.The ending is not unexpected, but I really couldn't have seen it going any other way. Definitely recommended for the all around strong performances.

Movies often have lines that become part of our culture. The line from this one is hoo-ha!This film may look plain but it isn't it's a very strong one, showing us how someone who lost all faith in life (Frank &#x96; Al Pacino) can learn from someone whose life may end by doing something right (Charlie &#x96; Chris O'Donnell) not selling himself for his future. At the same time, Charlie will learn that sometimes you shouldn't trust everything people tell you usually it is easier to speak the right thing than actually DO the right thing. It is a beautiful film, to be watched peacefully believe me, if in the beginning you will wonder how it is possible that someone like Colonel Frank Slade, by the end you will like him more that you thought possible.SCENT OF A WOMAN (1992) is an outstanding piece of work! The legendary Al Pacino FINALLY took home the coveted Best Actor Oscar for his brilliant work in this film and he shouldn't have to apologize for it. Yes, he should have won for his work in THE GODFATHER and SCARFACE, but too many actors to be named have been sadly overlooked for their best work.Pacino perfectly essays the role of retired Colonel Frank Slade, who was compelled to retirement being blinded during duty(due to his own stupidity and drinking habit). Stuck living with his niece and her family in their guest house and drawing monthly stipends from the government, Col. Slade is an embittered man of late middle age. Slade's niece has hired local boys' school student Charlie Simms (young Chris O'Donnell in a very underrated, genuine performance) to take care of Frank for the weekend during the Thanksgiving holidays. Slade opts to take Charlie with him on a weekend of luxury and reckless abandon in New York. Meanwhile, Charlie must wrestle with the moral dilemma of should he or shouldn't he squeal on his fellow classmates, who he along with another student saw commit a punishable act prior to the holidays. Charlie is to go before the disciplinary board upon his return. Charlie and Frank are two extraordinary actors in the film, Scent of a Woman. They are a perfect pair, one who has always stood firmly for what he believes in and the other one who is learning how to do just that.Still of Al Pacino and Gabrielle Anwar in Scent Of A WomanAl Pacino is extraordinary, he steals every scene he is in, truly crafting a superb and incredible performance. One of his greatest performances ever and in the history of cinema. Chris O'Donnell is marvelous, a great performance. It's absolutely unforgettable and flawless. The supporting cast is golden, too .Gabrielle Anwar (charming as the beautiful young lady that Slade gets to tango with!), the always reliable James Rebhorn (pitch perfect as the stern headmaster of the boys' school), a young-looking Phillip Seymour Hoffman (terrific as Charlie's shifty best friend at the boy's school, who was his fellow witness), Richard Venture (as Frank's older brother W.R. Slade), a young Bradley Whitford (wonderful as Frank's resentful nephew Randy in my favorite scene of the film!), Ron Eldard (winning as the NY cop who stops Slade and Charlie for speeding), and a young and vibrant Frances Conroy (as an English teacher at Charlie's school who I always imagine that Frank ends up with!).There are great scenes in Scent of a Woman from the ruckus at Thanksgiving dinner when Frank takes Charlie, both uninvited, to his brother's house where the relatives don't think much of him to at one point driving a Ferrari despite being blind. But the most wonderful moments are the few on the dance floor. The scene of Frank(Al) and Donna(Gabrielle) doesn't get out of my thoughts. From the moment he catches her perfume, through the introduction, till the sweetest tango dance ever. Of course, the choice for Donna &#x96; Gabrielle Anwar, is perfect, she plays the shy (very) pretty woman very good. The scene when the colonel wants to shoot himself and suddenly decides to shoot the boy,too is brilliant. The fight between the two men -as well as Charlie's attempt to convince the colonel give up his plan- is full of suspense and very well structured, so it's impossible to anticipate how the things will work out. The climax scene in the disciplinary meeting, though a bit clichéd, is wonderful. Pacino's speech is absolutely amazing. He delivers it with a panache.The big lesson from SCENT OF A WOMAN is about the true meaning of honor. I like the dichotomy of Slade's situation with Charlie's and how Charlie, the student, inadvertently teaches Slade a valuable life lesson, that through the toughest of times and situations, it is the human SPIRIT that must remain intact if one is to truly LIVE!Riveting, electrifying and satisfying. A magnificent film. A heartfelt, funny and outstanding experience. Powerful and very touching throughout. An excellent movie in every way. Superb storytelling and stunningly crafted. A towering and masterful drama. Wickedly funny and spectacular. A film you cant turn away from. You cant stop but smile when you think of this movie. A two and a half hour pleasure from start to finish.Nominated for Best Picture, directed by Oscar nominated director Martin Brest (MIDNIGHT RUN, BEVERLY HILLS COP) and starring the one and only Al Pacino in his Oscar-winning role, SCENT OF A WOMAN is a film to enjoy over and over!

Within those few minutes we were swept away. Wayans characterization is pitch perfect and should have spawned a sequel, or as one reviewer stated a TV series. There is no political correctness here, just fun and humor that kids of all ages and my wife and I enjoyed. I am no longer married, but I did get the copy of Major Payne in the divorce and still watch it with the kids We laugh at it, remember the good times and can talk and still offer to Show you something to take your mind off that pain. W.C Fields hated to work with kids because he feared they would upstage him. Damon Wayans has NO problem here. I wish more movies were funny on so many levels. Have introduced my youngest, who was not alive when the movie came out, to the Major. He still talks about Mr Peebody. This is truly an under rated gem of a movie and fun for the whole family.

When his wife, played by Meryl Streep, decides this is too suffocating an existence for her, she bolts. This leaves Hoffman with the onus of balancing his work with trying to raise a young boy (Justin Henry) that he barely knows. Once the two bond in the absence of Streep, she returns to sue for custody of the boy and the film delves into a protracted court battle as to who would be the better parent.There is nothing especially surprising in Kramer vs. Kramer, but it is the execution that brings it together. Director Benton knows how to present everything in a matter-of-fact fashion with enough emotional impact to ring true with the viewer. And while the film maintains enough of an aloofness that fails to wring all of the drama out of the material it could, it certainly does engage the viewer and elicit our sympathy for the main characters.Hoffman is quite good in a no-nonsense performance as the man who evolves from driven career guy to loving father figure. Henry is solid, but I think granting him an Oscar nomination was pushing it. Ditto, Meryl Streep. I love Streep as an actress, but I think it is unfortunate that her two Oscars were awarded so early in her career before we really got to see the kind of range she was capable of. Her Oscar for this film is indeed puzzling as Joanna Kramer functions as little more than a plot device. She is included to cause the crisis that starts the melodrama and brings the father and son together, and then returns at an appropriate moment to cause crisis number two in the guise of the custody trial. Watching Streep in this film now, one is amazed that she comes off as so flat and emotionless - even in scenes with her son. This performance fails to hint at the kind of acting legend that she would deservedly become in a few years time and the Oscar thus seems wasted on her here. By contrast, Jane Alexander makes a much more believable contender as a concerned neighbor, who initially chides Hoffman for his selfishness before ultimately becoming one of his defenders. It is a very well done and nicely layered performance.The film also brings up the canard of a legal system that favors the mother over the father without any justification, but it fails to mention that there were\/are many states that favor the father over the mother. As a child of divorce myself, I was consistently confounded by a Maryland legal system that constantly gave special treatment to a father who was a violent alcoholic, but seemed to feel that a mother who had none of those issues was second class. Yet KvK often fails to mention that there are places where the pendulum swings in the other direction and somehow makes it seem that only mothers get preferential treatment.Additionally, it becomes a bit annoying that the film wants to deify Hoffman for balancing work and child-rearing like it is some sort of impossible miracle, but fails to mention that there are tons of single parents, especially women, that were doing what he does in this film for years previously without any glorification whatsoever. Really, what choice did Hoffman's character have in light of the events? Much like the legal system it derides, the film often stacks the deck in favor of Hoffman's dad and barely averts making mom Streep into some kind of one-dimensional villain. The final moments of the film avoid such a development with a not entirely convincing about-face on the part of her character, but prior to that Mom is really little more than a forgotten contrivance who enters and exits the action based solely on how it will impact the central father\/son pairing. There is something just a tad irritating about that.Yet even with that rather glaring flaw, it is impossible to deny that KvK does succeed in its modest goals thanks in large part to Benton's assured director, and heartfelt performances from Hoffman and Alexander.
