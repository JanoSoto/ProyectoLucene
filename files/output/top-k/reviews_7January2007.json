Still, at least they let Affleck make a sarcastic comment about the gay guy's role; a bit of unexpected but ultimately insufficient irony.

Sure, Clint Eastwood is Clint in every movie he plays, and the same goes for Bronson and some others, but with a big difference those guys have charisma, i.e. we want to see Clint be Clint and so on but we don't ever want to see Ben be Ben because Ben isn't charismatic but simply a 90s Hollywood brat.

There is a list of male and a list of female actresses who are paired up every now and then (read far too often) for various romantic dramas or romantic comedies that are always based on clichéd scripts; movies that promise cash once the women and the girls in the audience start taking out those handkerchiefs out (usually towards the end of the movie) so that they can wet them with their tears of soap-operatic self-delusion.The men The women George Clooney Michelle Pfeiffer Bruce Willis Salma Hayek Ben Affleck Jennifer Lopez Keanu Reeves Sandra Bullock Matthew MacConaughey Winona Ryder Richard Gere Gwyneth Paltrow Hugh Grant Meg Ryan Tom Hanks Julia Roberts Nicolas Cage Charlize TheronPair up any of these randomly, placing them in a movie about on-&-off love in which usually someone has a terminal illness or someone is from a different social class than the other, etc, and you can make your own 90s soap movie with very little entertainment or cinematic value.

This pathetic little film wants to have the cake and eat it, too. Sayles and Dante put some humour to make it look like a spoof of Jaws, but at the same time hoped to make the movie exciting. They never even got close to the cake; the film is neither funny nor exciting. From what I know, a spoof is supposed to be funny and make us laugh at its target. The jokes bomb 99% of the time, and instead of laughing at Jaws I wished I was watching it instead of this garbage. As for the action, as far as I can recall an action film involves a little thing we call excitement. This garbage is about as exciting as a Bergman family drama. Dante's first film leaves absolutely no hints - zero - that he would proceed to later make some good films. His directing is unimaginative - spoof or not, a direct rip-off of the action sequences from Jaws, only boring. The entire action sequence in which the little critters attack a group of children is so badly directed that the kids appear as though they are having a good time and not fighting for their lives! I cannot think of any other movie that left me so cold and unexcited at the prospect of a couple of kids getting massacred. I mean, if the viewer doesn't get emotionally involved about kids getting butchered by savage animals then there is something seriously wrong with the movie!

Real piranhas are, of course, not that smart; they are just fish. However, even real piranhas are smarter than a John Sayles script. This Marxist, left-wing, wanna-be intellectual actually makes both the army AND the police the bad guys. The military is so evil that they actually do all that is in their power to prevent potential swimmers getting warned; to the extent that it almost appears as though they are doing everything they can to make sure the piranhas kill as many humans as possible! This isn't original. This isn't funny. This isn't quirky. It's imbecilic and annoying; an insult to the viewer's intelligence. Barbara Steele is a scientist working for the military who - for no explanation whatsoever - does all that she can to ensure that the piranhas continue their business of slaughter. Of course, the whole mutation fiasco was a military experiment to help them win wars, blablablabla. This pitiful film isn't a spoof of old B-movies. It IS a B-movie.

Hitchcock is notorious for making overrated movies. This is another one. While not nearly as heavy on illogic as some of his other movies, it doesn't really grip you; it's merely interesting, but hardly in a spellbinding way. There are no surprise twists at all, but I guess I should be thankful because those usually spell illogic in his movies. The climax is hardly amazingly suspenseful, as Maltin the Really Bad Movie Critic states in his silly little book. There is a decent ending but I failed to notice any drops of sweat sliding down my forehead. Amazingly suspenseful...? What was Maltin on when he saw it? Doesn't he know you're supposed to take LSD for 2001 and not for thrillers...? The illogic isn't major (for a Hitchcock movie) but it's there 1) first there is that strange appearance by the head of the American spy agency (let's call him ABC) while Bergman and Rains are having dinner. Rains recognizes ABC why the hell would ABC want Rains to notice him? Why should anyone want Rains to even suspect that American spies are following his every move? Shouldn't ABC be hiding, or at least not flashing his presence in Rio? 2) the same goes for Grant; it would make more sense for Bergman to approach Rains (while horse-riding) alone, instead of accompanied by a U.S. agent, 3) how come both Bergman and Grant - two apparently intelligent people - failed to notice the flaw in their wine-cellar plan namely, if she steals the key from Rains and he decides to go to the cellar during the party he will unavoidably notice that his key is missing, and put 2 and 2 together? 4) It isn't exactly illogical, but it is far-fetched that Rains never suspected that him bumping into Bergman - in Rio, and not some place like Kartoffelsaladstadt - was too huge a coincidence; sure, he was smitten with her, but he also new of the presence of American agents and the paranoia in him should have rang a bell of warning; this goes even more so for his Nazi colleagues who should have suspected something since they didn't have love to cloud their judgment; it would have been logical for them to get suspicious about her sudden appearance.The relationship between Bergman and Grant - i.e. the characterization - is rushed, and as a result there are some rather off-kilter verbal exchanges between them early on. Bergman has very little beauty to offer. I don't know whether she was always like this or whether she got uglier, but her bones are bigger than that of a Swedish wrestler. And check out those hands and fingers! They look like they might belong to a rugged peasant, and not a Hollywood diva. Her face only looks good from the profile; from the front it looks like Ted Kennedy's head &#150; i.e. a big, wide watermelon. Bergman has as many facial muscles as Grant, f'rcrissakes.

Shouldn't ABC be hiding, or at least not flashing his presence in Rio? 2) the same goes for Grant; it would make more sense for Bergman to approach Rains (while horse-riding) alone, instead of accompanied by a U.S. agent, 3) how come both Bergman and Grant - two apparently intelligent people - failed to notice the flaw in their wine-cellar plan namely, if she steals the key from Rains and he decides to go to the cellar during the party he will unavoidably notice that his key is missing, and put 2 and 2 together? 4) It isn't exactly illogical, but it is far-fetched that Rains never suspected that him bumping into Bergman - in Rio, and not some place like Kartoffelsaladstadt - was too huge a coincidence; sure, he was smitten with her, but he also new of the presence of American agents and the paranoia in him should have rang a bell of warning; this goes even more so for his Nazi colleagues who should have suspected something since they didn't have love to cloud their judgment; it would have been logical for them to get suspicious about her sudden appearance.The relationship between Bergman and Grant - i.e. the characterization - is rushed, and as a result there are some rather off-kilter verbal exchanges between them early on. Bergman has very little beauty to offer. I don't know whether she was always like this or whether she got uglier, but her bones are bigger than that of a Swedish wrestler. And check out those hands and fingers! They look like they might belong to a rugged peasant, and not a Hollywood diva. Her face only looks good from the profile; from the front it looks like Ted Kennedy's head &#150; i.e. a big, wide watermelon. Bergman has as many facial muscles as Grant, f'rcrissakes. I think that, standing next to a real woman like Heyward or Colbert, Bergman would look like a giant oak tree by comparison.If you're interested in reading my biographies of Ingrid Bergman and other Hollywood persons, contact me by e-mail.

It's amazing why a film that is virtually a remake of Tommy Boy can be so much worse but there you have it.Chris Farley was funny and his years on Saturday Night Live proves that he was more than just a bumbling fool as he is portrayed here. The movie starts out kind of strange when we see him working at some kind of civics center. In an attempt to make him kind of sympathetic, we see him bonding with some kid but that side of the story wouldn't have been that interesting and is left a subplot that eats only a minute more of screen time.So what do we get. We get Tim Matheson playing his brother running for governor (in a totally unnecessary part. Simply there because Farley's idol, John Belushi and he were friends). We get his sniveling campaign manager another sleazy guy performance by Timothy Carhart (remember him from Thelma and Louise?). We get another of Belushi's compadres Bruce McGill as the opposing side's campaign manager and finally David Spade as himself. This setup could have been funny but is absolutely played as a setup to Farley's character messing everything up for his brother with slapstick sequences (or anti-slapstick as we feel every bit of pain that Farley feels). If we had seen Farley arguing with people for his brother's votes in the same vein he did with brake pads in Tommy Boy this could have been much better. Why rip something off and then completely screw up everything the original stood for?There are some scenes here that are so painful to watch that it makes you sick 1) Farley's encounter with a bat. Spade covers him in a blanket and whacks the living crap out of him. This was probably a take on the scene with the bees in Tommy Boy. It falls flat on it's ugly face.2) Farley getting stoned and shouting out 60's slogans to cheers at a rock concert and screws it up by screaming Kill Whitey. It has never been funny not even sitcom funny.3) Spade's face off with a crazy Vietnam vet. This is like seeing the worst Police Academy movie you can think off. Spade was in one of the worst so maybe he liked it.Ready for the best part Farley actually finds out that the election is rigged at the last minute. This is so unlikely after we seen him stumble through one blunder after another that I was scratching my head in disbelief.

We get Tim Matheson playing his brother running for governor (in a totally unnecessary part. Simply there because Farley's idol, John Belushi and he were friends). We get his sniveling campaign manager another sleazy guy performance by Timothy Carhart (remember him from Thelma and Louise?). We get another of Belushi's compadres Bruce McGill as the opposing side's campaign manager and finally David Spade as himself.

If we had seen Farley arguing with people for his brother's votes in the same vein he did with brake pads in Tommy Boy this could have been much better. Why rip something off and then completely screw up everything the original stood for?There are some scenes here that are so painful to watch that it makes you sick 1) Farley's encounter with a bat. Spade covers him in a blanket and whacks the living crap out of him. This was probably a take on the scene with the bees in Tommy Boy. It falls flat on it's ugly face.2) Farley getting stoned and shouting out 60's slogans to cheers at a rock concert and screws it up by screaming Kill Whitey. It has never been funny not even sitcom funny.3) Spade's face off with a crazy Vietnam vet. This is like seeing the worst Police Academy movie you can think off.

Unfortunately, she like so many other young ladies, falls under the spell of a bad boy named David (Wahlberg). We the audience can tell from the start that David and his buddies are at the very least shady, and at the very worst homicidal maniacs. Nicole realizes this too after a while.

One afternoon a couple of punks get into the building and brutally rape his daughter and viciously attack his wife. When he gets to the hospital his daughter has slowly fallen into a vegetable state and his wife has died. The grief starts to hit home and Paul takes a work related trip, where he meets a client that takes him to a shooting range and as a farewell gift he receives a 32-calibre revolver. When he returns home, he takes the law into his own hands by dishing out his own justice aimed at crooks.This was the first time I got to watch this one uncut and its still an unheralded cynical urban vigilante piece that only few can match. This supreme item maybe not as shocking, unsparing and cruel like you would think (instead wait around for Death Wish 2 1981), but more so a thoughtfully glum character study and a left-wing political pot shot (pro-gun and vigilante support) slanted into the controversial context.We follow one anti-hero coming with the terms of the confronting ordeal he has encountered and he had enough of watching the crims get-away with things. While the police can't lift a finger to prevent it. So what to do, well no more sitting back and take the law into his hands. We watch the main character spiral into some sort of craving to vent out his pain and anger. He can't seem to stop seeking out crims and thugs, after his somewhat nervous first strike. But even when the police are hinting that they know its him, the rush of it all is just too much to let go and the society doesn't want to take it for granted anymore. So in the context there's little more too it, then just a fully blood revenge pick. Although, there's nothing really too deep there, but it gives us a touch of insight in what's going on in our protagonist's mind and seems to blame the failing system and a depraved society for his actions. It's not really explained through dialogues or emotions, as they are mostly spare here. The broad actions are what tell the story and it suits Charles Bronson's hardened persona. Paul Kersey would go on to be Bronson's iconic role with four sequels to follow on.Director Michael Winner paints a chillingly dread-filled setting of New York and illustrates the savage intentions of those muggers that seem to over-populate the streets. Winner's tightly constructed direction keeps it moving and smoothly patterns out the violence with great control and grit. It's in your face, but his direction suit's the style of film he was going for here. A dynamically breezy score by Herbie Hancock is well integrated into the formula and Arthur J. Ornitz's steely camera-work shapes the film's hard edge. The clunky story is as straightforward as can be and rather heavy-handed in what its got to say. Engraved is a black sense of humour (which more arose from the cops on the case). Charles Bronson nails down the part and brings to his upholding character a well-mannered vibe that could turn unyieldingly cold-hearted when called for. The rest of the performances are fine with Vincent Gardenia standing out amongst the pack as wry police detective and there are minor roles from Jeff Goldblum and Christopher Guest.A very influential studio exploitation flick of the 70s that wasn't afraid to get its hands dirty and speak its mind. It's maybe not as lowbrow as it could have been, but it still manages to keep one transfixed.

One afternoon a couple of punks get into the building and brutally rape his daughter and viciously attack his wife. When he gets to the hospital his daughter has slowly fallen into a vegetable state and his wife has died. The grief starts to hit home and Paul takes a work related trip, where he meets a client that takes him to a shooting range and as a farewell gift he receives a 32-calibre revolver. When he returns home, he takes the law into his own hands by dishing out his own justice aimed at crooks.This was the first time I got to watch this one uncut and its still an unheralded cynical urban vigilante piece that only few can match. This supreme item maybe not as shocking, unsparing and cruel like you would think (instead wait around for Death Wish 2 1981), but more so a thoughtfully glum character study and a left-wing political pot shot (pro-gun and vigilante support) slanted into the controversial context.We follow one anti-hero coming with the terms of the confronting ordeal he has encountered and he had enough of watching the crims get-away with things. While the police can't lift a finger to prevent it. So what to do, well no more sitting back and take the law into his hands. We watch the main character spiral into some sort of craving to vent out his pain and anger. He can't seem to stop seeking out crims and thugs, after his somewhat nervous first strike. But even when the police are hinting that they know its him, the rush of it all is just too much to let go and the society doesn't want to take it for granted anymore. So in the context there's little more too it, then just a fully blood revenge pick. Although, there's nothing really too deep there, but it gives us a touch of insight in what's going on in our protagonist's mind and seems to blame the failing system and a depraved society for his actions.

Whoever wrote this thing evidently put a lot of effort into the sometimes mind-boggling dialog. There isn't much in the way of a plot, but the kind of talking, arguing, and philosophizing that goes on here is rather unusual. And the good part is that it's very well-written. Occasionally the sentences or arguments get so bogged down into semantic mud that it becomes necessary to use the rewind button, because it's difficult to concentrate that hard for two entire hours. I think that Wright spoke for both the viewers and the cast members when she at one point hollered I can't stand this semantic insanity any more!.Practically everyone engages in the verbal entanglements, but it is Penn's character who usually outdoes everyone in this respect, and it is usually him who initiates them, right after snorting the n-th line of cocaine, or after having taken a couple of deep inhalings of hash - and those things he does throughout the whole movie (and this goes to a lesser extent for Spacey and Schandling, too). The semantic insanity sometimes goes so far that the characters replace ends of sentences with blablablabla - quite literally. The dialog is sometimes fascinating, often funny or amusing, and at times so insanely intricate that the characters themselves have trouble following what the other person exactly meant to say.This last thing, of course, leads to many amusing moments. The humorous moments themselves stem primarily from Penn's drug-induced, hallucinatory ramblings and Spacey's wonderful sarcasm and wit. In fact, the very beginning of the movie sets the tone for the way those two will interact throughout most of the picture (their relationship being important but also just one of a half-dozen) Penn is falling deeper and deeper into thickets of semantic insanity - bitching about Spacey having had a fling with Wright - while Spacey listens to him, and responds to Penn's verbal overkill by making wry remarks. In the two hours of the movie Penn is almost always whacked-out on drugs, and the more drugged he is, the more he searches for answers to the meaning of life (towards the end of the movie), the more he moans, bitches, and whines, and the more he practices his bored-out-of-my-mind philosophizing about relationships and life. In moments when he is extremely out of it - like when alone with Meg Ryan, and just after Palmintierri's funeral - he goes on such an emotional rampage, and his voice assumes such a high, crackly pitch that he sounds exactly like Bill Murray in moments when he goes a little crazy. It's by far the best Penn I've seen so far; he has rarely been good, but in this movie he is rather good, I have to admit. Spacey, of course, is great as ever, and Palmintierri gets a short while to get used to. The cast is, generally speaking, quite a colourful and mixed bag.There are a number of funny or amusing moments, so I'll just mention a couple of those that I still remember... There is the scene when Penn mentions the aborigines, and says some nonsense about them having (had) their own problems, such as tigers waiting in trees, and dogs in the bushes (or something like that). Very funny. Then there is a funny, longer scene in which Spacey tries to explain to Penn that there is no hidden message in Palmintierri's (rather moronic) suicide note, while Penn insists that they analyze the letter for hidden meanings and anagrams(!) in order to find the real truth about his pal's death.

In the second and longer version the doors are reopened slightly and maybe, just maybe, they may reunite and dispel some of Salvatore's lonely existence later on in his life.

The film is well cast and the screenplay is reasonably sensitive, but it plays out like a Chick-Flick version of One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.Substitute Winona Ryder for Brad Dourif and Angelina Jolie for Jack Nicholson, give the film a Hollywood ending and Bam! There's another worthy little classic in the can. Girl, Interrupted takes no chances and delivers a literal, layman's version of mental illness, an approach which left me cold and unsympathetic to the central character.Despite a good performance from Winona Ryder, it's clear from Day One that her character shouldn't be in a psychiatric hospital. Okay, the film is based on Susanna Kaysen's genuine experience of mental illness but her hindsight shows through in the storytelling. The character Susanna's viewpoint is too objective for someone locked up in an asylum and the other patients are too stereotypically Mad to be entirely believable. It's as if the story is being told by someone who suffered from mental illness a long time ago.Angelina Jolie does her best as Lisa Rowe (the Jack Nicholson Looks-Normal Rebel character), but is let down by a script that quickly renders her as a walking cliché. It doesn't take long to work out that her rebel act will make her attractive to Ryder's character and that there's bound to be fireworks between such an odd couple. Predictably enough, after girly high-jinks give way to darker deeds, Susanna Kaysen decides that it's time to leave when Lisa Rowe finally breaks down. Kaysen then realises that her mental health issues aren't as severe as Rowe's, something that I'd worked out about an hour and a half earlier. Kaysen is merely depressed and confused, whereas Rowe is clearly borderline psychotic. It's clear from early on that one of them will soon walk back into a normal life while the other will have to struggle with inner demons and medication for many years. I can't comment on Susanna Kaysen's book, but the film's viewpoint is too detached to be a credible account of a young woman's metal health problems. It wouldn't take many script changes to turn this movie into the story of a young journalist sent to an asylum to write an undercover piece for her newspaper. Although I have no doubt that the real Susanna Kaysen went through a very difficult period of mental illness as a young woman, her screen counterpart appears to be on some sort of nutter's field trip. While the film's approach may be realistic and sensitive, it conveys very little of the genuine anguish of mental illness. ","genre":null},{"date":"7 January 2007","score":"","review":" The problem with Girl, Interrupted is the treatment of its subject matter, mental illness. The film is well cast and the screenplay is reasonably sensitive, but it plays out like a Chick-Flick version of One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.Substitute Winona Ryder for Brad Dourif and Angelina Jolie for Jack Nicholson, give the film a Hollywood ending and Bam! There's another worthy little classic in the can. Girl, Interrupted takes no chances and delivers a literal, layman's version of mental illness, an approach which left me cold and unsympathetic to the central character.Despite a good performance from Winona Ryder, it's clear from Day One that her character shouldn't be in a psychiatric hospital. Okay, the film is based on Susanna Kaysen's genuine experience of mental illness but her hindsight shows through in the storytelling. The character Susanna's viewpoint is too objective for someone locked up in an asylum and the other patients are too stereotypically Mad to be entirely believable. It's as if the story is being told by someone who suffered from mental illness a long time ago.Angelina Jolie does her best as Lisa Rowe (the Jack Nicholson Looks-Normal Rebel character), but is let down by a script that quickly renders her as a walking cliché. It doesn't take long to work out that her rebel act will make her attractive to Ryder's character and that there's bound to be fireworks between such an odd couple. Predictably enough, after girly high-jinks give way to darker deeds, Susanna Kaysen decides that it's time to leave when Lisa Rowe finally breaks down. Kaysen then realises that her mental health issues aren't as severe as Rowe's, something that I'd worked out about an hour and a half earlier. Kaysen is merely depressed and confused, whereas Rowe is clearly borderline psychotic. It's clear from early on that one of them will soon walk back into a normal life while the other will have to struggle with inner demons and medication for many years.
