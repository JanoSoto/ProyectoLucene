Now, let's get one thing straight, this is not as bad as most people made it out to be. The acting is pretty good, and overall dialogue is decent. What really fails here is it's campy-ness, holy crap. Gotham is a futuristic, totally different cyber city, which doesn't look anything like the previous films at all. In fact, this whole film is nothing like the original films by Tim Burton, even though strangely enough Tim Burton produced it. The actual plot is pretty bland, two villains, your hero, and the cliché love interest. Nothing new here. The CGI in this film is actually horrible, considering this was done in the 90's. The characters are also just not developed right, you never actually care what's going to happen to these characters. If Batman himself died I probably wouldn't give a crap, it's that bad. However, Val Kimmer as Batman is not bad, not at all. Jim Carry is well...Jim Carry. Tommy Lee Jones is a complete idiot. Not resembling Two-Face at all, and Nicole Kidman is just your cliché woman in a super-hero movie. Overall, this movie is bearable, and it's know where near the mess that was Batman and Robin, but at the end, this movie just isn't worth your time.

This is still pretty entertaining with some of the melodrama and especially that train crash near the end. Musical numbers by Dorothy Lamour-in which a couple of her famous co-stars from other movies make an audience appearance-and Betty Hutton with Jimmy Stewart joining the latter on a trampoline also are fun to watch. And some of the actual circus acts are pretty entertaining though they're better viewed in person than on film. But this is a bit overlong and somewhat old-fashioned and doesn't really deserve the Best Picture Oscar it got for 1952. That should have gone to the really creative Singin' in the Rain which wasn't even nominated in that category (nor was it for writing which TGSOE won for Original Story). Besides the stars I mentioned above, there's also Cornel Wilde, Charlton Heston, and Gloria Grahame to look forward to. Stewart appears in clown makeup throughout for a reason revealed near the end. Only a photo of him shown on screen has his more-familiar face. And producer-director Cecil B. DeMille's narration may be a little corny, but it still works for me. So on that note, I partially recommend The Greatest Show on Earth. P.S. While this film marked a reunion for a couple of stars from my favorite movie-It's a Wonderful Life, Jimmy Stewart and Gloria Grahame, they hardly have any scenes together and rarely have dialogue between them.

By returning to the directors chair he was able to create a great continuation of the original film, bringing more iconic Gothic visuals along with a further look in to the humanity of the monster. Whale starts the film right where his original left it. We're at the burning windmill as the mob brings back Dr. Frankenstein (Colin Clive) who barely survived the encounter to the village, whilst leaving behind what they think is the burning corpse of the monster (Boris Karloff). However we discover that the monster is not dead and begins to once again wreak havoc on the countryside. In the meantime, Dr. Frankenstein is contacted by his old colleague Dr Pretorius (Ernest Thesiger) who wants to recreate Frankenstein's experiment and create a woman, the be the companion of the monster. Clive's return as Dr. Frankenstein is a great one, that should not have been cast any other way. He brings the same hysterical quality that made him the image of a mad scientist in the original Frankenstein, whilst also showing a great change to his character by resisting the requests to recreate his experiment. This means that whilst he's still fascinated in the concept of creating life, he's seen what it can do and approaches it with a new found fear of its consequences. But obviously the most important character is the monster himself, with Karloff returning to the iconic role. It's a different continuation of the role, as this time the monster learns to talk over the course of the film thus giving Karloff an even greater range to get over the conflict and turmoil of the monster. But the character is still the same icon he was in the forest, with Whale continues to explore the monsters humanity along with how society forces aggression upon the monster and causes him to rampage. Even when the monster attempts to do good, such as one scene in which he saves a drowning woman, the moment they see the beast they immediately judge him and chase him with pitchforks and torches. Through this Whale explores how things are not always as one sided as how it may at first appear. What might at first appear evil can be good. And the path that the many follow can actually be the true evil.In the film's greatest scene, we see him meet a kind blind man in the woods. When he goes in then for once there is somebody who cannot see him and does not instantly brand him as a monster. Instead he actually treats him with kindness, inviting him in as a friend, feeding him and even teaching him to speak. These are certainly the film's most heartfelt scenes as we see the monster for the first time experience true joy due to finding the comradery that he was lacking and not feeling isolated in the world. It's not until the mob tracks him down once more that his hopes of a peaceful life is dashed and he once again must continue his rampage in the woods. After this the monster begins to long for a mate and working with Dr. Pretorious, kidnaps Dr. Frankenstein's bride to force him to recreate his experiment with a women. It's dark motives and actions like these which ensure that the monster is never one sided, but instead Whale creates a very conflicted character being pushed into violence by a society that hates him and a mind of a murderer giving way to his natural instincts. There are parts of this film that I don't think work very well. For example there's some unwanted comedic relief from a maid call Minnie and a very bizarre scene where Dr. Petorious is revealed to have created miniature people that leads to a ridiculous green screen. Comedy like this just felt so out of place when also juggling with themes such as the monsters humanity or the concept of a human playing god and probably would have been better suited for a parody film like Young Frankenstein. But nonetheless this is still a great film. Whale succeeds in further exploring the complexity of one of the most iconic characters in cinema and is fitting as his finale venture in to horror.

Deep analysis on this simple question is this movie really better than the 100,000 or so other movies in IMDb? Better yet, is there something wrong with humanity if a movie about sick, violent, greedy, vengeful, hateful people gets a #2 spot? My answer to this last question is, sadly, yes. Well, at least for the bulk of humanity individually, there is no problem to rate this movie 10\/10 (in fact, there is but hey, I'm putting it into perspective here), because it is fairly entertaining. But the fact that statistically it has been rated so high shows you about the sad and devious nature of people. I, for one, have rated at least 200 movies higher than The Godfather, and I am proud of it, because I cannot convince myself that a film which tells you the story of people with the lowest possible moral can be one of the best I've seen. Main characters have to have at least a very small ray of humanity and decency in them for the movie to be really good (character depth), or else, it is just an average action movie, nothing more...8\/10 ","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"4 August 2015","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I figured I should go back and watch the earlier movies for a better grasp on the story and the Mad Max universe in general but I wish that I hadn't.We are supposed to believe that it is a post apocalyptic world but none of the characters act like.

The beloved character that Peter Graves originated on television named Jim Phelps became a treacherous rogue agent that Jon Voight played as a villain in the film that director Brian De Palma helmed. Hardcore Mission Impossible fans have never forgiven either Tom Cruise or Brian De Palma for this sacrilege. The first Mission Impossible suffers from contrivances galore. Nevertheless, Mission Impossible emerges as an exciting, suspenseful nail-biter with three electrifying set-pieces the opening computer heist debacle at an American embassy, the white-knuckled scene in the vault at the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, and the chilling train ride sequence as the finale that culminates with a helicopter being dragged by a train through the claustrophobic confines of a tunnel. The CIA vault scene ends up being the best, with the other two are slickly done. The story opens with a brief vignette that features American espionage agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise of Risky Business) masquerading as an older, mustached man orchestrating a ruse against an enemy agent by convincing his adversary that he has been instrumental in the death of a young woman. As soon as Hunt extracts the information from his disheveled adversary, they incapacitate him, revive the girl, Claire (Emmanuelle Béart of Don Juan), who is playing possum and tear down the fake motel. The next thing we know we are introduced to the cinematic incarnation of Jim Phelps, and Mission Impossible adheres slavishly to the television formula with IMF chief Phelps receiving the usual briefing from a disc that self-destructs after he is told about his latest mission should he decide to accept it. Phelps relies on his right hand man, Ethan Hunt, to coordinate the operation in Prague. The IMF is supposed to record the pilfering of the CIA's master list of Eastern Europe spies. During the mission, everything goes haywire, and everybody but Hunt dies. Ultimately, we learn that neither Phelps nor his wife Claire died. The Phelps couple staged their own deaths. Naturally, since Hunt is the last man standing, his CIA superior Eugene Kittridge (Henry Czerny of Ice Castles) suspects that he may culpable of the crime. The big revelation for Hunt is the discovery that the entire operation was 'a mole hunt' to expose a saboteur. The resourceful Hunt manages to escape from Kittridge when he uses explosive chewing gum to blow up the aquarium restaurant where he met with the CIA chieftain.Holing up in a Prague safe house, Hunt finds himself caught between a rock and a hard place. Eventually, he smokes out an arms dealer, Max (Vanessa Redgrave of Blow-Up) who pays him to steal the spy list. Since he cannot call on his former comrades because they are dead, Hunt enticed disavowed computer specialist Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames of Pulp Fiction) and pilot Franz Krieger (Jean Reno of Flyboys) who can fly a helicopter through anything. The theft of top-secret computer documents from Langley ranks as the best scene in Mission Impossible with our intrepid hero dangling from a rig in the ceiling to make himself inconspicuous to the vault security gauntlet. Watching Krieger as he uses his muscles to keep Hunt from tripping the security alarms is taut stuff. The exit that they make disguised as firefighters is clever. Like its small screen predecessor, the cinematic Mission features spectacles that boast built-in TV cameras, hidden microphones, laptop computers, agents in sophisticated covers, exploding cars, exploding chewing gum, stabbings, gunplay, bodies toppling into a river, etc. ","genre":null},{"date":"4 August 2015","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" The transition that Mission Impossible made from the small screen to the big screen ignited considerable controversy.

Arnie is the type of kid who gets pushed around by bullies and has his glasses stamped on while teachers look the other way as they think it'll probably do him some good. Things change when Arnie stumbles upon a run-down Plymouth Fury and decides to buy it, against the wishes of his parents and Dennis himself, who feels an uneasy presence within the car. The car is named Christine, and as Christine's appearances improves, so does Arnie's - he slicks his hair, wears cooler clothes, and is generally more confidant and cocky. But when Arnie starts the date the school's hot newcomer, Leigh (Alxandra Paul), the car is thrown into a bloodthirsty fit of jealousy.Made on the back of a hot streak that helped turn John Carpenter into a horror icon, Christine is a relatively minor work by his early standards, but is still infused with Carpenter's sense of style and atmosphere. Based on the novel by Stephen King, which went to lengths to explain Christine's psychopathic behaviour, the film instead establishes the red hunk of auto-porn as evil from the get- go as it kills someone before it's even off the assembly line. Perhaps trying to explain why a car was killing people in cold blood and how it possesses the ability to repair itself would somewhat remove the façade, choosing (or hoping) instead to let the audience simply enjoy the movie without the need for clunky exposition. And it works - Carpenter has it play out with a straight face and the film is very enjoyable for the majority of its 100 minute running- time.The film takes time to develop its story and a supporting cast that includes Harry Dean Stanton, Robert Prosky and Roberts Blossom helps things move along nicely. When heads begin to roll, Carpenter delivers a couple of visually arresting set-pieces involving an attack on some bullies at a gas station and the chasing-down of a fat kid, both of which see Christine attack her sweetheart's aggressors with all the grace of a bull in a china shop. There's only so much you can do when your killer is a car, and it naturally takes a lot of bone-head's to let themselves be killed by it. No-one seems to move sideways, run up some stairs or enter a building (unless it's a flimsy gas station). But Christine does manage to somehow take on a personality of its own, and there's always something oddly satisfying about watching metal scrape, crash or burn on screen. It pales in comparison to the likes of Escape from New York and The Thing, which came the two years before, but Christine is a perfectly well-executed horror.

Mostly his victims are the rich and successful, although one young couple befriends him, which ends in the death of the young man from suicide. In all cases, Smith's liaisons are designed to make him money. But later in the film you begin to realize he's not just a con artist; he's a deeply needy young man who lives in sort of a fantasy world. He wants all the good things in life, but only really sees his way free to get those things through hustling.However, it's not just Smith's performance that stands out here. The primary couple that he befriends are brilliantly played by Donald Sutherland and Stockard Channing (certainly her best role). They're a totally absorbed rich couple who have no sense of realism beyond their own art-filled world of the rich.Supporting roles are played by Ian McKellen (who coincidentally has one line where he mentions The Lord Of The Rings nearly a decade before that film series was filmed), Bruce Davison, and Richard Masur.

Slap Shot also has another plus The Hanson Brothers, savages, who join Reggie's team. They also brought their little toy cars, and train set, which I guess, really makes them unique. The only guy, not for the dirty play is Newman's second man, Braden (Ontkeon, who's cheating on his average looker of a wife (Crouse, who's so entertaining, thanks to her anger) We have an older randy player, who likes to ramble on with old tales, as well as some ethnic players, one not really getting the character exposure he should of, while the other one, opens the movie, in what you could say, is a funny and hurtful interview. Why I like this film so much, to me is an enigma. I guess partly, it's because the players really get bloody, where the blood looks real, but too, like I said at the beginning, a lot of thanks, goes to the screenplay. We have two young female fans, in matching attire with matching hooters. One scene has Newman, going off at a would be female representative, who folds, as she can make more money the other way, thus making Newman spout an unsavory remark, firily, about the woman's little boy.

I love the battle scenes, betrayal, and the special effects of this episode. Many of the planets amaze me because of their stunning realism. Anyways, Star Wars Episode V The Empire Strikes Back is the best movie ever made!

Having endured terrible Jaws ripoffs such as Tentacles and Devilfish, I expected very little from this film in terms of quality, but was gladly mistaken. This is a film that takes into account the potential similarities to Jaws and takes every opportunity to differentiate itself rather than delve into parody. Instead of upper class suburban New York we have downtrodden Chicago slums, and of course the titular crocodilian in place of a shark. Without spoiling any details, I can't point out much else. However, to anyone who may have passed on this film due to potential similarities to a certain popular Spielberg film, give it a watch. You will not be disappointed.
