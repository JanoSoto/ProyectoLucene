Twelve Monkeys is a clever, well thought out movie and has many hits and punches to it. However, with every punch, comes with a bruise. It's funny how it's so much easier for me to write about the things I didn't like about the movie as opposed to the things I did like about it.Let me first try the things I did like. Twelve Monkeys took me through a sort of sci-fi-e story about a guy named James Cole (Bruce Willis), who is sent back in time by the head counsel to bring back the source of a monkey disease that kills most of the population by 1996. I'm guessing because he has a really good memory and some decent fighting skills they found he was best suited for the job. What really got interesting is when I started asking myself how would I handle James's situation by trying to explain to the people in the past that they are all going to be wiped out. It's hard to say if I would have done a better job than he did, and I would like to think that of course. The best thing about Twelve Monkeys is that it always keeps you in the dark, until it all unravels in the very end. If a movie can keep my attention throughout then I say it is worth recommending.Finally, here are the problems I had. First off, I'm going to flat out say that I hate having famous actors in films. For me it kills the whole atmosphere because when you try to imagine a famous actor playing a certain character, it's hard to do that when you have seen that same person in dozens of other films. Anyway, the whole thing about going back in time kinda threw me for a loop, because it just seemed so out of place. Had they have made the past a little bit later and made the future look more futuristic, then maybe they could have pulled it off better. One thing that annoyed me is that it took the characters to the very end to find out that a tall, white, completely bald guy can stick out in a crowd, and it'd probably be best to give him a hat.So to conclude it, I am going to recommend Twelve Monkeys for those who like time traveling sci-fi-ish movies with famous actors.

I suppose that it does have a lot of explosions and gunfire and dying, but I have always thought of action movies as ones where the action is.. glorified, if not glorious. When an explosion happens, there should be someone flying through the air in a tuxedo, when buildings fall down someone should be yelling SHIIIIIT! and when people die it should be after they've choked out their dying threat or quip. This movie's explosions and gunfire just make people fall down and die, and it's always expressed how much they don't want to, and often what it does to the psyche of the person who did the exploding or gunfiring.I'm not American and I wasn't alive in 1984, so there might well be a lot of contextual meaning that I missed. I don't particularly like war movies as a genre, because I can imagine well enough for myself that it's horrible. Setting the movie in a fictional war made me keep watching because I didn't know what the outcome would be. There was also enough personal story to keep me watching to find out how the characters, as well as the war, would go.They fought here alone; and gave up their lives, so that this nation shall not perish from the earth.I did wonder, several times, is it really worth all that? The kids just kept killing people, and more people got killed because of that, and by the end most of the Wolverines were dead too. To keep America America. Now I missed the start so I don't know if the invading forces were planning to do terrible things with the country. But I could not see that the idea of america was worth all of the violent deaths that I saw in this movie. I also didn't want to write off the story that the Wolverines had lived through. So I thought again, and now I wonder if maybe the idea of many differently-ideal-ed nations are necessary, and that it is worth death-fighting to keep a variety of governments in the world.I suppose fighting for ideals rather than lives is one of those great heroic issues. I find it a bit interesting that a movie whose characters really don't seem to know (or address) what purpose on earth they're fighting for seems to end up having that message of nationality.Actually, scratch that. They DO address that question. Patrick Swayze's character shouts (at the execution of the Russian and the turncoat) THEY DON'T LIVE HERE, or something similar. The instinct of you're on me, get off is the strongest motivation for partisan fighting on offer in this movie. That it's expressed in so few words and with such simplicity, and that there's no treatise on American ideals spoken or read, makes the ending rather hollow to me now. It leaves this nation as not a people unified under whatever bill or constitution or dream it is that's supposed to make America American, but as a load of people who just happen to be there, who've been there for some time, and don't want no- one on their land, y'hear? And that is unfortunate, seeing as how modern America has the history that it does. It maybe also makes the story as a whole more understandable and relatable.I did find Red Dawn rather watchable.

An intriguing and sometimes poetic excursion. After Stanley Kubrick's death, it was inevitable that A.I. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, his long-planned project with Steven Spielberg, will not be made the same way it might have been. But that's alright, as Spielberg follows Kubrick's footsteps very closely, as if the man as still there behind the stage. At times, Spielberg actually gives us the feeling of being in one of Kubrick's own films. Sure, the film still makes room for some lukewarm Spielberg sap, but other than that, this is Spielberg's deepest, darkest film to date, one that ventures deeper in the world he only explored (and succeeded) on E.T. THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL.Although the relationship between A.I and E.T. are comparable, the two films are actually very much unlike each other. Once again, Spielberg ventures into our most cherished imaginings and turns them into mind-tricking reality. The special effects here are wonderful of course (what isn't if you work with the guys at ILM), but more wonderful is how imaginative and innovative they are. This is the Spielberg charm, a special effects machine with heart. A movie that makes us wonder, delight, question, captivate and focus on while not denying us the pleasures of the latest in special effects technology. Instead of a the typical flash-and-bang products, Spielberg honors Kubrick by giving us sights for which we can ponder and absorb all its wonders; pretty much what Kubrick's Monoliths did for 2001. The special effect here are stunning (remember seeing REAL dinosaurs in JURASSIC PARK for the first time?), but Spielberg doesn't waste the wonder by providing a cohesive story and an imaginative direction to go along with his visual eye candy. But this isn't just some story about a boy robot, or his adventures in trying to please his foster human parents. The story is based on a work by Brian Aldiss called Summer Toys Last all Summer Long, a project toyed with by Stanley Kubrick for many years. Through these many years, Spielberg gives a welcome helping hand during development. Up until Kubrick's untimely death, the film was developed nearly enough, but it still wasn't a film. Spielberg doesn't deny us the work they've done so far. He provides us a story that captivates even as a far-from-perfection film. A.I. is not without its flaws of course. The pacing takes nearly forever to get going, and some of the pure Spielberg sappiness is undeniably present. But in the end, it is Spielberg himself who makes A.I. a terrific motion picture of the sci-fi mold. The film takes place somewhere in a not-so-distant (by today's standards) future, where Global Warming has flooded many of the world's major cities. In place of a lessening population, scientists resolves to Mechas, near-human machines that'll make cyborgs look like the Tin Man. Haley Joel Osment, after his sweeping performance in THE SIXTH SENSE already made him a star, plays a new model Mecha designed by the successful CEO\/visionary (William Hurt) who is programmed to do what machines can't do Fall in love with a parent, and in turn be loved back.Frances O'Conner and Sam Robards play the foster parents of David, substituting him temporarily for their son (Jake Thomas), under a coma, who pretty soon snaps out of his coma and has a little brotherly competition with his would-be Mecha brother. When life gets too tough, he is soon asked to be destroyed. Feeling sympathy for the little boy (robot), his (foster) mother instead sets him out to the open world, alongside him only his walking, talking teddy bear and high hopes that he meets with the Blue Fairy, the fairy from his Pinocchio stories which he believes will grant him the wish of becoming a real boy so that his mother will love him more. Jude law co-stars as a playboy gigolo Mecha named Gigolo Joe who aids David's side (mainly because he has digs on this Blue Fairy). By the time the film reaches its second act, the audience would have been divided between those who would stick to it or walk out. Although A.I. is wonderful piece of work; an artful ode to the ponderous storytelling talents of Stanley Kubrick done best since Kubrick himself DID partly make this film, it ain't a film for everyone. It's wondrous, intriguing, admittedly flawed, but vast and gripping. Anyone expecting a film that takes its premise easily may find the film a bit to dark and sober. But this is just what Kubrick wants it to be, and being like a student of a master that he still is, Spielberg couldn't agree more. A.I. may have been a film that could be passed on from one great director to another, but there could be no other way to tell it. What a wonderful and underrated film! Rating ***** out of 5.

But this is just what Kubrick wants it to be, and being like a student of a master that he still is, Spielberg couldn't agree more. A.I. may have been a film that could be passed on from one great director to another, but there could be no other way to tell it. What a wonderful and underrated film! Rating ***** out of 5.

Since then, I devoted myself to seeing the following two films on the first day of release -- a promise I kept.Peter Jackson's take on Tolkien's fantasy masterpiece not only carries a great deal of the text to full film fruition, but shows the power of film, and proving that nothing is impossible. Jackson's vision is continuous, and never seems to loose grasp of the story that is being told. Using the artistry of John Howe and Alan Lee, The Fellowship of the Ring gleams with a beautiful and dark atmosphere, a length of detail that makes it seem like everyone and everything has its own history, and full of wondrous images one could never imagine.The acting is superb. With a complex script, each actor has transformed these characters into 3-D people with deep back-story, and people that we feel compassion for. This is one extraordinary ensemble cast. Each actor IS that character, making it seem impossible to imagine anyone else fill that person's shoe in their stead. Viggo Mortensen IS Aragorn. Sir Ian McKellen IS Gandalf the Grey. Elijah Wood IS Frodo Baggins. One could weep with our heroes should one fall, or feel inspired when they achieve victory. A fantasy with this much emotion just seems surreal, but it's completely believable.Never losing pace, the writing and direction is flawless, making for one enthralling introduction into Middle-earth. The voice over prologue fills even the most uneducated audience member with all the necessary knowledge they need to know in order to understand our heroes' and villains' motives. Some things of course have been omitted for pacing reasons. While not present in the theatrical cut, we do see the passing of the Grey Elves, and get a brief tale of Beren and Luthien. The barrow-wights and their story is no where to be seen (as interesting as it is in the book, there really is no place for it in this film) and Tom Bombadil is absent as well, but thankfully to the ingeniousness of the writers, in the Extended Edition of The Two Towers a little homage is paid to the character. Omissions and changes are always part of adapting a book to film, and the ones made by Peter Jackson, Phillipa Boyens and Fran Walsh are justifiable in every way.The action scenes are spaced out thoroughly enough for breathing room, plot advancement, and ever-continuing character development. Each action scene is its own, be it the flight to the Fjords of Bruinen, the Mines of Moria, or the showdown at Amon Hen near the end of the film. All are greatly choreographed, each stunt member and actor is full of energy and ambition as they wield deadly weapons at each others' heads and limbs. It really is a sight to behold.The special effects are mesmerizing. The use of CGI, miniatures\/bigatures, and even clever camera angles blend to make one ideal image after the other. The soaring images of Barad-dur or Orthanc seem real when in fact, they only stand so many feet high. The Argonath, two figures of enormous height standing before the Anduin River seem like 300 foot creations, when in fact they are about only several feet off the ground. Simply jaw-dropping imagery.Howard Shore's score for The Fellowship of the Ring is a beautiful, epic, and complex piece of work that makes one feel like they have been entranced. Even when some of the text seems omitted from the screen, it can be heard through the powerful instrumentation conducted and created by this composer. The use of leitmotifs to symbolize a country, race, or character is stunning.Overall, The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring is a visionary masterpiece, allowing the world to see what seems like actual history with fantastic elements, equaling the greatness of Hollywood's earlier classics. As the first of three, one who has not seen these films can await the next several hours of their lives to be changed for ever.

Rocky meanwhile meets up with a young boxer named Tommy Gunn whom wants Rocky to manage him but Rocky decides he is not a good enough listener. He latter changes his mind and agrees to train Tommy Gunn and begins to spend more time with Tommy than his own son and dissension soon forms between father and son.TOmmy Gunn moves up the ranks. George Washington meanwhile tries to lure Gunn away from Rocky by lavishing wealth and women upon him. Rocky Jr. beats up the bullies that bugged him. Gunn leaves Rocky and immediately battles Union Caine for the heavyweight champion title and wins it. Rocky and Jr. talk and patch things up. After winning the title Gunn is hassled by reporters who argue that him winning the belt is meaningless since he never beat Rocky to obtain it and because Caine was a paper champion.Gunn finds Rocky at a local Bar and challenges him but Rocky says no. Paulie then taunts Gunn but gets beaten up. Rocky then agrees to fight Gunn in the streets. Getting some support from the Spirit of Mickey, Rocky beats Gunn up.The whole concept of Rocky losing everything he got and starting off again where he started from is pretty stupid. Also the way he lost all of his money is really ignorant. And since Paulie is supposedly the reason for them losing so much they STILL LET HIM LIVE WITH THEM!!!! Tommy Gunn is a pretty lame character. ALso a Rocky Movie with no big fight in the ring at the end is a bad idea. Rocky fighting Gunn in the ring at the end would have made this movie a little better, not much, but I guess that idea was not good.If you are a fan of the Rocky movies stay away from this one. I got the box set of Rocky from my sister for Christmas one year but I never watch this one. FOr me Rocky five never happened.

It's truly a puzzle. I doubt any two movies could be more different than Reds and Shampoo and yet they have this in common they're rather dull watching. To Shampoo you must add the adjectives pointless and purposeless although, admittedly, I liked it more than I liked Reds - which isn't really much of a compliment! In Shampoo Beatty casts himself as hairdresser George Roundy. George is completely self-absorbed and hedonistic, admitting at one point that the only reason he became a hairdresser was because of all the beautiful women he figured he'd get to sleep with. He juggles relationships and seems to have no real commitment to anyone but himself. (Perhaps producer Beatty was making an unconscious autobiographical comment?) The problem is that it's just not consistently funny. There are a few scenes, yes, but not enough to make this work, and in the end the movie doesn't seem to go anywhere. I can live with pointless and purposeless movies, because often it's the very pointlessness that makes a comedy funny - you're not to take it seriously; you're just to laugh. I didn't really laugh at this movie, and, in fact, I think Beatty wants us to take something seriously here, but I'm not sure what. I'm also not sure what having the 1968 presidential election win of the Nixon\/Agnew ticket as the backdrop had to do with the movie, either.What did this movie have going for it? Well, Goldie Hawn. She was pretty good, and stunning in that micro-mini she wore. The other women in George's life (played by Julie Christie and Lee Grant) were also well portrayed. Perhaps the best performance of the movie, though, was from Jack Warden as Lester Carp. In the end, though, what I liked best about a movie that I didn't like much was that two of George's women finally told him to get lost - which they should have done a long time before.

But seeing as Hollywood apparently ran out of original ideas some time ago, the never-ending trend of revisiting the small screen means that I have a chance to get a feeling of what these shows may have been like. But are these faithful reproductions accurate or simply lazy film-making with a knowing wink at the fan boy audience? In case the show passed you by, Charlie's Angels is about a team of three sexy, sassy ladies working undercover as crime-fighting detectives. Natalie (Cameron Diaz) is the party-loving blonde one, Dylan (co-producer Drew Barrymore) is the wild-child brunette and Alex (Lucy Liu) is the cold-fish black haired Asian chick. Sorry if that sounds sexist but that's just the way it is and certainly their mysterious boss Charlie and his assistant Bosley (Bill Murray) have no complaints. The case they're working on is the kidnapping of IT boss Eric Knox (Sam Rockwell) and the theft of his top-secret voice recognition software but as the girls preen, karate-kick and flick their hair towards solving the case, it appears that the Angels themselves face a threat none of them ever expected.Never the most ground-breaking of shows, Charlie's Angels still has a strong cult following which gives some clues into how well loved the original TV show was. But this candy-floss light tribute will surely strain the patience of the most ardent of fans. Feeling like a bizarre spin-off of The Matrix (even showing us slo-mo bullets spinning in flight) doesn't do the movie any favours - such gimmickry was already becoming old-hat by the time this movie was released - and the insistence of using kung-fu feels quite silly when Diaz's giant frame drifts across the screen like someone throwing a stick. The blame is solely Barrymore's - her influence as producer meant that this was the way it had to be but she can't be blamed for the sub-standard acting. All three Angels are little more than cardboard cut-out stereotypes but Murray and Rockwell also struggle to make any impact. But the worst performer by a mile is Barrymore's then-squeeze Tom Green as Chad. Devoid of genuine humour, charm or point, he made my head hurt simply by speaking!Harsh words but taken for what it is, Charlie's Angels is still a mildly enjoyable movie despite the near-endless list of faults. The story makes a surprising twist halfway through and it is kinda fun if you switch your brain off. But like I said, I have no recollection of the original to compare this to and judging by the lack of enthusiasm on IMDb, it seems that even actual fans find this chick-friendly rehash a little tiresome. Yes, it might be faithful to the original but what's the point when the original was flawed to begin with? These remakes need something more to update them than simply changing the cast - look at the recent Bewitched movie as proof, a film so bad I'd rather be turned into a newt than watch it again. This is much better than that but if nothing else, at least you can watch three beautiful women on screen being as provocative as they dare. But if you're looking for a gripping, exciting, twisting spy thriller than go watch the Jason Bourne movies.

I was never bored. I certainly wish there was less swearing and that the 'almost love scene' was left out, so that I could sit down and watch this with my kids.John Travolta and Kirsty Ally are both completely lovable in their roles. Although the movie fails to take me through their more rough emotions with them. I don't feel for her when her baby's daddy doesn't follow through with his fatherly responsibilities. And I don't really feel for him over his unfulfilled (at least temporarily) love.I guess that is what makes this film so fun though. You are not brought down so you can just focus on the fun and uplifting parts without your mind dwelling on the trials of the characters.I highly recommend this film to anybody who won't get hung up on the little things (and I think that's most people). So, go rent it. It may be old for a film, but it hasn't lost any of it's sparkle. Enjoy.

At the start of the film they are awakened from hyper-sleep and are surprised that they aren't back at Earth as planned but in a strange system where they have intercepted a possible distress beacon's message. When they investigate they find a strange alien ship that appears to have been there a very long time, the pilot has fused to his chair and his ribs are broken in a way that suggests he was killed from the inside.As they continue to explore the ship Kane (John Hurt) discovers a room full of strange leathery pods, when he touches one it opens and a strange creature jumps out, burns its way through his helmet and clamps itself onto his face. Back on the shuttle they attempt cut it off only to discover that the creature bleeds an acid so strong that a few drops burn through several of the ship's decks. After a while the creature detaches itself and dies for no apparent reason. When Kane awakes he is very hungry and wants a good meal before they go back in to hyper-sleep for the return home. During this meal the alien makes its dramatic appearance as it bursts out of Kane's stomach to the shock of his colleagues. The rest of the film follows their attempts to kill the alien which for some reason one of the crew appears to be protecting.Unlike most other science fiction films of its time Alien doesn't feature a spaceship with gleaming white surfaces instead it is a dirty claustrophobic vessel which is clearly a work horse and far from new, another difference with other such films is that the hero of the story is actually a heroine in the form of Ellen Ripley played by the excellent Sigourney Weaver in her first major role. The rest of the cast are also great as is the design of the alien, by only showing bits of it at a time it never looks like a man in a suits so remains terrifying till the end.If you've yet to see this film and like horror or sci-fi I strongly recommend that you give it a go.

When we saw Alien i was a student in England in my teens. People were leaving the theaters scared to death!!!We never had a similar experience in the past. It was the scariest movie we have seeing up to that time. It's being copied ever since thousand of times, but never surpassed even by Aliens, which also is a very good movie, an action thriller and not a sci-fi as this original. The creature is also the meanest, ugliest, scariest and perfect alien ever designed. It is the perfect killing machine, and this what makes the film so interesting. The humans are helpless when confronting it, and although technology has advanced they are still very weak compared to it. I think that if there is a moral issue coming from Alien is that we have to be humble no matter how much we advance scientifically. Alien is the punishment for our arrogance, an arrogance which is obvious in the early stages of the movie. I would give it a 9.
