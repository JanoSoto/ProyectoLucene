The title of this movie based on an autobiographical novel set in the 'Seventies turns out to be truer than one would ever have imagined. There is this contrast between the innocence of 'Seventies Catholic school students and the heavy stuff that happens to them.  But these disasters all take place outside the church and parochial school that loom over the young boys and girls glimpsed in `Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys.'Somehow I'd gotten the naïve impression that this movie would be lighthearted fun.  Instead, I left somewhat shaken and rather disconcerted because some pretty serious emotions were aroused - without being fully dealt with. Young Francis' life - not unusual for an adolescent boy - is pretty much a non-stop downer even when he gets the girl of his dreams. There are few payoffs and few laughs and the ending is tragic.The movie nonetheless has its own discreet charms.  The dialogue is impressively real from the very first.  These kids don't talk like adults or like hip John Hughes cuties; they talk like what they're supposed to be fourteen-year-olds. When the four boys get together to plan a comic strip or a prank, magic doesn't necessarily happen.  I liked the fact that the filmmakers were willing to let events be as anticlimactic as real boys' lives usually are. And the whole conception of a band of young troublemakers in eighth grade and their outrageous projects to get revenge against a nun who has seized their self-created comic book is a delightful one.On the other hand, the story doesn't exactly show kids just confronting everyday kid stuff. When young Francis Doyle (Emile Hirsch) gets close to his girlfriend, she reveals an ugly secret far more extreme than anything most kids would ever have to deal with, and what happens to Francis' best friend is a romantic-tragic fantasy of still greater extremes, something that really requires a whole other movie, not just a quick finale. In neither case does the film thoroughly process the issues it has raised.  I wanted to go back and reread S.E. Hinton to see kids' serious problems confronted and dealt with in a mature but youth-friendly way.  Perhaps because of the Catholic milieu, events are framed in overly lurid colors. True, these are nicely absorbed into the imaginary Todd McFarlane animations that grow out of the boys' project to conceive a trinity of supermen based on themselves.  This animated element is an original touch, one that, in theory anyway, parallels the overactive imaginations and busy hormones of young boys - but it's an idea that's not worked out in complete enough detail. I was intrigued by the way the good and evil figures of the animations somehow also fit into the references to William Blake and his `Marriage of Heaven and Hell' - there's some thoughtful writing lying behind the screenplay - but ultimately the animations neither develop completely enough on their own nor parallel the actual events closely enough to provide commentary. Interesting though they are, they seem a bit tacked on, and in fact they were added late in the making of the movie.  We're talking about serious structural flaws, here.On the other hand, Emile Hirsch and Jena Malone, as the principal boy and his girlfriend, both give fine quiet performances without a wrong note. Their lovemaking scenes are sweet and touching and surprisingly intimate for fourteen-year-olds (what would the Legion of Decency say?). Kieran Culkin has presence and intensity as Francis' best friend Tim.  The other boys are not as well differentiated as the minor characters are in `Stand by Me' or `L.I.E.' or `The Virgin Suicides,' though, and while Vincent d'Onofrio and Jodie Foster are smooth and competent, they add nothing remarkable to the movie.  Foster (Sister Assumpta) in particular is disappointing, providing a kind of one-note intensity and no subtlety at all.  It's true that she has wooden material to deal with, playing a classic repressive nun with little to do but snap at the boys and punish them; somehow the screenplay doesn't give her enough real substance.  Nevertheless, there is a whole world of menace and kinkiness behind even the most generic idea of a repressive nun that Foster could have tapped but didn't. Her performance is pushed. D'Onofrio is a pleasant kind of foil, the easy-going, unpretentious priest - but this is surprisingly uninteresting work from an actor of of D'Onofrio's originality and talent.  Why, by the way, are there just one priest and one nun?  And why do we learn almost nothing about Francis and Tim's families? First time director Britisher Peter Care deserves credit for nowhere giving away his music video background, and seeing the movie has made me want to read the late Chris Fuhrman's book.  But I went away disturbed, not enthralled.

Unfortunately, it doesn't help prevent the murders.  Unbelievably, he falls in love with the prostitute at the head of the group seemingly on the Ripper's slash list  Mary Kelly (Graham).

Unfortunately, the more you know about the period of the Ripper, the less - proportionally - you will like about this film.  For starters, the theory at the heart of the plot has almost universally been either discretited or, at the very least, presented as unrectifiably flawed.  Secondly, Abberline's penchant for narcotics is (and always has been) highly debatable.  A difficult point to reconcile oneself with when it forms a rock-solid tenet of the movie's story.

Even though this movie pokes fun at those generic clichés, however, its message is more real than those assumptions and beliefs.Reese Witherspoon plays Elle Woods, a bubble and witty sorority sister originating from the sunny California. She fits in perfectly with her sisters, due to the fact it's perfectly clear that they all spend the same amount of time on their hair and nails as she does. But when it comes time for Elle to leave her girls and roots in pursuit to follow what she believes to be the love of her life all the way to Harvard Law School, one might think she would have to do some serious readjusting. But in actuality, Elle makes the transition a breeze. She wows the admissions committee at Harvard, thanks to her extremely clever admissions video where she lays in a pool in a sequined bikini and convinces them that she would make a perfect lawyer. And, to surprise everyone she knows, SHE GETS IN! This is where the only downfall of this movie comes in. Maybe this storyline might be a little predictable with plot twists that aren't so tricky, but in the context this fun and cute story, this works just fine. When she arrives at Harvard, Elle becomes the center of attention. Her pink pleather suit, Porsche convertible, spiky rhinestone heels and bouncy blonde hair don't exactly fit in with the argyle socks and sweater vests that the Harvard Law Students choose to sport. Unfortunately, these differences don't bring Elle the attention she wants.

To add to the mix there's the prison's racist father, and the son with whom he shares a poor relationship. The man in question is Hank Grotowski (Billy Bob Thornton) and the woman he falls for is Leticia (Halle Berry). To add to the apparent melodrama possibilities Leticia has an obese son whom she mistreats, paralleling Hank's treatment of Sonny (Heath Ledger). However it's how all these plot elements are handled that makes `Monster's Ball' stand out from the rut of emotional and racial drama.Firstly the acting in this movie is outstanding. I've always been a fan of Billy Bob Thornton's abilities and this movie is no exception - his taciturn, stoic nature plays beautifully into the role of Hank, a man used to repressing his emotions under the harsh rule of his father (with whom he still lives). His whole life and views aren't shaped by his own experiences, but that which he was taught. Thus we get to see the juxtaposition between the repressed Hank, and the Hank who finds love with a woman. Some people find this turnaround jarring but I can't say it is so - the racism instilled in him was never so much deep rooted, as failed to be examined. Thornton's ability to play a try, reserved man, with the undercurrent of emotion, is great to hold as is the obvious passion and love that's awakened by events in the movie. Then we cannot forget Halle Berry, who won an Oscar for her role - and I can't really complain about the choice. She's great in this. Rather than just be the poor wife, she's a character with edge, one that's more realistic. She's far from the perfect mother - alternating between abusive behaviour towards her son, and over protection. She's quite lost as events in the movie overwhelm her, and Berry's performance acutely captures this just as well as the tender realisation that there can be love in the world, when she falls for Hank. This love theme is dealt with quite splendidly because there's a great caution to it. The way it is handled, particularly at the end, is superb - as many other reviewers have pointed out.Obviously the movie is not without faults. Although the issue of racism, and the way the characters interact, is handled very well, the dialog can be a bit cumbersome and unwieldy at times. The direction too suffers from some flaws - camera shots that try to look `different' end up being distracting and seemingly pointlessly arty. Nevertheless the acting and other good aspects of the movie - an intelligent script, a haunting score, realistic rounded characters - make these passable flaws. This is not a light movie, replete with often shocking moments, but it is a powerful and unforgettable one. It's not quite a classic but it's very close. Well worth seeing. 8.5\/10.

What is good about it?  Nothing.  What is tediously, sometimes hilariously awful about it?  Everything.  This movie now ranks alongside Jurassic Park 2 and 1492 Conquest of Paradise as one of the worst films I have ever seen in a movie theater.  You may want to see it twice just to make sure it's really happening.I kept asking myself 'Why?' during the course of the movie, as in 'Why is any of this happening?', or 'Why do I care?', or 'Why don't I demand my money back?'  Why does Obi Wan not notice Fett's armor and jetpack (apparently) when they're right out in the open?  Why does Fett just decide after rappin' with Obi Wan to close the very open door?  What is the point of that scene?  Why is there the scene with C-3PO?  Why do we get to see this, and why would we want to?  None of these scenes have any importance!!!!The dialogue is right up there with Feeders, and the delivery is straight out of Lifeforce.  The whole die a little every day speech is supposed to be romantic?  Sure, when I like a girl, I always think about killing myself, or how it's so like dying.  Turns her on too.  They're not supposed to be together, so they very wisely decide to spend their time near fireplaces with mood music and revealing attire.  Sounds foolproof to me.I feel bad for Hayden.  He fluctuates between rampant underacting and rampant overacting, with a little 'acting' in between ('Obi Wan is like a dad to me...but I hate him...but he's like a dad...but I hate him' -- for TWO HOURS).  Which is SO much better than Natalie Portman, who Quaaluded out before every scene, spoke her lines, and then 'got tired' and had to lay down.

Get it at Amazon.)This is an American movie directed by Swedish born director Lasse Hallstrom (The Cider House Rules, 1999; Something to Talk About, 1995), set in France with a distinct French flavor. The cast, headed by the very talented Juliette Binoche as Vianne Rocher, a wandering proprietress of chocolate, is highly accomplished and very much worth watching. Judi Dench has a substantial role as the cranky Armande, and Johnny Depp makes a belated appearance as Binoche's love interest, Roux, the River Rat. Alfred Molina plays the small town's semi-fascist Catholic mayor, Comte Paul de Reynaud. With his slicked-back, straight black hair and the precise black mustache and his imposing countenance, one is somehow reminded of Count Dracula. Leslie Caron (An American in Paris, 1951; The L-Shaped Room, 1963), now in her seventies, has a small part as the widow Madame Audel. Carrie Anne-Moss of Matrix fame (but I recall her most memorably in Memento, 2000) plays Armande's strait-laced and estranged daughter. Noteworthy is the captivating Victoire Thivisol as Anouk Rocher, Vianne's nine-year-old daughter. Thivisol won the best actress award at the Venice Film Festival in 1996 for her work as a four-year-old (!) in Ponette (1996). She is surely the youngest actor ever to win such an award.Chocolat is also a kind of modern Dionysian morality tale in reverse with the Catholic church and small town narrow-mindedness as the bad guys. It gets more than a bit sappy at times, and the unrelenting celebration of outsiders and non-conformists is wearisome and sorely tried my patience throughout. However, just as is the case with chocolate with its uplifting qualities amidst the lure to overindulgence, the good surely outweighs the bad. Hallstrom is an ambitious director who is comfortable playing to an adult feminist audience. He attempts the complex and the unlikely. Here, there is more than the usual Hollywood seduction of the intended audience. There is underneath the surface a strong symbolic presence, giving the story a kind of resonating, fairy tale existence.Chocolate of course serves as the Dionysian wine, but it is also a semi-addictive substance from a tropical American plant, the cacao, rich in sumptuous oils and theobromine, a heart and general nervous system stimulant similar to caffeine. Cocoa was the first stimulant drink to break the unrelenting hold of beer and wine on the European palate. It was quickly followed by coffee and tea. Prior to the rise of these cerebral drinks, it was commonplace for Europeans to drink beer for breakfast, and indeed to drink beer and wine throughout the day. Many believe that caffeine was a handmaiden of the Renaissance, which of course led to the eventual weakening of the hold of the Roman Catholic church. Vianne, who is the daughter of a central American mother and a European father, represents the shamanism of the New World, leading the populace away from the narrow confines of the medieval mentality with her irresistible confections made with the seed of Theoboma cacao.The problem with the movie, and the reason it did not achieve a more wide-spread acclaim, lay not only with its cloyingly unbalanced feminist viewpoint and its anti-Catholicism, but with the difficulty Binoche (and Hallstrom) had with her complex role. Her character is a woman who wants desperately to find a place in society and to be accepted by the petite bourgeoisie while maintaining her personal sense of value (and her red shoes!). She is, in a sense, a gypsy fortune teller (recall the spinning plates) who longs to be a pillar of the community. She is worldly wise, kind and forgiving, but partly a shopkeeper with a shopkeeper's need to set down roots. She is also a Mayan princess born to wander with the sly wind that ushers her about. So, underneath all else, this is a story about finding a home. Because Vianne is frequently attacked for her lifestyle while being the sort of person who does not return insult with insult, Binoche is reduced in many scenes to a kind of tolerant, slightly superior, patient smile that becomes wearying. It is only when Johnny Depp appears that we see the real Juliette Binoche and a true indication of her ability. Incidentally Depp is excellent as a gypsy musician who understands himself and his place as a counter balance to a conservative society. He is an inspiration to Vianne because he alone is not transparent to her; she only discovers his favorite chocolate by happenstance after two wrong guesses. Depp also serves to save this film from the near monotony of inadequate males and dissatisfied females. When he appears I can almost hear the audience sigh.Incidentally, you might want to compare this to Babette's Feast (1987) in which the narrow-minded and in need of liberation are northern Protestants, while the woman with the tempting goodies is an exiled Catholic chef from France. If Hallstrom had taken a clue from Gabriel Axel, who directed Babette's Feast, and followed a more objective and balanced treatment, Chocolat might have been a great movie. As it is, it is a very interesting one, and one you're not likely to forget or to feel neutral about.

Noteworthy is the captivating Victoire Thivisol as Anouk Rocher, Vianne's nine-year-old daughter. Thivisol won the best actress award at the Venice Film Festival in 1996 for her work as a four-year-old (!) in Ponette (1996). She is surely the youngest actor ever to win such an award.Chocolat is also a kind of modern Dionysian morality tale in reverse with the Catholic church and small town narrow-mindedness as the bad guys. It gets more than a bit sappy at times, and the unrelenting celebration of outsiders and non-conformists is wearisome and sorely tried my patience throughout. However, just as is the case with chocolate with its uplifting qualities amidst the lure to overindulgence, the good surely outweighs the bad. Hallstrom is an ambitious director who is comfortable playing to an adult feminist audience. He attempts the complex and the unlikely. Here, there is more than the usual Hollywood seduction of the intended audience. There is underneath the surface a strong symbolic presence, giving the story a kind of resonating, fairy tale existence.Chocolate of course serves as the Dionysian wine, but it is also a semi-addictive substance from a tropical American plant, the cacao, rich in sumptuous oils and theobromine, a heart and general nervous system stimulant similar to caffeine. Cocoa was the first stimulant drink to break the unrelenting hold of beer and wine on the European palate. It was quickly followed by coffee and tea. Prior to the rise of these cerebral drinks, it was commonplace for Europeans to drink beer for breakfast, and indeed to drink beer and wine throughout the day. Many believe that caffeine was a handmaiden of the Renaissance, which of course led to the eventual weakening of the hold of the Roman Catholic church. Vianne, who is the daughter of a central American mother and a European father, represents the shamanism of the New World, leading the populace away from the narrow confines of the medieval mentality with her irresistible confections made with the seed of Theoboma cacao.The problem with the movie, and the reason it did not achieve a more wide-spread acclaim, lay not only with its cloyingly unbalanced feminist viewpoint and its anti-Catholicism, but with the difficulty Binoche (and Hallstrom) had with her complex role. Her character is a woman who wants desperately to find a place in society and to be accepted by the petite bourgeoisie while maintaining her personal sense of value (and her red shoes!). She is, in a sense, a gypsy fortune teller (recall the spinning plates) who longs to be a pillar of the community. She is worldly wise, kind and forgiving, but partly a shopkeeper with a shopkeeper's need to set down roots. She is also a Mayan princess born to wander with the sly wind that ushers her about. So, underneath all else, this is a story about finding a home. Because Vianne is frequently attacked for her lifestyle while being the sort of person who does not return insult with insult, Binoche is reduced in many scenes to a kind of tolerant, slightly superior, patient smile that becomes wearying. It is only when Johnny Depp appears that we see the real Juliette Binoche and a true indication of her ability. Incidentally Depp is excellent as a gypsy musician who understands himself and his place as a counter balance to a conservative society. He is an inspiration to Vianne because he alone is not transparent to her; she only discovers his favorite chocolate by happenstance after two wrong guesses. Depp also serves to save this film from the near monotony of inadequate males and dissatisfied females. When he appears I can almost hear the audience sigh.Incidentally, you might want to compare this to Babette's Feast (1987) in which the narrow-minded and in need of liberation are northern Protestants, while the woman with the tempting goodies is an exiled Catholic chef from France. If Hallstrom had taken a clue from Gabriel Axel, who directed Babette's Feast, and followed a more objective and balanced treatment, Chocolat might have been a great movie. As it is, it is a very interesting one, and one you're not likely to forget or to feel neutral about.

Get it at Amazon.)This is an American movie directed by Swedish born director Lasse Hallstrom (The Cider House Rules, 1999; Something to Talk About, 1995), set in France with a distinct French flavor. The cast, headed by the very talented Juliette Binoche as Vianne Rocher, a wandering proprietress of chocolate, is highly accomplished and very much worth watching. Judi Dench has a substantial role as the cranky Armande, and Johnny Depp makes a belated appearance as Binoche's love interest, Roux, the River Rat. Alfred Molina plays the small town's semi-fascist Catholic mayor, Comte Paul de Reynaud. With his slicked-back, straight black hair and the precise black mustache and his imposing countenance, one is somehow reminded of Count Dracula.

There are those that hold we all were just younger when the original trilogy was released and, as adults, are looking to feelings that cannot be achieved within the heart of an adult. Thus we view the new, prequel, trilogy as less substantial than the first. The other half of us says that, no, Lucas has lost sight of his original vision and has lost direction with the entire film making process.I, for one, am among the latter. But I arrived there after a personal struggle of epic proportions. I could not let myself believe that what was tantamount to my religion was becoming what Episodes I & II had become.What have they become? I will definitely say that they are unique films with amazing visual effects just in sheer amount. If films are like their auteur then they can be seen as a near perfect reflection of where George Lucas is in his life. A man who really doesn't understand the rest of the world. A man who has cut himself off from many sides of reality and can't seem to get back into touch with it. A man who doesn't know what young love feels like anymore. Most importantly a man who is obsessed with the technology of film making over the emotional psychology.Not that these things are necessarily wrong. People are who they are and the man is more comfortable than I could ever hope to be. But for the makings of a film this sets up a bad precedence.  Lucas' films are now devoid of life. They are windows to his soul. A soul that lives cut off from the realities of the world. As I've already reviewed The Phantom Menace I'll skip that and just move on to Attack of the Clones.I don't really know where to begin. Ewan Macgregor is charming as usual and I feel sorry for him in some ways. But in other ways I know his career is not in danger so hey Ewan, just sit back and have fun with it. Hayden Christensen is another story.  It's impossible to tell anything about his acting in the film because the dialogue is so horribly static and emotionless. But overall he's not who I pictured as Anakin, and the writing of his character has gotten out of hand. Darth Vader was a character we respected out of fear, Anakin Skywalker... we don't respect... we don't feel sorry for... really, we just don't care. He's a screw up and a jerk at that.Which brings us to Natalie Portman. Natalie, I think you're beautiful and a wonderful actress but these films don't show that. Amidala is cut out of an oak stump but at least she seems stable and in control... which is another problem. There is nothing in the script or film, which gives us any clue as to why this beautiful, strong, and smart woman would want to have anything to do with Anakin. She seems to fall in love with him simply because the script said so.Which brings me to the overall plot. There wasn't any. At least not as far as I could tell. Something about someone trying to unite some people against some other people for no real reason that I could see. If there is a reason I'm missing I think it could have been worked in a little better. I also didn't quite understand the battle at the end. Who were we fighting... who are we for that matter. There seemed to be no real reason for the battle other than George though there should be a battle.

And about the special effects.Allot has been said about the overall effects of the film and I do have to agree that they are staggering and plentiful. My problem is that nearly every second of screen time that computer-generated creatures and people had, was very painfully obvious. It may have had something to do with the digital film but it looked bad to me. Now just because a visual effect isn't convincing doesn't mean that the movie is a failure.

I also like Anne Bancroft, Kristen Scott-Thomas and James Fox, so selecting this movie from my video rental store was easy. Unfortunately, something must have happened in writing the screenplay.*** SPOILERS ***One of the more selfless and realistically portrayed acts of love I've ever seen takes place toward the end of this movie. James Fox's character reveals how very difficult and long a climb it has been to now be about to be appointed Governor of Bengal, one of the largest of India's states. With his sigh, his body movement, we sense the dedication, the diligence, the very effort it has taken to climb the greasy pole. Fox is not a peer - we sense no great hereditary estate. He has been knighted for his painstaking work and is apparently wealthy through his very industry.Fox is promptly informed by a poor widow to whom he has proposed, that during the very weekend she was to consider his proposal a) her view of charity was to sleep with a refugee (I thought I'd do him good -he was just so miserable is the amazing explanation), b) the refugee proceeded to kill himself with the gun Fox had lent her for protection, c) the widow arranged to hide the body in the woods with the assistance of a cad who despises Fox, d) Fox's gun and the cad were held by the police, but e) the widow managed to retrieve his gun and the cad by rifling through her friend's desk for material to blackmail the authorities. She tells Fox that she can understand if he would like to withdraw his proposal. Fox's reaction? Not only does he remain keen on marriage with her, but he would freely give up his career in doing so because he loves more than life, and the scandal (if revealed while he were Governor) of his wife's witless fornication causing a stranger's suicide would make the British government's task in India more difficult. To Fox's astonishing act of love, forgiveness and self-abnegation, the widow says she has never loved Fox, that his attitude is weak because they need him in India (one suspects she simply wishes to be the Governor's wife at that moment), that he misunderstands the cad who would never breathe a word of the scandal, and that she turns down his marriage proposal because the scandal has caused her somehow to become a woman of the world, rather than the child (you're used to giving me sweets) who wanted to marry him.However, as the widow, Scott-Thomas had seemed anything but a child. She had spoken before about the horror of marriage to one without virtue - about the twelve year long marriage she had endured in which her husband had gambled and drunk away their money, whored his way through countless women, and finally been killed while speeding. She had spoken of her dread of continuing to live on the generosity of strangers. These aren't a child's sentiments but an adult's sagacity.To whom then does Scott-Thomas turn after the selflessness of Fox's love? To whom does she turn to avoid the insecurity of which she spoke as the bane of her previous marriage? To a married man who says he can offer no guarantees of his love or faithfulness except that he will not return to his wife, who asks her to simply take the train to anywhere, and about whom we know only that he takes waitresses and servants frequently to bed, is disliked by the authorities, and assisted her to deceive the authorities to help her.At the end, she says to the cad, I was yours when you first sat down. Well, welcome to misery. Sorry, I know it's the movies, but when a movie ends this badly, with  the heroine choosing the charmless married void in lieu of the paragon of sacrificial love, security and virtue, I have a difficult time liking the movie. I found Sean Penn's character anything but likeable - he had a sort of neutered quality - making puerile fraternity boy jokes about sleeping with the 60+ old princess, asking why of a government official's decision in a crowded antechamber and shrugging weakly before sitting down (when asked if satisfied with the official's bogus explanation). I suspect the movie has taken the story's tragic ending and tried to torture it into a happy one. The same woman who presumably acted on impulse by marrying a weak man and suffered a disastrous marriage for it,the same woman who acted on impulse to seduce a poor refugee and thereby set in train the events that killed him, is indeed the woman who turns away from a man willing to throw away everything for which he worked out of love for her, for a man who says hey, no guarantees, babe. Tragedy will undoubtedly again ensue - the little painted grin painted on the protagonist as she heads toward the bar car, can't mask it.*** SPOILERS END ***I disliked the movie.

James Fox's character reveals how very difficult and long a climb it has been to now be about to be appointed Governor of Bengal, one of the largest of India's states. With his sigh, his body movement, we sense the dedication, the diligence, the very effort it has taken to climb the greasy pole. Fox is not a peer - we sense no great hereditary estate. He has been knighted for his painstaking work and is apparently wealthy through his very industry.Fox is promptly informed by a poor widow to whom he has proposed, that during the very weekend she was to consider his proposal a) her view of charity was to sleep with a refugee (I thought I'd do him good -he was just so miserable is the amazing explanation), b) the refugee proceeded to kill himself with the gun Fox had lent her for protection, c) the widow arranged to hide the body in the woods with the assistance of a cad who despises Fox, d) Fox's gun and the cad were held by the police, but e) the widow managed to retrieve his gun and the cad by rifling through her friend's desk for material to blackmail the authorities. She tells Fox that she can understand if he would like to withdraw his proposal. Fox's reaction? Not only does he remain keen on marriage with her, but he would freely give up his career in doing so because he loves more than life, and the scandal (if revealed while he were Governor) of his wife's witless fornication causing a stranger's suicide would make the British government's task in India more difficult. To Fox's astonishing act of love, forgiveness and self-abnegation, the widow says she has never loved Fox, that his attitude is weak because they need him in India (one suspects she simply wishes to be the Governor's wife at that moment), that he misunderstands the cad who would never breathe a word of the scandal, and that she turns down his marriage proposal because the scandal has caused her somehow to become a woman of the world, rather than the child (you're used to giving me sweets) who wanted to marry him.However, as the widow, Scott-Thomas had seemed anything but a child. She had spoken before about the horror of marriage to one without virtue - about the twelve year long marriage she had endured in which her husband had gambled and drunk away their money, whored his way through countless women, and finally been killed while speeding. She had spoken of her dread of continuing to live on the generosity of strangers. These aren't a child's sentiments but an adult's sagacity.To whom then does Scott-Thomas turn after the selflessness of Fox's love? To whom does she turn to avoid the insecurity of which she spoke as the bane of her previous marriage? To a married man who says he can offer no guarantees of his love or faithfulness except that he will not return to his wife, who asks her to simply take the train to anywhere, and about whom we know only that he takes waitresses and servants frequently to bed, is disliked by the authorities, and assisted her to deceive the authorities to help her.At the end, she says to the cad, I was yours when you first sat down. Well, welcome to misery. Sorry, I know it's the movies, but when a movie ends this badly, with  the heroine choosing the charmless married void in lieu of the paragon of sacrificial love, security and virtue, I have a difficult time liking the movie. I found Sean Penn's character anything but likeable - he had a sort of neutered quality - making puerile fraternity boy jokes about sleeping with the 60+ old princess, asking why of a government official's decision in a crowded antechamber and shrugging weakly before sitting down (when asked if satisfied with the official's bogus explanation). I suspect the movie has taken the story's tragic ending and tried to torture it into a happy one. The same woman who presumably acted on impulse by marrying a weak man and suffered a disastrous marriage for it,the same woman who acted on impulse to seduce a poor refugee and thereby set in train the events that killed him, is indeed the woman who turns away from a man willing to throw away everything for which he worked out of love for her, for a man who says hey, no guarantees, babe. Tragedy will undoubtedly again ensue - the little painted grin painted on the protagonist as she heads toward the bar car, can't mask it.*** SPOILERS END ***I disliked the movie.

Didn't think so. Does that make AOTC any good however? Well, yes it makes it (mildly) good and, certainly, entertaining and fun (if not a classic).First of all I got to look at the movie's flaw. Some of the dialog is just awful, in particular the romantic element. Mr. Lucas I know you're trying to create a tribute to classic serials but that doesn't mean you have to offer us ham-fisted interactions posturing as heart-felt conversations, does it? If people in your audience are laughing when they're supposed to be feeling the love in a scene, maybe you need to outsource your writing a bit more. Still as bad as the dialog is, it's bearable because I didn't actually expect anything better. The plot it's wrapped around is alright - there's some mutterings about clones, some treachery, a `twist', et cetera. It's not exactly `Memento' here but there's enough substance that your mind isn't left distracted because, after all, the plot's an excuse for the action pieces.It's the action here that lifts up AOTC. There's a lot more of it than its predecessor and it's more engaging. There's a great little asteroid scene, a big climatic-battle scene, lots of little fights, a `Chicken Run' homage, and a fair bit more. They're fun although they do lack some tension. One of the reasons is the foreknowledge of character's fates we have, seeing as this is a prequel trilogy. Another is the fact that, let's face it, Lucas is not a good director. Most noticeably this is seen in the wooden deliverances by virtually all the cast, all of whom are capable actors. He doesn't seem to be bothered trying to garner any performance out of them. Secondly his eye for a scene can sometimes be wonky - while the action is fun, and good visual candy, there's a definite lack of tension in them. The camera work and editing never help build a sense of palpable danger, which elevates action from enjoyable to exciting. Then there's his use of cheesy gimmicks (such as transitional wipes) - yes, yes, they're part of the mythos or whatever - that doesn't mean they're effective or good. In fact much could be slammed of Lucas' work here so I'll merely say that it's. alright and leave it at that. If it weren't for the fact that he's got a great army of SFX guys behind him it'd be more noticeable.It's the technical aspects, such as costume design, SFX and sound editing that help lull you into the movie, ignoring its many faults. The look of the movie is generally gorgeous - the digitalised Yoda is the most realistic computer animated character I have yet seen. The costumes are lush and fantastic, with the set pieces sweeping - perfect for a big screen. The sound on it is generally extra sharp, perhaps due to it's digital roots, and noticeable in the action sequences although the score itself is a bit flat and uninspired, too much a re-hash of previous material.AOTC is a cinema and popcorn movie. For the brainless sci-fi \/ action genre it can hold itself up fairly proud (the last decent science fiction movie being `Pitch Black'). You won't remember much of this after leaving the cinema (it lacks any real hook) but it will do it's job in that you'll be more than satisfied enough to check out the final part in the trilogy when it gets released. 6.5\/10.
