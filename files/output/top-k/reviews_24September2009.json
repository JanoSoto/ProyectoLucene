The popular comic book character is brought to life and Sam Raimi brings it to life exceptionally well. The characters are now on the big screen just as they were in the comics, something fans will for sure enjoy. This movie takes the simple idea of the accidental superhero and it turns into something people of all ages will appreciate. The mild mannered Peter parker is played by Tobey Maguire who actually turned out to be a good choice. The rest of the cast is also well assembled, with James Franco, J.K. Simmons and Rosemary Harris.The drama is very well played and I believe audiences will enjoy watching Peter Parker's journey from ordinary nerd to a nerd with super powers. Cliff Robertson, playing Ben Parker, was great in this film and his death was a truly sad moment.Playing our villain is Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn, a.k.a. Green Goblin. It is here we first a lot of CGI being used for the action but it works very well. Spider-Man swinging through New York looks remarkable and the stunts are amazing. The Green Goblin suit is actually very different from the one seen in the TV shows and comic books themselves. It's very mechanical, looking much more like armor. It is a change that many like myself don't mind at all and other than that the villain remains the same, a psychotic terrorist. Plays the role of Spider-Man's enemy perfectly. The portrayal of the character's insanity is done just how it should've been. Danny Elfman is the composer and Spider-Man's theme sounds heroic most definitely. It seems he has a thing for hero films, starting since the original Batman back in 1989. Who would've guessed that Sam Raimi, the director of the Evil Dead films, would be able to make such a well made film. Sam Raimi, you did good.

That's why we sympathize with characters who are essentially evil. The story by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola is a brilliant conjuring act, inviting us to consider the Mafia entirely on its own terms. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) emerges as a sympathetic and even admirable character; during the entire film, this lifelong professional criminal does nothing of which we can really disapprove.During the movie we see not a single actual civilian victim of organized crime. No women trapped into prostitution. No lives wrecked by gambling. No victims of theft, fraud or protection rackets. The only police officer with a significant speaking role is corrupt.The story views the Mafia from the inside. That is its secret, its charm, its spell; in a way, it has shaped the public perception of the Mafia ever since. The real world is replaced by an authoritarian patriarchy where power and justice flow from the Godfather, and the only villains are traitors. There is one commandment, spoken by Michael (Al Pacino) ''Don't ever take sides against the family.'' It is significant that the first shot is inside a dark, shuttered room. It is the wedding day of Vito Corleone's daughter, and on such a day a Sicilian must grant any reasonable request. A man has come to ask for punishment for his daughter's rapist. Don Vito asks why he did not come to him immediately.''I went to the police, like a good American,'' the man says. The Godfather's reply will underpin the entire movie ''Why did you go to the police? Why didn't you come to me first? What have I ever done to make you treat me so disrespectfully? If you'd come to me in friendship, then this scum that ruined your daughter would be suffering this very day. And if, by chance, an honest man like yourself should make enemies . . . then they would become my enemies. And then they would fear you.'' As the day continues, there are two more scenes in the Godfather's darkened study, intercut with scenes from the wedding outside. By the end of the wedding sequence, most of the main characters will have been introduced, and we will know essential things about their personalities. It is a virtuoso stretch of film-making Coppola brings his large cast onstage so artfully that we are drawn at once into the Godfather's world.The screenplay of ''The Godfather'' follows no formulas except for the classic structure in which power passes between the generations. The writing is subtly constructed to set up events later in the film. Notice how the request by Johnny Fontane, the failing singer, pays off in the Hollywood scenes; how his tears set up the shocking moment when a mogul wakes up in bed with what is left of his racehorse. Notice how the undertaker is told ''someday, and that day may never come, I will ask a favor of you. . .'' and how when the day comes the favor is not violence (as in a conventional movie) but Don Vito's desire to spare his wife the sight of their son's maimed body. And notice how a woman's ''mistaken'' phone call sets up the trap in which Sonny (James Caan) is murdered It's done so neatly that you have to think back through the events to figure it out.

Lestat did not go to sleep in the 18th or 19th century and when he did he was still horribly wounded from being repeatedly stabbed, having his throat cut, being set on fire, and being thrown from a large tower. As I am a fan of the books this flick annoyed me so much I started shouting at the TV. As far as I know Lestat wasn't a fan of the goth genre. He was supposed to have risen in the 80s and was a ROCK star... not goth, not metal, not rap, but ROCK star, proper 80s rock. He wore denim and huge 80s sunglasses, rode a Harley Davison or a Porsche, which sadly got totalled but thats another story (that SHOULD have been in this movie). Thats the least of the flaws. As many here have stated, many characters and about 90% of the story and background has been cut out and probably sh*t on by the B-movie hacks responsible for this tripe. Even those characters that were wedged into the background were just nameless, funny looking freaks - i had to look up these people on the internet to find out who they were. The character of Armand looked more like Marius was supposed to look than the actual Marius character himself. AND, since when did Akasha have a semi Russian accent and an African heritage? The concert scene in the books was much more interesting than the awful spectacle in the movie. It was a nice touch that in a giant arena Lestat didn't need a microphone because of his powerful vampiric voice. Jesse was supposed to be severely injured at the concert too, having her spine smashed and it was Mael (the freaky old scarecrow guy in the movie) who turned her. Don't even get me started on the P!SS poor ending of this overzealous mtv ad because that was just a load of crapola!I'm gonna stop now because thinking about it is just angering up the blood.

Ava Gardner's character, in particular, is so unlikable and bitchy that it is almost over the top and unrealistic, pushing the envelope too far, so to speak.I must say that elevator sequence really frightened me when I first saw this move-very disturbing-, but I agree with other reviewers that the use of the fake blood splattered at the end of that scene is totally unnecessary. I'm sure we all know that if an elevator drops down from that height, that people are going to be injured or killed. Very tasteless.Mark Robson, the director, was actually a very well-known and professional director, going back partly to the golden age of Hollywood. Again, why would he sign on to be part of something like this. very puzzling to me, that's for sure.All in all, for the special effects this is mindless and harmless entertainment, but not anything close to good movie-making, to be sure.

Oh dear, I really don't know where to start with this awfully dull thriller. I managed to sit through all of it but for a fairly short film it dragged on and on for what seemed like an eternity and the only thing that I was really fearful of was that I might fall asleep with the TV on and waste money on my parents' electricity bill.With a thriller you are supposed to build up tension throughout the film and then release it all in a nail biting climax that leaves you gasping for breath and on the edge of your seat. It's a fairly simple idea, but Fear manages to botch it up royally.You are introduced to a fairly tedious rich family, apparently facing all sorts of problems, and then after about quarter of an hour of mindless bitching the daughter meets supposedly the perfect boyfriend. As the guy says himself if something seems too good to be true it probably isn't, meaning that he is obviously going to be a psycho. So much time is spent on them being loving together it doesn't really add anything to the plot except for making you want to throw up. One particular scene on a roller-coaster was particularly distasteful and quite disturbing for entirely the wrong reasons.The premise isn't actually that bad, they probably could have squeezed a decent movie out of it if they had really tried but they decide to ignore subtly and hit you in the face with the obvious. They could have let the boyfriend slowly display his psychotic side, flashing the audience hints that the girl doesn't notice, so our fear for her grows the more and more the relationship goes on. The more she doesn't know he's bloody mental and the more we do, the more we care. Instead they decide that he is going to display his mentalness right in front of her face by going ape-**** and attacking one of her buddies, all because the poor dude gave her a hug.After this the plot just gets more ludicrous and keeps going round in circles but somehow manages to get to a really promising climax. Just when I thought the film might just be able to redeem itself, the director manages to mess up the ending as well.

After many suicides and self wounding related to being alone with the children, a government scientist start suspecting something supernatural with the children. I don't want to ruin the fun so I'm gonna stop here and leave the rest for you.Like most john Carpenter films this is an exiting and creepy film, which keeps you interested at the end. Only problems were the middle section were a little slow, about ten minutes of the film was a little boring. but hey that's it, ten minutes. Also I must admit it did lack some of that humour often in Carpenter films, but i guess that wasn't supposed to be here after the children got into the picture, so i can't really complain about that.Simply said, this is not Carpenters best, but far from his worst. it keeps your attention going, it's very creepy, and the ending was very good. My verdict is 9\/10.

Perhaps it is the skill of the three famous names that star in this magnificent movie, Jack Lemon, Tony Curtis and Marilyn Monroe that makes it such compelling viewing , or the hilarious situations they find themselves in.

From the delightful Josephine (Tony Curtis) and the naughty Daphne (Jack Lemon) to the voluptuous Sugar (Marilyn) it is packed full of unexpected twists and turns. We wonder how complicated life can become for these two unlucky musicians Jo and Jerry, who, out of work and desperate, decide to 'become' women in order to get away from a group of gangsters who want to see them dead.

Sugar is happy to confide in her new girlfriends about the most personal issues, including her dreams of meeting a shy millionaire who wears glasses and owns a yacht. Much to Daphne's disgust, best friend Josephine becomes that retiring and innocent millionaire man of her dreams who pretends to own a yacht in order to entertain Sugar and allow her to concentrate on helping him overcome his shyness with women. You guessed it! This therapy comes in the form of teaching him to kiss. It helps greatly that he sounds like Cary Grant and is dressed in stolen yachting clothes even down to the spectacles.

With a few tight costume changes and near misses including hiding in a bubble bath, Jo just about keeps his double identity a secret.In the meantime, Daphne is being pursued herself, or should I say himself, by the real millionaire of the story; a rather small, old and unattractive man with round, dark rimmed spectacles desperate to find his eighth wife. It seems the more insulting and rejecting Daphne is to his advances, the more he wants her, not realising that Daphne is in fact Jerry. This is a brilliant contrast to the 'real' love that is developing between Josephine and Sugar or do I mean Joe or is that Maxamillion Junior? The hilarious double identities and storyline come to a climax when the gangsters catch up with the two new female jazz players and they find themselves hiding under tables, avoiding machine gunners jumping out of a huge birthday cake, and running for their lives.

Recently, a re-release of Forbidden Zone in colour was playing, and previously only having a poor VHS copy I had to see it in the theater, plus I wondered what the bizarre world would look like in full colour.Forbidden Zone is something like a cross between John Waters & Terry Gilliam. Bizarre, surreal visuals permeate the film, as do quirky, offensive gags involving bodily fluids you've never even seen, and probably didn't want to. Despite the gross out humour and low budget, Forbidden Zone is a treat for the eyes, you'll never see a movie quite like it visually. In a way, the low budget actually makes it unique and only lends to the humorous atmosphere. The films soundtrack is a great mix between Danny Elfman's band, The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo (Who have an appearance in the film) and classic 1930's tunes. So all in all, FZ looks and sounds great.The plot is relatively simple King Fausto and his Queen rule over The Sixth Dimension, a bizarre netherworld full of female slaves, fetishistic desires, and general chaotic insanity. The entrance to the Sixth Dimension lies in the basement of a house, the very house that the Hercules family moves into. The young daughter of the household, Frenchy (Because she's French, of course.) enters the Sixth Dimension through the door, and it only gets stranger from there. Exploding bald men speaking gibberish in jockstraps, frog butlers, Tattoo from fantasy island playing a horny king, and even Satan appear in the Sixth Dimension's bizarre plane.The film itself is absolutely hysterical. With all the strange sights on display, it uses them for some surprisingly funny shock humour, and even when the humour isn't in your face or easily visible or audible, you'll still be chuckling at the set design and strange quirks beneath the surface.If you consider yourself a fan of Midnight Movies, then why in the name of GOD haven't you seen this film? Go! Go now! Enter the Sixth Dimension, move in the wrong direction! Just see the damn movie!

Recently, a re-release of Forbidden Zone in colour was playing, and previously only having a poor VHS copy I had to see it in the theater, plus I wondered what the bizarre world would look like in full colour.Forbidden Zone is something like a cross between John Waters & Terry Gilliam. Bizarre, surreal visuals permeate the film, as do quirky, offensive gags involving bodily fluids you've never even seen, and probably didn't want to. Despite the gross out humour and low budget, Forbidden Zone is a treat for the eyes, you'll never see a movie quite like it visually.

It was a comedy but also could make you sad. With all that it also did a lot of good history background. I also think that Forrest Gump is a very inspirational movie for anyone. It showed that someone like Forrest Gump can show others what life is all about and also what is important in life. They mention and show many different historical events. One example is the Vietnam War and what things were like there. I think the thing I liked the most is how they made Forrest Gump the character show people that the little things in life are more important. Such examples are being a love and caring person towards your family and friends. I also think a message of keeping promises to the most important people in your life is showed through this morning. That is a very important message.
