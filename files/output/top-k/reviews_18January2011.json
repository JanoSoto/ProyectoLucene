Fight Club is my favourite movie of all time. The main point of this review is to get people to watch this film that has such deeper meaning than the title suggests.Consumerism has enslaved the modern man to 9 to 5 weekdays. That's the basic message, but what makes this film great is that after watching it time and time again, the message becomes more complex and well drawn out. In a way it's harder to put into words than the first time I ever saw it, because whether or not we are to agree with Tyler's point of view, or agree with how far he takes it, is really up in the air.It's not hard to imagine that a 9 to 5 office job running reports for a major car company's failure rates would cause insomnia when paired with the modern bachelor lifestyle. What's the point in having a fine line between waking and sleeping when your whole life is spent in a stupor? Our protagonist, Rupert\/Cornelius\/Travis\/Jack (his real name is never given) is looking to change his life, to re-define himself, and he's not a healthy person to begin with. His mental illness is evident not only in his insomnia but in his droning narration, his cynicism, and his addiction to self-help groups. Attending groups for testicular cancer, tuberculosis, blood parasites, you name it, helps Jack feel like someone is actually listening to him (because they think he's dying), helps him cry, and ultimately helps him sleep at night. Until he finds something else, something better, that addresses the problem directly.Jack meets Tyler Durden - a man who lives a fulfilling and meaningful life far, far outside of the rules of society. He lives in squalor and filth, not as a result of poverty, but as the result of having rejected the materialist lifestyle of the young American worker. He knows what he wants out of life, he has a plan, and this makes Jack admire him to the point of exaltation. Jack and Tyler begin the fight club, a kind of therapy for the middle-class working bachelor who has no meaning in his life, but it ends up going farther than Jack ever imagined. This is Jack's first mistake, and a road to a very dark place. Much of the movie's message really hinges on whether or not he wants to be there in the end.---Spoilers ahead---Another Sunday spent movie watching. I've seen this film about a dozen times, and it gets better and better with each re-watch. This time I was left questioning Jack's final feelings on the actions of Project Mayhem. In the final scene it seems to be really left up to us to decide whether Tyler managed to free Jack from his chains, or whether we are to believe that Tyler went too far. Or do we get a combination of their two extreme viewpoints. Does freedom require violent rebellion?Jack doesn't seem too concerned that he has blown up all of the major credit-card company's headquarters. His final struggle was to overcome Tyler's control over his life and retain his sanity. Watching the skyscrapers plunge to the ground, accompanied by the soulful vocals of Where is my Mind by The Pixies, I'm personally filled with a sense of peace and acceptance. Let the chips fall where they may, as Tyler said. Jack fought against Tyler's incredibly dramatic strike for economic equilibrium, but now that it has happened and there is nothing we can do about it, we may as well enjoy the outcome. I think this is the best I can do to put the message into words. We're not struggling against our own rebellion any more. It's happened and we're enjoying the ride.

Upon arriving at the compound Max discoverers that the compound is surrounded by brutal looking raiders who intent on invading the perimeter. The rest of film plays out brilliantly with yet more epic chase\/battle sequences. Another notable aspect of this film is the score composed by Brian May, Mel Gibson shines as Max, he conveys so much emotion with his eyes. This story also features one of the most bad-ass villains of all time; The Humungus, whose face is never revealed and wore a hockey mask berfore Jason Voorhees ever did. And who could forget the feral kid and his razor boomerang. To summarise this film is a masterpiece, its a film that has stuck with me ever since I first watched it.

The Road Warrior is definitely in my top 20 films of all time, I first viewed it at age 13 and it blew my mind. Everything about this film is memorable; Max's torn leather clothing and leg brace, his battle scared Ford Falcon coupe, and his neckerchief wearing canine companion are truly iconic. Despite taking place in a post apocalyptic Australia it plays out like a kind of western. The film opens with a perfectly done vinyette, narrated by Harold Baigent. This sequence depicts world war 3 and the downfall of society shortly afterwards.

I like 'time capsule' films of the period, so I gave it a try.The scenery and settings are enjoyable, the soundtrack typical of the period. The acting of Spencer Tracy and Sidney Poitier was very good. So were his parents and Katherine Hepburn. The portrayal of the daughter was somewhat stereotypical of a liberal early-mid 1960s upper class bay area girl.Tillie (future 'Weezie' of 'The Jeffersons') gave a great performance both as an individual, but also as a member of any group who sees one of their peers move beyond what they were told they were allowed, as well as a genuine protectiveness toward 'Joey'.The most disturbing question of the film was briefly addressed by Spency Tracy's character - why present this as an all or nothing ultimatum that has to be settled in a day? The answer was given as 'we love each other, why wait?'. But if he really loved her, he would have given both sets of parents a little time to absorb something so important. This would be true even if they were the same race. Why force someone to accept or reject someone for life within the first hour of meeting them? I suppose it had to be done this way for the dramatic effect.By glossing over this very important question, the rest of the film become an axe grinding message for me. If you are for them right now, you're good, if you question it, you're a 'bigot'. Real life isn't that simple. Were they planning to 'play chicken' with everyone for the rest of their lives after they got married?

The joy is in observing the rather articulate nuances that the characters must undertake when particular farming tasks require particular tools and items for a job at hand; the film eventually coming to resemble a tale about a man most probably as alien to farming as the audience and enjoying it as much as we enjoy watching his taking up of this challenge. The farming within the film, in its specificities revolving around the planning; the predicting; the techniques and the use of certain items and animals for certain events, is as intrinsic as the film's core study of greed and the capitalist infused garnering of an industrial item, an item which will bring large amounts of personal wealth and riches, eventually at the expense of others. The film eventually coming to form a remarkably executed, heart breakingly tragic, blackly comic, devilishly well put together period drama from France well worth checking out.The film begins with a young man named Ugolin (Auteuil) returning home to the South of France, and his uncle's farm, having served time with the French army; the soundtrack a dry and sleepy orchestral tune suggesting much in the way of travels and tiredness, only momentarily breaking off into louder bursts of a much more positive tone as he nears home. Upon arriving home, Ugolin takes clear glee in rushing to a small patch of soil on the grounds and unwrapping a plant of some kind so he may observe it; something he appears to enjoy more than being reconciled with his uncle after such a stretch of time and furthermore suggesting an inclination towards agricultural work, his dream eventually revealed to be one of which revolves around the growing and selling of flowers for a living. His uncle is Cesar (Montand), an elderly man whom demands Ugolin find a wife and have children in the near future so that the land may be passed down and kept within the family; his other eye on a stretch of land lying nearby to his own, a stretch functional enough as it stands and with a natural spring beneath it capable of escalating the quality of the goods that only Cesar knows of, but a stretch already owned by a man no way willing to just sell up.Berri spends a good deal of time with these two farmers, their dreams; their positions and their core characteristics filling up most of the film's opening act. We come to like them during this early part and their blackly funny misadventures as well as their dry observations on life and newfound situations which open up as a result of other events. We side with young Ugolin, this simple young man whom has only just returned from national service and wishes to move into floristry. It is only when the titular Jean of Florette arrives, in the form of Gérard Depardieu, that we see the true nature of them; Jean being the rightful heir to that of the land when Cesar and Ugolin accidentally-on-purpose murder the owner of the land thus bringing Jean into the equation following a string of other legal complications with the rightful land owner.Jean and his family of wife Aimee (Elisabeth Depardieu) and young daughter Manon (Mazurowna) are not used to such surroundings; their previous incarnation of living in a more urbanite locale ill preparing them for what they come into contact with here, the beauty and calmness of the locale coming to resemble mere surface featurettes as those within plot and brew. The obvious distinctions between themselves and those more attributed to the land arrive in the form of their clear differences in clothing, as well as their talk of things of a more cultured nature, namely the opera, as on occasion Aimee breaks out int chorus of song to Jean's own harmonica tunes.What unfolds is a game of cat and mouse and hope and frustration between the two farmers, in Ugolin and Cesar, and the Florettes whom hang around much to the annoyance of their neighbours whom still want the land, know of its true flourishing nature and retain the spring as their secret. Jean's gradual coming around to realise how wondrous and how magnificent the locale is, and how enthralling the individual tasks and procedures which make up farming echoes our own coming around to feel similarly towards the film. Just as agricultural activity is fresh to that of Jean, the arrival of he and his family acts as a fresh and very crisp presence within the film to that of the audience; the very gradual bringing of the audience around on Berri's behalf to have us see the two original farmers as cruel and calculating businessmen as this initial outsider and his family capture our hearts, is outstanding.

This film seems to be afraid of becoming anything more than a series of mini- interviews\/vignettes.If this movie truly wanted to be audacious, it would have to have made more than a few brief subtle references to Hegel. And it would have at least made some mention of Marx. But, unsurprisingly, this is a movie for the masses and we can't have any communist revolutions now can we?In addition, since when is something produced by 'Fox Searchlight' considered 'indie'? The other Linklater film, A Scanner Darkly (also horrible) was produced by 'Warner Bros. Independent Pictures'... an oxymoron... no?The shallow questions asked in this movie have shallow answers, examples abound.The discussions about God are largely irrelevant especially to a properly (emphasis) educated audience.The gas can man and the loudspeaker car were near riots I'm sad and sorry to say. If the gas man wants a voice, he should get an education so that then, maybe he'll have opinions that matter... the ignorant are ignored for a reason after all. The driver of the car, for all his rants, made no mention of Marx whom he should have mentioned if he wanted people to 'wake up.'And the chemistry prof's little tirade about neo-humans and humans? Are you kidding me? A discussion of evolution with no mention of Hegel? This guy should stick to his day job which appears to have been biochemistry; and leave philosophy to genuine philosophers. These are just a few of the jokes you're in for when you see this movie.

It stars Doris Day, Howard Keel, Allyn Ann McLerie, Phillip Carey & Dick Wesson. The score features music by Sammy Fain and lyrics by Paul Francis Webster. Out of Warner Brothers, the film is seen as a response to the success of MGM's production of Annie Get Your Gun in 1950, where Keel was also starring. Plot here is loosely based on the life of Wild West heroine Calamity Jane (Day) and explores the relationship between Wild Bill Hickok (Keel) and herself. I guess the first thing that should be said is that this is no biography of one Martha Jane Cannary Burke (AKA Calamity Jane), In truth this is more a comedy musical romp built around the famous frontiers woman. And with it being very basic on narrative and direction, this really only appeals to the film fan with musical leanings. But on that score the film is delightful, with spirited lead performances from Day & Keel and a handful of truly great tunes headed by the Oscar winning Secret Love. The film also earns some bonus points for giving Day the chance to play something other than the naive innocent girl next door type (it was a personal favourite role of hers). She gets to be spunky and brash without ever losing that adorable appeal that carried her throughout her career. The play on sexual stereotypes is rather humorous without being twee, something that you feel Butler was under appreciated for, and Wilfred M. Cline's colour photography enhances the playfulness of it all. Seen now as a feminist fantasy with a gay following thanks to Secret Love, there's no denying the film is all very Hollywoodized; with characters so animated they could burst. But all told, if one is able to forgive and see past its flaws then it's a film guaranteed to light up the darkest of wintry days. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"18 January 2011","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Calamity Jane is directed by David Butler and written by James O'Hanlon.

Turner needs time to recover while Hurt is somber, numb, and grief-stricken to the point that he walks around in a daze, his face and demeanor barely able to contain the agony and loss he feels. That is when he meets, by chance or fate, a quirky dog trainer(played by Geena Davis who is a delight)who awakens in him a reason to live again. Turner, however, after time apart, wants to reenter his life and start over. THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST follows Hurt's dilemma, having to choose between the woman he will always love and the new person who resuscitated him with her charm and unrelenting pursuit for his affections. I think what makes Lawrence Kasdan's THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST work so well is that it's wholly believable and speaks from the heart, the performances of the three leads completing winning you over because they come from a realistic place. Hurt and Turner, as many married couples do, grieve to the point that they can no longer be around each other due to the painful recollection of the son they lost. Hurt is a travelogue writer who doesn't really enjoy the places as much as clinically define the experiences in a literal instead of pleasurable sense. Davis wears loud, colorful dresses, flashes a bright, wattage smile that is hard to resist(with a personality to match)and is actually the one who instigates the relationship. Hurt actually benefits from being around her because Davis is the type of person whose attitude and personality rub off on you. Turner, though, represents what he once had which is why he returns to her with little difficulty, although I think we can see all too well that this is window dressing. Davis, the other woman, is persistent in being a part of Hurt's life despite his heavy resistance. Meanwhile, there's a subplot regarding Hurt's wallflower sister(Amy Wright)and his publisher(Bill Pullman)who become an item, although she is dedicated to her family(Ed Begley, Jr. and David Ogden Stiers)which might test their courtship. Ultimately, I felt, the film is about healing and moving on past a horrific incident which stifles those truly affected. Turner and Hurt do eventually realize that the love between them will forever last, even if they can no longer be together as husband and wife. It's amusing how an unruly dog(owned by Hurt)is the reason for his meeting Davis in the first place(it bit a neighbor). Established in the film is Hurt's bouts with intense back pain, often a source of misery for him. The end of the 80s was good for Davis who seemed to perform at a high level entering into the next decade. Hurt successfully carries the film as a broken father and listless husband who so desperately needed someone like Geena to give him hope and some semblance of potential happiness. Turner, for the exception of maybe BODY HEAT, has never been more beautiful.

Trench. Sylvie Trench. I admire your luck Mr...? Bond. James BondWith those three words, against the background of the famous James Bond theme, an unknown Scottish actor called Sean Connery introduced 007, the most famous super spy secret agent in the world, a suave sophisticated killing machine, a man everyman wants to be and every woman wants to be with.I still regard this introduction as one of the most memorable cinematic scenes in history. It was just as good as the scene in Goldfinger, but let me not get ahead of myself.In the casino just before Bond gets his briefing to investigate the murder of a fellow British agent, Bond was engaged in a game of cards with Slyvie Trench a voluptuous beautiful woman who was to herald all the other Bond women that was to follow-beautiful, seductive and deadly. I've always felt that the movie did not do enough justice to her. I mean she must get some credit for the arrogant way of introducing herself with the surname first and which inspired Bond to do the same. Anyway life is not fair...Despite that, Dr. No, the first official James Bond movie is a gem. After Bond get his briefing from M played inscrutably by Bernard Lee, 007 travels to Jamaica where he meets CIA agent Felix Leither (Jack Lord of Hawaii 5-0 fame). Leither is on a mission to investigate interference with their missile signals so both men team up to face a common enemy.The plot is tight, exciting, with enough type of good old fashioned detective to elevate it from a cheap spy thriller. Aided by Quarrel,a Jamaican they try to penetrate Dr. No's Lair and it is one of the islands that he meets Honey Rider. (Hmmmmm-Ian Flemming and his suggestive names)The meeting with Honey Rider was another memorable scene in Dr. No where Honey Rider(Ursula Andress), clad in a bikini and a knife, emerges from the sea like a golden sea goddess or nymph and makes our good old English macho spy start singing Underneath the Mango Tree... (Ahhh!I will sing that song a million times if it will guarantee such a woman coming to me from the ocean).Unfortunately (or fortunately depending on your point of view), such a thing can happen only to James Bond. That is why we both love and hate the lucky bastard.Then we finally meet the bad guy Dr. No. A half-Chinese scientist played by Joseph Wiseman. His dead pan face and expressionless monologue would set the standard for all other Bond villains. He was great and the verbal face off between him and Bond is one of the best dialogues I have ever seen in Bond movies.Other stand out characters were the a trio of assassins masquerading as Three Blind Men, Quarrel, and Bond's evil paramour.But still kudos belongs to Sean Connery and his brilliant interpretation of James Bond, which was different from what Ian Flemimg had in mind. But later he admitted that in retrospect, he would have moulded Bond's character in the form of Connery. To me Connery is James Bond. His acting in Dr. No would be considered harsh and impatient and rough but still he managed to pull it off and endeared himself to millions of female fans.The action in Dr. No would be considered quite tame by today's standards but then critics called it torturous, violent, racist and sexist.Despite all this, Dr. No is a great movie.

And, like all good noir, the film has no pretty boys--just solid acting and realism.The film begins with a frustrated Lieutenant (Cornel Wilde) lamenting that months of work have failed to come up with anything useful to convict a local mobster (Richard Conte). To make things worse, the Captain has ordered the investigation to be dropped. So, on his own, Wilde pushes those around Conte to testify against him. The problem is, Conte is ruthless and has two seemingly gay thugs (Lee Van Cleef and Early Holliman) to do his dirty work. Ultimately, however, things start to break--can tough-cop Wilde finally get the goods on him? The film is much more brutal and harsh in style than most noir. In particularly, its handling of a taboo for the Post-Production Code era (gay hit men)--though it's not 100% obvious. But, for 1955, it's pretty risqué...and tough.

His films adapted from his stage plays are all much better than his original screenplays, but Heist is a good effort. The film is about long time criminal Joe Moore, played by Gene Hackman. Joe begrudgingly takes on one last heist to steal a shipment of gold. However, Joe's employer sends along his nephew to ensure that the the haul from the heist is split evenly. Things play out like a fairly typical crime thriller, but the film is plenty entertaining and bares enough merit to warrant approval.Heist has plenty of good things going for it. To begin, it has a great cast full of a diverse amount of people with wide ranges of skill. Gene Hackman is great in his leading role and he fits the role excellently. He is an actor that can carry a film very well, and in Heist he does just that. Opposite Hackman is Danny DeVito as the sinister Mickey Bergman, Hackman's sleazy employer. He becomes your typical archetypal villain by the end of the film, but DeVito plays him great nonetheless. The rest of the supporting cast includes talents such as Rebecca Pidgeon, Delroy Lindo, and Ricky Jay as the other three members of Hackman's crew. They're each very different and played to a fun extent by their respective actors. Sam Rockwell, a current favorite of mine, is DeVito's nephew. He's a loser and an idiot, but makes for a fun character that plays into the story very well. That being said, the storyline in Heist isn't actually anything spectacular. It's fun and intriguing, but when you break it down it isn't terribly unique. But hey, at least the film has a story right? Heist has a very stylistic feel to it that I would have liked to see go further than it did. It does a lot of cool stuff that does keep it interesting throughout. For one, the score is great. Theodore Shapiro composed the original score for the film and it adds a lot to the style. It heightens some of the best moments of the film and also gives it a somewhat 80's thriller feel which I found entertaining at least. Probably one of the most interesting and well written aspects of the film would be the way this group of criminals pull off all of their heists. It is all through acting and improv skills. It constitutes dressing up as different professions and setting up false scenarios in order to set up situations. The heist itself could have gone a lot further but it is still fun. It lacks the depth that Mamet's other thrillers, but doesn't disappoint overall. I compared it to Mamet's directorial debut, House of Games (1987) and the depth of that film and the levels of the con\/heist that developed in that movie. Heist had the potential to reach this level but unfortunately didn't quite make it.It shocks me to say that the main area where Heist falls short would be its story and script. The story is what it is and I found plenty of enjoyment for what it was worth, but there were some very noticeable issues with the screenplay. For the most part it is good. However, it is not consistent. There are moments in the film that definitely feel like Mamet. There are some very witty and insightful profundities that spring up from time to time in this film that brought a smile to my face. But there are other moments when characters utter things so silly, unnecessary, and absurd that you have to wonder what Mamet was thinking when he wrote it. Like I said before, Mamet's true talent lies in his playwriting ability rather than his screen writing ability. Some lines that may have looked good on paper just didn't translate well to the movie. Thankfully none of the nonsense that appears in this script is terribly blatant or it would have been a much bigger issue.Heist is far from perfect but it is undoubtedly fun. It is a fun film, especially if you are into big crime flicks. There isn't a whole lot to Heist and overall it isn't that memorable. But I had a good time while watching it, so I can give it credit for entertaining me for those two hours. It is not Mamet's best effort as far as the script goes, especially because I know how much better he can do (ie. Glengarry Glen Ross, House of Games, etc.) But looking at Heist as just another film, I was at least satisfied by the end and didn't regret watching the film one bit.

However, it is not consistent. There are moments in the film that definitely feel like Mamet. There are some very witty and insightful profundities that spring up from time to time in this film that brought a smile to my face. But there are other moments when characters utter things so silly, unnecessary, and absurd that you have to wonder what Mamet was thinking when he wrote it. Like I said before, Mamet's true talent lies in his playwriting ability rather than his screen writing ability. Some lines that may have looked good on paper just didn't translate well to the movie. Thankfully none of the nonsense that appears in this script is terribly blatant or it would have been a much bigger issue.Heist is far from perfect but it is undoubtedly fun. It is a fun film, especially if you are into big crime flicks. There isn't a whole lot to Heist and overall it isn't that memorable. But I had a good time while watching it, so I can give it credit for entertaining me for those two hours. It is not Mamet's best effort as far as the script goes, especially because I know how much better he can do (ie. Glengarry Glen Ross, House of Games, etc.) But looking at Heist as just another film, I was at least satisfied by the end and didn't regret watching the film one bit. ","genre":"Action, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"18 January 2011","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" David Mamet is undeniably great when it comes to writing... for the stage. His films adapted from his stage plays are all much better than his original screenplays, but Heist is a good effort. The film is about long time criminal Joe Moore, played by Gene Hackman. Joe begrudgingly takes on one last heist to steal a shipment of gold. However, Joe's employer sends along his nephew to ensure that the the haul from the heist is split evenly. Things play out like a fairly typical crime thriller, but the film is plenty entertaining and bares enough merit to warrant approval.Heist has plenty of good things going for it. To begin, it has a great cast full of a diverse amount of people with wide ranges of skill. Gene Hackman is great in his leading role and he fits the role excellently. He is an actor that can carry a film very well, and in Heist he does just that. Opposite Hackman is Danny DeVito as the sinister Mickey Bergman, Hackman's sleazy employer. He becomes your typical archetypal villain by the end of the film, but DeVito plays him great nonetheless. The rest of the supporting cast includes talents such as Rebecca Pidgeon, Delroy Lindo, and Ricky Jay as the other three members of Hackman's crew. They're each very different and played to a fun extent by their respective actors. Sam Rockwell, a current favorite of mine, is DeVito's nephew. He's a loser and an idiot, but makes for a fun character that plays into the story very well. That being said, the storyline in Heist isn't actually anything spectacular. It's fun and intriguing, but when you break it down it isn't terribly unique. But hey, at least the film has a story right? Heist has a very stylistic feel to it that I would have liked to see go further than it did. It does a lot of cool stuff that does keep it interesting throughout. For one, the score is great. Theodore Shapiro composed the original score for the film and it adds a lot to the style. It heightens some of the best moments of the film and also gives it a somewhat 80's thriller feel which I found entertaining at least. Probably one of the most interesting and well written aspects of the film would be the way this group of criminals pull off all of their heists. It is all through acting and improv skills. It constitutes dressing up as different professions and setting up false scenarios in order to set up situations. The heist itself could have gone a lot further but it is still fun. It lacks the depth that Mamet's other thrillers, but doesn't disappoint overall. I compared it to Mamet's directorial debut, House of Games (1987) and the depth of that film and the levels of the con\/heist that developed in that movie. Heist had the potential to reach this level but unfortunately didn't quite make it.It shocks me to say that the main area where Heist falls short would be its story and script.

Well, of the aliens, yes&#x85;just not the 1979 Ridley Scott movie Alien (#1 of 4, so far.)This is how it went down When I was a kid, I watched all and any horror I could get my hands on. Of course, mostly with the permission from my parents who wouldn't even let me watch Gremlins. Somehow Alien got past me and I must've watched the (far superior, I wouldn't know until much later) sequel Aliens a dozen or 50 times. So, I was kinda used to that one and loved the action and the multiple aliens.See? That was the problem. You sincerely backtrack by watching #2 first followed by the original. The movie is one&#x85;of&#x85;the&#x85;slowest&#x85;moving&#x85;pictures I've ever seen. And it only contained ONE alien (not counting the face-hugger or the eggs) that's only shown after a good hour or more passes AND then in only bursts of screen time.When you're a kid, this is un-scary and thoroughly unacceptable. Hence, I didn't care for it back then. What happens when you're an adult, as I am now? Yeah, same. I was unfrightened and bored for the most part.Lucky for the movie, the only real bad thing I observed was the pacing. The one alien concept, I accept, was necessary to show how threatening these things were. But also, in 1979 with budgets and such, I'm sure it was also the only thing they could do. (Thanks, James, for the sequel and confidence.)But, by God, the pacing&#x85;tick tock. I'm shocked this wasn't directed by Michael Mann (Heat, The Insider, and Manhunter,) one of my least favorite directors for his inch-by-inch\/minutes feel like hours story telling.Okay, I'll give it to the adults (it is rated R, so I assume &#x96; ha &#x96; that no one under 17 was admitted) in 1979 that this idea, though not entirely fresh &#x96; alien attacks were a 1950s staple duh, might have scared some people because, quite possibly, it was the first hard R gorefest involving an (not illegal, but space) alien with a budget.Also, the movie had excellent acting and rich characters with depth &#x96; I've been told, though not confirmed, that the cast didn't care for each other, but you wouldn't tell that here, an excellent score, gorgeous cinematography, fantastic sets and designs and introduced two of the best characters in cinema history Ellen Ripley (Weaver) and of course the never-ending\/hard-to-kill Alien.Up to the point of those last few praises, you'd think I hated the movie. Well, no, but it's nothing I ever want to revisit. I can appreciate all those wonderful qualities, plus, again, I loved the character of Ripley and the idea of the alien&#x85;but I can enjoy myself tenfold in the follow-up, Aliens.A quick rundown of the synopsis hard working\/middle class space miners are returning to Earth from deep space when Mother, their ship's version of Hal 9000 or Computer (on the USS Enterprise, the NCC 1701 version, not the one where porn's shown freely) intercepts a distress call and commands the ship to investigate. The crew's awaken from their cryogenic sleep and are unhappy.Well, they will be soon when one is impregnated from a soft alien scorpion. (VERY) soon the full blown alien bursts, literally, onto the scene and it's up to the unprepared passengers to fight off the unwanted guest. Actually, they're more like cattle, until the unlikeliest (in 1979, that is) hero(ine) emerges, warding off both machine, man and beast. Talk about a bad wake up call.Again, the movie is very well crafted &#x96; this did elevate the same ole alien story with great special effects and we have to thank both Director Scott and Sigourney Weaver for creating such an awesome character in Ripley. But, get a Mountain Dew before watching or have the patience of a hungry tortoise who's a mile from food to get through to the end. Better yet, pop in Aliens. They'll give you the run down on this entire movie in a just a few brief minutes and then you can enjoy all the action, drive and horror the aliens can really produce.
