I have been wanting to see this film for some time, I'm so happy I got to see it. I'm especially happy because I saw it on the big screen. Believe me, if you have any desire to see it, see it in a theartre.         The film has so many great things going for it. The acting, the story, the love, and how could I forget the action.         The acting is very good. Chow Yun Fat delivers a superb performance. I was especially impressed with Rachel Yeoh's performance, she was great. But the biggest surprise for me was that of the young actress who played Jen. She should be a big star in the future.         The story is very good. I'm not going into plot details because I'm sure if you're reading this than you know what the plot is. But the story is well put together and shot.          The two love stories in the film are very well executed. The unspoken romance betwwen Chow Yun Fat and Rachel Yeoh was very interesting to watch. But the one between Jen and Lo was touching. The scenes in the desert are pretty funny.           Now of course how can you talk about the film without talking about the action. The action is so well done I wanted to cry,(not really). The fight scenes are always spectacular. There are I would say five or six big fights in this film. Each one of them is different and interesting. The fight scenes go from them flying around each other and climbing walls like Spider Man, or two woman using countless numbers of weapons, (they all keep breaking). I have been to thousands of movies. And I've never seen an audience stand up and applaud the film in the middle of the scene, they did after the first chase\/fight scene.            I went with my friend who couldn't quite grasp the fact that this is a fantasy. He liked it but he thought some of the flying got rediculous. But I don't care, it was always awesome. The film has my vote for Best Pic at the Oscars. First it was Gladiator, then Traffic, but I'm sticking to this film. This film is a magical expierince, a must see. 10\/10          ","genre":null},{"date":"17 February 2001","score":"","review":"             oh my god.

First, Hannibal was a well made film, and the performances turned in by Sir Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore were outstanding. The premise of the movie was interesting, as it put Hannibal in the unique position of potentially becoming a victim. Hopkins made the character equal parts dangerous and charming, as well as having a sense of humor. Moore, in taking over the role of FBI agent Clarice Starling, did what few actors in the movie industry would even attempt - playing a popular character originally played by an actor who is one of the very best (Jodie Foster). Though Moore seemed a little subdued, this is the way I expected Starling to be after 10 years from the last time we saw her. (If anyone doubts Ms. Moore's acting ability, I would suggest they go rent Boogie Nights. In that film, she displayed a strong range of emotions.) The part I found most interesting, though, was that of Detective Pazzi. He was a classic case of a flawed, yet not unlikeable, character whose actions lead to tragedy. Very Shakespearian. Overall, the movie was stylish and the cinematography was fine. I really enjoyed the more graphically intense scenes (those who saw the movie know what I mean), but I enjoyed them mostly because I had given up hope that today's make everything safe for children to see movie execs actually allowed the scenes to make it to the screen. To those who dismiss the movie as gross, or say that they liked Hannibal better in Silence of the Lambs because it only hinted at what kind of atrocious acts the good doctor is capable of, I say this; many of the people I know felt teased by SOTL, and they wanted to see Hannibal not just talking about his skills but performing them. This movie definitely gives us more than just some chilling dialogue about his acts. As for the pace of the film, there are a few scenes where things seem a bit slow, which would be okay if they added to the tension, but they don't always do this. Anyway, I would definitely recommend this movie not only to fans of Silence of the Lambs, but also to horror fans in general. Just try not to compare it to the original, because in many ways it is its own movie.

Borrowing a line from Roger Ebert, I hated, hated, hated this movie. I have seen over 2000 movies in my life and I think I may rank this one dead last. No matter what category you choose, this movie is an inferior product. The acting is below the quality of most TV dramas. Never once did I believe in the characters as people rather than as actors being put through their paces. There is one scene where a young woman hugs her father with the same emotion as if she were hugging a telephone pole. The acting is so wooden that one is inclined to avert his eyes. The special effects were primitive, even by 1950 standards. I was hoping to be entertained by the science fiction aspects of this movie, but being disappointed understates my reaction. The main event of the story is the rapture - where all the good people are simultaneously taken to heaven by Jesus. In fact the good people do disappear about a quarter of the way into the film, but not once do we get to see an actual disappearance. We just see clothes left behind. I always thought the idea was that people's souls ascended to heaven while the body was left behind. But in this movie it appears that Jesus wants naked bodies in heaven. Big opportunities were missed by not allowing us to see the immediate effects of people being yanked off the planet - cars crashing, planes going down, dishes clattering to the floor, surgeries stopped in mid-stream, nuclear power plants going unmanned, dogs unleashed on their walks, and so forth. We see none of this actually happening. At best we get shots of the aftermath, like a multi-car accident, or passengers in a plane trying to figure out what happened. All the interesting stuff is left out and all we see is some obviously staged after effect shots. The only reasons I can think of for this are either a lack of imagination or a limited budget. The music is unremarkable - some generic rock music (a transparent attempt to appeal to a younger audience) and a few swelling crescendos to accompany the experiencing the awe of God scenes. But the worst thing about this movie is the horrendous screenplay. The script could have been written in a way to engage us in honest thought as to what constitutes a good life - the ultimate moral question. But, judging from the people who are taken in the rapture in this movie, it seems that the only good people are the devout Christians and children. This does not seem to me to be realistic. For one thing, based on my recollections of childhood, I recall an amazing number of acts of undisguised meanness. Should all children be given a free pass to heaven? And most of the people left behind seemed like pretty decent sorts to me - I would liked to have had more information as to just why they were left behind. We are given no first-hand knowledge of the people who were taken, so it is hard to compare their qualifications for being taken with those who are left behind. And one has to question the beneficence of a God who would, through an act of supposed kindness, cause such chaos and grief on earth - a loving mother ripped from her family, children taken, planes crashing, cars crashing, communication broken down, and so forth. The ultimate message seems to be turn to the Bible, family, and God. Is this message something we have never heard before? It is hard to know who this movie is aimed at. I guess for Christians the sermon delivered here is an affirmation of their faith, but for non-Christians this is a sermon they have endured ad nauseam. Give your money to your favorite charity, don't give it in support of such worthless nonsense as Left Behind.

Starring Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, Lucy Liu, Bill Murray.CHARLIE'S ANGELS is the kind of movie that seems to be a miracle- it had everything to go wrong... but (surprise!) it is pretty fine indeed. Yes, I was also not trusting at CHARLIE'S ANGELS, but I was pleasantly surprised. See my situation I never liked the TV series very much. It was fun, but the three leads, especially Farrah Fawcett, didn't know how to act. Maybe it took itself too seriously. What happens in the movie is just the opposite- it doesn't take itself seriously in any moment, so we can accept all the implausible scenes (there are many of them).Much of my praise go to the three leads, who make us forget how Farrah Fawcett, Jaclyn Smith and Kate Jackson, and after that Cheryl Ladd and others, were so sexy-but-bland. Surprisingly, Drew Barrymore is the best of them. She can fight extremely well, acts well as Dylan and makes fun of herself (playing a bad girl turned into a good girl). It's great when she falls naked (!) on the same yard of her house in E.T! Lucy Liu and Cameron Diaz don't stay behind. The first one shines as Alex, the brilliant girl who can't cook, while the latter is Natalie, a clumsy but smart girl who talks on the cell phone while defeating the bad guys. Not to talk that all of them look very, very, very good. Bill Murray, as Bosley, doesn't need presentations.A great thing are the fight sequences. Drew Barrymore, who was also a co-producer, forbid the use of guns, so the three angels have to use their muscles to defend themselves and defeat the bad guys. In fact, these sequences are kind of ironic, shamelessly copied from THE MATRIX (when a bullet is shot against Drew Barrymore and it makes the same movement of the bullets in THE MATRIX, we have no doubt).So you may ask what's their mission? In the movie, they apparently have to rescue a genius of the computers. But their mission is to make you have fun... and it works marvelously! So despite the usual plot holes and implausible situations, and the over-the-top direction by McG, an MTV son, put in your mind that this is not a work of art, but a big budget Hollywood flick, more uncompromising than most. CHARLIE'S ANGELS is pretty good it has some hilarious lines, very funny scenes, great fight sequences, a fun soundtrack, sexy and gorgeous three leads, it's charming and colorful, and there's even a place for an unexpected plot twist.

Featuring a cast of hot and hip young stars, this is a movie that manages the task of actually getting progressively worse as each minute passes by.  All this leads to a finale which is a paragon of complete idiocy.Luke Mcnamara (Joshua Jackson) is an all-around good student in Yale University.  He's also become a new member of a secret society called The Skulls.  At first, he thinks he's living the good life.  All of a sudden, he's got a new car and $20000 in his bank account.  However, not everything is all bright and happy.  Luke finds his best friend dead, apparently from a suicide, after he was doing a story on The Skulls.  He begins to suspect another member and friend of his, Caleb Mandrake (Paul Walker), had something to with friend's death.  With the help of Chloe (Leslie Bibb) and one of the mysterious leaders of The Skulls (William Petersen), Luke tries to uncover the mystery to his friend's death, which could very well put his life in jeopardy.The worst aspect (which, believe me, was quite hard to choose from) of this thriller must be the script from John Pogue, which is blatant in its complete idiocy.  The film contains so many obvious plot holes and logic leapholes it's almost hilarious.  The dialogue is as equally atrocious, and you have to wonder if this isn't meant to be a partial comedy.There are a lot of things in the movie that don't make sense.  For one, why would The Skulls, a society so powerful, actually rely on the leaders to the dirty work and coverups instead of a crony or smaller member.  You also have to wonder why during a certain scene a few of the characters decide not to make a copy to crucial tape, especially when they had plenty of time to do so.  There's also a scene involving Jackson acting like a vegetable during a car chase, then all of a sudden acting like a lucid gentleman as soon as the chase is over.The acting is also terrible.  Joshua Jackson shows no charisma and the fact that the script gives him absolutely nothing to do doesn't help, either.  Paul Walker is just as bad, trying to play a person who's conflicted by his conscience, but he just comes off laughable.  Leslie Bibb has nothing much to do other than pout and try not to muss up her makeup.  The grown-up performers are slightly better, if only because the embarrassed look on their faces show they should have had better sense than to sign on to this film.Director Rob Cohen seems to believe that cheap thrills is a good form of suspense, so he infuses an abundance of unexciting foot and car chases that generate little to no tension.  Of course, he saves the worst for last.  Had the movie gone somewhere, I might have been willing to give it an extra 1\/2 *, but no.  Instead, what we have is one of the worst endings I've seen in a long while.  It involves a duel, and a character who does could be the most stupid thing that can be done in such a situation, and that is actually to throw his gun down.  This is the kind of intelligence the film portrays, and if you don't think scenes like this seriously underestimate your intelligence, then this could be the film for you.  Otherwise, this is a film better used as a doorstop.

Featuring a cast of hot and hip young stars, this is a movie that manages the task of actually getting progressively worse as each minute passes by.  All this leads to a finale which is a paragon of complete idiocy.Luke Mcnamara (Joshua Jackson) is an all-around good student in Yale University.  He's also become a new member of a secret society called The Skulls.  At first, he thinks he's living the good life.  All of a sudden, he's got a new car and $20000 in his bank account.  However, not everything is all bright and happy.  Luke finds his best friend dead, apparently from a suicide, after he was doing a story on The Skulls.  He begins to suspect another member and friend of his, Caleb Mandrake (Paul Walker), had something to with friend's death.  With the help of Chloe (Leslie Bibb) and one of the mysterious leaders of The Skulls (William Petersen), Luke tries to uncover the mystery to his friend's death, which could very well put his life in jeopardy.The worst aspect (which, believe me, was quite hard to choose from) of this thriller must be the script from John Pogue, which is blatant in its complete idiocy.  The film contains so many obvious plot holes and logic leapholes it's almost hilarious.  The dialogue is as equally atrocious, and you have to wonder if this isn't meant to be a partial comedy.There are a lot of things in the movie that don't make sense.  For one, why would The Skulls, a society so powerful, actually rely on the leaders to the dirty work and coverups instead of a crony or smaller member.  You also have to wonder why during a certain scene a few of the characters decide not to make a copy to crucial tape, especially when they had plenty of time to do so.  There's also a scene involving Jackson acting like a vegetable during a car chase, then all of a sudden acting like a lucid gentleman as soon as the chase is over.The acting is also terrible.  Joshua Jackson shows no charisma and the fact that the script gives him absolutely nothing to do doesn't help, either.  Paul Walker is just as bad, trying to play a person who's conflicted by his conscience, but he just comes off laughable.

Having arrived in Luxembourg for the ridiculously expensive Valentine's Day premiere at Utopolis, it is now expected to take our cinemas by storm too. And it undoubtedly will, because on paper this is very promising stuff indeed Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt top the bill, Alan Alda supports, and the synopsis is interesting, to say the least.Mel Gibson plays Nick Marshall, a successful advertising executive and notorious `ladies' man' who, after a painful incident involving a bath and a hairdryer, finds he can read women's minds - a welcome gift in theory, but one that turns into a bit of a nightmare and gives our hero his timely come-uppance. His new-found ability (Didn't he realise that men have always been able to read the thoughts of the opposite sex? It's just that, having tuned in, they've never found anything worth listening to ..) initially brings him further success in his job and - more important to the storyline - helps along his romance with his new colleague-cum-rival Darcy McGuire, played by Helen Hunt. But then it all goes pear-shaped as Nick has to cope with the downside of his life as an incorrigible macho.Gibson's influence on this comedy is obvious his very own production company Icon is involved, and there are numerous references to earlier roles of his. And the screenplay gives him plenty of opportunity to show off his real comic talent and the quality of his interplay with Helen Hunt, who gives another solid performance after her parts in Dr T. and the Women, Cast Away and Pay it Forward - all three of them currently enjoying successful runs in Luxembourg's cinemas. (How about spending a whole Sunday afternoon and evening in a darkened room watching a Helen Hunt quadruple-bill?)So far, so satisfactory. What is disappointing, though - and intensely annoying - is the ending, yet again. This is another example of Hollywood just not knowing how to end a movie nowadays. Only recently we have had the embarrassing efforts of Pay it Forward, Cast Away and Harrison's Flowers lingering in the mind long after the final credits, and all for the wrong reasons. But What Women Want not only has a bad conclusion - it also starts off on the wrong foot. Strangely enough, though, the ninety minutes in between are hugely entertaining a spot-on romantic comedy. The jokes work and the love story rings true. Gibson and Hunt make a great couple - they not only look good, they act well too.The film also features a couple of secondary plots - one involving Gibson's screen daughter, the other focusing on a suicidal office-worker.

After seeing this, I fell in love with the story of Selena. I searched the Net for MP3's and Selena CD's... and found that the story had been made into a movie. But not just any movie. An inspiring, breathtaking look at the life of a Hispanic girl with hopes of becoming a world-famous singer.So, naturally, I ran to the video store and rented it. Another plus - the undeniably sexy Jennifer Lopez as the title role. I couldn't wait to see it once I got home, and that 5 minute wait in the car was more than just worth it.The movie is nothing short of amazing. One of Lopez's greatest performances to date (if not the very best), as she is so much like Selena, and the actress playing Yolanda (the woman who shot Selena) looked identical to the real-life lady she was playing.The music - outstanding, the sets and costumes were fantastic, and the final minute of real Selena footage was great.

It is definitely one of the most harrowing movies through which I have ever sat.  And I say that as a former reviewer who sat through many movies.  The camera work, yes, is a bit arty at times.  But it serves to induce the skewered vision of the addicted. I especially related to, and appreciated, the physician-encouraged addiction of Sarah Goldfarb (Burstyn).  Poor Sarah is an innocent, naively trusting in what her doctor tells her - after all, he knows what he is doing!  She winds up as a total psychotic - but at least, a THIN psycho, which is what is important for women!  There are undertones of sexism in America, along with many others, in this film. Marlon Wayans is a delight and so is the rest of the cast.  If this is a low budget movie, it surely doesn't look like it.  Writing, acting, directing, editing, scoring - all well above average.  For women, the end scene of Harry's girlfriend's descent into the hades particular to females is so terrifying, mortifying and hellacious that it will be a long time before we get it out of our minds - if ever. The comparisons to Trainspotting are inevitable.  Trainspotting was excellent in its own right.  But Requiem is the one I think I'll never forget.

How long has it been since he made a film that actually required the audience to think. It's not that he's suddenly become loud and bombastic, it's that he's suddenly stopped doing anything genuinely provocative. Natural Born Killers, for example, is *not* a provocative film. It's a loud and angry and aggressive film. However, the film produced only attacks on the filmmaker (or rather excessive adulation for Stone) and never really stimulated an intelligent national debate. But Salvador, based on the true experiences of photojournalist Rick Boyle, is Stone at his best. It's complicated and full of the mixture of regret, guilt, nostalgia, and outrage that fill the director's landmarks (JFK or Platoon, for example). After all of the violence and horror, it becomes a film about representations of reality and the different reasons for distorting truth.Rick Boyle (James Woods) is at the end of his rope. He's unemployed, his wife just left him. And he's just been thrown in jail for a litany of driving violations. After getting bailed out by his tubby friend Doctor Rock (James Belushi in the role he was probably born to play), he hops in his unregistered car that he isn't licensed to drive, and he heads south to El Salvador. His only companions are Doctor Jack, his alcohol, and his drugs on a journey that can't help but be likened to the drive to Vegas in Hunter S. Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. When he arrives in El Salvador, he finds the country torn apart with leftist rebels fleeing to the hills and a country braced for a bloody democratic election in which a murderous American puppet general will likely be elected. Boyle tries to use his connections to get a press pass and get one last shot to become a success. This is made easier by the Salvadorian woman who loves him and the ace photographer who lends him a hand (John Savage).But not everybody in El Salvador is supportive of the loose cannon journalist. There's the colonel who thinks he's a communist, the military attache who's using him for information, and the local military forces who resent the way Boyle depicted them in a previous campaign. The audience is supposed to be disgusted by the way that Boyle treats himself and those he loves, but there's one important fact that's repeated over and over Boyle was the last journalist out of Cambodia. We know that he stayed to help save people. And it's just a matter of time before he becomes even more personally invested in what's happening in Central America. And that's when things go really crazy.The world of photojournalism depicted in the film is one step from public relations and sometimes not even that. Boyle's major supported among the military leaders is a general about whom Boyle had written a glowing profile. Boyle is also able to curry favor by showing his pictures to American military leaders before trying to publish them. The question that comes up, of course, is why are the pictures being taken at all and how can anybody ever know the truth of any war. Journalists, like everybody else, get caught up in their surroundings. Boyle may be supporting the right side in El Salvador, but he admits to having favored Pol Pot for a brief period years earlier. The difference between canonizing a truly noble leader (like the assassinated Archbishop Romero) and elevating a genocidal lunatic is a small one. Salvador calls into question how American audiences can ever know who to trust in a media covered war. On one hand we have Pauline Axelrod (Valerie Wildman) appearing on air because she's pretty and blond even though she just accepts the official statements as truth. Then there's also Savage's journalist who's willing to do anything to get the perfect shot, to create an image that shows both the conflict and the reasons behind it in a single frame. Idealism and self preservation are competing instincts.The film is pure Stone. The battle sequences are tense and tightly edited and the dialogue (which Stone cowrote with Rick Boyle) is rippingly good, for the most part. Then again, its misogyny is almost worn as a gold star, female characters are, as always, Madonnas or whores, and a rape scene is fairly exploitative. Also in a conversation between Boyle and a conservative US Colonel, Stone unpacks entirely too much of his personal ideology in a series of monologues. The message of the film, about not wanted to create another Vietnam and liberalism not being the same as Communism is much too literally articulated.The film basically hinges on Woods's wonderful performance. His typical manic energy perfectly fits his character's earliest incarnation,  but as Boyle becomes more troubled by what he sees around him, Woods's performance becomes deeper, richer, and more internalized. The rest of the cast has less to do and thus can't really be blamed for not standing out. Belushi's Doctor Jack has Fictitious Composite Character written all over him. Basically we watch as his story arc goes in opposite directions from Woods's at all times.Salvador is perhaps the only film to ever express nostalgia for Jimmy Carter. I like that. I like that it's challenging, dogmatic, but rarely insults my intelligence by saying things that I already know. This is a very fine 8\/10 film.
