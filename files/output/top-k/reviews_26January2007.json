It put real words in peoples' mouths, and even in the most confrontational scenes there was no preachiness. Real people don't stand around preaching at each other; nor did these characters.2. Martin Ritt. It is hard to believe that Ritt, an aging veteran by this point in his career, was not nominated for Best Director. His camera practically floats, in some impressively tight quarters - an actual motel room, an actual textile mill, an actual house. The camera rarely feels backed into a corner and never intrudes into the natural eye view that Ritt superbly controls throughout. Not a rough edit in the entire picture; internals and externals are both handled splendidly (the creek scenes work especially well)...the best compliment you can pay a director is that his touch seems to be invisible. Ritt deserves this high degree of praise.3. Ron Liebman. Liebman is so self assured as Reuben that he creates the color palette from which Field draws her own remarkable performance. It is literally impossible not to view Liebman AS Reuben. Suspension of disbelief is total, because Liebman never, at any point, does anything 'actorly'. It is one of the most relaxed performances you are likely to see, especially when you consider that this is a tense movie and his character is the direct cause of the tension. His performance was ignored by any and all award organizations. Classic (especially supporting) performances often are. Liebman and Field spent considerable screen time together; their chemistry was adult and complicated, and yet never overwhelming. Her win was his triumph as much as it was hers.4.

His characters tend to be likable and aw-shucks simple and enthusiastic. In this movie he was cast as the same type, but was expected to go through an arc of disillusionment as the union takes more and more of his wife's time and attention. Whether because the script demanded it or because this was a difficult transition for Bridges, he gets essentially one scene in which to demonstrate this arc. It is just the right amount. Bridges moves the film along during the middle, helping to develop Norma Rae's family ties and the stresses that her activism is causing; when it is time for the movie to clarify its focus and bring home the last chapter, Bridges is cast aside.

During a stop at a gas station along the freeway she disappears. He frantically tries to report her missing, but no one takes him seriously. The trail of clues quickly turns cold and he gets obsessed by her disappearance and must know what happened. Soon after, the culprit is introduced. His name is Raymond Lemorne (Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu), a father of two children who teaches chemistry at a high-school in his hometown. He is a sociopath and his beneficiary appearance makes his acts seem even more monstrous. So the film is not about who did it, but how this man came to commit such a crime like this. Successful Dutch thrillers are rare, but Spoorloos, based on the book The Golden Egg by Tim Krabbé, manages to sustain an unpleasant tension right till its horrific finale. The film is without any spectacular effects, it's sober with practically no violence on screen, effectively building up an uneasy tension right from the beginning, doing a much more effective job than many better-known films of its kind. The most interesting thing about the film is the structuring, with the story switching back and forward between Rex continuous search for Saskia and Raymond Lemorne's family life and his careful preparations, preceding Saskia's abduction. Having read the book and having seen the film a number of times, the ending is - naturally - not as disturbing as upon first viewing, but if you've never seen this, it will no doubt come of as one of the most shocking endings you'll ever see.Sluizer did a good job in adapting the script together with Tim Krabbé, but his directorial skills are limited.

Five people from many different diverse backgrounds are forced to share a Saturday detention together. After almost nine hours, they bare their souls to each other and actually become friends. (Well, to varying degrees.) This is a movie that you feel, because it portrays the cliques characters associated with high school life with such passion and power that you the viewer believe after watching this unforgettable film that you have known these people all your life! The Breakfast Club IS Andy, Claire, Brian, Alison, and John.The late Paul Gleason is chillingly realistic as the principle and disciplinarian. The tension that exists in his many verbal confrontations with John Bender (the most troubled and rebellious) is so dramatic, and captivating that it represents some of the finest moments that you will ever see in a movie! These kids and Mr. Gleason should have won Oscars for their performances because they were all THAT good! One may wonder, why haven't I rated this gem a full perfect 10\/10? The Breakfast Club is SOOOOOOO good on so many levels that it hurts to find flaws with it, but here goes1.) Carl The Janitor The one guy that just doesn't work in this otherwise landmark film. He doesn't seem to have all that much to say except react differently to how Mr. Vernon and he feel about kids. It's not like he's a bad guy to have in the movie, just unnecessary. Bender makes a few snide remarks about him, and than we have a few lines of dialog when he and Vernon are in Vernon's office, and that's it. It's like Hughes said, Well, the setting is a Saturday School detention, so we can throw in a janitor. He simply didn't need to be there and did practically nothing for plot or character development.2.) SPOILER! Bender being nice to Claire at the end NO!!! NO!!!! Sorry!!! I don't buy it!The movie builds up with such friction where it is the worst between Mr. Vernon and John Bender. (Two people that would want to KILL one another because they hate each other so much.) Second worst friction is Bender's thoughtless and vindictive comments to Claire throughout the film. Remember this gem Bender (To Claire) Don't you EVER TALK ABOUT MY FRIENDS!!! YOU DON'T KNOW ANY OF MY FRIENDS, YOU DON'T LOOK AT ANY OF MY FRIENDS, AND YOU CERTAINLY WOULDN'T STOOP SO LOW AS TO SPEAK TO ANY OF MY FRIENDS!!!! AS FAR AS YOU AND I WAKING DOWN THE HALL TOGETHER YOU CAN FORGET IT!!!!! CUZ IT'S NEVER GONNA HAPPEN!!! JUST GO BURY YOUR HEAD IN THE SAND, AND WAIT FOR YOUR F***ING PROM!!!Claire (Crying and sobbing) I hate you, you know! Bender Yea??? GOOD!!!!! But toward the end of the film, we see Claire GIVING John one of her earrings and a goodbye kiss!!!???? Are you kidding me??!! Than he tries to initiate closer contact but she stops him. I can't believe that they would do that. He'd walk up to her, give Claire and extended middle finger and spit in her face. That IS John Bender. Some of the physical make-overs seem to reflect the writers\/or directors beliefs that emotional personalities can change when a woman changes her appearance with make-up and lipstick. Hughes take a too-easy and simple way out here. Let's make John nice to Claire so that we can have at least two of the group give us this, And some lived happily ever after.

This is a movie that you feel, because it portrays the cliques characters associated with high school life with such passion and power that you the viewer believe after watching this unforgettable film that you have known these people all your life! The Breakfast Club IS Andy, Claire, Brian, Alison, and John.The late Paul Gleason is chillingly realistic as the principle and disciplinarian. The tension that exists in his many verbal confrontations with John Bender (the most troubled and rebellious) is so dramatic, and captivating that it represents some of the finest moments that you will ever see in a movie! These kids and Mr. Gleason should have won Oscars for their performances because they were all THAT good! One may wonder, why haven't I rated this gem a full perfect 10\/10? The Breakfast Club is SOOOOOOO good on so many levels that it hurts to find flaws with it, but here goes1.) Carl The Janitor The one guy that just doesn't work in this otherwise landmark film. He doesn't seem to have all that much to say except react differently to how Mr. Vernon and he feel about kids. It's not like he's a bad guy to have in the movie, just unnecessary. Bender makes a few snide remarks about him, and than we have a few lines of dialog when he and Vernon are in Vernon's office, and that's it. It's like Hughes said, Well, the setting is a Saturday School detention, so we can throw in a janitor. He simply didn't need to be there and did practically nothing for plot or character development.2.) SPOILER! Bender being nice to Claire at the end NO!!! NO!!!! Sorry!!! I don't buy it!The movie builds up with such friction where it is the worst between Mr. Vernon and John Bender. (Two people that would want to KILL one another because they hate each other so much.) Second worst friction is Bender's thoughtless and vindictive comments to Claire throughout the film. Remember this gem Bender (To Claire) Don't you EVER TALK ABOUT MY FRIENDS!!! YOU DON'T KNOW ANY OF MY FRIENDS, YOU DON'T LOOK AT ANY OF MY FRIENDS, AND YOU CERTAINLY WOULDN'T STOOP SO LOW AS TO SPEAK TO ANY OF MY FRIENDS!!!! AS FAR AS YOU AND I WAKING DOWN THE HALL TOGETHER YOU CAN FORGET IT!!!!! CUZ IT'S NEVER GONNA HAPPEN!!! JUST GO BURY YOUR HEAD IN THE SAND, AND WAIT FOR YOUR F***ING PROM!!!Claire (Crying and sobbing) I hate you, you know! Bender Yea??? GOOD!!!!! But toward the end of the film, we see Claire GIVING John one of her earrings and a goodbye kiss!!!???? Are you kidding me??!! Than he tries to initiate closer contact but she stops him. I can't believe that they would do that. He'd walk up to her, give Claire and extended middle finger and spit in her face. That IS John Bender. Some of the physical make-overs seem to reflect the writers\/or directors beliefs that emotional personalities can change when a woman changes her appearance with make-up and lipstick. Hughes take a too-easy and simple way out here. Let's make John nice to Claire so that we can have at least two of the group give us this, And some lived happily ever after.

Many predicted that it would be Kubrick's masterpiece - the film by which he would inevitably be remembered. It isn't, but 'Eyes Wide Shut' remains a stunning film, and nothing less than we've come to expect from this master director.Tom Cruise (Minority Report) is Dr. William Bill Harford, a handsome and successful young doctor, who is happily married to Alice (Nicole Kidman, The Others) with one young daughter, Helena. Bill is loyal to Alice, and he expects the same in return. However, he is severely shocked one night when Alice confesses that, a year earlier, she'd seriously contemplated having an affair with a young Navy officer.Many have complained about the slow pace of 'Eyes Wide Shut.' I didn't find anything negative about it. The slow, meditative pace of the film (which shouldn't come as a surprise to fans of Kubrick's spectacular 2001 A Space Odyssey) gave the film its entire, dream-like quality, and I was simply transfixed to the screen the whole time. The scene where a masked Bill Harford wanders into the mysterious mansion amidst a secret sex ritual is simpling mesmerising, with no small thanks to the great direction from Kubrick. Once again, as always, he's chosen the perfect music to capture the atmosphere of the scene!The only scenes where I thought the film slipped up were a couple of the later mansion scenes, when the mysterious woman was warning Cruise to get out of there. The bit where she said, You are in grave danger! sounded a bit melodramatic (reminded me of 'The Da Vinci Code,' actually), and also when she interrupts Cruise's stern interrogation by yelling, STOP! The quick zoom used in that moment made me laugh...However, an astute fellow IMDb user alerted me to the fact that perhaps Kubrick did this deliberately. The actress in that scene (the mask prevents me from remembering who she actually was) sounded like she was acting because, simply put, her character was just acting. The entire display, as Victor Ziegler (Sydney Pollack) suggests later in the film, may have been an elaborate ploy to scare the wits through Harford. Not being an experienced actor, the woman may have been convincing enough for the terrified and confused Harford, but not necessarily for the astute film viewer sitting in the comfort of their home. Though it is impossible to understand entirely what Kubrick was attempting with that scene, it seems like the sort of thing he'd do!'Eyes Wide Shut' contains great performances from a talented cast. I thought that Tom Cruise shined in the main role, translating the fear and confusion of his character to the screen beautifully. Nicole Kidman was also very good &#150; her slow, brooding delivery of dialogue certainly contributed to the dreamlike quality of the film.This is a quality film from one of the all-time greats of film-making.

The rest of the cast paints to perfection the portrait of Jules Verne's odyssey about a very anal retentive man driven by a wager to complete a global circumnavigation in 80 days in the mid nineteenth century.Jules Verne unlike in a lot of his other stories makes one of his main characters here a Frenchman. Normally the international minded Mr. Verne never had any of his protagonists come from his native France. In this case the valet Passepartout accompanies English gentleman Phileas Fogg on the journey and comes close to wrecking it a couple of times.Michael Todd had to settle for second choices for both of his leads. The part was originally offered to Cary Grant who turned it down and Todd settled happily for David Niven. And even though Fernandel offered to learn English to play Passepartout, the process would have taken too long so the Mexican comic star Cantinfas got the part. Fernandel did have a small role as a Parisian hansom cab driver.It's still a mystery to me as to why Cantinflas on the strength of this and Pepe did not break out of the Latin American market where he was nothing short of a demi-god of the cinema. Certainly his presence in this film opened up a huge market of viewers in the Spanish speaking parts of the world. Also consider that the probably no other performer in the history of the cinema ever got as good supporting casts as Cantinflas did in both Around the World in 80 Days and Pepe. Maybe he didn't break into the English speaking cinema fan world, but it was no accident that all the stars who appeared in both wanted to be associated with him.Shirley MacLaine would have to wait until Some Came Running for a real break out role. She's just not the type to play a Hindu princess. Someone like Jean Simmons who played one in Black Narcissus would have been far better. David Niven however got on the crest of a big career wave that wouldn't reach maximum until his Oscar two years later in Separate Tables. This was one of his best career roles and nice that for once he would not have to carry a mediocre picture on the strength of his considerable charm.Mr. Niven sadly recalls in his memoirs that Robert Newton was already dying when he made Around the World in 80 Days. The doctors had told the screen's most celebrated alcoholic that he had only a short time left when he did this film, his liver was failing. Newton does a grand job as the unctuous conniving detective Fix who gets it into his head that Niven robbed the Bank of England.Around the World in 80 Days won for Best Picture in 1956 and four other Oscars including best musical score. Oddly enough the song Around the World was not nominated in that category even though it was a big hit that year. Bing Crosby for Decca and Eddie Fisher for RCA Victor had the big hit records of it, Frank Sinatra also did it for Capitol. It was a great tribute to its composer Victor Young and lyricist Harold Adamson. Young died in 1956 and the Oscar for Best Scoring was given to him posthumously.Producer Michael Todd and Director Michael Anderson did a first rate job in casting all the small bit roles with major players. A lot of these names are unfamiliar to today's generation, but if they see the film it's a chance to see a lot of great cinema names at one time doing real characters instead of just walking on as themselves.The film holds up well today and can still be enjoyed. Maybe someone will actually try to make it in the transportation mode of the Victorian era. Can it be done in 80 Days?

The rest of the cast paints to perfection the portrait of Jules Verne's odyssey about a very anal retentive man driven by a wager to complete a global circumnavigation in 80 days in the mid nineteenth century.Jules Verne unlike in a lot of his other stories makes one of his main characters here a Frenchman. Normally the international minded Mr. Verne never had any of his protagonists come from his native France. In this case the valet Passepartout accompanies English gentleman Phileas Fogg on the journey and comes close to wrecking it a couple of times.Michael Todd had to settle for second choices for both of his leads. The part was originally offered to Cary Grant who turned it down and Todd settled happily for David Niven. And even though Fernandel offered to learn English to play Passepartout, the process would have taken too long so the Mexican comic star Cantinfas got the part. Fernandel did have a small role as a Parisian hansom cab driver.It's still a mystery to me as to why Cantinflas on the strength of this and Pepe did not break out of the Latin American market where he was nothing short of a demi-god of the cinema. Certainly his presence in this film opened up a huge market of viewers in the Spanish speaking parts of the world. Also consider that the probably no other performer in the history of the cinema ever got as good supporting casts as Cantinflas did in both Around the World in 80 Days and Pepe. Maybe he didn't break into the English speaking cinema fan world, but it was no accident that all the stars who appeared in both wanted to be associated with him.Shirley MacLaine would have to wait until Some Came Running for a real break out role.

And then boredom set in; for some reason Carpenter decided to take his sweet time with getting to the point - namely, the assault on Precinct 13 - and this takes about half-an-hour. But before the assault takes place, Carpenter gives us a major taste of the absurdity to come the scene with the little girl going back for a different ice-cream (but of course...) and then getting shot - just like that - by the gang; they shoot her for no reason and jeopardize their revenge mission that way. Dumb. The father of the girl then chases after the killers, only to reach and kill - of all of the numerous gang members - the one gang member who killed his girl (after getting shot, our vicious yet illogical gang member then falls sideways, like a tree). The father of the girl then gets chased by some other gang members and reaches Precinct 13 where he suddenly loses his ability to speak at the moment when he is trying to inform the Precinct's occupants of the danger they are in! Is this a dumb plot device, or what. Shortly afterwards, the Precinct gets shot at from all sides, the bullets shattering windows and thus making noise, yet Carpenter would have us believe that no-one could hear all that (and come to the rescue) because the gang was using noiseless guns.

Not even the fact that Dupea is played by the great Jack Nicholson can mask the truth that the movie which tells his story is downright dull.

We are just forced to sit and watch as Robert Dupea tries to find himself. While Dupea's finding himself you'll probably be stifling yawns. The fact that the lead character we're following is an irredeemable louse doesn't help matters either. Robert Dupea treats all those around him, most notably his ever-loyal girlfriend, like absolute garbage. He's completely full of himself, which is rather odd for someone working a menial job on an oil rig. Where does this guy get off being so high and mighty? Who the heck is he to think he's so much better than those around him? About halfway through the film we see where that attitude comes from as Dupea goes on a journey back to his childhood home to reconnect with the person he truly is or at least used to be. This is where all that great character study malarkey kicks in. Yes, it turns out Robert Dupea isn't exactly what he initially seems to be. Yes, he's a very complex character. But he's still at heart an awful human being. And this is still a boring movie.Jack Nicholson is certainly one of our finest actors and he does the best he can here but this film just isn't salvageable. The character Nicholson plays is impossible to root for. You end up sympathizing with everyone in the movie but him, a problem since the movie is really about him alone. For the first half of the movie absolutely nothing happens as the filmmakers go out of their way to establish what a mean-spirited jerk Dupea is. Actually that was established in the first five minutes but they belabor the point to tedious effect. Then the great journey home begins and the movie for a few minutes veers off into Bizarro World when Dupea picks up a pair of hippie, lesbian hitchhikers. One of these hitchhikers, named Palm Apodaca which tells you about all you need to know, launches into one of the most bizarre, comical rants in film history. Only she's not trying to be funny, she's deadly serious. If nothing else, at least you the viewer can laugh at the sheer stupidity of it all, which is about all the enjoyment you'll get out of this film. Soon enough Palm and friend are gone and we're back to focusing on Robert Dupea. Who's still a selfish, obnoxious, jerk stuck in an utterly boring movie. A great character study?

If nothing else, at least you the viewer can laugh at the sheer stupidity of it all, which is about all the enjoyment you'll get out of this film. Soon enough Palm and friend are gone and we're back to focusing on Robert Dupea. Who's still a selfish, obnoxious, jerk stuck in an utterly boring movie. A great character study? You can judge that for yourself. A great movie? Absolutely not.

Maybe it is, but that doesn't make it a great movie. The character of Robert Dupea may have made for a nice subject for an article in a psychology journal. But as the lead character in a film he leaves a lot to be desired. Not even the fact that Dupea is played by the great Jack Nicholson can mask the truth that the movie which tells his story is downright dull. Yeah, there's a pretty interesting story in here somewhere but the way that story unfolds on the screen leaves a lot to be desired.The biggest problem with this movie is quite simply that nothing happens. We are just forced to sit and watch as Robert Dupea tries to find himself. While Dupea's finding himself you'll probably be stifling yawns. The fact that the lead character we're following is an irredeemable louse doesn't help matters either. Robert Dupea treats all those around him, most notably his ever-loyal girlfriend, like absolute garbage. He's completely full of himself, which is rather odd for someone working a menial job on an oil rig. Where does this guy get off being so high and mighty? Who the heck is he to think he's so much better than those around him? About halfway through the film we see where that attitude comes from as Dupea goes on a journey back to his childhood home to reconnect with the person he truly is or at least used to be. This is where all that great character study malarkey kicks in. Yes, it turns out Robert Dupea isn't exactly what he initially seems to be. Yes, he's a very complex character. But he's still at heart an awful human being. And this is still a boring movie.Jack Nicholson is certainly one of our finest actors and he does the best he can here but this film just isn't salvageable. The character Nicholson plays is impossible to root for. You end up sympathizing with everyone in the movie but him, a problem since the movie is really about him alone. For the first half of the movie absolutely nothing happens as the filmmakers go out of their way to establish what a mean-spirited jerk Dupea is. Actually that was established in the first five minutes but they belabor the point to tedious effect. Then the great journey home begins and the movie for a few minutes veers off into Bizarro World when Dupea picks up a pair of hippie, lesbian hitchhikers. One of these hitchhikers, named Palm Apodaca which tells you about all you need to know, launches into one of the most bizarre, comical rants in film history. Only she's not trying to be funny, she's deadly serious. If nothing else, at least you the viewer can laugh at the sheer stupidity of it all, which is about all the enjoyment you'll get out of this film.

But when it comes to sheer enjoyment from a flick, Jaws is my #1 film of all time.The mother of all blockbusters has a very simple story a great white shark begins feeding on swimmers at an island beach resort. However, the movie is so much more than that. A young Steven Spielberg creates a visually-stunning and suspenseful film; for instance, the zoom\/dolly close-up of Roy Scheider on the beach has since become a popular camera technique. The acting is excellent, and Robert Shaw's performance is especially unforgettable. The script is solid, and the dialogue is strong. And, despite what people say, Bruce (the mechanical shark) looks great! This is one must-see that even those who usually don't care for must-see movies will love. Three decades have not taken any of this film's power to please.

I put in the DVD and got into bed figuring I would watch an half hour or so and fall asleep. At the end of nearly 2 hours, I was sitting up straight, wide awake, awestruck at the genius in the direction and acting. This is cinema at its finest. I have seen La Strada before and I now rank Fellini's earlier work as among my all time favorites (along with Ozu.) Masina's tearful smile at the camera at the end is pure magic - so much dignity and hope captured in a single second. Her performance throughout the movie was a revelation - she got innocent hope and graceful charm to shine through her foul-mouthed vulgar acting character. I simultaneously cared and despaired for her - this movie pulled me in like no recent Hollywood movie has for a long long time.

I've only given two 10 scores, but i've no doubt in my mind that this movie deserves it. The film was written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, and in my opinion, is superior to Titanic. The film itself is one great scene after another, expertly written and acted in such a way that it reminds me of the Godfather films. The way Sean ( brilliantly acted by Robin Williams) was the only one able to break Will's ( an equally brilliant Matt Damon) tough exterior, really drives the film. The scene in the park where Sean tells Will he knows nothing about life, and that  when i look at you, i don't see a strong, confident young man, i see a cocky, scared s***less kid. Great moments like these come one after another and reaches an emotional climax with the  it's not your fault scene. Minnie Driver's performance as Skylar nearly stole the show. I fell in love with her quirky charm, making it all the more dramatic when there relationship reaches a head with another great moment in the film. This is film any film lover should see. It's a testament to what can be done when two people come with a great story, memorable characters, and a desire to create an incredible film.
