It cleverly jumps between future and the past, and the story it tells is about a man named James Cole, a convict, who is sent back to the past to gather information about a man-made virus that wiped out 5 billion of the human population on the planet back in 1996. At first Cole is sent back to the year 1990 by accident and by misfortune he is taken to a mental institution where he tries to explain his purpose and where he meets a psychiatrist Dr. Kathryn Railly who tries to help him and a patient named Jeffrey Goines, the insane son of a famous scientist. Being provocative and somehow so sensible, dealing with and between reason and madness, the movie is a definite masterpiece in the history of science-fiction films.The story is just fantastic. It's so original and so entertaining. The screenplay itself written by David and Janet Peoples is inspired by a movie named La Jetée (1962) which I haven't seen, but I must thank the director and writer of the movie, Chris Marker, for giving such an inspiration for the writers of Twelve Monkeys. I read a little about La Jetée, it's not the same story but it has the same idea, so this is not just a copy of it. David and Janet Peoples have transformed this great deal of inspiration to a modernized story, which tells about this urgent need for people to find a solution for maintaining human existence and it does it in a so beautiful and a realistic way that it's a guaranteed thrill ride from the beginning till the end. The music used in the film is odd and somehow so funny and amusing it doesn't really fit until you really get it and when you do you realise that it's so compelling, composed by Paul Buckmaster.Terry Gilliam, who we remember from Monty Python, as the director of the movie was a real surprise for me, as I really never thought him as a director type of a person. I know he has directed movies before, but I really couldn't believe that he could make something this magnificent. It shouldn't be a surprise though, as he does an amazing job. You can still sense that same weirdness as in the Python's, but for me the directing is pretty much flawless though in its odd way of describing things it also makes some scenes strangely disturbing. Yes, it is indeed odd, weird, bizarre and disturbing, so it also makes the movie a bit heavy too, so the weak minded viewers will probably find it hard to watch the movie all the way through. It's not as heavy as you could imagine, but it just has these certain things which in their own purpose are sometimes pretty severe to watch. Despite that, the movie holds this pure intelligence inside it and through flashbacks, dreams, jumps between the past and the future it mixes up the whole story in a very clever way and it doesn't even make the plot messy in any part, though it does need concentration from the viewer after all.What comes to acting, well the movie doesn't even go wrong there. The role of James Cole is played by the mighty Bruce Willis, who probably does his best role performance yet to date. Now people may disagree with me, as he did some fine job in for example The Sixth Sense as well, but for me the role of James Cole was so ideal for Willis and he performs it incredibly well. The character is very well written too, yet performed even better. Cole starts to question his own existence and he deals with himself, starting to question his actual time of living, trying to survive and find the crucial missing piece of the puzzle. By hardship he starts to loose his faith, questioning if he can even trust or believe himself. Other role performances worth mentioning are the performances of Madeleine Stow and Brad Pitt. Stow plays the role of Kathryn Railly, the psychiatrist of James Cole, who sees something strangely familiar in Cole and decides to help him to deal with his madness. She somehow starts to believe Cole's story but as a believer of science she tries to find solutions through it and tries to deal with reason when it comes to unbelievable things. Brad Pitt is so good in the role of Jeffrey Goines and he also does one of his best role performances yet to date. The insane yet hilarious personality of the character brought Pitt even an Oscar nomination for it, so I guess I'm not praising the honestly fabulous performance for nothing.All in all, Twelve Monkeys is a great science-fiction experience and it will surely be a recommendation for everyone, especially for the sci-fi fans. It includes brilliant characters and superb role performances, especially from Willis and Pitt, and an original and an entertaining story which forms a plot that's so intelligent and clever. Yet being that already mentioned weird and disturbing it definitely captures the viewer's attention by making it interesting and witty. It's also an explosive thriller and it has romance in it too, so it's all that in same package and that makes it one of the best sci-fi motion pictures I've ever seen. Through the odd yet terrific vision of Terry Gilliam it manages to keep itself in balance despite the somewhat bumpy yet somehow stable ride. Hard to explain really, but that's how it is, it's mind blowing.

We were having a family reunion and we took our kids to see this. Imagine the first viewing. As the film started, I thought I was seeing a ROGER RABBIT short as a warm-up to the main event. I don't remember ever seeing a Roger Rabbit cartoon when I was growing up, but I thought What the heck? Even if it's new, it should be pretty good. Well, about five minutes into this little short, a director yells, CUT! and this little cartoon character in diapers yells, WHAT THE HELL WAS WRONG WITH THAT TAKE! On first viewing, this was a little jarring, seeing this cartoon in diapers using rather racy language. On subsequent viewings, it was something innovative and a little cutting edge. This was the first cartoon I ever saw that was geared more toward adults.Animation with live action was nothing new, even in 1988, (SONG OF THE SOUTH, MARY POPPINS, AND PETE'S DRAGON anyone?) but the interaction between the cartoon characters and their live counterparts never looked so natural. Even in the more physical parts like when Baby Herman whacked his secretary on the fanny and Eddie grabbed Roger by the ears, dunked him in the sink, and slapped the handcuffs on him was pure genius. My hat's off to the actors and the film editors for this. It was very impressive. (Also the part where the gorilla bouncers threw Eddie out of the night club was very well done as well.) This movie told a good story as well and didn't just rely on gimmicks like a lot of films of this nature do. It was a standard noir detective story, very much like the time period it was set in. But I think this is the first time a toon was ever accused of murder. And Jessica was very sexy looking for a cartoon. How about Betty Boop being out of work because cartoons went to color? There are some really wonderful things in this movie.The video I got less than a year later was always a favorite whenever we had adult parties or sleepovers for kids. People of all ages loved this movie. And Bos Hoskins (hope I got that name right) did a wonderful job with his California accent. I would never have known he was British if I hadn't researched him on this site. And it's hard for me to think of Christopher Lloyd as anyone but eccentric but likable Doc Brown in BACK TO THE FUTURE. He did a great job playing mean old Judge Doom.

It's a masterpiece. It's brilliant. I loved every minute of it. From one of the best title sequences ever made to the ending. First of all, this is not a CGI blockbuster.

I love the idea! it's original and the story is more about the family and what they are going through.The film's score is great! This is probably James Newton Howard's best work he has ever done! The music provides something mysterious and obviously give homages to Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Psycho. I also love the simplicity of the film. There's nothing too complex right here.

Thompson, the writer of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, was a man whose perspective on life oozed from a pen filled with ink from other dimensions.Thompson made a following in the 1960's and 1970's with a two-fold avant-garde approach to journalism. Well, avant-garde  is almost too tame a word. His style was the journalistic equivalent to Salvadore Dali or Thomas Pynchon where reality and surrealism become very reluctant bedfellows in a world that seems to have gone mad--or maybe it never really was sane to begin with. The other aspect in addition to Thompson's warped view of the world is his habit of engaging in the lovingly coined term Gonzo Journalism. For those unfamiliar with it, Gonzo Journalism refers to an approach to reporting in which the reporter and\/or journalist becomes as important to (or more important than) the story itself, in a kind of self-aggrandizement in which the story and reporter literally become one. And Thompson was, for almost five decades, the quintessential Gonzo journalist. He is sometimes referred to as Dr Gonzo.As Gonzo journalism is definitely not for all readers, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is definitely not for all movie-goers. If you're shopping for a film to re-affirm certain steadfast precepts of logic, love, ethics, and morality, then your movie-buying dollar needs to be invested elsewhere. But if you're willing to forgo any predetermined expectations about how and what a movie should be, you're in for one hell of a ride. Fear and Loathing is a roller coaster from which you never seem to be able to get off.The story surrounds a semi-fictional character, Raoul Duke, played brilliantly by Johnny Depp in a role that even the most daring of actors would avoid at all costs. The only other actor brave or foolish enough to step into the twisted world of Thompson was Bill Murray in Where the Buffalo Roam. The difference between Raoul Duke and Hunter Thompson is mainly the spelling. The character is still replete with Thompson's trademark long cigarette, California drawl, and a personality that is at once maddeningly low-key and as deranged as Dracula on speed. The Raoul Duke aka Hunter Thompson character is the type of person you might want to at first avoid by running into the nearest coat closet before peeking your head out to see what this space alien masquerading as a human being will do next. And Raoul Duke goes on this adventure with a side-kick known sometimes as his attorney and also as Dr Gonzo.The setting for the misadventures of these two interplanetary refugees couldn't be more perfect. Space Alien and his side-kick Godzilla go on a drug-infested trip to the loony-bin surreal capital of the US of A Las Vegas. Duke is supposed to be covering a motorcycle race for the incomparable Sports Illustrated and gets sidetracked by the amusement park that is the Disneyland for adults. The road trip begins on the infamous two-lane highway between Los Angeles and Las Vegas in a 1960's convertible that has seen better days--and better owners. Even before they arrive in neon-ville, Depp sees bats all over the sky, but becomes concerned when his partner fails to see them also. He wonders that his partner may be losing it when he doesn't see the bats that Depp does. During the trip (and the trip) these two maniacs enter Vegas and see strange creatures in and out of hotels, casinos, bars, and even on the race track. And people in particular sometimes show up as reptilian creatures looking to devour Raoul Duke and Dr Gonzo.The result is a kind of endless romp through an amusement park from Hell that never lets up. At one point the drugs have so twisted all of their perceptions of reality that the world has become somewhat akin to the hideout of the Joker in the old Batman TV series from the 1960's, you know where the floor is always slanted to the side. This is the Hunter Thompson world to a tee faithfully executed by probably the only other entity on the planet twisted enough himself to bring this mayhem to the screen Terry Guilliam of Monty Python fame. (He was the originator of the mad cartoons that combined European Renaissance art with the Python surrealist sensibility between sketches.) The story is a mosaic of drug-inducements that nearly drive the characters insane. I mean, is Las Vegas only the most inane choice of a location to engage in an intense drug-fest? Some have criticized this movie as advocating and glorifying psychedelic drugs, but I disagree. By movie's end I felt there was a reason I don't personally engage in these kinds of trips. Maybe the world is mad enough as it is without using artificial means to make it seem even more insane.

In Agnes of God, she delivers on a very personal level, portraying a character very close to herself and bringing passion to the screen. She is also, in her early fifties, looking so loin-scorchingly beautiful that I could hardly restrain myself at times. Despite her wardrobe, depicting a woman who doesn't care to exhibit so loudly her heart-poundingly, blood-throbbingly luscious body, she magnetizes any heterosexual libido watching this film. Now that that's been made clear, I'll return to more practical comments upon this movie.Meg Tilly makes you wonder why her sister is more popular and still working these days. She is haunting as a nun who in mind and spirit is still a naive and innocent little girl, overloaded with imagination and shame for every presentation of any of the realities of being a woman. Each actress in the film matches the other, but only Tilly disturbs us and rocks our emotions.Anne Bancroft, in maybe her best performance short of The Graduate, is wonderful because of how realistic her character is, the sad woman whose present situation brings peace but does not hinder the edge she's developed from life. Her scenes with Fonda are riveting, despite the stage-like speed at which they exchange dialogue which hardly has the effect on screen as it would in the original play. The two actresses develop a swaying arch that lasts throughout the movie, as they meet, and no matter how much they disagree and fight, can still find that one moment in the gazebo where they can connect on a relatively comfortable level. They only hate each other because of what the other represents to the other's desperately fixed opinion, and if things were different, they could get along just like anyone else. I'm not sure if I've ever seen a relationship like that done so well and so clearly in a movie before. It's a rare and odd sort of occurrence and in life that isn't often recognized, and those two actresses performed it with the sharp perception that makes them two of the greatest actresses of the 1960s through the '80s.Agnes of God is directed by Norman Jewison with a sort of effect that films rarely live up to. I don't know if I would call it one of my favorite films, but I would call it a film that sets a perfect example of effective, atmospheric, emotional film-making. Jewison's use of director of photography Sven Nykvist, of Ingmar Bergman fame, gives the film the visual moods it has that Jewison subtly projects on us. Every prop, setting, and landscape is old, almost antique-like, and therein lies feeling and atmosphere. There's a sense of history that is never spoken of. Georges Delerue's music is so packed with weeping, heart-sinking emotion that because of it, tears will strain your eyes. The film is so subtle in its workings, especially on Jewison's handling of the cinematography and music. The music will slowly sneak into a scene and you will hardly notice it's entrance, and it will pack a scene with tension or passion or even fear in any combination of warmth, sneakiness, and atmosphere. The film entrances you because of these subtleties. Jewison will focus so deeply on one setting that it's an entire universe for us, and when a new scene takes place somewhere else, it's jolting. What a sad, powerful, atmospheric film. I cried so hard.

This is a great telling of the many possible stories about the immigrant farmworker population that came to Hawai'i to work the sugar plantations in the early 1900's. My grandparents were part of that migration; my parents were born on a Kohala plantation (Big Island) at the time setting of the movie. I moved to the Big Island over a year ago after living in California for over 30 years. I was surprised to see that many of the former cane growing lands are still undeveloped, with wild cane still growing, years after the plantations closed. I've heard many stories from my aunts and uncles who were kids growing up on the plantation. This movie helps to image those kinds of stories and memories. This story is more of an historical document than a romantic plot-driven movie. It leaves me shaking my head to read a review like ccthemovieman's. Some people just don't get it.I didn't recall that Youki Kudoh had the starring role, with which she did an incredible job. I recall her great performances in Jim Jarmusch's Mystery Train and in an Australian film, co- starring with Russell Crowe, Heaven's Burning. Tamlyn Tomita did a great job with her pidgin English, especially for someone who didn't grow up in the Islands. I had forgotten that Toshiro Mifune had a cameo role as the moving picture show narrator. And I missed the fact that Jason Scott Lee had an uncredited, non-speaking part as one of the plantation workers during the payday scene. I was saddened to find out that the director and co-writer, Kayo Hatta, died in an accidental drowning in 2005. There are two other excellent foreign films that mirror this cane plantation experience Gaijin about the immigrant cane workers in Brazil (many of them Japanese) in the same time period; and Sugar Cane Alley about the cane plantation experience in Africa. The latter is still available, but Gaijin, sadly, doesn't appear to have been shown in quite a while. Another great film about the early Asian in America experience when immigrants were more like slaves is A Thousand Pieces of Gold. This was set over the Chinese workers' involvement in the building of the railroad, starred Rosalind Chao, Chris Cooper, Michael Paul Chan, and Dennis Dun.

This is a great telling of the many possible stories about the immigrant farmworker population that came to Hawai'i to work the sugar plantations in the early 1900's. My grandparents were part of that migration; my parents were born on a Kohala plantation (Big Island) at the time setting of the movie. I moved to the Big Island over a year ago after living in California for over 30 years. I was surprised to see that many of the former cane growing lands are still undeveloped, with wild cane still growing, years after the plantations closed. I've heard many stories from my aunts and uncles who were kids growing up on the plantation. This movie helps to image those kinds of stories and memories. This story is more of an historical document than a romantic plot-driven movie. It leaves me shaking my head to read a review like ccthemovieman's. Some people just don't get it.I didn't recall that Youki Kudoh had the starring role, with which she did an incredible job. I recall her great performances in Jim Jarmusch's Mystery Train and in an Australian film, co- starring with Russell Crowe, Heaven's Burning. Tamlyn Tomita did a great job with her pidgin English, especially for someone who didn't grow up in the Islands. I had forgotten that Toshiro Mifune had a cameo role as the moving picture show narrator. And I missed the fact that Jason Scott Lee had an uncredited, non-speaking part as one of the plantation workers during the payday scene.

Arlington Road keeps you glued to your seat as Faraday learns about Lang's history, and what he seems to be plotting. The tension mounts when Faraday's family comes under attack, but then it falls apart at the very end. At the end of the film you are supposed to believe that Faraday was being played like a puppet on a string for the entire movie, and that pretty much all of the events were carefully orchestrated by Lang. Frankly, this is totally unbelievable. Lang drops one or two hints that propel Faraday in a particular direction, but other than that the conspiracy depends entirely on Faraday to make a series of very specific decisions that he could have just as easily not made. Alternatively, there are a host of other characters that advance the plot that were not being affected or influenced by Lang at all. Instead of looking like a conspiracy, the whole thing looks like a coincidence.Lastly, the movie is simply not good enough to merit a tragic ending. A tragic ending can be really effective when the hero's death is sacrificial towards some greater good (Braveheart). Not the case here. The Sixth Sense and Fallen both had great tragic endings, but the heroes' deaths were both critical to the twists and the plots were both bullet-proof.

He wants to move the viewers, rather than arouse them. That sequence neatly sums up what Paul Thomas Anderson has achieved with his second feature, the stunning, oddly heartbreaking Boogie Nights.Set between 1977 and 1984, the picture tells us how lives can change thanks to the adult film industry it is the golden years of porn cinema, and Jack Horner is the most successful filmmaker in that sector. He gets particularly lucky when he meets Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg), a 17-year old waiter with an unusually large manhood. After a night of drinks and sex in Jack's house, the young man happily accepts to become his new star, and the results show pretty quickly Dirk Diggler, as he is now known, is the hottest name in the business, which means he can get whatever he wants, whether it's a fast car, nice clothes, ladies or drugs.Such happiness, however, is not meant to last being a porn star might change your life, but change does not necessarily mean improve.

But the biggest liability is Dirk filled with drugs and having an ego the size of his torpedo (It's my big d*ck and I say when we roll!), he and his partner Reed Rothchild (John C.

But what impresses the most is how he succeeds in getting a touching story out of an unconventional subject rather than offering a two-hour montage of explicit sex (there are only two such scenes in the entire film) he focuses on the people involved in the making of this kind of flicks, with particular attention to how their lives are affected by what they do.

Some think that the film is manipulative and implausible, while others are awestruck and incredibly moved. When I first saw it, I had practically no knowledge of what the film was about and had virtually no preconceived ideas. When the film was over, I was not only fascinated, but stunned for days afterward. Dancer in the Dark is a film that has affected me more than anything else I have ever seen. What Lars Von Trier has created is the greatest example of on-screen emotion ever.The central character is Selma, played by Bjork in the role she was born for. Selma is a single mother from Czechoslovakia who has migrated to America with her young son, Gene. They both have a genetic disorder that will eventually cause blindness, and Selma is working herself into the ground to save money to organise an operation to save Gene's eyesight. When things get too much for Selma, she incorporates herself and her surroundings into daydreams of Hollywood musicals, which is her way of coping with her circumstances. Selma's landlord Bill is going broke and is afraid his marriage will be threatened if his wife Linda was to find out. He confides in Selma and, when they have both exchanged their secrets, Bill starts to get ideas of borrowing the money from Selma, which brings about serious repercussions.Dancer in the Dark is absorbing, ambitious, beautiful and emotionally assaulting. It is a very artistic and pure film. It is so unconventional from other films, and is therefore not very popular. It is filmed using the Dogma 95 guidelines, which were established in Europe. These guidelines focus on making films in a relatively basic way. Hand-held cameras, natural lighting and shooting on location instead of using sets, are a few examples of the criteria. This technique is not something every audience will accept. A good deal of viewers will be put off by the sometimes chaotic camera-work and jumpy editing. But for those who can see it as an art form, it is a very welcomed style.This is certainly a film that deserves more recognition. Fans have heaped praise on it, but it seems in some ways, the film has almost been forgotten about. Even taking into consideration that the film may not be a hit with mass audiences, it's difficult to believe that this film is not available everywhere. But whether you love or hate it, it's boldness and originality cannot be denied. Lars von Trier is a director that is to be applauded. He is not afraid to be different, and Dancer in the Dark is impossible to forget.Bjork is a woman of incredible talent, and she is absolutely amazing as Selma and deserves all the praise she has been given. Lars von Trier and Bjork did however, clash during production, and the disagreements did take their toll, as some of the musical scenes let the film down slightly. But overall, the film is an overwhelming knockout. It is the kind of film that could make almost anyone cry like a baby. Oddly enough, my first response to the film was not tears. Though I felt almost traumatised and wondered how I managed to sit through it, I just didn't cry. The tears did come however, on repeated viewings.If you love art house films or are looking for something that is out of the ordinary, Dancer in the Dark is worth watching.

Selma is a single mother from Czechoslovakia who has migrated to America with her young son, Gene. They both have a genetic disorder that will eventually cause blindness, and Selma is working herself into the ground to save money to organise an operation to save Gene's eyesight. When things get too much for Selma, she incorporates herself and her surroundings into daydreams of Hollywood musicals, which is her way of coping with her circumstances. Selma's landlord Bill is going broke and is afraid his marriage will be threatened if his wife Linda was to find out. He confides in Selma and, when they have both exchanged their secrets, Bill starts to get ideas of borrowing the money from Selma, which brings about serious repercussions.Dancer in the Dark is absorbing, ambitious, beautiful and emotionally assaulting. It is a very artistic and pure film. It is so unconventional from other films, and is therefore not very popular. It is filmed using the Dogma 95 guidelines, which were established in Europe. These guidelines focus on making films in a relatively basic way. Hand-held cameras, natural lighting and shooting on location instead of using sets, are a few examples of the criteria. This technique is not something every audience will accept. A good deal of viewers will be put off by the sometimes chaotic camera-work and jumpy editing. But for those who can see it as an art form, it is a very welcomed style.This is certainly a film that deserves more recognition. Fans have heaped praise on it, but it seems in some ways, the film has almost been forgotten about. Even taking into consideration that the film may not be a hit with mass audiences, it's difficult to believe that this film is not available everywhere. But whether you love or hate it, it's boldness and originality cannot be denied. Lars von Trier is a director that is to be applauded. He is not afraid to be different, and Dancer in the Dark is impossible to forget.Bjork is a woman of incredible talent, and she is absolutely amazing as Selma and deserves all the praise she has been given. Lars von Trier and Bjork did however, clash during production, and the disagreements did take their toll, as some of the musical scenes let the film down slightly. But overall, the film is an overwhelming knockout. It is the kind of film that could make almost anyone cry like a baby. Oddly enough, my first response to the film was not tears. Though I felt almost traumatised and wondered how I managed to sit through it, I just didn't cry. The tears did come however, on repeated viewings.If you love art house films or are looking for something that is out of the ordinary, Dancer in the Dark is worth watching. As upsetting and unpleasant as it is at times, it is a film that should be seen, if you can handle it.

When watching this movie, you must remove all serious films about serial killers from your mind because American Psycho is a parody of horror movies and a satire about the materialism and shallowness of America during the 1980s. If you can view this as a very dark comedy, it works. Patrick Bateman is a blank slate of a human being who puts on the mask of being the modern male. He displays all the trappings of what constitutes the successful male in our society lots of money, lots of women, lots of partying, and lots of toys (i.e., for the '80s, his Walkman, CDs, and, of course, video tapes.) But all the successful male trappings are only Patrick's outfit he wears in society to fit in. The shiny superficiality is reflected in the immaculate white and stainless steel décor of his apartment. The only thing that that makes him human ultimately is his blood lust. When committing his horrendous acts, he breaks through the shiny exterior to the meat and bones of it all where the deeper meaning might lie&#151;that is why when Patrick murders Paul Allen, it so disturbingly satisfying and amusing. After Patrick is done hacking up fellow stockbroker\/nemesis Paul Allen (Jared Leto) who keeps confusing him with another stockbroker, he turns, and one side of his face is covered with blood, and the other is not, so you finally see the two sides of Patrick&#151;a human with some complexity. With all the mistaken identity in the movie among the stockbrokers in their accepted uniform of identical designer haircuts, glasses, suits , and not to mention business cards, Patrick commits suicide in a sense with Paul Allen--murdering himself, and all the artificiality of his lifestyle. As for the anti-feminist, misogynist criticism that both the book and film received, having Mary Harron as director does bring more of a female sensibility to American Psycho. I don't think a male director could have objectified Christian Bale's body as beautifully as Harron did, especially in the shower and chainsaw scenes. If you look at the female characters, they are quite lost, and that is a commentary on society. Courtney Rawlinson (Samantha Mathis), Patrick's mistress, is a high society girl whose only function in life is to take pharmaceutical drugs, and Evelyn Williams (Reese Witherspoon), Patrick's fiancée, is a rich Daddy's girl whose only function in life is to shop. On the DVD there is a hilarious deleted scene in which Patrick and Evelyn are in bed, and Patrick strides on top of her, unzipping his pants, while Evelyn looks away at the TV and tries to watch the Home Shopping Network; then she looks up and deadpans, What you want me to do with that? Floss with it. The most disturbing scenes to me are when Patrick kills the homeless man, the dog and Christie the street prostitute. The homeless man scene is pure camp as Patrick tells him that they have nothing in common. As for the stomping of the dog, it is all implied with sound effects. For a movie that is considered so violent, much of the violence is implied and left up to the mind of the viewers. The chainsaw scene is where the movie uses every cliché in the scary movie business the madman chasing the woman in jeopardy and bloody corpses popping out of closets. As Patrick wields his chainsaw towards Christie, it becomes more phallic&#151;the chainsaw, the nail gun are all just extensions of his penis, an ironic sign of both power and insecurity. As Christie runs down the stairs, from a top Patrick positions the chainsaws and flings it down the stairwell with perfect aim, piercing her body. After that Patrick becomes an unreliable narrator in the movie, and you wonder if this is real. For some reason, the image of Christie pierced with a chainsaw reminds me of the infamous Hustler cover of the woman being fed through the meat grinder&#151;a much referred to image by outraged feminists. But as disturbing as both scenes are, both are crucial to the movie's point of being a dark comedy and parody. Christian Bale (Batman Begins, The Prestige, The New World) will always be remembered for his role of Patrick Bateman. He eats the camera here&#151;although not literally! Some have thought his acting to be exaggerated, but that is the point Bale plays someone who must act through his life to achieve his goal of fitting in. Bale's performance also gives a bit of humanity to Patrick, especially during the scene where Jean (Chloe Sevigny), his secretary, is at his apartment. Bale acts charming to Sevigny's obliviousness all the while he looks in his kitchen cabinets full of murdering tools. He aims a nail gun behind Sevigny unbeknownst to her. A comical misunderstanding happens between them as Jean thinks that getting hurt by Patrick would be by having an affair with him while he knows that it would be killing her. Sadness washes over Bale's face as he tells her that she better go, and, for a second, you see a real person. American Psycho will not be for everyone, and the ending is cryptic. It doesn't romanticize the '80s, but it captures some of the ugliness of it. The soundtrack is pure guilty pleasure with Katrina and the Waves,Simply Red, The Information Society, New Order, Phil Collins, and Huey Lewis and the News. Bateman spews out little interesting, if somewhat pathetic reviews of these musicians and songs to his victims beforehand. You'll never hear Hip to be Square or Sussudio in same way again after watching this movie.

It has been stated that the amount of controversy this film has caused, amounts to more than all of the controversy of Stanley Kubrick's other films combined. I have to agree with that. The film has been accused of inspiring real life crimes, (of which some claims are undeniably true), and Stanley Kubrick and his family were hit with death threats upon it's release. The film was soon withdrawn from viewing in England, and that stayed in effect for about thirty years. This amazingly deep film has been praised, despised and in some cases been thoroughly misunderstood.The film takes place sometime in the near future, in which society has become completely morally corrupt. The central character is a sadistic teenage gang leader called Alex who, along with his 'droogs', commits violent crimes on other citizens, purely for the fun of it. When Alex accidentally murders a woman, he is imprisoned and used as a test subject for the latest method of criminal reform therapy, which guarantees to render criminals as harmless to society. After the therapy backfires, the political party responsible attempts to cover their tracks.'A Clockwork Orange' has excellent performances, a complex script, and many important themes that it explores. Alex is one of the most nihilistic characters ever to appear on the screen. We know how repulsive his actions are, and yet disturbingly, there is an element of likability about him. A tricky combination to perform, but Malcolm McDowell manages to do it. After an insight into Alex's evil mind, Stanley Kubrick brilliantly flips the film around and throws a strong anti-violence message at the audience. This is an important moment as it explains why the horrific scenes of vulgarity have taken place in the film so far. This scene is one of the ultimate director's traps as it confronts viewers who have enjoyed the scenes of violence by making it clear that Alex, (and by extension, anyone else who can see a reflection of themselves in him) is in a corrupted and unhealthy state.Ultimately, 'A Clockwork Orange' is an extremely dark study of the worst traits and instincts of human nature. It is clear that Stanley Kubrick's outlook on people is very bleak as there is hardly a character with any redeeming features. Obviously, he was concerned about what the state of society would be like in years to come, and in some ways, it's turned out to be the way the film presents it.This is a brilliant, but risky film to have made. Brilliant in the way it deals with so many themes (the film could be analysed exhaustibly) and the very important statements that it makes.

The amoral nature of the film serves to make some strong points, and should disturb it's viewers.One of the most remarkable things about Stanley Kubrick's films is the way they never date and are more relevant as time goes on, and 'A Clockwork Orange' is a prime example.

It has been stated that the amount of controversy this film has caused, amounts to more than all of the controversy of Stanley Kubrick's other films combined. I have to agree with that. The film has been accused of inspiring real life crimes, (of which some claims are undeniably true), and Stanley Kubrick and his family were hit with death threats upon it's release. The film was soon withdrawn from viewing in England, and that stayed in effect for about thirty years. This amazingly deep film has been praised, despised and in some cases been thoroughly misunderstood.The film takes place sometime in the near future, in which society has become completely morally corrupt. The central character is a sadistic teenage gang leader called Alex who, along with his 'droogs', commits violent crimes on other citizens, purely for the fun of it. When Alex accidentally murders a woman, he is imprisoned and used as a test subject for the latest method of criminal reform therapy, which guarantees to render criminals as harmless to society. After the therapy backfires, the political party responsible attempts to cover their tracks.'A Clockwork Orange' has excellent performances, a complex script, and many important themes that it explores. Alex is one of the most nihilistic characters ever to appear on the screen. We know how repulsive his actions are, and yet disturbingly, there is an element of likability about him. A tricky combination to perform, but Malcolm McDowell manages to do it. After an insight into Alex's evil mind, Stanley Kubrick brilliantly flips the film around and throws a strong anti-violence message at the audience. This is an important moment as it explains why the horrific scenes of vulgarity have taken place in the film so far. This scene is one of the ultimate director's traps as it confronts viewers who have enjoyed the scenes of violence by making it clear that Alex, (and by extension, anyone else who can see a reflection of themselves in him) is in a corrupted and unhealthy state.Ultimately, 'A Clockwork Orange' is an extremely dark study of the worst traits and instincts of human nature. It is clear that Stanley Kubrick's outlook on people is very bleak as there is hardly a character with any redeeming features. Obviously, he was concerned about what the state of society would be like in years to come, and in some ways, it's turned out to be the way the film presents it.This is a brilliant, but risky film to have made. Brilliant in the way it deals with so many themes (the film could be analysed exhaustibly) and the very important statements that it makes. The film is risky in the sense that it features heavy subject matter that too many people misinterpret. As mentioned before, on the film's release some even went to the extreme of committing crimes that were inspired by scenes in the film. The messages in the film were obviously lost on those viewers, and I would imagine that some fans today also miss the point and watch 'A Clockwork Orange' purely for its violence and other off-putting content. The amoral nature of the film serves to make some strong points, and should disturb it's viewers.One of the most remarkable things about Stanley Kubrick's films is the way they never date and are more relevant as time goes on, and 'A Clockwork Orange' is a prime example.

The original was an immensely enjoyable action spectacle. While the sequel lacked its predecessors intelligence, it was fast-paced and entertaining. By contrast, this latest effort is a tiresome, chaotic waste. Part of the problem is that the plot was reportedly taken from other sources and usurped by the Die Hard franchise and the shoe-horning shows. Does anyone buy for a moment that the married couple we watched in the first two films has inexplicably separated again and the heroic McClane (Bruce Willis) has turned into a washed-up embittered old drunk? The film makes a major misstep out of the starting gate by presenting a character that we are familiar with from two prior films and depicting him in a way and in a state that makes little narrative sense. The plot (such as it is) also relies heavily on coincidence, illogic motivation and general stupidity. The villain is played by Oscar-winner Jeremy Irons, who is purportedly the brother of the Alan Rickman character from the original, and who turns in a performance so dreadful it must be seen to be believed. He drops clues to various traps\/bombs around NYC and has McClane and the police running frantically all over the place. In the absence of the reliable Bonnie Bedelia and Reginald Veljohnson, the plot rather incoherently conspires a reason to throw together the belabored Willis with an African-American shop owner, played by Samuel L. Jackson. Rather than amusing banter a la Lethal Weapon, we get two characters, particularly in Jackson's case, who seem to actively despise each other for the duration of the film. Worse, Jackson is portrayed as an over-the-top racist\/bigot, who can barely make it through any scene without some raging anti-white sentiment amidst a flurry of foul language being unleashed. It is wearisome enough that the filmmakers actually seem to think this should be funny, but even worse it shows Jackson schooling his grandchildren in this same sort of vile outlook and tries to play it for cheap laughs. Of course, then this is used as the set-up for a predictably lazy action sequence later on which firmly highlights the film's total lack of originality. When it becomes apparent that a school is one of Irons' bombing targets, it is a foregone conclusion that the following will fall into place a) it will be the school attended by Jackson's grandchildren, and b) there will be some ludicrous cockamamie reason why the grandchildren will be the only ones not evacuated from the school forcing a dire rescue attempt. Interestingly, the prior films in the series did provide a colorful cast of supporting characters to help\/hinder the hero in his venture. Not so here, where the supporting cast is relatively interchangeable and instantly forgettable. The action sequences are utterly devoid of any tension or excitement, and the finale pretty much sputters out like a match in the wind. One can only hope that more than a decade has given the filmmakers some insight in which to improve the upcoming sequel from the debacle they hit with this one.

Fritz Lang's vision of an apocalyptic future, is one of the best examples of cinematic art in existence. Time has done nothing to reduce the film's impact. It is probably the most electrifying film to date.The story is set in 2026, in a time where society has split into two classes. The workers, who simply exist below ground level, keeping the city functioning, and the rulers of the city and the upper-class citizens who live in luxury above. The ruler's son, Freder, while indulging at the 'Club of the Sons', is curious when a woman from down below visits, surrounded by a group of young boys. It is at this moment that Freder is moved to visit the worker's environment. He tells his father of the distress that he finds and eventually becomes part of a rebellion that will finally unite both classes.What Fritz Lang created in 1926 is truly incredible. It is mind-boggling at how modern it still is. And as far as art is concerned, this is a film that is bursting at the seams.
