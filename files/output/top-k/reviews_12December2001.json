And it did that. If you happened to be upstairs at my house during the movie, you could feel the floor shake!!  The story itself is fine, a divorced couple (Tea Leoni and William Macy) reunite and pretend to be wealthy adventurers to convince Dr Alan Grant (Sam Neil) to give them a guided tour by low-flying plane of the island with the dinosaurs. However, their real goal is to land and try and find their young son who was lost there 8 weeks earlier in a parasailing incident. They land, but crash upon takeoff, trying to evade a T-Rex.That all happens quickly, and the rest of the film is to see if they can avoid being eaten, see if they can find their son, and see if they can somehow make it to the ocean. Not everyone survives, but the 5 principal characters do. This Jurassic Park film introduces several new dinosaurs, and the Raptors are smart enough to plan and communicate with each other. We see flying dinos for the first time.The film doesn't take itself too seriously, and I don't think we the viewing audience should take it seriously either.  After all, we know that having an island of dinosaurs in 2000 is impossible, so the whole thing is just a big fantasy. Retrieving the cell phone in a pile of dino dung!  Doc saying, OK, no one move a muscle, the dino roars, then everyone behind him turn and run. Macy looking for change for the abandoned vending machines, while someone else kicks the glass in and takes what he wants. A number of light moments among the carnage.The DVD allows you to select either a Dolby 5.1 or a DTS 5.1 soundtrack. As I have found almost uniformly with other DVDs, the Dolby track is much more aggressive in the subwoofer channel. In fact, during the dinosaur fight in chapter 6, the sound levels at my listening position often got as high as 92 to 95 dB, and the subwoofer bottomed a number of times.  The same chapter in DTS, at the same receiver volume setting, had peak volume levels of about 88 to 90 dB. This means the Dolby track had four times the signal going to the subwoofer. This is too much.  The DTS track sounded more natural.The DVD has a number of interesting extras, the ones I found most interesting were the behind-the-scenes making of footage. Overall a good DVD for an entertaining evening.  However, if you listen to it only on TV speakers, you'll miss 3\/4 of the effect of the film.

The program main control is designed to basically break into systems\/hack if you will\/ and steal information to make itself better. Now Flynn is not happy for having his programs stolen by Dillenger and losing his job so he starts doing some hacking of his own to gain evidence against Dillenger.

It just concentrates on telling a story well, rightly assuming that this alone will be enough to provoke audience thought.  As a result, it's not an 'issue' movie, it's a movie that anyone can enjoy, which just happens to have autism as one of its topics.  Make no mistake, Charlie Babbitt is an emotionless illegitimate child at the film's opening, but Cruise's magnetic performance keeps the audience from becoming totally alienated.  It may be true that Hoffman's performance can be put purely down to imitation, but boy is he convincing as Raymond Babbitt, Charlie's long-lost autistic older brother.   I know, it sounds like the perfect recipe for standard Hollywood mushiness; but Barry Levinson's opus manages to sidestep that possible pitfall by virtue of being an amalgamation of several different film genres over the course of its running time.  The film is always interesting to watch because the characters are so well drawn, and if you watch it for the first time, you never know where the narrative is going to take them.

First, there's the argument with the gay gentleman played by the brilliant Michael Caine, in which she replies, You have no idea why I am the way I am. Well, it seemed fairly obvious to me. There seemed to be a chemistry between she and Rhode Island pageant woman. I didn't see much chemistry between the other FBI officer at all. Miss California jumps out of the finals yelling that if a lesbian can make it to the top ten in a pageant, we can do anything. Gracie cheers her on.She doesn't seem just Tomboyish. Gracie's character seemed more butch than anything. She hits like a man, she has table manners like one. She seems very masculine in this role, as was intended, but they seem to give you the idea throughout that there is more of a reason to that. They never give a reason when she claims, You have no idea why I am the way I am.. and it just seems off that they would never answer it when that's one of the bigger questions in the story.Now, I liked the film, I did. It was cute and funny, Bullock was great with her facial expressions. However, it just seems like they lead up to something that in the end, they rushed to make it over again. I got the impression they were intending to have her as a lesbian, and then were instructed by the studio execs to make it straight.Maybe I'm reading a little too much into this film, but watch and see for those little hints they drop throughout the story. I think you'll probably agree.Aside from feeling like the ending was disjointed and didn't work with the rest of the story (on the romantic level) the story is still adorable, Bill Shatner is still adorable, Bullock as always steals the show with her presence. See it! But watch for that, and I think you'll agree.But I can't shake the feeling that I saw the wrong ending.....

The intense violence, the macho presence of the 7, the quasi absence of any female lead, and especially the setting (a Mexican pueblo!) were definitely not ingredients of the romantic American Western.And for this alone the film deserves some recognition, for being ahead of its time, so to speak.  The basic plot is not particularly intense a Mexican town is constantly being robbed of its crop by 40 banditos, led by Calvera. When 3 of the inhabitants decide to rebel, they head to an American town, initially to buy guns. They end up hiring 7 men who decide to support their cause for various individual reasons, but definitely not for the low pay!This Western is not a classic because of the action scenes (which were not that spectacular) but because it focuses on the characters. Each man learns something of value from this mission, and each of them has a haunting past, though we are never told the details.  Chris and Vin are lonely drifters and invincible gunmen with moral principles and a dash of compassion. For instance, in the beginning of the film, they team up to give a Native American a decent burial in a little town's cemetery, despite the locals' strong opposition.  Chris, after siding with the 3 Mexicans's cause, takes the initiative of finding the right men for the job. Bernardo O'Reilly is half-Mexican half-Irish, and he's the one who has a special relationship with the kids of the Mexican village. He is good with the rifle, but doesn't fail to give the children a good lecture on the responsibilities of their fathers. Lee (Robert Vaughn), is a fugitive and is always dressed elegantly, even during combat. I liked Britt's character's best. Played by James Coburn, he is really fast both with a gun and with a knife. Look out for the first scene when we're introduced to his character, where an insisting gunman keeps on provoking him until he gets what he asked for. Never in that scene does Britt lose his cool, taking small &#145;naps' in between provocations. It's a real laugh, that scene! Actually, the first part of the movie, where we are gradually introduced to each of the 7 men, is the best part.  Harry (Brad Dexter), is a strange character; the only reason he goes for the job is that he is convinced, for some reason, that there is gold mine near the Mexican village. Throughout his conversations with the villagers, he keeps on referring to the mine, much to their perplexity and much to Chris' amusement. Then there is Chico (Horst Buchholz), a young, persistent, and proud gunslinger wannabe. He is the only one of the 7 to &#145;win' in the end, as he decides to settle down with a woman in the village.   Other interesting characters were that of Calvera and of the village's Old Man (played by Vladimir Sokoloff). Calvera is a proud bandito who keeps his word (surprisingly!), and the Old Man is a wise, courageous, and respected figure in the village.  `You hear that, Sotero?

Last year he directed the most whimsical film which was also one of the best movies ever made, (ALMOST FAMOUS).  Now he's directed one of the most thought provoking films ever made, which could also just as well be one of the best films this year, VANILLA SKY.  This is a film that will have you think about what you just saw and the more you take the film apart, the more meaning there is behind the film.  This isn't the same style of Cameron Crowe who directed the crowd pleasing, JERRY MAGUIRE.  This is more like the nightmare of Jerry Maguire.      David Aames (Tom Cruise) ownes 51% of a major magazine publishing company, that he inherited from his father.  The other 49% of the company is owned and runed by the seven board members of the company, which David likes to call the Seven Dwarfs.  He is despised by the members as being another rich kid who got daddy's business which has David feel that he is the victim of a conspiracy.  But outside of work, David is flirtatious, he is having an affair with a stunning blonde named Julie (Cameron Diaz).  David feels only lust for Julie, no love.  It isn't until David's best friend, Brian Shelby (Jason Lee) introduces David to Sofia Serrano (Penelope Cruz), that David begins to feel different.  David is attracted to Sofia, but he feels different, he is in love with Sofia, not lust.  And this leads David to realize that Sofia is changing his life, and for the first time in his life, from the flirting with Julie and the pressures at work, David feels great.  Julie sees David is attracted to Sofia and is jealous, she feels that David violated her by treating her like a sex object.  While David is at his peak, Julie is at her downfall, which leads to Julie crashing her car off a bridge with her and David in it.        When David wakes up from his coma after several months, he is living his nightmare.  He is being charged for murder, he is incarcerated, he's seeking psychatric help from Dr. Curtis McCabe (Kurt Russell), and the worst thing is that David's face has been disfigured making him from looking handsome to horrifying.  David's worst nightmares are coming true, which causes David to mentally and physically try to bring his life back to the way it was.      VANILLA SKY is a remake of the 1997 film OPEN YOUR EYES.  I haven't seen the original version, but for Crowe's version, it's a very stylish and well made thriller.  Crowe uses his skills to make VANILLA SKY similar to his previous films, with the entertaining dialogue, and excellent romantic chemistry.  You would think that at first VANILLA SKY is another retelling of Crowe's previous work JERRY MAGUIRE.  But then it turns into the darkest of nightmares.  Being disfigured, accussed or murder, the fear of not being in love anymore, being alone, and worst of all, being depressed is the darkest of feelings that any human being could feel.  Crowe makes an impressive turn at turning VANILLA SKY from a cute touch romance, to a intense and depressing thriller.      The acting is brought out the strongest by it's star Tom Cruise.  Unlike the flamboyance of MAGNOLIA, the anger of BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY, and the confused JERRY MAGUIRE, David Aames is in a lot of pain.  Cruise does a outsanding job as the man who is suffering from the car accident and realizes that things can't be the way they were.  I also enjoyed the performance by Kurt Russell, who gives a strong acting performance as the doctor who is looking deep inside Cruise's character to see if he can find the answer causing David's pain.  And the support from Penelope Cruz, Jason Lee, and Cameron Diaz are all also good.  The romantic chemistry between Tom and Penelope is fantastic, you can see how they fell in love with each other in reality.  But it's the Oscar worthy performance by Cruise that helps carry the picture.      I was also strongly pleased with the music soundtrack that Crowe and wife Nancy Wilson put together for the film.  I was amazed to hear the little known gem by the Monkees Porpoise Song (Theme From Head) being played in the movie.  Like HEAD, VANILLA SKY is similar in style by taking the viewer into a trip that is unforgettable.  And other songs by Paul McCartney (doing the title tune), Peter Gabriel, Stereolab, Chemical Brothers, Bob Dylan, and Spiritualized, is a fantastic soundtrack of mixing classic songs from the 60's with the similar style songs of the 21st century.      Then finally there is Cameron Crowe's directing.  He has the viewer keep guessing on what is going on while watching the film until the very end.  It isn't until it's over that you do understand what is going on, and are still amazed by the twist.  And Crowe never does make the film boring, it might be weird or confusing, but never silly or boring.  Crowe also manages to take the film from one mood into another mood without any faults.      VANILLA SKY is a film that won't please the Tom Cruise fans who would like to see him do more films like TOP GUN and DAYS OF THUNDER.  Nope, sorry folks, that Tom Cruise has hopefully passed on, this is the Tom Cruise like EYES WIDE SHUT and MAGNOLLIA, the one who does a level texture role and not just the hero.

David Aames (Tom Cruise) ownes 51% of a major magazine publishing company, that he inherited from his father.  The other 49% of the company is owned and runed by the seven board members of the company, which David likes to call the Seven Dwarfs.  He is despised by the members as being another rich kid who got daddy's business which has David feel that he is the victim of a conspiracy.  But outside of work, David is flirtatious, he is having an affair with a stunning blonde named Julie (Cameron Diaz).  David feels only lust for Julie, no love.  It isn't until David's best friend, Brian Shelby (Jason Lee) introduces David to Sofia Serrano (Penelope Cruz), that David begins to feel different.  David is attracted to Sofia, but he feels different, he is in love with Sofia, not lust.  And this leads David to realize that Sofia is changing his life, and for the first time in his life, from the flirting with Julie and the pressures at work, David feels great.  Julie sees David is attracted to Sofia and is jealous, she feels that David violated her by treating her like a sex object.  While David is at his peak, Julie is at her downfall, which leads to Julie crashing her car off a bridge with her and David in it.        When David wakes up from his coma after several months, he is living his nightmare.  He is being charged for murder, he is incarcerated, he's seeking psychatric help from Dr. Curtis McCabe (Kurt Russell), and the worst thing is that David's face has been disfigured making him from looking handsome to horrifying.  David's worst nightmares are coming true, which causes David to mentally and physically try to bring his life back to the way it was.      VANILLA SKY is a remake of the 1997 film OPEN YOUR EYES.  I haven't seen the original version, but for Crowe's version, it's a very stylish and well made thriller.  Crowe uses his skills to make VANILLA SKY similar to his previous films, with the entertaining dialogue, and excellent romantic chemistry.  You would think that at first VANILLA SKY is another retelling of Crowe's previous work JERRY MAGUIRE.  But then it turns into the darkest of nightmares.  Being disfigured, accussed or murder, the fear of not being in love anymore, being alone, and worst of all, being depressed is the darkest of feelings that any human being could feel.  Crowe makes an impressive turn at turning VANILLA SKY from a cute touch romance, to a intense and depressing thriller.      The acting is brought out the strongest by it's star Tom Cruise.  Unlike the flamboyance of MAGNOLIA, the anger of BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY, and the confused JERRY MAGUIRE, David Aames is in a lot of pain.  Cruise does a outsanding job as the man who is suffering from the car accident and realizes that things can't be the way they were.  I also enjoyed the performance by Kurt Russell, who gives a strong acting performance as the doctor who is looking deep inside Cruise's character to see if he can find the answer causing David's pain.  And the support from Penelope Cruz, Jason Lee, and Cameron Diaz are all also good.  The romantic chemistry between Tom and Penelope is fantastic, you can see how they fell in love with each other in reality.  But it's the Oscar worthy performance by Cruise that helps carry the picture.      I was also strongly pleased with the music soundtrack that Crowe and wife Nancy Wilson put together for the film.  I was amazed to hear the little known gem by the Monkees Porpoise Song (Theme From Head) being played in the movie.  Like HEAD, VANILLA SKY is similar in style by taking the viewer into a trip that is unforgettable.  And other songs by Paul McCartney (doing the title tune), Peter Gabriel, Stereolab, Chemical Brothers, Bob Dylan, and Spiritualized, is a fantastic soundtrack of mixing classic songs from the 60's with the similar style songs of the 21st century.      Then finally there is Cameron Crowe's directing.  He has the viewer keep guessing on what is going on while watching the film until the very end.  It isn't until it's over that you do understand what is going on, and are still amazed by the twist.  And Crowe never does make the film boring, it might be weird or confusing, but never silly or boring.  Crowe also manages to take the film from one mood into another mood without any faults.      VANILLA SKY is a film that won't please the Tom Cruise fans who would like to see him do more films like TOP GUN and DAYS OF THUNDER.  Nope, sorry folks, that Tom Cruise has hopefully passed on, this is the Tom Cruise like EYES WIDE SHUT and MAGNOLLIA, the one who does a level texture role and not just the hero.  VANILLA SKY also proves that Cameron Crowe doesn't have to do only romantic comedies to show that he's a brilliant filmmaker, he can do thrillers with a stroke of genius.  For those who like film with intelligence and wit, then don't miss VANILLA SKY, one of, if not the best film of the year!  ***** (out of five) ","genre":"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"},{"date":"12 December 2001","score":"6 out of 12 people found the following review useful","review":"  I went into this movie with almost no expectations. I had heard much of the negative criticimm of the love story and the director's attempt to create a another Titanic. I think that criticism is a bunch of bull. Titanic had an unbelievable love story set to a historical event. The love story in that movie took away from the integrity of the film-to the point where the viewer HATED both charaters (I personally had no sympathy for Jack). In Pearl Harbor, you are dealing with the reality of war, and what happens when someone is presumed dead. I mean, you can put yourselves in the position of Rafe, Evelyn and Danny. It makes the film more poignant, and the war that much more dramatic. Plus there's not the class-system BS that Cameron tried to push on viewers in Titanic in this movie. The only negative to this movie is that, like Titanic, it could have been an hour shorter. I almost fell asleep the first hour, and it takes about an hour or so to pick up.

Acting is great. The only problem is that, the movie was either on a tight budget or on time contraints.Watching the movie, you can't help but get the feeling that the director is trying to put as many aspects of the original novel into the movie that he doesn't give any of them justice.For instance, Harry's family, they are protrayed sarcastically in the start and then completely forgotten, even Harry doesn't seem to recall they exist.Another example, is this Centaur that jumps in, saves Harry, and leaves. To people who read the novel, they might know who that is and feel empowered by such knowledge.. To the majority that didn't.. They are left feeling that a scene in which the centaur tells Harry who he is should be there.And so the movie goes, after a slow calm start, the movie runs in similar fashion, at first portraying Harry's miserable childhood, and then quickly leaving that and taking you to Hogwarts where the movie portrays the wonders of the school and then leaves them there and shifts focus to the sorcerer's stone and Voldemort. And just when you get emersed into that, the final conflict is quickly upon you and it is one of the weakest final conflicts you have ever seen in a fantasy movie. There is no real battle.. No grand finale, no suspense. Nothing. Just a dead end. Perhaps the Novel had more to offer, but the movie did not, and so a better ending was in order.And so, after leaving the movie, you feel pleased and disappointed. Every rendering of one aspect of Harry's story was accurate, the problem is that the sum of it didn't really fit together well nor did it do the story well. In fact, if there was one theme to the whole movie, it would be the four houses that the apprentices are inducted into. Which is sad because there are greater themes in the novel itself, but this is the only theme that flows through out the movie. Everything else pops in and then quickly pops out again.I think the best solution to this problem would be to make the movie longer.. At least an extra hour of film is missing from this rendition of the Harry Potter stories. This is why I felt the movie was cut short for some reason. Any one can feel it. Every rendering that took place was accurate, but not one rendering gave justice to the original novel.
