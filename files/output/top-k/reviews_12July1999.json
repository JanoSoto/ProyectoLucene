A very well done updating of The Taming of the Shrew by William Shakespeare I feel and I was pleasantly surprised that it didn't contain any sex, language that was too foul, or demeanor that was offensive.  It was a very good way to spend an afternoon and I can hardly wait until it comes out on video.All of the characters were very well written, but I didn't feel one way or the other about Ms. Perky the school councilor.  My favorite character the school bad girl Kat is very well thought out and written.  She's not scarey like the girls in The Craft by comparision.  You wouldn't have to worry about her sacrificing the school mascot but you'd still stay clear of her none the less otherwise you'd catch her wrath.  She's opinionated, doesn't take anything from anyone, still participates in some activities, and is written as a very smart young girl.Each of the characters was written and cast perfectly.  They were each written smart and not typical teen.  Then they were cast correctly as well. Michael the audio\/video nerd and ultimate sidekick to Cameron wasn't in fact a nerd. Bianca the school princess yes was a princess but wasn't stuck up about it other then a few brief glimpses.  Patrick, whose actor was a little too old for the part but none the less well cast, was well written to be a match for Kat.  Under his gruff exterior lied a round about nice guy.  And Joey was so full of himself and had such an ego that it was both belieable and funny to see him strut himself straight out of Bianca's likes and get used without even knowing it.  And good marks to Cameron for liking Bianca for who she is and not what she is or represents.  And also for calling her on the carpet for not wanting to try new things rather then just letting her have her way cause she's a proverbial princess.Well thought-out, well scripted, and well done this film should stand out with die hard teen film fans.  While it won't be remembered as fondly as some of the films that grossed more or had bigger stars, this film is still a hit.  Go see this movie if you haven't already, you won't regret it.Bello ","genre":null},{"date":"12 July 1999","score":"","review":"  I really very much enjoyed this film.  10 Things I Hate About You unfortunately will be lumped in with the slew of teen films already out or coming but this movie will endure I feel where as the others will be forgotten.

We are always trying to make ourselves known to our southern neighbours.  We get upset when they don't know the Canadian national anthem or when they don't know what the capital of Saskatchewan is. And it is this inferiority compex that I believe is at the root of people in this forum that praise this movie like it was the best film ever made. When a lot of Canadians say how wonderful it is, they don't forget to mention the other films that came out last year that were end of the world films. And they say how terrible those films were, how hollow they were, how they were more concerned with the bottom line than to make a meaningful movie that had something to say.  Last Night, paranoid Canadians say, is a film that is so good because there is no special effects and it concentrates on humanity and not the anamoly that is headed towards Earth.  Well let me ask you this.  When did entertainment ever become an evil forum?  When is that films like Armageddon and Deep Impact became the enemy.  And when is it that films were ever made because someone didn't want to turn in a profit?  Do you think there is ever a time when someone says  You know what?  I don't want this film to make any money.  I just want to invest my life savings into this film and have three or four people enjoy it and then I want the guys who financed this to go broke. Folks, movies are a business and that is why Hollywood is as strong as it is and that is why the Canadian film industry is in the shape and state that it is in.  We may tell stories that are interesting and have a point, but ya know what?  They are boring. Most Canadian films are boring.  Armageddon and Deep Impact were fun and entertaining and they followed a formula sure, but when you sat down in the theaters last year and you were in the cool air conditioned theater and you heard Charleton Heston's voice over explaining that  it happened once, it will happen again, it is just a matter of time, didn't you just sit back and say to yourself,  this is going to be fun.   And if you answer no to that question, you are either lying or didn't want to like that film going into it.  It was an exciting film and most of our products are boring. Now I am not saying that's how I felt about Last Night, because I didn't.  But I certainly don't feel that this is the be all to end all to film that most others do.  It is a good film but it is hollow.  And it is so typically Canadian.  When people say that this film was good because there were no special effects and blah blah blah, that is because they can't afford them. And yes that forces people to write a script that is more concerned with how people talk and how they feel and on that level Last Night is fine, it is not great, it is just fine.  It didn't move me and frankly I didn't really think it had much to say.  It was just all right.What I did enjoy was the exploration into some people's lives.  Some were interesting and some were not.  I found the sex addict to be amusing and actually quite real.  His life was devoted to having as much sex as possible before he went out.  And that was interesting.  The guy who wanted to perform his first concert on the night of the end of the world was good as well.  But tell me please, what would anyone be doing at work on this day? And a gas company?  Come on.  That just didn't do it for me.  And why did Cronenburg's character get shot?  For something to do?  For kicks?  Was that the reason?  It just wasn't clear.  You see, to me, if you want to have a film that examines the psychology of humans on the last night of the earth, then you have to have a few characters that are richer than this.  I didn't buy the whole story with Patrick and the Oriental girl.  It felt forced and it's like the script was grasping when it wrote that story line in.  So I guess my problem with the story is that it didn't show enough of what it really would be like.  And it was so damn slow in some areas.  I know it sounds like I really hated this movie, but that is not the case, I am giving it a 7 out of ten, but it is just not the master piece that I think everyone says it is.  Of course that is just my humble opinion and I am obviously in the minority here.  Perhaps I am a product of Hollywood so it clouds my judgement, but there are small films that I can enjoy just as much as the next person, but they have to be from the heart, I didn't feel that in here. It felt close, but in a way, I could feel the paranoia.  And I am Canadian as well, born in Montreal, raised in Windsor and London Ont. and spent a few years in T.O.  So I am as proud a Canadian as they come. And like I said, it is a good film, but ask yourself this, if this was a film done by a smaller American director, perhaps Alan Parker or even someone like John Badham, would you as Canadians think it was as great as you say it is?  Or would you just say,  Yep, not bad, interesting.  And then move on and look forward to the next Will Smith movie to come out?Think about it.

This is a movie that will be remembered for years to come as one of the best tributes to Shakespeare and the artistic process ever made.  Bawdy, hilarious, romantic, and well-made all at once.  The screenplay is absolutely brilliant.  The reenactment of Romeo and Juliet at the end is breathtaking.  I did, in fact, see all of the other nominated Best Actress candidates, and I have to say that Gwyneth was deserving of her award (wish there had been a tie with her and Cate, though).

Here in Japan, some of the highest grossing movies tend to be effects films, sometimes films that don't even have a story. (like the recent Independence Day and Armageddon films.)

The pod races, the big battle between the Gungans and the Droids, the assualt on the Command Ship, we loved them all. Second, I think that I liked the light saber duel between Darth Maul and Jinn and Kenobi. It seemed interesting to me that while in the first Star Wars films, the fights were based either on european fencing (episode 4) or on Japanese kendo (episode 5,6), the fight shown in episode 1 was more like a hong kong action film using kempo or wu-shu. As I am a big fan of Tsui Hark and Jacky Chan films, this was fun for me. However, I was disappointed by the characters. I think that there were too many characters and not enough explanation. As I walk through bookstores here in Fukuoka, Japan, there are entire sections devoted to Star Wars books and periodicals, and some book stores even sell action figures! When I look at these figures, I see that some of the characters barely even appeared in the film!

But was it worth it - YES!  This movie is over two hours long, packed with action, effects, humour, you name it.  Great - or shall we say terrifying? - villain; wonderful, funny heroes, and everybody (even the cat) has character.  The introduction sets the mood so well, I dare say it's one of the best I've seen in a very, very long time.  The effects do not jar, but complement the action beautifully.  The acting is adequate, and everyone seems to be having a good time.  Also, the story is carried through to an ending, and is not dropped halfway as in many other action movies of late (where one feels as if a deadline was reached, and the moviemakers were forced to scramble up a quick ending).Okay, it may not be a classic; we've seen bits of the story before (Indiana Jones springs to mind here, as does Bram Stoker's Dracula) and the lines may be a bit hokey at times. Yet, the pace - once picked up - never drops, masking any glitches in the plot.  With a spectacular show like this, you will not care too much about the story.  This movie does not take itself seriously (thankfully!), and if you let yourself get caught up in the mood, you will leave the theatre with a big smile on your face, and a good, warm feeling inside.

Yet, the pace - once picked up - never drops, masking any glitches in the plot.  With a spectacular show like this, you will not care too much about the story.

If one sees the film nowadays, however,one glaring, seemingly unimportant compromise is obvious----the character Curley's Wife, the only woman in the film---has been given a name...Mae. Steinbeck deliberately leaves her nameless, partly for symbolic value, but also to deliberately and permanently link her with her brutal, stupid, bullying husband. The approach to the story in this version is deliberately pseudopoetic and larger than life---while Aaron Copland's beautiful, folkloric,typically Amercan score plays in the background, we see shots of rabbits and squirrels scurrying about. (The music soars to a huge climax in the final scene---in other versions that scene is played without a note of music.) The acting is perhaps deliberately somewhat artificial, but in a few cases gets downright hammy. B-Western star Bob Steele plays Curley with a hilarious, permanent sneer and a skulking walk; he also delivers his lines like a typical villain in a melodrama. Instead of playing Curley's wife as the pathetic yet lonely and almost unconsciously sexy woman that Sherilynn Fenn made her in the 1992 film, Betty Field makes her obnoxiously slutty, whiny, loud and shrill, and we are annoyed and repelled at her instead of being made to empathize with her plight. Charles Bickford is excellent in his role. Burgess Meredith is quite good as George, at least for the most part, but either he or director Lewis Milestone miscalculated horribly in the scene in which he makes his ultimate tragic decision---his popeyed expression as he comes to this decision is unintentionally sidesplitting. This does contain Lon Chaney, Jr's. best performance (as Lennie), but he falls short of John Malkovich's 1992 portrayal. Horrifying as it may sound today, Chaney's 1939 Lennie has been the subject of countless cartoon parodies--it's the inspiration for all those cartoons that feature a huge bear saying I done a clever thing, George, duh, I done a clever thing, as well as Bugs Bunny's abominable snowman saying I will hug him and pet him and squeeze him and hug him and pet him and squeeze him, and , well.....you get the idea.

There are more emotions being shuffled up in its script as there are minutes in the movie. The story is also very hard to follow. So how can a movie like this work?The comedy part of this film details a hotel waiter in Italy in the 1930s, Guido, played by Benign, who also directed and co-wrote the movie.  This man is a clown in some ways, and he creates most of the film's funny slapstick humor. A few examples of this include Guido arriving in town in a runaway car with failed brakes, his love at first sight with a woman named Dora, the many different directions one hat can lead to, and how he is mistaken for a school inspector giving a speech about his wonderful body.After he and Dora eventually get married and have a son, who is five years old the first time we meet him, we learn that he is Jewish. In 1945, all of the Jews in the town are sent to a prison camp by the Fascists. Doha makes the decision come along to be with her family.However, Guido makes up a story about a game that all of this is to his son to prevent him from learning the horror of the truth. The game is where everyone competes to be the fastest to earn 1000 points, then the prize is a real life tank.It's at this point where the film takes off, and makes the audience feel sorry for the characters. And the story is as breathtaking as it is realistic. The film softens the holocaust to put in this humor, however. In real life I'm not sure that the couple would have lasted a week.The performances were overlooked by me until the film's third act, where the father learns to keep his cool under all of this stress.
