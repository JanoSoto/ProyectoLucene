He is asked to do a series on anti-Semitism. But not as it has been done before, but with a special angle. He is going to pretend to be Jewish, so that he can not only talk about, but also feel it, live it. And gets the full experience. Job applications turned down, hotel reservations suddenly invalid, and so on. And it infuriates him. At the same time he meets Kathy, the chief editor's niece. From the first moment they fall in love, but their relationship is not without hard edges. In fact, Kathy might be his biggest obstacle of all.Comments Very well done, and as such, deviously frightening. In many ways much more frightening and sickening than other later movies, like American History X, that has dealt with the subject. They are frightening because they show the extremist elements in our society. A Gentleman's Agreement is much more frightening because it shows the ordinary in our society. You and me. Where anti-Semitism (or really any anti-feeling you can think of. It is easy to change with anti-equality (feminism), anti-Islam, anti-&#x85;) can find hold and grow unnoticed, and show it hideous fangs without no one really seeing it. There is a saying For evil to prevail, all that is required is that good men do nothing. A Gentleman's Agreement try to show this.One of its main strengths is that it made me think. Made me feel and made me search myself. It is very easy to identify yourself with the good people in this movie. And it made me wonder who I was. Was I a Kathy or a Phil? Or rather, when has I chosen to be who, and why? Am I more of the deeply good people, but that seems to do nothing, or am I Phil, that tries to speak up whenever I sense evil? I hope I am the latter, but I'm not entirely sure, and that is what is so frightening. What I am sure of, is that it is important that we constantly searches ourselves, questions ourselves so that we can be Phil. A Gentleman's Agreement did that, it made me do that. And that is why it is equally important and relevant today as the day it was released. Phil's mother says she wants to grow old and see a time when everyone lives together without hate or fear and hopes it will come about in the next century. That is now, and we still has a long, long way to go.Well, the important issue aside, something more direct about the movie then. As mentioned above it is very easy to identify with the different characters. And that wouldn't have been possible if not for two things. First they would have been defined and crafted well in the script, and then acted out flawlessly by the actors. They are and the do. It is really an achievement by Peck and Dorothy McGuire strongly supported by their colleagues. And certainly Kazan's direction is well enough. It is only one thing I wish would have been done differently. Phil and Kathy keep having arguments, and what is somewhat tiresome is that it is the same argument over and over again. It gets a little old. On the other hand it is one of the main points of the movie, leading right up to the ending so I wouldn't cut them out for the world. But somehow you might focus a little different upon them or at least dress it up with different words. I'm not sure, it is a very delicate matter.Can't say I enjoyed the movie. Enjoy is the wrong word. And interesting is too weak a word to describe it. I sat glued to the screen for the entire run, that's for sure. It's frightening and captivating at the same time.

He had been collaborating with Nazi agents working in the U.S.. What she doesn't know is that he is about to commit suicide. She doesn't share his convictions anyway. That's why she is approached by Devlin, an American agent. Alicia's father's companions seem to be working out of Brazil. But their network is tight and Devlin and friends has had little luck breaking it. But maybe Alicia can gain their trust, considering her father. Alicia agrees reluctantly. What she didn't expect though, and neither did Devlin is that they would fall for each other. Now their feelings might endanger their mission and put them at great risk.Comments A classic Hitchcock, with good reviews. But in my mind not close to being one of his better movies. I seem not to catch on. The movie, to me at least, seems never to get into gear. The story stumbles, seems to repeat itself, not really able to move on. And the catch up is the love story. It doesn't seem believable. Especially Grant, or Devlin, is hard to believe to be in love. Sure, he is a trained agent, he must be in total control of his emotions. But he never for a moment lets on. He says the word but doesn't seem to believe them himself. He carries the same facial expression all the time, when he meets Alicia or his boss. So why should I believe they're in love when they don't seem to believe it themselves.The spy story works, but it is a little too easy. The Nazi agents are never ant real threats to Alicia or Devlin, not even at the end, the supposed climax of the movie, do they pose any real threat. The threat instead is Alicia's and Devlin's love for each other, but when that part falters, also the threat vanishes. The entire movie depends on the love to be true, to be the threat to their lives but something they can't deny or walk away from. But when it isn't, the entire story falls in on itself. The spy story isn't complex or thrilling enough to entirely save the movie.Still watchable, though.
