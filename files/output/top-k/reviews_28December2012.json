It has an ending that is not predictable, but that is not surprising and is loose enough.It is a story of magical realism that becomes a strange variant of vampire movies told in a somewhat cold and graphic fashion, which can sometimes be grotesque, but all the mystery that surrounds it is what makes that the spectator can't stop seeing it, although it does not have enough characters empathetic and some are very gray.  The script is pretty weak (lacking strength), draws attention because of what we want to see, but how has it ends up leaving you wanting more.

Two apolitical people go about their lives while impending doom surrounds them. Cabaret is a ground-breaking combination of social drama and musical entertainment. It's one of the best examples of films from the New Hollywood. This was a short time in American cinema where the studios were producing challenging and director-led personal films.What Cabaret does which is so unique is to reinvent what the musical could be. It's a film that is essentially a drama that uses musical numbers to comment on its story. The songs all fit into a realistic narrative. Most of them are sung within the confines of the Kit Kat Klub, the cabaret of the title. In taking this approach the movie is more able to incorporate a disturbing subject such as the Germany's progression to Nazism into this most fantastical and joyous of film genres. All of the songs comment on the social situation in Germany at the time and because they are all performed in the cabaret they can be explained in a real context, cleverly allowing those who do not even like musicals to enjoy them as they do not break the illusion of reality. The one song that is performed outside the club is perhaps the most memorable however. 'Tomorrow Belongs to Me' is sung by a young fresh-faced boy with an angelic voice. It starts out quite beautifully but as it progresses the camera pans down and we see the emblem of the swastika on a band around his arm and realise he is a Hitler Youth. The words suddenly take on an altogether more sinister meaning. It's a moment that really encapsulates the way that fascism seemed like a progressive way ahead for the majority of people at the time. With the benefit of hindsight we, of course, see the horror of what it represents but for many Germans at the time, the ideals of Hitlerism had an attraction, and 'Tomorrow Belongs to Me' brilliantly illustrates both these points.Another way in which the film differentiates itself from most others that deal with this time and place is that there is barely a mention of the Nazis at all. All the Nazis characters exist in the periphery of the story, they barely interact with the characters in any way. Their significance is in no need of emphasis; their presence is ominously felt throughout. Cabaret reflects the changes in Germany from the point of view of people living in their own little world but the true horror is never far from the surface. The strange insular world of the Kit Kat Klub encapsulates this perfectly. Hosted by the enigmatic, almost supernatural, Master of Ceremonies, it's a decadent place that exists apart from the realities of Hitlerism, a place that we all know must be ultimately doomed when the Nazis fully rise to power.Performances are universally great with Michael York and Liza Minnelli both putting in very fine work. Minnelli especially has to be credited for combining both dramatic acting and musical performances of both the highest calibre. The songs themselves are memorable and work in the clever double way of providing entertainment while commenting on dark issues below the surface. In a sense, that is the genius of Cabaret overall.

Loved Alien; Loved Blade Runner. Then I hated everything up to American Gangster, which I thought was alright but not fantastic. Robin Hood was the next one I hated. Then came Prometheus, which I didn't hate, but after three viewings I'm still wondering if it was just a really expensive commercial for Christianity. Still, at least Russell Crowe wasn't in it.Russell Crowe! Does he know something about all the big Hollywood directors that they don't want made public? Did he find their sex dungeon? Seriously, how is he getting all these roles? It certainly isn't on ability. I think he might actually be a worse actor than Sean Connery.That's the main problem with Gladiator, and with many of Ridley Scott's films. Russell Crowe is in them, and I think it's a sign of Scott's increasingly poor judgement. Yes, I grant you, Russell Crowe may have appeared to be good in Romper Stomper, but we now know that he actually is a mentally challenged thug with delusions of grandeur so it doesn't count.Anyway, there are other issues, like the mind numbing tedium of watching an unimaginative director play with his enormous budget for hours, or the excruciatingly familiar plot lurking beneath the costumes, or the pantomime bad guy hammed into the middle of next week by Joaquin Phoenix.That brings me back to the acting, and the Crowe. Crowe time! That's what my inside voice shouts when he appears; it helps me get through films that he's in. The worst instance of Crowe time! in Gladiator is the bizarrely comical moment where he finds his character's family dead and tries to act accordingly; it's like an acting version of karaoke. I started to think that the original role was played by Harvey Keitel and he was probably this Australian bloke's favourite actor.Story wise, it's like a badly remembered history lesson retold in the style of Dallas, or Prisoner Cell Block H, at least that's the way the Dramatic scenes come across; the action is much more in the direction of a period Arnold Schwarzenegger film where the bad guys appear to have run straight out of a computer game just in time to be slain due to their low skill level and intelligence. Don't get me wrong, I like Arnie; you know where you stand with Arnie. Ditto computer games. The problem here is that it seems really out of context.Some people have complained about the historical accuracy; I don't care about that. I'm not overly interested in the Roman Empire and as a result the level of historical detail\/accuracy would be lost on me anyway.

Ridley Scott is not a great director. David Lynch is a great director. David Cronenberg is a great director. David Lean is a great director. Why are they all called David? I don't know. In Britain high profile political journalists are called John.

Dialog is particularly lacking, in some scenes even leaving Tom Skerritt with nothing to do but mutter incoherently, or a game Shatner mugging as if he's about to say something but either gets cut off or thinks better of it. The two actors do their best, Skerritt all steely-eyed intensity and Shatner oozing lily-livered Southern charm, as do Royal Dano as a flustered preacher and a shockingly young-looking Noble Willingham as a lecherous bootlegging uncle. As for the actresses, they certainly deliver the goods, and frequently, especially Angie Dickinson. Yowzah. If you're worried, Angie gets progressively more naked as the plot moves along. Look close for a young and quickly unadorned Sally Kirkland.Plotwise? Angie, rural 1932-vintage single mom, saddled with two unmanageable daughters (one way too naive and one way too not so), after extricating one daughter from a hasty wedding, dips her toe into crime (bootlegging and DAV-smoker-jacking), then gets mired in it after hooking up with bank robber Skerritt. An encounter with down-and-out Southern gent Shatner seals their fate, as he proves to be their little gang's weakest link. Along the way, much blood, clothing and inhibitions will be shed.Considering the budget and shooting time, the action is boisterous enough but haphazard and disjointed, with a lot of repetitive car chases featuring Dick Miller and a sidekick (representing the entirety of the FBI) in hot pursuit, miraculously always one step behind our anti-heroine and her mob. One shudders to see how many vintage autos run up dirt ramps and flip over. Even if you know that the Hollywood hills don't actually look a lot like East Texas (the geography of where our characters are supposed to be at any moment in the plot isn't always made abundantly clear), the small-town locations and antique cars do an impressive job of keeping the movie in its Depression-era period.Look quickly for second-unit director Paul Bartel as a party guest, following in the footsteps of Francis Coppola in The Young Racers.

The original novel(Jude the Obscure) is translated in a brilliant script by Hossein Amini and centers on the aspirations of a lower-class man,Jude Fawley(Christopher Ecclestone),who fights to become a university man. After a quick and wrong marriage with an humble country girl,Arabella(Rachel Griffiths), he met his cousin Sue Bridehead(Kate Winslet)an intelligent,beautiful and apparently as unconventional and brave as him. Their passionate love will end tragically though. The film is from the end to the beginning sad and depressing at his best since we see Jude and Sue fight against the Victorian society's beliefs such as a legalized marriage(they only live as a couple)and the impossible aspirations of a lower-class man who would like to become equal to his peers and study at the university. Ultimately their lives will be destroyed by a cruel destiny. Jude is completely coherent to his ideas but Sue is a tormented and fragile woman who,in the end, is not able to came to terms with what she professed at the beginning. In the end, she turns to religion and accepts a life she rejected because she feels guilty. Christoph Ecclestone and Kate Winslet are just superb. Ecclestone is a serious underrated actor who should be in the spotlight. He never misses a beat and gives an amazing performance. Kate Winslet is completely committed to her role and gives a dramatic performance that is devastating. The director gives the a vivid and crude cut and confirms his uncommon abilities to tell a story set in a different era as we're seeing a modern tragedy.His direction is as tormented as his leads and we can't help but have a feeling that he is not afraid to show the crudest side and the terrible contradictions of the Victorian period. my vote is 10\/10.
