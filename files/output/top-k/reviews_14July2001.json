How have they done this?' The animation is just that animation. It's not photo-realistic, but gives the impression of reality in its use of depth, texture, and movement of people and objects. After about an hour you begin to take it for granted. You think less and less about how this feat was accomplished and more about the actual plot. FF never sells you on it, though. Perhaps the animation is too good. By this I mean that the so-so story is so uncompelling it actually keeps drawing your attention back to the animation. The audience wants to feel like it's sitting there for a reason. FF never comes up with a better reason than the amazing CG artistry to keep watching, and that's a shame.The main character, Dr. Aki Ross, is actually quite fascinating. You really think of her as a real person, like she's got a soul, that she came from somewhere. The other characters are not as well thought-out, either in appearance or personality. Take Aki's leading man, Grey, for instance. His animators make no attempt NOT to make him look like Ben Affleck. Then they give him Alec Baldwin's scratchy, too-old sounding voice (it's Rafe McCawley voiced by Colonel Doolittle!). It's just a bit unnerving. Added is a cast of throw-away macho soldier-types voiced by the likes of Peri Gilpin (Roz!), Steve Buscemi and Marcellus Wallace, er, Ving Rhames who are supposed to add humor and emotional depth to the story. What they contribute is no better or worse than, say, the Nebuchadnezzar crew in Matrix. Final Fantasy proves that even computer-animated people can be bad actors. Real actors can stop worrying that they'll be replaced by a software program.Still, Final Fantasy is the best of the genre since The Matrix. There are so many great ideas in it, ideas that would have been difficult to execute with live-action. What makes good Sci-Fi is the story, though. FF seems to be a collection of homages to other Sci-Fi staples like the Alien films. That it's set in the future and the Earth has been destroyed by a meteor is straight out of the Sci-Fi movie textbook. The alien 'ghosts' are the difference here. They exist in some spirit dimension (or something) so instead of squishing people, they suck their life-force or soul right out of them, which is more freaky really. And then there's the story behind the ghosts, which come in all sizes and species, another cool idea. What they really are and where they came from is a mystery that slowly unfolds over the course of the story.FF will be remembered for being the first major motion picture to use all animated human characters. I was almost more impressed with the many scenes involving people doing nothing more than standing in a room talking. At times I thought, if there's going to be this much of this stuff, wouldn't live-action have been easier? But then you think about how sci-fi action, aliens, spaceships, other-worldly landscapes have all been done in CG animation before, but scenes with people standing around in a room talking have not. Director Hironobu Sakaguchi and company are really showing off more with the talking head scenes than the big action sequences. After all, the last thing this guy directed was a video game. He's an old hand at that, but not at stuff like the emotional exploration of characters.Ultimately, Final Fantasy was conceived as Sci-Fi action and so, mission accomplished.

I liked that they took the subject matter more seriously and that they took a darker route, but there's too many flaws in this sequel to ignore. A shame too...STORY A rather weak script with some kool ideas. The final confrontation in the Myers house, everything that Loomis did, Michael's new mean streak, and the awesome telepathic link with Jamie certainly scored this movie points. Well, the link was handled rather clumsily because never really explained but whatever. I loved how they made it seem that Michael may have a soul after all and his scenes with Jamie were both tense and strangely touching.It's nice to see Michael develop as a character. I also liked how Michael was treated more like a real serial killer. It added a much needed touch of realism. What I didn't love was the whole Man in Black thing. It slowed down the story and led to an ending that p***** me off. This could be forgiven since H5 was meant as a set up sequel rather than it's own movie. That's the key flaw here. If they had focused on just making Halloween 5, rather than setting up for Part VI, then the movie would have been much better. Also, the comedy just didn't belong here. It detracted from the film's grim atmosphere.ACTING Mostly decent. Donald Pleasance gives a spirited performance as Sam Loomis, this time more obsessed with stopping Michael than ever. He was willing to risk Jamie's life in order to stop Michael once and for all and that shows a lot about the good doctor. The scenes where Loomis tried to reach Michael were the most interesting of the film. Pleaseance really made you believe that Michael had a shot at redemption. Don Shanks has a terrible mask to work with, but conveys Michael's sick nature and his rage perfectly. He was also the perfect choice to be Michael during his unmasking scenes.

The scenes where Loomis tried to reach Michael were the most interesting of the film. Pleaseance really made you believe that Michael had a shot at redemption.

When I left the theater at the end of this film I asked myself would I liked to be cloned and have my memories after I die, or would I like to be cloned and live on.  The answer I came up with was no.  The clone wouldn´t be me, it may have my memories, but I would be dead.  This question was answered when I saw this film for the first time.  The plot is something like this, the film opens in the early 21st century with a quarterback for the XFL (note this film came out before the league dissipated).  Anyways the quarterback is seriously injured, and will possibly remain a vegetable.  They decide to pull the plug on his life support system, and he dies, only to be cloned.  Later we have Adam Gibson played by Arnold Schwarzenegger.  He is about to celebrate his birthday, and he has a wife and daughter.  Later he and his pilot partner are going to fly Billionaire Michael Drucker (Tony Goldwyn) up some mountains in state of the art choppers, which turn into jets, its really cool.  They take off and later Adam awakens in a car on his way to a re-pet store.  The store clones your animal after it dies, which Adam is against.  He later decides not to go in and picks up a sim pal which is a futuristic version of doll.  He goes home, and finds a duplicate of himself in his house with his family.  After he sees them two agents come up to him, and tells him that he has been cloned.  He try´s to go into his house and they stop him.  A chase ensues, and I won´t bore you with the rest of the plot.I want to talk about the the characters that get continuously cloned.   They are agents that work for Drucker.  Talia (Sarah Wynter), Marshall (Michael Rooker), and Wiley (Rodney Rowland).  It was hilarious seeing these people die over and over again and keep getting cloned.  Talia gets shot, and her fingers blasted off, but she is still cloned.  Marshall gets his feet blown off, and Wiley gets his neck broken, and he is run over by a car.  It was funny, when he states that he could feel the pain of those two incidents, and the others telling him that it wasn´t his real organs that got broken.Robert Duvall gives an excellent performance as the Dr. Weir the man behind the cloning.  I love the scene just before his wife died who was a clone, and she telling him not to clone her again.  He realizes the error of his ways and questions his work when he finds out that Drucker had put defects in all of the clones.Tony Goldwyn gives an excellent performance as Michael Drucker the sinister man who whom Weir works for.  This man has a god complex.  He stated that he was taking over where god left off.  This man has no morals or redeeming qualities, he orders the deaths of people, without even considering his actions.  Goldwyn plays an excellent villain.This story tells of the dangers of cloning, and makes the viewer ask themselves if they would like to be cloned.  I think that Roger Spotiswoode directed a great story, and Schwarzenegger was excellent I loved seeing him act opposite himself (his Clone). I believe that if a Sci-fi film makes you think, then its worthy of checking out.  If you haven´t seen this movie I highly recommend it.

The problem here is that this movie doesn't measure up to the high standards set by the first two and absolutely fails at being the least bit scary.STORY I personally liked the script here and I feel it had the potential to be the best of the series if it were put into more capable hands. What pi***es me off is the lack of continuation here. Didn't Michael get his eyes shot out? He has 20\/20 here. Didn't Michael and Loomis get roasted in that fire? I could see how they may have gotten out alive, but it's a bit of a stretch. This movie had many fun sequences such as Mikey climbing up on the roof and the awesome pick up truck finale. Another problem I have is some of the dialouge. I felt like I was watching the wonder years during the family sequences and the whole love triangle reeked of teen-age soap opera and was simply boring. It's nice to see that they kept the plot simple though because the complex s*** was what bogged down the next few entries. The lynch mob was my favorite aspect of the movie. The twist at the end was a classic.ACTING Donald Pleasance gives a great performance as our hero, Dr. Loomis. Everything he says or does is believeable. Danielle Harris is damn good in her first movie and as cute as hell. I felt sorry for her when she was being teased and she did a great job of being scared shitless when Uncle Mike came after her. Ellie Cornell does well with her role, but she isn't any Jamie Lee Curtis. The new sheriff is a great character and needed more screentime. Even the drunk hicks were convincing in their attempt to lynch Myers. The rest of the teen actors were pathetic stereotypes, but one gives us a nice ass shot and the other was in Buffy the Vampire Slayer so I guess they'd be bearable.DIRECTING Little does a rather sh***y job here. He does create some kool dark and grim surroundings, but the scares are simply crappy. Just a simple and fast close up of Michael doing nothing. Rather lame. This movie also has absolutely no suspense. No stalk scenes. Michael simply walks onscreen and kills someone and then walks off. All attempts to be scary fall flat. I can't help thinking that this movie may have been scary and more atmospheric if it had been in better hands. Little is a fine action director but he knows little about making a horror film. Thankfully his expertise in action helped save the movie from being a total loss.MUSIC It had a pretty cool version of the Halloween theme, but the rest of the score wasn't really up to par. It's okay but my least favorite of the series. We also have a few bad 80s pop songs here and there, but they're hardly noticeable.OTHER One of the worst things about this movie was Michael's mask. It was incredibly cheesy and made Michael look silly. The murders in this movie also kinda sucked. Michael doesn't go around crushing skulls and it just didn't look right. I like innovative murders, but most of the ones in this movie were simply ridiculous. Their over-the-top style clashed with the dark tone the movie was TRYING to make and that's part of the reason why it failed to be scary. The T&A in this movie is rather scant and it's a shame considering the girl who hid her top...oh well...no big deal.Overall this is a rather weak sequel to the 1978 classic and you shouldn't bother with it unless you liked the first two enough to want more. It's not a total loss and it's a good movie to watch with your buds. I'm probably being too nice but I'm giving it **.At least Loomis was great...

He does create some kool dark and grim surroundings, but the scares are simply crappy. Just a simple and fast close up of Michael doing nothing. Rather lame. This movie also has absolutely no suspense. No stalk scenes. Michael simply walks onscreen and kills someone and then walks off. All attempts to be scary fall flat. I can't help thinking that this movie may have been scary and more atmospheric if it had been in better hands. Little is a fine action director but he knows little about making a horror film. Thankfully his expertise in action helped save the movie from being a total loss.MUSIC It had a pretty cool version of the Halloween theme, but the rest of the score wasn't really up to par. It's okay but my least favorite of the series. We also have a few bad 80s pop songs here and there, but they're hardly noticeable.OTHER One of the worst things about this movie was Michael's mask. It was incredibly cheesy and made Michael look silly. The murders in this movie also kinda sucked. Michael doesn't go around crushing skulls and it just didn't look right. I like innovative murders, but most of the ones in this movie were simply ridiculous. Their over-the-top style clashed with the dark tone the movie was TRYING to make and that's part of the reason why it failed to be scary. The T&A in this movie is rather scant and it's a shame considering the girl who hid her top...oh well...no big deal.Overall this is a rather weak sequel to the 1978 classic and you shouldn't bother with it unless you liked the first two enough to want more. It's not a total loss and it's a good movie to watch with your buds. I'm probably being too nice but I'm giving it **.At least Loomis was great...

What an awful movie.  I couldn't wait for it to end.  I was eager to watch it because of the great cast (Edward Norton, Drew Barrymore) but it was just as terrible as all his other ones, in fact, worse.  Dancing and singing ghosts in a funeral home?  I'll stick with the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland, thanks.And why does Woody Allen always put himself in every movie sleeping with the most beautiful star he can (in this case Julia Roberts?)  Not very believable. ","genre":"Comedy, Musical, Romance"},{"date":"14 July 2001","score":"","review":"  Saw the Mummy Returns at our movie buffet. (Four dollars gets you a movie just coming out of the first run theaters and all the soda and popcorn you care to eat. Not a bad deal.) I didn't think that it was absolutely the worst movie of all time, but it was pretty awful. First, the pros They assembled the original cast (actually everyone was griping about how tenuous the link was between this and the original, but I didn't think it was that bad. Certainly it wasn't the biggest problem the movie had) and the bimbo appeal was great. The cons It takes itself way too seriously, and the gags aren't NEARLY as funny as they think they are. I interpreted the first movie as rather tongue in cheek, kind of poking fun at itself along the way, but not so with this. I kept wondering if there was some kind of oblique biblical reference going on, what with there being 12 tribes of desert warrior people, as compared to the 12 tribes of the Israelites. The badguys were the only characters that were even mildly interesting. I don't know quite what was going on with the pygmy mummies, as I had broken my glasses and I really can't see without them...but I bet it was stupid. Everything was overstylized. Why draw your sword like a normal person when you can whip it out of the sheath with some elaborate motions and some Power Rangers sound effects? Ugh.

As Edward Norton said, these guys could've been reading the phone book and I would've shown up to watch.  Was it a good movie?  Yes, in comparison to some of the other crap out there this summer.  Was the script up to the standards of these three actors?  No way.  This is a very standard heist movie.Caution, some spoilers ahead.The opening scene is extremely anti-climatic.  In fact, it's dull.  You get a feel for the precision in which DeNiro's character works, but it didn't raise my blood pressure at all, nor really draw me into the movie.The middle of the movie dragged in some parts.  It was all set up for the final heist, but certain scenes got downright boring.  DeNiro's character is the only one that really has any depth.  While Norton's character has a lot of good lines, I never really got a good feel for what his story was and how he knew Brando's character and got into all this in the first place.  And we really find out nothing about Brando's character.  He seems to be there to deliver funny lines.The final heist is, however, very exciting and very original.  I was on the edge of my seat.  And the ending is really good.  You'll leave the theatre laughing at the cockiness of youth.NitpicksAngela Bassett's character was completely unnecessary, and her role was TINY.  I heard many of her scenes were cut, so hopefully we'll get to see those when the DVD comes out.All three actors give fine performances, but I had a hard time buying Norton's handicapped act.  Even though I think he's a great actor, it felt very fake to me.During the final heist, Norton's character had to know that Danny the janitor would eventually come looking for him because he was gone so long. You'd think that he would have covered himself a little better on that end. Was this because he was inexperienced?  Possibly, but it felt like a huge and obvious slip up.  And why on Earth did he let him live?  Duh.  Even I've seen enough heist movies to know what he should have done.  And why didn't they loop the tape in the security cameras instead of shutting them off? They had to know that the security guards would come looking for them eventually if the cameras were off for that long.End of spoilers!I do recommend this movie, purely for the cast members.  Don't expect a whole new idea, here.  Like I said, it's a standard heist movie.  There are some memorable scenes and good dialogue, and compared to a lot of the crap that's come out lately, this one's a keeper.  I look forward to seeing the extras when the DVD comes out.
