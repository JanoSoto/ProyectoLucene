Not only one of the best musical life style orientated films, but one of the best films ever made. I still don't understand why this film has had a UK release.A very strong cast who portray there characters beautifully. Absolutely perfect acting, you get taken in to the movie and believe you are there with them. When watching the film you realise even though the cast is very small, every character is vital even if they are only in the film for 10 minutes.What people need to realise is that this film is for everyone and not just punks, the film is aimed at everyone and i think everyone has a bit of Steveo in them.This a film about growing up, adolescence, drugs, love, partying and music. There are two key characters Steveo and his flatmate Herorin Bob (name explained in the film). I don't want to give any spoilers, but the reason why this film is so strong is because you can only pigeon hole it as a film about life. It has everything in it, it is not meant to be comedy, drama,thriller what ever. It is just about honest friendship and life.
