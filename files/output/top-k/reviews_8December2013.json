So now because I have heard so much about how great the latest instalment was I have been going back and watching them all. The first film certainly has a strong appeal to it. Car movies are not necessarily my thing, I don't know a lick about cars except how to drive (and my wife would say even that is questionable.) Still the original film in this series also is one of the only ones I have seen outside of Tokyo Drift that is still truly about fast cars and racing. The series eventually evolves into more of a heist\/criminal underworld sort of spin but this is truly about the cars. Right off the bat you're dropped into the action and there is some truly excellent action scenes. The characters are not brilliant but they are well defined and interesting despite being very predictable and stereotypical. One thing the Fast Furious series forces down your throats is the idea that this group is a family and will do anything for each other. They start this concept in this movie and then repeat it over and over and over again. A smarter series would let you feel that devotion and friendship with character development. But it is what it is, a simple action flick that entertains.This cast has made their bread and butter with this series. Vin Diesel is a star from this series and a few other roles but mostly this. He fits into it like a round peg into a round hole. He is a good anti-hero and his rough tough as nails charisma works in the movie. Paul Walker also made his name in this series. He is the yin to Diesel's yang. He is softer spoken, the red blooded all American type who is undercover within this gang and becomes one of the family. Walker is a little stiff in his performance and he certainly isn't flexing any major acting muscles but he is a necessity to the story and his chemistry with Diesel works very well. Jordana Brewster is Diesel's sister and Walker's love interest and she does decently. Her character gets very little development but she has a purpose and serves it well. Her chemistry with Walker is solid and their romance is definitely worthwhile. Michelle Rodriguez is Diesel's love interest and I think they actually have great chemistry, very hot on screen but she is very underused in this movie. I was surprised she got such a name from being in this because she is definitely a supporting character and way in the background most of the time. Rick Yune is decent but completely underused and under developed as the villain o sorts. He could have been much better but the character is too weak. Chad Linberg does a terrific job in a very small role and gives one of the stronger performances especially in a supporting role.The film relies entirely on its stunts, fast cars and action scenes. The cast and performances are adequate at best but thanks to a constant stream of adrenaline it ends up being very entertaining. Rob Cohen has a history as a director of relying on adrenaline to make his films. He might be one of the most shallow directors in the way that his movies have very, very little depth. These films, especially this one, is the definition of mindless entertainment. You have to turn off your brain and sit back and enjoy the spectacle. I'm not in any way saying there is anything wrong with that because I was thoroughly entertained. I don't quite understand the massive following this series has but this time I was pleased with the film so what can I say. Be ready to be entertained but not overly impressed. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"8 December 2013","score":"5 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" The first Fast and Furious movie I stumbled into by accident was Tokyo Drift and much to my surprise I loved it.

One of those critically acclaimed films is Akira, which is probably one of the best films of 1988. The movie tells the story that is set in the year 2019, where Tokyo is built into a different kind of city called Neo-Tokyo. 31 years ago, an mysterious blast devastated Tokyo and now, the city is now being replaced by cutting-edge technology and warring political backgrounds. The characters in this movie are very interesting mainly because all of them, except for one, are teenagers. The teenagers are part of a biker gang and they roam the streets of Neo-Tokyo, looking for trouble. In the opening scene of Akira, we see them fighting with another biker gang called The Clowns. When one of the members of the biker gang is injured, he is sent to a hospital, where an government team is conducting an experiment on the injured boy. While the boy is being treated for his injury, the team gets a hold of a telekinesis power that is being put into the injured boy. But, there's more to that. That special power that the boy possess was the cause for the mysterious blast that occur in Tokyo 31 years ago. Even more specific, a young boy who was present in 1988 had that special power to ultimately destroy everything in sight, including the city. The young punk soon knows that he has the power to destroy anything that he sees and can only do it in his mind. He even uses it against the army that occupies the city by blowing up tanks and destroying an entire bridge. But, there's only one problem. If he overuses that power that has caused the blast in 1988, he will not have the ability to control it. That advice keeps popping up by the young kid who started the blast in 1988. Instead, the power will overcomes and destroy mankind as we know it. The punk doesn't realizes that because he thinks that having this special gift is fun. The real truth is that his ability to damage certain buildings and people can destroy his friends as well. While the boy uses the special power, an very aggressive Colonel gets involved with the young boy and he is also affected by this mysterious force. He also want to catch this kid before he even hurt or endanger the lives of others. Along the way, an government scientist teams up with the Colonel to find out the meaning behind this powerful, yet mysterious force. Akira has a lot of energy going for it. To me, the movie is a cross between Disney and the 1982 science-fiction thriller, Blade Runner, (it's ironic that both this movie and Blade Runner are set in the year 2019). The animation is very crisp and very colorful to look at. I also love the idea of having hell-raising teenagers as the protagonists, especially the young punk, who gets a hold of the supernatural power. The story of Akira is very well-told as we see this very imaginative metropolis crumbled as two-warring political parties and members clash against each other to win their independence and their freedom to express each other's thoughts and ideas. The story is also adapted from the manga of the same name. Add that and also the kid and you have a great anime movie. One of the things Akira does that other movies don't do is cast teenagers as the main characters. So many science-fiction films and anime involves adults and also older people. This movie doesn't fall into that category. I think that making teenagers interesting characters makes the movie work because as we see Neo-Tokyo develop, the entire population is swarming with warring political parties, government officials who are operating under direct orders from the military to keep everything in check and also the rebellious teenagers themselves. The main characters are almost like the kind of teenagers that bring out a lot of appeal to the audience. The action sequences is this movie are very gut-wrenching. We see in the beginning of the movie of the biker gang terrorizing the streets of Neo-Tokyo by assaulting each other while driving their motorcycles through the busy streets and highways, not even caring who gets in their way. The finale takes place in the Olympic Stadium, where the punk can't control much of what was given to him and he starts to develop into a giant moving mass, almost like a mutation of some sort. Even though he can't control the power, he doesn't even regret anything that he did wrong. We, as the audience feel his pain throughout the movie because this possession and obsession of using his power hurts him outside and inside. It even hurts and affect the people around him. The movie also tells us about how runaway technology affects everyday life like these kids that live in Neo-Tokyo. Akira is visually-stunning, packed with high-octane action throughout, and it is very violent. This movie is not recommended to younger audiences. All in all, Akira is one of the best films of 1988. It's style and action culminates itself into a anime classic. It's ground-breaking for its time and will not disappointed fans who love the genre. ★★★★ 4 stars.

Its the kind of creepy that will give you weird nightmares. I love this movie and usually watch it every time it is on. There are some intense scenes that might not be suitable for the younger audience, I watched this for the very first time when I was ten and it made me have really odd dreams for a month.

Has there been any other time travel film that has created such an impact as this film? Not that I have seen, but it is arguable as I have not seen many time traveling films.Back To The Future is written by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale. I am just get this out of the way and say that both are not the greatest of writers but they did have created an a concept that is so ambitious and at the same time so accessible that it is hard to not appreciate their writing contributions. Back To The Future's premise is the reason we watch this film and it's the reason that we keep getting hooked to it. Back To The Future's plot is ambitious, at times too ambitious that certain plot holes may be present in relation to the impact of Marty's influence, and the film also has an abundance of humor scattered throughout the film. The humor is one of the main reason that the film is so accessible and beloved, the jokes can be related to both the younger generation and the previous generation even if either generation is from the 50-80s era. The story of just having Marty's mother be infatuated with him, and lightly touches on Freud's Oedipal Complex, is hilarious and ridiculous that it still has it's effect with every viewing. Back To The Future also manages to create the most unique of friendships, a high school student and a slightly off scientist, because these characters are so well written that I didn't really mind the unbelievability of their friendship. Both writers have created a protagonist that is very close to a real teenager during the 80's and made him so appealing that every adolescent males want to be him and all teenage girls want him.Robert Zemeckis now is regarded as one of the greatest contemporary directors and Back To The Future is one of the reasons why that is so. Zemeckis was able to execute a film that has such an ambitious plot while maintaining a campy coming of age tone that can appeal to a multi-generational audience. Back To The Future and Romancing The Stone definitely made Zemeckis an important director and those become a stepping stone for him to create films with more artistic license. Back To The Future was able to create this sense of nostalgia and walk a tightrope between two generations of adolescence. Zemeckis was able to project that ability to recreate a time of adolescent youth that is relatable and fueled by references that defined that time period; Zemeckis has definitely created something that was similar to what George Lucas did for American Graffiti.Dean Cundey started off as a cinematographer of the most popular Horror films of all time, including Halloween and The Thing. After working with Zemeckis on Romancing With The Stone, he did a complete turn around working in much more light-hearted and optimistic films. Cundey did a decent job here and was able to juxtapose two different looks for the film, the dark and dirty look for the 80s and the warm and colorful look of the 50's. Cundey's photography isn't as in your face with nostalgia, like The Godfather, as it consistently takes a more contemporary style throughout the film. Cundey shoots this film to serve the plot and maintaining that accessibility and light hearted tone that Zemeckis wanted instead of drawing attention to itself. The cinematography for this film may not be as loved as the film's writing or musical score but Cundey doesn't slouch with this film.Alan Silvestri was brought in to compose the score for Back To The Future and what a wonderful job he has done here. Silvestri's score here is one of the most memorable film scores that competes with other films like Star Wars and Indiana Jones. It has the ability to stick under your skin and will have you bobbing your head when it comes on. Huey Lewis' Power of Love is so catchy that it just stands out and had me singing the lyrics every time it comes on. The song is able to blend in with Silvestri's score which prevents me from drawing too much attention to it and feeling like it's out of place.Michael J. Fox is the star of this film, embodying this character who is a product of a rebellious and erratic generation. Fox brings personality to McFly by acting like how cool teenage adolescents were like in his time period. When he is sent back in time, Fox was able to portray this fish out of water kind of personality and emotion that makes his entrapment believable. Christopher Lloyd plays the slightly intense scientist who has created time traveling. Lloyd definitely has given such a memorable performance and nobody else was able to capture his performance in any other film. Lloyd was able to balance humor and the seriousness with such flourish that he was to place weight in the story of the scene. Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover play Marty's parents and both do a very good job and was able to embody both their young and older self, though at times Glover at the start of the film was quite over the top and had me cringing a couple of times. Thomas F. Wilson was good as a cliché looking bully Biff. He was able to give off this toughness quality that is able to make the McFly's feel inferior.Back To The Future by now is regarded as a classic and I can see why. This film will appeal to every generation and it's legacy will continue to grow as time passes. Back To The Future is still Zemeckis' best film and will forever remain as a timeless piece of cinema.

And when you think of the Stephen King projects that have become films...that's pretty mixed, too. A few have been very good. A few awful. And others somewhere in between. And that's where this one stands...in between.First off, you have the special effects. Considering this was made 30 years ago, they're darned good. So that gets an A.Then there's the cast...notable cast. David Keith as the dad...well, he was okay. Drew Barrymore as the firestarter...stunning, and only 9 years old when this was made! Freddie Jones as one of the scientists with a little bit of conscience was interesting...as long as he lasted. A young Heather Locklear does what she does best...looks beautiful. Martin Sheen as the head of the project was quite good. George C. Scott...well, I'm a pretty big fan of him...but I wasn't that impressed with him here...and I can't think of the last time I said that! Art Carney is fun to watch here. As is Louise Fletcher. Moses Gunn...an actor I had forgotten about; good to see him again, here as one of the scientists.In terms of the script. Well, not too bad, not great. The problem with the story is that you already know what the ending of the film is going to be -- a prepubescent Carrie-like fiery finale. So the question is, will the director make getting there interesting. Sometimes yes, sometimes no. Some good dialog, some dialog that almost made me laugh out loud.So, it's sort of a draw.

All of those elements make The Crow a Cult Classic and a powerful movie experience.Based on James O'Barr Comic Book Series and Comic Strip and set in Detroit,Michigan,The Crow tells the story of Eric Draven(Brandon Lee),a rock musician who along with his fiancée Shelly(Sofia Shinas)were assaulted and murdered by a group of thugs on Devil's Night,the night before Halloween. A year later after the murder,Eric is brought back from the grave to get revenge on the killers who murdered him and his fiancée and wants vengeance at all costs.Released in 1994,The Crow is brilliant and powerful film that came out a year after the tragic death of Brandon Lee(the son of the late,great legendary Martial Arts\/Kung-Fu Icon Bruce Lee)who died on the set after an unfortunate accident while making the film. Although Brandon Lee's death loomed over the movie,The Crow became a critical and box office success and also became a Cult Film thanks to Brandon Lee's final performance and is seen as one of the best Comic Book films ever made. The Crow is an amazing film that right from the beginning pulls into a dark,Gothic nightmare that is grim and gloomy and looks like a Graphic novel coming to life with beauty and ugliness but is also a movie that is Action-packed and visually stunning and when you see The Crow the first time it will blow your mind. The Crow is a film that deals with themes such as tragedy,death,revenge and love which gives the movie a sadness that surrounds the film's atmosphere as well as the characters which gives The Crow depth and substance. Another thing I love about The Crow is the style and look of the movie thanks to the beautiful camera work and lighting by Dariusz Wolski. Wolski's photography and lighting gives The Crow a great and unique look that is in the style of Film Noir and Dystopian with rainy streets and buildings that are in the dark with the movie almost giving the film a timeless quality that combines the look of Tim Burton's Batman and Ridley Scott's Blade Runner because with The Crow you as a viewer don't know if it's the past,present or future. The Crow is also in the style of Film Noir with the characters attitudes which are cynical and bleak with no happy ending satisfaction. The main character Eric Draven is one of the best characters in a comic book film because even though Draven is back from the dead and looking for revenge he has depth and sympathy while having good(Draven's time with Shelly)and bad memories(him and Shelly's murder)which gives Draven and the film great power because what The Crow tells viewers even when you're dead a person still has a memory. Eric Draven is a character who represents the dark and gloomy tone and when he is off the screen you can feel Draven's presence because he represents violence,death and darkness. Eric Draven is a incredible character that you will never forget and is a character that will forever be a Cult icon and a classic anti hero that is timeless and for the ages. The Action scenes in The Crow are fantastic and done with a great pace and style which is fierce and at times brutal but if you are an Action movie lover the Action will have you foaming at the mouth and will keep glued to the screen with Action scenes of intensity,great excitement and explosive thrills. The ending of The Crow is amazing, beautiful and bittersweet because with the ending you will feel happy and sad for Eric Draven. A great conclusion.The whole cast is terrific. Brandon Lee is excellent and unforgettable as Eric Draven,with Lee bringing depth,sadness and charisma to the performance. R.I.P Brandon Lee,you and your acting talent were gone too soon. Rochelle Davis is wonderful as Sarah,Eric's friend. Ernie Hudsen is terrific as Sergeant Albrecht,a cop that helps Eric. Michael Wincott is amazing as Top Dollar,a local crime boss. Anna Thomson is fantastic as Darla,Sarah's drug addicted Mother. David Patrick Kelly(T-Bird),Angel David(Skank),Laurence Mason(Tin Tin)and Michael Masse(Funboy)do great jobs as Top Dollar's henchmen. Jon Polito is outstanding and funny as Gideon,a pawn shop owner. Sofia Shinas is beautiful and memorable as Shelly,Eric's fiancé. Tony Todd(Grange),Bai Ling(Myca) and Marco Rodriguez(Torres)give good performances as well. The direction by Alex Ployas is brilliant and stylish,with Ployas always moving the camera giving the film a dark and grim visual style to the film. Amazing direction,Ployas.The score by Graeme Revell is terrific,haunting and unforgettable and adds to the tone of the film. Great score,Revell. There is also an amazing soundtrack with songs by Nine Inch Nails(Dead Souls),Stone Temple Pilots(Big Empty),The Cure(Burn),Pantera(The Badge),Rage Against The Machine(Darkness),Rollins Band(Ghostrider),Medicine(Time Baby III)and more. Fantastic soundtrack.In final word,if you love Action Films or Comic Book Movies,I highly suggest you see The Crow,an excellent,stylish Comic adaptation and classic that you can watch again and again and belongs in every movie lover's collection. Highly Recommended. 10\/10.

The ending of The Crow is amazing, beautiful and bittersweet because with the ending you will feel happy and sad for Eric Draven. A great conclusion.The whole cast is terrific. Brandon Lee is excellent and unforgettable as Eric Draven,with Lee bringing depth,sadness and charisma to the performance. R.I.P Brandon Lee,you and your acting talent were gone too soon. Rochelle Davis is wonderful as Sarah,Eric's friend. Ernie Hudsen is terrific as Sergeant Albrecht,a cop that helps Eric. Michael Wincott is amazing as Top Dollar,a local crime boss. Anna Thomson is fantastic as Darla,Sarah's drug addicted Mother. David Patrick Kelly(T-Bird),Angel David(Skank),Laurence Mason(Tin Tin)and Michael Masse(Funboy)do great jobs as Top Dollar's henchmen. Jon Polito is outstanding and funny as Gideon,a pawn shop owner. Sofia Shinas is beautiful and memorable as Shelly,Eric's fiancé. Tony Todd(Grange),Bai Ling(Myca) and Marco Rodriguez(Torres)give good performances as well. The direction by Alex Ployas is brilliant and stylish,with Ployas always moving the camera giving the film a dark and grim visual style to the film. Amazing direction,Ployas.The score by Graeme Revell is terrific,haunting and unforgettable and adds to the tone of the film. Great score,Revell. There is also an amazing soundtrack with songs by Nine Inch Nails(Dead Souls),Stone Temple Pilots(Big Empty),The Cure(Burn),Pantera(The Badge),Rage Against The Machine(Darkness),Rollins Band(Ghostrider),Medicine(Time Baby III)and more. Fantastic soundtrack.In final word,if you love Action Films or Comic Book Movies,I highly suggest you see The Crow,an excellent,stylish Comic adaptation and classic that you can watch again and again and belongs in every movie lover's collection. Highly Recommended. 10\/10. ","genre":"Action, Drama, Fantasy"},{"date":"8 December 2013","score":"","review":" The Crow is an excellent,stylish and haunting classic and one of the greatest Comic Book films ever made that's filled amazing direction,a brilliant,unforgettable final performance from Brandon Lee,a great cast,thrilling Action,beautiful photography,a terrific score and Rock soundtrack. All of those elements make The Crow a Cult Classic and a powerful movie experience.Based on James O'Barr Comic Book Series and Comic Strip and set in Detroit,Michigan,The Crow tells the story of Eric Draven(Brandon Lee),a rock musician who along with his fiancée Shelly(Sofia Shinas)were assaulted and murdered by a group of thugs on Devil's Night,the night before Halloween. A year later after the murder,Eric is brought back from the grave to get revenge on the killers who murdered him and his fiancée and wants vengeance at all costs.Released in 1994,The Crow is brilliant and powerful film that came out a year after the tragic death of Brandon Lee(the son of the late,great legendary Martial Arts\/Kung-Fu Icon Bruce Lee)who died on the set after an unfortunate accident while making the film. Although Brandon Lee's death loomed over the movie,The Crow became a critical and box office success and also became a Cult Film thanks to Brandon Lee's final performance and is seen as one of the best Comic Book films ever made. The Crow is an amazing film that right from the beginning pulls into a dark,Gothic nightmare that is grim and gloomy and looks like a Graphic novel coming to life with beauty and ugliness but is also a movie that is Action-packed and visually stunning and when you see The Crow the first time it will blow your mind. The Crow is a film that deals with themes such as tragedy,death,revenge and love which gives the movie a sadness that surrounds the film's atmosphere as well as the characters which gives The Crow depth and substance. Another thing I love about The Crow is the style and look of the movie thanks to the beautiful camera work and lighting by Dariusz Wolski. Wolski's photography and lighting gives The Crow a great and unique look that is in the style of Film Noir and Dystopian with rainy streets and buildings that are in the dark with the movie almost giving the film a timeless quality that combines the look of Tim Burton's Batman and Ridley Scott's Blade Runner because with The Crow you as a viewer don't know if it's the past,present or future. The Crow is also in the style of Film Noir with the characters attitudes which are cynical and bleak with no happy ending satisfaction. The main character Eric Draven is one of the best characters in a comic book film because even though Draven is back from the dead and looking for revenge he has depth and sympathy while having good(Draven's time with Shelly)and bad memories(him and Shelly's murder)which gives Draven and the film great power because what The Crow tells viewers even when you're dead a person still has a memory. Eric Draven is a character who represents the dark and gloomy tone and when he is off the screen you can feel Draven's presence because he represents violence,death and darkness. Eric Draven is a incredible character that you will never forget and is a character that will forever be a Cult icon and a classic anti hero that is timeless and for the ages. The Action scenes in The Crow are fantastic and done with a great pace and style which is fierce and at times brutal but if you are an Action movie lover the Action will have you foaming at the mouth and will keep glued to the screen with Action scenes of intensity,great excitement and explosive thrills.

I remember there being a lot of hype back then, a lot of Oscar buzz, a lot of people saying it was the best film ever made.

A lot of years and a lot of movies have passed by since then, and it's fair to say that American BEAUTY doesn't quite live up to all that initial hype. It's starting to date very slightly these days. It's still very good, but it's not quite the masterpiece I remembered.What it is is an effective and extremely black comedy that attempts to skewer the typical, suburban American family. Of course, that conceit is highly familiar - DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES got eight or so years out of quiet and not-so-quite desperation - but American BEAUTY handles it with aplomb. It helps that the excellent Kevin Spacey takes the lead role, and nobody else could have quite grasped the intricacies of his character like he does. Plus he makes his deadbeat lead sympathetic despite his myriad flaws.The movie works due to its quirky characters, all of whom are difficult to pigeonhole. The twists come a-plenty, particularly towards the climax, and all of them are decent, as are many of the players. I do find it something of a shame that Wes Bentley, Thora Birch, Mena Suvari and Chris Cooper never went on to make much of themselves given that they were all on very strong form here, although the less said about Annette Bening's histrionic turn, the better.

The fact that it's set during Christmas or that the movie itself is about Christmas? I personally believe that the movie's message is as important as how much fake snow is laying about the set and amazingly, this iconic picture remained unwatched until yesterday. But what better film is there to get one feeling all festive? This is a heady cocktail of festive spirit, comedic satire and morality tale in the finest tradition of Charles Dickins and frankly, even a stone-hearted cynic like myself had to wipe my eyes away as the cast gathered to sing Auld Lang Syne at the end. There are plenty of reasons why this remains the definitive Christmas movie.James Stewart plays George Bailey, unassuming everyman who can never quite live the adventurous life he wants. Cursed to living in the sleepy town of Bedford Falls, he ekes out a living at his late father's building & loan company at the expense of a more lavish lifestyle for his wife Mary (Donna Reid) and their four children while giving the townspeople some respite from the financial might of local scrooge Mr Potter (Lionel Barrymore). But when his business partner Uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell) loses their last $8000 on Christmas Eve, despondent George is tipped over the edge and he finds himself at a bridge, staring into the icy waters below with dark thoughts in his head. But when an angel with no wings called Clarence (Henry Travers) is dispatched to intervene, he shows George how life in Bedford Falls would have been if George had never been born.Feeling like a cross between A Christmas Carol and The Shawshank Redemption, It's A Wonderful Life is probably the most powerful fable I've seen all year. Most of the film is spent building up the goody-two-shoes nature of George and watching his inevitable decline is harrowing and heart-breaking. But the film has plenty of laughs in there as well such as the moment Mary finds herself in an awkward spot behind a bush to the Charleston that ends up in a swimming pool. The other reason you completely buy into the story is Stewart - you can see and feel the pain as his world crumbles around him and his unmitigated joy once he realises the error of his ways provides the film with one of the most uplifting endings I can ever recall seeing. Stewart is the picture, even though he doesn't convince during the scenes when George is at his high school graduation (considering how much taller he was than everyone else, you'd think he'd been held back by seven years!). And if you were being picky, you might argue that some of the characters aren't as well defined as others (such as George's co-workers) and the colourised version is apparently pretty poor as Stewart himself reckoned that it made him feel sick.But it's Christmas and now is not the time for petty criticism - this remains the benchmark that every Christmas film since has aspired to and falls so far short that it's embarrassing. Stuff like Santa Claus The Movie or Elf have all the jingle bells you'd ever need but none of the magic. It's A Wonderful Life is not just the greatest Christmas film ever made but also a fabulous movie in its own right, a fantastically inspiring film that sends you on an emotional roller-coaster before bringing a lump to your throat and a tear to your eye. It might not be terribly original or even plausible but watching it warms you up like a hot toddy after trudging through the snow and surely, that's the point.

To sum up some elements of the film that were lame to the point of insanity. Richard (Dicaprio) comes across a crazy dude who gives him a map. He speaks of this tropical beach paradise, never mind the small society who occupies it or the marijuana fields guarded by dudes with machine guns. It couldn't be too great, it drove this dude crazy. Perhaps he too had to stand guard for a period of time in solitude, which is what will later drive Richard crazy for a selective period of time on the beach. Which leads us to another significant point of nonsense. So Richard gives a copy of the map to some surfer tourist dudes he meets while in Bangkok prior to himself knowing for sure if the place exists (not a problem). So why doesn't Richard just say to the psycho chick; witch, I gave them the copy of the map prior to knowing as to whether or not this place existed. How the hell was I supposed to know that their would be a small secret society who wanted it to keep the beach a secret? Anyways, for whatever reason the surfer dudes sit on the map for approx several months before they decide to seek out the beach.

The period of time that Richard has to keep watch is unknown, but leads one to believe that it's several days to weeks. Why would the surfer dudes camp out for days to weeks across from their beach destination? They can't possibly be afraid of the swim they have surfboards for Fk sake. Anywho, there is so much ridiculousness in the movie I realize that it would be extremely lengthy to point it all out. But yes, it fails on every level. It's has no direction\/pointless and it's just plain silly. All of which I could overlook if it wasn't also extremely boring. Even the beach paradise seems boring. This movie is so bad that it's almost worth watching, just to laugh at how awful and nonsensical it is. It's not quite Troll 2 or The Room, but it's not far from it.

Disney's Cinderella is certainly a cultural icon.And that's really unfortunate for our culture.

Disney's Cinderella appears to be an unwilling captive in a situation so bad we cannot understand why she does not run away she IS shown to be of at least moderately illustrious ascendancy and surely she could at least start out in a more worthy setting somewhere else before her masters take note that she's perhaps issue of an education not quite comparable to that of the other scullery maids?Charles Perrault's Cinderella was rather clearer on this point. Cinderella loved her father and even though his second wife and stepdaughters were cruel to her, she stayed behind to look after them out of love for her father, knowing he wanted his two families to love each other and to meld together. This is made clear at the first ball (in the Disney version, there is only one, and the story is robbed of commensurate death) the prince takes notice of Cinderella and gives her a plateau of oranges and lemons (a rarity in 17th-century France), and she immediately finds her stepsisters and shares the dessert with them. The message is that Cinderella had it all to move up in the world, deep interior beauty as well as outer beauty, and just a little bit of divine intervention (through her fairy godmother) cleaned up and allowed people to look past an otherwise soot-laden exterior.

While a lot of the dialogue stayed true to the book (which I read an abridged version of), it had elements of typical Muppet humour and the cameos from Animal and Swedish Chef were absolutely hilarious as was the 'Heatwave' performance in Scrooge's workplace and the part where Dickens lights Rizzo's tail by mistake. The first song is the most memorable. While the rest were initially forgettable, they were pleasant enough with a touch of festive spirit. The whimsical if somewhat generic incidental music had its Christmassy charms as well and the voice acting for the Muppets stayed in line with that from the original Muppet Show despite Kermit's voice actor having changed. Gonzo was perfect as Dickens to narrate the story while Kermit and Miss Piggy provided top-notch support as Bob and Emily Cratchit respectively.All in all this is one of three of my favourite adaptations of the classic Dickens novel, the other two being 'Mickey's Christmas Carol' and the version starring Jim Carrey that has a similar design to 'The Polar Express' and it's still a joy to watch over Christmas. 9\/10.

The first song is the most memorable. While the rest were initially forgettable, they were pleasant enough with a touch of festive spirit. The whimsical if somewhat generic incidental music had its Christmassy charms as well and the voice acting for the Muppets stayed in line with that from the original Muppet Show despite Kermit's voice actor having changed. Gonzo was perfect as Dickens to narrate the story while Kermit and Miss Piggy provided top-notch support as Bob and Emily Cratchit respectively.All in all this is one of three of my favourite adaptations of the classic Dickens novel, the other two being 'Mickey's Christmas Carol' and the version starring Jim Carrey that has a similar design to 'The Polar Express' and it's still a joy to watch over Christmas. 9\/10.
