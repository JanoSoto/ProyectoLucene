I can't recall precisely what I didn't like about it, that first viewing being maybe a decade or so ago, but I seem to remember finding it a little confusing and I can remember not being a fan of the special effects (some would consider that last statement heresy). But watching it a second time, I enjoyed it immensely. I wouldn't place it at the top of the genre like some people would, but it wouldn't be far off.First things first, I appreciated the special effects a lot more this time round. I think the problem when I first watched it was just how bizarre it all was. Tentacles? Bloody flower guts? Giant snapping mouths? Maybe I found it hard to suspend my disbelief, or perhaps I found it repulsive &#150; I don't mind gore in horror films, but I'm not a fan of what I'd call 'gloop' (for some reason I can happily watch limbs get blown and sawn off, or see people get shot, stabbed and eaten, but my sick trigger is sensitive to 'gloopy' film monsters &#150; I love David Cronenberg's version of The Fly, even though it does make my stomach turn in a couple of places, but I do actually come close to gagging watching The Fly II, and not just because it's cinematic manure). So perhaps I didn't appreciate the special effects for those reasons. But they're actually pretty great. One of the best bits has to be when an imitation human head sprouts a tentacle from its mouth and pulls itself along &#150; and earlier on when the head begins to detach itself from its body. It's nasty and unpleasant and great to watch. And then there's the bit when Palmer's face rips apart and a giant alien mouth sprouts and bites a guy in the head. Neat. (And to make it even better, the man who's getting bitten is shaken from side to side, and in a couple of shots it's obviously a dummy&#133;which is amusing.) But not all the special effects work is great. Although I love the head being ripped off and I love it when it shoots a tentacle from its mouth, it does look silly rather than disturbing when it sprouts antennae and spidery legs. There's a fine line between great and crap. And the bit at the end isn't particularly impressive either &#150; the bit where we see huge tentacles and a massive monster. It's overkill and the effects don't match what has come before.Much better than all the big stuff are the little bits. Right at the end, right before the silly tentacle business and the unconvincing alien dog, is a bit where Garry encounters an assimilated Blair and Blair sticks his hand in his head. It's brilliantly done. And then after that you see Blair dragging Garry along by his face. Again it's sick and nasty, but in a much more believable way.However, it's not the monster that makes The Thing such an enjoyable film, it's the confusion and the paranoia that its presence generates in the humans (I guess when I first watched it as a kid I didn't realise that confusion was the point). After all, seeing as The Thing is a shape-shifter, and it can take on any form, everyone's a suspect.This climate of paranoia and suspicion is best illustrated in the scene where MacReady (Kurt Russell) ties the surviving scientists and workers to chairs so that he can check their blood to see who's human and who's not. The scene really is tense, as you haven't got a clue who's been assimilated and who hasn't. You're not even sure if MacReady is who he says he is, as even he's been built up as a suspect. But it literally could be anybody and the scene's a powder keg.Another great scene is when MacReady declares that he knows for certain he's human and the camera slowly pans across the rest of the group. Do we believe him, and who among the group isn't what he says he is? As well as the scenes of tension, I love the creepy moments too (they're often a lot better than the 'scary' bits). My favourite is when a half assimilated Bennings is caught trying to escape the camp (he's almost a perfect copy but his hands are deformed) and he lets off an eerie howl before he's burnt to a crisp (there's a lot of torching in the film&#133;which I love!). And there's also the bit where MacReady visits Blair, who's been locked in the tool shed. MacReady opens a slit and Blair's sitting there by a noose while eating cans of food. He then begs to be let out. He insists that he's much better. It's a superb scene. And as simple as they are, I love all the lingering shots of the dog. It's a creepy mutt, I tell you. It's got a thousand yard stare.Also rather creepy is the ending. After all the pyrotechnics, MacReady thinks he's the sole survivor, only Childs shows up. His explanation is that he got lost in the snow. There's a bit of an awkward conversation, and even though Mac kind of knows that it isn't the real Childs, he's become tired and resigned to his fate and shares a smoke. It's an ending that, in the best way, keeps you wondering.And on a final note, I must say how much I enjoy Mac's snow-sombrero and his bad geography.

This film achieves more than its relatively low budget should ever have provided. If the project had been given to any other director then I doubt that the film would have been this good. The zombies are few and far between, but that only serves to add to the level of suspense and the sense of impending doom. The title is in the style of the B Movies of the 50's, but that is quite obviously deliberate and can therefore be excused.The concept behind the movie is both thought-provoking and terrifying. What would any of us do if everyone disappeared over night and the only people left behind were out to kill us? The choice of the type of disaster is perfect because it creates an inescapable Apocalypse, but at the same time it leaves everything in good repair. This makes the film far better than other post-apocalyptic films which all start with a disaster that turns the world into a messy and dangerous place. The great thing about Night of The Comet is that right from the beginning it is quite obvious that if the central characters can survive for long enough, they will have everything they need to start all over again. Even the zombies have a shelf life and as the film progresses it becomes quite obvious that eventually the world will be a safe place once more (unlike the Night of The Living Dead saga where it is the case that the zombies will be around for a very long time).The really great thing with Night Of The Comet is that it plays to the child in all of us. (I can't be the only person to have imagined what it would be like to be let loose in a city without anyone to stop me from going on an endless shopping trip without the need for any cash). Well, in Night Of The Comet, there are some truly excellent scenes of deserted shops, and the two central characters take full advantage of the freedom of being able to take whatever they want (without having to worry about being shot for looting). However, the one thing the characters forget is that the world is populated by some very nasty zombies, but that just adds to the suspense.Over all, this movie is a monument to the fact that film companies do not need huge budgets to make truly fantastic horror films.

I've heard of despicable adaptations, but The Flintstones is a level all on its own! Featuring Fred (John Goodman) becoming an executive while slimy deals are going on, the movie makes you feel like you died and went to the hottest part of Hell. Worse still, this God-awful excuse for a movie started a trend of dreadful movie adaptations of TV shows Mission Impossible, Lost in Space (although the show apparently sucked to begin with), The Avengers, The Mod Squad, Rocky and Bullwinkle, Scooby Doo, I Spy, The Honeymooners (although the show apparently sucked to begin with) and Bewitched; it's a pure fluke that the movie versions of The Addams Family, The Beverly Hillbillies, The Brady Bunch and Charlie's Angels were worth watching (although the same can't always be said for sequels my dad saw Charlie's Angels Full Throttle on an airplane and called it one of the ten worst movies that he'd ever seen). To add insult to injury, there was that Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas (which, thankfully, I never saw); John Waters's Cecil B. Demented made a joke about it.All in all, this just may be the worst movie ever. I know that it's hard to say, given that there are so many bad movies, but it's certainly up there. They wasted the talents of Goodman, Elizabeth Perkins, Rick Moranis, Rosie O'Donnell, Halle Berry, Kyle MacLachlan, and Jonathan Winters. And how did Elizabeth Taylor end up this swill? Not that she was one of the greatest actresses to begin with.In conclusion, I hear that they're making a Get Smart movie with Steve Carell. I guess that we should keep an open mind, but there's more reason to be suspicious than to be anticipatory. And furthermore, THERE HAD BETTER NOT BE MOVIE VERSIONS OF I Love Lucy, Mister Ed, Gilligan's Island, I Dream of Jeannie, The Flying Nun, All in the Family, Sanford and Son, Happy Days, and Three's Company!

The movie takes play in a tiny town called Anarene, Texas and takes place between World War 2 and the Korean conflict. Sonny Crawford who is played by Timothy Bottoms is the main character and his best friend Duane Jackson played by actor Jeff Bridges go through the small town as teenagers and go through the ups and downs of normal teenage lives. The two boys played on the local high school team and were the talk of the town, only in the bad sense. Throughout the movie we saw many of the old timers stop the boys and harass them about how bad they were doing. We see when Duane and Sonny are throwing the bag of quarters around the street like their playing football. Then they get stopped in front of a few of these older guys who make fun and poke jokes at them, saying they could catch but couldn't throw a block to save their life.We see Sonny as a young adult struggling to find what he is really looking for, which right now seems to be either love or lust. His coach told him if he drove his wife to the clinic that Sonny could get out of school for a little bit. He ends up by taking her and she offers him back in for a soda. She breaks down right in front of the boy and he is taking back by her emotions and isn't sure what to do. From the start we can see these two people have a physical attraction towards one another. Sonny finds out from her that she isn't really seeing the coach anymore. When this is found out Sonny and her start to have an affair with one another. Each week when Sonny was suppose to be driving her to the clinic, he was actually going over there to make love instead. It reminded me a little of Mrs. Robinson in the move The Graduate.

While these people are strangers to many, during one day, their lives intersect with others. During this one day, they question their lives, the lies and deception they hold, the forgiveness of their loved one, meaning to their lives, and the happiness they all sorely and blindly seek. Coincidence and chance are strange facets of life. As these people encounter one another, are these meetings by chance, or this there a benevolent force at work; is it fate that their lives crossed with another.

Julianne Moore does a great job, though its saddening to seeing only one type of emotion from her the entire film. William H. Macy also shines, though he character doesn't receive much screen time.

From the beginning to the end, no part of the Superman mythos is left uncovered. The destruction of Krypton, the Fortress of Solitude, Lois Lane, Lana Lang, Jor-El, Pa Kent's death. There's really not much more they could have packed into 2 and a half hours.Directed by Richard Donner (The Goonies) and starring Chris Reeves (not really known for anything else), and written by none other than Mario Puzo. Already you know you're in for some excitement. Then you add Marlon Brando and the guy from The Limey as General Zod (who I look forward to seeing in future Superman movies). I should admit at this point I'm unclear why they paid Brano the insane amount of money they did for his role in this film. It could have been played by anyone -- even Brian Dennehy.Jimmy Olsen comes off as being an even bigger loser than in the comics, which saddens me. Margot Kidder is an average Lois Lane, but it really makes me wonder why they chose an actress who is not attractive, can't sing and put her in some of the most hideous outfits ever worn by leading lady. Further, why can't Lois Lane spell anything correctly? She's been a budding journalist since she was 12, basic words like massacre shouldn't make her uncomfortable.Meanwhile, Lex Luthor gets the finest woman in the film. Luthor, by the way, played by Gene Hackman. Hackman does this perfectly - the mad genius, the eccentricity. Perfection. What I love about this movie is how they kept the plot and characters fun and light-hearted, yet at the same time they didn't turn it into a campy, kitschy lovefest like the old Batman film and show. Could this be Hackman's finest role? Oh, I think it might.If Suoerman fights for truth, justice and the American Way, what happens when these things contradict each other? The ending, which I won't reveal here, has some serious problems. I enjoyed it, but it really makes you -- forces you -- to suspend your belief in reality and give Superman basically unlimited powers. But, you know, it's a comic. Highly recommended for good, clean family fun and something extra for the kids or the child at heart.

It could have been played by anyone -- even Brian Dennehy.Jimmy Olsen comes off as being an even bigger loser than in the comics, which saddens me. Margot Kidder is an average Lois Lane, but it really makes me wonder why they chose an actress who is not attractive, can't sing and put her in some of the most hideous outfits ever worn by leading lady. Further, why can't Lois Lane spell anything correctly? She's been a budding journalist since she was 12, basic words like massacre shouldn't make her uncomfortable.Meanwhile, Lex Luthor gets the finest woman in the film. Luthor, by the way, played by Gene Hackman. Hackman does this perfectly - the mad genius, the eccentricity. Perfection. What I love about this movie is how they kept the plot and characters fun and light-hearted, yet at the same time they didn't turn it into a campy, kitschy lovefest like the old Batman film and show. Could this be Hackman's finest role? Oh, I think it might.If Suoerman fights for truth, justice and the American Way, what happens when these things contradict each other? The ending, which I won't reveal here, has some serious problems. I enjoyed it, but it really makes you -- forces you -- to suspend your belief in reality and give Superman basically unlimited powers. But, you know, it's a comic. Highly recommended for good, clean family fun and something extra for the kids or the child at heart.

I have seen the movie many times and every time I see it, I realize it has a fascinating blend of all facets of movie making.Generally when one talks about this movie, the focus is on the directorial misadventure or brilliance to run the movie backwards and forwards to converge somewhere but I have strongly felt that this is only one of the many beautiful things the crew of Memento have done to this great movie. I would like to discuss some other amazing feature ignored by many critics.Memento is a story of a guy who has lost his power to retain and create new memories after an incident. So basically, this movie revolves around this guy Lenny and his quest to exist in a world where his condition is almost an exception. But since one needs a reason to carry on the ventures of daily existence and since Lenny has no way of remembering these reasons, so he invents some extraordinary techniques to remember them - taking photographs and writing notes on his body. He tends to create opportunities and forget that he created them and that the reasons he has created are not a consequence of natural course of life. The movie not only brilliantly explores the agony and pain of a person suffering of such a condition but it also describes the journey of this person to fight all odds and still exist in a world without time but only matter.The incident, which happens to be the last memory of his, is compelling him to exist but only till he finds the man responsible for it and kills him. Lennys knows that after he has killed the man, he would loose the reason to live and so he practices the great gift given to him-the ability to forget.Christopher Nolan has displayed that story telling is the most important part of movie making. He has successfully brought all the faces cinematic experience in one masterpiece.If movies mean anything to you, you have to see this one.

However, before briefly discussing the film, let me just say if you don't have a decent 5.1 surround sound system, you aren't going to fully appreciate this movie (DVD).It's a great film to start with, and sitting in a room surrounded by five speakers with bullets flying from all directions around you - as in that spectacular 22- minute opening scene or in the final 45 minutes of action against the Germans in tanks - is an astounding movie experience. The sound in this film elevates it even higher.The visuals are outstanding, too. I've never seen so many grays, beiges and olive-greens look this good perfect colors for the bombed-out French city where the last hour takes place, perfect for the faces and uniforms of the gritty soldiers, for the machinery, the smoke-filled skies, etc.My only complaint is the usage of Lord's name in vain 25-30 times, but, hey, when you consider it's tough men in tough times, that's what you are going to hear. In real life, the profanity probably was worse than the film. It's hard to picture the brutality of war being any worse than you see here, but it probably was. This is about as graphic as it gets. The violence and gore was shocking when this film came out in 1997 and still is when watched almost a decade later. It's unbelievable what some of the WWII soldiers went through, but that can be said for any war. I believe the purpose of this film was to pay tribute to the sacrifices these men made, and it succeeds wonderfully. Hats off to Steven Spielberg and to Tom Hanks, the leading actor in here, both of whom have worked hard for WWII vets to get the recognition they deserve, not just on film but in a national memorial.Anyway, language or blood and guts aside, this is still an incredible portrait of WWII. The almost-three hour film is riveting start-to-finish, especially with that memorable beginning action scene, probably the most dramatic in the history of film.As entertaining as those action scenes were, I found the lulls, if you will, to be even better. Listening to Hanks and his men discuss various things as they look for Private Ryan, was fascinating to me. Hanks is just superb in here and once again shows why he is considered one of the best actors in his generation.The most memorable and powerful moment among the lulls, is the shot early on of the Ryan mother sinking to her knees on her front porch as she realizes she is about to get disastrous news from the war. Moments later, Harve Presenell, playing Gen. MacArthur, eloquently reads a letter by Abraham Lincoln that is so beautifully written, so profound that it is quoted near the end of the film, too, and I never get tired of hearing it.This is a man's movie, and shows the horrors of war as few others ever have.

The lead character Scarlett is thoroughly offputting - bitchy spoiled, without real intelligence (beyond a good business sense, I suppose that's a nicer name for greed). Melanie is so very good you can't possibly believe or like her, most of the other characters not worth much attention either. The only half likable person was Rhett Butler; no, not for his masculinity (heroic males are bad enough, but needy useless females flocking around them are worse). No it's because he essentially respects nothing and doesn't take part in the pretentiousness of the time.As for the film, the acting was on the whole so ludicrously poor that the participants of a school play would be hard put to be less convincing. Again Rhett Butler's character is the only one you can believe and enjoy watching (the scene where they have to leave Atlanta, and he turns up saying I hear you want to take a trip just ideally portrays his laid back coolness). Other than that characters from the book which help you understand the setting are missing. For example the gossipping spying busybodies in Atlanta. Not that that sort deserves any airtime, but those small-minded essentially unoccupied women just set the general tone and illustrate the mentality. On the other hand I'm tempted to speculate if the seeming falseness of the film actors is in fact a faithful portrayal of those times. Even in the book nobody is ever straight forward, so maybe the lack of believability in the film quite accurately represents the general hypocrisy of that society.Either way, it is beyond me to understand why everyone is so moved by this story.

This is a light movie that asks you to just sit back and enjoy. It has been totally over-analyzed. I saw the movie for the first time in about 20 years last night, and it put a smile on my face for the rest of the night. Lee Marvin is fantastic in his dual role. His facial expressions are classic, and his behavior at the funeral had me howling! Sittin on his horse leaning against the wall was an image I can't get out of my head. You should see them from my side is one of the classic lines in a movie! I couldn't take my eyes off Jane Fonda, she was remarkably beautiful in this movie. The rest of the cast was fun, especially Dwayne Hickman as the uncle.Every movie made does not have to tell a story or have some deep meaning.

The actors play is magnificent! Hope is what we need most! Redemption is just a word like every other word. In a corrupt system, hope never dies. Andy is not only just a smart guy. He takes advantage of the whole corrupt system. There were and there will always exist innocent people in jail. How you can prove your innocence is a matter of common sense which is not evenly distributed. Hope is always needed as long as corruption never end. When hope dies, everything else dies slowly. And in the end a question what would one like Andy do not in 1966, but in 2006. Could he still get into prison, could he still escape, could he still take financial advantage over the system? I hope he could! ","genre":null},{"date":"27 February 2006","score":"","review":" Excellent movie! I've seen it for several times but I can't stop watching it. It's memorable!

And I mean, DOG SH*T. Aside from the gratuitous spraying of curse words for the hell of it, the characters are paper thin caricatures of clichéd action film personalities. What was up with Willem Dafoes character? Why not just tattoo badass experienced cop guy on his forehead? And him rippin' on the rookie cop cliché? Ha-ha, Dafoe makes fun of the rookie for no reason. Ugh...Ridiculous.And that what are you a fag?! line... Was that supposed to make me laugh?!And I didn't question my ethics and morals by the end of the film. These characters said they were on a mission from God. People who are on missions from God are CRAZY. Always. Yes, them too. So, yes, they're wrong. No, really, they are. Ugh, what a crappy movie. I cannot believe it has the rating it does. Are these the people who voted for Armageddon and Independence Day?To sum it up, this movie just feels so lazy to me. Desperado was a vigilante film, but at least it had better characters than this. C'mon people, you seriously have to reconsider the high score.PS That reenactment\/flashback scene in the house after the shootout was pretty badass though. Very well choreographed and shot!

","genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller"},{"date":"27 February 2006","score":"","review":" This movie is a fantastic gem that has been completely destroyed by critics and overlooked even by most Peter Jackson fans. Unfortunately this film seems to be unfairly treated as a juvenile attempt at shock value or gross-out comedy, with most critics completely ignoring the satire. Kubrick made how many films prominently featuring satire and the grotesque? Easily we could look at just A Clockwork Orange and Full Metal Jacket and ask are those films juvenile gross out comedies? No, those films are classic statements about the direction that humanity is heading, and so is Meet the Feebles. Peter Jackson took a Muppets-ish satire and made an allegory about the ills of Hollywood and excess in the entertainment industry. Jackson tackles not only the ills of the entertainment industry, but also the ills in general of living in our modern society where people are used as commodities in every facet of life. That he accomplished such sharp criticism using a Muppets-esquire parody is an amazing accomplishment, and for that he deserves a place alongside other satiric luminaries like Kubrick and Vonnegut. My only complaint is that Jackson hasn't made more films in this tone, and instead went on to direct an epic stack of boredom after this.For an underground film fan, this one of the better (non-campy) things to come out of the 80's. Peter Jackson my hats off to you. I don't quite understand how someone can go from this movie and Bad Taste to the blockbuster Lord of the Rings trilogy, but the epic proportions of LOTR are somewhat foreshadowed here. Do yourself a favor, rent the Feebles on VHS so you get all the grimy gritty texture that the film's subjects deserve. If they ever re-release this film I just hope they do a promotional tie-in with stuffed animals of the characters, specifically Wubot (Robert). He has worked his way into my heart, the lovable lil fella.
