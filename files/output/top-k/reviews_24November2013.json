The NYPD then receive a call from a gentleman called 'Simon' (Jeremy Irons) who says that he wants them to send John McClane to 128th Street. The problem for the NYPD is that McClane has been suspended and therefore they initially refuse to co-operate. However, Simon says (no pun intended) that if they don't comply that another building will get blown up. Reluctantly, they agree to Simon's demands and send in John McClane. McClane isn't keen to help out - mainly due to him suffering a bad hangover - he's not exactly been using his time constructively and has almost turned into an alcoholic (this is most probably as a result of the breakdown of his marriage to Holly). Zeus (Samuel L Jackson) ends up an unwilling partner with McClane when he unknowingly interferes in Simon's plans when McClane is stood in Harlem wearing nothing but a sandwich board with a slogan on it that upsets the locals. Simon is upset that Zeus rescued McClane from certain death and that he interfered with his plans and sees him as an accessory. McClane's inspector Walter (Larry Bryggman) decides to re-instate McClane back into the NYPD and along with Zeus they both try to discover what Simon wants with McClane; *********************SPOILERS FOLLOW*********************************The first big plus with this Die Hard entry is that McTiernan is back at the helm. This was the man that directed the excellent first film. One major strength in this film is the plot - it initially plays out as a standard revenge film (Simon was Hans brother who McClane killed in the first film). However, Simon has more on his mind than just revenge and intends to steal all the gold from the federal reserve bank in New York. Simon tells the police and FBI that he is going to blow up a school in New York if Zeus and McClane don't get to a specified destination in 20 minutes. This was used as a 'distraction' to get all of the police in one place making it easier for him and his men to steal the gold bullion from the Federal Reserve bank.Straight away, this plot has been thought through much more than the rather silly and implausible plot that we saw in the second film.Whilst this is clearly a Die Hard film, it also felt a bit like there was a Lethal Weapon cross over with McClane and Zeus being Riggs and Murtagh respectively - the only difference being that Zeus isn't a police officer. This isn't a criticism it's just merely an observation. As with Riggs and Murtagh, the chemistry was great between McClane and Zeus.The plot is engaging with plenty of twists and turns throughout. What impressed me the most about this entry was the fact that the audience are constantly left guessing; the fact that sometimes Simon was bluffing and sometimes being serious about where the bombs are located was intriguing and really helped to keep my interest. Aside from all this, it was also really entertaining. A lot of the time Simon gave them clues to where the bombs were located in riddles and it was fun seeing how frustrated Zeus and McClane were getting when trying to work out the riddles.Jeremy Irons (like his brother in the first film) was also a great villain. I personally felt Sadler wasn't quite as convincing in the second film.Overall, this is a huge improvement on the second film and is close to being as good as the first film. We have a well thought out plot which is both engaging and plausible. DHWAV is also massively entertaining and Willis and Jackson are both on top form and as I've already mentioned they both work really well together. Do not miss this one!

It was a big hit, so a sequel or two seemed like a no-brainer. And indeed two sequels (so far, at least) were produced. The first of which was 2001's Rush Hour 2. And really, this film is indicative of the problems all three entries in the series face- an over-reliance on clichés, contrivances, coincidences and lazy storytelling. However, whereas the first film was able to rise above a fairly formulaic script and deliver a good film, this sequel isn't quite able to rise above it's almost embarrassingly by-the-numbers screenplay, and comes off as a much more average film than the original.Detective Carter (Tucker) is visiting his friend Detective Lee (Chan) in Hong Kong. While Carter is hoping for a few weeks of fun, food and women, Lee is hard at work on several cases. When a bomb goes off at an American Consulate building in Hong Kong, and it appears that Ricky Tan (John Lone), a man with a dark connection to Lee's past, is connected, Lee and Carter get involved in the case. And it leads to- you guessed it- action, action and more action.To give the film credit where it is due, the acting is uniformly great, much as it was in the original. Chan is given a slightly more personal motivation in the story this time, and it allows him to stretch his acting chops (and his martial arts and stunt work) moreso than the first film. Tucker is a lot of fun, though this film made him into too much of a cartoon character at times. Many people (myself included) have noted that he goes too far and comes off as a bit on the annoying side in this film. But still, he has some great jokes that land, and his chemistry with Chan is undeniable.Supporting roles by the likes of John Lone, Roselyn Sanchez and Harris Yulin are all played well. And Zhang Ziyi as a ruthless, silent assassin is great. While she is almost nothing more than a surrogate for the Sang character in the original film, she is able to give her own spin to the role and plays it well- coming across as savage, sexy and very, very cool.The production is also decent. Brett Ratner's direction is simple, concise and a lot of fun for the most part, although it feels slightly more formulaic this time around. However, the music by Lalo Schifrin is once again a revelation- feeling both old-fashioned yet also modern, giving it a timeless, fun feel. The set and costume design is nice, and the cinematography is fantastic. Setting this film predominately in Hong Kong did allow for some stunning visuals, and it does help.However, the script is where this film really starts to fall apart, and it's the main reason why I am giving this film such a lower rating than I did for the original.The script from the first film did have a problem with clichés, tropes and a formulaic nature, but the script felt creative and fresh enough to elevate itself past this problem, and bring the production to a good level. Not so this time around, sadly. The script by Jeff Nathanson is pretty darned foul. Yes, it's hard to believe that the same man who wrote Spielberg's very fun films Catch Me If You Can and The Terminal was also responsible for the unforgivably lazy Rush Hour 2. (And Rush Hour 3, but more on that in a later review)I don't know if it was fear on Nathanson's part to take any chances, or perhaps studio pressure to deliver a safe, formulaic film, but the script is bad. Really bad. Jokes are often lowest-common-denominator. You can see every twist and turn from a mile away. Characters are completely undeveloped beyond being good guys or bad guys. It spends too much time referencing the first film. It's just a lazy, lazy script. You don't even need to see the film to know what happens. Just think of any other buddy cop movie, and substitute in Chan and Tucker, and you have Rush Hour 2.And it's a shame, because it's the one big problem in an otherwise decent sequel. Thankfully, the good performances and the chemistry between Chan and Tucker are able to pretty much make up for this issue. But just barely.Rush Hour 2 gets a slightly above average 6 out of 10 from me. Fans of the original should check it out, but don't go in expecting much.

Jude Law co stars as a hit man hired to kill Sullivan.This is my second time watching this movie. I saw this when it was first released, and remember that it was a powerful movie. I gave it another whirl last night, and it still holds up. This movie is set in the 1930's, and I felt the atmosphere mirrored the time period precisely, from the cars, the houses, the style of clothing, and just how everything was done. It has a very rich atmosphere that was very hard to resist. The patient storytelling serves this movie well. It's deliberately paced, and better for it. I felt the deliberate pacing gave us a chance to get to know the characters a little more, especially in the second half, watching Tom Hanks & Tyler Hoechlin (Michael Sullivan Jr.) get to know each other a little more. As their relationship grows, the movie really begins to heat up. Tom Hanks is fantastic in the lead; Hanks has consistently proved for many years how good he is, and he delivers one of his best performances here. His character is cold & tough in the first half, before opening up a bit more in the second half when he becomes a bit more humane. He conveyed his emotions to perfection. He's not completely ruthless, and he has a heart, so sympathy was automatic from me. Tyler Hoechlin impresses as the kid. Not only was his narration terrific, but so was his acting. Jude Law is effectively smarmy as the hit-man. Paul Newman can peel potatoes for an hour, and I'd call it a good performance. He doesn't have a ton of screen time, but he was excellent and classy. Jennifer Jason Leigh doesn't have much to do as the wife, whilst Daniel Craig is great as a weaselFinal Thoughts If you can handle the deliberate pace, you will be rewarded with great storytelling. The acting is top notch, and it will definitely make you think for a bit after it's over.

This movie is set in the 1930's, and I felt the atmosphere mirrored the time period precisely, from the cars, the houses, the style of clothing, and just how everything was done. It has a very rich atmosphere that was very hard to resist. The patient storytelling serves this movie well. It's deliberately paced, and better for it. I felt the deliberate pacing gave us a chance to get to know the characters a little more, especially in the second half, watching Tom Hanks & Tyler Hoechlin (Michael Sullivan Jr.) get to know each other a little more. As their relationship grows, the movie really begins to heat up. Tom Hanks is fantastic in the lead; Hanks has consistently proved for many years how good he is, and he delivers one of his best performances here. His character is cold & tough in the first half, before opening up a bit more in the second half when he becomes a bit more humane. He conveyed his emotions to perfection. He's not completely ruthless, and he has a heart, so sympathy was automatic from me. Tyler Hoechlin impresses as the kid. Not only was his narration terrific, but so was his acting. Jude Law is effectively smarmy as the hit-man. Paul Newman can peel potatoes for an hour, and I'd call it a good performance. He doesn't have a ton of screen time, but he was excellent and classy. Jennifer Jason Leigh doesn't have much to do as the wife, whilst Daniel Craig is great as a weaselFinal Thoughts If you can handle the deliberate pace, you will be rewarded with great storytelling.

And it is pretty incredible that looking back over a decade later, the film still holds up not only in terms of great humor and good performances, but also from a stylistic and craftsmanship standpoint. The film has an oddly timeless feeling, adding much to its appeal and charm as one of the better Buddy Cop films to emerge in the past 20 years.Chan stars as Detective Inspector Lee, a Hong Kong Police Officer who is brought to the US to help his friend, a Chinese Consul whose daughter has been kidnapped. However, the FBI, not wanting to deal with Lee, instead trick loud-mouthed and reckless Los Angeles Detective James Carter (Chris Tucker) into becoming Lee's babysitter to keep him out of trouble. However, Lee's steadfast dedication to his duty soon brings the two mis-matched officers back into the case, and they realize they may be the only one's capable of saving the kidnapped child.Chan and Tucker's performances and chemistry are the beating heart of the film, and are what makes it function and come off so well. Chan is renowned over the world for his incredible martial-arts and stunt sequences, and this film is no exception to that. (Although I will contend that this is one of his tamer films in terms of stunts, although he still does some amazing things in it) But what many people seem to ignore is that he is a great, expressive actor with a Chaplin or Buster Keaton-like appeal and style. Chan is a joy to watch in this film, and he is able to deliver the thrills, laughs and suspense perfectly. Tucker is also a lot of fun as a wise-cracking, loud-mouthed, and foolhardy detective Carter. He does have a lot of good laughs, and is able to bring a balance to the table against Chan's more stoic style. He's also a lot more zany and almost cartoonish, which balances well with Chan's almost silent-film quality. The two actors compliment each other perfectly in this film, and are a joy to see together.Other performances are good all around. Tom Wilkinson pulls a great role as British Commander. Tzi Ma is sympathetic as the father of the kidnapped child, and grounds the film quite nicely, keeping the story centered and with an emotional core. Ken Leung is great as Sang, an eerie, stoic villain. Elizabeth Pena is a lot of fun as Carter's fellow officer. Everyone meshes well in this movie.Production-wise, the film is fantastic. While director Ratner's reputation has been tarnished slightly in recent years due to some controversies and a few poorly received films, he is still a talented visual artist, and his choice of shots, compositions, etc. is top notch here. The one thing I will admit that I enjoy about Ratner's direction is that he tends to present things in a timeless, clean and well- composed way. He doesn't rely on cheap tricks or trendy camera work to tell his stories, which helps out a lot here. The music score by Lalo Schifrin is a complete and total blast, and very much aids the film's timeless quality, feeling both vintage and new all at once. And everything else, from the set and costume design to the script writing by Ross Lamanna and Jim Kouf works well. The humor is also mostly full of hits, making the film a fast, enjoyable watch.My only slight complaint is that the film never quite escapes from the tropes and clichés of the Buddy Cop genre of film. Which is a slight downfall in an otherwise enjoyable film- we know pretty much everything that is going to happen from the first few minutes, and it does rob some of the suspense. But even that cannot diminish the fun performances and good filmmaking behind this movie.Rush Hour may not be the best film ever made, but it's a blast to watch, and has excellent entertainment value. While its reputation has been somewhat pulled down by two inferior sequels, the first Rush Hour is still a good bit of fun and is well worth checking out. For entertainment value alone, it gets an 8 out of 10.

The successful high school football team is coached by Bill Yoast (Will Patton) who is in line to be inducted into the Hall of Fame. Political changes mean the integration of the school and its football team. Then coach Yoast is replaced by coach Herman Boone (Denzel Washington). In order to keep the peace, Yoast stays to coach defense.It's a fairly standard superficial look at a segregated system being forced together. The best thing in this movie is the duo of Will Patton and Denzel Washington. They do the heaviest lifting acting-wise. They have to act through a minefield especially Denzel.

And rather than thinking that he deserves what's happening to him you feel really bad for him, you actually want him to go back to being his rapist, ultra-violent self.I think the one person you have to give the credit to for making this movie so great is Stanley Kubrick.

Yet, I'm not sure nowadays audience would really be scared. What we find scary changes over time--'Alien' was considered very scary when first released in the late 70s, yet today I doubt it would really scare any adult viewers ('The Thing' is another example). It does not prevent 'Alien' from being widely praised as an excellent, classic film. The same applies to 'Scream'. The opening scene remains one of the most memorable in film history. Cleverly written, witty, well acted and shot, 'Scream' is a masterpiece that reintroduced talent to the then decaying horror movie industry (compare it with series like 'Friday the 13th' for instance).

But remember that, before it was turned into its own cliché, 'Scream' was utterly innovative at the time, playing cleverly with slasher clichés.
