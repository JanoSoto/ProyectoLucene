Noticeable Camera work This movie is great for its dolly shot and its 180º shots, these are only used during the fight scene which makes them special as they are not over used, but apart from that there are few other good shots which they use to good effect as the rest is left up to standard shotsGraphics This movie had the best CGI for that period of time and it's CGI still stands up amazingly in the standards set by today. Incorrect Science The plot revolves around humans being used a batteries, hence why there are massive farms of them. But humans cannot generate chemical, thermal or electrical energy without a food source which provides them without enough energy to do so. In short this means it takes more energy to keep humans alive than a human body produces. So the machines are working a flawed system.

Overall Feel The first opening scene of this movie was done on a $10million budget, once it was shown to the people at Warner, they were then allowed the Wachowski Brothers to have the $80million that they originally asked for.

Three in fact, that at one point or another interconnect. By now we have become familiar with Alejandro Gonzáles Iñarittu's style of inter wining lives and the effect that these connections have, however he hasn't done this better than he did with Amores Perros. This being his film debut one can see that he was meant for big things, as most of his movies have shown by their critical success.So with this film we get a first chapter which involves a young man who seems to be both enjoying his new found way of earning money, while also struggling to cope with his brother's wife's pushing him away. This first part involves some of the more graphic scenes, which may be tough to watch for some viewers, especially if you're dog person like I am. In short this was a good start to the movie that ends with the car accident that links the three parts together. After that we get the aftermath of this tragedy, through the eyes of Valeria, an aspiring model who is confined to a wheelchair, spending most of her time at the newly acquired apartment by her lover, a former family man who left his wife & children. Slowly she starts to lose it, as her dog gets trapped in a whole hole on the house floor and she sees her career fade away. This middle segment of the film sees a more emotional backdrop, as it shows the audience the difficulty some people have coping with problems such as the one the model goes through. Finally we are introduced to an old, bearded man who was always in the background during those other stories and is now the central focus of the film at this time. His story is one of regretful decisions and a bipolar dynamic that follows him, as he shows a nurturing side by taking care of dogs, while also being a near sadistic hit-man. In the end we see him set up a conflict between two brothers and attempts to connect with his estranged daughter.Upon concluding this film, I found myself rationalizing about how this movie is an excellent look into the flaws of humans in comparison to, say the dogs, which are as much a part of the movie as humans, You see, dogs in this movie are nothing more than loyal companions that only serve to accomplish their owner's goals. In the first story, Octavio, the young man, trains his dog to be vicious and fight other dogs to the death. In the second story, although to a much lesser extent, the dog gets trapped because he was playing with her owner, therefore being good company. And in the final story the dogs are obviously a big part of the old man's life. Now by saying this, I don't mean that dogs are perfect, because either by their own instincts or by human influence, they can be savages, as is show by their fights and when the dog in the first story kills all the other dogs owned by the old man. What's I'm trying to say here is that the darker side of a human being is explored here, and in my opinion in great fashion. Amores Perros is a tough movie to watch, yet it's a great way to go deep into the most harsh things about human life, something that we have to fight in order to carry on living, be that as a poor man or a successful person.Rating 8,5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"6 August 2014","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" The title of this wonderfully crafted film allures to dogs and, in fact, dogs do make a sort of assistance to the human stories being told.

To quote Omar Sharif, one of the stars of the film, If you are the man with the money and somebody comes to you and says he wants to make a film that's four hours long, with no stars, and no women, and no love story, and not much action either, and he wants to spend a huge amount of money to go film it in the desert--what would you say? Chances are, most people wouldn't want to watch that kind of movie. And despite that, after my first viewing, there is no doubt about it- Lawrence of Arabia is a piece of cinematic perfection.This 1962 classic, directed by David Lean, tells the true story of T.E. Lawrence, a British military officer who unites Arabian desert tribes during World War I to overthrow the Turkish Empire. What ensues is a piece of film so good, it will take your breath away.This movie works on so many levels, but the most obvious, and greatest, is Peter O'Toole's performance as the title character. He is so complex, so subtle and yet so lively, that you can't take your eyes off the screen. It is his performance that makes this film what it is. If I made a list of the Top 10 Best Performances in Film, (Which would be impossible to rank) O'Toole would undoubtedly be on there, along with Brando in The Godfather, Welles in Citizen Kane, Garland in The Wizard of Oz, and Monroe in Some Like It Hot. Without him, this movie wouldn't be anywhere near as good as it is, and it is hard not to be amazed, or full of fright, at how his character changes throughout the movie.Of course, that is not to say that the rest of the cast is bad, far from it. Alec Guinness as Prince Feisal and Omar Sharif as Sheriff Ali are the standouts of the supporting cast, and Anthonys Quinn and Quayle are just as good.Every single technical aspect of this movie is done to perfection. The cinematography is among the best in any movie, as it brilliantly captures the beauty and size of the desert. I have not had a chance to see this in a theater, but I would gladly see it again on the biggest screen possible. The cut from the match to the sunrise is just amazing, rivaled only by the bone cut in 2001 A Space Odyssey. The battle scenes, although they are not a major part of the movie, are wonderfully put together. The score is fantastic, I could listen to the main theme for hours. And, even with a running time of almost 4 hours, every scene feels essential, even if it isn't directly important to the plot. My only complaint is that it occasionally feels slow, but the other moments are so amazing that it hardly matters.Often I will not agree with the Academy Awards, but this is one rare instance where I feel that they actually got it right. (Although that may be just that it was so good that they knew people would kill them if it didn't win) It deserved every single award it got, (And the ones it didn't, why didn't Peter O'Toole get Best Actor? Why?) and Lawrence of Arabia may even be my pick for #2 Best Film of All Time. (The Godfather is #1.) So, of course, it gets 10\/10. I cannot fiddle but I can make a great state of a small city. -Lawrence.

This is made even stranger, considering how absurdly normal the first 10ish minutes are. But that's as long as things remain familiar. After that, the film is turned on its head, and never looks back. It's a wacky, crazy ride, but it's absolutely worth taking.A young couple - Barbara and Adam - are quietly enjoying their vacation in a house in the country, when they suddenly perish in an unfortunate car accident. And yet, they return home, possibly unharmed. That is, until they find a book they don't recall owning Handbook for the Recently Deceased. It is at that moment when they discover that they are both dead. To make matters worse, an obnoxious family moves into the house, and Barbara and Adam want them gone. So in order to make them leave, they realize they must scare the family away. When their efforts prove fruitless, they turn to the nutty and unpredictable bio- exorcist known as Betelgeuse. Beetlejuice is as inventive and unique as a film is likely to get. The concept is interesting, and while the execution leaves a bit to be desired, it does provide an effective balance of comedy and horror. The writing isn't always terribly strong - with plot points and dilemmas that seem to be made up on the spot in order for the film to keep moving - but the film gets by on the wacky atmosphere and creative visuals.The title character, Betelgeuse, actually gets surprisingly little screen time. He is present for about 30 minutes of the 92 minute run- time, which is unexpected. However, the Betelgeuse character is wildly energetic, and some will find the character to be unbearable. The 30 minutes of time the character is allotted is just enough for him to have a significant presence in the film without becoming an nuisance. He remains an enjoyable aspect of the film, thanks to his limited screen time.The cast of actors are all a delight to watch. Michael Keaton often gets singled out as the highlight, but I think Catherine O'Hara, Jeffery Jones, Glenn Shadix and Sylvia Sidney are just as enjoyable. Alec Baldwin, Geena Davis and Winona Ryder get the thankless job of portraying the normal characters (or at least what passes for normal in this film).Danny Elfman's score is very much like the film wild, zany, and very enjoyable. While it may be too high energy for some, few would deny its effectiveness and enthusiasm.Beetlejuice is a wild romp that's highly imaginative and wickedly entertaining. While some will certainly hate this film, the right crowd will find the whole affair to be deliciously nutty. There's a slew of memorable scenes (the dinner scene in particular is properly laugh-out- loud funny), and trippy environment that the film creates is worth experiencing. Beetlejuice isn't for everyone, but whether you love it or hate it, one thing's for sure You'll never see anything like it.

The 30 minutes of time the character is allotted is just enough for him to have a significant presence in the film without becoming an nuisance. He remains an enjoyable aspect of the film, thanks to his limited screen time.The cast of actors are all a delight to watch. Michael Keaton often gets singled out as the highlight, but I think Catherine O'Hara, Jeffery Jones, Glenn Shadix and Sylvia Sidney are just as enjoyable. Alec Baldwin, Geena Davis and Winona Ryder get the thankless job of portraying the normal characters (or at least what passes for normal in this film).Danny Elfman's score is very much like the film wild, zany, and very enjoyable. While it may be too high energy for some, few would deny its effectiveness and enthusiasm.Beetlejuice is a wild romp that's highly imaginative and wickedly entertaining. While some will certainly hate this film, the right crowd will find the whole affair to be deliciously nutty. There's a slew of memorable scenes (the dinner scene in particular is properly laugh-out- loud funny), and trippy environment that the film creates is worth experiencing. Beetlejuice isn't for everyone, but whether you love it or hate it, one thing's for sure You'll never see anything like it.

She has never topped her triumph with her Oscar-Winning performance, and even if some detractors say that either Diana Ross or Cicely Tyson should have won that year, she still retains the power of presence, even if the character of Sally Bowles is supposed to be of just so-so talent. Forget the fact that Minnelli is as American as they come, her talents are just too large to indicate that she could be lost in the world of a tacky Berlin nightclub. Like the same era's Josephine Baker, I think Liza's Sally would be more than welcome on the Paris stages of the Moulin Rouge or the Folies Bergere.Then, there is the fact that the film altered much of its story from the musical, being closer to the original play. Those who have seen the original musical (or its recent revisal, back on Broadway once again) can see the power of the fear factor involving the Nazi's coming rise to power as the old world falls to pieces, lives crumble around them, and yet, Sally goes on singing about When I go, I'm going like Elsie!. Gone are the stage subplots of the Jewish grocery store owner who courts a non-Jewish German landlady and the neighbors whose sympathies lie with the Nazis as their powers rise and aren't afraid of exposing their feelings of hatred to the world around them. In its place is an almost bi-sexual subplot involving the American version of Sally and the very British version of Cliff (Michael York) and the menage-a-tois that seems to open up with one of their acquaintances.Certainly, nobody other than Bob Fosse was better selected than to direct this movie, although he was busy with Sweet Charity in 1966, leaving Cabaret to Ron Field on Broadway. The dance moves that made Charity so ahead of its time (especially those involving hats) are very prevalent here, and Fosse instills a delightful sense of trashiness into each and every musical number he creates. Joel Grey sensibly repeats his role as the slimy looking emcee, adding an Oscar to his Tony for the same part, and making us wonder what befalls this strange creature as the curtain falls on his finale Au Wiedersein. Minnelli is genuinely sexy here, especially with Mein Heir, and her vulnerability is obvious with Maybe This Time, not heard in the original, but added to subsequent revisals. When she gets together with Grey for the newly written Money Make the World Go Round, it is as if Judy Garland and Gene Kelly have come back to life in For Me and My Gal, only with a less angelic setting and darker intentions. She rocks the title song off the screen, and it is easy to see why she continues to sing songs from this show more than 40 years after the movie exploded her into the front line of legendary performers. Two disturbing moments that haunt me to this day are Grey's If You Could See Her Through My Eyes (re-installing the lyrics of She Wouldn't Look Jewish at all!) and the frightening Nazi anthem, Tomorrow Belongs to Me, where an angelic faced blonde soldier boy increasingly gets angrier and angrier as the older generation looks on in shock as the world around him falls to crap.
