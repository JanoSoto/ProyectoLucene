If anything, he considers women to be equal to men and they often have equal screen time, if not MORE. Dr. T was also written by a woman as was several of his best films (Nashville, Thieves Like Us, Cookie's Fortune)Another complaint is about the plot. Note that one characteristic of Altman's films are not the plots, but the rich and vibrant characters that inhabit them. His films are about people and what make them tick. I personally would rather watch a good film with some interesting characters doing their business than see promising characters die under the weight of the plot.Richard Gere gives one of his all time best performances. Has it been this long since he's been so good in a film? I've always thought he was a good actor, but his more recent films such as Runaway Bride had made me question myself. It is good to see him back on top.Another complaint about this film is the ***SPOILER*** lesbian storyline between Dr. T's daughter and her bridesmaid. But let me point out that an amateur would wallow in the sexual angle of this story. A witty director like Altman just observes that it happens and lets it stay at that. He doesn't dwell in the seamy, he dwells in everyday life.Dr. T and the Women is Robert Altman's best film in many years. It gives us everything we expect from the most original director of the 20th Century. It's great to know that he is carrying on into the new century.

The plot switches around a lot but the movie is still very enjoyable and everything comes together well at the end.  Paul and Hannah (Sean Connary and Gena Rowlands) are an old, married couple.  Hannah starts talking about the fact that that Paul cheated on her about 25 years ago with a woman named Wendy.  They are very believable and I love seeing Sean romance someone his own age.Roger and Gracie (IMO the worst story here) are two people that hook up every so often in hotel rooms.  They have the most thankless roles, but I hate Madeline Stowe anyway and I have never heard of Anthony Edwards.  They do, however play these roles well.Meredith and Trent are the funniest couples to watch.  They are played wonderfully by Gillian Anderson and Jon Stewart.  It's amazing to see Jon go from 'The Daily Show' to this romantic\/comical\/dramatic role.  He makes the transition very well.

What ensues is an enthralling little thriller acted out by a first-class cast - except perhaps for Robert Young whose acting is mannered and stilted.  Where the film falls down is its depiction of the Jewish victim as a saintly type existing in a world of devilish goyim. It even comes to pass that the man is a war hero, just in case his Jewishness and empathetic personality are not enough to win the sympathy of mainly gentile audiences. Let bigotry and prejudice stand alone, don't diminish their enormity by dressing up a plot to elicit the kind of reaction you are looking for. Perhaps the film-makers are really saying you are a bigoted lot out there and we need to hit you over the head with a baseball bat to make you realise it. But, of course, it was made in 1947. Also, it seems a tad indulgent for Hollywood to single itself out for allegorical treatment when perhaps a more direct approach would have been more potent.

Full of contrivances and cliches, ridden with all the typical plot elements of any kind of ensemble romance piece, this film on the outset seems like nothing new. But there's just something about it I couldn't let go of-maybe it was the beautiful Rio de Janeiro backdrop that this film is set against. Maybe it's the opportunity to see Amy Irving once again in all her glory. I don't know which, but the lady should definitely be in more movies, especially in ones where her husband directs her and therefore gives her the best role and makes her the most sympathetic in the film. Irving stars as Mary Ann Simpson, an English teacher in Rio who teaches classes by night and private students by day. Across the hall from her classes is the shop of an elderly tailor, whose lawyer son Pedro Paulo (Antônio Fagundes) is helping his father get out of an alimony fix that involves a much younger wife. One night Pedro Paulo runs into our heroine on the elevator, and love at first sight is born. Right away he forgets about Tania, the ex-wife (Débora Bloch) he was having trouble letting go of, and goes after this mysterious new woman in his life. Along the sidelines there are plots that involve Irving's student Nadine (Drica Moraes) and her online romance with a SoHo artist `Gary', and another regarding the lawyer's intern Sharon (Giovana Antonelli) and her romance with both her boss' brother Roberto and the famous soccer player Acacio (Alexandre Borges), who also happens to be taking private English lessons from Mary Ann. All these lines cross and meet and even out in perfect form, and yet somehow at its most typical the film manages to be at its most enjoyable, possibly because Barreto has such a good time entertaining his audience that one can't help but dive right in. Worth a good look.  ","genre":null},{"date":"28 March 2001","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":"  Warning All cynics should avoid this movie like the plague!!! Full of contrivances and cliches, ridden with all the typical plot elements of any kind of ensemble romance piece, this film on the outset seems like nothing new. But there's just something about it I couldn't let go of-maybe it was the beautiful Rio de Janeiro backdrop that this film is set against. Maybe it's the opportunity to see Amy Irving once again in all her glory. I don't know which, but the lady should definitely be in more movies, especially in ones where her husband directs her and therefore gives her the best role and makes her the most sympathetic in the film. Irving stars as Mary Ann Simpson, an English teacher in Rio who teaches classes by night and private students by day. Across the hall from her classes is the shop of an elderly tailor, whose lawyer son Pedro Paulo (Antônio Fagundes) is helping his father get out of an alimony fix that involves a much younger wife. One night Pedro Paulo runs into our heroine on the elevator, and love at first sight is born. Right away he forgets about Tania, the ex-wife (Débora Bloch) he was having trouble letting go of, and goes after this mysterious new woman in his life. Along the sidelines there are plots that involve Irving's student Nadine (Drica Moraes) and her online romance with a SoHo artist `Gary', and another regarding the lawyer's intern Sharon (Giovana Antonelli) and her romance with both her boss' brother Roberto and the famous soccer player Acacio (Alexandre Borges), who also happens to be taking private English lessons from Mary Ann. All these lines cross and meet and even out in perfect form, and yet somehow at its most typical the film manages to be at its most enjoyable, possibly because Barreto has such a good time entertaining his audience that one can't help but dive right in. Worth a good look.

If you take these movies, as many will, seriously, and let the Australian mind-set of cultural cringe ruin your viewing experience, you're selling yourself short.

This, contrary to popular belief, is a great place for Mick, the original straight shooter and honest bloke.  Oh, and he takes his kid.

For the guys in the audience, it's also less, shall we say, `rewarding' than preview advertisements might promise. Piper Perabo hardly carries the film in the lead role of a young girl who moves from her tiny New Jersey town to the Big Apple in search of her dream of becoming a pop songwriter. The plot device of her songwriting dreams allows the filmmakers to let LeeAnn Rimes dub Perabo's voice (badly) to the tune of Diane Warren's (sometimes good) songs, and then actually bring Rimes into the film in the last five minutes (our girl made it! She's now writing for the girl she mysteriously sounds exactly like!). Perabo's deliciously pretty with a great smile, but her acting is wobbly and kills a lot of credibility for the film. Supporting cast, particularly Maria Pitillo, do much for the film, but in the end the word `Inane' kept rattling through my head.
