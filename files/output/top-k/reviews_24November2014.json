Reflections and symbols are used brilliantly. The lighting is hauntingly atmospheric. Visually, the film is a total masterclass. The film's decision not to have a clear protagonist and to observe the action from an objective viewpoint may seem detached to some, but ultimately it makes the film feel more real and if even possible even more disturbing than it already is.Peter Lorre seems to be known for comedic roles prior to M, but you would never have guessed. He creates a chilling villain but ingeniously creates a bizarre sympathy for the murderer, and the film has some very sharp social commentary. The script is extremely well written and the story is handled and told very well to maximise impact. M is a very tense and frightening film and will give you goose-bumps. Maybe the best German film of all time, it's unlikely this will ever be topped by other murder mystery films. This one is a must for fans of world cinema. Also recommended is Fritz Lang's Metropolis, which is a bit too long but still extraordinary and influential. In general, M is for masterpiece and it's one of the best movies I watched all year. It's not the easiest watch, but it is well worth the effort.

This film could be recommended to almost any type of person. I can definitely see quite a number of people hating this film based on the subject matter alone but to most people with the right outlook this film can be very easily enjoyable. This movie is very fast paced, funny, powerful, and hooks you from first to last frame.

But even without the quick witted clever dialogue the film visually is still quite enjoyable. The depiction of heroin addiction is great and can be surprisingly terrifying.For film fans this is a definite must see and is a must see for many people. However some people may not like the subject matter making this film an immediate ignore, the subject matter is very clear which is heroin. It isn't glorified really and gives a decent enough message on why not to use it. But back on track the film as I stated is a must see and I'll close with that. Thanks for reading my review.

You'd think that after nearly 3 dozen movies, Bud and Lou would by now have lost or would have been beginning to lose their comedic touch, but this movie disproves that. Abbott And Costello Meet The Mummy was an effective sendoff for Bud And Lou (although they would make one more movie after this one) from Universal. This movie was also the last of their Meet The Monsters series, and out of all of those, this one is one of my favorites, although I do think that Meet The Invisible Man was my favorite one overall. And of course, Bud and Lou provide us with some laughs throughout the movie, which proved that even in their later years, they were still capable of making people laugh. So if you are a fan of Abbott And Costello, then you will definitely get your enjoyment out of this one.Are there some funny scenes? Oh yes there are. There is a really funny bit where Abbott And Costello are eating hamburgers, and while Abbott's is just fine, Costello's is all crunchy. The reason? Costello's eating the medallion. There's also a very funny gag in the movie which involves Costello playing a flute and frequently getting scared at the sight of a snake. I was really surprised at how Bud and Lou still managed to be funny after 35 movies and around 15 years in the business. Abbott and Costello were two people who once they got their humor, they never lost it. In the movie, they manage to bring out many laughs, and unlike some of their earlier films, it's all comedy (not that that was a problem in their earlier classics). 1955 was a good year for Bud and Lou, as they made this movie, along with Meet The Keystone Kops (which was also funny).All in all, while this movie isn't as hilarious as Buck Privates, Buck Privates Come Home, or Hold That Ghost, it is still very funny, and I can say that it's one of their best of their later films, and one of my favorites of their Meet The Monsters series. It was a nice way for Abbott And Costello to say farewell to Universal Studios, the studio that they had been signed with since their first movie back in 1940. After this, they would make one more movie, Dance With Me, Henry, before they broke up. Costello suddenly died in 1959, and Abbott survived him by 15 years, dying in 1974.

Consider what was true after its release in 1941 and was not true before(1) The movie defined Humphrey Bogart's performances for the rest of his life; his hard-boiled Sam Spade rescued him from a decade of middling roles in B gangster movies and positioned him for Casablanca, Treasure of the Sierra Madre, The African Queen and his other classics. (2) It was the first film directed by John Huston, who for more than 40 years would be a prolific maker of movies that were muscular, stylish and daring. (3) It contained the first screen appearance of Sydney Greenstreet, who went on, in Casablanca and many other films, to become one of the most striking character actors in movie history. (4) It was the first pairing of Greenstreet and Peter Lorre, and so well did they work together that they made nine other movies, including Casablanca in 1942 and The Mask of Dimitrios (1944), in which they were not supporting actors but actually the stars. (5) And some film histories consider The Maltese Falcon the first film noir.The moment that sticks out for me comes near the end, when Brigid O'Shaughnessy (Mary Astor) has been collared for murdering Spade's partner. She says she loves Spade. She asks if Sam loves her. She pleads for him to spare her from the law. And he replies, in a speech some people can quote by heart, I hope they don't hang you, precious, by that sweet neck. . . . The chances are you'll get off with life. That means if you're a good girl, you'll be out in 20 years. I'll be waiting for you. If they hang you, I'll always remember you.Spade is cold and hard, like his name. When he gets the news that his partner has been murdered, he doesn't blink an eye. Didn't like the guy. Kisses his widow the moment they're alone together. Beats up Joel Cairo (Lorre), loses patience with Greenstreet, throws his cigar into the fire, smashes his glass, barks out a threat, slams the door and then grins to himself in the hallway, amused by his own act.If he didn't like his partner, Spade nevertheless observes a sort of code involving his death. When a man's partner is killed, he tells Brigid, he's supposed to do something about it. He doesn't like the cops, either; the only person he really seems to like is his secretary, Effie (Lee Patrick), who sits on his desk, lights his cigarettes, knows his sins and accepts them. How does Bogart make a character get away with making such a dark guy the hero of a film? Because he does his job according to the rules he lives by, and because we sense (as we always would with Bogart after this role) that the toughness conceals old wounds and broken dreams.The plot is the last thing you think of about. The Maltese Falcon is a black bird (said to be made of gold and encrusted with jewels) has been stolen, men have been killed for it, and now Gutman (Greenstreet) has arrived with his lackeys (Lorre and Elisha Cook Jr.) to get it back. Spade gets involved because the Mary Astor character hires him to--but the plot goes around and around, and eventually we realize that the black bird is an example of Hitchcock's MacGuffin--it doesn't matter what it is, so long as everyone in the story wants or fears it.To describe the plot in a linear and logical fashion is almost impossible. That doesn't matter. The movie is essentially a series of conversations punctuated by brief, violent interludes. It's all style. It isn't violence or chases, but the way the actors look, move, speak and embody their characters. Under the style is attitude Hard men, in a hard season, in a society emerging from Depression and heading for war, are motivated by greed and capable of murder. For an hourly fee, Sam Spade will negotiate this terrain. Everything there is to know about Sam Spade is contained in the scene where Bridget asks for his help and he criticizes her performance You're good. It's chiefly your eyes, I think--and that throb you get in your voice when you say things like, 'be generous, Mr. Spade.'

The Maltese Falcon is a black bird (said to be made of gold and encrusted with jewels) has been stolen, men have been killed for it, and now Gutman (Greenstreet) has arrived with his lackeys (Lorre and Elisha Cook Jr.) to get it back. Spade gets involved because the Mary Astor character hires him to--but the plot goes around and around, and eventually we realize that the black bird is an example of Hitchcock's MacGuffin--it doesn't matter what it is, so long as everyone in the story wants or fears it.To describe the plot in a linear and logical fashion is almost impossible. That doesn't matter. The movie is essentially a series of conversations punctuated by brief, violent interludes. It's all style. It isn't violence or chases, but the way the actors look, move, speak and embody their characters.

Consider what was true after its release in 1941 and was not true before(1) The movie defined Humphrey Bogart's performances for the rest of his life; his hard-boiled Sam Spade rescued him from a decade of middling roles in B gangster movies and positioned him for Casablanca, Treasure of the Sierra Madre, The African Queen and his other classics. (2) It was the first film directed by John Huston, who for more than 40 years would be a prolific maker of movies that were muscular, stylish and daring. (3) It contained the first screen appearance of Sydney Greenstreet, who went on, in Casablanca and many other films, to become one of the most striking character actors in movie history. (4) It was the first pairing of Greenstreet and Peter Lorre, and so well did they work together that they made nine other movies, including Casablanca in 1942 and The Mask of Dimitrios (1944), in which they were not supporting actors but actually the stars. (5) And some film histories consider The Maltese Falcon the first film noir.The moment that sticks out for me comes near the end, when Brigid O'Shaughnessy (Mary Astor) has been collared for murdering Spade's partner. She says she loves Spade. She asks if Sam loves her. She pleads for him to spare her from the law. And he replies, in a speech some people can quote by heart, I hope they don't hang you, precious, by that sweet neck. . . . The chances are you'll get off with life.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery"},{"date":"24 November 2014","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" This is a pretty good movie, with two first rate actors (Brando and Clift), and if it hadn't been based on a first rate book by best-selling author Irwin Shaw, I'd have rated it a bit higher. I realize that a movie is not a book, but when a book has high merit and a distinctive character, and is then bowdlerized in typical Hollywood fashion, the resulting film cannot just be judged on its own merits.Shaw's book is considered one of the great WW2 novels (though many elite critics have characteristically dissed him because his books were popular), but it's more accurate to think of it as a book about anti-Semitism set in the context of America's war with Germany, than as simply a war novel. At the same time, The Young Lions is a long book, indeed, an epic, rich in both incident and observed detail, with many well realized episodes of combat and wartime crime, barbarity, and horror. It's a story of three young men of disparate backgrounds (ironically dubbed young lions), two Americans and one German, drawn together by fate, much like the characters in War and Peace, which this book resembles in many ways, though it has more focused themes.All three of these men are in their own way exceptional, and they rather epitomize than typify certain elements of the cultures they represent.The German, Christian Diestl, is meant, both in the book and the movie, to represent the mythic good German. Diestl is good looking, attractive to women, and athletic (an expert skier and part time ski instructor), and he is reasonably well-mannered, well-educated, and cultured in the Germanic mode, though he is no intellectual. Diestl is also, however, somewhat naively politically active, and is in fact (in the book but not the movie) an avowed Nazi, but only after several years as a communist, and given Hitler's persecution of the communists in the 1930's there's more than a suggestion that Diestl has switched allegiances to survive.The American, Noah Ackerman (played by Montgomery Clift), is the typical, largely assimilated, second generation American Jew&#x97;not overtly religious, but introverted, intellectual, and subtly alien. In the book, he is called out to California to attend his dying father, a reprehensible man and a caricature of a refugee Eastern European Jew, for whom Noah feels only revulsion.

For starters, Whitacre's half-hearted show business infatuation with communism, and Diestl's overt Naziism, and earlier communist background have been scrubbed from the movie by its Hollywood creators, who were at the time living through the HUAC and McCarthy era. Also, the overt American anti-Semitism that Noah encounters, the loathsome caricature of his dying Jewish father, etc. have all been meticulously expunged or retouched. I don't remember a single word or phrase suggestive of American anti-Semitism being uttered beyond the one time identification of Noah as a Jew.But the evisceration of one of the book's major themes, pervasive anti-Semitism, isn't the only unforgivable distortion. Shaw's novel has also been largely gutted of its character development. In the book, we have three young men of different backgrounds being sucked into a common war between their countries and cultures, but each is primarily fighting his own personal war Noah, provoked by discrimination he encounters in the army, is intent on proving that he is a better man and soldier than those of his fellows who despise him as a Jew; Michael, to become a man in the larger senses of the word; and Diestl to measure up to his commanding officer, Lieutenant Hardenburg, a German superman.In the movie, Michael's only issue is to prove that he's not a coward; Noah that he's a regular American guy, despite his somewhat exotic and intellectual bent; and Diestl that he's still a decent person despite the horrors he has experienced as a dutiful German soldier. At the end of the movie, Diestl is ground down by war, but morally he has hardly evolved at all, yet in the book he slowly degenerates into a monster.The book is far darker and disturbing, but also more absorbing and rewarding, than the movie, as one becomes invested in each of these characters, their personal crises, and their ultimate fates, and for those who have a taste for old-fashioned adult fiction on the grand scale, my recommendation is to read the book and skip the movie.

I realize that a movie is not a book, but when a book has high merit and a distinctive character, and is then bowdlerized in typical Hollywood fashion, the resulting film cannot just be judged on its own merits.Shaw's book is considered one of the great WW2 novels (though many elite critics have characteristically dissed him because his books were popular), but it's more accurate to think of it as a book about anti-Semitism set in the context of America's war with Germany, than as simply a war novel. At the same time, The Young Lions is a long book, indeed, an epic, rich in both incident and observed detail, with many well realized episodes of combat and wartime crime, barbarity, and horror. It's a story of three young men of disparate backgrounds (ironically dubbed young lions), two Americans and one German, drawn together by fate, much like the characters in War and Peace, which this book resembles in many ways, though it has more focused themes.All three of these men are in their own way exceptional, and they rather epitomize than typify certain elements of the cultures they represent.The German, Christian Diestl, is meant, both in the book and the movie, to represent the mythic good German. Diestl is good looking, attractive to women, and athletic (an expert skier and part time ski instructor), and he is reasonably well-mannered, well-educated, and cultured in the Germanic mode, though he is no intellectual. Diestl is also, however, somewhat naively politically active, and is in fact (in the book but not the movie) an avowed Nazi, but only after several years as a communist, and given Hitler's persecution of the communists in the 1930's there's more than a suggestion that Diestl has switched allegiances to survive.The American, Noah Ackerman (played by Montgomery Clift), is the typical, largely assimilated, second generation American Jew&#x97;not overtly religious, but introverted, intellectual, and subtly alien.

She carries a bottle of sulfuric acid around with her to throw in the eyes of men who lie to her.Stop right there. There is no need to go any further. You now know everything there is to know about Catherine. She is psycho! Long after I have forgotten the rest of what happens in this movie, long after I have forgotten who starred in it, and long after I have forgotten the very title of this movie, I will remember that. And yet, strangely enough, it appears to be the one thing that everyone else has forgotten. I have searched through the reviews of professional critics, and I have searched through the reviews published here, but this all-important fact about Catherine hardly ever gets mentioned. The question is, Why do so many people who watch this movie seem to think that this business with the acid is too unimportant to mention?Had I been Jim, as soon as I found out about that bottle of acid, I would have walked right out the door and never had anything to do with her again. In fact, for the next six months, I would have been peeking out of my apartment window to see if she was lurking about with that bottle of hers, just in case she was holding a grudge for my refusing to have anything to do with her again. Instead, Jim simply talks her into getting rid of it, figuring that will make everything all right. But that is like thinking that if you take the butcher knife away from Norman Bates in Psycho, there is nothing to worry about anymore. Speaking of Psycho, the premise of a man-hating woman who carries around a bottle of sulfuric acid to splash into the eyes of any man who lies to her could be the basis of a pretty good horror movie, and maybe even become a cult film like Ms. 45, but that is not what we have here. In any event, with regret, saying, I was really counting on using this bottle, Catherine pours the acid into the sink. She does not bother to turn on the water so that the acid will be flushed out of the system, so we see the vapors rising as the acid eats into the sink as she and Jim walk out the door.As I was saying, Jim is not worried, and Jules even marries her. In all fairness to Jules, he may not have known anything about that bottle of acid, because Jim seemed so unconcerned that he may not have bothered to tell him about it. Catherine cuckolds Jules again and again, but fortunately for her, he is a doormat, and not the kind of guy who would throw sulfuric acid in a woman's eyes for cheating on him. Since she is having sex with other men, she naturally stops having sex with Jules, but the only thing he worries about is that she might leave him. In fact, he is so afraid of losing Catherine that he encourages Jim to have sex with her on condition that Jim will let Jules see her once in a while. Better than that, Jim moves right into their home and starts sleeping with her, so now Jules can see her all the time.Catherine wants to leave Jules and marry Jim, but Jim gets fed up with her nonsense and refuses to marry her, so she pulls out a pistol and tries to shoot him. He manages to get away, but he still has not learned his lesson, which is to stay away from that nutcase, because when Catherine and Jules run into Jim some time later, all has been forgotten, and they are all best friends again. Catherine talks Jim into getting in a car with her, and then she purposely drives off a bridge and kills them both. Poor Jules, he probably feels all left out.To return to my question as to why so many people seem to discount the bottle of acid, I think that it has something to do with the mindset of people who know they are watching a foreign film. In a Hollywood movie, something like that could never be ignored, and the audience would be horrified. But when it comes to watching a foreign film, people tend to think of everything as being symbolic, or as having some kind of deep, philosophical meaning, and so things like that are not really taken as having literal significance.

These artists were the core of Disney's animation studio for many years, turning out what are now revered as the classics from Disney. What sets Pinocchio apart from every other Disney feature is the sheer depth of care those nine old men (and their assistants) put on the screen. No other Disney feature looks this tremendous, only Snow White comes close. Every, and I mean every, background painting is superb. The medium used for the backgrounds was a water-based paint called gouache. No other animated film looks like this. To think that the entire film was done by hand is amazing, the spectacle of Pleasure Island and the last underwater segment are brilliant compositions by illustrative geniuses. As the darkest fable Disney would bring to the screen, each of the nine old men brought their A game to their characters. Bill Tytla, the studio's villain master (he was responsible for the unforgettable Chernobog in Fantasia's Night on Bald Mountain sequence) brings Stromboli to energetic life here. Watch carefully for the table sequence in which Stromboli is eating. He has swallowed part of an onion before berating Pinocchio and shaking the puppet. His breath brings tears to Pinocchio's eyes...this goes by very quickly, but shows the attention to detail crafted in every frame of this terrific film.Many reviews here seem to dwell on the voice acting and the use of nobodies to speak the lines. One review casually suggests that the actors were simply picked off the street. Nothing could be further from the truth. Even though the actors are uncredited here, the roster of talent was very top-notch for 1940. Comedian Walter Catlett voices the Fox, Catlett was extremely popular at the time and known for his signature round spectacles. The Fox wears these same specs for a brief moment, a nod given to Catlett by the artists. Frankie Darrow was a well known juvenile actor, most famous for his leading role in 1933's Wild Boys of the Road. He voices Lampwick, which is a thinly veiled caricature of the real actor. Dickie Jones, the voice of Pinocchio was another child star who kept a remarkable career alive for many decades. Mel Blanc, the man of 1000 voices lends his talent to the hiccups of Giddy the Cat, Evelyn Venable is the warm and lovely voice of the Blue Fairy, Clarence Nash, the voice of Donald Duck for years, supplies both Figaro and the donkey brays by the doomed boys of Pleasure Island. Last but not least is Cliff Ukelele Ike Edwards, the voice of Jiminy Cricket. Edwards will always be known as the man who sang When You Wish Upon a Star so brilliantly. He owns that song as surely as Judy Garland owns Over the Rainbow. No real voice talent in Pinocchio? Not true. These actors were as famous in their day as the current crop of voices used for animated features. Their work brings the heart to the skill of the animator's art.Still a thrilling experience for fans of the nine old men. In this day of computer technology, it's worth remembering that a computer can't bring the same humanity and love delivered by these great artists.

Watch carefully for the table sequence in which Stromboli is eating. He has swallowed part of an onion before berating Pinocchio and shaking the puppet. His breath brings tears to Pinocchio's eyes...this goes by very quickly, but shows the attention to detail crafted in every frame of this terrific film.Many reviews here seem to dwell on the voice acting and the use of nobodies to speak the lines. One review casually suggests that the actors were simply picked off the street. Nothing could be further from the truth. Even though the actors are uncredited here, the roster of talent was very top-notch for 1940. Comedian Walter Catlett voices the Fox, Catlett was extremely popular at the time and known for his signature round spectacles. The Fox wears these same specs for a brief moment, a nod given to Catlett by the artists. Frankie Darrow was a well known juvenile actor, most famous for his leading role in 1933's Wild Boys of the Road. He voices Lampwick, which is a thinly veiled caricature of the real actor. Dickie Jones, the voice of Pinocchio was another child star who kept a remarkable career alive for many decades. Mel Blanc, the man of 1000 voices lends his talent to the hiccups of Giddy the Cat, Evelyn Venable is the warm and lovely voice of the Blue Fairy, Clarence Nash, the voice of Donald Duck for years, supplies both Figaro and the donkey brays by the doomed boys of Pleasure Island. Last but not least is Cliff Ukelele Ike Edwards, the voice of Jiminy Cricket. Edwards will always be known as the man who sang When You Wish Upon a Star so brilliantly. He owns that song as surely as Judy Garland owns Over the Rainbow. No real voice talent in Pinocchio? Not true. These actors were as famous in their day as the current crop of voices used for animated features. Their work brings the heart to the skill of the animator's art.Still a thrilling experience for fans of the nine old men. In this day of computer technology, it's worth remembering that a computer can't bring the same humanity and love delivered by these great artists.

In the opening scene we see Kane, an old man in bed saying his final words, then we're brought to the past, a childhood memory of Kane with his Rosebud. Flashbacks was one of the most important tools in this film. Throughout the film we're brought from one point in time to another, each scene holding some type of significance. The way in which the cinematography carried out each scene was incredible. This film was sad in a way. We're giving this character (round character), a man who wants to be successful and a man who wants to be loved by everyone. He doesn't realize that he doesn't need love from many to be happy because he already had it from is second wife...or is it his third? I'm not certain but in the end its terrible, he suffers.

Otherwise, he's trolling for the next woman to seduce. Though intelligent and gifted, he naively hopes that things will stay simple. They never do, so soon he's off again. No matter how many beers he downs, he never can escape himself.Bob Rafelson, who directed this fascinating film, has been quoted as saying Bobby (Jack Nicholson) is a guy who is out of touch with his emotions. This leaves Bobby squirmingly uncomfortable in life -- a rolling stone unable to gather any ally at any time. The final few frames of this film summarize this truth devastatingly. Turning in as strong a performance as Nicholson is Karen Black as the insecure Rayette. She's uneducated but smarter than Bobby in terms of what really counts in life -- love, and being able to stick things out through the rough spots. Bobby mistreats Rayette, withholding the gentle little things she craves (I love you). In the end, maybe Bobby saves her from herself.Bobby's not entirely dense. I move around a lot, he tells his stroke-muted father. Not because I'm looking for anything, really, but to get away from things that go bad if I stay.He's learning, I guess. But will he learn enough in time?

Hendrix, Joplin and Morrison were pretty much household names among music fans of the era, and their passing shocked and confused everyone. They were all twenty seven years old which conjured up a sort of bad luck omen for other musicians on the way up. This all happened over forty years ago and it seems like just yesterday.I don't think I've ever seen an actor channel another person's identity the way Val Kilmer did here. Not only in the uncanny resemblance to Jim Morrison, but the way he captured Morrison's voice and sound was simply amazing. Recalling those days back in the Seventies, I can't say that I was that much of a Doors fan though I did enjoy their music well enough. You knew there was something definitely 'out there' with the lyrics to many of Morrison's songs. What I didn't know at the time was how much he indulged in alcohol and mind altering drugs to the point of incoherency on a regular basis.You never know watching films like this how much license was taken with the characters and events as shown on screen. Oliver Stone adds another whole dimension to that. For what it's worth, the picture seems to do a fairly credible job, at least chronologically, of the band's rise to fame and Morrison's role as front man. It's just a shame that hugely talented artists like Morrison and his contemporaries couldn't refrain from their self destructive tendencies. They'd still be performing for audiences today if not for lack of self control.
