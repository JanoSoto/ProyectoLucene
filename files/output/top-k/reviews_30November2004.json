The stop motion effects by the late great David Allen are very well done. PUPPET MASTER also gives hot blooded horror fans what they want, namely a few nice bloody kills, creepy puppet POV shots, suspense, tension, atmosphere & nudity & many creepy moments, such as a headless puppet looking for it's head, crawling out of a coffin & another effective scene where it is tossed down the stairs by it's intended victim, who escapes in an elevator, only to find it waiting for her on the floor she has selected to land on. The puppets themselves are a creepy bunch. RICHARD BANDS Carnivaleque horror movie theme, gives the film a really creepy edge to it. Another thing I liked about PUPPET MASTER besides director David Schmoeller's excellent direction, is it's fresh story, rather than a simple recycled CHILD'S PLAY'S plot & that's why I think in large part, the film has continued to thrive as long as it has. The puppets themselves are also presented in a different light. Unlike a lot of killer dolls, these puppets are not evil, but only do the will of the maker who has given them life, be he\/she good or evil. Director Schmoeller also cleverly plays on a few mind twists, you're not really sure if some of the scenes in the film are real, or a dream at times. Unlike the latter sequels, PUPPET MASTER is a pure horror film, it's a mercilessly effective horror item that works on it's own intended level, it's a very scary horror film, unlike the latter sequels & to be truthful that's all that really matters in the long run. The puppets really don't serve the plot much at all, but their presence is certainly felt throughout the films running time. Their merely a window dressing for the films actual plot, which in itself is a very interesting. Using the puppets sparingly allows the film-makers to create a sense of dread throughout the films running time.The characters on the other hand are a rather bland bunch.

Heck even the puppets are revealed to have a sleazy side to them, as they peek through a key hole, as a couple has sex!. The pacing also tends to drag on in a lot of area's. The back story on Toulon is also disappointing, we never do learn how he came upon the secrets of eternal life, nor why the Nazi's wanted with him (this would be later answered in th sequels) & another problem I had was with Gallagher's explanation for dispatching the puppets, to murder his friends & why he killed himself, which is to live forever, but when he finally does get killed, he dies just like a normal human being would if being murdered, he feels pain & bleeds (though a green liquid instead of blood) so how would this serum make him immortal if he can be killed like a normal human being?

One IMDb reviewer placed a post on the page for Everest (2005) in which he attacked Jon Krakauer, author of the spectacular novel Into Thin Air, not only of selfishly misrepresenting the actions of people on the mountain, but also of sleeping away in his tent while people were stuck outside freezing. Bruce Kirkland, writing for Jam! Movies, stupidly claims that Araceli Sgarra was in the movie simply as sex appeal and, even worse, that 'members of at least one climbing team just crawled back in their tents and ignored the crisis.'Normally this wouldn't be such a big deal. So a bunch of boneheads completely missed the point and clearly have no idea about what really happened on the mountain, and are just writing reviews pretending like they have some right to criticize events and actions that they don't understand, right? Wrong. First of all, Mr. Kirkland displays a prodigious capacity for ignorance, apparently having managed to sit through this entire film and still not realize that no climber on earth could make it to the top of Everest without massive climbing skills. So much for that ridiculous little 'sex appeal' theory. The first Spanish woman ever to reach the summit of Everest, and this moron can do nothing but call her sex appeal. Please.Second, there is nothing worse than people making accusations when they clearly have not read Krakauer's book. The IMAX expedition simply coincided with the tragic events that unfolded on Mt. Everest in May of 1996, it is not a documentary of those events. This is why the movie does not go into detail about what happens besides Liam Neeson describing them briefly in the voice-over, and is also why we now have so many people posting scathing reviews about a tragedy that they know nothing about. I would love to see the expression on one of these people's faces if they were asked why May 1996 was the deadliest month in the history of Everest, and yet given the statistics, actually had less deaths than the average year.The people that 'just crawled back in their tents and ignored the crisis,' a group of people which included Jon Krakauer himself, did so for three reasons. First, because they were literally freezing to death. Frostbite had long since begun to set in, they were in the middle of a high-altitude storm, and the wind-chill was such that it would make short work of warm-blooded humans stuck in it. Second, because they were so exhausted that they could barely move. Please remember that these people, at that altitude, could only take a few steps before having to lean over their ice-axes, panting for breath in the dangerously thin air. It does not require a cognitive workout to realize that for people who can hardly stand up to attempt a rescue effort would do nothing but add themselves to the death toll. Third, and most importantly, they didn't even know that there was a tragedy unfolding outside. It is more than a little difficult, Mr. Kirkland, to 'ignore' events that you don't even know are occurring.In Into Thin Air, tragedy does not begin to unfold until almost 300 pages into the book, the IMAX movie passes that point in less than 15 minutes. The point was not to document the tragedies that unfolded, but to give viewers an unparalleled look at Mt. Everest itself, a monumental task at which it is hugely successful. I just wish there was more stock footage and less re-enactments, because there were scenes immediately recognizable from the book that were clearly not shot on location or during the actual events, like the conversation with the stranded Rob Hall. I have no illusions. I'll probably never even set foot in Nepal, and would never make it to the top of Mt. Everest even I did. Director David Breashears not only went to the top, but brought along an IMAX camera so the rest of us could see it, too. In a startling act of heroism, when he and his team learned of the tragic events occurring at higher altitudes, as they were on their way up, they immediately abandoned their $5.5 million IMAX project to participate in the rescue effort, providing their more than 300 pounds of oxygen canisters to whoever needed them. It was not until the rescue effort had saved as many lives as they could that the IMAX team regrouped to decide whether they should still try to salvage their film project. While I was not able to see Everest at an IMAX theater, I was still impressed with it on the small screen, probably because I had read Into Thin Air literally the day before I watched this film, and was able appreciate what these people went through on their expeditions. There are a lot of reviewers on the IMDb who say the movie is pointless to watch on a small screen, but it is only pointless if your imagination is so small that a smaller presentation is not enough for you to understand the sheer magnitude of the event. I could have done without the Jurassic Park music throughout the film, because it only tries to add to the greatness of the mountain, the expeditions, and the people involved, when no augmentation was necessary. It is not because the screen is small that the music seems trite, but because it's not necessary. Everest's soundtrack could have been nothing but wind across the microphone and it would have been more than sufficient.Since I had read the book so soon before I watched the movie, I had an unfair expectation to see more coverage of the events that I had read about, because Jon Krakauer goes into stunning detail, covering every aspect of the expedition. It was not until I read some reviews of Everest, particularly on the IMDb, when I really appreciated the quality of the film and was startled by the idiocy of the people writing about it. The film is marketed by its connection with Into Thin Air, but unfortunately its association with that book only detracts from the movie because of its separation from it. Associating it with the book gives the impression that it will cover some of the same events, which it does with unfortunate brevity, and worst of all, the association of the film with Krakauer's book gives some viewers the impression that they know what happened on the mountain just because they have seen this film. No one who has not read Into Thin Air has any right whatsoever to criticize anything that happened on Mt. Everest in May 1996.

It is more than a little difficult, Mr. Kirkland, to 'ignore' events that you don't even know are occurring.In Into Thin Air, tragedy does not begin to unfold until almost 300 pages into the book, the IMAX movie passes that point in less than 15 minutes. The point was not to document the tragedies that unfolded, but to give viewers an unparalleled look at Mt. Everest itself, a monumental task at which it is hugely successful. I just wish there was more stock footage and less re-enactments, because there were scenes immediately recognizable from the book that were clearly not shot on location or during the actual events, like the conversation with the stranded Rob Hall. I have no illusions. I'll probably never even set foot in Nepal, and would never make it to the top of Mt. Everest even I did. Director David Breashears not only went to the top, but brought along an IMAX camera so the rest of us could see it, too. In a startling act of heroism, when he and his team learned of the tragic events occurring at higher altitudes, as they were on their way up, they immediately abandoned their $5.5 million IMAX project to participate in the rescue effort, providing their more than 300 pounds of oxygen canisters to whoever needed them. It was not until the rescue effort had saved as many lives as they could that the IMAX team regrouped to decide whether they should still try to salvage their film project. While I was not able to see Everest at an IMAX theater, I was still impressed with it on the small screen, probably because I had read Into Thin Air literally the day before I watched this film, and was able appreciate what these people went through on their expeditions. There are a lot of reviewers on the IMDb who say the movie is pointless to watch on a small screen, but it is only pointless if your imagination is so small that a smaller presentation is not enough for you to understand the sheer magnitude of the event. I could have done without the Jurassic Park music throughout the film, because it only tries to add to the greatness of the mountain, the expeditions, and the people involved, when no augmentation was necessary. It is not because the screen is small that the music seems trite, but because it's not necessary. Everest's soundtrack could have been nothing but wind across the microphone and it would have been more than sufficient.Since I had read the book so soon before I watched the movie, I had an unfair expectation to see more coverage of the events that I had read about, because Jon Krakauer goes into stunning detail, covering every aspect of the expedition. It was not until I read some reviews of Everest, particularly on the IMDb, when I really appreciated the quality of the film and was startled by the idiocy of the people writing about it. The film is marketed by its connection with Into Thin Air, but unfortunately its association with that book only detracts from the movie because of its separation from it. Associating it with the book gives the impression that it will cover some of the same events, which it does with unfortunate brevity, and worst of all, the association of the film with Krakauer's book gives some viewers the impression that they know what happened on the mountain just because they have seen this film. No one who has not read Into Thin Air has any right whatsoever to criticize anything that happened on Mt. Everest in May 1996. ","genre":"Documentary, Short"},{"date":"30 November 2004","score":"45 out of 48 people found the following review useful","review":" A lot of times I browse through other reviews when contemplating what I want to say about a movie, and never have I been more disturbed than by reading people's reviews of this film. One IMDb reviewer placed a post on the page for Everest (2005) in which he attacked Jon Krakauer, author of the spectacular novel Into Thin Air, not only of selfishly misrepresenting the actions of people on the mountain, but also of sleeping away in his tent while people were stuck outside freezing. Bruce Kirkland, writing for Jam! Movies, stupidly claims that Araceli Sgarra was in the movie simply as sex appeal and, even worse, that 'members of at least one climbing team just crawled back in their tents and ignored the crisis.'Normally this wouldn't be such a big deal. So a bunch of boneheads completely missed the point and clearly have no idea about what really happened on the mountain, and are just writing reviews pretending like they have some right to criticize events and actions that they don't understand, right? Wrong. First of all, Mr. Kirkland displays a prodigious capacity for ignorance, apparently having managed to sit through this entire film and still not realize that no climber on earth could make it to the top of Everest without massive climbing skills. So much for that ridiculous little 'sex appeal' theory. The first Spanish woman ever to reach the summit of Everest, and this moron can do nothing but call her sex appeal. Please.Second, there is nothing worse than people making accusations when they clearly have not read Krakauer's book. The IMAX expedition simply coincided with the tragic events that unfolded on Mt. Everest in May of 1996, it is not a documentary of those events. This is why the movie does not go into detail about what happens besides Liam Neeson describing them briefly in the voice-over, and is also why we now have so many people posting scathing reviews about a tragedy that they know nothing about. I would love to see the expression on one of these people's faces if they were asked why May 1996 was the deadliest month in the history of Everest, and yet given the statistics, actually had less deaths than the average year.The people that 'just crawled back in their tents and ignored the crisis,' a group of people which included Jon Krakauer himself, did so for three reasons. First, because they were literally freezing to death. Frostbite had long since begun to set in, they were in the middle of a high-altitude storm, and the wind-chill was such that it would make short work of warm-blooded humans stuck in it. Second, because they were so exhausted that they could barely move. Please remember that these people, at that altitude, could only take a few steps before having to lean over their ice-axes, panting for breath in the dangerously thin air. It does not require a cognitive workout to realize that for people who can hardly stand up to attempt a rescue effort would do nothing but add themselves to the death toll. Third, and most importantly, they didn't even know that there was a tragedy unfolding outside.

While all of them (even Dead Man and Year of the Horse, movies that boggled my mind with how strange they were) carry a level of off-beat, original, and fresh kind of film-making prowess, I think my favorite (hard to say 'best' with this director) is with this film, Mystery Train. Plot-wise, it's the obvious precursor to Tarantino's Pulp Fiction (and it's understandable that QT saw this- he did, after all, include Elvis as a practical spiritual adviser for Clarence in True Romance, beside the point). The idea behind both films is very similar, but of course executed in entirely different trajectories - one person or place has a level of importance for what will happen to the characters in the film (with 'Pulp' it was Marsellus Wallace; with 'Mystery' it's the Hotel run by Screaming' Jay Hawkins, and the song Blue Moon on radio). On its own terms, Mystery Train comes out entertaining if one doesn't want to think about the timing of the plot, even if that is carefully, almost architecturally constructed.Although the second and third stories are linked by character associations, the first is a stand-alone segment that looks like if it was just on paper could make for a calm, witty short story. As it is in the film, the Japanese couple Far from Yokohama featuring actors Masatoshi Nagase and Yôki Kudô, is an inviting first part of the film, almost entirely in Japanese subtitles, and playing off of the lady's love of Elvis, and the guy's quiet love for Carl Perkins (a name I didn't really know until I asked around). A steady pace is kicked off by Jarmusch, working more on mood than on a conventional story, and it is something that works rather well. Interesting still is how he sets up other little bits with supporting characters as the leads unfurls- this being an occasional couple of lines between Hawkins and down-beat bellboy Cinque Lee (there are also very quick shots of Steve Buscemi as a barber, the only small connection to the other two stories, and Rufus Thomas at the station). Sometimes the couple bicker, but never with a rush of intensity, and when the scene comes to a passionate close, it's really wonderful how it can be touching at being subtle.The second story, Ghost, is faster, with more of a high-key for humor. Nicoletta Braschi (Roberto Benigni's wife in most films as in life) is astray in Memphis on a flight, and instead of seeking out Elvis gets it delivered to her in a vision while in a hotel room with a talky Jersey Girl (Elizabeth Bracco). It's a complete kind of surreal scene that acts as the fine top-off to a set of odder circumstances that bring her to the hotel (in particular Tom Noonan in one of the funniest small roles I've seen in any Jarmusch film). Once again, the little things keep this thing floating with a stack of magazines, and of course, all that music on the radio.The third story, Lost in Space, is when Jarmusch turns up the energy, which means not as far as you might expect. What he does get is a kind of three-character triangle that some-what reminded me of a sequence in The Last Detail three characters that are totally smashed, with nothing else except to crash in the hotel. But with this story, two performances shine through unexpectedly Joe Strummer as a fuming, gun-toting Brit and Steve Buscemi in his early days as his brother in-law. The climax to this scene- in essence the climax to the whole film- is one that is on par, at least comparable, to the climax of Pulp Fiction, as a wild, dead-serious and dead-funny accumulation of events tying things together.Two facets that make Jarmusch's vision work are, for one thing, that he has Robby Mueller, a bit of a God in the world of modern European cinematographers. His scenes are lit sometimes with all the realism and fantasy of a European fantasy film, but also with a careful eye in composition and getting unusual angles on things a simple as photographing two people in bed or a person walking alone with Memphis in the backdrop. The other facet includes the city itself, with its quality of attracting and leading in people who are unique to the city, and (sometimes) particular to the music. On top of Jarmusch regular John Lurie on the guitar and harmonica, he brings in songs that remind me how much I can get into this kind of music with the right setting. They- Elvis, Orbison, and Sam Phillips among others- contribute just as much as the actors do. Mystery Train may be one of the quintessential 80's indie films (which can be said of Stinger than Paradise and Down by Law as well), that welcomes anyone who might be interested to watch, and if you don't like it, it's not at the worst offensive to taste. It's a keen film on people, music, and devotion.

Dr. No was released in 1962 with the relatively unknown Sean Connery in the leading role. The original Bond author, Ian Fleming, was still alive at the time and wasn't very pleased with the casting of Connery, though he soon warmed to the actor's interpretation of the role when he saw the film.The big question is how does Dr. No hold up over forty years on? Personally it has always been my favourite Bond movie and probably will never be surpassed. Even now, it is a step ahead of its counterparts. Connery never appeared in a better Bond flick (some were close), much less Lazenby, Moore, Dalton or Brosnan.James Bond (Connery) of the British Secret Service is sent to Jamaica to investigate the death of an operative named Strangeway. He learns that Strangeway was looking into alarmingly high radiation readings generating from a nearby island called Crab Cay. Bond heads to the island and learns that it is a suspiciously heavily guarded place, patrolled by gunmen, dogs and armed boats, and none of the local islanders dare venture near because of rumours that a dragon also guards the area. Aided by a Jamaican agent called Quarrel (John Kitzmiller) and beautiful diver Honey Ryder (Ursula Andress), Bond searches the island's interior for answers. He discovers that the island is run by the deadly Dr. No (Joseph Wiseman), a visionary megalomaniac who plans to disrupt the American space programme by sabotaging their shuttles from his secret island base, using gyroscopic interference to bring them down mid-flight.As the series went on, it became less and less related to the Bond of Fleming's creation, and increasingly akin to a comic book. Part of the strength of Dr. No is that it is faithful to its source. I've read Dr. No, and it is such a good book that it didn't really need altering beyond all recognition in order to be filmable - so, it's nice to report that scripters Richard Maibaum, Johanna Harwood and Berkely Mather have adapted it accurately. The performances are excellent Connery confident and masculine as Bond, Andress jaw-droppingly gorgeous as Honey, and Wiseman fabulously sinister as Dr. No. Terence Young directs with urgency, getting plenty of excitement as well as some lovely location photography into his film (hard to believe he would go on to make such inept bombs as Poppies Are Also Flowers, Bloodline, and Inchon). Dr. No is a milestone in cinema history. It is the film that gave us our first big-screen 007; it is the grand-daddy of all globe-trotting adventure flicks; and it is a classic action film in its own right to boot.

The performances are incredible. The writing makes the story accessible to everyone. There's plenty of humor to keep things light. There's grandeur on a scale that few movies have ever matched. Yet, in spite of all, the story remains about people. You care about these people before the movie's done, even Rameses the pharaoh.The animation is equal to anything ever done, even though the movie was released six years ago. The special effects used are truly breathtaking in the way they're presented.

Thanks are mostly due to it's director, the craftsmen who worked on the title creature and the charms of leading lady Adams. Deep in the Amazon, researchers find a fossilized claw that leads to an expedition up river to The Black Lagoon in order to locate any other remains. What they find, however, is a living example of the species and he isn't particularly pleased to have been discovered! One scientist, Carlson, wants to pretty much leave the creature alone and just study it and collect more information from the area. Another one, Denning, wants to capture it and bring it back to the US for experimentation and exhibition. Once the creature lays eyes on Adams, what the men want no longer matters as he begins to attack anyone who gets in the way of his courtship. The film (originally presented in 3-D, which doubtlessly enhanced all the shots of his claw coming out from behind rocks and other various items coming towards the camera) is almost quaint when compared to the slice-and-dice flicks that have come about in the half century since its release. It's more fun than scary, yet there remains some suspense and it's enjoyable viewing no matter what (and the first underwater encounter is still creepy as the Gill Man appears against some rocks and then juts out.) Carlson and Denning are both bland in their roles, though Denning, as the nastier of the two, gets a little more to work with. Adams is gorgeous and gives a performance that is surprisingly natural in that era of intense artifice. Somehow the film manages to be both campy and serious, schlocky and high grade all at the same time. The Gill Man's suit is a remarkable creation and the swimmer inside gets surprising mobility and speed going. It is ridiculous, however, when the humans are able to out-swim him. It's not possible for a man with a tank, face mask and flippers on to out-paddle a creature who lives underwater! The view of the scientists is fascinatingly bizarre. They explore this completely untouched area of the world and proceed to flick cigarette butts into the river and then poison the water, bringing scores of dead fish to the surface! Also, Adams hilariously changes clothes for every scene, apparently inspiring Ginger Grant from Gilligan's Island to make sure that no boat trip occurs without a steamer trunk of apparel. (Look for the scene in which Adams' ponytail wraps around one of the ropes on deck!) By the time she does an Esther Williams routine (in the Amazon River?!), as lovely as she is, the camp factor is in full swing. Other unintentional laughs occur when Denning and Carlson are duking it out below deck while a fully bandaged Bissell lies on a bunk, powerless to point out that the creature's hand is making it's way through an open porthole! Still, enough skill exists in the film to overcome most of the goofy aspects. The music cue that blares almost every time the creature appears is at once amusing, yet startling, and thoroughly memorable. It's odd to say that a horror film is pleasant, but that's just what this is. It's short, compelling, fun, captivating and endearing.

This is a gory, yet honest tale of a self-obsessed, arrogant, and repulsive New York yuppie (Christian Bale) in 1980s Wall Street, who wakes up behind a mask, is addicted to cleansing and grooming, listens objectively to Phil Collins music, goes to work, inflicts his verbal rage upon his clientele and friends, arrives back at his penthouse apartment with a lady friend or two, and proceeds to literally mutilate his company, as the cycle goes every day. We can hardly sympathize or even begin to understand this man (Patrick Bateman)'s troubles, frustrations, and compulsive wraths, for he hasn't anything to be infuriated about he's young, dashing, rich, and can afford any possession or woman of his desire; when his violent rampages manifest, it's anyone's guess as to who or what is perturbing Bateman perhaps he is manufacturing rages for no apparent reason other than out of sheer boredom and lack of interest. He is one of the most arrogant, superficial, vapid, and utterly detestable figures imaginable, and if we weren't conscious of his fascination with Phil Collins and his adoration with looking petite, we might surmise that Bateman hasn't any sensibilities and is virtually inhuman, making him more of a creature than a man. American Psycho is perhaps a social commentary on how appearances can be very deceiving as oblivious characters are enticed into the deranged trap of Bateman, they can only mistake him as being a regular, well-to-do man, without any noticeable deficiencies or dangers, which we realize is quite the contrary to the figure we have come to know and loathe. The film doesn't demand or even any sympathy or understanding for Bateman, but rather, acknowledges his various victims, who are regular dupes in the social landscape of America they (particularly prostitutes) don't really become acquainted with someone, and yet make themselves perfectly available for a deranged psycho such as Bateman, to have them in their possession and proceed, unsuspected by them, to decapitate their body! This is a chilling, engaging, and ultimately surprising film that sometimes gives overabundant weight to its subject (in the purpose of having us despise his repulsive tendencies), and not enough insight as to the reasons behind his psychopathic behavior. Yet perhaps this is excusable, because some psychopathic figures are not worth examining for their inconceivable features, as they haven't any conscience to examine! Christian Bale is fantastically loathsome as Patrick Bateman, in a film that defies to manufacture excuses or insights for its subject's insanity, but rather, suggests that his actions are all concoctions of his own bewildering, despicable, nature.

I am not transported to another fantasy land. I am watching a movie with a kid reading a book that always looks and feels like a book and that has absolutely no magic to it. Sure its our imagination that creates Fantasia but there seems to be nothing magical about this story. No magic, no mystery, a little imagination, no effect.

With MONSOON WEDDING I didn't know what to expect - it looked like the usual romantic comedy; a genre I usually avoid. I was very pleasantly surprised to get a film that very nicely reinvents the genre.This noted it should be said that MONSOON WEDDING tries awfully hard - as the Bollywood mainstream (from what I've seen) is more geared towards escapism and spectacle, this film (in response) packs a lot of issues into it's elaborate plot, and it almost seems a bit overloaded. However Nair - with great skill - keeps it from veering completely out of control, and the results are rich and occasionally touching.*MINOR SPOILERS*I loved the overall story, which is presented as a rather rambling mix of frazzled drama and comedy (the tight orchestration of a sprawling cast does evoke Altman), but certain other threads were very interesting the child-abuse subplot (which - though seeming tacked-on, does evoke the sense of unflinching realism seen throughout SALAAM BOMBAY), the delicate romance between Alice and the wedding planner (the oft-mentioned 'marigold heart' scene is utterly sentimental, but it's also a completely beautiful moment), and Nair's casual reflection of diaspora reality - family members all over the globe reuniting in India for a traditional ceremony pulled together in the face of debt, shifting values and unbelievable stress is yet another glimpse of her knack for detail. This diaspora aspect of the film does deserve a film of it's own, as there were a number of fleeting moments of intrigue (a family member visiting from Australia is quite ambivalent about his own roots, and is once referred to as foreigner) on this front, but MONSOON WEDDING could only accommodate so many issues, and Nair does forge something of a path for other independent Indian or Indian-expatriate filmmakers to delve into.Very rich and rewarding, especially upon a second viewing.
