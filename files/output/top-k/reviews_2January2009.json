Being both a fan of Westerns and of the West in which I have the great privilege of living, I settled in for the nearly four hour Western. Having had time to reflect on the experience, a few observations seem in order. First, the acting is impressive. Christopherson, Walken and Huppert are very good while Waterston is terrifying as a man driven not so much by greed as by a principle of property rights; a riveting performance. The accuracy of attire and equipment is laudable seldom do Westerns, even those set as late as this one, show the use of shoulder holsters that was very common in the old West. The beautiful Blackfeet country of northern Montana makes a passable stand-in for Wyoming. Sadly these positives cannot make up for the two insuperable drawbacks the script and the direction. I do not require absolute historical accuracy as this is not a documentary but when the names of real men and women are used and not even their deaths are accurate there is something terribly wrong. Only Champion dies in anything like the way of death of any of the main characters. Averill and Ella were hanged early on and yet in Heaven's Gate Averill survives to weep on a ship in 1903 while Ella is shot. Why not name these folks Smith and Jones if they are to bear no relationship to their namesakes? There are so many of these departures from reality that for me at least the movie was ruined. It was filled with these but that never happened moments. Further, even granting the rewriting of lives, deaths and professions, why does no one, save the Eastern European immigrants, the station master, soiled doves and the bartenders ever do a lick of work? (I was minded of Ozzie and Harriet with Ozzie never going to work.) Averill and Ella in this version do not have their small spread as they did in life but Averill as a sheriff seems to do little to quell criminal action until the climactic battle. Dancing seemed to happen more frequently that tending cattle and there is nary a cowboy to be found. Who cares for the stockbreeders herds? Never has a movie plot turned on a treasure as invisible as the cattle in Heaven's Gate! The greatest negative however is found in the director for it is apparent that Michael Cimino loathes the Western and, even more sadly, the West. This comes though in the dust and smoke, the lowering skies, the camera angles, and the drab colouring of everything. Other anti-Westerns, especially Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch mourn the passing of the old West with a revisionist story but a heart that loves the West. One may hate the Western movies but love the West; Cimino obviously hates both. This cripples Heaven's Gate. Anyone who can manage to make Montana less than gorgeous must be working very hard. I know this country well and while some mountains were familiar, the use of camera angles etc nullifies the beauty. I guess if one works hard enough one could make even Sarah Michelle Gellar look homely, though I cannot think of why one would do this. Similarly, why would one work so hard to make the High Plains and Eastern Slopes of the Rockies less than they are? That Heaven's Gate was a flop is sad, especially for United Artists, but sadder still is that such a talented director could so dislike the West itself.

Luc Besson's film The Professional gives unlikelihood a whole new meaning as its focus is on a professional hit-man and a troubled, 12-year-old girl. Naturally there's a lot these two can learn from each other and probably a lot they shouldn't, but it all makes for interesting and compelling material.Leon, played by Jean Reno, is a highly skilled, elusive hit-man who works for an Italian mob leader. He's also an immigrant with no means of being completely self-sufficient (he can't read or write and doesn't keep his own finances). He also lives in a run-down NYC apartment next to a family with an abusive, dope-dealing father. When the father gets into trouble, a psychotic and corrupt cop (Oldman) has his whole family taken out. Only Mathilda (Portman), the youngest daughter, survives. With nowhere to go when she's supposed to be dead, she turns to Leon.Leon and Mathilda form a unique bond. Both Reno and Portman are perfect in their roles. Leon is a creature of habit whose sensitive side comes out in caring for this young girl and Portman portrays both the beauty and innocence of a 12-year-old girl who at the same time is highly motivated by vengeance and a sense of inescapable maturity. You can certainly see why Portman was destined to be a successful actress. Mathilda's persistence to learn Leon's craft and his acceptance eventually is a bit disturbing and hard to grasp at first, but the more time they spend together, the more you love their relationship. You get a sense for how sweet Mathilda is and how good-hearted Leon, an assassin, can be. Besson also focuses on both actors' strongest trait their eyes, which are highly communicative of these ideas.The complications that arise when Mathilda tries to seek her own vengeance against Oldman's character further complicates the nature of this unlikely friendship, exposing it for how dangerous it is, but also testing its merit--showing us how strong it can be. The action scenes that arise from this plot are also sure to satisfy those who want The Professional to deliver on that end, even if it's far from the focus. It's really about this friendship and to be honest, there could have been even more from the two of them it was almost as if (and it may be the case) the American release was stripped in places by producers to emphasize the action pieces for fear the film couldn't thrive on the relationship element.Oldman is another piece that shouldn't go unmentioned. Though his character isn't given much depth to warrant high acclaim, Oldman is quite terrifying in his own way. It certainly offers explanation for his slew of villain roles in the 90s.Besson has really given all of us gun-toting-movie lovers something to chew on here, which is really the film's greatest achievement. While countless crime dramas, thrillers and action films glorify the gun, Besson shows it for how terrifying it is, even if he does have to use Hollywood elements at times to keep the film's pace up. The Professional really has it's own special place in the wide array of assassin films.

This slipped through the usual glut of Hollywood movies, but it has so many facets, so much to say, combined with a delightful story and a wonderful cast to fill it out.Most people expect certain things from the headliner of this story, Jim Carrey, who's made a career of physical comedy with such favorites as Ace Ventura Pet Detective and The Mask, but The Truman Show showed his true acting potential, giving a range that hasn't truly been seen yet. As Peter Appleton, the amnesiac protagonist, he comes across as genuine and real as he moves through the movie, avoiding the comedic talents Mr. Carrey's known for and playing it straight. Many agree that this might not be his best work but it certainly is up there.But while the lead actor is great in the role, Mr. Carrey couldn't have sold this if not for a story which, despite the time it's set in, still echoes in the present. Many of the themes are timeless, drawing the audience in despite the decades that have passed and the generation gap. Without any spoilers, the story starts with known events of the age, embroiling the protagonist in the insidiousness, forcing him to escape, and in this, he begins a journey to find a new self he didn't even know he needed. By the end of the movie, Mr. Appleton is different, changed, by the people he's met along the way. There's subtle humor and romance intertwined through the story, while also touching upon the sense of loss the country felt after World War II to acknowledge, nay, honor the sacrifices made in that war.The rest of the cast comes across believably in their roles and make you care for those you're meant to, to loathe those you should loathe. Laurie Holden, as the confident Adele, shines on screen, particularly when paired with Mr. Carrey. As Peter's would-be father Harry, Martin Landau brings the character to life, letting the viewer feel the pain Harry goes through, the joy when he thinks the son he lost in war has returned home, and the quiet peace in Harry's final scene. Without the support of a great cast, The Majestic wouldn't have worked.In all, watch this once with an open mind and no preconceptions of the actors in it or the type of movie it is. This is one movie I can never pass up watching, even though I know it by heart and have seen it hundreds of times already over the years. This is not Oscar material, but it's a simple, well-crafted movie nonetheless, harking back to a different time when story, not effects or controversy, was what drew people to the movies.

This slipped through the usual glut of Hollywood movies, but it has so many facets, so much to say, combined with a delightful story and a wonderful cast to fill it out.Most people expect certain things from the headliner of this story, Jim Carrey, who's made a career of physical comedy with such favorites as Ace Ventura Pet Detective and The Mask, but The Truman Show showed his true acting potential, giving a range that hasn't truly been seen yet. As Peter Appleton, the amnesiac protagonist, he comes across as genuine and real as he moves through the movie, avoiding the comedic talents Mr. Carrey's known for and playing it straight. Many agree that this might not be his best work but it certainly is up there.But while the lead actor is great in the role, Mr. Carrey couldn't have sold this if not for a story which, despite the time it's set in, still echoes in the present. Many of the themes are timeless, drawing the audience in despite the decades that have passed and the generation gap. Without any spoilers, the story starts with known events of the age, embroiling the protagonist in the insidiousness, forcing him to escape, and in this, he begins a journey to find a new self he didn't even know he needed. By the end of the movie, Mr. Appleton is different, changed, by the people he's met along the way. There's subtle humor and romance intertwined through the story, while also touching upon the sense of loss the country felt after World War II to acknowledge, nay, honor the sacrifices made in that war.The rest of the cast comes across believably in their roles and make you care for those you're meant to, to loathe those you should loathe. Laurie Holden, as the confident Adele, shines on screen, particularly when paired with Mr. Carrey. As Peter's would-be father Harry, Martin Landau brings the character to life, letting the viewer feel the pain Harry goes through, the joy when he thinks the son he lost in war has returned home, and the quiet peace in Harry's final scene. Without the support of a great cast, The Majestic wouldn't have worked.In all, watch this once with an open mind and no preconceptions of the actors in it or the type of movie it is. This is one movie I can never pass up watching, even though I know it by heart and have seen it hundreds of times already over the years. This is not Oscar material, but it's a simple, well-crafted movie nonetheless, harking back to a different time when story, not effects or controversy, was what drew people to the movies.

I love how it shows how powerful friendship can be. One of my favorite Disney movies of all time.My favorite characters are the adult Tod and Chief. Tod's voice was Mickey Rooney who was also the voice of all the Santa Claus' in Santa Claus is coming to town and a year without Santa Claus which I thought was awesome. Also the personality of Tod is a lot like my own. He is very playful and out-going. Even though Copper, the hound and old best friend tries to hunt Tod down, Tod still comes back and helps his best friend out. Chief is also a lot like me. I am an older step-brother. So when my younger brother came around I felt like I get the back seat to him.The songs aren't all that great but they fit in with the movie so well. People say that this movie isn't a good kids movie but that's not true. I watched it with my six year old cousin and she loved it.My favorite part of this movie is the end where the camera zooms out from Copper and Chief. Then it says Copper, your my very best friend. And your mine to Tod. and so on. Every time I see that I can't help but smile.This was a great Disney movie and I'm a huge fan of Disney. Fox and the Hound is a great addition to the magical world of Disney.

Some give you a positive momentary taste. Very few films give you spiritual nourishment that you can savor for years to come. Fearless (1993) is such a film. I hope someday there will be a DVD package worthy of such a courageous and moving experience. Assuming the brilliance of all involved, especially Peter Weir (director), Rafael Yglesisas (Writer), and all of the actors, this profound viewing experience changed how I look at life. One very perceptive friend described the plot as a journey from not dead to alive. Max Klein (Jeff Bridges) makes such a journey, but not alone, even if he thinks to the contrary. This is also one of the best depictions of marriage on screen. The scenes between Bridges and Isabella Rosselini really crackle with emotion and intensity. It's rare to see a marital conflict where you can sympathize and even empathize with both characters. That is a tribute to Isabella and the writing\/directing. Also successful (though not as universal) is the strange relationship between Max and Carla (Rosie Perez). Nice atypical work from John Turturro, Benecio Del Toro, and Tom Hulce provides some much-needed humor.Also, this film avoids dwelling on the simple psychological clichés of PTSD and survivor guilt. Instead of talking about it, the viewer sees, feels and experiences it. This is a rare gem of film history and one of the most overlooked movies in history. Here's hoping that changes soon.

Larry manages to kill the werewolf but is bitten in the process, which causes him to turn were himself. This of course leads to all sorts of problems and self-loathing.The Wolf Man is a fine movie and rightly praised for its merits. Lon Chaney Jr provides an excellent performance as Larry Talbot\/the Wolf Man, (though at times I personally found his character a bit whiney) and the supporting cast is also good.The story moves along well, and the settings are appropriate. The script has some clever dialog and the characters are built up nicely.But for some reason, this is my least favorite of the big Universal monster pictures. I'm not sure why, except that it doesn't affect me the way that some of the others do. Frankenstein's creature was a very tragic person but still strong and simply misunderstood. Dracula was suave but thoroughly evil. The Creature from the Black Lagoon is just such a beautiful picture. And I love Karloff's portrayal of The Mummy. But while Lon Chaney is tragic as the werewolf, I simply don't have any real emotional connection to his character-maybe because I would have liked to see him stronger in dealing with his affliction.
