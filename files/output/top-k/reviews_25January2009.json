Already we know that we are in the universe of the man behind Brazil, Terry Gilliam as the expectation caused by the opening chords is quickly subverted by the grim wartime feeling of a starving city under siege by the Turks. Even death itself makes an early appearance, a black winged skeletal angel that will continue to show up throughout the film and which seems to presage an ominous and early end indeed for the characters we meet in the beginning. Young Sally is the daughter of a traveling actor (and head of his theatrical troupe) who plays the magical Baron Munchausen, a fabulous hero famed for his tall tales revolving around such feats as a trip to the moon and the theft of a sultan's treasure. The pathetic troupe puts on its poor mockery of theater in a disintegrating, cavernous building as the town's leader, the Right Ordinary Horatio Jackson (note that title), only to be upstaged by the real Baron (John Neville), a drunken and crazy old man - with a real and sharp sword - who proceeds to tell the story of how the town got into this mess....Gilliam's film is the summation of all of his work as director up until this point, blending the childhood wonder of Time Bandits, the satire on bureaucracy and the feeling for the importance of imagination in the face of hopeless rationality of Brazil, the broad humor of Monty Python and the references to Alice in Wonderland and medieval romance and tall tales of Jabberwocky. Most of the film charts in a relatively linear way the adventures of the (real) Baron and Sally as they fly off in a balloon made of ladies' underwear in search of Munchausen's four fabulous servants - all of whom we have glimpsed in the opening scene, denying that they are anything but actors. Is the Baron crazy? Is the child Sally the only one who believes him, or in fact the only one who can experience his exploits, or save him from death? The film explores these and many other questions of storytelling and belief and the Baron grows more youthful with success, ages with failure -- as his friends seem at first not to recognize him, and then to be too old and feeble to help him. The baron himself loses faith at times, and only Sally is there to prop him up. At the end, a mind-boggling mixture of battles, triumph, death and funeral, resurrection and above all the Story of The Way It Should End all fuse into one of the most joyous and potent conclusions in film.Gilliam draws on a wonderful array of sources for this film, which is certainly postmodern in the lightest yet most serious and beautiful sense - there are nods to Alice in Wonderland, The Wizard of Oz, Pinocchio, Renaissance painting, Cyrano de Bergerac and the 1940 Thief of Bagdad among countless others, but the film never seems derivative or obvious; always it is focused on the pure joy of the tale and the strength and power of myth-making in the face of the tedium and joylessness represented by the unscrupulous and ultimately murderous Jackson - played with vicious glee by Jonathan Pryce in an ironic reversal of his role in Gilliam's previous film, Brazil.The cast is uniformly fine -- some may be irritated by Polley's admittedly shrill Sally though it seemed an appropriate (and necessary) characterization to me -- with standouts being Pryce, Eric Idle as the fleet-footed but somewhat dimwitted Berthold, and John Neville as the Baron in one of the most unjustly slighted performances from a banner year for film. Giuseppe Rotunno's photography makes much more of an impact on the big screen for sure but it is certainly beautiful enough (particularly in the outdoors\/sky sequences) even on the DVD; and Michael Kamen's score is one of my all-time favorites and possibly the best work in his film career. The dialog may strike some as odd, in its mixture of late-20th-century idioms (particularly when voiced by the King of the Moon, Robin Williams) and the more carefully authentic 200-year-old jargon of characters like Jackson -- but like most elements of the film, this is carefully designed to throw us off and keep our sense of what is real and not always in doubt.This is a film I've seen over and over - it scored a big impression when I saw it new, alas not on very many people - and it grows greater with each re-watch. Gilliam really manages here to articulate a very profound statement about how we are losing out way, about how the bottom line and the rational way of winning a war - or making a film - may in fact be heartless, cold, and ultimately more dead than the Baron seems to be just before the triumphant finish of the film.Tied for my favorite film in the toughest year for me to pick a winner, with fellow masterpieces Distant Voices, Still Lives and The Last Temptation of Christ. Easily Gilliam's best film, and in its failure ultimately a signal for a new and less potent (though still interesting) direction in his work. A triumph then, and a tragedy - the film is the career, the career is the film.

One night, he is awoken and brought to Slumberland where he is to become heir to the throne. He is given a key and is told to never open a certain door, and upon meeting a troublemaker named Flip, is convinced to open said door. Upon doing so, he unleashes the Nightmare King, who has been locked away for generations. The Nightmare King kidnaps the king of Slumberland, and now Nemo must venture to Nightmare Land in order to destroy the Nightmare King and bring peace back to Slumberland.This movie is very personal to me. I used to watch a lot of movies as a kid, and this was one of them. I can't count how many times I used to watch it. I was around 8 or 9 years old, and from what I can remember, this movie frightened me. I had dreams of my own that were similar to Nemo's, and maybe that is why it frightened me so much. But somewhere along the line, this film became another part of my collection, sitting in a cabinet for 11 years, collecting dust. That is until, at work, I started reminiscing about this film. I remembered how some scenes that I could recall scared me so much, and some of the songs, and the overall reality that the movie made me feel back then, and I dug the old tape up and popped it in my VCR.I couldn't believe it.Everything I remembered from my childhood flashed before my eyes. It was like going back to a time when things were much more simple. No worrying about money, work, girlfriends, or the overall necessities of everyday life. This kid, Nemo, kind of embodied me as a child. A little bit different, but he had that same childhood curiosity and energy that I remember myself having. For the hour and a half that this movie goes for it feels like being a kid again. It's a very rare nostalgia, one I have never felt before, and I don't think that feeling will ever go away. I am 19 years old now. If I move, this movie will travel with me, even if I bring no more of my old VHS movies. It will be given to my children, if I ever have any, so they can experience the same feelings that I used to feel.That's my little part of the story when it comes to this film.But don't think I'm bias, giving this movie a 5 out of 5 just because of the nostalgia factor.Little Nemo is a great family film. For the amount of animated movies I used to like as a child, I'll be the first to admit that some of them were pretty painful to watch as an adult. If only I knew what my parents felt towards some of those old movies. However, they said out of some of the movies I used to watch, they enjoyed this one. But who couldn't? It's cute AND action-packed! Some of the voice acting is just awesome. I'm actually referring more so to Mickey Rooney's performance as Flip. He really gives it his all when all the other voice actors might not be. Flip's full of personality and he really embodies that friend that peer pressured you a lot when you were a kid, which is what I think they were going for. Some people might disagree, but I enjoyed Gabriel Damon's performance as Nemo, even though most of his lines include Shazama Pajama or Yippee!. I just can't stop thinking about the scene in the beginning where Nemo is running away from a train and is telling his mom that they need to get out of the house. Reminds me of a few dreams I used to have.The animation is very fluid. Whoever said that this movie wasn't very Disney-like at this movie's theatrical release is an idiot. I don't think it was meant to be. The whole movie looks and runs like a really good Anime. Considering it was animated in Japan, the whole Disney animation comparison really just doesn't make a heck of a lot of sense. But for a budget of $35 million, the animation better be good. It was, and still is. Just search the movie up on YouTube and you'll see what I mean.There is one thing I don't like in the film, although I'll tolerate them, and that is the Oomps. I probably just offended some fans of this movie. If so, sorry. Some may like them, but I don't. They were annoying as a kid, and are still pretty annoying now. Their song is dumb, some of their lines are stupid, and they are overall embarrassing to watch. Of course, in the end, they help Nemo out tremendously. But they still annoy me. Every time I watch the movie however, I like them a tiny bit more.I'm really happy this movie was made, and to find people on IMDb who share the same feelings about it as I do. I will treasure this movie forever, and I don't care who knows that my favorite movie of all time is a kid's movie. Out of all the movies I've watched in my life (I have watched so many), this movie stands out. It is one of my favorite possessions and will never be sold or given up to anyone. I love this movie!

I was around 8 or 9 years old, and from what I can remember, this movie frightened me. I had dreams of my own that were similar to Nemo's, and maybe that is why it frightened me so much. But somewhere along the line, this film became another part of my collection, sitting in a cabinet for 11 years, collecting dust. That is until, at work, I started reminiscing about this film. I remembered how some scenes that I could recall scared me so much, and some of the songs, and the overall reality that the movie made me feel back then, and I dug the old tape up and popped it in my VCR.I couldn't believe it.Everything I remembered from my childhood flashed before my eyes. It was like going back to a time when things were much more simple. No worrying about money, work, girlfriends, or the overall necessities of everyday life. This kid, Nemo, kind of embodied me as a child. A little bit different, but he had that same childhood curiosity and energy that I remember myself having. For the hour and a half that this movie goes for it feels like being a kid again. It's a very rare nostalgia, one I have never felt before, and I don't think that feeling will ever go away. I am 19 years old now. If I move, this movie will travel with me, even if I bring no more of my old VHS movies. It will be given to my children, if I ever have any, so they can experience the same feelings that I used to feel.That's my little part of the story when it comes to this film.But don't think I'm bias, giving this movie a 5 out of 5 just because of the nostalgia factor.Little Nemo is a great family film. For the amount of animated movies I used to like as a child, I'll be the first to admit that some of them were pretty painful to watch as an adult. If only I knew what my parents felt towards some of those old movies. However, they said out of some of the movies I used to watch, they enjoyed this one. But who couldn't? It's cute AND action-packed! Some of the voice acting is just awesome. I'm actually referring more so to Mickey Rooney's performance as Flip. He really gives it his all when all the other voice actors might not be. Flip's full of personality and he really embodies that friend that peer pressured you a lot when you were a kid, which is what I think they were going for. Some people might disagree, but I enjoyed Gabriel Damon's performance as Nemo, even though most of his lines include Shazama Pajama or Yippee!. I just can't stop thinking about the scene in the beginning where Nemo is running away from a train and is telling his mom that they need to get out of the house. Reminds me of a few dreams I used to have.The animation is very fluid. Whoever said that this movie wasn't very Disney-like at this movie's theatrical release is an idiot. I don't think it was meant to be. The whole movie looks and runs like a really good Anime. Considering it was animated in Japan, the whole Disney animation comparison really just doesn't make a heck of a lot of sense. But for a budget of $35 million, the animation better be good. It was, and still is. Just search the movie up on YouTube and you'll see what I mean.There is one thing I don't like in the film, although I'll tolerate them, and that is the Oomps. I probably just offended some fans of this movie. If so, sorry. Some may like them, but I don't. They were annoying as a kid, and are still pretty annoying now. Their song is dumb, some of their lines are stupid, and they are overall embarrassing to watch. Of course, in the end, they help Nemo out tremendously. But they still annoy me. Every time I watch the movie however, I like them a tiny bit more.I'm really happy this movie was made, and to find people on IMDb who share the same feelings about it as I do. I will treasure this movie forever, and I don't care who knows that my favorite movie of all time is a kid's movie. Out of all the movies I've watched in my life (I have watched so many), this movie stands out. It is one of my favorite possessions and will never be sold or given up to anyone. I love this movie! If you ever run across a copy, do yourself a favor and watch it, or do your child a favor, and let them watch it.Until next time, Shraylo ","genre":"Family, Animation, Adventure"},{"date":"25 January 2009","score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" It had been quite some years since I had last seen this movie and the earlier brilliant and fresh movie version The Thing from Another World from 1951 was more fresh on my mind.

While its harebrained storyline bungles most of the mystery that compels the novel, the script makes a happy turn toward humor, the most exciting part of the book and by far the best element of the picture. To their profit they lift some of the best scenes directly into the screenplay. W.S. Van Dyke steers the film, mostly by camera placement and actors' performances, squarely into screwball territory. This salvages what could have been a sour punch and makes of it a sweet cocktail, one of those silver screen magic moments that sustains us through the long years of lesser fare.The supporting cast, most of it after Natalie Moorhead is killed, is excellent. Maureen O'Sullivan is as pretty and comfortable in a penthouse with Arrow Shirt men as perched in a tree with that ape son of a bitch Cheetah; her ingenue is not nearly as interesting as the book's dipso head case, but she does exactly what she ought with it, even if the screenwriters don't. Olympic jock Nat Pendleton gives a very nice turn as the thick but not completely stupid cop; Cesar Romero gives a delicious single take as the weary gigolo, in his only real moment of the picture.

He then repairs to the dilapidated saloon for a shot of medicinal red eye before trying to make it back to his home and friends.However, after all he's been through, wounded and in pain, he finds two more men in the saloon, looking for the renegade Josey Wales. One is a stranger. The other is an old acquaintance from the Civil War, John Vernon, who has worked for the Union Army since the surrender.The few people in the saloon are friends of Eastwood's and they lie to the Union men, telling them that Josey Wales was killed dead in a Mexican shoot out. The stranger accepts the story and has one of the customers sign an affidavit to that effect, but Vernon has recognized Eastwood.Eastwood and Vernon step outside, facing each other, and Vernon says he doesn't believe the story about Wales' death. He thinks Wales is still alive and if he encounters him, he'll give him the first move. He owed him that much. Eastwood makes no move to pull any of the several guns he's always packing around. Vernon glances at Eastwood's boot and sees a few drops of blood spattering on the tip. Then Vernon -- and the viewer too -- suddenly realize the ordeal that the tight-lipped Eastwood character has endured, enough hard riding, blood, violence, loss, and murder to last a dozen lifetimes. And Vernon says that if Josey Wales isn't dead, Vernon would tell him, The war is over. A long pause before Eastwood replies, I guess everybody died a little in that war. Eastwood rides off towards home, slouched over in his saddle.I wanted to mention the good part, and it IS well done -- well written and directed -- because the rest of the movie doesn't live up to it. Right off the bat, the Union soldiers from Kansas raid the home of Eastwood, a peaceful farmer, burn his house and kill his wife and children. The rest of the movie is a story of revenge. Revenge is an easy motive to identify with, especially when the pillager and murderer is the evil Bill McKinney who's never played anything BUT brutal and stupid rural characters. (He was the cracker who sodomized Ned Beatty in Deliverance.) Well, revenge is easy to understand, but it can also provide an engine for endless cruelty if one wants it to. Fritz Lang recognized this in his American movies, The Big Heat and Rancho Deluxe. Eastwood pulls off some repugnant stunts here, against people who sometimes are obviously evil and sometimes not.Eastwood not only starred but directed, and his direction shows him at a sort of tipping point between Sergio Leone and Eastwood's own later films. Gigantic close ups of wet faces and glistening teeth alternate with grandiose high shots of galloping horses. Eastwood's Josey Wales is his familiar Western figure, taciturn, slightly mean, given to spitting tobacco juice on dogs, full of provocative insults. Well? You gonna pull those guns or stand there whistlin' Dixie? When he tries to speak in ritualized and poetic English to the Comanches, while making a peace proposal, he fails. Perfumed speech is not his forte. And when he rides off into the sunset, it's without any suggestion of remorse for the hundred or so dead bodies he's left in his wake. Sandra Locke is a fetching young blond who sounds as if she'd just graduated from Vassar. Chief Dan George is fine in everything he does. One suspects he's not acting at all, just trying to get his lines right, but they come out the way they ought to.

At worst, they are treacherous creeps who line up Confederate prisoners at the surrender ceremony and mow them down with Gatling guns.

No mention of the Cherokees owning slaves, just like the plantation owners they learned from. No mention of slavery at all. The Civil War itself is economically reduced to a fuzzy montage of battling figures and an abundance of smoke. All these scenes I've mentioned are dark, cold, and uninviting.

","genre":"Western"},{"date":"25 January 2009","score":"5 out of 12 people found the following review useful","review":" There are about three minutes of genuine pathos in this film and they come at the very end. Clint Eastwood, as the eponymous outlaw, has been pursued across half the nation by bounty hunters, law officers of various types, and Union soldiers. He's just been involved in a gunfight against impossible odds and though he and a few friends have killed all the blue bellies, Eastwood has been wounded in the upper right quadrant.His chief enemy, a viperous Redleg played by Bill McKinney, has ridden away from the fight. Eastwood follows and kills him with his own sabre. He then repairs to the dilapidated saloon for a shot of medicinal red eye before trying to make it back to his home and friends.However, after all he's been through, wounded and in pain, he finds two more men in the saloon, looking for the renegade Josey Wales. One is a stranger. The other is an old acquaintance from the Civil War, John Vernon, who has worked for the Union Army since the surrender.The few people in the saloon are friends of Eastwood's and they lie to the Union men, telling them that Josey Wales was killed dead in a Mexican shoot out. The stranger accepts the story and has one of the customers sign an affidavit to that effect, but Vernon has recognized Eastwood.Eastwood and Vernon step outside, facing each other, and Vernon says he doesn't believe the story about Wales' death. He thinks Wales is still alive and if he encounters him, he'll give him the first move. He owed him that much. Eastwood makes no move to pull any of the several guns he's always packing around. Vernon glances at Eastwood's boot and sees a few drops of blood spattering on the tip. Then Vernon -- and the viewer too -- suddenly realize the ordeal that the tight-lipped Eastwood character has endured, enough hard riding, blood, violence, loss, and murder to last a dozen lifetimes. And Vernon says that if Josey Wales isn't dead, Vernon would tell him, The war is over. A long pause before Eastwood replies, I guess everybody died a little in that war. Eastwood rides off towards home, slouched over in his saddle.I wanted to mention the good part, and it IS well done -- well written and directed -- because the rest of the movie doesn't live up to it. Right off the bat, the Union soldiers from Kansas raid the home of Eastwood, a peaceful farmer, burn his house and kill his wife and children. The rest of the movie is a story of revenge. Revenge is an easy motive to identify with, especially when the pillager and murderer is the evil Bill McKinney who's never played anything BUT brutal and stupid rural characters. (He was the cracker who sodomized Ned Beatty in Deliverance.) Well, revenge is easy to understand, but it can also provide an engine for endless cruelty if one wants it to. Fritz Lang recognized this in his American movies, The Big Heat and Rancho Deluxe. Eastwood pulls off some repugnant stunts here, against people who sometimes are obviously evil and sometimes not.Eastwood not only starred but directed, and his direction shows him at a sort of tipping point between Sergio Leone and Eastwood's own later films. Gigantic close ups of wet faces and glistening teeth alternate with grandiose high shots of galloping horses. Eastwood's Josey Wales is his familiar Western figure, taciturn, slightly mean, given to spitting tobacco juice on dogs, full of provocative insults. Well? You gonna pull those guns or stand there whistlin' Dixie? When he tries to speak in ritualized and poetic English to the Comanches, while making a peace proposal, he fails. Perfumed speech is not his forte. And when he rides off into the sunset, it's without any suggestion of remorse for the hundred or so dead bodies he's left in his wake. Sandra Locke is a fetching young blond who sounds as if she'd just graduated from Vassar. Chief Dan George is fine in everything he does. One suspects he's not acting at all, just trying to get his lines right, but they come out the way they ought to. Paula Trueman, as Granny, is splendid.One thing I'm not sure the writers intended, but the movie is anti-Union in sentiment. Not pro-Confederate, just anti-Union. Nobody connected in even the most remote way with the United States Army is any good. At best, there are four harmless, doltish youths (whom Eastwood kills). At worst, they are treacherous creeps who line up Confederate prisoners at the surrender ceremony and mow them down with Gatling guns. In an amusing scene, Chief Dan George tells Eastwood how they screwed him out of his house and killed his family too. No mention of the Cherokees owning slaves, just like the plantation owners they learned from. No mention of slavery at all. The Civil War itself is economically reduced to a fuzzy montage of battling figures and an abundance of smoke. All these scenes I've mentioned are dark, cold, and uninviting. It's not an attractive movie.It's worth catching because it has a few good minutes in it, above and beyond the appeal of the traditional violent Western. But as he edged into his 70s and now his 80s, Eastwood's output was to become far more sophisticated, far more thoughtful, at times approaching art.

It's a big, mean killing machine, and it kills one of the members on the team and hitches a ride back to the States in his coffin, to a picturesque Southern California community.

Much of the humor is provided by John Goodman as the good-hearted local exterminator Delbert McClintlock, who's forced to bring out the big guns because the eco-friendly chemicals he's been using for years are no longer effective against this bigger and badder new breed of mutant, eight-legged freaks.

Yes, there are times when I laughed out loud but I chose this film because I was in the mood for a comedy. Had I been in the mood for a drama I am sure I would have scored the film much higher.East is East is the story of a Pakistani father, George Khan, his Caucasian British wife, Ella, and their seven children. The acting is superb, the writing is excellent, and the soundtrack is wonderful. Having said all of that, I do have a few issues with the film. (SPOILER ALERT) First, the oldest son, Nazir, just kind of disappears for a while without any explanation. Did he run away? Did he kill himself? Where did he go? We find out about halfway through the film when his father pronounces that he is dead. This leaves the viewer wondering how one could have missed such an important event, but a few minutes later we realize that Nazir is only dead to him. In fact, we discover, albeit something I guessed in the first ten minutes of the film, that Nazir is gay. This is all the more reason for his Pakistani father to call him dead.My second issue with the film is that I really liked all of the characters, even the strict and traditional George. Ella is charming the way she can talk him down from almost any argument with typical British humor mixed with a few choice swear words. The kids adore their mother and, although they disagree with him, they love their father. This led me to believe that the film was going to be a Dad is a strict traditional man, kids and mom are not, so this is the story of how everyone changes Dad. (SPOILER ALERT) Unfortunately, the story became, Dad is an abusive and closed-minded bastard and starts beating on anyone, including mom, who dares to defy him. I just don't understand why the story had to change this way. I left the film wishing Ella would leave her bastard husband and raise her kids on her own. We went from the tenderness of how Ella would ask George if he would like some tea and he would reply, just half a cup, to George calling her a bloody b**** and giving her a black eye. Why? My final issue with the film is the ending. (SPOILER ALERT) We are left with nothing changed in the family other than the children discovering that their father isn't just strict, he is cruel. I just feel incomplete after watching East is East. I get that the Pakistani culture is very different from British culture and that, particularly in the 1970's, the west was not very open to accepting this new group of immigrants. What else came of this story? I don't feel warm and fuzzy toward this culture if George is a shining of example of how the men truly behave. Why did he choose to marry outside of his own culture if he hates it so much? Why raise children with a mother who is not Muslim and not from Pakistan if you are just going to teach them that it is unacceptable to marry anyone who is not from Pakistan? I feel like I got a glimpse of a very dysfunctional family who will never see a happy ending and that is just not why I choose to watch films. I watch films to learn something new, or to laugh, to perhaps cry a little, but overall, I watch films to have a few hours of enjoyment. I watch films to forget my own problems for a while.

A film that you ALWAYS want to see whenever it is shown on cable or TV. You've just got to stop what you're doing to watch it. And MY COUSIN VINNY is that type of film. It's really one of those overlooked gems because it seems so small in stature and on the surface looks like a lightweight comedy, but in actuality it is a comic masterpiece! Coming out in 1992, and starring the great Joe Pesci, fresh off his Oscar-winning performance in GOODFELLAS (in 1990) and another impressive performance in the decade's best film JFK (in 1991), MY COUSIN VINNY was the completion of a trifecta of great films for Mr. Pesci. Up until this point, Pesci had been strictly a supporting actor. But finally in VINNY, he was allowed to carry a movie all his own, and carry it he did! Pesci is 100% absolutely memorable as newly-crowned lawyer Vincent LaGuardia Gambini (as classic a character name as you'll ever hear!). Vincent is tasked to defend 2 young men (his cousin Billy and friend Stan, played respectively by THE KARATE KID's Ralph Macchio and Mitchell Whitfield) falsely accused of armed robbery and murder in a sleepy Alabama town.MY COUSIN VINNY is a sublime comedy. It doesn't try to be laugh out loud and throw a bunch of zingers at you like most comedies, yet for much of this film, I find myself laughing out loud again and again! The story, the situation, the characters are what bring it to life. In addition to Pesci's brilliant performance, we the viewer are treated to some exceptional supporting work by Best Supporting Actress Marisa Tomei (as Vinny's hot, smart girlfriend Mona Lisa Vito), Fred Gwynne (Herman Munster himself!) as Judge Haller and Lane Smith as DA Trotter. A great cast! Also the minimal characters are hilarious as well.Pesci really deserves much of the credit. He plays the fish-out-of-water role to perfection here. Vincent Gambini, while new at law and very green about a lot of the law, makes up for his lack of book knowledge with an amazing array of street smarts, guts, guile, and confidence. He's just so likable. Tomei was ironically ridiculed for winning her Oscar here, but she is terrific as well, although I do think the rest of the supporting cast, especially Gwynne as the judge, is great as well. I find Gwynne and Pesci's pairing to be the best of the film.

The Disney people's art work is different, creative and innovative and making standards in animation films.Disfiguring a toy is a behavior we can see in many children. I don't know about any reasons why some kids like it. On any account, the film just eases that mind, encourages confidence even if you are just a 'toy', and coordinating as a team.

The Disney people's art work is different, creative and innovative and making standards in animation films.Disfiguring a toy is a behavior we can see in many children. I don't know about any reasons why some kids like it. On any account, the film just eases that mind, encourages confidence even if you are just a 'toy', and coordinating as a team. Randy Newman's music and songs are good. Tamil version's translations not exact but equally funny.It's a normal, good story still have eligibility for a classic.

Nowadays(25-01-2009) Jetix channel(India) airs this movie once in two months and dubbed in Tamil. I have seen the original English version many times and today this Tamil version. Felt both are equally good.The story. For kids. Toys of a boy Andy can all 'talk' i.e. they live like human beings. And there enters a new toy into Andy's life as his birthday present. The current favourite 'Woody' and the new entry have a struggle to win Andy's favourite toy position. Things happening in this struggle is the movie.This is definitely not an adult's movie.

It really showed the passions of all of the people in the movie. It showed that a single high school football team can change the minds of a town and what they think about each other. It taught us a good lesson on racism. Most people just think of movies as entertainment but Remember the Titans was so much more than that and people could really learn a lesson by watching this movie. I suggest that every person watch this at least once in their life because it changed the way I look at everybody. Each character in the movie really had an important part and I can't believe that this really happened in real life. It is a painful thing to think about how messed up our world is and how it is so full of hatred.

My only question is what was really going on between all the siblings? They only mentioned it all in passing which highly disappointed me because i wanted to know more. And what in the world did Dr. Doyle have to do with it all? That one i've still never been able to put my finger on. I felt the actors were all well placed and did an excellent job all around. They don't make movies like this anymore. I believe the scariest part is when he walks in the room and all you see is the girls feet at the piano.....FREAKED ME OUT! I've never been able to look at a piano the same again. Please watch if you haven't preferably on a cool rainy day all by your lonesome is the best way i think and watch it alone. Trust me, there will be goosebumps. ","genre":null},{"date":"25 January 2009","score":"","review":" I've had this movie since it was released and i adore it!

I loved him as I had no other, and his death shattered me into a million pieces. Like Conrad, I became withdrawn, felt as though no one could understand me, and could feel only pain and confusion inside of me. While Conrad remembered the boating accident in his nightmares I had the strangest nightmare of my father talking to me but with no sound coming out of his mouth. This nightmare continued on well into my adult life. When I saw Ordinary People for the first time it was like looking into my darkest corner, yet the beauty of the film healed me immeasurably. I am very grateful to Mr. Redford for his expertise in bringing this story to the screen. I am also indebted for life to Mr. Hutton for his masterful interpretation of Conrad. Every ounce of pain he acted in the film went through me and somehow helped me cope with my own pain. Though it has been 38 years since my father left me the pain is still inside my soul and at any moment can reappear and take over my mind and thoughts. However, because of the brilliance this film I can and do cope better. I will be indebted to Ordinary People for my entire life.
