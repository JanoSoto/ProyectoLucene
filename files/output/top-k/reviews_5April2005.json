I'm not going to say Scent of a woman is one of Pacino's best movies because he just has made too many great movies (The Godfather Trilogy, Dog Day Afternoon,...), but he certainly is brilliant! Pacino deserved the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role but it's a shame he had to wait such a long time to win his first Academy Award, it shouldn't be his only! I think he should definitely had won for Supporting Role for The Godfather and Leading Role for Dog Day Afternoon.I have seen Scent of a woman several times and I just can't say something bad about this movie. The story, based on the novel of the Italian writer Giovanni Arpino is excellent. You really see Frank Slade changing during the movie. If you compare the Frank Slade at the beginning of the movie with the one who gets out of the limo at the very end, you'll see he is a completely different person. In the beginning, Slade had planned the trip to New York as the last highlight of his miserable life. That's why he wanted to commit suicide in his hotel room.Because he was blind, he didn't felt alive anymore. He said it too The day we stop looking, is the day we die. Frank Slade had died a long time ago, inside he was already dead for a long time. But in New York, with Chris O'Donnel in his neighbourhood, he started feeling alive again. The ride with the Ferrari, the visit to the prostitute and of course...the wonderful tango with Gabrielle Anwar who gives a touching performance. All this makes Frank Slade start feeling alive again. Although he isn't able to see, he has noticed some light at the end of his blind tunnel.Touching story, amazing acting... All of this makes Scent of a woman a must see for everyone. Also the scene where the speech is given by Pacino at O'Donnel's school is breathtaking. Al Pacino gives the performance of he lifetime. I love De Niro but Pacino is definitely the best actor of his generation. **** out of **** ","genre":null},{"date":"5 April 2005","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Wonderful movie staring Al Pacino as Frank Slade.

It cleverly makes a point about the horror of war without having to go into gory detail. We often become desensitised to the effects of war - all we see is a newspaper headline or a 30 second news bulletin; this film goes some way to reveal the reality. But the movie is not just an intellectual exercise the black humour will make you chuckle and you'll also be gripped by the storyline.The film is based around two characters from opposing sides in the war who end up stuck in no mans land between the two warring factions. It creates a darkly comic situation of two enemy soldiers having to cooperate to get to safety. It's interesting to see that the characters are often unable to cooperate because of the blind nationalism and petty prejudices that armed conflicts create.I have only one criticism the second half of the film introduced numerous United Nations personnel and the media as additional characters (the UN trying to rescue the soldiers in no mans land, the media reporting on it), and frankly I thought the film was poorer for it. It simply tried to cover too much ground and too many issues and the attention on the main characters became diluted. Perhaps the scriptwriter wanted to make a point, but showing that the media are like vultures in a wartime scenario seems an obvious statement to me and none of the media characters were in the least bit interesting. Their appearance became a tedious distraction from the intrigue. In my view, a better approach would have been just to script the UN's role in this war and its methodology (something which may surprise many people) and just have the media as peripheral figures. It is for this reason that I have given the film 8\/10 rather than a higher rating.Overall, though, I can say that investing your time and money in watching this film is well worth it.

The amount of movies it has inspired is amazing - When Harry Met Sally (1989) probably being my favourite comparison.But with Annie Hall, there isn't really a comparison. It is the best romantic comedy ever. What was initially a three hour long film, called Anhedonia, was cut down to the succinct hour and half comedy we have with us today. The non-linear narrative really gives this film an edge on other comedies. It feels like memories of a relationship, being remembered in patches.Diana Keaton is great as the titular character, Annie Hall. Teeming with flaws, and quirkiness, Keaton creates a fully believable character - one that is enhanced even more by the appearance of Alvy Singer, Woody's character. Woody Allen is so funny in this movie, possibly Allen at his creative best. The jokes are intelligent, they move along well, and are - most importantly - varied. The subtitle scene, or where Alvy goes to Annie's house for dinner - and Grammy the Jew hater sees him - oh, it's just classic.I can't say any more than that. It really is funny - there are too many moments to mention. It is well acted, written and directed, with great pacing. If you are a Woody fan, I can't think of many comparisons to Annie Hall. Manhattan, another classic, is nothing like this movie, instead opting for a more melancholy mood. It isn't a period piece like the average Curse of the Jade Scorpion or the fantastic Purple Rose of Cairo. Annie Hall really is unique in his collection, with inventive jokes, the lively nature of the story and the way it involves the audience. Although people call this film romantic, it is actually quite the opposite at the end. Similar to Manhattan in that respect, but at least Annie Hall contained more laughs.You won't feel cold watching this movie. Go and get it now, it is fantastic cinema.

From the onset of the movie, with views of the snow covered North Dakota landscape and the beautiful and haunting music of composer Carter Burwell playing in the background until the very last scene, Fargo never lets up. This film is Joel and Ethan Cohen's masterpiece, a truly original and one of a kind work. Every aspect of the film is handled with the utmost precision and care. The screenplay, written by Joel and Ethan, is in my opinion flawless. The dialog is at times serious and at other times hilarious, but most importantly always real and believable. The screenplay would be worth nothing, however, without the superb cast of the film that truly makes the characters come to life. Frances McDormand is perfect as the pregnant sheriff who is assigned to the murder case involving Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare. Steve Buscemi is excellent as always, playing a sleazy kidnapper who is perfectly described in one of the best lines of the film as simply funny looking - in a general kind of way. The best performance, however, comes from William H. Macy who is absolutely brilliant as a desperate man who has everything to lose. Macy completely envelops himself in the role and captures perfectly the essence of a broken man whose world is crumbling all around him. The final scene in the motel when he is caught is incredibly powerful because Macy makes you feel the pain and sorrow that a man must feel when he knows that he's going to prison for the rest of his life.One of the things that I loved about this film is the colorful characters that are a trademark of every Cohen brothers film. In Fargo, these characters include dim witted hookers, psychopath kidnappers, a very pregnant sheriff, and a lot of snow. No matter how long or brief these characters are on the screen, however, they are all incredibly entertaining and fun to watch. That is one of the reasons that I enjoy films by the Cohen brothers. They have a great style and sense of humor that is all their own. They aren't afraid to be different from the Hollywood norm, and they make films on their own terms. Also, as evidenced by this film, they do a great job of getting the best out of every actor. I personally feel that William Macy and Frances McDormand have never been better before or since Fargo. I urge everyone to see this film and compare it to other great works of the last decade. I think you'll find that its place is right near the likes of Pulp Fiction, L.A.

Meanwhile these three villains want world domination so they use their powers for destruction. Those spacemen were doing nobody any harm. Terrence Stamp really brings Genaral Zod to life very well indeed. Why did true love get in the way of Superman when those 3 villains were on Planet Houston??? what planet is that? if General Zod did his homework correct he would of Found out that Planet Houston is in fact planet Earth! and we do not need him to rule over us!

Many people ridicule this film for its idealistic and often 'mushy' romance, and for the lovers' passionate relationship after being acquainted for no more than two days. Of course, perhaps 'Titanic' isn't the most believable story of all time, but in my eyes it's certainly one of the most entertaining. I don't watch movies to see reality, I see enough of that every day. If reality is what I had been hoping for when viewing 'Titanic', I would have been sorely disappointed in the love story (despite it's breathtakingly accurate portrayal of the ship's infamous death).No, 'Titanic' is more of a fairytale, one that sweeps you away and holds your attention until it's ending. It is the unforgettable tale of Jack, a poor but kind-hearted street urchin, and Rose, a wealthy but misunderstood young woman. When fate brings them together on the first and last voyage of the Titanic, they must face many trials and tribulations in order to pursue their forbidden love. Keeping them apart is Rose's mother, who insists that her daughter marry a stuck-up rich man, and Cal, Rose's malicious fiancé to whom she is to be wedded by force. While Jack and Rose are willing to face these odds for each other, there are some things which cannot be faced down, one of them being an iceberg, the ultimate destruction of their relationship.Despite its joyous fairytale like aspects, it is still very tragic. A feel-good romance and a tragic epic all in one, like a brilliant cross between 'Romeo and Juliet' and 'Cinderella'. For the first half of the movie I was overwhelmed with a wonderful feeling. For the second half I was near tears. Finally, the movie's amazing conclusion was sending chills down my spine, and I felt as if I couldn't decide if I was happy or sad.Leanardo DiCaprio is mischievous yet sweet-natured as Jack, and masterfully brings across what is, in my opinion, the most memorable and lovable role in the entire film. I found Kate Winslet almost, yet not quite, as impressive as DiCaprio in her role as Rose, who although seeming perfectly content and fortunate outwardly is misunderstood and desperately miserable inside. Jack sees this hidden part of her, recognizing her longing for freedom and helps her to fulfill it. The remaining cast shines as well.Watch this movie. Enjoy it.

The cast is brilliant, even if, strangely, some of them don't seem to get what the whole movie was about. You half expect that most of the cast and crew, like the kids who sign a petition to bring Big Fun to the school for a gig, made a movie they didn't know they were making.

Beyond that it's a gay fantasy, in which Lawrence gets to parade around in flowing robes, with a phallic dagger at his waist, exchanging soulful words and glances with Omar Sharif, accompanied by his adored young boys, and even get sodomized by a Turk. The gay man triumphs over the manly army types, so he's a double superman.Since this love can't speak its name it comes out in the unexplored, weirdly incoherent suggestions of inner conflict in Lawrence. He kills and says he likes it. Why? Who knows. The whole movie is a set of dots too far apart to connect. A few map shots might have helped understand the military situation, but all we get is names. That desert is too hot to cross, so they cross it. They trudge and trudge. Then they get there. The episodes, and the dialog, seem to float in the ether, without adequate context for understanding or emotional involvement. While Lean's camera caresses O'Tooles swishy sashaying, ice-blue eyes and golden hair, O'Toole emotes with a scenery-chewing extremity unseen since the silents. I think Valentino was more subtle. Alec Guinness contends for honors in the overacting contest, with his blue-eyed, over-enunciating sheik. Only Jack Hawkins gives a decently restrained performance.Jarre's music is jarring.

Either from poor production values, a dull story, a misplaced message or a whole load of other things. However, some films transcend that badness and become simply pointless, and The New Kid is one of those films. I'm not a massive fan of the teen comedy sub-genre, but unlike many cinema buffs; there are a handful that I like, this film not being one of them. It's amazing just how completely and utterly superfluous this film is and it's a wonder it ever got made. Of course, I'm sure money was a reason; but somehow I can't imagine that this picture was a huge hit at the box office. In fact, there are only two real reasons for watching this and neither of them are good ones. The first reason is to see just how stupid movies like this can be. Normally I would have turned this trash off after a few minutes, but I couldn't because I just had to see how much more stupid it could get. And I found out that the answer to that question is much more stupid. The second not very good, good reason to see this film is that Eliza Dushku is in it. She may well be very, very sexy...but she really needs a new agent! The plot is unlikely as anything you'll ever encounter, and it follows a geeky kid that moves schools and decides to become cool. So does. Before he knows it, he's got everyone in the school idolising him and not only that, but he's also got Eliza Dushku trying on bikini's for him! Yeah...right. Naturally, the film features the usual sorts of jokes, including the standard midget and the hard kid that gets his comeuppance. This movie also features a number of very painful movie tributes, for films such as The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, Patton and Braveheart. What really got me about the choices of films to tribute was that this movie's target audience most probably wouldn't have seen them, so it's just a completely wasted joke. Not to mention an excruciating one. The weird looking kid from Roadtrip takes the lead role and does his usual thing. It must be frustrating for an actor to be typecast, especially when you're being typecast as a nerdy kid. Oh well. On the whole, if you've got absolutely nothing else to do (like I didn't), see this movie. Otherwise; you have no reason to bother.

Jude Law, probably in his best performance is a modern day vampire. Naturally, this being a modern movie which tries to be original, Law's character has few of the vampire traits we would recognise; he can live in daylight, crucifixes etc hold no power over him, he cannot transform into other animals, and does not have fangs. However, he is semi-immortal, and must drink human blood to survive. Indeed it is this which lies behind the story, and it is a tragedy rather than a horror. With great acting, beautiful and subtle camera-work, a touching story and a good soundtrack, The Wisdom of Crocodiles bears all the markings of a good movie. It is; unfortunately it is little known, and of course has flaws which probably stopped it from becoming an instant hit.Law is Stephen, an attractive, clever, charming young man who happens to be a vampire. In his quest for the 'perfect' woman who can save him from his torturous life, a strong woman with the ability to love him, literally changing her blood. All the women he has found in the past have been scared of him, so he has killed them. When he does this, he takes a fang like object from them. In his desperate search for love he finds Anna, (Lowensohn) a beautiful young woman and they begin to fall for each other. She is enchanted by him, but sher is also cautious, and when he saves her from a gang of muggers she becomes scared. The truth soon comes out in parts, and all the time the police are interested in Stephen's involvement in the death of his ex-girlfriend. The story builds to a suitable emotional climax, and never at any point can we predict what will happen.The film failed at the box-office because it is very downbeat, and only features one big name star. The director is also little known, but he shows an immense talent here, and gets the best from the cast. Hoffman's script has some of the best dialogue in years, but is also clever and full of metaphor and depth. It is definitely a film crying out to be rewatched as you will find something new with each viewing. The film is filled with imagery to suit the script, and Law's charismatic performance could not have been bettered. Lowensohn is also very good, her intensity growing as she finds out more about Stephen. Of course, as a vampire movie people will expect blood and scares. Here there is little blood shed and few scenes of violence, though all are handled perfectly, and of course it is not that kind of film. Hopefully a DVD release in the UK will be forthcoming. The cop storyline adds another depth, but for some the proceedings will be too slow. The film has its own pace, and rarely gets out of first gear, but this is the way it should be.

In his quest for the 'perfect' woman who can save him from his torturous life, a strong woman with the ability to love him, literally changing her blood. All the women he has found in the past have been scared of him, so he has killed them. When he does this, he takes a fang like object from them. In his desperate search for love he finds Anna, (Lowensohn) a beautiful young woman and they begin to fall for each other. She is enchanted by him, but sher is also cautious, and when he saves her from a gang of muggers she becomes scared. The truth soon comes out in parts, and all the time the police are interested in Stephen's involvement in the death of his ex-girlfriend. The story builds to a suitable emotional climax, and never at any point can we predict what will happen.The film failed at the box-office because it is very downbeat, and only features one big name star. The director is also little known, but he shows an immense talent here, and gets the best from the cast. Hoffman's script has some of the best dialogue in years, but is also clever and full of metaphor and depth. It is definitely a film crying out to be rewatched as you will find something new with each viewing. The film is filled with imagery to suit the script, and Law's charismatic performance could not have been bettered. Lowensohn is also very good, her intensity growing as she finds out more about Stephen. Of course, as a vampire movie people will expect blood and scares. Here there is little blood shed and few scenes of violence, though all are handled perfectly, and of course it is not that kind of film. Hopefully a DVD release in the UK will be forthcoming. The cop storyline adds another depth, but for some the proceedings will be too slow. The film has its own pace, and rarely gets out of first gear, but this is the way it should be. An underrated film, but as Jude Law's stardom rises hopefully he will not forget this, and his fans will discover it.8 out of 10 ","genre":"Crime, Mystery, Romance"}]
