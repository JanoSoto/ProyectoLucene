(I've reviewed all of them). In this story, Clint Eastwood sets out to kill two men who slashed up a woman, with his friends Morgan Freeman and the Kid. Also receiving their names on the box are Gene Hackman, the bipolar sheriff and Richard Harris, a British patriot.A lot of this film is great. The script is tight and the stories are masterfully interwoven, the music fits the bill, and the acting is very good across the board. On paper, this is an absolute masterpiece of a film.A major success of Unforgiven is its characters. Will, the 'protaganist', is a retired gunslinger, and he reminds everyone of that throughout the film. He's also given up drinking, because of his deceased wife's memory. He needs money for his kids, and since pigs can't cut it, he picks up his guns to catch a bounty.Morgan Freeman is his friend, also a retired gunslinger. He has handled dealing with the past much better, as he is calm and content. However I didn't like Freeman's character, Ned. We never found out much about his past, so we don't really care about him. Ned simply isn't the kind of character Freeman should play. It seems he was only there for star billing.And speaking of star billing, Richard Harris. He plays a 'killer', and a very proud Brit, a true nationalist. He is EXCELLENT. Which is why it's a shame and a waste that he arrive 40 minutes into the movie, and leaves as Clint and Morgan show up. Yet, he receives star billing, his picture on the front of the box, and a write-up on the back. Silly.The Kid is unlikable. If he were alive today, he'd be a textbook redneck. But we find out his faults, and the truth, and in the end I liked his act.Lastly, the sheriff. Two-Face himself. I'm not sure of the direction that was taken with Little Bill. He is nice, jolly, brutal and cruel throughout the movie. Is he a bad guy? Or Clint's adversary? Or are we supposed to like his justice, which is his job? It's very grey.My main issue is the ending, so spoilers be here. It's simply wrong, what they did with Will Munny. We see his descent into his old ways, but for it to end like that is sickening. He extracts revenge on Bill, which is fine for him to do in my opinion because of how he treated Ned. Munny then has to kill every other armed man in the bar. But the real kick is when he drinks at the bar. He's returned to his old self, and threatens to kill everyone unless proper treatment was given to Ned. But maybe he could've dealt with that himself? Then to top it off, we're given the sad music and told he's moved. How can we find that ending satisfying? A better ending, Scarface style, would involve Will killing the second slasher, being informed of Ned's fate, killing everyone in a rage with the Kid watching, and then the Kid shooting Will to end his wickedness, and have a first kill that had a justified purpose.One other issue the movie is really dark. At night, the screen is almost entirely black. I've never had this problem with any other movie.Technically, Unforgiven is a great film with solid characters and messages to ponder. Unfortunately, a bungled ending leaves a very sour taste in your mouth.

But this is what musicals should all be about; simply have a good time watching it and let it be a feast for your eyes and ears.The entire movie does feel and look very stagy but in this case that really isn't a complaint. It simply suits the movie well and makes it part of the reason why this is such perfect light entertainment to watch. Besides, it is a good looking movie as well, with all of its grand sets and nice costume design.But what is a musical without any good music. And luckily this movie does really has some good and pleasant songs in it, performed nicely by its cast, though not always its original cast. Audrey Hepburn still got dubbed for instance, which was also really apparent in some of the songs. Rex Harrison on the other hand does all of the singing himself and his style of singing and acting fits the character and songs very well.Yes, all of the acting in general is very impressive in this movie as well. I had seen Rex Harrison in a couple of movies before but he never impressed me as much as he did with his role in this movie. Also Audrey Hepburn surprised me. I have always loved her but I never realized how incredible versatile as an actress she actually was until I saw her in this movie. She basically plays two different characters in this. She is both very convincing as the foul mounted girl from the streets and as the sophisticated, uppercases lady. You probably won't even recognize her at first, until she slowly starts to transform into the lovely beautiful young woman, we also all remember Audrey Hepburn as.The story and characters within this movie are definitely not all without its flaws but in this case all the story wanted was to deliver a simple, light and enjoyable movie for everybody of all ages, sexes and ethnicities to enjoy. And I think they most definitely did not fail with this.At least the Academy Awards also agree with me, since the movie received 8 Oscar's, including the most important ones for best director and best picture of the year.

And I think they most definitely did not fail with this.At least the Academy Awards also agree with me, since the movie received 8 Oscar's, including the most important ones for best director and best picture of the year. It also eventually would turn out to be the only Oscar legendary director George Cukor received.

","genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"11 June 2011","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Santa Fe Trail, an epic western from Warner Brothers' golden era, is high-powered, fast paced, action-packed entertainment. Not the standard western story line or time setting, it takes place in the years immediately preceding the War Between the States. The action is not the usual cavalry versus Inidians or law versus outlaws, but the Army fighting against John Brown's depredations in bleeding Kansas. This first class A production put first-rate director Micheal Curtiz in charge of a cast topped by Errol Flynn, Ronald Regan, Olivia De Havilland, Raymond Massey (as John Brown), and Van Hefflin in a villainous role, along with Warner's terrific stable of supporting players, and hundreds of extras. Flynn is at his best here as gallant Army officer Jeb Stuart, and the trim Mexican War era uniform compliments his dashing image. Massey is overpowering and absolutely riveting as half-mad, fanatical abolitionist leader Brown. Miss De Havilland doesn't have one of her better parts as the love interest of both Flynn and Regan, but she makes the best of it and comes off both fetching and engaging. Regan is solid and likable in a second banana role. Flynn's two favorite sidekicks (and real-life drinking buddies), those crude but lovable buffoons Alan Hale and Guinn Big Boy Williams lead the supporting cast, which also includes Moroni Olsen (as Robert E. Lee), Henry O'Neill, and the ever-reliable John Litel. Acting is first rate from top to bottom.Santa Fe Trail is almost non-stop action from beginning to end, all of it well staged, well filmed, and driven along by a rousing Max Steiner score. This movie has so much kinetic energy, it reminded me of a silent picture at times. The night gunfight in and around the burning barn at Palmyra, which eventually turns into a full-scale pitched battle between the cavalry and the Brownites, is one of the most spectacular and exciting action sequences ever staged in a movie. Yet the script by Robert Buckner is intelligent with sharp and engaging dialog. The final battle with Brown's forces at the Harpers Ferry Arsenal is staged on an epic scale. In both this scene and the one at Palmyra it seems more like a war movie than a western.Santa Fe Trail is top-notch entertainment in every way. Unfortunately the picture has come under a barrage of unfair criticism from two of the most irritating creatures who lurk about IMDb -- the self-appointed history professor and the politically correct gestapo enforcer. The professors of course are right in saying the movie plays fast and loose with history. But who cares! This is a work of fiction, **based** on actual events but not bound to portray them with circumspect accuracy. When the facts get in the way of the story, the story comes first. Only the most naive and uneducated expect a movie to give accurate history. You have to go to one of those old artifacts of the pre-electronic age, a book, to get the facts. Santa Fe Trail does, however, give an excellent impressionistic view of the events and attitudes leading up to the Civil War. It should set off a looking-up binge for the curious. I recall when first seeing the picture about fifty years ago, I did a lot of looking up. I didn't expect to find Jeb Stuart and Custer in the same West Point class. I already knew enough to know that Custer was much younger. But I was pleasantly surprised to find Robert E. Lee and Jeb Stuart were in fact at the siege at Harpers Ferry. By the way some of the professors erred in complaining that lever action rifles were used -- meaning repeating rifles, which would be incorrect for the time period. The rifles used in Santa Fe Trail were Sharps single shot breech loaders, which employed an under lever to open and close the breech for reloading -- in wide use during the 1850's. Not everything was inaccurate!The politically correct thought-control police have labeled Santa Fe Trail racist simply because it tries to show both sides of the issue and because it portrays Brown as an unbalanced murderer, which no serious history denies, rather than the hero they horrifyingly think he was. They have been joined by the rabidly Southerner-hating Yankees who come out of the woodwork to comment on any Civil War era movie. In fact this movie takes no side. The movie studios of the Golden Era had no agenda, except entertaining people and making stacks of money doing it, which Santa Fe Trail delivered on both accounts.

Not the standard western story line or time setting, it takes place in the years immediately preceding the War Between the States. The action is not the usual cavalry versus Inidians or law versus outlaws, but the Army fighting against John Brown's depredations in bleeding Kansas. This first class A production put first-rate director Micheal Curtiz in charge of a cast topped by Errol Flynn, Ronald Regan, Olivia De Havilland, Raymond Massey (as John Brown), and Van Hefflin in a villainous role, along with Warner's terrific stable of supporting players, and hundreds of extras. Flynn is at his best here as gallant Army officer Jeb Stuart, and the trim Mexican War era uniform compliments his dashing image. Massey is overpowering and absolutely riveting as half-mad, fanatical abolitionist leader Brown. Miss De Havilland doesn't have one of her better parts as the love interest of both Flynn and Regan, but she makes the best of it and comes off both fetching and engaging. Regan is solid and likable in a second banana role. Flynn's two favorite sidekicks (and real-life drinking buddies), those crude but lovable buffoons Alan Hale and Guinn Big Boy Williams lead the supporting cast, which also includes Moroni Olsen (as Robert E. Lee), Henry O'Neill, and the ever-reliable John Litel. Acting is first rate from top to bottom.Santa Fe Trail is almost non-stop action from beginning to end, all of it well staged, well filmed, and driven along by a rousing Max Steiner score. This movie has so much kinetic energy, it reminded me of a silent picture at times. The night gunfight in and around the burning barn at Palmyra, which eventually turns into a full-scale pitched battle between the cavalry and the Brownites, is one of the most spectacular and exciting action sequences ever staged in a movie. Yet the script by Robert Buckner is intelligent with sharp and engaging dialog. The final battle with Brown's forces at the Harpers Ferry Arsenal is staged on an epic scale. In both this scene and the one at Palmyra it seems more like a war movie than a western.Santa Fe Trail is top-notch entertainment in every way. Unfortunately the picture has come under a barrage of unfair criticism from two of the most irritating creatures who lurk about IMDb -- the self-appointed history professor and the politically correct gestapo enforcer. The professors of course are right in saying the movie plays fast and loose with history. But who cares! This is a work of fiction, **based** on actual events but not bound to portray them with circumspect accuracy. When the facts get in the way of the story, the story comes first. Only the most naive and uneducated expect a movie to give accurate history. You have to go to one of those old artifacts of the pre-electronic age, a book, to get the facts. Santa Fe Trail does, however, give an excellent impressionistic view of the events and attitudes leading up to the Civil War. It should set off a looking-up binge for the curious. I recall when first seeing the picture about fifty years ago, I did a lot of looking up. I didn't expect to find Jeb Stuart and Custer in the same West Point class. I already knew enough to know that Custer was much younger. But I was pleasantly surprised to find Robert E. Lee and Jeb Stuart were in fact at the siege at Harpers Ferry. By the way some of the professors erred in complaining that lever action rifles were used -- meaning repeating rifles, which would be incorrect for the time period. The rifles used in Santa Fe Trail were Sharps single shot breech loaders, which employed an under lever to open and close the breech for reloading -- in wide use during the 1850's. Not everything was inaccurate!The politically correct thought-control police have labeled Santa Fe Trail racist simply because it tries to show both sides of the issue and because it portrays Brown as an unbalanced murderer, which no serious history denies, rather than the hero they horrifyingly think he was. They have been joined by the rabidly Southerner-hating Yankees who come out of the woodwork to comment on any Civil War era movie. In fact this movie takes no side. The movie studios of the Golden Era had no agenda, except entertaining people and making stacks of money doing it, which Santa Fe Trail delivered on both accounts.

As a DJ for the Armed Forces Radio Service he brought a breath of fresh air and comedy to a very dismal situation. He had quite an impact upon the morale of the enlisted men, but was disliked intensely by Second Lieutenant Steven Hauk played by Bruno Kirby and Sergeant Major Dickerson played by J.T. Walsh. They felt he was severely irreverent. Many films have been made concerning Vietnam such as Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket, to name just a few, and they all touch upon the theme concerning the rigors, sadness and horrors of war. This film's twist was to bring a touch of comedy to the misery of the war itself, much like the show M*A*S*H attempted to do. Adrian repeatedly raised the ire of the two officers by doing skits where he would change his voice to famous people and conduct phony interviews with them, make sound effects, and play music they considered wrong. In his own way he stated his opinions and versions on issues of the world. One of the many things that angered Adrian was that he couldn't present many news articles, nor always tell the full news stories. He felt they were masking reality from the enlisted men. He made you laugh but between the lines, you felt his sarcasm, frustration, and mockery of things going on. When he did disobey and enlightened everyone to the bombing at Jimmy Wan's he was pulled off the air. This gave Lieutenant Hauk a chance to shine as the DJ which he didn't.

Thanks to Garlick stopping on the road as troops were about to go into battle, Adrian was pressed into an impromptu show.

One of the saddest parts of the movie is when Adrian realized that Traun, who he considered a good friend, was in actuality a VC operative. It hurt him to know that Traun was behind the bombing of the G.I. bar. Because of this revelation and friendship, Dickerson is overjoyed to be able to give Adrian an honorable discharge. Even at the end of the movie, Adrian's character is revealed. He stops on the way to the airport, to set up a softball game with the members from his English class.

Dad is too wrapped up in his crumbling business to take notice of his son's drift. School are over-worked and for them Howie will be one of many who slips through the safety net. As bad goes to worse, someone has to step into the void to be a crutch for Howie. This opens the door for Big John, a local made man and a predator on young boys. Like so many other kids, a lack of supervision exposes Howie to exploitation.That storyline never quite realises its potential in this bitty, at times infuriating story. Too many contradictions and narrative dead-ends present themselves. Howie's friend Gary is a very disturbed boy from the wrong side of the tracks. He envies Howie's middle class lifestyle, and Howie is too wrapped up in himself to see it. Except when push comes to shove, Howie finds it in himself to break into Gary's place and steal some guns. It makes for some nice visual inter-cutting (by virtue of the fact that Gary is simultaneously breaking into Howie's home), but in terms of character consistency makes no sense. Big John is a very sinister, very dangerous man, who preys on the young and vulnerable. And yet something about Howie ignites a noble streak in him, so that any sense of threat by Big John is quickly marked absent, and we are asked to believe that Howie's plight has brought out BJ's good side. Except that BJ is sick, and Howie is hardly credible as the cure.Howie is supposed to be confused and vulnerable, but quotes Walt Whitman in a confident and articulate style that belies his 15 years. At this point we see Paul Dano, trained actor, rather than the character he is playing.What was this film trying to say? That we are all shades of grey? Sh*t happens?

He doesn't want to struggle like his father Carl Fox (Martin Sheen), who works as a mechanic for an airline company. He learns from his father that Blue Star, the company his father works for, is about to get a favorable ruling on a crash that happened the previous year. After Bud's persistence pays off, he finally gets a chance to sell Gordon Gekko on some stocks. After Gordon doesn't bite on Bud's first choices, he drops the name Blue Star, and informs Gordon of the insider tip he heard from his father. Bud finally gets his shots and works closely with Gordon, trying to get any kind of insider information on other companies. Living the good life, fast money and unethical business deals, Bud finally learns about Gordon's plan to break up Blue Star and rip off the employees retirement fund. Bud sets Gordon up by finding another buyer and after plotting with the employees and his contacts to dump their stocks, which ends up costing Gordon millions of dollars. In turn Bud is arrested for insider trading, but part of his plea deal he must set up Gordon yet again. And so, Gordon meets Bud in Central Park and Gordon tells Bud about some other illegal dealings he has made. Unbeknownst to Gordon, Bud was wearing a wire. This movie closely resembles the theme from the movie Greedy (1994), starring Michael J. Fox. When it comes to money, you never know whom your real friends are until that money runs out. By using sound effects and invisible sound Wall Street is able to portray an almost three- dimensional felling. The opening credits depict the hustle and bustle of New York City.

In the offices, you hear everyone talking at once, typing away on computer screens, noises beeping and buzzing. All these sounds depict the fast pace life in New York City to give you a feeling of how hectic it must be to live in work in such a place, everyone is in a hurry, because after all time is money. It gave me the feeling of being small in relationship to the world. Dramatic arrangement of people and objects is another technique employed by Oliver Stone in this movie.

They're a couple in love, but Steve intends to get out of the small town they're living in by going away to college, and Lori is distressed about their future together. This is perhaps the most average portion of the movie.The second situation is just pure hilarity, as the geek known as Terry the Toad (Charles Martin Smith - in a really likable performance) manages to pick up a pretty blonde who looks like Sandra Dee (Candy Clark). Together they get into all sorts of predicaments while trying to buy booze, and getting their car stolen.The third scenario features a macho-guy car racer named John Milner (Paul Le Mat, years before Fonzie), who gets stuck having to cruise the strip in his souped-up dragster with the accompaniment of a 12-year-old girl (Mackenzie Phillips). Le Mat and Phillips really have a good chemistry together, and go through some humorous and heartening situations.

Dreyfuss finds himself smitten by a mysterious and unattainable blonde goddess who frequently drives by him in a white T-bird (Suzanne Somers), and also unwittingly finds himself stumbling onto the turf of a tough gang called The Pharoahs, who insist on forcing him to join their group.The ending of the film drives home the point of how these were the last days of carefree innocence.

In the space of a few years we saw 'The Fugitive' 'Mission Impossible', 'The Avengers', 'Maverick', 'The Beverly Hillbillies', and 'The Addams Family'. Some proved entertaining, but most fell flat, often because the makers had no understanding of what made the originals work in the first place. Barry Sonnenfeld's follow-up to his successful 'Men In Black' reunited him with its star - Will Smith - for an adaptation of Michael Garrison's Western cum spy show 'The Wild Wild West'. Smith is an amiable enough performer, but lacks the charisma necessary for the role of 'James West' ( which Robert Conrad had in spades ). Bruce Campbell would have been better in my view. Kevin Kline provides some laughs as his partner 'Artemus Gordon'. The story has West and Gordon meeting for the first time whilst investigating the disappearances of noted scientists, among them the father of sexy Rita Escobar ( Salma Hayek ). Their rivalry ends when they work together on the orders of President Ulysses S.Grant. The trail leads to crippled mad scientist Dr.Arliss Loveless ( Kenneth Branagh ) who is constructing a giant mechanical spider to kill the President and take over the country.I am staggered at the vitriol this has attracted ( most of the reviews look like the work of one very angry person ). Did I see the same film as everyone else? There is a lot to like about it - Elmer 'The Magnificent Seven' Bernstein provides a cracking soundtrack ( one of his last ), the gadgets are cool, the action fast, the girls - particularly Hayek, who has a nice arse - are hot, and the spider itself a magnificent creation, almost like something out of Jules Verne. Its certainly more fun than the last James Bond film - the horrid 'Quantum Of Solace'. Some nice touches of humour such as the dog peering into an ear trumpet, inadvertently recreating the 'His Master's Voice' ( better known these days as 'H.M.V.' ) logo. The unexpected use of the original theme tune as West and Gordon gallop off to to find Loveless is a rousing moment.Where it goes wrong is the casting.

Terror of Mechagodzilla was to be the last Godzilla film for a while, but there were actually a couple of proposals between it and Return of Godzilla. Godzilla vs Gargantua was proposed for 1978 but never happened, and Godzilla vs Asuka Fortress was to be for 1979. I think Toho made the right decision. If nothing else, it certainly created quite a build up for this film in 1984 (or 1985 for us Americans).If you disliked the campy and more child-friendly Godzilla flicks that had succeeded the dark original, you'll appreciate Return of Godzilla greatly. The dark, somber theme coincides with a much more menacing, far less campy Godzilla. Godzilla is bigger and looks ferocious. His atomic ray (along with other special effects) have been upgraded considerably, although there are still the oft-mentioned quirks with the mechanical head and other here-and-there's. The earlier part of the film with the Shockirus, a mutated louse that feeds on people by sucking them dry, adds a jumpy scene or two and tells the audience right away that this isn't your kid-friendly Godzilla's Revenge movie.The plot is also fairly topical, something that couldn't be said for a lot of Godzilla movies. No goofy looking aliens, no underground communities, but we do have the Cold War and Russian-American tensions. The only somewhat larger flaw I found with the American version as compared to the Japanese version was the cut explanation for the Shockirus. I suspect it would have been nice to have that scene, but you can't have everything.Toho did a pretty good job, both in the movie and in returning Godzilla to his roots. They continued this excellence with the film's sequel five years later, 1989's Godzilla vs Biollante.

The dragons, demons and villains much in need of slaying are bikers, crooked cops and pursuit helicopters.Always an artist with a rare nerve for taking a risk, Eastwood experiments here with a movie that takes the cop action\/drama genre and cross breeds it with an urban fairy tale of fantastical proportions. Intended essentially as a piece of slick entertainment rather than a gritty, realistic message movie to be taken seriously, The Gauntlet just about works it's mojo on the level it is pitched at.Obviously, no one could realistically survive the sustained hail of bullets that Eastwood and Locke do throughout it's running time and no law enforcement agency in the civilised world would be allowed to dispense such apocalyptic firestorms at just two people.If you accept that this film is, at its core, a shadowy cop fantasy flick rather than a neo-realistic expose of, say, police corruption, then you may get a fair deal of enjoyment out of it. If you can't, then you probably won't.Admittedly, it isn't the most satisfactory of Clint's efforts, it has to be said, yet definitely worth a look for the fans and those willing to suspend disbelief. Quite a lot of disbelief.
