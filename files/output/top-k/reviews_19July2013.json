The Controlling Idea, that brotherhood is worth dying for, is well told and thematically supported. The contradictory notion of risking the lives of many to save the few resonates well with the idea of war in general that the values of freedom, family and human rights are ideals worth dying for even if these values are preserved only for a few survivors. The hope is the survivors (and the viewers) can go on to live a good life and treasure their freedoms that others died to protect. The question is that in a democracy where human rights and freedoms are valued, why would anyone in their right mind choose to sacrifice their life and limb? The answer these soldiers choose to do it to protect a brother, and these armies choose to do it to protect the basic human rights of the citizens of fellow nations. This seems to suggest that the very fabric of democratic society rests on the fundamental respect for each other and the rights of others and that these rights and freedoms are ideals that much be protected to the death.Great film told with what I count to be three major external plots to save Ryan, to win the war and to save the lives of the men. The lives of the men are lost to achieve the first two. Thus proving the Controlling Idea that brotherhood is worth dying for.My major complaint is the film is too long. Three hours is a long time and the episodes of peace are not so interesting since not much relationship or personal development takes place. The brothers are good from beginning to end and their relationships are good from beginning to end. Of course there are minor plot lines like Opum's compassion for POWs and Reiben's questioning of Miller's judgement. But they don't create serious turning points in an otherwise external-action focused story. I think the story would look substantially the same if you cut out the middle the Carparso dying to save a French child, the radar assault that loses Wade and the church resting.My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca ","genre":null},{"date":"19 July 2013","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Saving Private Ryan is about a band of brothers who give up their own lives to save the life of a single soldier in the chaos of war.

Sally Field is Celeste Talbert, a daytime diva of Susan Lucci proportions that actually has an Emmy (or four) and comes off closer to Erika Slezak's One Life to Live character as the queen of misery as daytime network head Gary Marshall describes her as. She's as melodramatic off the set as she is on, and when a former leading man (Kevin Kline) returns to the show, she's ripe for ripping as secrets from her past prepare to turn her own world upside down, turning off her guiding light as she moves into her own edge of night.She's surrounded by a series of wacko characters-producer Robert Downey Jr., his friend with benefits and jealous supporting player Cathy Moriarty (who has secrets of her own, revealed through her hatred of practically everybody around her), sardonic writer Whoopie Goldberg, and nervous costume designer Kathy Najimy who creates outrageous hats for the cast that threaten to make Celeste look like Gloria F'in Swanson! and new cast member Elizabeth Shue resemble Tweetie Bird.You have to go into this film realizing that this soap opera parody isn't necessarily reflective of early 1990's soap opera. The sets are too glamorous for most soaps of this time (at the time, only The Bold and the Beautiful and Santa Barbara were really close to as lavish as this was) and some of the plot lines even inside the soaps reek of dialog far worse than anything heard on daytime. But to watch it for Field's tour-de-force performance (she parodies her infamous Oscar speech as Celeste picks up her umpteenth daytime Emmy) is to find delight in seeing Field out of her usual comfort zone set with her more dramatic films. Even her early sitcom appearances were far from outrageous, and she proves herself to be a good sport as she hams it up deliciously.Second to Field in overall performance is Moriarty, perfectly cast as an Amazon-like woman whose frizzed hair and overly short nurses' uniform are only overshadowed by her Elaine Stritch like raspy voice. Moriarty is obviously an actress who decided that with her bigger-than-life qualities in real life, she'd never make it as an ingénue, and just went all out to camp up. Kline, too, is very funny, screaming Don't call me Mr. Loman! when his Florida dinner theater performance of Death of a Salesman is preparing for its curtain rise for its Geritol-guzzling audience. This is a film meant mainly for fun, not only for soap fans, but for those who just simply want to laugh at the ridiculousness of the drama of life and see their own problems in perspective.

Since everyone is up to no good, the only rational way to keep our attention is to up the ante on how bad the characters become and how cool they when they are being bad.So a film whose central idea is about the inevitable downfall of crime betrays its central idea by making the characters cool and full of attitude and glorifying them. Seriously why do we need a movie like this? It seems to just perpetuate all the negative stereotypes about movies glorifying violence and bad characters.My second beef is in general about Martin Scorsese.

The main external plot, the slave rebellion, falls to a failure.

Spartacus has no arc he is a rebellious slave from beginning to end. Sure his rebellious nature gains greater purpose as he seeks to bring freedom to all the slaves, but that is established in Act 1 (the first hour). So for the next two Acts (the next two hours), the story's energy is sapped and stalled every second we spend watching Spartacus alone building his army, getting a wife, building a bigger army, the slaves getting along harmoniusly, Spartacus and the slaves dancing in the sunset etc... These scenes are a complete waste of time since it doesn't come with any turning point on any plot. Maybe audiences in the 60s expect these filler moments to go to the bathroom during this 3 hour marathon, or maybe the female lead demanded Kubrick shoot her with fuzzy focus to make her look good and had a contractual limit on the amount of screen time she got, but it does no service to the story. With these scenes cut you can probably have a powerful film in a compact 90 minutes.Tangential thoughts below...My theory is since the story was produced by and starred Kirk Douglas, who brought Kubrick in after a disagreement with the previous director (see wikipedia), maybe the actor had too much say in the storytelling. So much so that the director and editor couldn't leave the boring bits on the cutting room floor. Or maybe the producers wouldn't let army marching scenes be cut since they paid so much money for so many extras to fill the screen. Reminds me of the big boring fight at the end of the first Pirates of the Caribbean that ruined a great movie no way the producers would shorten those scenes after millions were already spent on the computer graphics. Maybe that's why the Pixar films are so great and tightly cut its all computer graphics anyway and they all cost the same amount of money to render so cut away. So this leads me to think its a good thing for Director's to have final cut. But then again, a lot of these extended director's cut versions basically put a lot of boring filler back in.

It was a film that became known for making Christopher Lambert a star, showed Sean Connery in a mentor role and had a soundtrack supplied by Queen. But it is a film that has not aged as well some people have hoped.Conner Macleod (Lambert) is the Highlander in question, an immortal man who was born in 16th Century Scotland. He has lived for centuries, leading him to New York in 1985. The immortals are few in number, they can only be killed by beheading and when there is only one left they will gain the prize. By 1985 there are only two immortals left, Macleod and a brutal warrior known as The Krugan (Clancy Brown), an immortal who can spell doom for humanity if he wins the Prize.Highlander tells it story in flashbacks about Macleod's life, mainly in Scotland as he coached by Ramierz (Connery), a 2000-year-old Egyptian immortal pretending to be Spanish as well as focus on his relationship with his wife, Heather (Beatie Edney). The other side of the story is in contemporary New York where the police investigating the beheading, a forensics officer, Brenda Wyatt (Roxanne Hart) with knowledge about swords tries to find out who a man called Russell Nash (Lambert) really is and The Krugan who is on the search for Macleod. The flashbacks were clear in its objective, set up the rules of the world and follows Macleod and his loved ones. But the modern half of the story is much little focused with much of it on the police investigation whose affects are damped because of the flashbacks. There are moments that could easily have been cut, like a scene where Macleod meets another immortal which was just a quick fleeting scene and the character gets killed very quickly and many of the sequences with the police could have been changed to a media reaction.The director Russell Mulcahy came from a music video background and it shows with his very stylised approach. He has a tendency to use low shots, tracking shots and there was plenty of smoke and fog effects. New York was a dark, grim city and the film has a continuous moody look, from the backalleys to the industrial sites. When we see the battle in the Highlands looked very much like a music video, particularly with the Krugan dressed in a skull. The transitions to the flashbacks are done with tricks like pans, such as from a fish tank to a loch and the screen smashing like glass to go back to World War II.For an action film, Highlander is disappointing. The sword fighting is very slow and cumbersome for the most part and some parts were very cheesy, like the first fight where rival fighter does backflips and acrobatics. The best sequence was the very final fight sequence where the fight was shot mostly with wide shots and the action was more fluid. Cinematographer Gerry Fisher was very strong at showing the moody cityscape to beauty of the isolated mountains of the Scottish Highlands.When Lambert was cast he had very limited English and it was made more bizarre that he was playing a Scottish character and a Scottish actor was playing a non-Scot character. In the trivia section it stated that Lambert worked with a vocal coach to give Macleod a non-specific accent, but his natural French accent was prominent. But Lambert did on occasion have a good delivery with some of his lines. Brown too was okay as the villain, having a distinctive voice and he certainly looked like a psychopath.Queen supplied the soundtrack and that is always a bonus, giving us song like Who Wants to Live Forever and Princes of the Universe. There is a particularly nice moment in the score when uses Who Wants to Live Forever in love scene.The 1980s has produced better films an better actioners.

It is the story of a very special sword from very ancient China, a sword that carries fate and destiny in it for the person who controls it, because it is not enough to own it, you must control it and when you control it, it controls you. That sword is stolen and tamed by a young woman who is to marry some nobleman though long before she was both abducted and saved by a wild young man roaming in the mountains and distant deserts, far from everything. They fell in love after much fighting.When her marriage arrives, the young man comes to Beijing to claim the young woman but that is impossible because her father is the governor. So he manages to escape and she decides to steal the sword and to go after him. The story becomes complicated then and yet very simple. She is in love with a middle-age woman she calls her sister and who was the owner of the sword. Hence a rivalry for who will control it develops. That middle-age woman was in love with a man her age who was in love with her but both could not go through their love for various honorable reasons, for various pledges they had taken to their masters, the woman her fighting master, the man his Buddhist spiritual master.These two go after the escaping girl and finally find her in the hands of a witch who has drugged her. They bring her back to consciousness but the witch comes back from some errand and the fight will poison the man and the witch with the witch's poisoned darts. Then the younger woman learns from the middle-age woman where the young man she loves is and she goes there to meet him, to share her love with him one single night and then escape anew in the most Buddhist way possible by flying into the mountain mist and finding enlightenment and merging with the cosmic energy of the mountains. The young man will remain behind and mourn her forever. A love story film with two love stories crossing and in both cases love can be at most exchanged for a very short period of time because of full dedication to a wider and deeper objective, be it the loyalty to a sword and a martial art, or be it a Buddhist pledge to reach enlightenment.

But I personally feel this is one of Wes Craven's best films and is very underrated. To start with, it has interesting characters that are easy to relate to which I feel is a very important thing for any film to have because if you don't care about the characters, you won't care what happens to them and if the viewers don't care what happens in a film then it is a total failure. Matthew Laborteaux (who people may know as Albert from The Little House on the Prairie) is perfectly cast as Paul Conway, the main character of the film who is a genius and is even friends with an adorable robot named BB. His convincing performance makes the character likable and easy to care about. Kristy Swanson plays the character of Samantha who I personally felt very sorry for because she had to live with an abusive alcoholic of a father. Her character's life is very sad and she doesn't deserve to go through what she has to on a daily basis. Another performance that stood out was Anne Ramsey as Elvira, the grouchy old next door neighbor the audience loves to hate. Her performance was hilarious because she was so mean and her crotchety attitude made for some great and memorable moments.This film starts out as your typical, cheerful '80s movie about the new kid in town and has a light, comedic atmosphere to begin with. But when the film becomes serious, there are very emotional moments that will definitely leave an impact on the viewer's psyche. It touches on issues such as alcoholism, domestic abuse, love, and death. The story is very creative. It is a love story as well as a horror film and to me it doesn't feel like any other film I've ever seen. There is one death scene that most audiences remember this film for. If you haven't seen it, I won't spoil it for you, but if you have, you know exactly what scene I'm referring to. The death sequence came out of nowhere and was immensely shocking. Overall, this was a well written, well acted film with interesting characters. The only flaw I noticed with the film is the ending. Again, I don't want to give too much away for those who haven't seen the film but it is not the way I would've ended the film whatsoever. But other than that, the film is perfect and one of my absolute favorites of all time. If you haven't seen this film yet, you absolutely should because it is a true, underrated classic.

Before then, most silent films were still short and quickly put out. It took nearly a year for Chaplin to finish this movie. Although this film started out as another short film, by the time it was done, Charles taken more shots and retakes than any film before as done. By completion, it had grown into a six reel feature film. The Kid is thought to be influenced by Chaplin's own childhood and what was happening at the time in his life. At the time his wife Mildred Harris was pregnant. On 1919, she gave birth to a malformed boy that die 3 days later. The event took its ton on Chaplin's personal life. It seems to have influenced Chaplin's work, as he planned a film that turned the Tramp character into the father figure of a young boy. You can see that he transmute his personal pain into something that stir people hearts. His relationship with Mildred Harris have become soured to the point, that Charlie Chaplin became afraid of her trying to steal the film from him during the divorce hearings. The film opens up with an unwed poor mother (Edna Purviance) coming out of a hospital with a baby. You can tell it's illegitimate, as in Chaplin's life, who was himself illegitimate, edits the image of the father an artist burning the photo of the woman. The woman hold the baby and walks as if Jesus holding a cross which is shot fading out. It's hard to tell what Chaplin meant with this explicit Christian symbolism, but the symbolisms returns throughout the film confusing more people. I can only sense that Chaplin was going for fragility, and transience of true moments of human love, over the sacrifice of pain. By having a halo seem to appear the mother head for a few moments, it might represent Virgin Mary. Anyways, she comes across on her self-journey seeing a bride who just got marry. The bride drops a withered flower, symbolizing her loss of virginity. By doing this, I believe it represent her sacrifice her life by marrying an old man that she does not love for money. Within a few seconds, Chaplin takes pose symbolism that commit on hypocritical American piety, puritanism, and organized religion. It's hard to make a saint out of this movie character when she gives up the kid in hope of a better life by leaving the child in a rich person's car. Instead of an rich person finding the baby, two thefts stole the car, and tossed the baby out near some trash cans. It is there, that the Tramp (Chaplin) find the baby and does everything at first to dispatch of the baby, even contemplating throwing the infant into a street grating. While it might be a bit funny, its dark humor isn't what I thought of this family movie coming in. It was a bit disturbing for the Tramp to even think that way. Anyways, the Tramp accepts fatherhood, and adopts the kid. 5 years pass, and the baby grew up as John (Jackie Coogan). John help the Tramp get work by breaking windows for him to fix. Meanwhile, the grief-stricken Edna has seen the error of her ways and leaded a life of charity. Edna and John meets when John started a fight with the local bully. It is here, that Edna believes that John is her long lost child. Soon the Tramp get into trouble too, as agents of the law figure out that the kid isn't his own and try to send the boy to an orphanage. That scene alone will get you emotional. The Tramp now has to try to find a way to keep his only love from being taken away, not only by the law, but the mother wanting to see him. The movie goes pretty good until Dreamland, sequence with angels in residence and devilish interlopers with temptation arrives in the form of 12-year old Lita Grey, whom Chaplin would marry and bitterly divorce in real life (Grey was the source of inspiration for Vladimir Nabakov's Lolita). That is where it lost focus a bit. I didn't like the ending as well. In no way, should John ever be reunion with the mother who abandon him. Jackie Coogan does a great job. It's weird in a way that the actor would end up playing Uncle Fester years later on 1964's Addams Family. There are several version of this. In 1971, Chaplin, who was eager to share his work with a new generation, that he re-cut the picture, resulting in a version that was shorter. I thought the scenes he cut were very good and added a little more depth to the characters. There is a crucial 80-second scene which is missing in that version. The mother goes to a bridge and encounters something which makes her decide that she wants the child after all. Since films and soundtracks are often copyrighted separately at the time, it was hard to find the right song for the film. Chaplin wrote all of the music for his pictures and few survive over the years. The film is still riddled with age related artifacts that, even with this skillful transfer, are still present. Film grain is moderate. Black levels are sometimes weak. The gray scale is adequately balanced. Aliasing, edge enhancement and shimmering of fine details are all present and sometimes distract. The audio is 5.1 and nicely balanced. I couldn't see the lettering in my version. Overall If you are a Chaplin fan, this movie is a must have. If you are not a fan, but are curious what all the fuss is about, this movie will let you know. Without a doubt, one of the most beautiful, moving, and tearful both in sadness and in joy, movies ever made.

The movie goes pretty good until Dreamland, sequence with angels in residence and devilish interlopers with temptation arrives in the form of 12-year old Lita Grey, whom Chaplin would marry and bitterly divorce in real life (Grey was the source of inspiration for Vladimir Nabakov's Lolita). That is where it lost focus a bit. I didn't like the ending as well. In no way, should John ever be reunion with the mother who abandon him. Jackie Coogan does a great job. It's weird in a way that the actor would end up playing Uncle Fester years later on 1964's Addams Family. There are several version of this. In 1971, Chaplin, who was eager to share his work with a new generation, that he re-cut the picture, resulting in a version that was shorter. I thought the scenes he cut were very good and added a little more depth to the characters. There is a crucial 80-second scene which is missing in that version. The mother goes to a bridge and encounters something which makes her decide that she wants the child after all. Since films and soundtracks are often copyrighted separately at the time, it was hard to find the right song for the film. Chaplin wrote all of the music for his pictures and few survive over the years. The film is still riddled with age related artifacts that, even with this skillful transfer, are still present. Film grain is moderate. Black levels are sometimes weak. The gray scale is adequately balanced. Aliasing, edge enhancement and shimmering of fine details are all present and sometimes distract. The audio is 5.1 and nicely balanced. I couldn't see the lettering in my version. Overall If you are a Chaplin fan, this movie is a must have. If you are not a fan, but are curious what all the fuss is about, this movie will let you know. Without a doubt, one of the most beautiful, moving, and tearful both in sadness and in joy, movies ever made.

All those combinations make The Fog one of John Carpenter's best film's but a Horror classic.The Fog tells the story of a fictional town named Antonio Bay,California and it residents who are about to celebrate the town's 100th Anniversity. On the 100th Aniversity the residents of Antonio Bay are being stalked and killed by vengeful ghosts who are surrounded by Fog and Mist. Now,the residents in Antonio Bay have to figure out how to stop the ghosts before they destroy the entire town.The Fog is an amazing,scary,frightening and Horror classic that John Carpenter did two years after his breakthrough Horror classic Halloween and is what introduced me to my all-time favorite filmmaker director John Carpenter. The Fog was also one of the first Horror films I ever saw as a kid that truly scared me and after you watch this film you will never look at fog's or mists the same way again. One of the main reason The Fog is such a great Horror film is because it's basically an old fashioned classic ghost story that is almost like a story you would hear by a campfire and as you listen or in this case look at the story you are scared out of your mind and you are pulled into a sense of dread and fear and right from the start you are pulled into a creepy and terrifying nightmare where anything can happen and you don't know what to expect and The Fog is a truly intense Horror film that grabs you by the throat and doesn't quit until the very end. Another one of the main reasons The Fog works is because of it's dark and scary atmosphere and the photography by Dean Cunday because where most Horror films rely on blood and gore to scare and frighten the audience,Carpenter uses great and creepy atmosphere to scare viewers with shots of the fog and mist keeping viewers on the edge of your seat with suspense and fear not knowing when and where terror and violence is going to strike. Blood and gore is great for a Horror film but a Horror film also has to have an amazing atmosphere to be effective and the atmosphere in The Fog is very scary and will haunt you. The scares in the film are well-done with wonderful white hot suspense and skill because Carpenter is a master at building up suspense and tension when the suspense and tension stops each suspenseful scene explodes with a great scare and in each of the scary scenes in The Fog are surprising and shocking and will have you jumping out of your chair and will make you leave the light on and look over your shoulder. The creepy photography by Dean Cunday is just fantastic because with Cunday's photography The Fog has a distorted look to it that is very beautiful and at the same time dark and creepy. Dean Cunday's amazing and eerie photography is one of the reasons The Fog stands out and is a great Horror film. The main characters in the film are very sympathetic and likable with wonderful depth that when the horrible things start to happen we root for the main characters and we want them to live and survive. The characters aren't in the film to be slaughtered and taken out but are in the film for a reason. The ghosts in The Fog are scary and creepy because you never really see them because they are hidden behind The Fog. There are glances and peeks but we never see their faces which I think makes the ghosts in The Fog terrifying and very memorable because in The Fog you never hear or see the face of evil. In many way John Carpenter is continuing the theme of pure evil from Halloween only this time he's telling a ghost story. The violence in The Fog is effective and shocking and definitely fits in with the film's dark and scary tone but the violence is not bloody or gory because this film is about atmosphere. The ending of this film is a great and is a classic Carpenter ending,a conclusion that is truly scary,shocking and unexpected and a powerful cap off to this Carpenter classic.The whole cast is great in their roles. Adrenne Barbeau is excellent and sexy as Stevie Wayne,a local radio host. Jamie Lee Curtis is brilliant as Elizabeth,a hitchhiker and Nick's love interest. Janet Leigh is fantastic as Kathy,the town organizer. Tom Atkins is great as Nick Castle,a local fisherman that falls for Elizabeth. Hal Holbrook is amazing as Father Malone,a local priest who discovers a secret. John Houseman is effective and creepy in his small role as Mr. Machen,a sailor who tells a scary story in the beginning of the film. Special effects master Rob Bottin is scary and effective as Blake,the leader of the ghosts. Ty Mitchell(Andy)and Carpenter regulars Charles Cyphers(Dan),Nancy Loomis(Sandy),George 'Buck' Flower(Tommy)and Darwin Josten(Dr. Phibes)give good performances as well. Also lookout for an uncredited cameo by John Carpenter in the beginning in the role as Bennett.John Carpenter's direction is brilliant and stylish,with Carpenter always moving the camera and giving the film a scary visual style,tone and atmosphere. Great direction,John.The score by John Carpenter is excellent,scary,creepy and effective and adds to the film and matches the tone and each major scene perfectly. Great score,Carpenter.In final word,if you love John Carpenter,Horror Films,Ghost films or Supernatural Films,I highly suggest you see The Fog,a scary,effective and creepy Horror classic that belongs in every Horror fans collection.

He's also behind Dune, a terrible film, although this was a much the studios fault as his own. Fire walk with me, however, is also terrible - and here there's no one to blame but the man himself. This is Lynch out of control.Twin Peaks - the TV series is brilliant, but uneven. The show balances so many ingredients - a murder mystery, surrealism with supernatural overtones, soap opera clichés, parodies of soap opera clichés, romance, and absurd comedy. The pilot is an absolute masterpiece, and the first season is one of the best things ever shown on television. The second season opens with a killer Lynch-directed episode. The second season continues fairly strong, then loses its focus completely midway, and finally gets a little bit better towards the end. By the last episode Frost and Lynch had returned after leaving the helm of the ship for awhile, frustrated by ABC forcing them to make decisions they didn't believe was in the best interest of the show. The drop in quality mid season 2 wasn't their fault - for more info on this, watch the excellent Making of Twin Peaks documentary. By the end of season two Frost and Lynch knew the show would probably get cancelled and Lynch decided to go out with a bang - a very Lynchian bang. The last episode is complete surreal weirdness - a path that the Twin Peaks movie continues its fiery walk on. The balance of all the different elements, Mark Frost being the levelheaded scriptwriting pro to Lynch's surrealist auteur, is now replaced with Lynch following his every hunch and throwing the idea of having a traditional narrative out the window. However, TPFWWM is far, far less entertaining as a whole than the last episode of the TV show.I'd only recommend Twin PeaksFire walk with me if you've seen the entire Twin Peaks series. And even so, you can just as well skip it. It doesn't add to the enjoyment of the show, and is mostly for completists. The film does have a few great surreal dream sequences, where you can sense the magic touch Lynch can have when he's in the zone. But the film has several problems that even his feel for mood, cinematography and sound design can't solve.First of all, the film lacks an overarching narrative - something even the surreal Lynch films Eraserhead, Lost Highway and Mullholland Drive had (more or less). What's it ABOUT? Well, the film is split into two parts, and they have almost nothing to do with one another. The first part revolves around FBI agents and the murder of a girl killed by the murderer of Laura Palmer a year earlier. The second part - which makes up most of the film - is the part set in Twin Peaks showing the last days of Laura Palmer. However, this is the polar opposite of what made the beginning of the TV series so compelling. The TV show started with a mystery and had a plot that slowly revealed more and more, keeping the viewer hooked. If you've seen the show you won't find a lot here you didn't already know - the mystery is already revealed, it just feels like a tedious waiting game. And if you see this film without having seen the show, you'll just be confused and feel alienated. In both cases you'll be left wondering why was this film made?Another problem is replacing Lara Flynn Boyle with Moira Kelly - it probably would have been wiser removing Donna Hayward from the plot altogether. A lot of sets are also noticeably different from how the TV series looks. The exterior shots in sunlight, the streets, the houses, Shelly and Leo's place, Harold Smiths room - the don't look like they did in the TV show. All this affects how you view the film coming from seeing the show - you don't feel like you're in Twin Peaks. This actually ruins some of the magic of both this film AND the series. It ruins the illusion and the feeling of Twin Peaks being a real place.And the feel of Twin Peaks is, as mentioned, gone. The movie is very dark and takes itself very seriously, often crossing the line towards being pretentious. There's very little comedy and parody to lighten the mood. Scenes are either completely cliché (most of the actors do a good or decent job delivering the completely uninteresting dialogue) or Lynch being weird for weirdness' sake. Watch the second episode of the show - it's directed by Lynch and perfection from beginning to end. The surrealism doesn't feel forced, it seems to flow naturally and furthers the story - not the case here.I felt compelled to write this review since a lot of the reviews of TPFWWM on IMDb are either rave reviews by Lynch fans who love everything he's done, or people who don't like Lynch or who haven't even seen the Twin Peaks series bashing the film. Well, I'm here to give my two cents - the middle ground. I love Twin Peaks and I'm a huge fan of Lynch's style when it works (like in Mulholland Drive) - but Fire walk with me doesn't cut it. It's the only Lynch film that I feel is a waste of time seeing - if there is a puzzle here to solve, I don't feel like solving it. I'd rather hold on to the feeling the TV show gave me, and maintain the mysterious feel around who Laura Palmer was when she was alive.David Lynch's son does look cool with that bird mask on though. I'll give him that.

The movie is very dark and takes itself very seriously, often crossing the line towards being pretentious. There's very little comedy and parody to lighten the mood. Scenes are either completely cliché (most of the actors do a good or decent job delivering the completely uninteresting dialogue) or Lynch being weird for weirdness' sake. Watch the second episode of the show - it's directed by Lynch and perfection from beginning to end. The surrealism doesn't feel forced, it seems to flow naturally and furthers the story - not the case here.I felt compelled to write this review since a lot of the reviews of TPFWWM on IMDb are either rave reviews by Lynch fans who love everything he's done, or people who don't like Lynch or who haven't even seen the Twin Peaks series bashing the film. Well, I'm here to give my two cents - the middle ground. I love Twin Peaks and I'm a huge fan of Lynch's style when it works (like in Mulholland Drive) - but Fire walk with me doesn't cut it. It's the only Lynch film that I feel is a waste of time seeing - if there is a puzzle here to solve, I don't feel like solving it. I'd rather hold on to the feeling the TV show gave me, and maintain the mysterious feel around who Laura Palmer was when she was alive.David Lynch's son does look cool with that bird mask on though. I'll give him that.

He's also behind Dune, a terrible film, although this was a much the studios fault as his own. Fire walk with me, however, is also terrible - and here there's no one to blame but the man himself. This is Lynch out of control.Twin Peaks - the TV series is brilliant, but uneven. The show balances so many ingredients - a murder mystery, surrealism with supernatural overtones, soap opera clichés, parodies of soap opera clichés, romance, and absurd comedy. The pilot is an absolute masterpiece, and the first season is one of the best things ever shown on television. The second season opens with a killer Lynch-directed episode. The second season continues fairly strong, then loses its focus completely midway, and finally gets a little bit better towards the end. By the last episode Frost and Lynch had returned after leaving the helm of the ship for awhile, frustrated by ABC forcing them to make decisions they didn't believe was in the best interest of the show. The drop in quality mid season 2 wasn't their fault - for more info on this, watch the excellent Making of Twin Peaks documentary. By the end of season two Frost and Lynch knew the show would probably get cancelled and Lynch decided to go out with a bang - a very Lynchian bang. The last episode is complete surreal weirdness - a path that the Twin Peaks movie continues its fiery walk on. The balance of all the different elements, Mark Frost being the levelheaded scriptwriting pro to Lynch's surrealist auteur, is now replaced with Lynch following his every hunch and throwing the idea of having a traditional narrative out the window. However, TPFWWM is far, far less entertaining as a whole than the last episode of the TV show.I'd only recommend Twin PeaksFire walk with me if you've seen the entire Twin Peaks series. And even so, you can just as well skip it. It doesn't add to the enjoyment of the show, and is mostly for completists. The film does have a few great surreal dream sequences, where you can sense the magic touch Lynch can have when he's in the zone. But the film has several problems that even his feel for mood, cinematography and sound design can't solve.First of all, the film lacks an overarching narrative - something even the surreal Lynch films Eraserhead, Lost Highway and Mullholland Drive had (more or less). What's it ABOUT? Well, the film is split into two parts, and they have almost nothing to do with one another. The first part revolves around FBI agents and the murder of a girl killed by the murderer of Laura Palmer a year earlier. The second part - which makes up most of the film - is the part set in Twin Peaks showing the last days of Laura Palmer. However, this is the polar opposite of what made the beginning of the TV series so compelling. The TV show started with a mystery and had a plot that slowly revealed more and more, keeping the viewer hooked. If you've seen the show you won't find a lot here you didn't already know - the mystery is already revealed, it just feels like a tedious waiting game. And if you see this film without having seen the show, you'll just be confused and feel alienated. In both cases you'll be left wondering why was this film made?Another problem is replacing Lara Flynn Boyle with Moira Kelly - it probably would have been wiser removing Donna Hayward from the plot altogether. A lot of sets are also noticeably different from how the TV series looks. The exterior shots in sunlight, the streets, the houses, Shelly and Leo's place, Harold Smiths room - the don't look like they did in the TV show.

I didn't think much of it, but it greatly gave me an idea of how iconic Casablanca was and knowing of Humphrey Bogart. Fast-forward to adulthood and now I've finally watched it and seen what the fuss was about.Did it live up to the hype? I think so, but as I was watching it, I was starting to think I might not really like the movie by the time it ends. When things were getting too sentimental, my cynical side was cringing, but then once the story opened up more, I began to see that the story was addressing themes of love and virtue that we all can relate to as human beings. It's the two things that make a human being human and we as human beings know that those two things may require things of importance of us to be sacrificed and that can be either good or negative. It's a character study of one person's struggle with those two ideals.What I love about Casablanca is that it is not at all cynical, but at the same time it's not all sunshine and rainbows. What it does have, most importantly, is a lot of heart and it is a film that can remind us all of our humanity in that we're all susceptible to our vulnerabilities to the people we cherish the most and that could potentially destroy us, but Casablanca finds triumph in that and asks each and everyone of us to find triumph in our adversities for the sake of keeping our hearts pure. Any film that asks something like that is a film that is sure to be remembered and to remain in the hearts of not only people looking for entertainment in movies, but also heart. And that is what makes Casablanca a pure classic, in my opinion.
