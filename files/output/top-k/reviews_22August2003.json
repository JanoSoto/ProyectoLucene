Maybe it was because I still thought that some day someone smart would come along and make a good Halloween sequel. It will never happen. I have a message for all of you Halloween fans. Do what I'm doing. Give up the ghost. Don't expect a good Halloween sequel to come. After this terrible movie I gave up hope for a good sequel. Comparing this movie to the very first Halloween would be a joke. First there was a great horror film made called Halloween. It had John Carpenter and he did a great job. Then after seeing how well Halloween was received they decided to make more money and make Halloween 2. No Carpenter, just Rick Rosenthal. By the way, years later they were so desperate that they brought him back for Halloween Resurrection. AKA Halloween Homecoming. Halloween 2 was definitely the last you were supposed to see of Michael Meyers. It's obvious at the end of 2 that he's dead and it's not even left open for a sequel. A third Halloween was made. There was supposed to be a whole bunch of Halloween movies with different stories. The idea fell through and they brought back our chalk faced murderer again. I guess after 2 he survived after being burned alive. I guess he also got a new pair of eyes because last time you saw him he was shot in the eyes and swinging his knife around. After that they just couldn't leave him dead. With Halloween 4 you got a not so bad, but disappointing sequel to the Halloween series. Still yet another movie was made that couldn't hold a candle to the very first. I was disgusted after 5, but after seeing this movie with bad writing, directing and acting that's when I knew they finally lost it. This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. After this I didn't bother anymore. I heard from people that the best part about a recent sequel; H2O, is that it ignores 4, 5, and this garbage. That's sounds okay to me. I'll check it out, but I'm not expecting anything fantastic. The people who are making the Halloween sequels are making suckers out of us. I think we should let the next one fail at the box-office. They're not movies they're magnets that attract Halloween fans with high hopes for a good sequel. Don't waste your time or money. Give up on the Halloween series. Just see Michael Myers as I do.

You don't even notice the black & white after a while.  It was funny, edgy, and true. This movie is primarily about Dante Hicks who is a Clerk in a Convenience store.  He is in his early 20's and doesn't plan on going to college.  He likes life the way it is, simple.  Although as you will see, life is far from simple for Dante Hicks.  The basic idea of the movie is Dante is called in to work on his day off.  He agrees to come in because he is under the impression its for a little bit, but is dead wrong.  Nothing can go right on this day.  He gets company from his good friend Randal Graves who is the complete opposite from him.  Dante is nice, kind, and cares about what people think.  Randal has no respect for anyone and you will laugh out loud, at his lack of respect throughout the movie.This movie is a Cult Classic and is a must see.  It was only made for $25K+.

Sam Mendes directed with great heart, great precision, and great attention paid to every detail. The story, while not as epic in scope as, say, The Godfather, is strong and compelling. You can't help but watch this movie and get involved in it. People who say it's unemotional or that they felt detached from it have been reading too many books about movies; that, or they're big, big fans of the Scooby Doo movie.Paul Newman is terrific here; how could he not be. Jude Law provokes chills as the photographer\/killer. Tyler Hoechlin is a child actor who can actually act.Another big star is, of course, Conrad Hall, whose cinematography goes beyond words into the realm of the fantastic. This is one of the best LOOKING movies of all time. I would love to have seen it on the screen, but unfortunately, Dreamworks did not release it to many theaters here in Texas. Shame.Which leads us to Tom Hanks. Here is the Great Man, in a great role. Who would have thought the star of The Man With One Red Shoe (or, how bout this one, Bonfire of the Vanities) would go on to become the De Niro of the Nineties, and now the 21st century? Hanks is a movie star on a par with Tom Cruise and Mel Gibson -- no doubt. He took over the Everyman slot once occupied by Kevin Costner and made it his own. But he brings to the role of Michael Sullivan the mythic presence of Harrison Ford, while becoming the character as thoroughly as De Niro became Jake La Motta.I'm tripping over myself to heap praise on Hanks' work in Road to Perdition. It's deserved. This is a performance to get stupid over. Strong, brooding, powerful, reserved, moral, conflicted, Hanks shows us a man trapped in a job that he hates (think Lester Burnham), a job he's nonetheless very efficient at doing. We believe he can handle firearms, we believe he can kill people, but Hanks never lets us believe he does it for fun. We don't catch him showing off. When Hanks shoots a guy in the head, he does it because he's forced to. When Hanks, as Sullivan, gives you an order, you carry it out because there's the impression that he's slightly more ethical than you are. I don't care that he's a hired gun; Sullivan just has that weighty, unspoken authority.So, even if Road weren't excellent on every other level, Hanks would make it well worth seeing. By the way, the movie isn't slow, but well paced, which used to mean something in Hollywood, and to audiences. Thanks, MTV!

I vaguely remember when this movie was in the theaters but I don't think anyone I know actually went to see it. Imagine my surprise, almost 10 years later, when it's rated the #2 movie ever made by IMDB users! Having finally had a chance to see the movie, I'm still just as surprised.This isn't a bad movie. It's a good movie. In some ways, it's a very good movie. But it's certainly not a great movie. Better than Casablanca? Better than Citizen Kane? Better than The Seven Samurai? I don't think so. As cornball melodrama, it's not even better than the first Star Wars. What could possibly account for this movie's inexplicable popularity?As I say, it's not a bad movie. The acting is generally good, and Freeman and Robbins are both typically excellent. Roger Deakins' photography is, of course, gorgeous. The story itself is compelling (a page-turner), as are most of Stephen King's stories.Yet under it all, the story is just as much a fantasy as any of King's horror novels. While it's presented as a serious drama about prison life and the tenacity of the human spirit (and make no mistake, every emotion, every significant action in this movie is foreshadowed, highlighted and generally telegraphed to the degree that there's absolutely no doubt as to how the director expects you to react), the storyline and characters are so simplistically drawn that the movie wouldn't have rung significantly less true if an army of vampires had appeared in the final reel. This is a mawkish, sentimental and highly manipulative movie where the evil characters are pure, unadulturated evil and the good characters are the unsullied embodiment of pure nobility. It's the male equivalent of one of those Lifetime Channel movies where the woman's abusive boyfriend sleeps with her sister, steals her car, poisons her cat and kidnaps her developmentally disabled daughter to another state. It's pure melodrama, and while the great performances and photography make it enjoyable to watch, they can't change the fact that it is, Freeman's voice-over notwithstanding, a fairy tale.It's hard to really care for anyone in this movie because the characters and their struggles are so completely cliched and cartoony. There never seems to be the least chance of Robbins' sprit being broken and the rest of the prisoners rarely seem any more perturbed by their incarceration than the prisoners on Hogan's Heroes. There is something of a plot twist near the end, but it's telegraphed almost two hours in advance and there isn't really any question of the movie ending up any differently than it does. What we're left with is a beautifully-filmed, well-acted movie without the slightest hint of subtlety, nuance or ambiguity. This is the sort of movie where it's not enough to give the hypocritical, self-righteously religious warden a wall hanging that says His judgement cometh, and that right soon. We also have to cut to a quick shot of the hanging right before the warden gets his comeuppance, just to make sure that not one single person in the audience misses the incredible irony.It's supposed to be a celebration of the triumph of the spirit, but since there never seems to be the slightest chance that Robbins' spirit *won't* triumph, we're left with no more genuine suspense than we would get waiting for the cavalry to appear in an old-time western. What could have been an above-average B-movie has been turned into an overwrought, ham-handed, pretentious melodrama.

I vaguely remember when this movie was in the theaters but I don't think anyone I know actually went to see it. Imagine my surprise, almost 10 years later, when it's rated the #2 movie ever made by IMDB users! Having finally had a chance to see the movie, I'm still just as surprised.This isn't a bad movie. It's a good movie. In some ways, it's a very good movie. But it's certainly not a great movie. Better than Casablanca? Better than Citizen Kane? Better than The Seven Samurai? I don't think so. As cornball melodrama, it's not even better than the first Star Wars. What could possibly account for this movie's inexplicable popularity?As I say, it's not a bad movie. The acting is generally good, and Freeman and Robbins are both typically excellent. Roger Deakins' photography is, of course, gorgeous. The story itself is compelling (a page-turner), as are most of Stephen King's stories.Yet under it all, the story is just as much a fantasy as any of King's horror novels. While it's presented as a serious drama about prison life and the tenacity of the human spirit (and make no mistake, every emotion, every significant action in this movie is foreshadowed, highlighted and generally telegraphed to the degree that there's absolutely no doubt as to how the director expects you to react), the storyline and characters are so simplistically drawn that the movie wouldn't have rung significantly less true if an army of vampires had appeared in the final reel. This is a mawkish, sentimental and highly manipulative movie where the evil characters are pure, unadulturated evil and the good characters are the unsullied embodiment of pure nobility.

In most of his other comedies (`Meet the Parents', `There's something about Mary') he played the protagonist who is the subject of the jokes, and it's great to finally see him as the antagonist as he has a good flair for comedy. Particularly funny is his part as a merman in the informecial for water. As the over-flamboyant opposition, Owen Wilson has rarely been funnier. Will Ferrell's obnoxious fashion designer Mugatu is a half-realised character. He starts out funny but towards the end becomes increasingly annoying. The rest of the support is decent all round from Christine Taylor, Milla Jovovich, John Voight and David Duchovny among others including a host of celebrity cameos.The real star is the script that holds many memorable one-liners. And while many of the lines are delivered with impeccable gusto, others just fall flat. A good example is the classic `You can't think for yourself' `You're right, I can't' line. It isn't bad, but it's been used many times before and seems a little slack when attempted here. While it is shapeless, absurd and just as shallow as the subject matter itself, `Zoolander' is also one of the funniest movies around at the moment. If you want a good `stupid' comedy `Zoolander' is a passive and entertaining bit of gas. Just don't expect anything else. My IMDb rating 6.4\/10.

What kind of stupid movie title is that?? Why would you want to hurt yourself like that. While it did only okay in the box office, eventually it became a cult classic. I saw part of it on a Movie Channel a few years after it was released, and really liked it but I hadn't seen the whole thing. A message board I went to ranked it as the best movie of all time.

This is now my favorite movie ever.The movie mixes genres....it's like a crazy mix of a Drama, Black Comedy, and a Thriller. And that's one of the many reasons why it's so great. The beginning of the movie shows the Unnamed Narrator ( Edward Norton) struggling through life. He is wealthy, but seems to think his life has no puprose. He works in the day, goes home, and spends all of his money on possessions and expensive things that he does not need. He is a slave. He is also cursed with insomina. Eventually, he finds freedom and hope by going to support group meetings for people with diseases. This helps him sleep and makes him go on with life like a normal person. Until Marla Singer ( Helena Bonham Carter) starts attending support group meetings, and like the Narrator, she is a faker. With another faker, the Narrator can't cry at the meetings to be happy or sleep at night. So they agree to split up there meetings.

The Narrator's condo blows up, and has no where to go, until Tyler lets him live at his delapitated house where he makes soap ( He is a soap salesmen and other jobs include a projector who splices porn into children movies and a waiter at a hotel).

What I haven't heard anyone talk about is the place that his misogyny plays in that&#133; he's lonely and isolated and sees women as objects, so as he goes insane he thinks he's a vampire, someone who picks up young women, rapes and kills them&#133; and is cursed by this. In this movie, Nic cage HATES women, and a lot of discomfort comes from how horrible he is to them. I thought it was also ingenious how his therapist, the imaginary vampire woman, the woman he jilts near the beginning, and his secretary all look vaguely alike.

On one level it try's to compete with 'star wars' and appeal to kid's, I remember when the film was first released, seeing 'Dune' colouring books in Woolworth's!!!! On the other hand it tries to appeal to the sci-fi fan (most who would have read the book). Unfortunately it ends up being unsatisfactory for both groups. (If you try to please everyone, you end up pleasing no-one). The biggest failure is the representation of the 'Fremen'. The hardest most ruthless troops in the known (Dune) universe are the Emperor's 'sardauka' (sp)? warriors, and the Fremen are even harder than these!! What we are given is a group of wimpy looking hippy's that would have a job kicking ANYONE'S ass. I've read certain posts that complain about the antiquated technology even though set in the far future. I read the same sort of thing in posts about 'Brazil' If these people just don't get it, I'm not going to waste time xplaining it to em.

In fact, it's one of the worst films I've seen recently and this is after watching SILO KILLER and SCARECROWS. SLAUGHTERHOUSE is as bad as SCARECROWS. Everything about it is truly pathetic. Being a big TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE fan, I had hopes that this film would be a fun rip-off. It's not. It tries to be funny and scary and it's not even close to being funny (in a good way or bad way) and it's definitely not scary. The only thing scary about this woeful film is the acting. I've never seen such bad acting put on film! The acting in an Ed Wood movie is usually better than the acting in this dreck. There's a scene inside the slaughterhouse, when the fat killer is above one of the businessmen and taunts the businessman with a weapon. That scene is the most pathetic example of acting I've ever seen in a film. I regretted watching this horrible film. It's bad and to be avoided at all cost.

In real life if you told this story you'd just say I met a guy through this girl, and be done in about 4 seconds but the writers cannot reign in their desire to embroider every scene with cutesy. The cutesyness takes over. The female best friend's scene in which she berates Lisa Kudrow for the enjoyment of superior-minded viewers is brutal, not funny. I could barely continue after this inept, harsh intrusion got plastered onto this slight movie. It's a strange mix. The plot is flimsy but the characters are at least as insecure and flawed as those you'd meet in a real gay bar.This script must have appealed to Don Roos because it overexplains, over sets things up, and over-resolves things, just like his movies do. Writer Dan B is absolutely terrified of letting two lines go by without one being a punchline, and his talent is just not up to that speed.At least as one-sided and phony as the gay movies mocked in the script. I dream of gay characters in the future free from the influence of Will & Grace, but for now let's neurotically pretend we're all adorable.

Too many things in life and on the news can make you feel that it is all doom and gloom.  This film however shows you how life should be and what the truly important things are.  Most people, if they got a chance to live a day over and over would do the same things as Phil Connors, trying to make things better for themselves.  However, this can just lead to rejection and frustration.  Phil eventually realises that life is more rewarding when he gives to others and ends up getting all that he wants.On top of this moral theme, there is brilliant humour.  For example, when he is drunk and driving the car with the two deadbeats.  After they crash the car and are stopped by the cops, they ask for an order of flapjacks.All actors were well suited for the roles (including Phil - the groundhog).  The location and music were also perfect.This film is one you can watch over and over and over....

Aliens is THE best blend of action and Sci-Fi that has yet been made. If you like war movies or action movies or Sci-Fi then this is the movie that you've been waiting for. It is easily the best of the Alien films and the best movie that James Cameron has put out. That is saying a lot but Aliens is no ordinary film. I won't go into the plot because if you wanted to know that then you can look elsewhere on the Aliens page but suffice to say the story promises much and delivers in spades. Everyone in the movie makes their character work from all the Colonial Marines to Sigourney Weaver (Ripley) herself. I will always know Paul Reiser as the scumbag Burke and Bill Paxton will always be Hudson no matter what else either of them do. The set design and prop design of this film are a sight to behold and the makers of this film succeeded in making whatever point in the future this movie is set in come to life. (Throughout the Alien series, there is no mention of date, I'm sure there is a tiny reference somewhere but I'm obviously not hardcore enough to sniff it out. If somebody knows let me know.)The design of the Marines armor, weapons, and vehicles delivers special praise because I can really see Marines in the future looking like they do in the film. That they still use projectile weapons is something that I won't even try to get into here. At least they're caseless. The aliens themselves are the greatest contribution to the world that H.R. Giger has ever made, his weird art nonwithstanding. The bio-mechanical look of the aliens is a great design. The whole look of the movie is simply incredible. Bottom Line This movie rules, buy it and put it on the mantlepiece in a lighted, dust-shielded alcove. Then worship it in a pagan fan-boy ceremony. Or better yet just leave it in the DVD player all the time.
