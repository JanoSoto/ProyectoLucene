This is a truly great film, but not without flaws.I really enjoyed the fun situations in this movie; Donkey, the fairy tale characters and the up side down-turned point of view of the fairy tale formula. And of course, the great and superb animation (it's a shame that Dreamworks recent animated movies doesn't have the same great animation). Donkey was no doubt the greatest character! Shrek were not the nicest guy in the town, but still not unlikeable either. Princess Fiona were a little more weaker character than the two lads, but still likable. And the voice talents of the characters are doing a great job!It seems like everybody I know absolutely adore this movie and I understand why. But still I'm considering the flaws in this picture.HERE COMES SOMETHIN' THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED AS A SPOILERFirst; Shrek music theme on the movie (on the opening, who is on the audio commentary revealed as Fiona's theme); it's absolutely awful! Why did composer Harry Gregson-Williams had to compose such an awful theme? The rest of the score is not at all bad, but that theme sucked! Otherwise, the songs were great and they stays in the background of the movie. What this movie really is missing is some action sequences, because Shrek has a lot of quiet sequences, which is not bad at all, but in the length of the movie, it's getting too much of them. The third act of the movie was a little disappointing as well (when I watched it for the first time) because it's contain predictable spoilers and then the story became a totally rip off from The Wedding Planner with Jennifer Lopez.

If you expects a historical lesson, you are on the wrong movie. If you expects a film similar to Aladdin or The Lion King, you'll be disappointed. But if you are gonna take this movie for what it is, you'll experience an enchanting and magical film, although it has some flaws that doesn't make it reach higher.Pocahontas is the Disney flick many loves to hate. Once I understood the hatred. Ironically, I loved this movie after seeing it for the first time on the theater, but during the years every view of this film became variable. Now I truly appreciate this movie, although - again - it has some flaws, which unfortunately mess up what could otherwise be an masterpiece.But lets talk about it later.Pocahontas is, actually, a very lively and vibrating film, with many fast camera swoops (resembling Mike Gabriel previous and underrated film, Rescuers Down Under). The animation is stunningly beautiful. The colors of art director Mike Giamo are rare and special. The filmmakers have succeed to make the forest an enchanting place.Pocahontas is also a more moody film, accompanied with Alan Menken's most beautiful and complex score made for an Disney film (is it just me, or does this score resembles the Beauty and the Beast score?).The songs are successful too, personally I liked them all, except The Virginia Company, which didn't gave me anything. Otherwise, each song is enchanting and fills the story on its own merits (although Savages does have very hard hitting lyrics).The characters are drawn in a more angular way and it's obvious that the animators had many live action reference during making the expression of the human characters faces, which resembles real people. The Indians are presented in a very authentic way (by giving them Indian words), which are something to give Pocahontas a more authentic and mature feeling.Pocahontas herself is beautiful and wise, but she may be to complex for children to relate to. John Smith is an likable guy, although Mel Gibson's voice feels stoic. I liked Meeko, Ben, Lon and Thomas, the other characters were dull and boring (especially the uncharismatic Nakoma). I used to like Grandmother Willow, but now I find her a little annoying, actually. While most of the voice actors performs well, Russell Means (Chief Powhatan) really stands out, along with Billy Connolly (Ben) and Joe Baker (Lon). The film is preachy, yes, but I liked the message, cause it's actually a good and important one; taking care of the nature and each other. I usually like Disney climax scenes, but I confess that in 1995 I found it refreshing that Disney tried something new with not having a big battle at the end (although I still wonder how the film would be then).But now I'm gonna mention the flaws Pocahontas stood out to be different from is Disney predecessors for having more serious story - and this film is one of Disney's most serious, with an almost bitter tone. I think this film fits more to the adults than the kids, referring to the complexity of the love story and the mature feeling of the film.That case of Ratcliffe being a weak villain isn't one of the worst issues (for me). More worse is the script, who's straightforward and narrow. The film wants to be a drama, but feels rather bitter than actually dramatic. When the tension between the settlers and the natives speeds up, there's not much to light up the mood and that makes Pocahontas more heavy-handed.The speechless animals stands for the comedy, but I still think the directors should had overview the movie before releasing it, cause there are some parts where the comedy doesn't fit. Of the animals I liked only Meeko, Percy and Flit were uncharismatic. I saw The Lion King three times and Pocahontas twice at theaters and the audience laughed most during Pocahontas.Another weak part is, actually, the ending. Not because the lovers don't get together, no, practically because the only unhappy Disney-ending feels forced, rushed and out of context. It seem stupid that Smith would randomly be wounded by Ratcliffe, for then be send back to England and would probably die during the trip. And Pocahontas actually had the chance to go with him. I wish that Disney would stick to their original ending, where Nakoma explains Poca why she shouldn't leave and where they're singing the final words of If I Never Knew You when Smith is lifted up to the ship. At least Disney succeed to make the tragic ending overwhelmingly sad, actually the most saddest Disney moment ever.Speaking of If I Never Knew You I thought it was wise to cut the song and then put it back on the DVD ten years later. It's a complex and adult song, which would be to complex for the kids and actually I don't think I would like to sit during that song on the theater if I were a kid (since I saw this movie on theater as an 11-years old). But it's a beautiful song.If you manage to look through all the flaws and take this film for what it is, you'll have an enchanting experience. The rest is up to you.

Some see these as anti-Hollywood but the actual reason for them was that after the war, the Italian film industry was in ruin and they were practically broke, so making these simple films about simple people was a natural outgrowth, though some of the groundwork for this style began during the war.The story itself is about a poor man who is out of work but is finally able to secure a job using his bicycle. The problem is that soon after starting back to work, the bike is stolen so he spends the rest of the film searching for the bike (sort of like PEEWEE'S GREAT ADVENTURE, but not a comedy). Later in the film, the focus is not just on the bike but on the relationship between the man and his young son. There really is nothing more to this very simple plot, but it is a fascinating time capsule into the desperate state of Italy until its rebirth in the mid-1950s.The fact that THE BICYCLE THIEVES is so well known and respected is a testament to the fact that many in the know aren't really that smart after all. What they actually didn't realize is that the director (DeSica) did several other films that were at least as good, if not better. I have heard and read much fawning praise for this film while at the same time wondering how these critics can discuss THE BICYCLE THIEVES without mentioning his other great works. It wasn't like THE BICYCLE THIEVES was his one crowning achievement as director--it's just that this one was discovered abroad and by the Oscar people (AMPAS). I challenge you to watch MIRACLE IN MILAN, UMBERTO D or especially THE CHILDREN ARE WATCHING US and then tell me that THE BICYCLE THIEVES is THE great masterpiece.

To me, Sixteen Candles was unrealistic, Pretty in Pink was unsatisfying and Ferris Bueller was totally over the top. But fluke or not, I have to give him credit for writing the best high school movie (for once I do agree with Entertainment Weekly).What makes The Breakfast Club so special then? I'd like to think it's the characterisation. Despite being such stereotypical brain\/athlete\/basket case\/princess\/criminals, the cast somehow makes it all work and adds so many distinct dimensions to the characters that you can relate to everyone. Never have I met someone who has said they couldn't identify with anyone from The Breakfast Club.

Yes. Yes, it could; most certainly aided by the level of fruitage employed by Terence Stamp as the titular General Zod, resplendent in black, pseudo-leather, thigh-high disco boots and heavier eyeliner than Heidi Fleiss.Director Richard Donner, filmed *Superman* (1978) and *Superman II* simultaneously for expediency. Creative differences between producers Ilya and Alexander Salkind and Donner caused Donner to jump ship before finishing *II*, leaving inferior director Richard Lester to salvage the shreds of two movies' worth of footage into a cogent sequel. Consequently, *Superman II* is two movies mashed together to make HALF a movie. Badly scripted (by too many cooks &#150; Mario Puzo, David Newman, Leslie Newman, Tom Mankiewicz), badly acted (by *Superman*'s principal cast Christopher Reeve, Margot Kidder, Valerie Perrine, Marc McClure, Gene Hackman &#150; well, Hackman's good in anything, but his scenes in *II* were shot with Donner, and he refused to do any more scenes for *II*, which resulted in stand-ins finishing his job from behind), badly directed (Lester's forte was comedy), badly edited (by John Victor-Smith, with amateurish looping and unsalvageable scenes that had to be included because nothing else was shot), badly scored (by Ken Thorne, trying to augment the great John Williams' music, but churning out a bombastic hash instead); were it not for Superman himself &#150; that blue-clad icon with the red towel tied 'round his neck burned into our neo-cortexes since birth &#150; this movie would be as unbearably ludicrous as E.G. Marshal's wig. Superman hurls a nuclear bomb into space, which is so powerful it releases three Kryptonian super-villains from the *previous* Superman movie - Zod (Stamp), Ursa (Sarah Douglas, as some kind of sadomasochist dyke) and Non (Jack O'Halloran, as a big dumb galoot) &#150; who, all possessing the same powers as Superman, decide to conquer Earth just as Superman decides to conquer Lois Lane by inexplicably abdicating his powers to show his love for her. Smart move, puss.Did Kal-El fail to consider that trailer-park Lois fell in lust with a SUPER man and that the loss of his powers would translate to a 9-to-fiver brain-fry existence, coming home to find Lois with a mud pack on her face watching Jerry Springer, ignoring the screaming kid? And having an affair with Green Lantern. After all, that's what she fell in love with &#150; super powers. In brightest day, in blackest night \/ No evil shall escape my sight&#133; Whatever you say, Greenie, you had me at Let's fly to Paris for lunch&#133;Kal-El's disembodied mother (Susannah York &#150; because Brando wouldn't) warns him that there will be Far Less Pussy once he takes the Irreversible Step in becoming human; nonetheless, Superman enters an anti-super chamber, gets irradiated with brothel-red lights and leaves the chamber in chic John Holmes threads and a really bad hairstyle. Cue 70's porn music.Meanwhile, General Zod is camping it up in Midwest Podunk with his dyke and galoot, orating cheese in High English vernacular, then kicking the badass American army in the groin and storming the White House to make the President (E.G.

Producer Steven Spielberg hired David Koepp to do a rewrite on the script by Ed Solomon which in all fairness ended up pretty good, it doesn't take itself too seriously & was based on character's from a comic book that only ran for 6 issues in 1990 & it's no co-incidence that the film feels like a comic book itself, it's very over-the-top, it's quite funny at times & it's even occasionally witty as well. There's a touch of satire here as the whole alien cover up issue is played for laughs as it's a commonly accepted theory. The cheeky & jokey Will Smith plays nicely of the deadpan Tommy Lee Jones, there are some funny one-liners, some neat aliens & it moves along at a nice pace. There are some good set-pieces as well although overall the story is average fair & while it's undoubtedly fun to watch there's not much substance beyond flashy CGI computer effects & once the whole Men in Black idea has worn off by the 30 minute mark it doesn't really have anywhere else to go & becomes a bit repetitive.Director Sonnenfeld does a fine job, the special effects scenes are impressive & the film has visual flair & style. The alien creatures are very imaginative like the little guy in a mans face controlling him or the baby squid like alien or the worm guy's & all the other's that are dotted throughout the film.

She transforms into Poison Ivy, a nature beauty whose charms bewitch men and whose kisses are venomous.Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy have totally opposite plans and have apparently no reason to team up, but that's what happens anyway and Batman and Robin have to thwart their evil plans.Add Bane (Jeep Swenson) who was once one of the most intimidating villains of the comic books, but is now a simple non-talking savage who takes the part of Poison Ivy's servant. There's also Barbara (Alicia Silverstone), the niece of butler Alfred (Michael Gough), who discovers the family secret and joins in the action under the name of Batgirl.The movie lasts for two hours and five minutes, but five minutes are wide enough to convince anyone of the foolishness and the absurdity of this mediocre film. And not necessarily the first five minutes. Anywhere in the movie, we can find ludicrous sets, poorly conceived action sequences and one-dimensional characters, all of this is leaded by an abysmal script from Akiva Goldsman and directed by Joel Schumacher of whom we could ask if he really had the taste and the motivation to proceed to the production of this movie.When you look at the actors, you could ask yourselves why Arnold Schwarzenegger is top-billed. In the 1989 Batman movie, it was worth it because Jack Nicholson (as the Joker) was by far the greatest actor of the lot. In the case of Batman & Robin, I guess that it's the actors' salary which determined their position in the credits since Schwarzenegger received about $20 million for his role.The question now is why did he receive so much money for such a shabby performance? His terrible one-liners and puns about ice have become instant classics, but for the wrong reasons. His plans doesn't make any sense and where do these henchmen come from and what is their interest in working with a man whose only interest is to save his sick wife? There again, suspension of disbelief...Uma Thurman plays the Mother Nature role in this film, but with such a performance, her credibility has been just passed under the lawnmower.As for George Clooney, it's not his performance that is disappointing, but rather the fact that he plays a character he's not made to play. He's probably the most charming Bruce Wayne of the series, but also the least interesting, since he doesn't display any tortured soul or psychological scar. Those characteristics have been better handled by Michael Keaton and Val Kilmer. And his girlfriend Julie Madison (Elle Macpherson), where does she come from and what is her role here? The only good point about Clooney came well after the movie's release when he famously declared I think we might have killed the franchise. Well, a fault confessed is a half redressed.As for the two young heroes O'Donnell and Silverstone, they're not bad, but not interesting either.The city of Gotham, previously a very Gothic city filled with Metropolis-inspired expressionist buildings, is now assaulted by ridiculous skyscrapers and monuments shaped like giant people, whose origins go back to Batman Returns (remember the Max Shreck speech in the beginning?).The Batmobile is almost unrecognizable and is now a convertible, just like if somebody intended to mix the vehicle of the '60s TV series with the one from the Tim Burton films. Batman and Robin own an upgraded arsenal of completely silly technological gadgets, the worst being the skates magically going out from their boots.

And the gold medal this image of Poison Ivy holding a flower with a viper head seems to be taken from an Ed Wood picture.It is so sad for Batman, whose franchise has known very glorious and happy times, that he has to be treated so miserably by people having more interest for their wallets than for the fate of one the most appreciated superheroes in the world.

At age 17 I was hugely interested in it, and went to see it one day in the middle of the week at a downtown theater.It is October 30, 1988 - 10 years after the murder of 16 residents of Haddonfield, IL by an escaped psychopath. In the middle of the night, an ambulance makes its away along the road from Smith's Grove to the Ridgemont Federal Sanitarium where Michael Myers has been housed for the last 10 years. Soon, the monster of Halloween 1 & 2 is on his way to another institute, and comes to life inside the ambulance. He brutally murders the ambulance crew & heads towards Haddonfield - again.Young Jamie Lloyd, Myers' niece, has been adopted by the Carruthers family. She is tormented by a nightmare involving her evil uncle, in a terrifying sequence which the audience does not know is a dream (at first). It isn't long before Dr. Loomis & Dr. Hoffman, head of Ridgemont, are alerted by the state police after the ambulance is found upside-down in a river, destroyed and bloodied by Myers' homicidal violence. Loomis immediately heads for Haddonfield, and encounters Myers at a gas station where 2 other people have been murdered. After Myers blows up Loomis' car, the doctor is forced to hitchhike to Haddonfield as Myers races towards it in a stolen tow truck.Shortly after, Jamie & her adopted sister Rachel head for a store to buy a Halloween costume. Unknown to them, Myers is already there, and he acquires his coveralls & evil-looking knife. This is a well-filmed, frightening sequence in which Jamie holds up the costume on herself in a mirror, then the image changes to that of a 6-year-old boy who killed his sister 25 years before. Suddenly a dark figure appears behind Jamie, when she turns around she sees Myers pull the frightening pale mask down over his face. Myers moves towards her but quickly retreats from sight after Jamie screams, and he goes to stalk out Jamie's home.Loomis has reached the sheriff's office, and alerts Sheriff Ben Meeker to Myers' return. Meeker immediately puts the town into a state of curfew so the police can hunt Myers down, and then he & Loomis start looking for Myers themselves. A power failure caused by Myers forces Meeker to call the state troopers in following the savage murders of a group of officers by Myers, and a group of shotgun-toting truckers led by a man named Earl start going after Myers themselves. When the sheriff leaves to try to stop them, Myers goes after Jamie & Rachel in a deadly game of cat-and-mouse. It will end in a nail-biting confrontation between Myers & Earl's men - and the most frightening twist ending I have ever seen in a horror movie! The late Donald Pleasance, as usual, plays the role of Dr. Loomis brilliantly - as a man who has not only seen the evil incarnate that makes up Michael Myers but also dares to confront it. Ellie Cornell as Rachel & Danielle Harris as Jamie are also excellent as the 2 young ladies who find themselves the unwilling targets of Michael Myers' homicidal mission. George P. Wilbur is seen but not heard as the stomping, savage Michael Myers - a role he plays so well because of his slow-but-deliberate, lumbering presence.Director Dwight H.

And they don't. The main point with Carpenter is that he manages to produce and set up some crucial moments when we don't know who is who and where we are, in reality or in virtuality, in a real murder or in a fake hoax. And that is when we get over the limit and manage to believe the unbelievable. Carpenter is also extremely good at keeping the film in dark shadowy half lights that are necessary for him to play on the depth of the picture and to hide what is going to come out of the dark without any due process of announcing itself. You must not look for any deeper or wider meaning, because there is none, except that we accept to be the eye of the camera, or we accept the camera to be our eye, hence we accept to be voyeurs inside a film that is itself a voyeuristic adventure since we capture the action through cameras and TV screen relayed onto the internet and a portable telephone. We are confronted to at least two if not three levels of voyeurism with the organizers of the first level becoming the direct victims of the adventure, and then the guinea pigs of these becoming the victims of the voyeuristic and exhibitionistic game they had accepted to get into. And even further the audience of these two levels on the Internet becoming themselves victims of the game because they believe it is a game even when it turns more than sour. It is the use of a portable telephone via an instant messenger that will enable this voyeuristic audience to become compassionate. And we, the voyeurs of Carpenter's film, are like innocent angels victimized by Carpenter and his tricks and what's more we enjoy it and would like to see some more, so that we even know, accept, desire and enjoy the very last punch line that closes this film without closing Michael Myers' eyes he is eternal because after all this is reality TV and not any virtual fable told by some perverse deranged greedy film director.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne ","genre":null},{"date":"31 July 2007","score":"8 out of 15 people found the following review useful","review":" John Carpenter is always just as good as good can be because he knows his trade and he knows how to pull the strings that are going to frighten us, terrorize us or just gross us out, and there are many strings that must not get entangled.
