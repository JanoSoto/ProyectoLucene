I am almost glad, however, that I came to this film at a later point as comparing it to other films of its sort (of which there are certainly many, many excellent ones) simply proves that this is a perfect film if there ever was one. Rififi is dazzling and engaging from start to finish, simultaneously a masterful thriller and captivating drama, and quite possibly the most plausible, realistic, and involving heist film of all time, and among the most perfectly engineered Noir films ever made.Rififi runs for just over two hours but moves at a faster pace than just about any other film I've seen, consequently feeling less than an hour long. The sheer intensity of the film is relentless with even the opening scenes dedicated to developing the characters and setting up the premise of the film are absolutely beautiful and integral to the film as a whole. Enough has been said about the heist sequence already but it really is one of the tensest and most entertaining sequences in cinema and quite possibly the single greatest heist sequence ever filmed, not to mention the most plausible.Rififi is far from a simple crime thriller, providing a thorough examination of human behavior and psychology which is worked into the main plot excellently in the screenplay written by Dassin, René Wheeler, and Auguste Le Breton (who also wrote the novel the film is based on). It is always interesting to see a crime or specifically a heist film where the heist itself doesn't even come close to failing but by the simple inclusion of the human element the consequences are tragic.Beyond just featuring a perfect screenplay, Rififi is nothing short of a visual masterpiece.

Finally, Philippe Agostini's stunning black and white photography helps the film maintain its terrific atmosphere and sense of style.Rififi, outside of my personal favorite film Vertigo, is quite possibly the most involving, intense, and purely entertaining film ever made.

Gang-lords Ushi-Tora and Seibei occupy either end of the community, each with a small army of hired fighters. The bitter standoff that exists as a result has turned the village into a desolate place - well, except for the undertaker, for whom business is very good indeed. After a short time observing these things, the samurai decides on the best way to use his skills at killing to remove the two gangs and return the village to normality.It is really too easy to get home in the evenings and play a film that requires no attention and very little work and, as a result, there are several subtitled films that I have recorded and\/or bought that sit unwatched long after purchase. However recently I have been using my LoveFilm to make more of an effort to watch films that really I should be more familiar with and at the moment that is meaning catching up on some key films from Akira Kurosawa. I make this sound like work but actually it is good for me to focus wholly on any film but also the quality thus far has been high.Yojimbo, like Seven Samurai, will be familiar to many viewers without even watching it simply because of the amount of references and remakes it has since influenced. The remakes range from the good to the terrible (and those that think that Last Man Standing is the worst remake ever should watch Van Damme's Coyote Moon or (even worse) Albert Pyun's Omega Doom), but without a doubt Yojimbo itself manages to stand at the head of the crowded pack. There is still a misconception though that somehow because it is foreign and black and white that it will be a heavier film without the action or entertainment value of remakes such as Fistful of Dollars, but, as stated, this is a misconception. On the contrary, Yojimbo feels slick and fresh 40+ years later and provides the viewer with much to enjoy and few weaknesses as it goes.Clearly influenced himself by American westerns, Kurosawa delivers a film that is cool, funny and dramatic - with all parts working well together and none dominating the others. He shoots it with such a good eye (with cinematographer Miyagawa) and very little visual clutter (either things or style) that the viewer cannot help feel impressed by how striking the samurai looks in the middle of the film but he never lets this style take away anything. With the exaggerated villains and side characters, the film is much more comic than I expected and it is more enjoyable for it as it also then helps us be in the mindset of the samurai (to a point) by seeing it as a bit of a game - an aspect that the dry and serious tone of Last Man Standing did not have and cost it dearly as a film. It is not anything to have you rolling with laughter but it is funny. Importantly though it doesn't detract from it as an engaging game of a story and it does have plenty of action and drama as the samurai plays out his plan.In the middle of all this it would be deeply unfair not to credit the importance of Mifune in the film's success. That the character looks easy is down to him because his presence and air of cool scheming compliments and is complimented by the overall style of the film. He delivers his lines with a certain amount of cockiness, but not ever enough to be arrogant, and his body language and screen presence make him instantly engaging. He is well supported though by plenty of actors doing good work to be comic characters but also still be useful as dramatic devices (ie the villains still offer a threat even if they are quite funny); Sazanka, Kawazu, Tono, Sawamura, Watanabe etc are all good even if they do stand in the shadow of Mifune. Nakadai's Unosuke (the gunslinger) doesn't get enough credit in my opinion. To me he was important because he conveys a cool sense of menace similar to the samurai's but yet also ensures it is always mean rather than clever, brash rather than precise and based on the gun he carries rather than anything about him as a man (which is how Mifune comes across).Yojimbo has countless remakes out there for you to check out - some good, some bad, but the original stands up strong in the pack. Without any real weakness the film is almost effortless in being cool, funny, engaging and entertaining. It is worth noting that everything looks easy - the performances, the blend of comedy\/drama\/style, the story, they all work together so naturally that one assumes that it just happened whereas of course it is down to those involved in the making and delivery.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"28 July 2008","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" The more I watch The Silence of the Lambs the more I think that Hannibal Lecter is given far too much attention. Anthony Hopkins' performance is the shortest ever to win an Oscar for best actor in a leading role, and it really isn't much of a leading role. Sure, he is an integral part of the movie both in performance and plot and he is the main feature of what is by far the film's greatest scene, but he is no more than a supporting character. A great supporting character at that. One need not look further than Ridley Scott's Hannibal to see that he works best in a more or less limited role. It is amazing that just about everyone who discusses this film, even 17 years after its release, focuses on no more than 16 minutes of the film's running time.The only real lead character in the film is Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling. As effective as Hopkins is I'm going to have to say that Foster's performance is the best and most nuanced in the film. Without a really good actress in the lead role this film might have been a massive failure not only commercially but also simply in terms of the storytelling mechanics of the film. It is still to date Foster's finest performance, and she really gets a chance to shine in the final thirty minutes of the film.The Silence of the Lambs is probably Jonathan Demme's best dramatic feature. His concert films and other documentaries are almost all excellent but The Silence of the Lambs is the only time a scripted effort from him has really been consistently excellent. The film still suffers minor issues, for example Demme's insistence on numerous occasions on having his actors deliver dialogue directly to the camera. It's rare that such an approach works and although it allows for some of the most memorable shots of Lecter in the film it also works against the tension building up in the scenes. All in all, however, Demme's work here is consistently excellent and two scenes in particular, both in the final hour of the film, stand out as some of the tensest, creepiest scenes in early 90's film. Ted Tally's screenplay is essentially perfect given the sort of film this is. I'm not convinced he's a very strong writer in general, but he has enough to draw on from Thomas Harris' novel to write a tight, concise screenplay for the film.

Anthony Hopkins' performance is the shortest ever to win an Oscar for best actor in a leading role, and it really isn't much of a leading role. Sure, he is an integral part of the movie both in performance and plot and he is the main feature of what is by far the film's greatest scene, but he is no more than a supporting character. A great supporting character at that. One need not look further than Ridley Scott's Hannibal to see that he works best in a more or less limited role. It is amazing that just about everyone who discusses this film, even 17 years after its release, focuses on no more than 16 minutes of the film's running time.The only real lead character in the film is Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling. As effective as Hopkins is I'm going to have to say that Foster's performance is the best and most nuanced in the film. Without a really good actress in the lead role this film might have been a massive failure not only commercially but also simply in terms of the storytelling mechanics of the film. It is still to date Foster's finest performance, and she really gets a chance to shine in the final thirty minutes of the film.The Silence of the Lambs is probably Jonathan Demme's best dramatic feature. His concert films and other documentaries are almost all excellent but The Silence of the Lambs is the only time a scripted effort from him has really been consistently excellent. The film still suffers minor issues, for example Demme's insistence on numerous occasions on having his actors deliver dialogue directly to the camera. It's rare that such an approach works and although it allows for some of the most memorable shots of Lecter in the film it also works against the tension building up in the scenes. All in all, however, Demme's work here is consistently excellent and two scenes in particular, both in the final hour of the film, stand out as some of the tensest, creepiest scenes in early 90's film. Ted Tally's screenplay is essentially perfect given the sort of film this is.

The film just isn't as well put-together as the other two (we'll leave the most recent addition for another day) and plays like a very fast-paced card trick that is meant to distract you from the fact that the magician's act isn't very good in the first place. The plot is part of the problem. It's so insubstantial, it's difficult to even remember as you're watching the film. At least in the other two movies, there was a degree of curiosity on the audience's part as to what powers the Lost Ark might contain, and whether the Holy Grail really existed. In 'Temple of Doom,' I frankly couldn't have cared less whether Indy found the magic stone and returned it to its village. It sounds like something Spielberg and Lucas dreamed up on the set during a coffee break when they realized they needed a plot. If there's a sense of blown opportunity here, it's with the lead female character, Willie. Kate Capshaw is, hands down, the most appealing and fetching of the series' first three leading actresses, and it's just her bad luck that she got stuck in the worst film of the three. The script doesn't give her much to do other than show exasperation, but she shows it about as well as it can be shown, and the fact her character isn't given more to do just reinforces the general air of disappointment one feels with 'Temple of Doom.' One of the best moments in the film is an all-too-brief flirtation between her and Indiana Jones, but like every other bright idea in the movie, it is cut short so we can move on to something else. Short Round (Jonathat Ke Quan), the young Chinese boy who Indy seems to have adopted, is an amusing character and has a few funny lines. In another movie, he might have made more of an impact as well. Here, he's strictly comic relief. The one bit everyone seems to remember from 'Temple of Doom' is the gross-out eating scene in some palace. Raw snakes, giant beetles, and monkey brains (served in the original monkey heads, no less) are consumed with great gusto, while a horrified Kate Capshaw looks on. It's probably the best staged scene in the film. Not much, I know, but with 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,' the pickings are pretty slim.

At minimum, it should have earned a 10 rating.Unfortunately, director Steven Spielberg and the writers did not spend enough time teaching us &#150; perhaps, via the film's children &#150; about dinosaurs. Instead, there are too many dumbing-down scenes with dinosaurs relentlessly hunting people and humans doing all sorts of incredible gymnastics to stay alive.On the plus side, the movie has several wow moments involving gentle dinosaurs. The special effects are tremendous. When the characters first saw dinosaurs on the island near Costa Rica, I felt as awestruck as they did. Later, we see a dinosaur born in a lab, Laura Dern's character helping a sick dinosaur, a dinosaur eating plants a few feet away from Sam Neill's character and the two children, and dozens of gazelle-like dinosaurs sprinting away from a massive meat-eating predator. These scenes were spectacular.There are also a couple of interesting scenes focusing on the mean carnivorous dinosaurs. But, the meat eaters just don't stop chasing the humans. The action goes on and on and on. The longer these scenes go on, the more Jurassic evolves from a fascinating science fiction story into a trite action-adventure.I'm for action-adventure, and liked that the plot included a greedy computer expert played by Newman of Seinfeld conspiring to steal dinosaur DNA. Newman's comeuppance was enjoyable, and Jurassic was better because his behavior caused the dinosaurs to escape from their habitats and go after innocent people.But, there were many times that I wanted the pace to slow down and listen to the dinosaur experts played by Dern and Neill discuss the various species of dinosaurs. I also wanted to see more scenes with different species interacting with each other, more everyday scenes of dinosaurs doing whatever dinosaurs do, and even more scenes of the people interacting with the gentle dinosaurs.Spielberg, I think, missed a wonderful opportunity to educate the public in an entertaining way. An excellent movie would have balanced education and entertainment, but Jurassic took a mid-story turn toward entertainment, and I wasn't particularly entertained.The dinosaurs the movie focused on were more like people obsessed with winning. As far as I know, animals chase their prey, succeed or fail, and then look for other prey. They don't fail, but then spend hours looking for the prey that escaped from them instead of looking for other prey. If dinosaurs are that smart, I would have liked to hear the dinosaur experts discuss what else they could do.Spielberg deserves credit for inserting personal touches in the middle of his action-adventure and developing the Neill character from a child-hater into a child-lover although his quick transformation was a bit implausible. I also liked the comic relief of Jeff Goldblum's character, but the writers needed to explain better why a statistical theorist\/philosopher was in the movie in the first place.I also think that the Richard Attenborough character was too much like the Dr. Frankenstein character. Here, was a brilliant entrepreneur who spent years pursuing his dream of re-creating life. Then, as soon as his experiment goes awry, he &#150; like Frankenstein &#150; wants to abandon his dream. The ending would have been better if viewers were left thinking about whether dinosaurs coming back to life was a good or bad thing instead of watching a black-and-white anti-dinosaur position.I cast an 8 for Jurassic Park when I initially voted on it, but the more I think and write about it, the more I conclude it deserves a 7 instead because it really missed an opportunity to be great.ZWrite ","genre":null},{"date":"28 July 2008","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" The very concept of dinosaurs coming back to life is so fascinating that Jurassic Park had the potential to be one of the best movies ever.

I find it rather pretentious and for most entries into the genre, silly and\/or melodramatic. But Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings is an exception. It's a grand adventure filled with limitless energy and likable characters. The series is at the top of the IMDb Top 250 list, and rightly so. The first installment is extraordinary.I'm going to skip over the plot because by now everyone knows it. The acting is pitch-perfect across the board. Elijah Wood has clearly grown out of his kid roles, and is terrific as Frodo. His co-star Ian McKellen may have gotten the Oscar nod for his role, but Wood equals him. Likewise, McKellen finds the right note for Gandalf. Everyone else is perfectly suited for their roles as well. Special note goes to Sean Bean, who made a career out of playing creeps and villains, is successful as Boromir, and shows that he has more range than people may give him credit for.The stakes were incredibly high for this film series, and obviously it paid off. Peter Jackson deserves much of the credit. His work here is the fantasy answer to George Lucas' Star Wars saga. Unlike much of today's CGI, it wasn't done cheaply, and everything looks authentic, and the result is breathtaking. It's hard to tell what's real and what's not. But Jackson's skill goes beyond the effects. Much of the acclaim of Tolkien's series is the fact that he created a whole new world. Jackson does the same thing; it doesn't feel like a bunch of effects were added to sets or everything was in front of a blue screen. Jackson has created a whole new world, just like Tolkien did.Of course, this would not be worth anything if Jackson and his co-writers hadn't written a screen adaptation that was worthy of the book (which I have not read). Everything moves smoothly and nothing feels left out or short-changed.Many films have been destroyed by too much hype. But The Lord of the Rings The Fellowship of the Ring is so grand that nothing could diminish its spectacle. And what a film to deserve it!

Something he should do more often. His writing style is often fresh and engaging. Its unfortunate that he spends all his time nowadays churning out mediocre stuff in front of the camera, when his work on the printed page really crackles with wit. Look no further than the underrated Shopgirl. Martin's best film in ages, and all because he was acting from a script he wrote.LA Story is quite possibly the one worthy film of Steve Martin's in the 1990s, because right after, he started the gradual decline of his career. Unchallenging, soft-headed fluff that were a waste of Martin's talents. Beginning with the trite and terrible Father of the Bride. And it only got worse from there.But LA Story had Steve Martin at the pinnacle of his powers. It is to Los Angeles what Woody Allen's Manhattan was to New York. LA Story is a film bound to sharply divide people. If you can swallow the film's pill (and its a pretty big pill I'll admit), you'll find much to enjoy. If you can't, LA Story will most likely leave you cold. Look no further than Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel's opposite sides of the spectrum regarding this film.Martin plays wacky weatherman Harris K. Telemacher. Harris takes the daily grindings of LA life in his stride. He's come to expect the random muggings, the snooty restaurants and the dull as dishwater art museums that are all part of the wonderful world of Los Angeles. But he couldn't possibly have expected help in his lovelife from an electronic road sign. Before long, Harris is caught between two women in his life, the free spirited SanDeE* (Sarah Jessica Parker, brilliant!) and the prim English rose, Sara (Victoria Tennant).The success of LA Story rides upon how much you're willing to give in to the film's conceit. After all the very idea of a freeway sign being a possible oracle of the ages is bound to raise more than a few eyebrows. But I put disbelief aside, and was swept away by the film's dazzling turns and delightful wit. As I said before, Steve Martin's skills as a writer have often been undervalued, and his rich and accessible screenplay makes LA Story an astonishing, powerful ode to the city of Los Angeles.Steve Martin's feelings about the city can often seem ambivalent. On the one hand he doesn't resist the temptation to satirise LA's shallow, superficial side (who wouldn't?!). But on the other, buried within the film's jokes and opinions, there does seem a gentle affection for the city. Perhaps even an admiration. The different people we meet all seem to ennoble a particular facet. To the point that the city of Los Angeles almost takes on a life of its own and becomes a character in of itself.Steve Martin's trademark manic energy is relatively restrained here (barring his hilarious weather forecasts, always wrong), but his enthusiasm for the role shines just as bright as LA itself! He never misses an opportunity to make a glib quip about LA. There are really too many to mention, but none of them feel unwelcome. And he's supported himself with a fine cast.In a brief but very memorable role, Marilu Henner plays Harris' vain, upwardly mobile girlfriend Trudie. A woman that embodies everything wrong with LA. Even when stuck in traffic, she's more concerned with outward appearance. Her relationship with Harris is hilarious, and when he learns she's been cheating on him for three years, his response is priceless (this has been going on since the 80s!).The scene stealer of the whole film is Sarah Jessica Parker. What a wonderful performance! Although she plays the role of a typical ditzy, LA valley girl, she brings so much energy and enthusiasm she walks away with the entire movie. Never has SJP had such fun in a film. Clearly enjoying herself immensely, she hops, skips and cartwheels her way from one end of the screen to the next. If she stood still for more then ten seconds she would probably explode! The crux of the film is the blossoming love between Harris and Sara, but I was secretly hoping he would wind up with SanDeE*!But no. That could never be. Victoria Tennant is Steve Martin's true love (ironically three years before they divorced). I'm not convinced Tennant is all that much of an actress, but her straight-faced style of acting is appropriate when confronted with the outlandish city streets of LA. She's as baffled by its wackiness as Harris is.And things don't get much wackier than the ending, where it seems LA itself steps in to play matchmaker between Harris and Sara. Its an ending of such cosmic proportions it will either leave you completely awed or cursing the heavens. I chose the former. The ending could seem ridiculous, but not when you take the rest of the film into account beforehand. The emotional climax is earned the way it pieces it together from lots of different elements scattered throughout the film. But that's something you couldn't possibly know until you've seen the film a few dozen times.LA Story is a true classic. Mick Jackson's direction is so whimsical and lush, every frame bursts out with a joy and exuberance not often found in Hollywood entertainment. I felt flattened by the film's finale, helped no end by the exhilarating Exile, sung hauntingly by Enya. It all adds up to a rather delectable confection. They say Los Angeles is the City of Angels. I think of it more as a City of Dreamers. And LA Story shows how the dreams of the few can sometimes come true.

I know the story has very solid metaphors for fearful discrimination but after awhile it's like we get it enough. It's almost to easy to pick up on character motivations in the film, play, or novel adaptations. You know where the story is pretty much headed. It's always thoughtful and mildly interesting but as a film form it's boring and tedious. I also had a problem with Ryder because she was convincing but I saw my four teenage friends play her much scarier, and portraying her for the crazy-messed, kooky, demented bitch she was not just someone like Ryder who showed she was mildly disturbed and only motivated to get Proctor in trouble not because she actually thought she was doing the right thing in her own world. I cant overlook that they seriously all out-performed a star like Ryder (in my opinion she is so over-rated and now people realize it) Like I said I had a different experience. Aside from Lewis(I learned so much watching him) and Allen I was bored to sleep.

Oh, and also because they form the easiest excuse for scriptwriters to justify the events in the film, no matter how absurdly grotesque and far-fetched they are! These movies open with a lovely collection of environmental images whilst a narrator with a firm and serious voice informs us that nature's ways are unfathomable and that modern science has only just begun to unravel some of its oddest mysteries. So, if you want to make a movie about a gigantically over-sized mantis, all you have to do is claim that it's one of nature's many mysteries and you actually get away with it! The Deadly Mantis is a wondrous example of prototypic 50's Sci-Fi and, once again, I totally don't understand why its rating around here is so low. Admittedly the concept is vastly implausible (actually just a blind attempt to copy the success of Them and Tarantula) and the acting performances of the entire cast are laughably wooden, but these are almost fundamental characteristics when talking about B-movies from this decade! Moreover, The Deadly Mantis contains more positive elements than you would anticipate, like professional camera-work and special effects (the giant mantis looks genuinely menacing), fast-pacing (no tedious and dreary sequences like in most contemporary low-budget horror films) and some efficient moments of suspense. The Deadly Mantis starts with an unusually long voice-over, as the narrator doesn't just talk about the mysteries of nature but also elaborates &#150; in great detail &#150; about radar networks in Northern America and Canada. Quite interesting and educational, but not exactly relevant. Following a volcano eruption, a mega-sized mantis awakes after millions of years of being buried in ice and promptly begins to devour random soldiers stationed in a military base in Greenland. The giant bug continues his journey southwards and leaves a trail of hysteria and destruction. The military teams up with eminent palaeontologists for finding methods to destroy the nearly indestructible creature. The Deadly Mantis is a fairly standard and overall forgettable B-movie from the 50's, but it nevertheless guarantees 80 minutes of good fun. Certain sequences are quite inept and clumsily handled (like the mantis attacking the Eskimo village, which almost looks like a Benny Hill sketch without the silly music), but director Nathan Juran nonetheless maintains a reasonable tempo and succeeds in making his main characters amiable. This clearly skillful director moved on to slightly more acclaimed projects after this, like 20 Million Miles to Earth and The 7th Voyage of Sinbad. If you like old-fashioned monster flicks and big bug attack movies, please disregard the negative reviews and give The Deadly Mantis a look.
