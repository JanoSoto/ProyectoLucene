[{"date":"16 September 2009","score":"","review":" If you have seen Good Will Hunting, which was directed by Gus Van Sant, the same director as from Finding Forrester, the you will definitely feel a small bit of deja vu at certain points of this movie. However, contrary to what many people say, Finding Forrester is not so similar to Good Will Hunting that you can't enjoy it, and I still recommend that everyone watches this movie at least once in their lifetime.Finding Forrester is about a 16 year-old boy named Jamal Wallace, played by Rob Brown, who happens to be both a brilliant student, as well as an excellent athlete. He gets offered a full ride to a private high school because of his basketball abilities, but before he even attends a class, he discovers the man that will help improve his writing skills the most. Jamal breaks into the apartment of a reclusive man on a dare from his friends, where he accidentally leaves his backpack with all of his writings. Jamal later finds all of his writings to be corrected. Curious, Jamal returns back to the man's apartment and eventually bonds with the man to the point where Jamal finds out the man helping with his writing was actually the Pulitzer Prize winning author, William Forrester, played by Sean Connery. Over the course of the story they help each other overcome their problems, and while the movie is predictable at times, it has the great message that you can find the best of friendships in the most unlikely places if you just look for them. Finding Forrester was a very well put together film, and while it fell far short of anything extraordinary, it still was a very good movie and I definitely recommend it.

And not one of the best Bonds (or the best movies I attended in a theater !).Firstly I hated Brosnan ! I didn't experience an atom of acting, attractive presence or wittiness (he thinks that fixing his tie is a funny move??!). HE'S AS FRIGID AS A STATUE. So when Q advised him don't let them see you bleed I was shouting he doesn't have blood for god's sake !!. The interpretation of Bond as a sex and violence *machine* has never been more truthful ! With portraying the role 4 times, being one of the least interesting Bonds, Brosnan presented here his worst Bond performance !I hated, with the entire world, Denise Richards! She can't act, now she can't act or look slightly sexy too ! She used to be frigid, but to tell you the truth not that frigid ! I hated the goofiness that runs in this movie's veins. For instance HOW none of Elektra's henchmen, or Elektra herself, knew about the disappearing of the bomb's microchip ? Or HOW none of the workers in the nuclear factory knew about the most wanted international terrorist who works among them without any disguise (having one apparent bullet in the head) ?!! And I didn't understand, and I think nobody ever did, HOW Bond figured out that the briefcase of Elektra's father is going to explode??!! Actually the question must be how dumb the characters in a Bond movie, or the viewers in front of it, can be ?!I hated that Bond was the one who left the Russian nice assistance to be murdered; he gave up him, ran away with the girl, then had been caught ! (So he was cowered, with No manly ethics and yes, that clumsy to be caught as well !!), let alone how M's feelings caused the complexity of Elektra's kidnapping, or how M was so naive to be kidnapped (The dignity of the MI6 was never more insulted !). I hated the idiot BIG sequence when the evil guys send a helicopter, one that chops off trees, to kill Bond ; OK, you'd find situations like that in the franchise, but less provocative, because this round I was What The Hell?? They gonna chop off the house that Bond is in it, the whole harbor, then chop him??!!.. I think there are easier, faster and more secretive ways to kill the man ! This showiness killed the sequence already !By the way I didn't hate the climax, where Renard\/the evil man puts in the large crankshaft of the nuclear rocket out of its activation duct then Bond puts it out, then Renard puts it in, then Bond puts it out again; as that was comically amusing like a Laurel & Hardy's routine ! But I hated the scene where Q got to leave for good. Not because the event itself, but for replacing him with totally uninteresting buffoon who would take off the importance of being the earnest Q in front of reckless 007. And also for Desmond Llewelyn's performance. He looked a bit tepid (the Brosnan effect? Maybe !) and his eyes didn't show was he sad? Or the opposite ? It seemed like he didn't act !I hated that the movie gives one historical intro then fails to give anything like it, or as huge, after. I hated that Sophie Marceau wasn't convincing enough (or sexy enough !). And ladies and gentlemen I hated the repetition of another usual Bond's last moment where he-has-a-girl in hot-position while his-superiors-watch-in-shock with wicked-punch-line always said-by-Q ! I know that Bond is formulaic and as much as the moment was catchy I felt that I've watched all of that before; now that's boringly formulaic ! So, what could be loved about this movie ? It's simple  the intro chase, the glasses that can see EVERYTHING !, couple of lines (one about Christmas Bond had!), the shot in which Robert Carlyle as Renard smiles before Bond Kills him (or out of the joy that someone will end his misery), Dived Arnold's imposing music (especially the memorable piece while the boat chase), and the title's song; it's certainly more effective than the movie itself.Add to that the surprise behind Elektra's character. Aside from being so unpredictable event it was the unprecedented step to finally turn the evil guy in a Bond movie into evil girl. Well, it was about time and in fashion too after M becoming a woman in (Golden Eye). 4 years later the killer machine at the Terminator series will become a woman in (Terminator 3). As you see women became more influential, evil, and metallic ! I didn't ask what Michael Apted is doing here ?! I kind of asked what the real action princes were doing away from it?!. It is only a special movie for the serious Apted, though I didn't feel anything special with the movie itself, so why to bring him in the first place ?!! He made a good movie, but averagely entertaining and without real funny feel (or intended seriousness !). When Bond, riding his advanced boat, bursts in a peaceful restaurant I imagined Connery, in a case like this, giving cynical magical smile, Dalton screaming go away, Moore stopping to taste a glass of wine then gives an opinion to continue the chase! Unfortunately, Brosnan disappoints any hope with severe features and silent eye ! This frigidness, which you feel that Brosnan intends it to be distinct among the other Bonds, separates between him and the funniness of the character on one side and the admiration of us on the other side. He makes the silly Bond real silly to say the least.Generally (The World Is Not Enough) got a face like Brosnan's; I hated that the most !

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"16 September 2009","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" It's not so often I encounter the chance to revisit a classic on the big screen yet yesterday I had that privilege to watch John Carpenter's cult horror classic 'The Thing' at the Cineworld Cinema near Piccadilly Circus. The film begins in the midst of the Antarctic snowfield where a helicopter is circling an American research base chasing down a husky with a sniper. When the helicopter crashes and the pilot is killed, the passenger survives only to continue his mission of pursuing and killing the dog and in the process shots one of the members of the research team to get to the dog. The gunman who appears to be Norwegian is shot down by the captain of the base as he obviously appears to be steered crazy and incredibly dangerous.When they eventually find out that this dog isn't what it appears to be, two members of the team, one being MacReady (played by Kurt Russel who gives a fine performance here), goes on a search for the Norwegian base to see what clues they can find. When they do find the abandoned base, they find a large block of ice which looks as if something had been frozen in it for centuries and a half burnt corps that looks like something they've never seen. Of course this corps is brought back to the base, and after a few autopsies are made, one of the doctors makes the shocking discovery of a creature that imitates cells When one of the members of the base is left alone with the remains of the creature, another team member enters the room only to discover the creature is not dead and is now in fact imitating a member of the team. When help comes forth, the creature has almost finished the process and looks exactly like the team member except for a few last features. This is where the tension really begins; paranoia hits everyone and hits them hard. Did they kill the creature? Are there any remains of the creature left? If so, has it taken shape of any other team members? Who is human and who is the creature? Who can they trust? You can even feel the tension in the atmosphere of the base, the silence, the darkness, and the reactions of the team members when they suspect another team member.If one person gets out of their sight for an instant then that person is automatically a suspect. The best example of paranoia is shown by Dr. Blair played by Wilford Brimley who delivers the best performance in the film. He discovers that if this creature reaches civilization, it will eventually imitate mankind little by little and this drives him over the edge and wants no one from the base to escape for the sake of mankind. I felt quite fortunate as to have previously visited Howard Hawk's original Sci-Fi classic 'The Thing from Another World' which is quite an impressive film especially for 1951, did not feature a shape-shifting creature, instead it featured a gigantic creature that required human blood in order to reproduce. The director John Carpenter, being a fan of Howard Hawks did not try to copy the original; instead he went back to the original novel 'Who Goes There?' by John W. Campbell Jr. from 1939 which did feature a shape-shifting creature, thus making the film more tense and more suspenseful.John Carpenter has never been known for his character build up; in fact the villains in his movies are usually mindless and lack emotion or personality as shown in this film and many others such as Michael Myers in his merciless masterpiece 'Halloween', the car Christine in 'Christine' or the zombie-like ghosts from 'The Fog'. But he is famous for his tense scenes and his dark and creepy shots as hardly any of his movies contain more than ten minutes of daylight.

The film begins in the midst of the Antarctic snowfield where a helicopter is circling an American research base chasing down a husky with a sniper. When the helicopter crashes and the pilot is killed, the passenger survives only to continue his mission of pursuing and killing the dog and in the process shots one of the members of the research team to get to the dog. The gunman who appears to be Norwegian is shot down by the captain of the base as he obviously appears to be steered crazy and incredibly dangerous.When they eventually find out that this dog isn't what it appears to be, two members of the team, one being MacReady (played by Kurt Russel who gives a fine performance here), goes on a search for the Norwegian base to see what clues they can find. When they do find the abandoned base, they find a large block of ice which looks as if something had been frozen in it for centuries and a half burnt corps that looks like something they've never seen. Of course this corps is brought back to the base, and after a few autopsies are made, one of the doctors makes the shocking discovery of a creature that imitates cells When one of the members of the base is left alone with the remains of the creature, another team member enters the room only to discover the creature is not dead and is now in fact imitating a member of the team. When help comes forth, the creature has almost finished the process and looks exactly like the team member except for a few last features. This is where the tension really begins; paranoia hits everyone and hits them hard. Did they kill the creature? Are there any remains of the creature left? If so, has it taken shape of any other team members? Who is human and who is the creature? Who can they trust? You can even feel the tension in the atmosphere of the base, the silence, the darkness, and the reactions of the team members when they suspect another team member.If one person gets out of their sight for an instant then that person is automatically a suspect. The best example of paranoia is shown by Dr. Blair played by Wilford Brimley who delivers the best performance in the film. He discovers that if this creature reaches civilization, it will eventually imitate mankind little by little and this drives him over the edge and wants no one from the base to escape for the sake of mankind. I felt quite fortunate as to have previously visited Howard Hawk's original Sci-Fi classic 'The Thing from Another World' which is quite an impressive film especially for 1951, did not feature a shape-shifting creature, instead it featured a gigantic creature that required human blood in order to reproduce. The director John Carpenter, being a fan of Howard Hawks did not try to copy the original; instead he went back to the original novel 'Who Goes There?' by John W. Campbell Jr. from 1939 which did feature a shape-shifting creature, thus making the film more tense and more suspenseful.John Carpenter has never been known for his character build up; in fact the villains in his movies are usually mindless and lack emotion or personality as shown in this film and many others such as Michael Myers in his merciless masterpiece 'Halloween', the car Christine in 'Christine' or the zombie-like ghosts from 'The Fog'. But he is famous for his tense scenes and his dark and creepy shots as hardly any of his movies contain more than ten minutes of daylight.

That was the question I kept asking myself after exiting Robert Zemeckis' latest film, What Lies Beneath. The supernatural thriller stars Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer as Norman and Claire Spencer, a successful and seemingly happy middle-aged couple whose only daughter (Katharine Towne) has just gone off to college. However, their perfect little life together doesn't last long as a result of Claire's changing mental state. The question of Claire's sanity first comes into play early on in the film as a result of Claire's obsession of spying on her new next-door neighbors, Warren & Mary Feur (Rear Window anyone?). Based on what she has seen, or rather what she thinks she has seen and the seeming disappearance of Mary, Claire begins to suspect that Warren has murdered his wife. Claire's suspicions are then taken to a new level as strange occurrences begin to happen throughout the house, ranging from doors that open on their own to the mysterious nature of the family's bathroom, which marks the location of Claire's first vision of a mysterious woman, in one of the film's more memorable scenes. Claire is nearly convinced that Mary has come back from the dead, but at the same time still aware of the possibility that it may all just be in her head. As the visions continue Claire drifts further and further away from her former self, while the relationship between her and her husband does the same. Eventually, Claire can no longer take it and must find out the truth for herself. And then the film takes its first major twist, which I won't give away but was already all but revealed in the film's trailer. The first twist is a good one and really gets the film into gear, ultimately leading to another of the film's more memorable scenes in which we see Claire seducing Norman in a manner that is very un-Claire like given her personality. The scene also includes my favorite shot in the film, which again for spoiler reasons I won't give away (pay attention to Claire's eyes in the scene and you can't miss it) and marks the beginning of the film's next major twist. And it was with this next major twist that the film first begins to fall flat. The film could have gone a number of ways given its psychological and supernatural elements, but instead plays it safe and follows the same old thriller path that we have all grown accustomed too, which just doesn't fit with the flow of the first 2\/3 of the film and is extremely disappointing given some of the possibilities that the film's first major twist hint to and could have led to. Despite the lackluster third act Zemeckis, Pfeiffer and Ford are able to pull it off reasonably well given what they have to work with as the final bathroom scenes is another of the film's best. But instead of ending it there Zemeckis can't resist himself, as an additional 15 minutes or so of film full of plenty of jump scenes follows. This period of the film is absolutely mind boggling to me, not only because it continued to remind me of how lackluster the film's third act really was, but also because the film's end result is basically the same as the result of the bathtub scene, only much, much less effective. It's a shame too, as I really did enjoy the first 2\/3 of What Lies Beneath. The film is full of very interesting shots throughout, and through the use of its score in association with some of those shots (especially anything focusing on either a mirror or water) was able to produce some genuine terror and suspense especially once the foreshadowing of these scenes has become apparent. Michelle Pfeiffer is very good in her role as Claire, as she pulls off being either scared and or unstable whenever her part called for it without ever appearing over the top. Unfortunately I can't really say the same for Ford, as the script just doesn't give him enough to work with, something that I feel weakens the film's ending even further given the path it does take. The unnecessary extension of the film, which also happened to be the only problem I had with Zemeckis' Oscar Winning film, Forrest Gump, in addition to the obvious Hitchcock visual and plot references to Psycho, Vertigo and the previously mentioned Rear Window that are laced throughout the film, and the excess and foreshadowing of jump scenes are a pretty good indication that Zemeckis was really playing around with both the thriller genre and the audience at the same time. While I enjoyed that to a certain extent, it eventually becomes tiresome, as there was just too much of it by the end of the film and because of it the film itself ultimately suffers here as well. If you're a fan of the genre itself I still recommend this film, as despite its downfalls, I still found it in parts to be more terrifying than most other so called thrillers released as of late. What Lies Beneath isn't a bad film; it isn't a very good film either, but at the same time based on its first two acts alone had the makings of being a great film. If only it had ended 15 minutes sooner and if only had it taken a chance.

But instead of ending it there Zemeckis can't resist himself, as an additional 15 minutes or so of film full of plenty of jump scenes follows. This period of the film is absolutely mind boggling to me, not only because it continued to remind me of how lackluster the film's third act really was, but also because the film's end result is basically the same as the result of the bathtub scene, only much, much less effective. It's a shame too, as I really did enjoy the first 2\/3 of What Lies Beneath. The film is full of very interesting shots throughout, and through the use of its score in association with some of those shots (especially anything focusing on either a mirror or water) was able to produce some genuine terror and suspense especially once the foreshadowing of these scenes has become apparent. Michelle Pfeiffer is very good in her role as Claire, as she pulls off being either scared and or unstable whenever her part called for it without ever appearing over the top. Unfortunately I can't really say the same for Ford, as the script just doesn't give him enough to work with, something that I feel weakens the film's ending even further given the path it does take. The unnecessary extension of the film, which also happened to be the only problem I had with Zemeckis' Oscar Winning film, Forrest Gump, in addition to the obvious Hitchcock visual and plot references to Psycho, Vertigo and the previously mentioned Rear Window that are laced throughout the film, and the excess and foreshadowing of jump scenes are a pretty good indication that Zemeckis was really playing around with both the thriller genre and the audience at the same time. While I enjoyed that to a certain extent, it eventually becomes tiresome, as there was just too much of it by the end of the film and because of it the film itself ultimately suffers here as well. If you're a fan of the genre itself I still recommend this film, as despite its downfalls, I still found it in parts to be more terrifying than most other so called thrillers released as of late. What Lies Beneath isn't a bad film; it isn't a very good film either, but at the same time based on its first two acts alone had the makings of being a great film. If only it had ended 15 minutes sooner and if only had it taken a chance.

The two (mob movies and Hollywood) have always gotten along well together from The Godfather to Goodfellas, so Get Shorty taking the humorous business angle is only a natural evolution. Starring John Travolta hot off of Pulp Fiction, it's an enjoyable film for those who love movies and those who love the mob.Get Shorty is mostly about the former. Chili Palmer (Travolta) is a loan shark\/shylock who flies out to Hollywood to collect a debt and partly to avoid his new boss, Ray Bones, the perfect jerk with a foul mouth played by Dennis Farina. In LA, Palmer meets producer Harry Zimm (Gene Hackman) and becomes fond of the movie business, offering to help Zimm get some lenders who've invested in one of his films off his back.There's some strong irony between the movie business and mob movies, e.g. Chili pitches the story of why he's out in LA as a movie idea to Zimm who thinks he's got something, but its the rock solid performances of Travolta, Hackman, Farina and Delroy Lindo that sell you on Get Shorty.Film-lovers will appreciate many references from Touch of Evil to Three Men and a Baby as the movie takes plenty of shots at the industry. Those more into the mob angle will enjoy how everyone's out to get everyone -- some for legitimate reasons, others because they want in on the movie business.

However, due to the sick child, Mrs. Brisby (Hartman) is reluctant to move.She, with the help of of bumbling crow (voiced by the late Dom DeLuise), she seeks out the advice of a mysterious, but wise old owl (voiced by the late John Carradine). The Great Owl tells her to seek the assistance of the rats.When she finds the rats, she is amazed at what she sees. They have the ability to use electricity, stolen from the farm, which a kind rat named Justin (voiced by Peter Strauss) frowns upon since stealing is wrong.She learns of the rats story, where they lived at a place called N.I.M.H., or NIMH (which is short for the National Institute of Mental Health, a real-life medical organization in the United States), and gained an increased mental ability thanks to experiments performed on them. She also learned that her late husband had his hand in the rats, and other animals, escape from NIMH.The animation is real good in this movie, and holds up almost 30 years later. Though the majority of coloring is darker colors, the scenery and characters are animated fantastically. Lighter hues are scarce in this film. The darker hues are best used with the Great Owl, whose shot mostly in shadows so that his orange-yellow-tinted eyes stand out.The characters are enhanced by the performers. Hartman made Mrs. Brisby kindhearted while in desperate need of saving her children. DeLuise made the crow a bumbling idiot, and was simply fantastic as the comedy relief.Even though the parts were probably recorded separately, the on-screen chemistry is really good in this movie. Sometimes, you forgot you were watching an animated movie depending on who was on screen with whom.The only major downfall of this movie is that the subplots of this film completely miss the mark. It is told in the movie that NIMH is interested in the rat population of the farm, but they are never seen on-screen as villains trying to recapture the rats. And the lead rat villain's (voiced by the late Paul Shenar) story of trying to take over the colony is completely relegated to a such a minor subplot, it's not even worth it. Personally, I would have tried to see the villain trying to create a stir by talking to others in the rat colony to invoke an uprising at just the right moment.Character development is fairly weak in this film. Although there is some pretty good development in the main characters, the supporting characters are a miss. I didn't understand what many of the minor characters had to do with the plot, as they were really under developed. I really couldn't tell who was needed for more than just plot advancement, and who was not needed.The music is pretty boring. I didn't even think it helped enhance the action of the scenes. I remember at the end, just as the credits begin, there is one song with lyrics. This song would never be a Top 10 smash, or a Hollywood classic. In fact, it's pretty forgettable.There is some mild violence, and one bad word in the entire movie. I might keep the Sesame Street crowd away from this movie because of these, and that the movie is not anything like a Disney movie.I can just barely recommend this movie.

She was cowering under the rim of the boat the entire night, muttering incoherently, and nearly catatonic from primal fear. I didn't think a sequel to Jaws could invoke something so relatable. That right there gets my props. The Editorial Review for this is too mean-spirited. It ain't necessarily wrong, but it just focuses on the superficial negatives.

Contrary to the above, it does have a nice style, and the photography might be the prettiest you get in the entire franchise. Why does a Jaws movie look so pretty?

The development of character and build-up of atmosphere and mood are among the best ever seen in this medium. You care about the entire crew, and they have varied personalities and every last one of them is credible. Including a reporter lets them occasionally explain something the audience needs to understand without it standing out, and apart from that, he is also someone you feel for. There are no good or bad guys in this, there are only *people*. Human beings. And you experience the terror that actual submarine crews did, as well as the filth and the claustrophobia. All without any of it getting excessive. This is intense and extremely well-paced. It manages to not overwhelm the audience to the point of over-stimulation. You don't merely witness how little room they have to move around, how two men cannot pass each other at certain parts lest they both squeeze up against the wall and move sideways, you *experience* it. If you are not OK with closed spaces, you may not want to take your chances with a viewing of this. It's exceptionally well-shot, from start to finish. The authenticity is astonishing.

There is occasional humor, to lighten the tension slightly.

This is well-made all the way, and it was the perfect decision to do it almost completely in sequence. The sound design is amazing, in a class of its own. Every acting performance is flawless, and it's no wonder that Prochnow got several American roles after this came out. The DVD offers a dub in English(by the same cast, I understand), though I chose to hear the original German. It also contains a trailer, a six minute featurette of sorts, about the DC edition, and a subtitled, highly informational and also fun commentary track with Wolfgang, Jürgen and Ortwin Freyermuth who produced this version of the film.

Most would consider The Royal Tenenbaums Wes' magnum opus thus far, and I would not be one to disagree although Rushmore is my personal favorite. Each and every character gets enough screen time for you to either love them, hate them or have a slew of very mixed-yet-strong feelings for these characters. Whether or not you like them, you care.

Wes Anderson is my favorite director because he mixes such deep, profound drama with subtle, smart humor. Sometimes just one line in his film can make you feel both humor and sorrow.

That's the question this film leaves us to ponder, though I'm not so much left pondering the somewhat facile logic of the film's conclusion as the fact that so much incredible talent was put forth for this particular story. Although I found it gripping for most of its running time, ultimately the appearance of Raymond Burr and the constrictions of the production code and its furies of justice lead to much head-scratching.George Eastman (Montgomery Clift) is a young man in search of a better life with pennies to spare he rolls into town as a passenger with a Mexican peddler, quickly wheeling a deal to work in his uncle's (Herbert Heyes) clothing factory. There he meets a rather subdued co-worker named Alice Tripp (Shelley Winters) who momentarily grabs his fancy, although his eye is continually turned towards society maven Angela Vickers (Elizabeth Taylor). Eventually he concocts a ridiculously shortsighted plan to murder the pregnant Tripp so that he can live his dream with Miss Vickers, but of course nothing goes according to plan.To me, again, the quality of the story is good but not up to the level of the performances or of George Stevens' fine direction. At the point when it devolves into a crime-and-punishment morality tale, complete with Liz Taylor making weepy prison visits, the film becomes a bore. But Clift's performance is stunning, drawing us in at times in spite of ourselves. Stevens makes use of some very interesting cinematic devices, such as inaudible dialog and overlapping fade-ins and fade-outs that seem to convey a dream-like state of the protagonist's obsession with Vickers. A scene will fade out, just for a moment fade in to Clift and Taylor in passionate embrace, and then fade in on another scene involving Clift. In one particularly disconcerting scene of this type, the fade-away momentarily involves his dour religious mother.It's from the novel An American Tragedy by Theodore Dreiser, but I'm left wondering what was distinctly American about it. Presumably it's the overbearing theme of ambition, this idea that the Clift character is just trying to live the American dream. What we can see is that in the rough outline, his story would be ugly indeed -- he knocks up the low-rent girlfriend and then tries to ditch her for a rich lifestyle. The fact that the film makes us so sympathetic to his actions can either be read as tacit acceptance of the dream or, more likely, an ironic comment on our own willingness to put much ugliness aside when it's necessary to live the life we imagine we need. Young Eastman could have reached for the stars in the first place, and he seems to be punished just as much for accepting a substitute dream in the first place as for any of the actions he might have subsequently carried out.

Horror movies talk to our most basic instinct which is fear and stimulate our numerous fears in different ways. And the good thing too is that whenever your fear is quivered, your intellect moves up in a very profound way using all the possible weapons that one could think of just for the sake of your own survival.

A depressingly underrated character study, Bad Lieutenant is truly Abel Ferrara's masterpiece, and a high point in independent cinema of the 90's.Harvey Keitel plays a New York cop who, to put it bluntly, is a pretty awful person. Throughout the film, we watch as he goes from situation to situation exploring the depths of depravity and corruption. Ferrara keeps it voyeuristic -- Keitel is often shot from a distance, and he is presented without judgment. This matter-of-fact approach to his character is what makes this film so believable, so real. Keitel is portrayed not as a monster, but as what he is -- a human. As easy as it is to hate him (and boy, is it easy), it is just as easy to forgive him -- a point which is highlighted by the religious themes and Catholic imagery throughout. And ultimately, it really is a film more concerned with forgiveness and redemption than power and corruption. All of the evils perpetrated by our protagonist build over the course of 90 minutes and lead to a final act of humanity. He is not necessarily vindicated, but he is most certainly human.It's not a feel-good film, and it's unpleasantness is not always easy to endure, but Bad Lieutenant is a powerful, rewarding film experience. One of the absolute best of its kind. 9 out of 10.

That was months ago, when I was back home in Honduras, now I'm a year in Finland and I'm enjoying the selection of movies at the local library. And the best? Rent's all for free!At first I had trouble with translations and checking for subtitles, but then I found this movie and didn't doubt in taking it. The Treasure of Sierra Madre tells us the story of two American beggars living in a Mexican city, and how they embark in an adventure in search of gold, where they find the wilderness, bandits, an uninvited guest and the terrible greed for gold, which is the movie's main theme.How can human economy be based on something which is not even edible? Gold is useless, but for what it means in our society, it can turn people crazy. As the movie unfolds we watch how the usually heroic Boggart succumbs to his own greed, in contrast to Curtin and the old man.Casting and performances are terrific. Boggart is on his best shape and Tim Holt is on the same level, as well as the Academy Award performance Walter Huston, whose son also won two very well deserved Oscars, for the movie keeps you thrilled throughout its running time and the location filming at Mexico, was a great choice. The town scenes are very tasty and give us the American view of Mexico on the late 1940s, which tends to be stereotypical but portraying both the bandit Zapatist revolutionary and the common good faithed village people.The Treasure of Sierra MAdre is definitely a treasure you should find, in case you haven't discovered it yet.

Director John Huston fires his dialogue rapidly, his sets are resolutely claustrophobic, his plot impenetrable and his characters all existing within a mass of hazy motivations, unspoken schemes and sinister intentions. The very cinematic language of Huston's film was oppressive, every detail, word and object actively working against the viewer.And of course it is up to our intrepid avatar, Humphrey Bogart, to cutlass his way through this conspiratorial web. Through him we hack and we slash, peeling back the layers, trying to get at some truth. Whether we get there or not is unimportant. Noir's joy is this getting tangled within a spider web of fate. And maybe even asserting a little control and pulling ourselves back out.Regardless, Humphrey Bogart is always a joy to watch. Whether he's playing Sam Spade in The Maltese Falcon or Philip Marlowe in The Big Sleep, Bogart always brings the right mixture of cynicism, wit and toughness. He also always manages to look effortlessly cool.A great film noir is an almost tactile thing. Like reading a good Chandler, Thompson or Connelly novel, noir immerses you in a world that is as thick as it is black. The Maltese Falcon may not have the technical wizardry or scope of later film noirs, but it has a purity and immediacy that most of those films lack. It's also filled with little details that would immediately prove archetypal. The clothes, the cigarettes, the villains, the staccato dialogue, would all help shape the genre for future films. Even the film's final shot would be aped in Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, both films ending with an elevator door abruptly shutting.What's also interesting is observing how noir has expanded as the decades have rolled by. In the 40s and 50s directors like Hawks and Huston gave us noirs confined to tiny rooms, their characters battling their way from one small sound-stage to the next. Nowadays noirs have the expansiveness of The X Files or The Wire, their characters at the mercy of a far wider-range of forces (politics, science, sex, religion, money, mysticism, Hollywood, genetics, technology, screenwriters, family, fate, bureaucracy etc). The best modern noirs take place in a forever un-mappable universe, their heroes increasingly lost, set adrift in a world of conspiratorial influences so vast that the human mind can do nothing but succumb. True noirs of today can be thus found in films as widely divergent as Ran, Inland Empire, Mulholland Drive, The Wire, Code 46, Boarding Gate, Eyes Wide Shut, etc etc. Of course nobody thinks of these films as film noirs. They much rather champion self consciously emulative fare like Blood Simple, Fargo, Brick, LA Confidential or Red Rock West. But these are all retrograde noirs, nostalgic, content to ape convention rather than explore the world as better directors do. They reduce noir to a aesthetic choice, a kind of chic, designer existentialism, rather than anything more socially, psychologically or philosophically meaningful.Noirs almost always end with a downbeat ending, but The Maltese Falcon's is remarkably relentless. The falcon turns out to be fake, the bad guys realise they've wasted half their lives tracking it down, everyone loses money, Marlowe isn't paid and the femme fatale is subjected to a searing monologue in which Marlowe weighs the pros and cons of turning her in. It's all very harsh.10\/10 &#x96; A great film, every bit as juicy today as it was over half a century ago. Worth multiple viewings.
