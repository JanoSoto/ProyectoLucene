Amassing box office numbers never before even imagined, Star Wars was truly becoming a massive part of American culture very, very quickly. With brilliant writing, casting, direction, and also a good dose of fun, Star Wars is hands-down one of the top movies of all time. It was expected to sweep the Oscars that year. But, the film would be overshadowed at the Oscars by the quiet film Annie Hall. Annie Hall put Woody Allen on the map and made him a star. The film would also launch the career of Diane Keaton. Using a very unique form of storytelling that would become perfected by Quinten Tarantino, Annie Hall is totally not the average love story, for many many reasons.But, just because of it being a different kind of film, it does not make it any more entertaining. Annie Hall is charming, it does have a few laughs, but it is nowhere near the greatest film of all time. It is not worthy of the Best Picture Oscar, nor is it worthy of being listed as a true classic. Instead, the film should just be accepted as one of the more groundbreaking filming achievements of the 1970s, and nothing more. Woody Allen's one-joke film (the entire film focuses around the bizarre personality of the main character) clocks in at a decent amount of time and offers a realistic bittersweet ending, but seems to lack that punch that truly makes it a standout film.The story revolves around a very nervous and neurotic comedian by the name of Alvy Singer who falls in love with this interesting and pretty singer Annie Hall. Throughout the film, you see the ups and downs of the relationships, and also get glimpses into the pasts of both people in order to get an idea as to why they are the way they are, and why they have so much chemistry together. The best part of this movie is the chemistry Allen and Keaton have. When they are together, you can sense the love and care thy have for each other. Both performances were excellent; they truly were the ones carrying the film. Everyone else in the film really carried no weight and are totally forgettable characters, besides Christopher Walken's character, which shared a very funny moment with Woody Allen.Annie Hall denies the fact that there is a fourth wall, as the film has the main character talking to the audience. This is not the only bizarre element of the film. The movie has many things that prior to being released, had not been witnessed before, which included the thoughts of two people talking to each other as they engaged in conversation, also has tons of flashbacks and moments in which the main characters interact with their past counterparts. All these little unique moments throughout the movie make this movie very fresh, very different from the average romantic comedy. While these little things do enhance the experience a little, it fails to save the movie from at times being a bit boring or a bit tedious. There is just way too much time in between laughs.The humor is at times a bit dry, which could be another reason why it appealed to so many but did not appeal much to me. I personally thought Napoleon Dynamite was the worst comedy within the past three decades. Annie Hall is no Napoleon Dynamite mind you, but it still lacks that edge that the better romantic comedies contain, comedies like The 40-year-Old Virgin, When Harry Met Sally, Pretty Woman, and There's Something About Mary.Bottom Line Annie Hall is not worthy of having that Best Picture Oscar; it should have gone to Star Wars for sure. I have never found Woody Allen that funny, and I did not really see what was the big deal about this film. It is just an average, mediocre love story told in a very unique way. While paving the way for interesting movie making from Robert Rodriguez, Quinten Tarantino, and others, Annie Hall is an experimental film that appeals to some, while failing to appeal to others. This is not the romantic comedy classic that everyone makes it out to be. Annie Hall superb performances barred by many slow and dull moments and boring situations, not a classic in my standards.Score 4\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"18 December 2005","score":"16 out of 30 people found the following review useful","review":" Back in 1977 Star Wars was conquering the entire world.

The hype surrounding it, the overuse of Rhett's infamous line in pop culture, and the fact that most people rave about this being one of the most romantic films ever produced set my standards extremely high. I wanted to be blown away by the scenes, I wanted characters that would invite me into their worlds and never make me leave, I wanted tragedy on a grand scale, but alas, that wasn't what I witnessed with Gone with the Wind. Somehow I ending this film with a sense of astonishment, a sense of being robbed, and not at all the romantic film I thought I would be enjoying. Instead I saw hatred, sexism, racism, alcoholism, anti-love, pro-Confederacy, and ignorance all rolled up together into a two-disc packaging, which would be later called Gone with the Wind. It was embarrassing to watch and call as one of our greatest love stories ever. While it may show us what society was like during a pre-Civil War era, that doesn't mean we have to condone it and embrace it.I realize that the point of this film was to show us a different side of the war. That all Southerners were not fueled by hatred and surrounded by a violent slavery system. Instead, there was quite a bit of beauty to the old South. A sense of pride, a sense of gentlemanly nature, and a sense of honor, which was difficult to witness being trampled on as the North continued its destructive war path. In that sense, I think it gave us a glimpse of what we lost with the Civil War. That image of the South was beautifully captured in this film. This film gives us some of the most beautiful sights of lavish plantations, beautiful greens, and civilized parties. The technical aspects of this film are astonishing. While I will agree with most that a widescreen version of this film may have swayed me to giving it one more star, the full screen still demonstrated the amazing sights of the South. The wide shots of the mansions, the bustling Atlanta area, and terror\/tragedy of war was beautifully captured in this film. For that, I cannot fault this film, but what I can fault it for are the stereotypes, the shallow characters, and the faded ending that just didn't seem to match the overall tone of the film.To begin, the stereotypes. While most will say that the stereotypes in this film accurately depict the voice of the South, I just didn't feel comfortable watching it in today's society. I realize that this was made back in 1938, but I still didn't feel comfortable with slavery, sexism, and ignorance surrounding these characters. Does that make this film dated? Perhaps if I witnessed our characters going through some form of change I would have softened a bit, but I did not see that at all. With the continual struggles that minorities have in cinema today, is it wise to continue to think of this film as a masterpiece of cinema? Is it worth of all the accolades that it received? No. In fact, I am surprised that this film hasn't been shunned by a majority of communities during each release. This is a pinnacle example of what obstacles African Americans are trying to overcome in today's Hollywood.There are those that speak so highly of Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh's chemistry, but for me, it was non-existent. I did not see why there are those that fall over this film and praise the story. I thought that Leigh was horrid as the early Southerner turned feminist. Gable was so inconsistent with his character that I didn't know whether to love him or hate him. There was no chemistry or connection between Leigh and Gable. They were together because the director (which this film eventually went through three of them) knew that audiences would want to see them either together or going to get together by the end. The rest of it was just trivial. With the fuzzy direction of Leigh's character, you never quite felt that Scarlett had an ounce of passion in her heart. She wanted what she couldn't have, like a spoiled child, and that was reflected again with the inconsistent ending. Gable's character of Rhett was underdeveloped. We knew nothing about this man except that he randomly continued to jump in and out of Scarlett's life. Where did his wealth come from? What was his past? Who knows &#133; and none of it was fully explained. This can be said the same with Ashley. Who was this guy? Why did Scarlett choose him over the other possible suitors? Was it simply because she couldn't have him, or because of some darker reason? Did anyone else notice that she was Irish, not quite the Southern belle that we had originally hoped for? Overall, these characters hurt and built upon the ultimate downfall of this film. They were forgettable from the first time that we met them until the very end of the film. Underdeveloped, unintelligent, and downright dull. All elements that gave us too long of a film centered on nothing.Overall, I just didn't see what all the hype was surrounding this film. Our society has moved forward from this period, but do we need to be reminded of it continually by giving this film more and more accolades? I don't think so. I do not wish to see this film again and hope that it does not continue to be a staple of our cinematic society. From the unexciting, unloving characters (of which we all hate, yet are supposed to love by the end) to smile on Scarlett's face after the marital rape scene, this movie was a disaster.Grade ** out of ***** ","genre":null},{"date":"18 December 2005","score":"8 out of 18 people found the following review useful","review":" While most will argue with me, I must begin by saying that I was not impressed with the overall final results of this epic.

Connery isn't alone in making this film as good as it is as both Rob Brown and F. Murray Abraham perform excellently in the film. The third character that makes this film as good as it is, is the story which is extremely well put together.As you have probably gathered from what I have written above I really enjoy the acting in this film. Connery doesn't appear for quite some time but when he finally does appear you get the feeling from his first scene that what you are about to see is not a typical Connery performance. His performance has the usual Connery traits. He brings his usual indescribable something to the character which becomes almost instantly likable. He is also a teacher character which he is in many of his films. Where the character truly differs from many of his previous roles is the emotional involvement which is almost awe inspiring. It really is quite a sight watching Connery struggle with his demons from the past while at the same time mellowing out to Rob Brown's character. His overall line delivery and presence is excellent and his experience really shows. In short Connery is great. Rob Brown does an excellent job as well. You can feel that this is his first film in the fact that he has a little difficulty with complex emotions but his performance and especially his scenes with Connery work great. F. Murray Abraham is thoroughly despicable in his character and he serves his purpose beautifully. Anna Paquin appears in the film as well. She isn't great but she is definitely good. Her relationship with Brown's character isn't always plausible but overall she does a good job.The story is aside from being very well told brilliantly paced. There are basically no boring scenes because of the pacing. The editing is sometimes a bit rough but nothing serious and it certainly does not lessen the value of the film. The story is both heart warming and intelligent and the dialog is also very well written. I dare you to watch the film and not be moved by the story.

It's an action film making fun of action films. The first few minutes of it are so intense, exciting and entertaining that it's really a pity that the film moves so slowly for most of the film, whenever there's not an actual action scene. Not long after said first scene, the film slows down to a very slow pace... it gets worse around the middle point, at which almost all interest is lost, all humor and entertainment fades and becomes a far too distant memory. Luckily, not long after, for the last half of the film, it picks up in pace, and there's barely one dull second after the long period of slow pace. The plot is somewhat original, though it's full of typical action-movie clichés(undoubtedly intentionally). The pacing is off for a fourth of the movie, around the middle, but apart from that, it's right on, all the time. The acting is quite good, I didn't find one single performance to be objectionable. The characters are all caricatures, which is obviously the point. The humor almost always works, mainly because it's making fun of generic action films, which have definitely had it coming for at least a few decades. The timing is spot-on, and the delivery has the sense of irony that is necessary for a film spoofing films of its kind. This is the Scream of action films, people. The action is grand; the stunts, the shots, the style... very impressive. The writing is great, Ben Ramsey really has a sense of irony, humor and good story. I suggest you also check out his other movie, Love and a Bullet, which he himself directed. It's almost as good as this. The direction is superb; apart from the pacing around the middle, it's perfect for this kind of film. All in all, a very entertaining flick(but just that, a flick... nothing more, nothing less) with a few shortcomings. Well worth watching.

He makes movies just like I've always wanted them to be! Mulholland Drive is one of Lynch's best...right up there with my other Lynch favourites, Lost Highway and Eraserhead.However, like all his other works, this will appeal only to a few people who are ready to accept such movies. People looking for conventional, fast paced entertainers, will be disappointed.Saying anything about the plot would mean giving most of the story away, but I shall roughly state that it is about a girl called Betty (Naomi Watts) who arrives in Hollywood to star in the movies. She meets Laura Harring who has lost her memory because of a car accident.Mulholland Drive is a work of art. The cinematography is excellent. The plot is complex, but it all falls into place towards the end, provided you pay attention to the finer details. It can be completely understood; if not during the first viewing, definitely in the second or the third! There are countless memorable moments, some of which haunt you and stay in your head long after the movie ends; special mention of the terrific score (composed by Angelo Badalamenti who also appears in a brief role) that complements these scenes beautifully.Naomi Watts delivers a stunning performance, which should've at least received an Oscar nomination. The gorgeous Laura Elena Harring is also very convincing in her role.David Lynch was nominated for an Oscar for Best Director during the 2001 Academy Awards for this movie.

Well it's nothing like Man on Fire, so I'll judge this movie as it stands on its own. It stands as well as any peg legged person would. The bond between Creasy and Pita was very believable, the bond between Leon and Mathilda is contrived and awkward. From the outset, I didn't buy that this little Mathilda girl has this burning passion and dedicated devotion to become a hit-man just like Leon. What little girl even thinks like that? Also, what makes her sooo interested in him anyway? I'm talking about before he rescued her, what was it about him that she was so attracted to? It makes no sense.Obviously if Mathilda didn't want to be a hit-man, we would have no movie. Had they justified this motivation in a more believable manner, I would've bought it. And no, her family being murdered (including her brother who she was close with) doesn't count. I don't buy becoming a hit-man as a believable emotional response for a 12 year old girl. If they wanted to make it realistic, they should've had her desire to be a hit-man be more of a passing interest, as sort of a passionate raw response to having her family murdered. A lot of kids show interest in whatever it is that is current in their minds at the time, but unless it's something that they are naturally interested in, or are forced to do, they probably won't follow through with the hard work and dedication it takes to succeed in some random craft thrown at them (and why should they, you think you can get a 12 year old girl to all of a sudden show daily dedication in say, becoming a car mechanic, without any persuasion to do so?) Here's what they should've done After her family is killed, have her still want to exact revenge, but what should change is her character's desire to *continue* training to be a hit-man, because that single flaw is what throws this whole premise off the balcony. I would have her eventually try to give up on this idea after realizing what a dark world she's gotten herself into, only to have Leon not allow her back out of her commitment. The manner in which Leon reacts to this and the degree to which he goes to prevent her cop out would be determined by how you would want to portray his character. There could be many interesting possibilities with this sort of idea, by showing a realistic shades of grey character.One final thing, so many people said how Gary Oldman was so great in this, and squealing with delight about how his quirky performance was just so wonderful.

Along the way Julie discovers things she did not know about her husband and she has to come to terms with her life now that her husband and daughter are gone. Winner of The CEC Award for Best Foreign Film at The Cinema Writers Circle Awards; The Cesar Award for Best Actress (Juliette Binoche who plays Julie), Best Editing and Best Sound at The Cesar Awards; The Goya Award for Best European Film at The Goya Awards; The Guild Film Award Gold for Foreign Film at The Guild of German Art House Cinemas; The Silver Ribbon for Best Female Dubbing at The Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists; The LAFCA Award for Best Music at The Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards; The Sant Jordi Award for Best Foreign Actress and Best Foreign Film at The Sant Jordi Awards and The Golden Lion (for director and co-writer Krzysztof Kieslowski), The Golden Osella for Best Cinematography and The Volpi Cup for Best Actress at The Venice Film Festival. The film has good direction, a good script, a good performance by Juliette Binoche, good original music, good film editing and good cinematography. The film's director and co-writer Krzysztof Kieslowski made this film in a trilogy of films he called the Three Colors trilogy which is followed by the films White and Red. Blue is a quiet and small film in many ways. There is not a lot of dialogue in the film and the general story is relatively simple when you first view the film, but after viewing it you will later think about it for awhile and have some questions about it. The movie is good looking and I think Juliette Binoche did a very good job expressing her emotions just by her facial expressions and mannerisms instead of using talking seeing as there isn't a lot of that in the film. The film also has a beautiful yet haunting look to it which is very artistic and stylish. Although the film is a little slow moving I was never bored with it and as it moved on I grew more and more curious about the Julie character and I really wanted to see what would happen with her at the end. There is also some neat twists and unpredictable scenes in here that I thought worked quite well too. I must also commend the film for it's great character study of Julie, a woman who is grieving and is also in a state of self discovery. The film is a small and quiet film but it is fascinating and neat to look at and also is quite a thought provoking and intelligent film.

The thing about great art is it engages the consciousness of the perceiver creatively with the same amount of energy the perceiver invests. That might sound like a lot of pseudo-babble so let me try again. What you see is what you get with great art--and this relationship happens unpretentiously. In an ideal creation there is nothing presumptuous about the art. No doubt there are moments of stereotypes, but these could be just as easily blamed on bad acting from the supporting cast, or simple lapses in composition. I don't think anyone could seriously say stereotypes are a fundamental weakness of this flick, mainly because the use of stereotypes is serving a larger purpose to the story--at least as I see it. This is probably one of the most complex, multi-layered movies I have ever seen. We witness all the archetypes of good storytelling utilized in ever-meshing ways. How sexual violence is a fetish, and how an innocent mind sees it as simple playing. And in every scene we are given, the meaning of Foster's character and what she represents grows. The ending under these terms is truly remarkable and frankly a surprise if witnessed representationally. I mean these are heavy comments on reality folks. I didn't see the play the screenplay was based on, but over and over again I kept thinking Who the hell wrote this thing? Who directed this? It is masterful, and if you can't see it that way, I don't know, go read some books on critical theory, on the development of human consciousness, on Aristotle's's poetics, etc. It is counterpoint perfection--extremely well crafted, and a powerful commentary on not only our culture and civilization, but what it means to be human in this contemporary moment. Oh yeah, Jodi Foster is outstanding. We could make a case that she and her character are the center of this movie, except that it is the world unfolding around her that makes this such great drama. I think I have to go back to her Disney-era movies to think of a truly awful movie she has made. But that shouldn't count either. I never thought those movies were all that bad, but then I simply watched them as a kid.

I don't think anyone could seriously say stereotypes are a fundamental weakness of this flick, mainly because the use of stereotypes is serving a larger purpose to the story--at least as I see it. This is probably one of the most complex, multi-layered movies I have ever seen. We witness all the archetypes of good storytelling utilized in ever-meshing ways. How sexual violence is a fetish, and how an innocent mind sees it as simple playing. And in every scene we are given, the meaning of Foster's character and what she represents grows. The ending under these terms is truly remarkable and frankly a surprise if witnessed representationally. I mean these are heavy comments on reality folks. I didn't see the play the screenplay was based on, but over and over again I kept thinking Who the hell wrote this thing? Who directed this? It is masterful, and if you can't see it that way, I don't know, go read some books on critical theory, on the development of human consciousness, on Aristotle's's poetics, etc. It is counterpoint perfection--extremely well crafted, and a powerful commentary on not only our culture and civilization, but what it means to be human in this contemporary moment. Oh yeah, Jodi Foster is outstanding. We could make a case that she and her character are the center of this movie, except that it is the world unfolding around her that makes this such great drama. I think I have to go back to her Disney-era movies to think of a truly awful movie she has made. But that shouldn't count either. I never thought those movies were all that bad, but then I simply watched them as a kid.

The thing about great art is it engages the consciousness of the perceiver creatively with the same amount of energy the perceiver invests. That might sound like a lot of pseudo-babble so let me try again. What you see is what you get with great art--and this relationship happens unpretentiously.

But the cinematography is quite well done. And the story is a reasonably good rendering of a complex historical issue. I do not currently have it in my collection but I hope to add it soon. However the soundtrack has never been far from my CD player (now perma-loaded on my ipod). It's been years since I last saw the film yet many of the details of the film are still vivid in my mind. While there are a few films which I like on an equal level, I am hard pressed to think of a film better than The Mission. I would place it on my list of top 20 movies for a well rounded individual to have seen, and certainly think anyone interested in quality though provoking films would enjoy this one.

I gained a new respect for Costner after seeing this movie. He's always good as baseball players and cowboys, but this character is really a perfect fit for Costner. Combines all the elements that add up to a great Costner performance humor (Crash Davis from Bull Durham)+ dark violence seething under the surface (Charly from Open Range)+ Child-like enthusiasm (Ray Cansella from Field of Dreams). Severely underrated, A Perfect World stands right up there Eastwood's best behind the camera achievements. And in case you haven't figured this out yet; Eastwood is the man, so do yourself a favor and check this movie out.
