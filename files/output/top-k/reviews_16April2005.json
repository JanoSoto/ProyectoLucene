To be fair, while I like Field of Dreams and Bull Durham, I know that I would have been more receptive initially if this wasn't another movie about America's Favorite Pastime, but I have to admit that this is probably my favorite of the three.This is less a baseball movie than a movie about a baseball player. While the movie prominently features a baseball game (perhaps the last in Billy Chapel's storied career), it is much more about Chapel looking back on his long career, and especially his love affair with Jane Aubrey, a magazine writer that he stumbles into one day while in New York.As the movie opens, it's the end of a losing season. Chapel finds himself in the worst day of his life his team is about to be sold and he is about to be traded from the only team he has ever played for. To compound things, his longtime girlfriend tells him that she can't handle being the second priority in his life behind baseball. So as he takes the mound in the last game of the season, and perhaps the last of his career, realizing that his whole life is about to change, he spends the time thinking about his relationship with Jane. And on this day when nothing else is perfect, maybe Billy can salvage something from his life before the day is through.This movie also surprised me for a few other reasons. Sam Raimi, the director, is better known for his Spider-Man movies, which he made later, and for his Evil Dead movies. He leaves behind his action sequences for this touching film about life and relationships. What surprised me more was that the film was based on a story by Michael Shaara, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Killer Angels, which should be required reading for all courses dealing with the Civil War (and which was made into the film Gettysburg). The manuscript was found in his desk after he died, and published posthumously.Having read the book, and seen the movie, it is clearly a labor of love. Costner, Raimi, and Shaara clearly love the game of baseball, and yet all three recognize that there are more important things in life than a game.

Hal lives a very, very picky love life, thinking he should\/could have it all, until one day he encounters a famous love guru who hypnotizes him.Hal believes the hypnosis is going to make him funnier, cooler, and more confident, thus giving him all the girls he wants. Which is exactly what it seems to do at first, as he goes dating some of the hottest hotties in town, which of course everyone (especially himself!) find very strange. But as the story goes on and he meets the perfect, beautiful, smart Rosemary (Gwyneth Paltrow), it becomes more and more obvious to the watcher as well as Hal's buddies that Shallow Hal's gals are...well...not that hot.The Farrely brothers, infamous for movies like Me, Myself and Irene, have created a surprisingly not-over-the-top-gross movie, judging from their standards. The make-up for the over-weights appearing throughout the movie (especially Gwyneth Paltrow's M-U) is very convincing, but is never used in an overly gross way, and the dates' defects are never graphic but merely implied to the watcher. Only at some times is the sensitive subject of overweight used to produce laughs, and luckily, it becomes GOOD jokes, and not overly offensive to real over-weights.Overall it is a potentially sweet movie as soon as it gets past a rather slow beginning, but don't expect an outrageous laugh-fest because this is a rather cuddly movie about getting past being superficial, and finding the true beauty of people. Jack Black is funny in the lead, Gwyneth Paltrow is very beautiful as Hal's vision of the inside Rosemary, and in a supporting role we see Jason Alexander as another superficial guy who turns out to have a slight problem of his own. The acting is, as expected, not worthy of half an Oscar, but the Academy is a bit of a joke, anyway, nowadays, and they make good roles through the movie.What should be nominated for some kind of price, anyway, is the whole story. It is a rather original one, a sweet, everyone-wins story, but not unfunny at all because of this and definitely worth seeing anyway. Shallow Hal is probably not like much else you've seen around comedy, and the Farrelys have scored high despite unfunny stuff like M,M&I. ***\/**** ","genre":null},{"date":"16 April 2005","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Jack Black plays picky, not-that-attractive, and overly superficial Hal, whose father's last wish was that he went for the hot, young, perfectly shaped chicks.

Plain and simple, this film is just straight up bad ass.

He'll have his good moments (A Better Tomorrow, The Killer), and his bad (Windtalkers, Hard Target). He just doesn't know what script to pick and choose... but with Face\/Off, he succeeded immensely.It really does have everything that you would want in an action movie... in any movie in really. Once you pop this in, you know what's expected Action\/Thriller... but what's not expected are the other elements that keep you coming back for more.What Woo added in this is the dramatic factor... you actually CARE about these characters. You feel pain for Sean Archer and his wife and you want him to get his revenge. You want him to win so bad against this egotistical and demented Castor Troy that you bite down on your popcorn harder to see if he gets his just desserts... but that's what brings you to the other element...Woo also added another layer of content that is so vital, yet so fun... which is that it is also a Dark-Comedy. Not like other action movies where they give you a one-liner that brings a smile to your face after the protagonist says something ironic after a mundane moment of a thrilling action sequence that has just happened, but you actually laugh out loud at some moments. That's why you also connect with Castor Troy. He's a devilish man, but sometimes he can be likable (in very few moments, mind you, he's still a horrible guy).These reasons are why this film excels above and beyond the tagging of just another Action\/Thriller.All of this brought together by Woo's great direction action sequences, great acting, and a pretty good score to boot, you will find yourself on the edge of your seat waiting to see what happens next.I really do recommend that everyone see this film. Whether you are an indie kid looking for solace out of a film, or are just an average movie-goer looking for a dumb-fun movie, this is the film that everyone needs to view at least once.

The ordinary anti-war movie typically gives us plenty of blood and intestines to show us how awful war is -- and then at the end, we win. Nobody really wins here, although I guess two French officers escape from the German POW camp successfully and reach Switzerland. But this film gives us no battles, no gore, only one death, and no long speeches about how fruitless it all is.There are four principal actors -- Gabin, Dalio, Fresnay, and von Stroheim (who picked up his von from the same place Claus von Bulow got his). Gabin has big eyes and a homely face that seems made of putty. Fresnay projects aristocracy and good breeding. Dalio is Rosenthal, the Jewish French lieutenant. He speaks German with a Yiddish accent, like James Cagney did. Dalio was in a number of French movies that have become classics of their kind then, barely escaping the Nazis, came to Hollywood where he played in three movies made from Hemingway stories, leading to his apotheosis on the silver screen as the gay interior decorator in Pillow Talk. The grand illusion in the title comes from an exchange between Gabin and Dalio as they are crossing the German countryside in civilian clothes. Gabin says, I don't know who will win this war but let's hope it is the last, and Dalio dismisses the hope as an illusion. History has come down on Dalio's side. As Santayana put it, only the dead have seen the end of war. The film takes a trajectory from amusing to tragic, involving several POW plot touchstones -- the digging of the tunnel, the musical show in which prisoners dress up as girls, the hidden contraband in the barracks. The comedy is pretty good sometimes. The Russian prisoners receive a big box, a present from the Tsaritsa. Caviar and booze! They invite the French and English prisoners to the coming feast, but when they break open the crate it's full of books -- Introduction to Grammar, Elements of Philosophy. They are so enraged they set fire to the box and its contents and brawl with the guards. The Russian aristocracy might have avoided revolution if they'd understood the needs of the common man.The saddest part is near the end, when Gabin and Dalio take shelter in a farmhouse with a German widow and her young daughter. The widow is plain looking, young but not too young, and blond, and she's lost all the men in her family to the war. The little girl, Charlotte, is trusting but not cute. Over time Gabin and the widow fall in love. He teaches her a bit of French and she teaches him a little German -- Lotte hat blaue Augen. It's all very understated. No one weeps when Gabin and Dalio leave, except perhaps the viewer. I'm moved every time I see it, enveloped in a loathsome sentiment. It's well worth watching, if only for Eric von Stroheim's performance as the major in charge of the prisoner's castle. He is an aristocrat and so is one of the French prisoners, Fresnay. Von Stroheim treats Fresnay with masculine affection, like the geranium he cultivates in his stone fortress. The two aristocrats know their time has come, that the world belongs to commoners like Gabin and Dalio. They're like the gunfighters or gangs of the disappearing Old West, unable to adjust to the changes. Fresnay is philosophical about it. Von Stroheim regrets having only been severely wounded and not killed outright. That monocle! Those braces on his neck! The cigarette holder! And I swear that he speaks French with an American accent! See the major click his heels and bow. See him drape his greatcoat over his shoulders like a cape. See the movie!

After that, we see Ronna and her life for about half an hour. Later on, we see Simon, the British guy who gives Ronna his shift. He goes to Vegas and has a different adventure with his friends. By this time the movie is linking together, and the viewer is understanding better. After Simon makes his way home, we see Adam & Zack's situation. As this goes on, more and more linking comes together. By the end, all four people (three different perspectives) come together for one last twist.This movie must have taken months to arrange the plot so perfectly. The idea of having three points-of-view to be linked together this well is mind blowing. 9 out of 10 stars. This movie has everything you need sex, nudity, drug use, drug selling, vulgarity, comedy, fire, strip clubs, threesomes... it just adds up to perfection. Excellent, excellent movie.

Reporter John Garrett who works for a National Enquirer like magazine, arrives in Hemmingford Nebraska with his teenage son whom he is trying to get along with, in order to write an article of the Gatlin massacre of the first film. He then meets native American anthropology Professor RED BEAR, who shows John a drawing by his native ancestors that tells of a spirit possessing children to turn against their parents when the adults go to far in polluting the land. Unfortunately for John & those people of Hemmingford that took the surviving cult members into their homes to raise them, the kids are still determined to worship He who walks behind the rows & gather at the site of the first films massacre to figure out what to do, since both their leaders are dead. At the same time, teen Micah is travelling through the fields at night looking for the rest of the kids (why is never answered). However it turns out that the spirit that the hero's of the previous film thought was dead is very much alive yet in these fields & chases down Micah possessing him, whereupon he steps into the role of leadership from Isaac & his right hand man Malachai. Picking up where they left off, the children begin to slaughter the Hemmingford residents one by one & eventually set their sights on Danny to join them. Sequels are rarely better than their original outing, but occasionally a sequel will come along that either surpasses the original, or comes very close to it, such is the case with CHILDREN OF THE CORN II THE FINAL SACRIFICE, which is a highly enjoyable continuation of the original film! In many ways I somewhat prefer CHILDREN OF THE CORN II to the original, at least in terms of story & special effects, it's a better movie. The gore is plentiful here & the kills are pretty creative, such as a person who dies from what has to be the worst nose bleed in history. A doctor stabbed to death with needles, a victim has their own house fall on top of them, a wheelchair bound victim is tossed through a plate glass window, when her wheelchair gets controlled by a remote control device, a throat slit with corn stem & a husk through the throat. All courtesy of HELLRAISER 1-3 special effects artist BOB KEEN. In terms of it's story, the plot is really none to different, in fact the film- makers (many of whom worked on HELLRAISER III) have taken the route that so many film-makers take when creating a sequel, create the same story, but yet add something new to it, to make it different from it's predecessor. In this case, the film offers up a few interesting idea's & subplots with two reasons why all of this might be happening, such as an native American spirit rising from the earth to possess children, driving them to slaughter the adults due to their mistreatment of the land & the other being poisonous dust off toxic corn, that the sneaky resident of Hemmingford (led by the local sheriff) is hiding in a barn, with the dust having blown over the fields & into the town of Gatlin, which may or may not have been the cause of the massacre in the first place, since the children inhaling it would go insane. Not surprisingly, in the end it's revealed that the reason for the massacre is purely supernatural & a father & son constantly being at each pother's throats & trying to work things out between the two of them & the after mentioned subplots about native American spirits possessing children & toxic dust off old corn that the townsfolk are tied up in & I really liked the direction David F. Price took this film in. The film was never boring & that's mainly because he knew what horror fans were looking for in their horror movies & delivers all expectations on a silver platter. The killings here are rather inventive & oddly funny, such as when an elderly lady gets killed by having her house, that has been jacked up to be moved to another town, fall on top of her & her shouting What a world, what a world! her wheelchair bound twin sister, being hit by a truck & tossed through a window, at the same time a guy wins on a bingo card & he takes cover & then getting up says Bingo? a doctor stabbed to death all over with needles, while a little girls talking doll says things like My mommy say's I'm smart We like to play & then after he has been murdered, the kids take a lollipop each & then put one in his mouth before leaving. Apart from that, the film is really just an extension of the originals plot. Easily the best sequel to all of the Corn outings that came out after the first & makes for a nice companion piece to the original film. Highly recommended to fans of the first. This sequel is a lot of fun & highly entertaining. A real fun film for horror fans. Only a silly romantic teen subplot that add nothing to the films story, between the hero's son & a local girl, brings down the film. Other than that, this film is nicely done.

She is playing another dame, Iris Murdoch. I would have loved if they focused the film somewhat on Iris' success. She won the Booker Prize for the Sea, the Sea. She was awarded Commander of the British Empire and a Dame in 1987, a year before Judi's honor. Judi Dench really pours her heart and soul in this role and it shows. Jim Broadbent who declined a Queen's honor in reality is brilliant in his role as the older John Bayley. Their relationship is quite enduring. They focus too much on Iris' early sexuality as a way to maybe attract attention of film goers to go and see this film. If they did withhold it, it would have been seen on Masterpiece Theatre. I read two of Iris' books, The Bell and The Sea, The Sea. They are both philosophical, intelligent products of fiction. John is absolutely right when he says that Iris lives for words and they are her life. The scenes with the older Iris and John are more important than the younger versions of themselves. I think there was a creative difference in depicting Iris as free-thinking, smoking, young lady rather than the mature, intelligent, private woman of her day. The film is a 10 because of Dench and Broadbent's performances. I liked seeing Penelope Wilton play the older Janet Stone, her longtime friend. One of the subjects that I wished they would explore would have been Iris and John's decision not to have any children. The film also withholds Iris' platonic relationship with Jean-Paul Sartre. Iris and John loved swimming and that was evident in this film. I would have liked to have seen their wedding ceremony. I am not much of a Kate Winslet fan so I never really cared to see her playing younger Iris as a silly, manipulative schoolgirl. I found her Iris to be too selfish. Dench's Iris was much more caring and loving toward John and Janet. Somebody wrote that we can learn a lot about relationships by being more like John and Iris. That is so true. They were really soul mates from the beginning of their relationship and in the end too. John and Iris worked because they allowed the other live and do with absolute trust. Most people are unaware that they lived in squalid conditions in Oxford and that they did not have a television until Iris' illness. They listened to the Archers' radio program on BBC. They lived quietly. Iris donated much of her income from books to charities. When this film came out, I learned about Dame Iris Murdoch and read about her. I am still fascinated by her even watching Judi play as she declined away. Iris said about losing your mind when you live in your mind. If we all lived in our minds, it would be a much happier world.

They were really soul mates from the beginning of their relationship and in the end too. John and Iris worked because they allowed the other live and do with absolute trust. Most people are unaware that they lived in squalid conditions in Oxford and that they did not have a television until Iris' illness. They listened to the Archers' radio program on BBC. They lived quietly. Iris donated much of her income from books to charities. When this film came out, I learned about Dame Iris Murdoch and read about her. I am still fascinated by her even watching Judi play as she declined away. Iris said about losing your mind when you live in your mind. If we all lived in our minds, it would be a much happier world. Rest in peace, Dame Iris Murdoch, you are not forgotten. If this film does anything, it is promote interests in your novels and open our minds.

I knew that it was not going to be a ha ha laugh riot all the way through, but I found myself chuckling several times in the movie. This movie has an excellent storyline about an aging performer who knows he is not marketable anymore but wants one more chance to shine. He meets a ballet dancer, played wonderfully by Claire Bloom, who almost commits suicide before beings rescued by Chaplin's Calvero character. Throughout the 2 1\/2 hours, they teach other to fight their demons and do what they love doing. This movie was so moving to me. I ended up crying the majority of the movie. This shows that Chaplin is a genius. You can watch his movies and laugh, cry, think. But at the same time, it's just genius work. Sadly, this was Chaplin's last film success in America. What a shame. Great talent. The Chaplin\/Keaton sequence is the highlight of the whole movie. 2 great comedy geniuses working for one time only. Perfect. 10 out of 10. Go see Limelight and see for yourself.

The movie did a good job making this simple day a good memory. A good memory includes not only romantic feelings about a beautiful stranger and a beautiful European city, but definitely about the deeper discussion about their values of life. Many movies are like this in terms of discussion of the definitions of life or love or relationships or current problems in life or some sort of those. Before Sunrise dealt with it in a nice way, which makes the viewer pause and think and adjust her breath and go on watching the film. Before Sunrise did not try to instill a specific thought into your head. It just encouraged you to think about some issues in daily life and gave you some alternative possibilities. This made the conversations between the characters interesting, not just typical whining complaints or flowing dumb ideas. You would be still thinking about those issues for yourself and curious about the next line of the story. The end was not quite important after all. You could got something out of it and feel something good or positive about yourself after the movie. Movies are supposed to be enjoyable. This is an enjoyable movie and worth of your time to watch it. I am on a journey too. The movie somehow represented some part of me and answered some of my questions.

I stumbled upon it while looking for older Cameron Diaz movies, and have since tried to convert as many friends as possible to its genius! Its story is a slightly off-beat love story, whereby two Celestial Beings are sent down to Earth to unite man and woman in Holy Matromony, but that's not as easy as it might sound! What happens as a result is that Robert (McGregor) loses his job, home and girlfriend, in fairly quick succession, and so kidnaps his boss' daughter, Celine (Diaz). They, rather inevitably, grow closer, and realise that both want a life that is less ordinary than the one they are living.There are moments that are a little strange and wouldn't make sense in the real world, but, this is movie world!! So try to overlook and accept them and you'll truly love this film! The cast have to be praised as well, as everyone of them shines, there's real chemistry from the two leads, and a really experienced performance from Diaz despite being so early on in her career. Holly Hunter is amazing in it, she really delivers a stand out performance, and Maury Chaykin as Mr Johnson, from up the hill, is hilarious!

I was so tied into this epic of a movie that I told myself it was real, this wasn't a movie. It felt real, as if I was watching it in live action not just on a screen.

If Shakespeare as alive today, I think he would be very, very fond of this movie. In fact, I think he would love it and be very proud. Romeo and Juliet is a play which can be extorted in different ways to suit the directors need, Zeffirelli took this play and created a in-living- colour masterpiece.

The movie is filled with paranoia and isolation. The pace is a little slow sometime, but for the most part it moves effectively, starting at the beginning with a scene of nothing but white snow and mountains. After a moment you hear a helicopter and shooting, and suddenly a Husky comes into view, running from the people in the helicopter who are trying to kill it. I watched this movie when I was young, and seeing any kind of dog being shot at made me dislike the people in the helicopter. The dog runs to another base where he is immediately saved and the Norwegians in the helicopter meet there demise with the helicopter blowing up and one of them being shot between the eyes. I almost cheered at seeing this. However, not long after, the dog is found creeping around the base as if stalking, and suddenly alarm bells went off in my head. Something was definitely not right with this innocent looking dog, and I began to understand why those Norwegians might have been trying to kill it. Soon after we find out why, and suddenly all heck breaks loose because that innocent looking dog was really an imitation of something much worse. A thing from outer space that could imitate any living creature. I really don't have to say more, but this movie, which scared the crap out of me as a child, has some of the most gut wrenching and horrifying special effects ever. They still hold up well today and out do much of the CGI which now dominates films. Carpenter has once again shown how good he is at directing horror films, and Rob Bottin shows us more horrifying make-up effects then what he gave us in The Howling. The sad thing though is I could never warm to any of the characters. MacCready, as played by Kurt Russel, was the only one I ever really cared about. The others were very cold, almost robotic. And the way they all seemed to go off so easily knowing that they could be imitated made them a little implausible as well. Other than that, I would put this movie in my top 15 horror films.

He's right, too, and it's a pity, because this film production of the classic play is in desperate need of some action.As a play and on the page, Our Town is a challenging mixture of existential angst and cracker-barrel whimsy, taking the age-old question of what it all means and transplanting it to a Norman Rockwell setting. It's hard not to be moved by Thornton Wilder's story; even a high-school production can't help but feel somehow tragic and poignant with teenagers dressing up as old men and women. You can hear those voices from the graveyard Soon enough now...But on screen, the film feels hollow and constricted, very quaint and boring as it zeroes in on the routine goings-on of a rural New Hampshire hamlet as if it were some Homeric epic by way of Frank Capra. I'm sorry, but the romance of George Gibbs and Emily Webb is not exactly exciting stuff. He loves her, she loves him, and they get married. Big deal.The film does some interesting things, narrative tricks taken from the stage. Craven's Stage Manager walks in and out of the scene, narrating the story and telling characters to start talking and be quiet. At one point, he solicits questions from the audience. This all comes off very well on stage, where the physical reality of the performance is not in question. On film, though, it seems an intrusion.The performances are all good, with one glaring exception. Interestingly, the one exception is from the biggest name in the cast, William Holden, who plays George. Ugh! Even in 1940, he looked way too old to play a teenager, and simpers through his big scene in the pharmacy with Emily. His quivering characterization is a distraction throughout the movie, nowhere more unpleasantly then in an early scene when his father upbraids him about not helping Ma chop wood. The way Holden as George breaks down, you'd think Daddy found a crateful of smack under his bed. Holden is so good in other roles; it's a shock how bad he is here Innocence did not become him.Martha Scott does much better as Emily. She's quite beautiful, and plays her more complicated role with a great deal of charm and conviction. The Academy made the right choice nominating her for an Oscar. Yes, she's melodramatic, but that's what the script calls for.There are good scenes and moments throughout the film. One conversation between George and his soon-to-be father-in-law about taking the upper hand in a matrimonial relationship is pretty funny, and there are other moments that qualify as nice. I like one scene between Emily and her mother, right after Emily and George have had one of their halting conversations. The mother, played by Beulah Bondi, is watching them through a window and there's a tiny moment where we can see on her face that she clearly approves of the match, but when Emily comes in with questions about whether she's beautiful, her mother gets quickly flustered and throws up her hands. You're pretty enough for all normal purposes, the lady huffs, and that's that.Great Aaron Copland score, and I don't really mind the change to the ending so much. Wilder himself said that film, being a different medium than the stage, required different handling, and I think he got the central message across just as well. Plus he gave those folks at Dallas an idea about how they could resurrect Bobby Ewing.But Our Town doesn't work for me as a film. Thornton Wilder provided us in the 1940s with a wonderful cinematic examination of small-town life; but that was his collaboration with Alfred Hitchcock, the great Shadow Of A Doubt. This doesn't stand the test of time nearly as well. Watch it if you must for Martha Scott, but you're better off seeing it at your local high school.

Hitchcock is at his most extreme stilted and improbable story line, red herrings, unresolved scene endings, deliberately severed suspense, demeaning and downbeat character portrayals, and a totally cynical and uncompromising ending. Hitchcock of the least Hollywood kind, as one critic put it.Being from California, I do enjoy the wonderful time capsule quality of the film; a lot has changed since 1957. The story is beautifully photographed (by Robert Burks) and wonderfully scored (by Bernard Herrmann, possibly his best), but the story is downright unbelievable, and deliberately so, I think, by a cynical artist who demonstrated (in an era of epics) that he could make a total incomprehensible film, and get away with it. The plot makes little sense and Hitchcock even pushes the envelope further by making the plot so unbelievable, that only a child would accept it. In 1983, the critics Seiskel & Ebert described The Trouble with Harry as ...Hitchcock's private joke...unfortunately, it's a little too private..., and I think the same can be said about Vertigo an uncompromising film that refuses to give little, if any instant gratification and insults our intelligence as well.I sometimes wonder if the whole movie is some huge practical joke on Hitchcock's part. In an era of epics, he decided to make the anti-epic. A personal private movie to prove that he had the wealth and the power, as an artist, to do anything he wanted to. A movie in which he would show total disdain for credibility or audience expectations, and sit back and watch (and laugh!) as all these pseudo-intellectuals, want-to-be movie critics, and various film buffs (maybe like us) tried to find meaning. (Surprise!... There isn't any!) Hitchcock liked to portray men as weak, ineffectual, mother and\/or wife dominated, or just plain thieves and killers. He outdid himself on this one with the two male leads1. John Scotty Ferguson-a dumb, inept, unmotivated, asexual, self-retired, middle-aged ex-detective. 2. Gavin Elster-A slimy, sleazy, smooth talking opportunist(and murderer as well!), masquerading as an industrialist.And then for a the women1. He has Marjorie Wood (how appropriate) a clueless nerdy, geeky, tomboy of a girl! (Hitchcock's cynicism is showing here...!) 2. Judy Bartlett (alias Madeleine Elster), a dumb blonde if there ever was one. A docile, stupid robot with one man, and a silly little girl with the other one....totally unbelievable!!Anyway...that's the way I see it at age 56, so maybe my cynicism is showing as well (and it's about the same age that Hitchcock was when he made this film). Must be nice to have the wealth & power to make a deliberate bomb, and still get paid for it! Artists are strange people, and Hitchcock sure was one of them!Steve G.Sept. 6, 2005 Update Alright, alright, maybe I was a little rough on Hitch; after all, it's only a movie! I am beginning to think that Hitch was living his fantasy while making this film. He was Scotty, and that's why the film is like a dream, with a lot of unexplained events. I'll settle for the nice scenery and music, but the plot...(well, let's just say it could have been better!).July 17, 2006 Update (posted in the message board as well)Hi Everybody, well...after all these years I finally saw the alternate (foreign censorship) ending, on the collector's edition DVD. A little hard to find you have to go to Bonus Materials, then Obsessed with Vertigo, then chapter list and scroll to chapter 14, and there it is! It only lasts a minute and 20 seconds, oh but what a difference it makes! Finally...some closure!! Takes place in Midge's apartment at night, and starts with a closeup of Midge to the left and a radio to the right. We hear the announcer saying that Gavin Elster was living in Switzerland but is now thought to be in France, and that Captain Hansen anticipates no trouble in having him extradited soon. Closeup of Midge as she hears footsteps and her front door opening. Scotty enters wearing a suit, but no hat, looks at Midge and then walks to the center of the room, and toward the window. Midge stands, and we now see she is only wearing a robe, and pours a drink for herself and Scotty. She walks over to him and hands him the drink then makes a half circle to her drawing desk, sits down, they both look at each other...fadeout! What happens after this is up to the viewer's imagination, but it was a great relief to me! I always thought that the original ending was kind of a cruel joke on the audience. Hitch was a weird guy! The foreign censors were correct in insisting on it (like spanking a naughty boy!). Where were our own censors, I'd like to know? How come the rest of the world got the complete story and the US didn't? Did Hitch forget we saved Britain from a German invasion? Weird guy...but thank God for closure!!! By the way, my new viewing does reveal a very well acted and very well crafted film, but still a rather prissy, childish, and silly story. That's my take anyway...!

Hitchcock is at his most extreme stilted and improbable story line, red herrings, unresolved scene endings, deliberately severed suspense, demeaning and downbeat character portrayals, and a totally cynical and uncompromising ending. Hitchcock of the least Hollywood kind, as one critic put it.Being from California, I do enjoy the wonderful time capsule quality of the film; a lot has changed since 1957. The story is beautifully photographed (by Robert Burks) and wonderfully scored (by Bernard Herrmann, possibly his best), but the story is downright unbelievable, and deliberately so, I think, by a cynical artist who demonstrated (in an era of epics) that he could make a total incomprehensible film, and get away with it. The plot makes little sense and Hitchcock even pushes the envelope further by making the plot so unbelievable, that only a child would accept it. In 1983, the critics Seiskel & Ebert described The Trouble with Harry as ...Hitchcock's private joke...unfortunately, it's a little too private..., and I think the same can be said about Vertigo an uncompromising film that refuses to give little, if any instant gratification and insults our intelligence as well.I sometimes wonder if the whole movie is some huge practical joke on Hitchcock's part. In an era of epics, he decided to make the anti-epic. A personal private movie to prove that he had the wealth and the power, as an artist, to do anything he wanted to. A movie in which he would show total disdain for credibility or audience expectations, and sit back and watch (and laugh!) as all these pseudo-intellectuals, want-to-be movie critics, and various film buffs (maybe like us) tried to find meaning. (Surprise!... There isn't any!) Hitchcock liked to portray men as weak, ineffectual, mother and\/or wife dominated, or just plain thieves and killers. He outdid himself on this one with the two male leads1. John Scotty Ferguson-a dumb, inept, unmotivated, asexual, self-retired, middle-aged ex-detective. 2. Gavin Elster-A slimy, sleazy, smooth talking opportunist(and murderer as well!), masquerading as an industrialist.And then for a the women1. He has Marjorie Wood (how appropriate) a clueless nerdy, geeky, tomboy of a girl! (Hitchcock's cynicism is showing here...!) 2. Judy Bartlett (alias Madeleine Elster), a dumb blonde if there ever was one. A docile, stupid robot with one man, and a silly little girl with the other one....totally unbelievable!!Anyway...that's the way I see it at age 56, so maybe my cynicism is showing as well (and it's about the same age that Hitchcock was when he made this film). Must be nice to have the wealth & power to make a deliberate bomb, and still get paid for it! Artists are strange people, and Hitchcock sure was one of them!Steve G.Sept. 6, 2005 Update Alright, alright, maybe I was a little rough on Hitch; after all, it's only a movie! I am beginning to think that Hitch was living his fantasy while making this film. He was Scotty, and that's why the film is like a dream, with a lot of unexplained events. I'll settle for the nice scenery and music, but the plot...(well, let's just say it could have been better!).July 17, 2006 Update (posted in the message board as well)Hi Everybody, well...after all these years I finally saw the alternate (foreign censorship) ending, on the collector's edition DVD. A little hard to find you have to go to Bonus Materials, then Obsessed with Vertigo, then chapter list and scroll to chapter 14, and there it is! It only lasts a minute and 20 seconds, oh but what a difference it makes! Finally...some closure!! Takes place in Midge's apartment at night, and starts with a closeup of Midge to the left and a radio to the right. We hear the announcer saying that Gavin Elster was living in Switzerland but is now thought to be in France, and that Captain Hansen anticipates no trouble in having him extradited soon. Closeup of Midge as she hears footsteps and her front door opening. Scotty enters wearing a suit, but no hat, looks at Midge and then walks to the center of the room, and toward the window. Midge stands, and we now see she is only wearing a robe, and pours a drink for herself and Scotty. She walks over to him and hands him the drink then makes a half circle to her drawing desk, sits down, they both look at each other...fadeout! What happens after this is up to the viewer's imagination, but it was a great relief to me! I always thought that the original ending was kind of a cruel joke on the audience. Hitch was a weird guy! The foreign censors were correct in insisting on it (like spanking a naughty boy!). Where were our own censors, I'd like to know? How come the rest of the world got the complete story and the US didn't? Did Hitch forget we saved Britain from a German invasion? Weird guy...but thank God for closure!!!
