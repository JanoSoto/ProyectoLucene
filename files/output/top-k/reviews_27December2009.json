Wanting to know the future & how he can change it for the better Caesar learns that the human archives contains tapes that feature Zira & Cornelius talking about the future. Caesar, human MacDonald (Austin Stoker) & wise Ape Professor Virgil (Paul Williams) travel to the archives in the ruined city & find the tapes but also alert a race of underground humans contaminated by radioactivity of their existence, in a decision of kill or be killed the human tribe decide to wage war on the Apes & wipe them all out...Directed by J. Lee Thompson this was the fourth & final sequel to the original Planet of the Apes (1968), recently released on DVD & Blu-ray in a ten minutes longer than the original theatrical version 'Director's Cut' it's this longer 96 minute version that I will be basing my comments on. The film & it's continuity isn't that great but it's sort of fun in a silly sci-fi action sort of way, although within the space of ten years since Conquest of the Planet of the Apes there's been a nuclear war that has wiped out humanity & the Apes have learned to speak plus the ending in which Ape & human seem to co-exist in harmony is definitely at odds with the future that is clearly set out in the original two Planet of the Ape films & maybe it's no great surprise in retrospect that Battle for the Planet of the Apes turned out to be the last one. Although Battle for the Planet of the Apes does alter some continuity it retains some as it sets up the whole mutant human race & the atomic bomb plot from Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970) & it refers to previous character's such as Zira & Cornelius. The film moves along at a decent pace, there's some alright if workmanlike action scenes & it's watchable but the dialogue which seems to try & have character's say something profound every time they open their mouth's is badly written. The whole role reversal is here again too as the makers try to point out humanities flaws with the story like the dangers of war & not to put animals in cages & stuff like that.The make-up effects look cheap here as the executives at Twentieth Century Fox kept cutting the budget of each subsequent Planet of the Ape film, the original Planet of the Apes had a budget of nearly six million while by the time Battle for the Planet of the Apes was made it had a budget of less than two million. The battle scenes are rather flat & sure there's a few explosions & some gunfire but nothing terribly exciting or particularly well shot.With a supposed budget of about $1,800,000 this looks alright but nothing amazing. Roddy McDowall again stars but this time as Caesar who is the son of Cornelius who he played in the previous films. Oscar winner John Huston has a cameo while future director John Landis has a small role early on in his career.Battle for the Planet of the Apes isn't a total disaster & if you like the franchise then this is worth seeking out, even if your not it does have a few good moments & it entertains although the heavy handed morals can get tiresome as in the rest of the series.

Having re-watched it today I have felt the need to knock another point off.I really enjoyed this film. I love the premise of having an entire film shot predominantly in a single location in real time. In a lot of ways it is more of a play than a film and this gives it a unique twist (although I am aware of plenty of other films that adopt the same technique).The positives points of the film are Character development - We get to know the characters at the same time and to the same depth as those in the room, no more, no less. We are given limited knowledge about them, their backgrounds, their prejudices and are encouraged to judge them in similar vain to how they are judging the defendant on the limited information they have about him. Very clever and the mix of personalities from the shy, retiring to the clearly angry and racist rings true of the likely cross section of personalities that would be found in a real jury room.The message of the story - I think it rings true today just as much as it did in the 1950's. Trial by jury is a flawed concept and people can be easily manipulated by fellow jurors and lawyers alike. I particularly like how juror 12 flits between guilty and not guilty and how they are all too eager to make a snap judgement without thinking in the first instance. This is a common problem - these people are not lawyers, they do not think like lawyers and will always struggle to set aside their personal feelings and prejudices to look at the facts in the cold, hard light of day taking account of the reasonable doubt issue. The manner in which this film uses its limited set\/time frame to achieve the very real feeling of manipulation is impressive to say the least.The acting - All of the actors play their parts perfectly. You find yourself wanting to know more about them but realise the premise is that you are in the same shoes as the others. To be given such thinly created (in the best sense possible) characters and still want to know more about them (where did the racist undertones come from, what happened between juror 3 and his son, why is juror 8 so eager to prove the reasonable doubt?) is impressive, especially in such an ensemble piece.So where does it lose points? Simply put I don't like the way that the innocence is proved. It flys in the face of the proper court process and is just a little unbelievable and all too conveniently pieced together (do you really think they would be paying such close attention to a witnesses nose??). I understand the need to create the reasonable doubt but feel that it was done too easily with each juror falling into place far too quickly. I was also disappointed that juror 3 gave up his convictions. It would have been a much greater triumph, in my eyes, if it had been a hung jury. I agreed with juror 3 and empathised with the choice he had to make and felt that the honorable juror 8 bullied his opinions on everyone else.The point of the jury is to consider the evidence put before them and to make a judgement on that basis. They should not bring in numerous assumptions (and that is what they did) which colour the evidence they have been given. Doing so will always create sufficient doubt to acquit the defendant. There is too much danger in doing so and I do not believe that in a room of 12 strong characters no one would raise such an objection.Or I may be missing the point entirely! Maybe the manipulation by juror 8 is the whole point....In conclusion, therefore, I can see why it is a classic but am at slight pains to understand its high position in the top 250 given the nature of the perceived flaws. Having said this I suggest that if you enjoy thought provoking, well scripted and acted drama this film is a must see.

Chris has two commanding officers, the ill-tempered and indestructible Staff Sergeant Robert Barnes and the more pleasant and cooperative Sergeant Elias Grodin. A line is drawn between the two officers and a number of men in the platoon when an illegal killing occurs during a village raid. As the war continues, Chris himself draws towards psychological meltdown... Oliver Stone's Platoon is an epic film that depicts the Vietnam War and the horrific things that some men did and witnessed, it also shows the insanity of war, the terrible conditions the soldiers fought under, and perhaps more importantly, the psychological element that wore down so many men. Stone used some of his own experiences of being in Vietnam to write this story and the result is what seems to be a very authentic and realistic film. It's a gritty and emotional look at this terrible conflict, mostly seen through the perspective of the young recruit Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen). The main storyline and possible the most interesting aspect of the film is the realization by Taylor, that he is fighting two battles, the conflict with the enemy and the conflict between the men within his platoon. In terms of the story I thought it was terrific and it feels\/looks authentic, however, with the exception of Sheen, the acting was a bit over the top and quite a distraction. The musical score is very effective with the Adagio for Strings composition really bringing all the emotion out of the scenes. In conclusion, Platoon is a great war film, it might be disturbing but it's also necessary.

The plan being to release the film as two three hour parts. Apparently the producers refused to do this and insisted that the film be cut more and this is where the 229 minute version was arrived at. It also seems that the director wanted the eventual cut to be at least 265 minutes to include 'essential' footage but this 'extra' had to be left on the cutting room floor. The reason I have put this narrative at the beginning of this review is to demonstrate that if anybody has any problem with the continuity or events not being linked clearly then it is for these reasons and not a lack of care and attention from those ultimately responsible in the making of this film. I choose to believe the above mainly because of the very nature of the film. It is an epic and therefore in my opinion be judged on the overall feel of the film when the person watching it has watched it all. I would not recommend anyone watch the even shorter version which is only 139 minutes. I have never seen it but I am told it is a shambles and should be avoided. The 229 minutes version is apparently the only one we the viewing public have access to (excluding the shambles) so please bear in mind the above when you do watch this film.Having said all the above this film is well worth the time spent watching it and providing you watch it all and preferably in one sitting I think you will get a better idea of what the story is all about. The film still has everything most people would want from such a masterpiece. Considering the number of people that could have actually starred in this film its a wonder it was ever completed but the people who were in it contributed greatly to the end result. Not having been to America I can only assume that what one sees is a reasonable recreation of the times as they are portrayed and therefore the film should be enjoyed on the basis that it is telling a story that just happens to take longer to tell than most films.

The plan being to release the film as two three hour parts. Apparently the producers refused to do this and insisted that the film be cut more and this is where the 229 minute version was arrived at. It also seems that the director wanted the eventual cut to be at least 265 minutes to include 'essential' footage but this 'extra' had to be left on the cutting room floor. The reason I have put this narrative at the beginning of this review is to demonstrate that if anybody has any problem with the continuity or events not being linked clearly then it is for these reasons and not a lack of care and attention from those ultimately responsible in the making of this film. I choose to believe the above mainly because of the very nature of the film. It is an epic and therefore in my opinion be judged on the overall feel of the film when the person watching it has watched it all. I would not recommend anyone watch the even shorter version which is only 139 minutes. I have never seen it but I am told it is a shambles and should be avoided. The 229 minutes version is apparently the only one we the viewing public have access to (excluding the shambles) so please bear in mind the above when you do watch this film.Having said all the above this film is well worth the time spent watching it and providing you watch it all and preferably in one sitting I think you will get a better idea of what the story is all about. The film still has everything most people would want from such a masterpiece.

Show a special effect (many similar to, but not as interesting as the sequences in 2001, A Space Odyssey filmed a dozen years earlier). Follow special effect with reaction shot. Then another reaction shot. Then another special effect. Then another reaction shot. The amount of interesting dialog could fit on the back of a cereal box, in large print. Spends so much time showing the exterior of the Enterprise it seemed like porn for nerds. Slow pacing. I was thinking it would be a good exercise for a film class on editing to see if you could get a good 45 minutes out of this. But I'm not sure it would be a fair assignment. Look, I like Star Trek. I watched it in the '60s, watched it in syndication in the '70s, have seen most (perhaps all) of the movies. Have seen many episodes of each of the ST franchise. This movie stunk. Most significant fact about this movie -- William Shatner appeared to be in better shape than when he was in the series, or in later films. Of course he may have been wearing a trussI looked up Robert Wise's other credits, and he did know how to tell a story at one time. But I can't imagine he was proud of directing this one.

If you've seen a Jim Carrey movie you know his style, he tends to overdo a little sometimes but he manages to stay funny, a lot of people don't like him because of all the weird stuff he throws in while acting, but this movie can change some minds about Carrey. The Mask follows the story of Stanley Ipkins, an average guy who finds an ancient Scandinavian mask, it contains within the Norse god Loki banished and imprisoned, now whoever puts on the mask gets possesses by the joker spirit of the god gaining incredible powers and the will to cause problems.In The Mask Carrey plays two characters, one is the more-than-regular Stanley Ipkins, who's a shy fan of cartoons and works at a bank, he's not good with the ladies and the world seems to conspire against him at all costs, luck sure doesn't seem to enjoy playing on the side of Ipkins at all. The other is when he puts on the mask and transforms himself into a green-masked party-boy maniac, ready to joke all around town, all his romantic repression is unleashed and he starts acting in a cartoony style much like the cartoons he enjoys so much seeing. There are funny scenes all around but the highlights are when Carrey puts on the mask, including dance scenes; one is particularly funny because it has a cover music track of Cuban Pete sang by Carrey himself, seems like the song was destined to be funny. The movie also features the debut of Cameron Diaz when she actually looked cute and not a super-sized barbie doll.If you like Carrey you really should see this movie because it's one of the best stuff Carrey ever pulled. If you're not a fan, you can still enjoy it because he also plays a normal character that's actually normal, without the weird faces, with the crazy stuff being performed by his masked person, although the crazyness is probably boosted, it's easily understandable since he's indeed possessed.

Heck, it was superb for an actress of any age.The story is of a girl named Amy who was separated from her father as a young child when her parents divorced and her mother took her to New Zealand. When her mother is killed in an auto accident her father returns her to his home in Canada where she becomes withdrawn until she rescues a clutch of Canadian Goose eggs that had been abandoned by the mother. She cares for the eggs until they hatch and the goslings imprint her as their mother.The goslings grow to maturity through the summer, and when the time for them to migrate south is approaching it becomes necessary for them to be lead on their trip by Amy and her father who fly two ultra light planes to guide them on their way south.This may be a spoiler As they fly south and are nearing their goal, a wetlands area in one of the Carolinas, the father's ultra light crashes. He is only slightly injured but his plane is destroyed and Amy must carry on alone for the last few miles. The ending is very touching and emotional when she reaches the end of the journey, but even though it brings tears to my eyes each time I watch it, it could have been made more dramatic if the fact that she was now alone in the sky, somewhat anxious and out of touch, had been emphasized by the TV announcers so that the final scene when her plane, and the geese, appeared suddenly over the dunes would be even more dramatic.I highly recommend this movie for both children and adults. The co-star, Jeff Daniels, and supporting actress Dana Delaney, are superb in their roles. Dana Delaney is always magnificent and even in this somewhat minor role she lights up the screen.

It starts intriguing with a man called Jason Bourne found shot on a fishing boat way out to see who wakes knowing nothing about himself, his name or past life and ends up being pursued by assassins as he tries to find out about himself.Overall the story of the film is quite complicated to understand and may need re seeing twice but even then you like me may lose your interest in anything that's going on. Another criticism is that there is too much plot with very little action attached throughout.

It shows perfectly what all humans could look like if everybody suffered from the same condition(s) as Joseph Merrick and there will always be somebody who earns a living out of someone as unfortunate as Joseph and in 2009 it is no different. I have seen a number of documentaries shown recently on British TV where unfortunate people who happen to have an abnormality are paraded and poked and photographed purely because of the way they look. Granted most of these programmes and reasonably well made but all of them showed that if there is money to be made somebody will exploit the unfortunates, it is still the way of the world. What this film attempts to do is to show to the viewer that inside each unfortunate is a human being who has feelings and emotions like everybody else. I do not know if this condition is treatable now but one would hope that medical science could do something to alleviate the distress. It appears these tumours which Joseph had on his body were not malignant but they continued to grow and affect everything he did in his daily life. The film is a sobering look at an intelligent person who is ridiculed and taken advantage of merely because he doesn't physically conform to the norm. It is a testament to everybody who was involved in the films creation that the end result is not a travesty or a white wash but a study mainly of everybody else who came into contact with him and how they reacted to him. He was just a man who happened to look different to everybody else. The numerous people who laughed and stared at him maybe had something inside which was abnormal and that was and is sad. Having said all of this it is only my opinion and thankfully everybody will have different views. I would recommend anyone watch this film and would hope that everybody should watch it at least once.

Even if it had not been made under such difficult circumstances, it will still stand as a magnificent masterpiece. With a script by the poet Jacques Prevert and direction by Marcel Carne, it stars Arletty and Jean-Louis Barrault as its main characters, Garance and Baptiste Dubureau.The story takes place on the Boulevard de Crime in 1840s France, a street teeming with people and theater of all kinds. A mime, Baptiste (Barrault) becomes obsessed with a street woman, Garance (Arletty), a mysterious creature who becomes the artistic muse of two men, Baptiste and Frederick LeMaitre (Pierre Brasseur). Shyness keeps Baptiste from becoming Garance's lover, and he loses her to LeMaitre and others. Meanwhile, Nathalie (Casares) loves Baptiste and isn't afraid to say so. Garance finally realizes that she is as much in love with Baptiste as he is with her, but now they are both ensconced in other lives. What will they do? Les enfants du paradis is a dark film, going from intimate two-person scenes to massive crowd scenes on the boulevard, taking us into the dark alleys of Paris and the after-hours crowd in bars to the theater rabble-rousers, and demonstrating the power of mime in performance. This is a world of hungry actors, crooks, hustlers, casual sex, and great art.Only in France would a woman in her mid-forties be cast as a femme fatale - imagine Hollywood doing that in 1945. The Garbo-ish Arletty manages to be earthy and mysterious as Garance. The actress was not invited to the premiere of this film due to her fall from grace - she had a German officer as a lover during the war. In fact, she was arrested and spent time in a concentration camp, finally being put under house arrest. She did return triumphantly to film and worked until 1967, when blindness from an accident forced her to retire. She died in 1992 at the age of 94.The thin, sensitive looking Jean-Louis Barrault gives an exquisite performance as Baptiste, a role based on the real-life mime Jean-Gaspard Deburau, who invented the character of Pierrot. So successful was Barrault's pantomime work that it revived interest in the art form in France and made it possible for Marcel Marceau to become hugely popular. Barrault's performance is still studied in mime schools today. A passionate man, Barrault actually hid members of the resistance on the set of Les enfants du paradis.

If I had a proverbial gun to my head, I'd have to say that Holiday Inn holds up better in terms of story and continuity, even though both pictures have elements that defy credibility and have you going 'huh?' even while providing a boat load of entertainment.It's a quick newspaper column story that caught my eye that probably sums up the Holiday Inn concept best - Bing's notion of refurbishing a Connecticut homestead into an entertainment venue for fifteen holidays per year is deemed a 'freak idea'. I doubt if the Bingster could make that idea work in real life, even if he and Fred Astaire headlined each show like they did here.But in between the less believable moments, you do have some top shelf entertainment, among them Crosby's singing numbers, and some downright awesome footwork from Astaire. His Fourth of July tap-dance garners well deserved accolades, and I can't imagine a better drunken dance interpretation than the one he did with Marjorie Reynolds in his first appearance at the Inn. Bing and Reynolds in black-face - too garishly over the top by today's politically correct standards, but still important in depicting an earlier era dealing with themes of race and equality. Fortunately, the character of Mamie (Louise Beavers) and her two children was handled with respect and sincerity.So depending on your disposition, Holiday Inn remains a respected movie in the tradition of your great Christmas classics, or just another picture to while away the time while waiting for Santa to arrive.

The more you scratch beneath the surface, the richer it gets.********* The Wild Bunch (6\/18\/69) Sam Peckinpah ~ William Holden, Ernest Borgnine, Robert Ryan, Jaime Sanchez ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Western"},{"date":"27 December 2009","score":"4 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" At first glance, Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch seems like a very ordinary story. The more realistic tone, and violent content, which heralded its arrival, are no longer new - it wasn't completely new in 1969, either - but, this was an obviously stylistic, staged vision, by a director who rode westerns into their saturation level of success, on television. During the previous decade, the western racked up more TV prime-time hours than any other genre; and, Mr. Peckinpah was a major contributor. He obviously had some horse sense. Alas, the preeminent western died a slow death, and never fully recovered. This film is almost a tombstone.Peckinpah, photographer Lucien Ballard, and musician Jerry Fielding are at their best. How great thou art.

Moreover, I'm seriously relieved that neither myself nor any of my closest relatives is due to check into the hospital for any type of 'routine procedure' any time soon, as one single viewing of this film is enough to make you paranoid and suspicious about everything that might be going on there. Susan Wheeler is a young and promising resident surgeon at the acclaimed Boston Memorial Hospital who, following her own friend's simple abortion gone wrong, begins to investigate the unusually large number of spontaneous comatose cases. Apparently, and during the past year alone already, more than ten totally healthy and young patients fell into a coma after seemingly routine surgical procedures. Dr. Wheeler suspects a conspiracy, especially when it turns out all patients were treated in the same OR and transported to the mysterious Jefferson Institute afterwards, but the entire medical staff &#x96; including her ambitious fellow surgeon and lover Mark Bellows &#x96; revokes her attempts to prove it. I was seriously surprised to eventually find out how rudimentary the denouement of Coma in fact is. The mysterious occurrences and Dr. Wheeler's private investigation lead towards a fairly logical and even somewhat predictable conclusion, but still it I must admit it left me disturbed and speechless. This is entirely Michael Crichton's earning, as the screenplay is very careful and thrifty with the revelation of elementary story elements and twists. Coma basically could have been a rather short and straightforward thriller, but Crichton expands it into a compelling and sometimes even somewhat overlong mystery thriller. I've read in the trivia section of this website that both the author of the original novel, Robin Cook, and writer\/director Michael Crichton hold a doctor's degree. This is clearly noticeable in the dialogs and automatically turns Coma into a far more plausible and respectable medical thriller. Believe you me, I've seen numerous hospital slashers of which the dialogs didn't contain any medical terminology at all and that is quite pathetic to observe. Coma works terrifically as a tense and nail-biting thriller, but admittedly it isn't the most exciting movie ever made. The development of Dr. Wheeler's research keeps you on the edge of the seat, but the actual action and suspense sequences are tedious and overdone. The assassination of maintenance witnesses, for example, is completely gratuitous and even Susan's hysterical escape from the Jefferson institute feels dragged in just to appeal to fans of the more exploitative 70's thrillers. The cast is stupendous, with glorious roles for Genevieve Bujold and Michael Douglas and delightfully suspicious roles for Rip Torn and Richard Widmark.
