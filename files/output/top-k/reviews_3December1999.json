It lacks the strong characters and more subtle terror of the former and calls for a good deal of suspension of disbelief to set the scene for the action.  Jaws was believable and possible, if somewhat implausible.  This movie is neither believable nor plausible, and is mostly impossible.The trailers gave away the story, what remains are the details. Bio-engineered sharks, increased in size several times so as to increase their brain size in search of a cure for Alzheimer's disease, go on the rampage in an effort to be free of their confines and return to the open sea.  The movie stars them in their attempts to do so while watching the crew dwindle in numbers.  The lackluster acting by the human actors ensures that the sharks are the stars of this movie.  Even Samuel Jackson was not notable and his character was all too predictable, (including what happened to him).The realistic models of the sharks and the computer graphics are far more realistic than Bruce, the great white shark in that other, better, shark movie, and are a bit more realistic in that respect, but don't be scared to go in the water.  The size of these sharks is well beyond realistic proportions and the traits they exhibit are a result of their genetic enhancement.  This movie is pure fiction and bears no resemblance to real sharks.It also breaks a few laws of physics, which are often overlooked  when they get in the way of the story.  Most scuba divers and others will recognize the fallacies of some scenes and their lack of decompression problems.Why would you want to see this movie?  For the sharks and seeing them rip the humans apart (done mostly at a distance and very fast so there is much less gore than you might suspect).  There is nothing else to recommend this movie.I saw it at a theater that only charges $2 and thought it a fair value.  I wouldn't pay much more than that, though.  You probably wouldn't want to either. ","genre":null},{"date":"3 December 1999","score":"","review":"  No one should confuse this film with either Jaws or any basis of reality.

A very good first act, a very good introduction.But EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, in my opinion, is the best in the trilogy. Why? Let me break it down1) Yoda. What more can I say? An ancient alien midget. A wisecracking Jedi Master. Where Han Solo gives us the irony of the series, Yoda gives us the muppet-ized hilarity of it. 2) Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian.

It's so funny when you look at STAR WARS A NEW HOPE, and you think that she loves Luke. Han and Leia are so cute here. Bickering, fighting, kissing, and in the end, admitting of their true feelings. And Han always knew. What a lovely intergalactic romance.4) We first learn of Darth Vader's true identity and his relation to Skywalker.5) Awesome light sabre showdown between Vader and Luke that served up what we couldn't get from Vader and Obi-Wan's confrontation in HOPE.

The icy snow in the beginning. The misty, marshy swamp of Yoda's home. The heavenly blissful City in the Clouds. Even the Death Star looks better than the last one! Not to mention Darth's suit looks MUCH better, as do R2D2 and C3P0, most likely to do with the gross earned from the first one.9) There are so many cool creatures and machines here.

I had seen BWP a few weeks before and thought it was creepy, but overhyped, and not the scariest movie of all time like everyone said. I had friends who said they almost cried BWP scared them so bad. Well, there's one of many moments in this (there's so many that just made every hair on my body stand on end, my skin crawl, and made me actually gasp- and I can say that movies that only have 1 or 2 moments like that, I can probably only name 10 or so) I won't give the end away, but the moment that starts out with the  kid appearing to Cole and whispering excitedly, Come on, I'll show you where my Dad keeps his gun- that one moment, to me, was 10 times scarier than all of BWP put together. There were many times where I jumped, and it wasn't just a fake jump, it was something clever that I genuinely didn't see coming. As far as The Twist, first of all, I've decided when it's hyped that a movie HAS a twist ending, that's a drag right there, because you-well, I do anyway--spend at least half the time trying to guess the twist. Having seen a hell of a lot of movies, and a hell of a lot of twists, I usually get it 9 times out of 10. (BEGIN MINOR SPOILER) I guessed the twist in Jacob's Ladder, so...and it was already spoiled because I read a review that DIDNT give a warning, but said, If you've seen Jacob's Ladder and Angelheart, you'll see this one coming a mile away(END) I'm pretty much the spoiler queen, it's like heroin or something, maybe 1% of the time I can resist reading them, I don't know what it is. If I had to pick any movie where I could go back and not know the spoiler ahead of time, this would be it. My husband didn't see it coming, and he's pretty clever about guessing them too.

Better acting, better effects, better storyline. It picks up directly where the original leaves off. This time, Marty, Doc Brown and Marty's girlfriend, Jennifer, travel to the year 2015 in order to prevent certain disasters with Marty's kids. While in the future, Marty buys a sports almanac (50 years of sports statistics 1950-2000) which he wants to take back to 1985 with the hopes of winning a lot of money. Unfortunately, old Biff Tannen manages to grab the book after Doc Brown throws it away, and steals the Delorean to take it to the future (or the past?) Marty, Doc and Jennifer arrive in 1985 again only to find it has been tampered with, and their little town of Hill Valley has become a bigtime war zone. Seems Biff was the cause of it, as he won a huge amount of money in his early years which caused him to become a millionaire tycoon. Marty investigates and him and Doc need to go back to 1955 in order to repair the damage done to 1985! (I hope you get it so far) In 1955, Marty tracks down young Biff this time in order to get the almanac and destroy it so the normal timeline can be restored. He also has to be careful not to run into his other self, because he is in 1955 on the same day that he goes back to the future in the original movie. Well, this movie certainly is clever, no doubt about that, but it isn't at all lighthearted as the original, it is a dark movie, especially when the action shifts to the alternate 1985. For a movie that in reality, takes place 4 years after the first movie, it pulls off the continuity nicely. The acting is great, especially by Christopher Lloyd and Michael J. Fox. Elizabeth Shue replaces Claudia Wells as Jennifer and Crispin Glover is only in scenes from the original movie.

Nostalgia is one thing, but can we move on TOWARDS the future as the millennium closes?I think Doug Liman's kicky, clever nightlife movie SWINGERS is somewhat guilty of pulling underground swing music into the mainstream (it launched Big Bad Voodoo Daddy into a brief success on MTV and music catalogs), but who cares. Jon Favreau gives us a story that's funny and so true of men, no matter what their taste of hip is.Jon Favreau plays Mike, a comedian from New York who now resides in sunny L.A. and slumps into the depressing stages of being dumped by his long-time girlfriend. It's funny watching other people's reactions to him. Either you think he's a chump or a really sweet guy. He is, honestly, the latter, because you are either the kind of guy who wants true love in a relationship or a long list of digits from girls you met at a club just so you never have a boring night without sex.The foil is Mike's best bud Trent (showstealer Vince Vaughn) who desperately tries to get Mikey back in the game. Trent drags Mike to Las Vegas in one of the movie's best scenes.The main point of this film is to show the nightlife rituals of young single men. To show their real feelings under a slew of masks they wear just to attract some pretty babies. Oh, and Jon Favreau's script is chopfull of hip lingo from Swingers sub-culture money, babies, etc. Most of it sounds like oldskool hip-hop slang (i.e. the Nike commercials with Spike Lee and Michael Jordan), but whatever.

The only thing that drives me crazy about this movie is the cover box. Whoever thought up that misguided box should be fired, and I believe it is the reason nobody has seen this movie. We are led to believe this is a straight comedy with no meaning or plot. Just a screwed-over assistant on the war path. It is such a misrepresentation, it makes me laugh.Having said that, let me say that this is a hilarious movie. But so what, so was Pulp Fiction, neither belong in the comedy section of your video store, though. Kevin Spacey is a genius, and this is yet another stand-out role in what is becoming one of the greatest string of performances any actor has ever accomplished. He is so over the top here, you can't help but laugh. I don't want to give away too much, but the scene where he is walking to the elevator from his car, wondering why it is such a problem for Guy (Frank Whaley) to get ahold of one of the executives of the company who is white-water rafting in a place with no phones so, they have helicopters, don't they? is just hilarious. Especially when he gets into the elevator, and a feeble assistant tries to make it in before the doors close OUT, OUT, WHO DO YOU WORK FOR?!?!?! It is too funny, and scenes like that just keep coming.But to call this movie a comedy does not do it enough justice. It works on many different levels, exploring how far we can be pushed before we are sent over the edge, how far someone with power can take it before he goes too far, etc. While not usually much of a sentimentalist, I thought the scene where Spacey breaks down while discussing the murder of his wife was touching and insightful. I liked that it showed that even the most heartless b*****d has his own story to tell, and it makes for a more two-dimensional character. Basically, this movie is great in every way, and I can't say enough about Frank Whaley's performance. He is sort of overshadowed by Spacey's character, but that's the point. He plays the cowering lap-dog perfectly, and to see how the abuse pushes him into a completely different character is fascinating. If you're on this site, you've probably seen the movie, so please, go recommend this to everyone. If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor. 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"3 December 1999","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  It's a shame that so few people have seen or even heard of this movie, because it is one of the best of its kind.
