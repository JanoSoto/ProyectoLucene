Everybody was saying the story was so beautiful and how it touched them and that it will surely win an Oscar for best picture, but I was disappointed to even see it nominated in that category. And it definitely stole  it for best score. But enough about that. The one and only thing the movie's got going for it are the amazing fighting scenes wich are done really well and precise. But that's it. The rest of the movie (except, well, Zhang Ziyi) is really boring and complete garbage. The movie really put me down and I can't remember when I last fell that depressed. Afterwards I just went home and went to bed at 10 o' clock on a Friday night. I have to blame everything on the people that put together the trailer of the movie - they presented it as a sort of kung fu movie, making sure that they only showed the action sequences and the effects (about 15% of the movie) and none of the boring stuff (you do the math). And that has never happened to me before, I always knew al least what kind of a movie I was going to see, so imagine my surprise there I am, watching the movie, expecting to see lots of action and the characters just keep babbling about a magical sword and talking about read-it-between-the-lines love. Blah. And I knew this movie would be bogus the moment I found out who was directing it - mister sensibility himself, I just convinced myself I'd give it a chance. After this crap I began appreciating my instincts a whole lot more.But it couldn't have been that bad a movie says the layman; let me put it this way, I consider myself an eye-candy man, meaning that I have seen all kinds of crappy movies, but hey, if they had decent effects, if they were presented in an interesting way, mercy, if they even had a decent musical accompaniment, they had something to offer, they were at least viewable. Well, this movie has special effects that should be seen with a bib only, but the story, it really hurts just to remember myself about it, well for the story you need a vomit bag, the kind they have aboard airplanes, SO I DEFINITELY NEVER, EVER WANT TO SEE THIS MOVIE EVER AGAIN (except the Zhang Ziyi part). A waste of time, but a good movie if you're the masochist type.

I say highly surreal at times, down right weird and do you know what? it was captivating, I left the cinema screen and since that time the film has stayed in my head. It has a David Lynch and Cronenberg quality about it, in that you never really know what is supposed to be real and what isn't at certain points in the film. All the performances are great, particularly the three leads, Cruise, Cruz and Diaz and for me like many critics the sexy, gorgeous, Cameron Diaz narrowly steals the show.

It is really strange, but it is wonderfully shot and excellently acted. Occasionally this film seems like a music video and at other times an advert for a phone company or something, and most of the film I was left with a look of bemusement but in a good way like with films such as Fight Club or Videodrome, just two that come to mind. Where this differs from some others of this sort of confusion based film is that it gives you an answer as to what is going on at the end which you won't see coming until quite close when they hint at it, but then you still are left doubting whats happening thanks to the rest of the movie. I really like this film despite the fact it annoyed the hell out of me, but it did so with good intention unlike some movies that annoy purely because they are bad. I recommend this definately, it stretches the rules of movie making to its limits and leaves you in a daze, some may dislkie this sort of film but I like many love the effect a film like this gives you. I think the director Cameron Crowe achieved what he set out to do, leave the movie in your thoughts long after you've left the screen.

They get along great and start seeing each-other, but when Hal's just as shallow friend, Mauricio then un-hypnotises Hal, the big test will be to see if once Hal finally sees what Rosemary really looks like, will he still want to be with her.Shallow Hal stars, Jack Black, Jason Alexander, Gwyneth Paltrow and Sascha Knopf. They are all great actors\/actress' and they give good and believable performances in the movie, which is one of the main things that makes the movie what it is.Yes, the Farrelly brothers have a really strange and sick humour, so when you go see one of there movies you expect that, but most recently each time they bring out new movies, they get weirder and cruder each time. I'm not really sure if I really want to see any more of there 'new' movies. Shallow Hal is not exactly a brilliant movie, but definitely better than some of the Farrelly brothers other work. One of the reasons, being the cast in the movie who are brilliant in there roles and even though the story-line to Shallow Hal is not exactly fantastic, I guess, it's different and provides a few laughs at times. Some people may find this movie  funny, others may find it offensive. It's bound to have different opinions from everyone who watches it. Oh, well, I'm not sure what else to say about it, but it was okay, anyway.

While it was largely fiction, it was entertaining, had some memorable villains and lots of great actors (er, Special Guest Stars), like William Bendix, Nehemiah Persoff and Claire Trevor, just to name a few. I'd heard somewhere that the '87 DePalma movie was supposed to be more realistic and closer to fact. Well, I heard wrong. There might be a spoiler or two in here, just in case you haven't seen it.My first criticism is a technical one. Near the beginning there are a lot of close-ups on Eliot Ness and his wife as they move about their house. I found this to go on for too long and it made me feel claustrophobic. The opening scene with Robert DeNiro as Al Capone was a complete rip-off from an earlier scene in the great Key Largo. Like Johnny Rocco (played by my favorite actor, Edward G. Robinson), Capone is getting a shave. It was okay, I guess. Maybe if I'd have know what was coming later I'd have disliked it more.Speaking of rip-offs, there's a later scene that features a shoot out on a staircase, complete with a woman pushing a baby carriage. This is STRAIGHT out of Film History 101 the Odessa Steps scene in Potemkin, by Sergei Eisenstein. Okay, it was well done, and it could be excused. I'm not sure that many casual moviegoers would be aware of it or even care.But then there's the Canadian Border scene, in which our heroes raid a convoy of bootleggers on horseback. So good so far. Soon the inevitable gunfight erupts. The air is thick with bullets. Maybe these horses were possessed of magical powers. They either dodge the bullet saturated air or the bullets pass right through them. I guess that's why they use blanks. I tried to sink down low in the chair in case anyone I knew might see me. This was where I realized I'd been suckered into yet another summer film for kids out of school.There's a final point. At the end of the movie (big spoiler here), Ness gets into a fight with the evil Frank Nitti. He puts up a mighty struggle, but finally Ness gets the upper hand and tosses Nitti off the roof, presumably to his death. Okay, maybe it's not that big a spoiler since we all know Ness is going to win in the end.There's a slight problem with this scene. Nitti, the real Frank Nitti, was NEVER thrown off a roof. In real life he committed suicide after he was convicted and sentenced to prison. So much for the movie being more true to fact.I was also disappointed to see Sean Connery get an Academy Award for this. He's done many better films, but I guess the Academy members felt he was due an award and this was the only film he was in that year. He was probably the best thing in this movie, but the rest of it was so predictable that it was too much for his performance to overcome.If you want to see a much better movie, try to find the original Untouchables pilot, Scarface Mob. It has another of my all time favorite actors, Neville Brand, as Scarface Al Capone, Bruce Gordon as Frank The Enforcer Nitti and Robert Stack as Eliot Ness. Their performances are excellent. Here's a bit of trivia The Chicago Outfit actually put a contract on Desi Arnaz, whose Desilu Studios produced the original Untouchables, because they didn't like how Frank Nitti was portrayed. I doubt the later version managed to evoke such a response, except perhaps by dissatisfied viewers....

Now, what CD has that extended version of Slow Ride?I was one of the few who actually saw DAZED AND CONFUSED when it was in theatres (thank you, AMC Deptford 8 in New Jersey).  At first I didn't think much of it; the great reviews I had read about it caused me to be a bit underwhelmed.  But since I'm in full disclosure mode right about now, I'll admit that my third viewing of this movie coincided with the first time I really got stoned.  Its clarity and beauty was finally revealed, and this is a big reason why this film is so dear to me.DAZED AND CONFUSED is obviously in my all-time Top 10.  If you're looking for an expert, you've found one.  I've been following the careers of every actor in this classic - and not just the stars like Ben, Matthew and Parker.  I'm talking Adam, Anthony, Rory, Sasha, Cole, Marissa, Nicky, and, of course, Wiley (great to finally see him again in WAKING LIFE).

It has very little, it seems, to say about the political or military experience, in that war.  However, it has enormous things to say about humanity, madness, death, nature, technology, and civilization.  I suppose any book or movie will mean different things to different people, and seeing something may not have been what the writer intended--but I don't think that detracts or means its false, sometimes writers or artists don't fully appreciate their own work (always makes me think about the scene in Back to School where Kurt Vonnegut ghost writes an analysis of his book Slaughterhouse Five for Rodney Dangerfield, only to have the professor declare it to be the worst paper she'd ever seen.As for Apocalypse Now, the basic story or central purpose seems, to me, to show how thin the veneer of civilization really is--that our darker savage selves are only to ready to come struggling to the surface.  As Martin Sheen goes up the river, he loses sight of civilization, as if jungle were sucking it up, overcoming all of it. I've seen it also described as a journey back in time, which in some sense is the same idea--to that end, the last twenty minutes or so with Brando shaded in darkness is genius.As he sits there pondering the true nature of man--and how in warfare, horror becomes a friend--you can see the culmination of Willard's trip; the high tech helicopters and munitions have been stripped away (seeing the downed helicopter just before reaching Kurtz was an interesting example).  When Chef says I don't care where my soul goes as long as it isn't here, he's looking straight into the black nature of humanity.  It's interesting to compare the conversation Willard has at the very beginning of the movie, with the General and the CIA, in the comfort of an urban setting, with a nice lunch, silverware, calmly talking about assassinating Kurt; with the last conversation between Sheen and Kurtz in the middle of the jungle, surrounded by barbarians and death, without the first of civilization's comforts.  The General talks blandly about good and evil and the need for control, to eliminate the insane Kurtz's command. Kurtz on the other hand talks about horror--and the will to butcher, it's almost like he sees a place beyond good and evil (must have been reading his Nietzsche). The Redux version adds a few things to the original that tend to detract from the tempo and the flow, and aren't needed.  I'm still glad Coppola put it out, I find it interesting to see different versions, but for anyone who's seeing it for the first time, definitely check out the original before going to Redux.  Both are great movies, but, as others have noted, one scene seems bizarre--when Willard steals the surfboard, it's just totally out of character as is his swapping fuel for some play time with the bunnies. This is not an upbeat movie, it seems to portray humanity as a creature of nature--and not in a good way Nature comes off as teeming, brutal, endlessly damp and unforgiving, and ultimately--cruel.  Civilization is easily lost, and the better angels of our nature are mythic.  I'd expect others have different views and interpretations, which is another virtue of this movie--it's very rich and complex.  I'd suggest it to anyone who likes a thoughtful flick.

I first heard of this movie when I saw it under Roger Ebert's great movies list. I started watching this, and for a good part of it, I thought I was watching a masterpiece. In the way that it perfectly mixed images and music, and made interesting use of camera angles, and didn't follow an obvious plot, reminded me of 2001, and I thought maybe it would be just as good.  Roeg's cinematography of the sand and the sun, as well as John Barry's great music definitely deserve to be noted.  Many scenes in it are beautiful and interesting. In particular, the opening scenes of Adelaide, with the dijeridoo music, the swim scene, the sunset, and the very sad tragic mating dance scene.  I was a little confused by the way the father shot at the kids, and the kids dont say anything, but that was sort of settled when they talk about it later, so that was OK. But then the movie sort of begins to commit cinematic suicide. In the second half of the movie, the flow is definitely interrupted by scenes that have nothing to do with the characters we've been following. Like when suddenly, the aboriginie sees one white person, then there are a bunch of white people who are forcing aboriginies to work for them. And the montage of animals getting shot. But that was only a little distracting, it wasn't so bad, it just seemed to be trying a little too hard to communicate the message that Australians are hurting the environment and the Aboriginies.

Her boyfriend comes in and starts saying something about his monetary situation. The girl is gazing off. She flashes back to the swim in the desert. The John Barry music starts.  Not a bad ending, I thought; I was about to forgive the film. But then, out of nowhere, comes a narrator, who we have never heard before, reading a poem!!!  That was the last straw. The movie just overdid it. It has good ideas in it, but then it tries to make them too clear and obvious, and in the process, makes them seem almost stupid.

I was a little confused by the way the father shot at the kids, and the kids dont say anything, but that was sort of settled when they talk about it later, so that was OK. But then the movie sort of begins to commit cinematic suicide. In the second half of the movie, the flow is definitely interrupted by scenes that have nothing to do with the characters we've been following. Like when suddenly, the aboriginie sees one white person, then there are a bunch of white people who are forcing aboriginies to work for them. And the montage of animals getting shot. But that was only a little distracting, it wasn't so bad, it just seemed to be trying a little too hard to communicate the message that Australians are hurting the environment and the Aboriginies. I already got to like the environment and Aboriginies just from watching them in the movie. Those obvious scenes sort of killed the point that was already made quite well, and more subtlely.  But anyway, those aren't the worst issues. Here's what kills the film. In the end, we see the girl in her apartment, and after a whole film of being dressed messily, she is now in lots of makeup, looking very civilized. Her boyfriend comes in and starts saying something about his monetary situation. The girl is gazing off. She flashes back to the swim in the desert. The John Barry music starts.  Not a bad ending, I thought; I was about to forgive the film. But then, out of nowhere, comes a narrator, who we have never heard before, reading a poem!!!  That was the last straw. The movie just overdid it. It has good ideas in it, but then it tries to make them too clear and obvious, and in the process, makes them seem almost stupid. THE NARRATOR APPEARS OUT OF NOWHERE AND READS A POEM!!!! I just can't get over that.  ","genre":"Adventure, Drama"},{"date":"1 February 2002","score":"","review":"  I always thought that Tom Cruise was a pretty boy. I automatically hated him......then I saw his performance of Jerry Maguire, and he was exceptionally good. I then rented Magnolia, and he was good in that too, so since then I've began taking an interest in his films from MI2 through to this film - VANILLA SKY.I made sure I went into this film as cold as a turkey - I didn't want to see any trailers for the film, I hadn't read any reviews, so I didn't really hav a clue what to expect, and I'm soooooooo glad, because I think I appreciated the film far more.This film, may I say is very, very good. It has a great script - even though it's a remake, don't hold that against it! The storyline is very cleverly wrapped around one single event in David Aames' life. Cruise shines in his role, giving a performance which ranges from - dashingly smug, depressed, in complete love, confusion, frustration, etc etc. Yep, it's all here (almost!). His character goes through so much that you MUST give him credit for it.Cruz is actually very good in this film - I liked her in 'Blow' with Johnny Depp - she does well here, reprising her role from the original, and giving it a fresh new feel, and to top it all - I can UNDERSTAND what she is saying!!Cameron Diaz is equally as good, if not better as the suicidal, and crazed Julie. Her role was quite a challenge I suspect, as she could have easily gone down the one dimensional 'unhinged stalker' path and given a crap performance, but she doesn't, she keeps it controlled, and unnerving. A career performance from her in which is a vital role to the film as a whole.Kurt Russell? I've always liked Kurt, and he doesn't dissapoint here, he is strong in his role and come the end, I don't even think he knew what was happening, and to show that on screen, is truly something to behold.And finally, Cameron Crowe. He has, with this film, proved himself to be more than a 'feel good' director. He has created a world which will captivate his audience. His opening of a completely deserted Times Square is unforgettable - David Aames is a character that fears being alone, and what sense of loneliness would you feel if everything in Times Square came to a stop? Phew! But, that's just the BEGINNING! When we are drawn in even deeper to Aames' world, we are as disillusioned and as confused as he is! I won't give plot details away here, but just don't try to think too much during this film - it'll all be explained to you come the end, and if you are NOT moved to shed at least one tear, then get yourself checked into the closest asylum!!!****PLOT SPOILER - I THINK**** After Aames' tragic car crash, which some might say had it coming, we witness the 'Golden boy's' transformation, and by God is it very realistic. The make-up is great, and I never once questioned the fact that it WAS make-up. Cruise's performance and the way his 'new face' sits on him is shocking. Of course, the first initial shock of seeing him look the way he does after the accident does wear off eventually, but it does come back to haunt us as it does to David himself. Very clever.So, to conclude - this film succeeds in all levels of genre that it undertakes - romance, thriller, comedy, and even sci-fi to a degree. It has a good, strong plot coupled with strong actors and characters. Mix  all this up with a cracking soundtrack, and a director who knows what he wants and never insults his audience, and you have a film that will make you consider your everyday actions, value other people's feelings, and make one hell of a pub conversation or two.This is the best film I have seen in a long long time!!Without the sour, the sweet ain't as sweet.A good line, and one I can fully relate to!9\/10Enjoy!
