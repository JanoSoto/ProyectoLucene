I saw the movie.  I walked out of the theater wondering, what happened?  It's as if the director\/producer Mr. Lucas, never realized that the original trilogy was great not just because of the special effects, but because it was a great movie.  Compare Phantom Menace to the any one of the original Star Wars films.  In the original trilogy, there was a plot that always kept moving, always a reason to get to the next part of the film, always a level of suspense that kept the movie going.  Those movies never took 25 minutes out of the film for scenes with bland dialogue, super-cheesy acting, and no suspense, only to follow this monstrosity with a pod race which, though great in special fx, had NOTHING to do with the final outcome of the movie, the characters, or anything else that was thrown into this film. Another difference between the classic trilogy and the Phantom Menace the conflict between good & evil.  During every major fight scene in the original trilogy, there was a level of personal character conflict between the characters (Luke finding out his relation to Darth Vader, Obi-wan Kenobi meeting his old adversary and former friend, etc).  This conflict was ALWAYS more important than the external light-saber fights.  In the Phantom Menace, all we have is a big choreographed, special fx-enhanced fight between characters who we know little about.  Why are they even fighting?  Good vs. Evil I guess, but there's no conflict.  ...and since when do they use Kung-Fu in Star Wars????  In the classic trilogy, it was always traditional medevil-style sword fighting, and now it's flip-kick-jump-do-a-twirly-thing-with-your-sword. Sure, it's kinda fun to watch, but it all boils down to a fight with NO REAL REASON FOR CONFLICT.    And then there's the humor...   Here we have Jar-jar Binks, a clumsily-walking, unintelligibly-talking, alien, who has NO personality, and spends all of his time flopping around acting stupid to make the little kids in the audience laugh.  In the original movies, all of the humor came from the characters and their personalities.  Example  In Episode IV, we know that Han Solo is a somewhat laid-back, loner who seems to be only interested in money, and doesn't take orders from anyone. Princess Leia has already shown herself to be someone who is used to taking charge of a situation, and who can be sarcastic and serious at the same time.  When Han has to rescue her, there's a tremendous amount of personality conflict and witty little comebacks between the two of them. This is funny.  A five-year-old might miss the humor in the screenplay here, but it's funny.  Absolutely nowhere in the original trilogy did we have someone with no personality do dumb stuff to try to make us laugh. Also, in the original trilogy, the adventure was the key to the films success.  It was an epic adventure composed of characters who learn their destinies, and develop their relationships and personalities.  In the Phantom Menace, we know nothing about the characters personalities, because all they give us is a mish-mash of bland dialogue that doesn't develop any feelings, emotion, personality, or character whatsoever.    Phantom Menace also had little lines here & there about how bad gambling is, and how people should help eachother.  It's a good message, but it should have no place in this movie.  The first trilogy never dealt with moral issues.  It was beyond that.  In Phantom Menace, the good guys are 100% moral, and the bad guys are 100% evil.  In the classic trilogy, even most of the good guys had a darker-side;  Lando sold out his friends to Vader, only to make it up by rescuing them later.  Han and Chewie were both gamblers, and lived somewhat outside the law.  These are heroes we can relate to, because they aren't these idealist, bland, boy-scout types we see in Phantom Menace.    Also lacking in Phantom menace are a few other key elements that made the original trilogy truly classic  romance, a scene with suspense every 15 minutes, the characters' reaction to what happens, etc. All we have in Phantom Menace are incredible special effects.  It's not a classic.  It's just a light-show.  If you want plot, intrigue, character, personal conflict, and suspense, see the original trilogy on video, or buy a ticket for The Matrix.  If you've got little kids, take them to see Phantom Menace.  They'll probably like it. but as for those of us who really appreciate good movies, this is a disappointment.  The force was weak with this movie.  Try again, Mr. Lucas.

I mean everything that was done in the movie was so flawless and breathtaking that  you'd swear you can feel the force yourself!The film began with a fantastic opening showing our heroes' arrival at the planet Naboo. Then what follows are a series of adventures that not only moves the story along, but threatens to knock you out of your seat. Begining with the pod race, possibly the best, most technologically advanced, and intense footage ever filmed this side of Saving Private Ryan, everyone will love the powerful sound effects and the incredible crashes where the pods display real life inertia, they roll, break apart and crash. It's as real as it gets. Then we move along the adventure and find ourselves in the midst of four, that's right, four different battles at once. Without giving too much away, the battles break down like this The grand Gungan army in full force meets the evil droid army and duke it out Sparticus style. Our heroes, Jedi Master Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan engage in a lightsaber battle with the evil but awesome villian Darth Maul that's nothing short of exhiliarating, you will feel the hate seeping out of Darth Maul as he wields his deadly double-bladed lightsaber. Then there is Queen Amidala and her guards fighting through hordes of battle droids at the royal palace for reasons I dare not say, for I fear for my life. Then the battle takes us into space where Naboo's finest pilots engage the federation's warships. All this makes an entertaining ride not to be missed.So if you haven't already seen the Phantom Menace, make sure you go see it immediately, and if you already saw it, go see it again!

Then what follows are a series of adventures that not only moves the story along, but threatens to knock you out of your seat. Begining with the pod race, possibly the best, most technologically advanced, and intense footage ever filmed this side of Saving Private Ryan, everyone will love the powerful sound effects and the incredible crashes where the pods display real life inertia, they roll, break apart and crash. It's as real as it gets. Then we move along the adventure and find ourselves in the midst of four, that's right, four different battles at once. Without giving too much away, the battles break down like this The grand Gungan army in full force meets the evil droid army and duke it out Sparticus style. Our heroes, Jedi Master Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan engage in a lightsaber battle with the evil but awesome villian Darth Maul that's nothing short of exhiliarating, you will feel the hate seeping out of Darth Maul as he wields his deadly double-bladed lightsaber. Then there is Queen Amidala and her guards fighting through hordes of battle droids at the royal palace for reasons I dare not say, for I fear for my life. Then the battle takes us into space where Naboo's finest pilots engage the federation's warships. All this makes an entertaining ride not to be missed.So if you haven't already seen the Phantom Menace, make sure you go see it immediately, and if you already saw it, go see it again!

The second installment, The Empire Strikes Back, was even more impressive with its dark intensity, its screwball-inspired romance, and its shocking plot twists. The third episode was less satisfying, but still had something in it for everyone. The one thing that bothered me, though, was the apparent ease with which we were supposed to accept the redemption of Darth Vader, aka Anakin Skywalker, whose murderous exploits had dominated the first two films.So, with the knowledge that Lucas would produce a prequel trilogy, presumably telling the story of young Anakin and his teacher, Obi-Wan Kenobi, I was heartened. Surely, I thought, Lucas would take this opportunity to reaffirm and re-establish the hideous and horrifying Vader. We might also get to know something surprising and complex about stalwart Obi-Wan Kenobi and his possible contribution to Vader's fall. Boy, was I wrong.Instead, Phantom Menace portends a trilogy in which Vader is bound to be overly romanticized, beginning here as an innocent 9-year-old, and apparently evolving in the next film into a romantic hero with a nifty love story. Will the third film turn it all around? I doubt it. After identifying so strongly with his innocence and heroism and after rooting for his romance with the beautiful Queen, how can we help but sympathize with him even more as he begins helping the Emperor eradicate planetary systems? And what of Obi-Wan? Alas, despite his excellent portrayal by Ewan McGregor, it appears that we are to know little more about him that we knew in the original trilogy--that he trained Anakin, lost him to the dark side, and then helped the Queen hide Anakin's children.

Natalie Portman was great (apart from obvious reasons stemming from the fact that I am 14 and an adolescent male...) she acted her roles especially as Queen Amidala (when we are certain she is her) with conviction. And that voice that she used for that role... )John Williams again wrote a wonderful score and it was very Star Wars in theme.So you know you will HAVE to see it, but its just not as good as the other star wars. If you want to see another movie without an intelligent plot but with better usage of computer graphics check out Austin Powers 2, at least it is just trying to be a silly movie nothing more, nothing less...So there is my long ranting rambling essay, just go out and watch it and decide for yourself coz you just HAVE to see it even though it is a disappointment.And Yoda looks older with more hair (in my mind anyway...)

It's fascinating to watch both the transformative and destructive power of this beauty as it's placed into the hands of a sensitive young boy, a self absorbed musical protege, and a remorseful ring leader of a totalitarian regime.

Does that make any sense?Allow me to clarify.  Conceptually, Run Lola Run is a landmark and an evolutionary leap -- or least an evolutionary hop -- in the history of film. It's the first movie I've ever seen with three-dimensional and likable characters that also happens to take place in a video game universe.  It's also the first movie I've ever seen that makes a sincere, determined effort to NEVER STOP from first second to last.  Like Lola, director Tom Tykwer has a very clear and purposeful objective in mind -- to make the cinematic equivalent of the first Ramones record.  As a filmgoer who's sensitive to the importance of what he's attempting, I have one word for himOohsoclose.The idea of a maroon-haired girl streaking around Berlin like Flo Jo to the beat of incessant techno music is a brilliant one, but alas, Run Lola Run isn't what it could have been.  Most glaringly, the animation sequences are lifted from Natural Born Killers and are totally out of place.  You just cannot cut from a cartoon to the real world without jarring the audience. And this is only ONE of the problems with the editing, which would have needed a Spielberg or a Peckinpah to really sing.  For a film that lives or dies by sheer style the shot selection is awfully choppy.  It's as if Tykwer went out, shot two hundred hours of footage, and spliced it together randomly.  It's Michael Bay more than John Woo.Don't get me wrong -- this sucker is a cathartic, exhilarating rush, manna for speed freaks.  When it was over I felt like bolting out of the theater and sprinting down the street as fast as my spindly legs would carry me. In this sense it's like the best advertisement Adidas never made.  It's also the best of the recent rash of alternate universe, Sliding Doors-type movies about the fickleness of destiny.  In most of these movies there are only two possible alternatives  win the lottery or get hit by a car.  Those fates, timeless popular favorites, are duly ( and dutifully ) represented in Run Lola Run.  But if Lola blasts past you while trying to save her boyfriend be warned -- you could also end up a heroin addict, a nun, or a sadomasochist. It's good to see Tykwer embraces the glorious variety of human experience.So Run Lola Run is a lot of fun and an absolute must-see.  But ultimately, it will be most fondly remembered for having planted the seed that grew into the vine which more talented directors plucked the fruit off of.

Like Lola, director Tom Tykwer has a very clear and purposeful objective in mind -- to make the cinematic equivalent of the first Ramones record.  As a filmgoer who's sensitive to the importance of what he's attempting, I have one word for himOohsoclose.The idea of a maroon-haired girl streaking around Berlin like Flo Jo to the beat of incessant techno music is a brilliant one, but alas, Run Lola Run isn't what it could have been.  Most glaringly, the animation sequences are lifted from Natural Born Killers and are totally out of place.  You just cannot cut from a cartoon to the real world without jarring the audience. And this is only ONE of the problems with the editing, which would have needed a Spielberg or a Peckinpah to really sing.  For a film that lives or dies by sheer style the shot selection is awfully choppy.  It's as if Tykwer went out, shot two hundred hours of footage, and spliced it together randomly.  It's Michael Bay more than John Woo.Don't get me wrong -- this sucker is a cathartic, exhilarating rush, manna for speed freaks.  When it was over I felt like bolting out of the theater and sprinting down the street as fast as my spindly legs would carry me. In this sense it's like the best advertisement Adidas never made.  It's also the best of the recent rash of alternate universe, Sliding Doors-type movies about the fickleness of destiny.  In most of these movies there are only two possible alternatives  win the lottery or get hit by a car.  Those fates, timeless popular favorites, are duly ( and dutifully ) represented in Run Lola Run.  But if Lola blasts past you while trying to save her boyfriend be warned -- you could also end up a heroin addict, a nun, or a sadomasochist. It's good to see Tykwer embraces the glorious variety of human experience.So Run Lola Run is a lot of fun and an absolute must-see.  But ultimately, it will be most fondly remembered for having planted the seed that grew into the vine which more talented directors plucked the fruit off of.  Phew.I just have one question  When did Elisabeth Shue dye her hair red and learn to speak German?

But when the end credits began to roll my eyes shrunk back to normal size and I thought I have seen the future of cinema, and the future is still the future.  Does that make any sense?Allow me to clarify.  Conceptually, Run Lola Run is a landmark and an evolutionary leap -- or least an evolutionary hop -- in the history of film. It's the first movie I've ever seen with three-dimensional and likable characters that also happens to take place in a video game universe.

Bruce Willis, as bad as he wants to be, gives everything he got while playing the role of Butch. He is frustrated, angry, scared and out of is mind at the same time. Well, who wouldn't be if he had a mob like Ving Rhames tryin' to catch him... John Travolta and Samuel Jackson is the most perfect on-screen duo ever seen. Travolta, a gentleman hoodlum, tries to talk sense to Jackson, who experienced a religious awakening during a normal payback assignment. Uma Thurman plays her role like it's in her blood. She plays Mia Wallace, a drug addict and mob's wife. She kinda reminds me of Courtney Love... It is amazing, how Quentin Tarantino can make a conversation about European fast food restaurants sound interesting. Tarantino is genius, I tell you, genius. A three-hour film full of dialogue sounds boring, but this is anything but that. Damn, I shouldn't have written this. Now I want to watch it again...

At least this movie never lost my interest for a second - a very rare occurrence.While leaving the theater, I listened to the post-film chatter and did not hear a single derogatory comment.
