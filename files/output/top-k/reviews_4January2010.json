Confidential. Here is a smart, complex thriller set in 1950s Los Andreas, with compelling characters and fine director. One of the best crime films from the 90s.The focus of the film is one three main characters who are looking at three different cases. There is Ed Exley (Guy Pearce), an ambitious young officer who wants to be a detective, and has a strong moral view on justice. He gets his wise after the Bloody Christmas fiasco, and proves himself a hero cop after investigating a big murder case. But he starts to suspect things are not all right with the result. Ed's rival is Bud White (Russell Crowe), a violence cop who uses his punching and gun to beat confessions or information out of suspects. He ends up investigating two cases, on involving a massive move of heroin in the background of a organised crime leadership void. The other involves high end call girls which look like movie stars. Bud ends up getting involved with one of the call girls, Lynn Bracken (Kim Basinger). The third cop is Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey), a cop who works on the glamorous size of crime. He is a narcotics cop and a technical adviser for a TV show. He works closely with Sid Hudgens (Danny DeVito), the editor of the Hush Hush maginize. They trade information, so that Jack can make good busts, and Sid could have good stories. Jack ends up being transfered to Vice, and ends up investigating the call girls. Pictures of the call girls with Johns are being used to blackmail people like city officials. Jack also ends up working closely with Ed Exley.The script by Brian Helgeland and Curtis Hanson is excellent. They make a very complex film with strong characters who have different motivations in the backdrop of an interesting setting. They are a lot of links in the film which puts the whole thing together. They are a number of themes throughout the film, organised crime, prostitution, racism, police brutality, tabloid journalism and legal ethics. It gives you a lot to think about.As a director Curtis Hanson's career has been so-so. But L.A. Confidential shows that he has the potential to do great things. He handling of the material is excellent, he is a fan of the original novel, made excellent casting choices, keeps the film well paced and leaves no loose ends. He gets a real feel for the time and balances out both the glamour and the sleaze of the period and the city. Los Andreas itself acts as a fantasising world in itself. I also like the fact he makes out that racism was not just an issue in the Deep South and this was a period just before the Civil Rights movement started. Black people were easy targets and racism still affects America today.There is a great cast. Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce and Kevin Spacey are all great actors and all performed well. There is a good supporting with Danny DeVito (in his best role), James Cromwell and Ron Rifkin. All were on the top of their game, and must have had faith in the material. Russell Crowe's character was very true to what he is like in real life.It's a shame that Titanic swept the Oscars because L.A. Confidential was a much better film.

Michelle Pfeiffer as a Russian woman makes this Cold War tale retain its interest, and as for Sean Connery, for once he has an actual rounded character to play, complete with eccentricities, and he does it splendidly. This is a highly successful adaptation of a John le Carre novel. Of course it is all predicated on the menace of the Cold War, even though there is much talk of 'glasnost', photos of Gorbachev are now hanging on the walls, and things are meant to be loosening up in Russia. (In fact this was the first Western film ever made there.) But the Soviet Union still exists, so that this is one of the last big spy movies based upon the Soviet threat. With this film, John le Carre's spy world went out not with a whimper but with a bang. It is a rattling good tale, and well worth the watch today. The supporting actors are very good Roy Scheider, Klaus Maria Branauer, James Fox, Michael Kitchen, Ken Russell (yes, the director), David Threlfall, and others. Russell gets a bit hysterical in some of his scenes, but one would expect that from him. Brandauer has his usual magnetic intensity. Kitchen is cozy, like the sort of thing you sit in for your cuppa tea. The story itself does have some inert elements, since a group of spy masters sitting around in a control room getting remote signals all the time from Moscow is hard to make dynamic, no matter how many snide remarks they keep making to each other, and how much artificial tension is generated by ambiguous signals which confuse and worry them. One could easily pick no end of holes in the plot. But why should one? The film overcomes all these weaknesses and carries us right along. Somebody somewhere has forgotten how to make good spy stories simply, and the ones being made at the moment are generally too 'busy', leaving little room to breathe between surprises, and characters are too often two-dimensional. Here the two leads are not only written in the round (a clever script by Tom Stoppard helps!), they are played in the round by two real pros. Fred Schepisi does a wonderful job of directing. All good fun, and it really takes you back. It seems only yesterday that Red Square inspired more fear by far than the wastes of Waziristan, or whatever pale substitute for fear we are meant to be quivering about today. This film was shot on location in Lisbon, Moscow, and St. Petersburg (then still Leningrad), and there is a lot of magnificent cinematography, so that the film is partly a travelogue showing us glimpses of wonderful things. It is such a shame that they had to cut away from some of those shots in the interests of the storyline and not linger over them, such as the amazing roof in Lisbon and some glimpses of the Russian countryside, which are so tantalizingly brief.

I started watching it at twelve midnight and was expecting myself to fall asleep but thankfully it didn't because the story grips you and doesn't let go. For a movie that is two and a half hours long, it didn't have any boring bits and every scene was better than the last. The narration by the main character is neat and I really like it how he explained his life from the point he became a gangster all the way to the end. The acting was superb by everyone, famous and not so famous, because they just fitted comfortably in their roles. The actor who amazed me the most was Joe Pesci mainly since his comedy makes you laugh out loud but he also had a darker role as well. He played a gangster who would kill if he was spoken to the way he didn't like. Robert De Niro played the calm but paranoid gangster who gave money to people because they opened doors for him. Goodfellas is mainly about a boys life as he grows up and turns into a gangster. Ray Liotta plays the role exceptionally well but one thing that made me didn't like him was his annoying laugh. Martin Scorsese should have cut that part out and chucked into the lave of Krakatoa. When the film finished at two thirty, I stayed still digesting the film and was amazed by what had happened. It truly is a treasure and every DVD collector should have it in their collection. A film like Goodfellas perfectly explains a gangsters life, his marriage, his family and kids, his friends, his sins and good deeds, to the point where your brain is pouring out the information because it can't stand it. Goodfellas is the only film that has got a perfect ten from me in the last six or seven months. A masterpiece!

Ray Liotta says it like it was meant for him his whole life.This film views the mob lives of three pivotal figures in the 1960's and 70's New York. Henry Hill is a local boy turned gangster in a neighborhood full of the roughest and toughest. Tommy Devito is a pure bred gangster, who turns out to be Henry's best friend. Jimmy Conway puts the two of them together, and runs some of the biggest hijacks and burglaries the town has ever seen. After an extended jail sentence, Henry must sneak around the back of the local mob boss, Paulie Cicero, to live the life of luxury he has always dreamed of. In the end, the friends end up in a hell of a jam, and must do anything they can to save each other, and stay alive.

The acting was superb by everyone, famous and not so famous, because they just fitted comfortably in their roles. The actor who amazed me the most was Joe Pesci mainly since his comedy makes you laugh out loud but he also had a darker role as well. He played a gangster who would kill if he was spoken to the way he didn't like. Robert De Niro played the calm but paranoid gangster who gave money to people because they opened doors for him. Goodfellas is mainly about a boys life as he grows up and turns into a gangster. Ray Liotta plays the role exceptionally well but one thing that made me didn't like him was his annoying laugh.

The acting performances are great. Casting is mostly solid; obviously Branagh deserves a smarter script, and I have to wonder why they put Hannah in glasses and locked her in the stuffy secretary role.

It is almost indefinable. Directed by a Scotsman, Alexander Mackendrick, who until then had only directed comedies for Ealing Studios, it reputedly had a painful genesis according The Bad And The Beautiful Hollywood In The Fifties by Sam Kashner and Jennifer MacNair (a rather more intelligent account of various Tinseltown shenanigans than you might assume from the book's rather lurid title. Get a copy and learn all about how the gossip sheet Confidential hounded many stars, the cynical betrayal of closet gays to save the careers of other closet gays, and how many big names ratted on friends to the House Unamerican Activities Committee to save their own skin.) There were deep disagreements between its three producers and Burt Lancaster, both a producer and one of the films two stars putting the fear of God into all and sundry. The film was based on a novella by Ernest Lehman, one of the screenwriters, but every one of the screenplays he came up with was more or less rejected and golden boy playwright Clifford Odets was recruited to beef them up. Even then, director Mackendrick also had a hand in writing the screenplay and rewriting took place while some scenes were already being shot. The character portrayed by Lancaster was a thinly veiled portrait of the deeply unpleasant Walter Winchell, who tried to have the film shut down and banned. He didn't succeed, but the studio took fright, refused to promote the film and, inevitably, it flopped horribly at the box office. That is deeply ironic because it might well deserve mention in any list of the best top ten films ever made. The cinematography by James Wong Howe was, for its time, revolutionary in that he filmed on location in New York by night in natural light. I believe, in fact that more or less the whole film was shot on location. A jazz score by Elmer Bernstein features prominently, and Susan Harrison, who plays the female lead was said to be so scared by the whole production that she called time on her career at the young age of 25. That might or might not be true, but whether true or not, it gives you a flavour of the bad vibes which emanated from the making of the film. Quite apart from the film's difficulties and new approach, Sweet Smell Of Success is remarkable in that neither of the two leading players is by any stretch of the imagination a 'hero'. Both in fact, Tony Curtis's highly memorable but deeply unpleasant publicity agent Sidney Falco and Lancaster's supremely odious newspaper columnist J.J. Hunsecker &#x97; the supposed Walter Winchell character &#x97; are thoroughly despicable. Both are prepared to go to any lengths to get what they want Hunsecker will have his sister's beau framed for marijuana possession and beaten up by corrupt police in order to break up the romance and Falco manipulates the cigarette girl who is sweet on him to sleep with another columnist in order to obtain a favour. You don't watch Sweet Smell to find role models. There isn't, in fact, much of a plot &#x97; the whole point of the film is its depiction of these two lowlifes. There is not a bad performance in the film, but outstanding by a country mile is Curtis's performance as the amoral, cynical and manipulative but charming Falco. It would be unfair to claim that he carries the film because that implies others aren't up to it. But it would be wholly fair to claim that Curtis is quite simply mesmerising. You might catch this late at night on TV or at a retrospective, or you might, like me, go out of your way to buy your own DVD copy. But if you do get a chance to see this, don't miss it.

However, Kristen (who can draw others into her dreams) wills her special ability to her friend Alice. Alice soon realizes that Freddy is taking advantage of that unknown power to pull a new group of children into his foul domain.Apart from WES CRAVEN'S NEW NIGHTMARE (ANOES 7), I believe ANOES 4 is the most superior sequel in the entire franchise and I say this with zeal. Why is that? I can't help but say this film is the most imaginative, clever, and ingenious in the franchise.

Every movement, every expression shows that Albert is a woman in man's body - and it's not the makeup that makes you think that!.

Witty jokes, nice plot and absolutely outstanding actors' play. Ugo Tognazzi and especially Michel Serrault play they roles so naturally that it's hard to believe they are not gay.

However, the film is stolen from him by feisty bear hunter Will Geer and the eccentric, bald-headed Stefan Gierasch, as senior mountain men showing Johnson the ways of the wilderness.Interesting is it's depiction of Indians, in that it neither shows them as red savages or weak victims. At various times, they're portrayed as friendly, stern, and frightening.There's a lot of great detail in the muscular script co-written by John Milius and featuring many of his usual macho\/romantic themes. One scene in particular (and one of my favorites) is reminiscent of his later work in Conan The Barbarian! Much like Conan, Jeremiah is on the verge of not making it in the wilderness when he receives a life-saving gift from a dead man. With Conan, it's his sword. Here, It's the gun Jeremiah Johnson uses to hunt his food and defend himself.The final act is fairly dark and a bit depressing, with little doubt that Johnson has changed a lot during the course of the movie. The film winds down excitedly but ends on an anti-climactic note.As a kid, this was one of the first films (and the first western film) I ever saw on videocassette and it was unforgettable.

However, I believe that it should be evaluated as a film, I mean above style, content and story. Citizen Kane is a good classic, yes its direction was beyond its time by far, but nothing more. It is an interesting biography of a newspaper businessman, an interesting work, but nothing more. And as I see, critics love this film more than us, because as said, they try to evaluate it in a objective way, it promoted cinema, so a masterpiece. Orson Welles's not only Citizen Kane was beyond its time, there are some other examples, especially, the story editing of Kane is beyond its time, brilliant (the story telling method used in the movie is not similar with any movie you have ever seen, from a picture projector, Kane's life is summarized!), but generally, as a film, it is just good, a plain movie. By the way, the people who see it the greatest don't explain why it is the greatest. Because, they cannot find any reason? The film is stylish visually and in contrast with a lot of people, I forget rosebud completely while watching the movie, because it swept me away. It is not the ninth wonder of the world. The eight wonder of the world was King Kong movie and almost it was in adventure genre. I am very happy that this is not 1st in IMDb Top 250.

But, sometimes movies based upon video games can be crappy. Well, this one was more than OK. No need to tell anything except a few things... a few good things. The acting crew is great Robin Shou (Liu Kang), Linden Ashby (Johny Cage) and Bridgette Willson (Sonya Blade) were great in their parts, Christopher Lambert was fine as Rayden, but his acting was a bit wooden as always. Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa was excellent was Shang Tsung, his performance was... well somehow... inspiring. Talisa Soto (Kitana) was also good, but I really found most entertaining none else than Trevor Goddard (Kano), his Kano was very fun! His Australian accent and charisma were just solid! Love this Kano! The martial artist that played Reptile, Sub Zero and Scorpion were amazing in what they do best - kicking some butt! Fights are excellent, the atmosphere is good, the locations and studio sets were good, CGI, well not that great, but OK. It's a great fun! Watch it!
