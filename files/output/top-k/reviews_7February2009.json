When this actually happens, she must face the goblin king Jareth (David Bowie) and find her way through his labyrinth to rescue Toby before he becomes a goblin himself in thirteen hours. Along the way, she meets a variety of fascinating creatures and faces all sorts of obstacles, for Jareth will not give up the child easily in this strange world where anything is possible and nothing is what it seems.I was fortunate enough to see Labyrinth on its initial theatrical release and have been entranced by it ever since. To this day, it remains one of my favorite movies and is one of the few that I will pick up when I don't know what to watch. And now, some twenty years after its original release, my children also are enjoying the wonder that is Labyrinth. Along with The Wizard of Oz, there are few fantasy movies I would recommend as much for sheer enjoyment, and in many ways, this is a very similar movie.One of its biggest strengths is the wonderful puppetry by the Henson Company. Comprising a large part of the cast, these are really beautifully designed and skillfully used. Combined with some really excellent surreal set design, there is a great atmosphere of fantasy and unreality that is necessary for the story. Things like the Helping Hands and the staircase scene late in the movie are great.But the sets and the puppets are only part of the charm of Labyrinth. I found that the dialog in the movie, while at times a little corny, is generally witty and humorous. And the casting of Jennifer Connelly and David Bowie in their respective roles worked really well. Jennifer Connelly gave a nice performance and Bowie was incredible as the Goblin King. Shari Weiser was a good choice for the role of Hoggle too. Lots of humor and action help keep this movie rolling at a good pace so that it never gets boring.

This guy's name is Will Hunting and he is played by Matt Damon. He solves a ridiculously difficult maths problem and is found by a maths teacher at the school played by Stellan Skarsgård. And it goes from there.I think that if I had watched this movie when it was released, prior to Matt Damon and Ben Affleck's careers, I would've been able to enjoy it much more. Since they have both written the script and play leading roles in the film it's hard not to judge it with this in mind. Neither Damon nor Affleck appear to be people who would pick fights, rather they appear to be people who would avoid something like that to a large extent in order to not danger their good looks. They are very much cast against type, but that ties in with the fact that most likely one of the main reasons they wrote this script was to shape roles for themselves to launch their respective careers. I would have no problem with this, if this was a good movie, which unfortunately, it is not. Minnie Driver also is not good looking enough for her part to be believable.Gus Van Sant is one of my favorite directors, although I find his later more experimental movies - like Elephant, Paranoid Park and Psycho - much more rewarding as opposed to his earlier work which is more conventional and main stream. The main problem with this film though lies within the script, so I suppose he did what he could with what he was given in this case. For a movie to be entertaining, gripping and interesting, you need a conflict. I fail to find such a thing in this motion picture, and I did look for it the entire running time.It is a mystery as to what you are supposed to feel for the main character in this film. It is hard to feel pity for him since he himself is the main obstacle to getting what he wants, success, money, respect and so on. Many people try to help him but he fights them with all he has got. He has the personality of a spoiled brat (funny enough that in the picture this is the very opposite of what he is supposed to be A poor bastard who has had to fight his way to survive). It is also hard to identify with him since a very small percentage of the viewers of this film are geniuses who has not had to lift a finger to get where they are.It's easier to understand the problems of this movie if you compare it to a film about a similar subject which actually works. In Rain Man the main character truly is pitiful. His fate is a sad one since he is gifted but his disability has rendered him unable to interact normally with other people. The film is gripping since the viewer feels for the main character and his brother trying so desperately to reach him and find a place for him in this world.In a word you can sum up this film as plastic or fake It's a pseudo-intellectual movie of the worst sort, it tries to go deep but only scratches the surface. A positive Robin Williams does a great job with his role, he always seems to do better when he is given a serious part to play. When I saw Matt Damon in this film all I could think of was his involuntary part in Team America World Police. MATT DAMON!. Even though he was played by a doll in that film, his part seemed more real than in Good Will Hunting.

It is hard to feel pity for him since he himself is the main obstacle to getting what he wants, success, money, respect and so on. Many people try to help him but he fights them with all he has got. He has the personality of a spoiled brat (funny enough that in the picture this is the very opposite of what he is supposed to be A poor bastard who has had to fight his way to survive). It is also hard to identify with him since a very small percentage of the viewers of this film are geniuses who has not had to lift a finger to get where they are.It's easier to understand the problems of this movie if you compare it to a film about a similar subject which actually works. In Rain Man the main character truly is pitiful. His fate is a sad one since he is gifted but his disability has rendered him unable to interact normally with other people. The film is gripping since the viewer feels for the main character and his brother trying so desperately to reach him and find a place for him in this world.In a word you can sum up this film as plastic or fake It's a pseudo-intellectual movie of the worst sort, it tries to go deep but only scratches the surface. A positive Robin Williams does a great job with his role, he always seems to do better when he is given a serious part to play.

This guy's name is Will Hunting and he is played by Matt Damon. He solves a ridiculously difficult maths problem and is found by a maths teacher at the school played by Stellan Skarsgård. And it goes from there.I think that if I had watched this movie when it was released, prior to Matt Damon and Ben Affleck's careers, I would've been able to enjoy it much more. Since they have both written the script and play leading roles in the film it's hard not to judge it with this in mind. Neither Damon nor Affleck appear to be people who would pick fights, rather they appear to be people who would avoid something like that to a large extent in order to not danger their good looks. They are very much cast against type, but that ties in with the fact that most likely one of the main reasons they wrote this script was to shape roles for themselves to launch their respective careers.

One scene we are in a crappy looking mental therapy institute that looks like a cheap 70's game show set, then we are flying across grainy footage of Africa on the back of a badly animated locust, with cheap Arial clips of zebra's and buffalo spliced in all over the place probably nicked from a wild life show accompanied by some truly hilarious sound effects of wailing, which I can only assume was supposed to be disturbing! Then we find ourselves back on solid ground amidst an African village that looks like it's made out of cardboard and spray paint!

He's insane, or a bad person, although it is arguable that there are no bad men only sick men. Malick doesn't give his audience that easy way out, we see two people who are completely detached from morals but they act rational all of the time, they're even highly sympathetic and friendly. Malick shows us the true nature of evil, that it is very often ineffable. It characterizes the ambiguous nature of the homo sapiens itself, the primitive inside of us. Many people don't like this answer, namely that man isn't as civilized as they like to think and don' t have a solution for a lot of things, especially mental illness.The form in which it's presented cleverly positions itself opposite of the horrifying nature of the events.

The actual attack is both stunningly detailed and entertainingly spectacular, but even the inclusion of real stunt people so close to the explosions and actions makes a very realistic effect and helps give emotional scale to the attacks.

But the film suffers from the production code of the day; Hammett's novel holds up, and the sexual politics of it wasn't allowed to be transferred to the screen (although it could have with better writing -- Casablanca has a lot of dark sex jokes).The biggest problem with the film is Mary Astor. I don't find her attractive and her performance is mannered and oft putting -- which is a disaster for a femme fatale. In the novel, the character comes across as much prettier and smarter, and the sexual relationship with Spade makes her much more devious; it also makes the love talk at the end and Spade's rejection of Brigid logical. In the film, when this conversation starts, one is left wondering, What? These two have barely been on screen together and now there's talk of true love?One part near the end illustrates the problem with the story as filmed In the book, when Gutman claims a thousand dollar bill is missing, Spade makes Brigid get naked in the bathroom as he inspects her and her clothes to see if she took it. Brigid protests, but is not modest, and Gutman is surprised that Spade would do this. This scene reinforces Spade's cold demeanor, the sexual relationship between Brigid and Spade, and impresses Gutman with Spade's icy thoroughness. As filmed, Brigid just makes a silent, knowing nod of No, and that's that. The Hayes Code eradicated a key scene, and the writing didn't attempt to find a way to make up for this loss.If Brigid had been played by a smarter, more seductive actress and the sexual relationship between her and Spade been alluded to, then the dark motivations of the story and Spade's character would be fully realized.

Sci-fi with a message, but it seems to be uneven in the thematic department.You got a guy who's some-kind of naturalist\/botanist\/biologist on board a vessel carrying what we presume to be the last of Earth's natural habitats in pressurized domes. Things go wrong, he objects, and the events take a turn for the worse.I think what was really missing here was some more grounding for the film. Bruce Dern's character is almost a bit too passionate, suggesting a kind of mental illness. But, did the character need to be crazy to preserve the last of mother nature? Lord knows we have our militant environmentalists. But, could the script have not gone a different direction? Could Dern's character not have been more stable and gone about achieving his goal without all the hoopla? I wonder.The 70s was an awful time for the environment. Industrial pollution and pollution from cars had really done a number on land, sea and air. Something had to be done. The artistic community responded with song, paintings, a few documentaries, and Hollywood's offering was Silent Running.The gist here is that denying oneself of our natural surroundings can drive one crazy.

A little too simple and easy. But, at the same time, dramatically it works. The film is what it is, and delivers not so much a Green message, but good old fashioned conservationist message.

Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead of 1981 definitely belongs to the latter category. If a survey was held among true Horror fans, this film would certainly be one of the most frequent titles in the top ten. And for good reasons, as this low budget masterpiece is one of the most awe-inspiring, creepiest, scariest and simply amazing Horror films ever produced. The amazing fact aside that Raimi and his crew shot this with an incredibly low budget, The Evil Dead accomplishes what hardly another film has. This is easily one of the scariest, creepiest, simply terrifying Horror\/Gore films ever made. Even though this is one of the films that epitomize the term Horror, however, it is also witty and hilariously funny at times, which is something unique for a film as scary as this one. At the time of its release, the film was heavily bashed by critics for its extreme violence and gore, and censored and banned in several countries. If anything, however, the repulsion of censors and some critics helped the film achieve an instant cult-status. Director Sam Raimi instantly became known as a Horror master, the leading man Bruce Campbell became one of the most celebrated Horror\/B-movie cult-actors, and The Evil Dead has since long been recognized as a milestone of the Horror genre.The Evil Dead takes place in a world of the all-mighty H. P. Lovecraft whose amazing literary work has been the base of many brilliant Horror films. And nothing does the man's genius more justice than a cinematic masterpiece like this film. The film follows a group of friends (two guys and three girls) who want to spend a fun weekend in a remote log cabin in the woods. When they find a tape in the basement of the house, they play it out of curiosity and subsequently awaken evil spirits which possess them one by one...I do not want to give away too much, but I will say this The Evil Dead is an absolute must see for everybody even slightly interested in Horror. As mentioned above, this film epitomizes the term Horror and is extremely creepy and purely terrifying from the beginning to the end, and yet it is also funny - a combination which is, at least to this degree, extremely rare. As opposed to most films, this film's extremely morbid sense of humor does in no way lessen the constant suspense, but goes perfectly in hand with it. The gore is not only extreme, but also extremely well-made. By the time of its release, this was one of the goriest American films ever, today it proudly stands as one of the most celebrated Horror\/Gore films ever made. Bruce Campbell is the ONLY choice for the leading character Ash here. Campbell has long become a cult-figure and one of the most popular Horror actors, and while the man is great in every role he plays, he will always be Ash to his fans. The film is impressive in all regards, especially visually (even more so regarding the low budget). The brilliant cinematography contributes a lot to the films incredible scariness, the makeup is incomparably creepy and the gore effects are amazing. The film's sound effects, the voices,... there is simply nothing about this film that is not scary and simply fantastic. The film spawned two sequels so far, which are both very good, but for me this terrifying and ingenious original is still the greatest. Another sequel is planned for 2010. I've personally seen The Evil Dead countless times and I sure intend to see it countless more times. I could on praising this film forever, but I'll end this comment with a recommendation If there is a poor soul out there who hasn't seen it so far, do so immediately.

I was absolutely startled and in awe of the sheer terror of this film and blown away by Brad Pitt's performance. David Duchovny plays Brian, a struggling journalist writing a book about serial killers and their victims. He lives with his art photographer girlfriend, Carrie (Michelle Forbes), and both decide to take a trip to California to document and research the book. Unable to afford the gas and lodging Brian puts up an ad to get travel companions to share the costs. Unfortunately the ad is answered by white-trailer trash Early Grayce (Brad Pitt) and his child-like girlfriend, Adele (Juliette Lewis). As the trip goes on, Carrie becomes increasingly suspicious of Early and has every right to be. Early is a sociopathic, dirty serial killer leaving a trail of bodies along the way and under the noses of Brian, Carrie, and Adele. The film builds up with increasing speed to a violent and frightening climax that has our two characters, Brian & Carrie along for a ride to hell. There is a moment in the film when Brian asks Early why he kills and Early never answers and continues to toy with Brian. Brad Pitt, an actor who continues to sacrifice his good looks for the grittiest of roles and although Duchovny is a good actor, Pitt can act circles around him. He is so frightening and the nightmare for any woman. Early is unyielding and unflinchingly real. We see what really makes his character tick and how he reacts to his violent urges. Earlier in the beginning of the film we see his treatment towards Adele he controls her with violence and tenderness. Adele who is touchingly played by Juliette Lewis is vulnerable, naive, uneducated, and a true victim of men's violence. Adele is the victim that Brian fails to notice. It is also startling to see her in this film and that a year later she would portray a violent female prototype in Natural Born Killers. Michelle Forbes' Carrie is the opposite of the naive Adele. She is liberated, educated, and not at all blind to the brutal animal that Early is. Carrie is the true observer compared to the optimistic and analytical Brian. I was more in tuned to Carrie's character and I was fascinated by the compare and contrast of Carrie and Adele from a feminist perspective. By the end of the film, Carrie becomes the victim to Early's violent nature and Adele while meeting a tragic end becomes strong and stands up to Early no longer blind by her own naiveté. Kalifornia is quite the psychological character study.

He is so frightening and the nightmare for any woman. Early is unyielding and unflinchingly real. We see what really makes his character tick and how he reacts to his violent urges.

Adele who is touchingly played by Juliette Lewis is vulnerable, naive, uneducated, and a true victim of men's violence. Adele is the victim that Brian fails to notice. It is also startling to see her in this film and that a year later she would portray a violent female prototype in Natural Born Killers. Michelle Forbes' Carrie is the opposite of the naive Adele. She is liberated, educated, and not at all blind to the brutal animal that Early is. Carrie is the true observer compared to the optimistic and analytical Brian. I was more in tuned to Carrie's character and I was fascinated by the compare and contrast of Carrie and Adele from a feminist perspective. By the end of the film, Carrie becomes the victim to Early's violent nature and Adele while meeting a tragic end becomes strong and stands up to Early no longer blind by her own naiveté.

I was absolutely startled and in awe of the sheer terror of this film and blown away by Brad Pitt's performance. David Duchovny plays Brian, a struggling journalist writing a book about serial killers and their victims. He lives with his art photographer girlfriend, Carrie (Michelle Forbes), and both decide to take a trip to California to document and research the book. Unable to afford the gas and lodging Brian puts up an ad to get travel companions to share the costs. Unfortunately the ad is answered by white-trailer trash Early Grayce (Brad Pitt) and his child-like girlfriend, Adele (Juliette Lewis). As the trip goes on, Carrie becomes increasingly suspicious of Early and has every right to be. Early is a sociopathic, dirty serial killer leaving a trail of bodies along the way and under the noses of Brian, Carrie, and Adele. The film builds up with increasing speed to a violent and frightening climax that has our two characters, Brian & Carrie along for a ride to hell. There is a moment in the film when Brian asks Early why he kills and Early never answers and continues to toy with Brian. Brad Pitt, an actor who continues to sacrifice his good looks for the grittiest of roles and although Duchovny is a good actor, Pitt can act circles around him.

But who precisely is the man named John Doe? He might as well be called 'the man in black'. He's a dark angel on a shoulder, mine and yours, whispering truths we never care to learn. He's that little voice inside ourselves we smother by apathy. He's the anti-conscience unable to relativize the evil forces in this world. Or maybe relativizing is just a term often used to mask the fear of facing horrors we're unable to understand and overcome. So we don't even try at all. Se7en is as much a thrilling puzzle as an ambiguous morality piece. It present us with a vile world of unpunished sinners where even the biggest heroes lose the fighting courage (Somerset), and even the most driven good do-er minds are corrupted (Mills). Sound familiar? While Noir cinema clearly influences Fincher's work, Seven plays in present America, and by doing so becomes even more original and relevant.Seven at no point absolves the attrition (When you regret your sins, but not because you love God.) philosophy preached, but the movie nevertheless sparks intrigue through it by making Kevin Spacey's John Doe incredibly smart and - sidestepping the cliché- not ego-maniacal. He massacres not for fame or as an ill-aimed attempt to avenge his childhood traumas; he ends lives to prove a point. A point he's so determined to make he's willing to give up his own life in doing so. The point in question sinners deserve to die. Do they? We all carry the guilt of at least one mortal sin. Let he who is without sin throw the first stone. I feel a little soiled quoting the bible, being an agnostic. Fincher is an artist. He doesn't just state his point of view or tries to indoctrinate viewers. In most movies, everything the killer says is the opposite of the movie's message. Here, this rule does not apply. Why? Well, because the center of all that is good and pure in this movie, the young idealistic detective, succumbs to the temptations of vengeance killing. So we basically have two horses pulling in opposite direction. Ambiguous! I am firmly against capital punishment personally, but the movie does very well in studying it's characters thoroughly so their motivations ring true, twisted as they may be, they're authentic. Besides the brilliant script, Seven has many other virtues.A fault of many good movies, the fault that lowers their status from great to good, is the lack of visual attraction. Many serious drama's flaunt production values that barely rise above documentary level. If you're using an audiovisual medium, actually use it. Seven includes some terrific camera shots, Fincher follows the Noir school in making optimal use of shadows, among others in a scene where the killer's shadow looms in the rain puddle and subsequently threatens Detective Mills at gunpoint . Fincher gives a creative spin even to fairly standard thriller elements. The chase-sequence in the hallway for instance, where the camera finds itself very far from the action so we see the detective chasing a tiny silhouette. Instead of using up my thousand words listing awe-inducing audiovisual elements(which I could easily accomplish), I'll spend some attention on a curious element, namely Brad Pitt's performance.A character actor like Morgan Freeman can be compared to a singer like Frank Sinatra, he can't hit a false note if his life depended on trying to do so. Even if the end result sometimes is less than impressive, which occurs considering the multitude of roles he takes, he always saves some of the grace. Brad Pitt on the other hand received more spotlight on his looks than on his acting chops in the early days of his career. The growth process of his acting ability curves bizarrely. He performed remarkably in some early work (Kalifornia, 12 Monkeys), yet intersperses those bright bursts of talent with hammy, flat turns in Seven Years in Tibet, Legends of the Fall, and (certainly in comparison with Tom Cruise's phenomenal turn) Interview With The Vampire. My best guess? He needs a lot of direction. Why else would Fincher get such a great performance out of him in Seven and, let's not forget, Fight Club? Freeman and Pitt are star-crossed by Spacey though, who - in a surprise, uncredited, appearance - steals the movie. He plays the villain with a familiar patient smart aleckyness, it's scary to think of how much of them could be living right next door. Who hasn't got a theory that they're dying to get proved right? How many of them will get the little push that they need? As Spacey himself remarked once, people don't recognize him in foreign countries because without his glasses he looks like an ordinary accountant. He's the ideal choice for John Doe, bar none.Some critics have done injustice to Seven by naming it a by the book thriller. A by the book thriller doesn't deserve to get this much recognition. A scintillating character study embedded into a thriller plot however, that's a whole different story. Speaking of stories, the greatest script writers have always understood the ending to be the single most important part of any story. From Psycho over The Silence of The Lambs to The Usual Suspects, masterful conclusions have blown audiences away, flooding them with emotions albeit surprise or shock, anger or overwhelming sadness. This one is all of the above. And it ranks among the very best of the nineties, as does the whole film.
