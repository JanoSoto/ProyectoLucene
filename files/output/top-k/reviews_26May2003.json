It doesnt help that most of the film was shot in French, and was all of the subtitles began to give me a headache.  A good car chase scene is the only real attraction here.  Im surprised they cast DeNiro in this, it seemed more like a role for a foreign actor, maybe Gary Oldman.  Overall, this is a below average action film thats too smart for its own good.  4.5 out of 10.
