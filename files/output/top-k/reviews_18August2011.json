Pollock was far from being a graceful, mature human being, but he had the temperament and situation to embody the role of one of the best painters in the world, and thus by looking at his life, we can see what artists in the United States during the 1950s had to look forward to, and it was not a very rewarding lifestyle. The problem seems to be three-fold the level of fame of a few select artists, the lack of support for artists who struggle, and the stranglehold that privatization has over those few artists that happen to break through.

The original film is incredibly popular among fans and could now be considered somewhat of a cult classic, spawning numerous catchphrases and making the unique look of Wayne and Garth a very recognizable get-up. And then we come to it's sequel, the aptly named Wayne's World 2. This new Wayne and Garth story is stupid, silly, goofy, over-the-top, and yet really entertaining. It is set a year after the first film. Wayne and Garth are still doing their TV show, but now Wayne is starting to realize that maybe it is time to do something with his life. So he decides he is going to put on a huge rock and roll festival called Waynestock in order to prove to himself, his girlfriend Cassandra, and Cassandra's strict father, that he is capable of greatness.The original Wayne's World is absolutely one of the funniest movies ever, and it ranks very high amongst my favorite comedies. Thus, I was skeptical going into a sequel. To do the entire Wayne's World experience over again would be near impossible with the original being such a classic. I was expecting a very poor rehashing that tried to beat the original at its own game, thus being terribly unfunny. But I was mistaken in thinking this. Wayne's World 2 knows it can't outdo Wayne's World so it doesn't try to. It is its own silliness and absurdity. It has the same kind of humor as the original and the character of Wayne and Garth haven't changed and are still hilarious, but it is certainly not the original film all over again. Plus, this film is still hilarious. There are great laugh out loud moments that remind us why we love Wayne and Garth and all that they stand for. I was expecting this film to be good for no more than a chuckle or two, so one can imagine my surprise when I found myself cracking up at moments of the film.Now, all things considered, this movie is still really, really dumb. As much as I laughed, there are still the jokes that work and then the jokes that don't work. The jokes that work are hilarious, the ones that don't work are awful, eliciting a shameful rolling of the eyes from me. And then of course we have the story, which isn't anything to get excited about. It's obvious, predictable, simple, and unoriginal. But let's face it, this movie wasn't made for it's story. It's made for the jokes and the great shtick that the Wayne and Garth characters pull off. The atmosphere of Wayne's World is something very important to how the series works, and this was the more important aspect in making this a funny film, not the storyline. I could go on and on about plot, character development, structure, etc, but I would just be wasting my time. The point is, Wayne's World 2 is just here to make you laugh.Wayne's World 2 isn't a fantastic film by any means. It really can't even hold a candle to the original. But it still made me laugh and seeing Wayne and Garth in action again was great. You can't get tired of these lovable characters played so well by Mike Meyers and Dana Carvey that you just don't care how dumb the movie is. I don't see myself quoting Wayne's World 2 like I quote Wayne's World, and that's assuming I quote Wayne's World 2 ever.

Some people complain about this and granted I am not crazy about the idea of Jason not being the killer but at least they tried to be unique and you can't fault them for that.John Shepherd takes the role of Tommy Jarvis, the only repeating enemy of Jason. Shepherd does okay considering his entire role is looking stunning and terrified about everything. A deer in the headlights. He certainly lacks the leading performer quality. Melanie Kinnaman is Pamela, one of the heads at the home for wayward teens. She I suppose is the closest to scream queen for this film but her character is placid and sort of boring.

It became my favorite comedy film of all time, then. I laughed so very hard that my gut hurt the rest of the day.

There are some scenes with African Americans present, in which the slapstick is made with reference to race. It put a damper on my enthusiasm, even while I understand that any film becomes a bit of an historical reference to mirror its era. With regard to the climax of the film, I found myself forcing some laughs, as though I felt compelled to show that the scenes were still funny. At that moment, watching the scene at the abandoned building, I couldn't help but think about the children of today. And a sadness crept over me for a moment. Mad World is slowly withering, because the youngsters of today have no idea who Buster Keaton was, or Buddy Hackett, or perhaps all of those wonderful stars that made cameo appearances throughout the film. As a kid, I could instantly identify with almost every star that appeared, from Jimmy Durante in the opening scene, to Joe E. Brown, the official screaming in the crowd near the end of the film. That made it so much easier to be in the moment as each cameo popped up. I felt great about knowing them, which added to my enjoyment. Today, what kids recognize Uncle Milty? Don Knotts? Jack Benny or the Three Stooges? Even the clean slapstick is a thing of the past, just like films that are rated G, like this one. But it was still nice to see those actors pop in for their cameos, because their memories still live on, for now.

It became my favorite comedy film of all time, then. I laughed so very hard that my gut hurt the rest of the day.

While of course its not actually the final chapter by any means it does sort of tie up the first segment of the series, and begin a new turn in Jason Voorhees. It also enters the first character to become a regular in the series, a nemesis of Jason's in the form of Tommy Jarvis. Jarvis continues on in character through the next two films and personally I love a slasher series that uses a re-occurring hero as much as a villain. I thoroughly enjoyed how they opened this instalment with Jason being brought to the morgue after being apparently killed at the very end of Part 3. Its very true that if you nit pick the inconsistencies in story and characters from one film to the next you will find plenty but I also think they work very hard for a low budget horror flick series to keep continuity alive and not leave things behind. Some key performances in this one make it that much better because usually despite some okay performances the cast is sort of just casualties for Jason or a means to an end of the particular film.80's Master Corey Feldman brings the character of Tommy Jarvis to life. Feldman is terrific as the youngster who finds himself in the middle of the slaughter. He is really the first kid to be involved in the Friday franchise other than Jason himself. He brings a certain spark to the cast and is terrific. I wish he had came back for future Friday films other than small flashbacks. Quirky and eccentric actor Crispin Glover is great as Jimmy. He has this inane knack of making awkward funny and adorable and he has a charisma on screen. Kimberly Beck plays Feldman's older sister and while it might seem that she is meant to be the scream queen of this instalment she really isn't. She has a small role and doesn't get a lot of character development like Feldman does. Veteran actress Joan Freeman has a similar role as Beck as Mrs. Jarvis, Feldman and Beck's mother. Her role is significant and yet at the same time she doesn't get a ton of screen time. Camilla and Carey Moore are the eye-candy twins of the film and they fill their role appropriately. Ted White picks up the role of Jason Voorhees and I think he gives the best Jason performance to date. There is something truly ominous, angry and powerful about White's Voorhees.Exploitation, B-Movie director Joseph Zito helms this instalment and given his experience with exploitation films I'm surprised Part 4 wasn't more violent disturbing and nudity filled. I mean it probably has your typical Friday the 13th amount, although IMDb states that this film had the most nudity but I don't think that's true. What's great about The Final Chapter is they really do try to bring everything full circle. With the character of Rob Dier, they tie it together by making the brother of Sandra Dier from Part 2, they show plenty of flash backs, and clips bringing the whole together, and of course giving him a foe in Tommy Jarvis. I feel like this one could have been truly outstanding though. They could have used the Jarvis vs Voorhees angle so much better, and the kills were a little stale compared to previous entries. Still this is a great wrap up to the first part of the series before it essentially gets a little kick start into the future.

In real life he would have never acted like he does with Mario, just because he's a less educated man. At least he would have sent him a postcard. The 2nd thing is you would have never caught him in church, let alone crossing himself, as he was an atheist who had no use for religions or for any organized church and the only people in that realm for whom he ever came to feel any respect at all were the Quakers, just because they helped pay for travel tickets to Chile for thousands of Spaniards fleeing their civil war.

My reason for this is many. The Friday the 13th franchise is for horror\/slasher fans. Most of us could come back a zillion times to see Jason kill and be stopped again and again. We suspend believe and reality and let continuity in the series slide for the most part. This is one instalment that requires a suspension in the believable because it deals with a girl with psychic powers but if anyone could or should go up against something completely unstoppable like Jason it should be a psychic I think. The film features several scenes that I think are truly iconic and just very well shot. One of which is when Tina (the psychic) see Jason standing on the road just looking at her. Another is the scene where she uses her powers to choke him with the chain already around his neck. I also think the cast in this one had a lot of depth compared to some of the previous ones. You actually sort of get to know the cast of youngsters that are to be Jason's prey in this film. This film also marks the first time Jason is played by Kane Hodder, perhaps his best known portrayer.Lar Park-Lincoln is Tina. Now its true what many reviewers say, she is almost intolerably whiny, and seemingly weak until she's using her powers. But she is supposed to be pretty twisted up over essentially killing her father as a child. She's not the best scream queen but at least she has plenty of emotion to her character. Its unfortunate that the film makers made her look so ridiculous and campy when she was using her powers. Kevin Spirtas is Tina's love interest and the hero Nick. He does well, certainly has the right look for a movie hero although he never really does anything heroic, but rather runs around looking for Tina most of the film. Veteran character actress, director, sound editor and voice over queen Susan Blu plays Tina's mother. She has had a long career doing voice overs for cartoons but she does a great playing the concerned mother in this film. She looks the part and actually gives one of the strongest performances in the film. Also a veteran character Terry Kiser is also good in a campy sort of way as the villainous self involved pompous doctor. Its definitely enjoyable to see him get his end. Susan Jennifer Sullivan in one of her (surprisingly so) only roles. She plays the snotty cheerleader type Melissa and she does well. The rest of the prey for Jason are actually pretty decent but nobody truly stands out against the main cast. Kane Hodder picks up the role of Jason again and truly hones the character and makes him what he is. You think the role of Jason could be played by anybody given how many people have portrayed him but Hodder is dead serious in this role and his supernatural strength is just really something to watch.A director and special effects man takes the lead for this film, John Carl Buechler. His foray into special effects is easy to see as we see a lot of different effects given the psychic angle of things. I think the film makers really tried here with this film. I feel like they wanted to really try and give this one a story, and more depth and for the most part they succeed. You still have the Crystal Lake setting and the unsuspecting campers but a totally different adversary.

The suggestion that it was one of the hottest days of the year seemed to point toward an eventual outburst in which one or more characters would eventually reach their own boiling point, resulting in some form of violence.Lee directs himself as one of the principal players named Mookie, an employee of Sal's (Aiello) Famous Pizzaria. There's a dichotomy in the portrayal of Sal's two sons - Pino (John Turturro) is inherently racist, but doesn't expose those feelings openly, as he realizes he has to live and work in the neighborhood. Vito (Richard Edson) however, has no trouble showing friendship with Mookie, and as the younger brother, appears to be more tolerant with the diversity around him. In the middle in terms of temperament is Sal, having lived and built a business in the community for twenty five years, and coming to realize that the predominantly black community is basically decent and supportive of his shop.I'm not clear why Spike Lee would have presented so many of his characters as borderline delinquents. A white director using the same prescription would undeniably be viewed as racist. However his intent, if it was to portray a poor black neighborhood plagued by unemployment and lack of opportunity, was an effective way in which to advance the story to it's flash point. At that moment though, I was jarred by the action of both Sal AND Mookie. Granted, we knew Sal could be a hothead, but destroying the boombox was stepping over the line. Mookie's response likewise, by throwing a garbage can through Sal's window seemed totally out of character. I'm sure the unintended consequence of what followed was the main part of the message Lee was attempting to convey, that is, violence for the sake of violence can never be an answer because it produces victims in it's wake. I would have said innocent victims, except Radio (Bill Nunn) had some culpability in what happened to trigger the riot, but he didn't have to die as a result, even if by accident.Interestingly, Lee establishes the neighborhood old timer, Da Mayor (Ossie Davis) as the voice and conscience of Bed-Stuy, someone who's been around the block a few times and realizes he can role model good behavior for the youth of the community. Da Mayor was the picture's 'do the right thing' guy, but it's all the wrong things that happen in the story that force the viewer to examine one's own prejudices and sympathies. Do the Right Thing is the kind of film that leaves one with more questions than answers, which can be a good thing if those questions lead to an honest examination of why differences among people shouldn't get in the way of standing on common ground.

The reason is that the time spent in Manhattan is virtually nil. The last half hour is actually in New York considering how much time is spent hyping it up like its Jason lose in the big city (which is an interesting concept I think.) But this is about Jason lose on a boat of High School graduates on their way to New York. It takes the typical Crystal Lake location and mixes it up by putting him on a boat and then truly mixes it up by dropping him into the biggest city in North America. Such intense change in setting is welcomed and interesting and makes the kills that much more fun. This is also the first time I felt like they added a hint of humour to the series with Jason showing his face to some gang bangers to get them to back off. It also has my hands down favourite Friday the 13th kill ever and perhaps the most ridiculous with the boxer on the roof when Jason takes his head clear off with a hook after being punched multiple times. The characters haven't changed much over the course of eight Friday the 13th films but the setting is what makes this one more fun than the average instalment.Jensen Daggett is our latest scream queen and this was her premier role. She is good as Rennie, the emotionally distraught Graduate whose parents were killed, and who was traumatized as a child by nearly drowning. She has that typical deer in the headlights scared of everything performance we have come to know of the lead female in the Friday the 13th series. Barbara Bingham plays Rennie's teacher and one of the only adults in the film and she is a great character but they don't give her enough screen time. A legendary television actor, Peter Mark Richman plays Principal Charles McCulloch. His character is one of the best and he does a great job in the role. Scott Reeves is the young love interest and hero. I think he is actually one of the best actors that played this type of role in the series. He actually has personality and a strong charisma on screen. And its only right that I mention Vincent Craig Dupree who plays the previous mentioned Boxer who doesn't get a lot of screen time but he is good when he's on screen. Kane Hodder picks up the hockey mask again and proves why he is the best at being Jason. His movements are just so defined and perfect for Jason.Another man from the Friday the 13th TV Series takes the helm, Rob Hedden. He also co-write Jason Takes Manhattan and I think these directors that truly care about this series want nothing more than to try and really give it a story because Jason Takes Manhattan tries very hard to actually have a solid plot amongst the insane deaths and kills. The one thing I could have done without entirely was the constant flashbacks to Jason as a child and the ending which for some twisted reason as Jason melting down back to being a child again. IMDb writers pass this off as visions by Rennie but even still it comes across as ridiculous.

Maybe if you take it for what it is, at a surface level, it might work...but once you start digging a little deeper and actually think about what you've just watched...it's not that great of an ending.I'll give it some credit for trying to go a different way than most movies of its type do, but that's about all I can really give it credit for. The movie itself was just really slow and didn't really pay off in the end, in my opinion, anyway.I'd give it maybe a five out of ten. That's about all the more I think it deserves. It wasn't GREAT, it wasn't HORRIBLE...it was just OK.You can check it out if you want to, but I wouldn't go so far as to say I'd recommend it. Take that for what it's worth coming from an anonymous movie reviewer. ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery"},{"date":"18 August 2011","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Oliver Stone won his third Oscar with this fantastic film Born on the Fourth of July, based on the autobiography written by Ron Kovic who was left in a wheel chair after being wounded in the Vietnam War. His previous two Oscars had been for his screenplay for the powerful Midnight Express in 1978, and for Platoon in 1986. Stone was deserving of his Oscar for this film, which also seen Tom Cruise pick up a nomination for his amazing performance as Ron Kovic. I wouldn't usually be a fan of Tom Cruise. However, in saying that, I wouldn't hate the man like a lot of people seem to do. I generally would view him as a good actor at best, nothing brilliant. His powerful performance as Ron Kovic in this film is without a doubt the greatest performance of his career. He only lost out on the Oscar to a more worthy recipient - Daniel Day Lewis for his unbelievable performance as Christy Brown in My Left Foot.Oliver Stone had been trying for years to make this film, and at one point even, Al Pacino had been cast in the lead role as Kovic. However, production fell apart and finally, in the late eighties, Stone - with the success of Platoon behind him and two Oscars - got back to Kovic and they wrote the screenplay together. In the film, we see Kovic growing up in the typical, happy, patriotic American suburban home in the fifties with his strict Catholic morals and WW2 veteran father. A very fit and athletic young man, Kovic joins the Marine Corps after high school, determined to do a tour of duty in Vietnam - to do his bit for his country to stop communism spreading. He tells his parents that he will die over there if he has to. Two years later, and he's a sergeant on his second tour, and by now, he has seen horrible things and made some terrible mistakes that will haunt him for the rest of his life. In 1968, in a firefight, he is shot in the chest and the bullet severs his spine, making him paralysed from the mid-chest down. After a horrible stay in a veterans hospital in the Bronx resembling a hell on earth, he returns home to his family, and as the war keeps coming back haunting him, along with his frustrations caused by his disability and the hostility from the anti-war movement, Kovic becomes broken and disillusioned, and feels betrayed by the country he fought for and joins the anti-war movement...Watching this for maybe the fourth time last night, I couldn't help but feel how relevant and powerful this film is today - more than it ever was back in 1989. With the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, there are many young men like Kovic returning home from war in wheelchairs, maimed etc. and who probably feel the same frustration and hopelessness that Kovic felt. So that's why I think this film is important for todays generation. It's inspirational, sad and very powerful. Tom Cruise is amazing in the lead role, and his transformation from a patriotic, gung-ho young man into a broken, scruffy shell of a man who feels like his country has betrayed him and who finds comfort in drink and prostitutes was very well tracked out, and this is all thanks to the wonderful editing that also earned the film an Oscar. John Williams provides a very rousing score, and Oliver Stone at the helm as usual does an amazing job. The Vietnam scenes were fantastic and they really stand out against other Vietnam films because they don't take place in the jungles, but instead on the beaches and later on, where Kovic gets wounded, in a barren, sun scorched field. The lighting was superb here, as we get the immense feel of a heavy setting sun as all these scenes are in orange and red effect, which cast some beautiful silhouettes. The sound is excellent, and the cinematography is just superb. The acting is brilliant all round, with supporting performances coming from Frank Whaley, Raymond J. Barry and Caroline Kava as well as a superb performance from Willem Dafoe in the last part of the film. Watch out for small appearances from Stephen Baldwin, Tom Sizemore and Tom Berenger. With his Vietnam trilogy, Stone covered all the main aspects of the war - the war for the average infantrymen with Platoon, the coming-home aspect of it with this film, and also, from the average Vietnamese peasant with Heaven and Earth. A great director who has since been the subject of a lot of criticism for his films of late which general opinion thinks he is beginning to lose his touch, but I still think he is a great director and is somewhat underrated. Born of the Fourth of July is a long enough film but it doesn't feel like it, thanks to the excellent editing and well-written screenplay. It's a masterpiece... really is; the true-story of a naive young man who went to war determined to fight for his country, and who came home broken mentally and physically before over-coming the world around him and becoming a loud and inspirational voice for the beaten and disenchanted of an entire nation.

It cruelly, yet accurately represents Hollywood in the same way that Citizen Kane so cruelly and accurately represents the world of business. Sunset waste no time. It throws us straight into the middle of what appears to be a mystery, but soon becomes a tragedy, and perhaps even an allegory of Old Hollywood meeting New Hollywood and not liking it one bit, a story of unwelcome but necessary progression. We meet Joe Gillis (William Holden) within seconds of the opening credits. The twist? He's a dead. Shot and floating in a swimming pool - a pool that he has always wanted (perhaps even more than to be a writer). Joe then starts to narrate, telling us how he came to be in the pool. He was a down and out writer, living in a small flat with debts to pay. One day the debts catch up and he finds himself making a run for it. He winds up taking a wrong turn into the grounds of an old house. That house is owned by Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), a middle aged actress who is past her prime but refuses to accept it and move on with her life. This is where Joe's nightmare begins, as he is effectively held captive, desperate for money, by a woman who is desperate for admiration and love and who will give anything for it, and in the end do anything to prevent the illusion from collapsing on front of her. This is where we see for the first time, that Norma could represent Old Hollywood (the past), whilst Joe could represent New Hollywood (the future). Norma and Old Hollywood are stuck in their ways. They hate the idea of progression, hate new talent, hate anything that changes the status quo and could go on to destroy them. So they becomes desperate, they take more and more desperate measures, they lure Joe and us with false promises of greatness, they bribes us. They will even take cruel punishment if it means that we and Joe will still sit there and pay attention. Norma begs Joe to hit her, rather than to hate her, and will bribe him with everything - just like Hollywood will take the remarks of critics if it means that audiences will keep going back, or it will gives us the likes of Transformers 3, a Spiderman reboot or anything that can give the illusion that it still has the answers, the talent.Because nothing scares Norma more than a lack of audience, and the same can be said for Hollywood. Of course, Joe and New Hollywood, they want progression. They, like us, hate the lack of progression, hate the repetitiveness, hate the way they and we are left in the cold when we know that we can do better. Norma thinks she still has it - but Joe knows the truth. She has had her day and needs to bow out gracefully to allow progression. At the moment, Hollywood still thinks it has it. But we know the truth - cinema numbers have fallen, and Hollywood is relying too heavily on reboots, comebacks, sequels and prequels. There is nothing original. There is little to no progression. In Sunset, the desperation in Norma turns to a jealous, uncontrollable rage that results in her essentially going mad and, SPOILER, shooting Joe dead to keep him hers and maintain her illusion that she is great. Hollywood, in desperation, doesn't shoot us dead, but does bombard us with explosions, special effects, promising adverts and violence that mask the fact that most films are no longer great, but just routine and are in desperate need of new, refreshed talent. Of course, even after all the trouble Norma causes, Joe tries hard to like her, to understand her, to make excuses, to protect her from the truth. He knows that she was a star, and at first even thinks there is a chance she could be again. And again, that can be said of us with Hollywood. We love Hollywood, not because of what it is, but because of what it once was and could be again in the right hands. We don't want to let a bright start fade. We want it to be great, so we put up with Michael Bay's Transformers, with a Spiderman reboot, with a poor remake of classics, because we hope that Hollywood will get its act together and make something bigger and better. Perhaps that final shot, where Norma reaches towards the camera, is Hollywood reaching for us in desperation?I'm not sure whether Wilder wanted to make this a film about failed stardom, or a metaphor for Hollywood. But it is a true testament to he and the cast that we can take the film literally or metaphorically, and still still be touched by it.

As the latest Tommy Jarvis states He's back and stronger than ever. You actually do notice a difference between Jason Voorhees #2-4 and the Jason of Part six and that's significant. His strength is terrifying and brutal and makes his kills a little less original but far more brutal. The film makers actually try and explain why and how he's returning this time and even sort of where this new brutal Voorhees gets his strength from. I also think this is one of the better endings to the films. Instead of killing this creature which after six films, and multiple years you'd think someone would think of an alternative. While finally Tommy Jarvis does, however short-lived his solution may be.Thom Mathews takes over the role for the third and final time as Tommy Jarvis. Mathews is good, much better than John Shepherd in A New Beginning was but still not as good as Corey Feldman in Final Chapter. Mathews is stronger in the role, and more leading man quality but still doesn't quite fit the bill. Jennifer Cooke is our scream queen this time around and she is quite good in the role. She's the defiant Sheriff's daughter, and she has a sexy spark to her character. I mean given they don't give her a lot of depth but she does well with what she's given. David Kagen is also good as her father and the local Sheriff. I think he comes across as a little bit campy from time to time but in a film like this that always works. And then of course you have your host of victims each with a little bit of personality but nothing that will ever catch your eye. Jason Voorhees this time around is played by C.J.

Rather than the movie looking out of date, the fact that the crude 1951 technology looks so antiquated today helps make the point of the movie humanity's conceit looks childish in the larger cosmic perspective. Multiply the way 1951 technology looks to us in 2011 times 100 or 1,000 and you begin to get some idea how we must look to an advanced galactic civilization. When this movie was released, televisions were just appearing in American homes, the transistor had been invented four years before and was not in any consumer products, jet planes were limited to the military, and the atomic bomb was marking its sixth birthday. The first satellite was still six years in the future. Man travel to the moon? Maybe in the 21st century.Yes, we've made enormous technological progress in 60 years, and now nearly everyone has a cell phone, or a laptop or an HD TV! How puny we would seem next to a civilization with thousands or even millions of years of scientific progress, instead of our mere 500. And then there were the rash of UFO sightings, including headlines across the nation of a crashed UFO recovered in Roswell, New Mexico in 1947, based on a military press release quickly retracted. What if a UFO did land, say, in Washington, D.C.? People couldn't help but wonder. Bosley Crowther in his New York Times review of Sept. 19, 1951 was not impressed, seeming to prefer the thrills and action of H.G. Wells' War of the WorldsIt is comforting, of course, to have it made plain that our planetary neighbors are much wiser and more peaceful than are we, but this makes for a tepid entertainment in what is anomalously labeled the science- fiction field.Crowther, it seems, did not want to face the issues head on, and did not understand the essence of modern science fiction, which is less about technology than about questions of human nature, society and even spirituality, set in some science fiction future. In other words, it is supposed to make you think outside the box of your little reality.Sadly, humanity seems to have made little progress in the social or spiritual realm over the past 60 years. For awhile, it seemed we were learning to cooperate among nations to address our problems, but now it seems more like things are flying apart. Could we call a meeting of all heads of state to meet with a visitor from another planet today? Well, there are some that seem preoccupied with civil wars at the moment. And there are others who are corrupt, or who are hopelessly mediocre and incompetent. With the perspective of 60 years, it is clear why UFOs would not want to land and meet our leaders then, and why they still would not, today. Humanity must seem like so many childish fools for being unable to face facts and cooperate to solve our imminent and urgent problems. The Day the Earth Stood Still is a classic, but it got some basic science wrong. That an advanced space ship would take five months to travel 250 million miles is pretty pathetic. That's about the distance to Mars. (The next Mars rover, Curiosity, will take 255 days to travel the 354 million miles to Mars at a leisurely 58,000 mph, or 16 miles per second.)Yet in the opening, we see vistas that seem to represent the view from the spaceship as it travels to Earth, and these include a view from a distance of our galaxy, which is far more than 250 million miles. It would have been more realistic to talk of billions or trillions of miles, or of light years, but for a time when we had not yet even sent a rocket into space, this might have been too hard to grasp.The interior of the spaceship is pretty cool. (I'm not sure what I would do in there for five months; where's the bed and kitchen and AV console? Did Klaatu play gin rummy with Gort for the entire trip? Barbarella's shag-carpeted RV spaceship looks like more fun.) Reportedly, it was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. The Bernard Herrmann score also holds up surprisingly well. Some people gripe that Hugh Marlowe's performance is stiff. But his character was an insurance salesman; he's a conservative with little imagination. I've seen plenty of people like this over the years, and Marlowe got it right. The aliens had the last laugh. Flying saucers were observed flying in formation over Washington, D.C. the next year, on radar and in photographs, apparently in a case of reality imitating art. It got front page headlines in the Washington Post. Wikipedia has an article, 1952 Washington D.C. UFO incident. There were numerous other sightings around the nation in 1952, and reports of a possible shoot down order if the UFOs did not obey orders to land. Yeah, right. One part of the movie does look especially quaint today, and that is the threat to destroy Earth if we did not learn to live together in peace. We don't need some outsiders threatening us; we are quite capable of destroying our planet all by ourselves through global warming. Our planet seems to have a built in self-destruct mechanism if we fail to learn to cooperate to solve our problems. This time, I'm afraid, simply repeating Klaatu barada nikto won't cut it, though it's worth a try.Trivia Klaatu takes the name John Carpenter when he leaves the hospital, an ironic choice in light of the story, with the initials JC matching the founder of Christianity, who was a carpenter. Then, 33 years later, another movie about a visitor from space, Starman, was directed by John Carpenter.

Rather than the movie looking out of date, the fact that the crude 1951 technology looks so antiquated today helps make the point of the movie humanity's conceit looks childish in the larger cosmic perspective. Multiply the way 1951 technology looks to us in 2011 times 100 or 1,000 and you begin to get some idea how we must look to an advanced galactic civilization. When this movie was released, televisions were just appearing in American homes, the transistor had been invented four years before and was not in any consumer products, jet planes were limited to the military, and the atomic bomb was marking its sixth birthday. The first satellite was still six years in the future. Man travel to the moon? Maybe in the 21st century.Yes, we've made enormous technological progress in 60 years, and now nearly everyone has a cell phone, or a laptop or an HD TV! How puny we would seem next to a civilization with thousands or even millions of years of scientific progress, instead of our mere 500. And then there were the rash of UFO sightings, including headlines across the nation of a crashed UFO recovered in Roswell, New Mexico in 1947, based on a military press release quickly retracted. What if a UFO did land, say, in Washington, D.C.? People couldn't help but wonder. Bosley Crowther in his New York Times review of Sept. 19, 1951 was not impressed, seeming to prefer the thrills and action of H.G. Wells' War of the WorldsIt is comforting, of course, to have it made plain that our planetary neighbors are much wiser and more peaceful than are we, but this makes for a tepid entertainment in what is anomalously labeled the science- fiction field.Crowther, it seems, did not want to face the issues head on, and did not understand the essence of modern science fiction, which is less about technology than about questions of human nature, society and even spirituality, set in some science fiction future. In other words, it is supposed to make you think outside the box of your little reality.Sadly, humanity seems to have made little progress in the social or spiritual realm over the past 60 years. For awhile, it seemed we were learning to cooperate among nations to address our problems, but now it seems more like things are flying apart. Could we call a meeting of all heads of state to meet with a visitor from another planet today? Well, there are some that seem preoccupied with civil wars at the moment. And there are others who are corrupt, or who are hopelessly mediocre and incompetent. With the perspective of 60 years, it is clear why UFOs would not want to land and meet our leaders then, and why they still would not, today. Humanity must seem like so many childish fools for being unable to face facts and cooperate to solve our imminent and urgent problems. The Day the Earth Stood Still is a classic, but it got some basic science wrong. That an advanced space ship would take five months to travel 250 million miles is pretty pathetic. That's about the distance to Mars. (The next Mars rover, Curiosity, will take 255 days to travel the 354 million miles to Mars at a leisurely 58,000 mph, or 16 miles per second.)Yet in the opening, we see vistas that seem to represent the view from the spaceship as it travels to Earth, and these include a view from a distance of our galaxy, which is far more than 250 million miles. It would have been more realistic to talk of billions or trillions of miles, or of light years, but for a time when we had not yet even sent a rocket into space, this might have been too hard to grasp.The interior of the spaceship is pretty cool. (I'm not sure what I would do in there for five months; where's the bed and kitchen and AV console? Did Klaatu play gin rummy with Gort for the entire trip? Barbarella's shag-carpeted RV spaceship looks like more fun.) Reportedly, it was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. The Bernard Herrmann score also holds up surprisingly well. Some people gripe that Hugh Marlowe's performance is stiff. But his character was an insurance salesman; he's a conservative with little imagination. I've seen plenty of people like this over the years, and Marlowe got it right. The aliens had the last laugh. Flying saucers were observed flying in formation over Washington, D.C. the next year, on radar and in photographs, apparently in a case of reality imitating art. It got front page headlines in the Washington Post. Wikipedia has an article, 1952 Washington D.C. UFO incident. There were numerous other sightings around the nation in 1952, and reports of a possible shoot down order if the UFOs did not obey orders to land. Yeah, right. One part of the movie does look especially quaint today, and that is the threat to destroy Earth if we did not learn to live together in peace. We don't need some outsiders threatening us; we are quite capable of destroying our planet all by ourselves through global warming. Our planet seems to have a built in self-destruct mechanism if we fail to learn to cooperate to solve our problems.

I'm sure you would feel a lot better!Things must be really, REALLY BAD in England if your entire sense of self-worth is wrapped up in rage over a Hollywood movie set more than 60 years ago. I know things haven't been too good for the United Kingdom since the bumbling appeasement of Adolph Hitler by your democratically elected Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain led to the loss of your colonial empire of unarmed third world countries, but you can't blame America for everything. Don't you have more important things to worry about than a fictional movie about a submarine, like whether it is time to replace David Cameron with someone who knows his ass from his elbow?Although the story of U-571 is fictional, there was, indeed, a war called World War II, and Americans did, indeed, capture a German sub with an Enigma machine, which doesn't mean that British sailors didn't capture one, too. Germany had lots of subs.Does anyone in Britain, Mexico, Denmark, etc., know what the term fiction means?If a movie is historically accurate it is called non-fiction, or sometimes a documentary or re-enactment. A movie that is FICTION is, by definition, not historically accurate; it is about something THAT NEVER HAPPENED. U-571 doesn't claim to be true; it is fiction. There was no German U-571. Somebody made this story up; he is called a writer, for example, Stephen Ambrose. He gets paid to write screenplays that entertain us. A person who writes about history is called a historian. He gets paid for not making things up, like David McCullough.Complaining that a fictional movie is not historically accurate is like complaining that pizza is not fried chicken. If you want pizza, order pizza, and don't go complaining to the restaurant after you get it that it's not fried chicken. Or to put it in more Anglo-friendly terms, if you want bangers and mash, don't order fish and chips!I suspect that a lot of the negative reviews are by people who didn't actually watch the movie, or at least didn't finish watching the movie. They are certainly by people who confuse current events with history, and because they don't like America's recent foreign policy and military actions, they criticize America over fictional movies about World War II. Makes sense to them. I'll bet these people, most likely children, know next to nothing about the real history of World War II. If they did, they wouldn't be confusing a Hollywood adventure film with historical fact.The British reviewers complain that they were the ones who captured and broke the Enigma machine code, and U-571 hurts their feelings because it shows Americans capturing an Enigma machine. If you bothered to read anything about the real history of the Enigma machine, you would know that Polish cryptographers were the first to crack the German Enigma code in 1932, and they presented a smuggled Enigma machine along with their code-breaking techniques to the British shortly before WWII started. If you want to know more about the true history of the Enigma machine and the actual historical capture of submarine Enigma machines, just watch the ending of U-571; it is in text just before the credits. Or try Wikipedia or the Encyclopaedia Britannica. One of the things you will learn is that the British and the Americans both recovered enigma machines from German subs, including U-505. Yes, Britain, there was more than one Enigma machine in the world. These incensed reviewers complain about U-571 not being historically accurate, but then they go making up a bunch of patriotic British bosh and posting it as historical fact, when actually they don't know what they're talking about. At least U-571 doesn't claim to be true, unlike these reviewers. As to the accusation that U-571 is a knock off of Das Boot, well, this must be so because they are both set aboard submarines in WWII and they both begin with farewell parties, though there do seem to be some minor differences, such as that Das Boot was about a German submarine crew, and U-571 was about an American submarine crew, and most of the crew of Das Boot die when they are bombarded by Allied planes.

If Caddyshack can make a dull sport like golf funny, I'm waiting for Queballs or even Strikes to bring some excitement to the world of billiards or bowling.Caddyshack has an all-star comedy cast, but they seem to work best on the green rather than at dinner or out in the world. Bill Murray, Ted Knight, Chevy Chase, and Rodney Dangerfield are the funniest in this film when they are making snarky remarks at each other while trying to enjoy a game of golf, a game that is known for its calming, stress-free nature. The problem, is Caddyshack tries to concoct a love story between multiple groups and keeps trying to nudge its characters off the field. When you have a good cast that works well in a designated area why shun them away from that area? I would've been perfectly content with a movie that where more than half of it takes place on a golf course. Just as long as it featured the comedic talents of these four guys.There really is no plot either. Just well-developed characters that sustain the entire movie. There's Ty (Chase) the most laidback person in the world. Carl (Murray) the grounds-keeper of the course who spends most of the film trying to exterminate a pesky gopher who distracts other players. Al (Dangerfield) a rich real estate cad who does nothing but boast the whole film in his vulgar, yet undeniably hilarious ways. And, finally, Judge Elihu Smails (Knight) the co-founder of the course.If you take four parrots, caged them up for days without letting them out, then released them in a room with each other they would go nuts and frolic forever. That's exactly what Chase, Dangerfield, Knight, and Murray. They unleash each one of their special qualities out on the film. Which is what makes Caddyshack so funny and so memorable.

Caddyshack isn't marketed as a parody film, but it does bring comedic jokes about the game of golf and just makes it funny in its entirety. It doesn't go on a rampage trying to get as many references in as possible, but it winds up accomplishing more than any modern day spoof.If the Direct-to-DVD National Lampoon series now among us took time to pay closer attention to worthless things like writing, casting, and humor, they could maybe pull off something like Caddyshack. Instead, they choose the easy way out by putting some bikini girl on the DVD cover hoping people will see this as an American Pie raunch-fest, when really, it's PG-13, and if it is R rated, it has very little to offer.Caddyshack doesn't try to hard and it still succeeds.
