First off  NOTICE the fact that we never see a president (when you see a glimpse, he is out-of-focus).  This is important, because this movie is attacking the position of a president and what costs an administration may go to ensuring success and good PR.  Director Barry Levinson and David Mamet have used the all-powerful media to wag us, and gives you the impression that we always have and always will be wagged.This film works so well because of the fantastic script, but also, because of the rich characters involved.  De Niro and Hoffman have such juicy roles, their characters even have their own trademark lines  Hoffman- This is nothing!, De Niro- I'm working on that.  Hoffman's producer is based on real-life producer Robert Evans allegedly, and judging by how he plays him (silly glasses, veggie shakes), they must not have seen eye to eye in the past.  He deserved his Oscar nomination, and De Niro inhabits Conrad Brean, the fixer, so well, you almost long to have a job like his.  Create smokescreens from the hip. That is what he is always working on.The supporting cast is highly memorable.  Heche is sexy and solid, and Denis Leary as the fad king, spills out his dialogue like a runaway train.  So many reporters, anchormen, etc. echoed this movie when Clinton's 'firefly' incident hit the country just FOUR months after its release.  What the spin doctors do in WAG THE DOG cannot be that far off.  I don't think they created a war, however, if they happened to do what Hoffman and co. do here, why wouldn't we fall for it?  Our source is the media.  We believe most of what we SEE. De Niro as Brean is quick to point this out.  In one scene, he says the first draft of the Warren Commission says Kennedy was killed by a drunk driver.  Would the public have bought it?  Who knows? Probably.The film flows smoothly and the witty dialogue and situations make you laugh.  It is important because of its slanted accuracy to our current presidency and also slightly eerie.

That is precisely why Pulp is so popular with audiences and critics, the time has come for a new breed of film within the industry.  There are a number of elements which makes Pulp Fiction one of the best and most important films in Hollywood.Something that is very original about Pulp Fiction is of course its structure.  It is both a narrative and non-narrative film at the same time. Tarantino takes on the roles of a novelist and a filmmakers, simultaneously. He tells three stories instead of the conventional single story and they are told through a number of perspectives.  This makes the film much more interesting than usual and it tightens the shared universe that all the characters dwell in.Tarantino's film is not meant to be a parody like many interpret it.  It is supposed to represent real-life.  The film's structure is circular; the film ends where and when it began to represent the perpetual crisis of life, the unending conflicts that exist within the reality we live in.In fact, Tarantino emphases this point by attacking the Hollywood interpretion of life and displaying a conflict and contrast within that. Tarantino stereotypes many elements of his film to that of the conventional Hollywood presentation.  He typifies the crime genre with his characters (2 washed-up hitmen, the crime boss, the crime boss's wife), their costumes (black, sullen), the violence, the death, the drugs.  We see it all but then it is all twisted out of its conventional shape.  The hitmen do not talk like usual hitmen displayed on film.  They talk of TV pilots, toe massages and filthy animals.  And even though they start out in the typical gangster situation with an assigned murder and retrieval of some goods, we then follow them for the rest of the day, instead of abandoning that story right then and there.  We see conflicts and situations arise that are very unexpected and unusual for men such as these.  Both their language and situations are atypical of their stereotype.  We see that people of this constructed, everyday world do not go through a formula of life, they experience life in a seemingly unplanned fashion, just like real-life.And when you look at Pulp Fiction nowadays, it has the very appealing retrospective ensemble cast.  What I mean by this is that now everyone in it is a big star but back in 1994, they weren't all that they are now.  John Travolta was wash-up and Pulp redeemed his career, Samuel L. Jackson was not well known, Bruce Willis had come off a bunch of box-office bombs like The Bonfire of the Vanities and Mortal Thoughts, Uma who?, Ving Rhames was a vitual unknown, Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer are purely creations of Quentin Tarantino, Eric Stoltz was trapped in the 80s teenage genre.  In fact, Harvey Keitel was probably the only star but his character in the film was purely a creation of Hollywood and maintained that way throughout.  This film still has a lot of appeal when you look at the cover box in a video story nowadays because it has this huge cast.Tarantino's direction is also not that larger-than-life style that you are used to in a big Hollywood film.  He lets his actors live and really indulge into their characters.   He lets action take shape and remain on screen longer than would be expected such as Jules taking a long sip from a Big Kahuna coke or Butch walking to his apartment to retrieve his gold watch.  He puts lots in the edges of the frame like the board games Operation and Life while Mia is about to get her adrenline shot.  He integrates subliminal messages into his scene which take repeat and careful viewings to extract.  Pulp has so much, both on the surface and within; much more than Hollywood is used to.When you watch Pulp Fiction, try to remove yourself from those who feel they have to love it because everyone else does.  Love it for what it really has and for what you can really see and feel.  Watch Pulp Fiction over and over, and with each viewing look for something new and you will find it.

Love it for what it really has and for what you can really see and feel.  Watch Pulp Fiction over and over, and with each viewing look for something new and you will find it.  You will usually only find a film with any similar merit as Pulp Fiction in the realm of non-narrative, avant garde cinema.  But now that style has invaded Hollywood so take advantage of its genius and enter the world of fiction (but remember that nothing is as it seems, maybe even the title).

When I first saw this, my expectations were low, because people had said it was pretty bad. But I must say, it exceeded my expectations, and was a good, scary, and gory movie. Well-worth the watch, Wishmaster has become to me, a camp classic, and one of my favorites.The movie starts out about 3,000 years ago, and gives us a message on what Djinn's are. What is a Djinn? Read on and you will learn. In the opening sequence, an ancient king has wished to have the best party in history. Well the Djinn (Played devilishly good by Andrew Divoff) is best described as a smarta--, and the wishes he grants backfires on the people who are wishing it. In this case, all the people at the party come to gruesome deaths, some turn into lizards, another has his skeleton come completely out of his skin, and his skeleton walks around attacking people. Another has something coming out of his stomach, and one gets smacked against the wall. The wizard, comes in and tells the king to stop before he makes his last wish, which would make the Djinn be able to take over the world. The wizard takes the jewel (too which the Djinn lives) and commands he goes back in, he does, and stays there for 3,000 years.Then we see a statue, being delivered to a man named Raymond Beaumont (Robert Englund, best known as Freddy Kruegar). He has bought a new statue to put in his collection at his museum-house. While the statue is being lowered, the crane operator spills his coffee on the controls, and drops the statue on a man below, causing it to bust in pieces. One of the construction workers spots a jewel, and takes it out and puts it in his pocket.The man brings the jewel to a museum to which Alexander Amberson (Tammy Lauren) works. She investigates the jewel, and tries to find out how old the jewel itself is. She asks her friend Chris Lemmon (Nick Merrit), a jewel anologist to find out how old, and what kind of jewel it is. When he puts the jewel into the computer to be analyzed the laser hitting ther jewel causes the jewel to explode as well as the cpu, and injures Chris. The Djinn is now released, and asks Chris, if he wants the pain to go away, Chris wishes it away, and it does, but so does Chris's life. The Djinn is now free to find the one that released him to which that is Alexandra.He takes human form as Nathaniel Demerest, and goes out to ask people what they wish to do or not to do. And if they wish, they die. Say one wishes that his enemy would get cancer, and he grants his wish, and his enemy dies of cancer. A woman, wishes that she would have eternal beauty, and turns into a manequinn.The Djinn, who was released by Alexandra, makes her see all that he does. If he kills she sees, if they wish she sees, and has to live it all up. She has to proctect herself, as well as her sister from this evil Djinn, and try to make him not take over the world. Nathaniel, then goes to the party to which Raymond is at, and of course Raymond wishes to have a party that will go down in history, and he does (I won't spoil it). Alexandra must now, find out how to defeat this Wishmaster without dying herself, or her friends. Her final thought of defeating him is brilliant.As is the movie, I found myself entertained to the limit. I found no flaws, no gratitous gore, and no dumb story. Andrew Divoff who plays Wishmaster, and Nathaniel Demerest, does a brilliant performance, and a wicked one at that. And really gets into his performance, mixing with with terror. As does Tammy Lauren, she does a great job as her character, and gets realistically into it. Robert Englund (Who as always) plays his character well.As the movie itself? It had some great suspense sequences, most coming toward the end, and a really high count of graphic violence\/gore. But what got me the most, was how fun the movie was. It was never flawed, never boring, nor was it stupid. The make-up effects on Andrew Divoff, spectacular. And the gore effects, with people being ripped open, and one gets his mouth ripped off, this is definitely not for the squeamish. But, But, If you are a horror fan, who loves fun movies, this is one for you, believe me, I don't think you'll be let down.Just great!!A 10!! Rated R for strong horror violence and gore, and for language.

Another vision of artistic and technical achievement from Jim Henson, Labyrinth is a movie that remains with you for life.  To see it is to love it. While at first glance it may be branded a children's film, Labyrinth maintains complex story and artistic elements that children might miss.  While the story revolves around Sarah, played with innocence and strength by Jennifer Connelly, the true star is Jareth, the slightly sinister villain. As Jareth, David Bowie creates a villain who is at once charismatic and suave, but underneath like a child desperate for the attention of others.  He terrorizes her with trolls and chases her with Chillys, only to plead for her forfeiture to his will.  The film overflows its coffers with colorful characters to populate its world of wrong turns and wonderment (Many of these characters, and the same charming visuals return in two unreleased videos for Bowie's songs from the film, Underground and As The World Falls Down).  It also contains memorable and touching music from Bowie himself as well as composer Trevor Jones. Once you hear the somber As The World Falls Down or the jubilant Magic Dance, it will be very difficult to forget them. Overall, Labyrinth is a touching fable filled with colorful characters and memorable music, and not to be underrated or left on the video shelf.  For fans of the style, I recommend Frank Oz's Dark Crystal and Ridley Scott's Legend with Tom Cruise.

The film was not intended to be a documentary of sorts about what horrors that were inflicted in concentration camps. The movie is about love and making the ultimate sacrifice for that love.The game that Guido convinces his son about isn't intended to deceive the child. Though he was lying, he was doing it to protect his son's innocence at such a tender age. How else could you explain to a child, without absolutely traumatizing him, the horror and inhumanity of intense hatred? How would you tell a child that he will probably die simply because of his race? We have to see this movie through the eyes of a loving father who will not let hate rob he and his son of their inner joy, no matter what the circumstances are. In that respect they truly won by not letting their will be broken and their hopes be dashed.Many of the people who dislike Life is Beautiful laud Schindler's List because it is a more serious film. Yes, Schindler's List was an excellent film but its focus was mostly on the violence of the holocaust. Just because Roberto Benigni didn't show people getting shot in mass quantities every 15-20 minutes, for 3 hours, doesn't make it any less effective in relating the experiecnce of the camps. I was very disturbed by the murders and violence in Schindler's List but I was actually moved by it only a few times. Eventually the people became nameless casualties that just piled up. You didn't know their stories and you could only guess their feelings.To me, the main element that made Life is Beautiful so excellent is that it takes the focus off of the violence and gives us the emotions of the characters. I got to know Guido, Dora, and Joshua. I truly felt the emotions pouring out of their performances.Many if us have gotten so used to everything being shown to us and spelled out in films that we've started to leave our brains behind.

For example, we are supposed to believe that a man in his early thirties has been on film for his entire life 1. if he were born sometime in the sixties the technology simply would not be available to carry on with this charade. 2. and most importantly as bad as we are as human beings I cannot believe that any of you would allow this to happen to a person, therefore what is the point of this film? It doesn't make me think of anything other than Hollywood made a great deal of money off of us and we are starting to appreciate the sh** that they give us. So now that Stanley Kubrick has died where are we? The only thing that I can think of is that I am going to have to start making movies, I can't be any worse than these guys!!!

This time, he takes on the swinging 60's mod scene, as well as early James Bond.  Everyone knows the basic gimmick, freezing the shag-hero until 1997 so he can take on the evil Dr. Evil (also Myers).  The world has changed no free love, no more-mind freeing drugs.  Some people have talked about the picture as slapstick with a message.  The Austin Powers character must adapt to the drastic change and un-idealistic 90's.  The thing is, Austin Powers is not all that funny (except the rotting teeth and hilarious shagadelic dance). Dr. Evil is the one to watch.If you are not familiar with Mod, or any Bond movies, you may find yourself turning this flick off.  Most of the jokes are inside ones with these topics in mind.  However, the Dr. Evil character has you laughing all the way to the end.  It is truly funny seeing an arch-criminal going to family therapy with his son.  He tells the group his son is quite astute, and not easliy killed.  Evil steals the movie by partaking in every cliche the spy genre is comprised of and his cat, Mr. Bigglesworth, is the most important thing to him besides world domination.There are some great sight gags, especially when Austin and the beautiful Elizabeth Hurley strut around naked.  With careful choreography, their privates are never exposed.  Again, while Powers shags on, baby, you have to say this is Dr. Evil's film.  No doubt he and Mr. Bigglesworth will be back for the sequel, and perhaps his son has started that evil petting zoo.
