To watch a movie about a tragedy that really occurred can really affect you. That's what happened to me after watching this movie. The special effects are amazing, especially if you're watching it on a 55 inch TV with surround sound. While the movie takes you into the lives of those aboard the Andrea Gail and makes you like them, feel for them and their loved one's, it should be noted that the storm is a character in the movie as well. Considered one of the worst coastal hurricanes, it's frightening to watch, but so suspenseful, you can't help but to like it. Mother nature at it's worst. The director gives us a window into the lives of those men, whose lives were the sea who took them. George Clooney is perfect as the captain, Mark Wahlberg is fresh as one of his fisherman and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio smart in her role as well as George Clooney's female counterpart. Diane Lane's role as the girlfriend really makes you want to cry, you feel her loss, her aching, her undying love for her man. For that, Ms. Lane deserves mention. I've watched this movie (own the DVD) numerous times and it never ceases to move me. It's sad and not so predictable...unless you know of the movie or book, you might not expect the ending. That's part of what makes a good movie, to be able to keep you in suspense and wondering what's going to happen or expecting a happy ending and not getting it..I give it 8\/10, definitely worth getting the DVD for all the special features and true life stories.

I was quite surprised at how many people don't feel the same way I do.Some of the movies detractors seem to suggest the movie is a bit slow and that it misses opportunities for packing in lots of jokes. I can't agree, I think the pace is just right and that the movie's direction is more deftly handled than you might think. Some of the set ups in this film are developed meticulously over time allowing plenty of humorous moments along the way to the pay-off. And when they pay-off, they pay-off beautifully. For example I love the scene in which a German mercenary enters a really dangerous looking Mexican bar. The room is full of thugs and cut-throats who laugh at the German's prim appearance and so he kills a few of them. He then instructs the rest of the patrons to be more respectful of strangers and to expect some friends of his to drop in later. The mercenary leaves and soon the Three Amigos arrive wearing camp looking Mexican costumes. It's not long before they start to sing an extremely girly song to the patrons of the bar called My Little Buttercup. The song is accompanied by the most effeminate dance routine committed to film. The mystified bandits all assume the Three Amigos are the German mercenary's friends and go along with the song and dance routine which after a while becomes so cute it makes you feel physically sick.And here is the pay off, the Amigos leave as the real mercenaries arrive, one of the bandits notices the pearl handled revolvers one of the strangers is wearing and yells Look at the sissy guns. Carnage ensues, the German sharp shooters finish off the rest of the patrons in a bloody gun fight, the confused looks on the bandit's faces throughout this whole routine is hilarious.This film isn't desperate to pack gags into every available space, and because of this it feels more controlled and less try-hard, to me most of the jokes are of a high enough quality they don't need a lot of superfluous back up gags. I also enjoy the overall up beat tone of the film, even the bad guys are actually really nice to each other ( the sweater Scene is touching ). I think it's the warmth between the characters that really makes this film for me, I think if the gags kept coming at a breakneck speed we wouldn't have a chance to warm to the characters, the Mexican atmosphere and music the way that we do.

Pierce Brosnan plays James Bond, a debonair wisecracking secret agent. He's trying to destroy a group of renegade Cossacks who are out to destroy the electronic world by means of a satellite weapon called Goldeneye. Along the way he picks up a young Russian woman of flawless if conventional good looks. They go through various adventures, usually with Bond pulling the babe behind him. He has a car that's full of high-tech tricks, and ditto for his watch and his pen and his belt. Action. (Lot's of action here.) A satellite receiver dish is demolished while the girl, Scoripco, runs toward the camera in slow motion and then dives headlong over it, with the fireball exploding behind her. Later, she and Brosnan get to do the same thing -- together. There are fist fights in small cast-iron rooms where people are pummeled and smashed against the metal without even a bloody nose. Foreheads are used as weapons against other foreheads, and to hell with Newton. A man survives a fall of several hundred feet, only in order to look up and see a cascade of junk metal falling on him. Expensive special effects. A car chase through the crowded streets of St. Petersberg. Well -- a car and tank chase, anyway. A collision between a hurtling armored locomotive already in flames and the implacable tank. An exploding helicopter. A light plane shot with a missile crash landing in the water and skidding ashore in a complete wreck -- which both passengers survive. The crack of fist against jaw. The thump of heel against face. Bond, armed only with his Walther P38 pistol, is chased through a warehouse by a hundred cossacks, all of them firing at him.He is not hit. Every time he fires a shot, a cossack falls. (I keep saying cossacks but we all know whom we're talking about here. And if you still don't get it, the Cuban army is thrown in later on.) A comic villain is frozen to comic death during an ecstatic display of the sort found among penguins during the mating season.

(A direct ripoff from the most famous exchange in Goldfinger.) Above all, the first Bond movies had Sean Connery with that cartoon handsomeness and built-in mockery of himself. Brosnan isn't bad, but he seems to be enacting a role when he wisecracks. And although Scoripco is lovely, it was more engaging to see Britt Ekland, Ursula Andress, and Kim Basinger running around in skimpy clothes.Still, the movie is thought provoking.

The situations and set-pieces are wilder, the odds even bigger and character arcs more complex.Set 10 years after the first movie Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz have made a rich living out of plundering tombs and pyramids. Who could have predicted that their old nemesis I'm-Ho-Tep would return faster and stronger than before.But I'm still having trouble seeing I'm-Ho-Tep as a villain. Surely it's the scheming, lying, conspiring supplicants that are the real villains. The look in his eyes at the end, when his lover betrays him, is heartbreaking. I can't root for him as a bad guy when he never really does anything bad.

I only have one question; are you people blind, deaf or just dumb? Jet Li is the least talented martial artist there is... Bruce Lee would not only kick his weak little ass, but make him cry for his mommy too. Li has no charisma, no acting talent... for Christ's sake; he can't even do a martial arts movie without wires! Do you know why the martial arts of The Matrix were so damn impressive? If you look past the fact that it's well-choreographed, cool, stylish and well-filmed, it was so damn impressive because these people had no prior experience with martial arts fighting. None whatsoever. They trained for several months during preproduction, just to learn the moves. A few months... how long has Li been doing martial arts again? The better part of his life? Then how come it looks like he's dancing instead of fighting? He sleepwalks through every single fight sequence, and the super-slow-motion sequences look awful. They look entirely fake, like he's barely even moving at all. A lot of the action is ripping off The Matrix(I know that's almost a cliché by now, but seriously... dodging bullets by bending the upper body? Moving extremely fast in slow-motion, dodging bullets and getting the enemies weapons and using there own weapons against them? Please. It couldn't possibly have been more obvious). The plot is ludicrous. It's basically a ripoff of Highlander, by the way. The pacing is bad. The film utilizes every single Hollywood cliché and stereotype there is. The acting is bad and the characters are poorly written. The film is just horribly bad, tries way too hard to be cool without actually doing anything worthwhile, or showing us anything we haven't seen hundreds of times before, most of it being better. This movie represents the basis of what is wrong with Hollywood; you can throw a cheap script together from old ideas, pick an entirely unlikeable lead actor, throw some half-ass martial arts fighting into the film, fill it with some lame special effects, and still have an audience, despite cutting so many corners that your film should, by all means, be forgotten and all copies burned. James Wong, wise up, return to making great horror movies like Final Destination and stay away from Jet Li and his crappy movies. I recommend this exclusively to Li fans, and I advise anyone else to stay far, far away.

I thought it was for the kids instead, entertaining them into the special effects and saber duels, which also goes for the Episode II release, and the only thing that excited me was Yoda's duel with Count Dooku. I admit, I was a kid when I saw Episode I and finally a teen at Episode II and was awed by it also, but I also reverred back to the original trilogy once I have gotten a hold of DVD release(thank god) and I just couldn't take it anymore. It pained me to know that Episodes I and II are terrible renditions of the much anticipated story of the transformation of Anakin into Darth Vader, and forced me to question whether George Lucas had really thought this story out correctly or was he just too terrible a director. I understand that the originals were ground-breaking masterpieces that demanded audiences' surrender to its powerful prowess in story and effects, and I understand now that with all this digital tech, the awe-capturing effects aren't possible. But that shouldn't excuse Lucas from creating a powerful story. Yes, in Episode II, it had a little more depth than Episode I, but the actors killed the effect. Hayden Christensen doesn't belong to the role of Anakin.....AT ALL. Natalie Portman so far, hasn't shown any true on-screen assurance of why she fell in love with Anakin in the first place. And yes, Jar Jar Binks had absolutely NO part in the story and is not significant at all, let alone his annoying accent. The special effects were overused and a bit choppy in comparison to other films.

However, in spite of this dating, Escape From New York seems to get more relevant with age, especially in this day of constant terror alerts. The entire film gives one a sense of future-shock that seems to get more intense with every viewing.Kurt Russell was an excellent choice for Snake Plissken. He doesn't look like your stereotypical action hero, which heightens the feeling of the everyday man being hounded and persecuted for exercising certain freedoms he used to take for granted. The whole concept of a United States police force is indeed a frightening one, especially given the world's current atmosphere of one militaristic nation deciding to police the entire world.The entire film screams its low budget from the get go. The composite shot of the glider falling from the World Trade Centre looks so fake that it elicits howls of laughter, and the cassette players make it obvious that the filmmakers couldn't afford to use props that were less dated. I believe I actually stopped using cassette tapes for any purpose around the year that the film is supposedly set in. The doomsday supposition that crime rates will only continue to rise as time goes on also comes off as somewhat comical after the last ten years.As in almost any Carpenter film, the music hits a spectacular high note. Although it sounds a lot like the soundtrack for one of the video games on the Commodore 64, it works because it sets exactly the right mood. The collective beeps of the synthesiser, along with the thudding bass drum and the click of what sounds like a really padded cymbal, give the opening and closing themes a resonance that makes them memorable independent of the film.This is one of Donald Pleasance's more memorable roles, and he plays it absolutely straight-faced, with not a hint of guile. In fact, the serious attitude of the entire production makes it difficult to discern whether the film was actually meant to be a satire. It wasn't advertised as anything other than an action film in the 1980s. However, one can't help but wonder if the scenes where we see that the New Yorkers can rig a car to run on steam, but can't get the lights to work, represent what John Carpenter thinks of the titular city's people.I gave Escape From New York a ten out of ten. It makes me grateful for formats like DVD-Video, as it is a relic of the days when it took some creativity to make a film, and deserves to be preserved.

At the dawn of TV they were still working out exactly what to do on screen, and this 1st Disney show was a get-together. The sponsor, Coca-Cola was served at the party in its old 8 oz bottles while the narrator blabbed about how refreshing it was. Actually that's not so bad as the barrage of disjointed sound bites commercial TV has now (and why I watch very little of it). Also included are trailers, a making of, some kiddie stuff, etc.. Overall a nice package and it rates a 9\/10.

Of all the Bond films, these particular three are the most outrageous and it's for that reason why they're not among my favourites. For this review, I'll focus on Moonraker, a film that, despite it's positives, is still mostly a failure.The best part of the whole movie is the beginning the pre-credits sequence features Bond (Roger Moore, in his fourth appearance) being thrown out of a plane in midair and having to catch up to a villain who has the only parachute. It's a thrilling scene that's fantastically shot and is appropriately on numerous best-of lists. After the average song and titles, we're introduced to the main plot it turns out that a space shuttle on loan to Britain from the U.S. was skyjacked and Bond is sent to the shuttle's manufacturer in California, the Drax Corporation, on a diplomatic mission and to investigate the plant. He soon realizes that the company's founder, Hugo Drax (Michael Lonsdale) is up to more than meets the eye and that his refined demeanor is simply an act.There are two main problems with the movie it's similarity to the previous outing, The Spy Who Loved Me, and the sci-fi influence of Star Wars. On the former, I usually don't mind if a Bond film is similar to another; TSWLM is a rehash of You Only Live Twice, yet it's still one of my favourites. But two films in a row with the exact same plot (and in some cases, nearly identical scenes) shows laziness on the part of the producers. That brings me to my next complaint the space angle. Granted, the idea itself isn't too bad and it only takes up the final half hour. I only wish that Albert R. Broccoli had been a little more creative in developing the plot, instead of just repackaging TSWLM in outer space.This plot also demands that the crew create convincing special effects, but perhaps their aims were too ambitious because the movie failed to amaze me. While there are some innovative uses of models and they do look realistic, they don't jump out from the screen as they're meant to. Moonraker also contains the infamous laser gun, and those effects are downright horrible. In other words, there's no real 'wow' factor, which is a shame because, ironically, the cinematography is fantastic.It's the minor areas where Moonraker shines. The production design (from Bond veteran Ken Adam) is top notch, with Drax's estate and the space station interiors being highlights. The make-up effects\/costumes are suitably out-of-this-world, and even the sound effects are worthy of a mention. Plus, John Barry scores another beautifully haunting soundtrack that perfectly accompanies the wonderful locations featured in the movie from Venice to Rio de Janeiro to the Amazon. But the film struggles in more important matters namely, the script, the direction, and the cast.Returning to pen his second (and last) Bond screenplay is Christopher Wood, who definitely had more success with The Spy Who Loved Me. As I said before, Moonraker is an almost exact copy of the previous film and Wood's storyline is fairly uninspired; if anything, his strength comes in the dialogue, which is some of the wittiest and most quotable in the series (as well as the most tasteless). Consequently, Bond isn't given any real depth and only seems to be there to follow the by-the-numbers plot. Fortunately, while Roger Moore's performance isn't on par with his best, he still manages to keep the film afloat somewhat. Then there are his co-stars, who are less impressive.The love interest of the film is Dr. Holly Goodhead, played with little flair by Lois Chiles. Other than the name, the character isn't exactly the most memorable and the actress doesn't make it any better by delivering all of her lines in the same monotonous voice. As the villainous madman Drax, French actor Michael Lonsdale is a worthy opponent. While the character is a carbon copy of Karl Stromberg from TSWLM, the actor manages to not only look menacing in every frame, but the way that he says even the most banal of lines will leave the viewer in stitches. So it's fortunate that the film's best lines belong to Lonsdale.Unfortunately, one of the highlights of The Spy Who Loved Me, Jaws, returns and his involvement in Moonraker is anything but welcome. The once imposing villain is reduced to a bumbling oaf who is the punch line to numerous failed gags and who induces groans rather than fear. The secondary henchman, Chang, is forgettable and only serves as a minor irritation that is disposed of in an admittedly first-class fight scene. Finally, special note must be given to Bernard Lee, who played M in the first eleven films of the series. Moonraker would be the actor's final film (he passed away shortly before production started on For Your Eyes Only) and he gives the usual excellent performance.If I could blame one person for the movie's faults, it would probably be director Lewis Gilbert.

After viewing it the other day on a whim however, I was surprised at how much better I liked it now. The story centers around an evil mask-maker planning to use ancient technology to murder millions of children on Halloween night by selling them masks with a nasty little secret inside. I found the story very interesting, though plenty of plot holes ultimately keep this film from being all it could have been. The biggest obstacle in this film's way is the fact that it has nothing at all to do with the other Halloween films made either before or after it. That's certainly no reason not to give it a chance, though. Perhaps it should have been called only Season of the Witch or something so as not to anger the purists out there who demand the presence of Michael Myers in anything with the word Halloween in the title. That said, let's take a look at the good and not-so-good elements of this film, shall we?Like the previous entries in the series, this film has some creepy and effective music. It is also buffered by some evil synthesizer sounds at every turn. The little jingle set to London Bridge is annoying, and I'm sure it was supposed to be. There are some interesting deaths, to say the least. Early on, we see a robotic henchman pull apart a victim's skull, then blow himself up in a car. One hapless woman gets an energy beam projected through her face, leaving her mouth much larger than normal. (a bug then crawls out of her head, foreshadowing later events) Another man gets his head ripped completely off for threatening to torch the bad guy's factory. Later on, a family is murdered in a test demonstration of what happens when someone wearing one of these masks watches a certain commercial on TV. Bugs and poisonous snakes form inside the mask and attack anyone in the room. It seems the masks have some tiny pieces from one of the blocks from Stonehenge implanted in the factory seal. Something about the commercial triggers the effect within the mask. And just how does this happen, you ask? A good magician never explains, the mask-maker points out in one scene. Sigh.Some gigantic holes are present as the story unfolds. Tom Atkins, who plays our hero, has a useless love affair with the daughter of an early victim. If these two are so intent on solving a deadly mystery about the death of her father, and bad guys are all around, would they really stop to have sex? He is also much older than this woman. I guess since Atkins plays a doctor, the young woman finds that sexy. Maybe I'd better go to medical school if I want to score with hot young women when I'm his age. Another problem concerns the time that these masks are supposed to go off. We are told by the mask maker that when the commercial airs at 900 pm on Halloween night, all the masks will react and kill the children. However, if it's 900 in California (where this takes place) it would be 1100 where I live or midnight on the east coast. Children would mostly be in bed by then! Few parents would allow their kids up that late to watch any big give-a-way. The plan is to wipe out kids all over the country, but it looks like only kids on the west coast would be up when the commercial airs. If there was an explanation about how this problem would be overcome, I missed it. I guess once again, A good magician never explains.And just how in the hell did this guy steal a piece of Stonehenge, anyway? He admits it was difficult, but again offers no explanation of how it was done!And how many freaking times did the female robot attack Atkins at the end? I lost count. Well, it's not a total loss. It was a neat idea for a film, but they shouldn't have glossed over so many things. I'll give it 5 of 10 stars.

After viewing it the other day on a whim however, I was surprised at how much better I liked it now. The story centers around an evil mask-maker planning to use ancient technology to murder millions of children on Halloween night by selling them masks with a nasty little secret inside. I found the story very interesting, though plenty of plot holes ultimately keep this film from being all it could have been. The biggest obstacle in this film's way is the fact that it has nothing at all to do with the other Halloween films made either before or after it. That's certainly no reason not to give it a chance, though. Perhaps it should have been called only Season of the Witch or something so as not to anger the purists out there who demand the presence of Michael Myers in anything with the word Halloween in the title. That said, let's take a look at the good and not-so-good elements of this film, shall we?Like the previous entries in the series, this film has some creepy and effective music. It is also buffered by some evil synthesizer sounds at every turn. The little jingle set to London Bridge is annoying, and I'm sure it was supposed to be. There are some interesting deaths, to say the least. Early on, we see a robotic henchman pull apart a victim's skull, then blow himself up in a car. One hapless woman gets an energy beam projected through her face, leaving her mouth much larger than normal. (a bug then crawls out of her head, foreshadowing later events) Another man gets his head ripped completely off for threatening to torch the bad guy's factory. Later on, a family is murdered in a test demonstration of what happens when someone wearing one of these masks watches a certain commercial on TV. Bugs and poisonous snakes form inside the mask and attack anyone in the room. It seems the masks have some tiny pieces from one of the blocks from Stonehenge implanted in the factory seal. Something about the commercial triggers the effect within the mask. And just how does this happen, you ask? A good magician never explains, the mask-maker points out in one scene. Sigh.Some gigantic holes are present as the story unfolds. Tom Atkins, who plays our hero, has a useless love affair with the daughter of an early victim.

He was very definitely a patriot and one of the cornerstones of Irish freedom, but he was not the top player in the quest by virtually anyone's estimation; he was more of a soldier general than a political leader, like Washington rather than Jefferson, Franklin and Hamilton in American Revolutionary history. This movie could have been made with a number of other characters in the lead position who were more important and possibly more dramatic during that era. Patrick Pearse (a lawyer & patriot who had many quotes that could have been used) or James Connolly, who were both executed for the 1916 Easter Uprising, or even Eamonn De Valera, who although demonized in the movie had much more historic weight to draw upon --- all of these figures would have been my choices above Collins. I don't mean to disparage Collins' motives and means as I believe he was a fearless patriot to the end who got caught up in governmental and political machinations that he never should have been involved with; rather, he should have been an army leader, plain and simple.After seeing this, you quickly realize that the IRA has always been a bloody outfit of terrorists, but they have always had a passionate patriot quest that has fueled that bloodshed and their killing had a truly patriotic mission in its early stages --- their initial missions didn't include the bombing and killing of innocent victims, though they have always had trouble with choosing violence over political discourse. This movie gives the Old IRA as they are called by historians a patriotic and noble light, which is fair indeed. They would certainly not attain that position in any objective film about their latter-day exploits save the Hunger Strikes of 1981.There are inaccuracies in the movie as you will find in virtually any historically-based movie, but there is much more you will get out of watching it than just dismissing it as a Hollywood story. If you don't know much about Irish history, you will want to learn more after seeing it as I did my first time, and being of Irish-American lineage, I'm quite ashamed that I didn't know as much as I should have; in fact, I knew very little at all. This movie got me started, and after reading many interesting volumes of text from scholarly sources, archives & opinionated texts, I have formed some conclusions of my own. I believe that the real mistake was in sending Collins to negotiate with the Brits. Regardless of whether he wanted to go or not, he never should have been sent or accepted the position. Furthermore, he never should have accepted anything less than what the Irish leadership wanted him to accept, which was total freedom as a true, non-commonwealth Republic. There probably wouldn't have been a civil war and Collins would have possibly lived to be an old man otherwise and see the real Republic 28 years later. I do believe that the move to an Irish Free State was better than nothing at all, and I agree with Collins motives to gain peace and use Free Statehood as a stepping stone (even DeValera admitted as much later in his life), but there should have been discussion and debate and a general consensus among the Irish leadership with a bonafide plan to turn Ireland into a true free Republic within a certain, short period of time (like what Scotland recently experienced) before Collins & Arthur Griffith foolishly committed to it without that caveat. The only reason a majority accepted it was because it was a done deal and they didn't want any more bloodshed, and Collins and Griffith sold it to a majority of the public after-the-fact, most of whose citizenry was non-confrontational anyway. But with smart negotiating, they could have had it all in due time, the Irish Free State, then the Republic of Ireland (not to be confused with the Irish Republic which existed during the era of the movie prior to the Irish Free State) instead of having to wait until 1949 when England literally gave away its long-awaited freedom along with its other parcels of real estate, Israel & India --- Ireland never fought much again after Collins died. In retrospect, Collins was prophetic when he said that he signed his death warrant by signing the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1921.I believe Liam Neeson did a superb job as he always does. Aidan Quinn's accent grated on me (sounded like a New York Irish accent if even that) & Julia Roberts was just plain horrible and served as eye-candy only in my opinion and apparently most others. Alan Rickman also gave a fantastic performance as De Valera, and Stephen Rea always gives a top-notch performance. There are a few other actors I would have liked to see in this production, but all-in-all, I enjoyed the movie very much regardless of its shortcomings --- it was a very necessary movie to be made.I thought the music was excellent as well as the lush Irish countryside --- it will make you want to see it at least once in your lifetime.

A boy named Ali (Amir Farrokh Hashemian) loses his sister Zahra's ((Bahare Seddiqi) running shoes; Zahra threatens to tell their father (Mohammad Amir Naji). Petrified at his father's temper, Ali promises his sister that he will get his sister some new shoes as soon as possible. In the meantime, the two work out a tight shoe-switching schedule. The plot is inventive and provides some decent chuckles-good writing and comic timing. Hashemian is likable and relatable though he milks the babyish whimpering to an annoying extent. Naji is able to give us a stronger feeling that we are watching a real person on screen than any of the other actors in the film. It is not until the last ten minutes of the film, however, that we are swept up in a crazy whirlwind of emotion, jolting from despair to joy to suspense (though not in that order) and the last ten minutes can make a movie great. Majidi gives us homage to The Four Hundred Blows. The ending to Majidi's movie is somewhat similar to that of Francois Truffaut's; both movies contain the feeling of extreme desperation, but Ali has a goal in his life while Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Léaud) is boldly going nowhere. Truffaut's film concludes with brilliant ambiguity, leaving us wondering whether Doinel's last five minutes on screen were triumphant or pathetic; Majidi does something quite similar (less ambitiously) in a way I would not dream of revealing.

Naji is able to give us a stronger feeling that we are watching a real person on screen than any of the other actors in the film. It is not until the last ten minutes of the film, however, that we are swept up in a crazy whirlwind of emotion, jolting from despair to joy to suspense (though not in that order) and the last ten minutes can make a movie great. Majidi gives us homage to The Four Hundred Blows. The ending to Majidi's movie is somewhat similar to that of Francois Truffaut's; both movies contain the feeling of extreme desperation, but Ali has a goal in his life while Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Léaud) is boldly going nowhere. Truffaut's film concludes with brilliant ambiguity, leaving us wondering whether Doinel's last five minutes on screen were triumphant or pathetic; Majidi does something quite similar (less ambitiously) in a way I would not dream of revealing.

(Note Films that have a universal appeal aren't necessarily better than films that only appeal to people from one or two countries, but making a film with a universal appeal is no easy task.) A boy named Ali (Amir Farrokh Hashemian) loses his sister Zahra's ((Bahare Seddiqi) running shoes; Zahra threatens to tell their father (Mohammad Amir Naji). Petrified at his father's temper, Ali promises his sister that he will get his sister some new shoes as soon as possible. In the meantime, the two work out a tight shoe-switching schedule.
