I expected this to be a wacky, weird film when first seeing it. However, all the jokes fall flat because the premise is underdeveloped, most of the characters (most especially the title character) are half-baked, and the story is full of plot holes and developments that merit further explanation.Brendan Fraser plays Stu Miley, a cartoonist who creates an adult cartoon show called Monkeybone. In the beginning of the film, you see part of an episode that is well-animated (probably using Flash) about a manic monkey who pops out of nowhere and causes mischief. The reason this cartoon differentiates from other manic cartoon characters like Roger Rabbit or Woody Woodpecker is because he appears when the boy in the cartoon has an erection. Long story.It is with this cartoon that you get a sampling for what Monkeybone is like, but it's not enough to tell you what makes him so unique and appealing compared to other cartoon characters. More on that later. It is soon determined that the series has been picked up by a Comedy Central-like cable network (referred to as The Comedy Channel in this movie. Comedy Central could have put their brand on this movie, but it's a good thing they decided not to).Although Stu doesn't initially like the merchandising that takes place for his cartoon creation, he still takes some samples home with him. However, he gets into a car accident after complications with a giant Monkeybone balloon blowing up in his car. Again, long story.This car crash knocks him unconscious, even though we don't see him get knocked out by the crash. Although the wound mark on his head doesn't look serious, he slips into a coma, and into another world that seems to be a combination of Cool World (1992) and Beetlejuice (1988). This world is filled with strange creatures, some human and some animal. Sooner or later, he runs into a CGI-animated version of his creation, voiced by John Turturro.As soon as Stu falls into this world, the movie gets really confusing. It is not determined or said what this world is and why it is the way it is. Is it Stu's subconscious, or another dimension altogether? Obviously he came up with Monkeybone, but did he create the other characters in his mind, like the Egypsian cat lady waitress (Rose McGowan)? None of this is ever answered or explained by anyone in the movie. Brendan Fraser, who is normally a good actor, doesn't seem to wonder about this world he's in long enough. He may have been wondering during the film how his agent had convinced him to sign onto such a fractured movie.Regardless, in the conscious world, his girlfriend (Bridget Fonda) tries to get him out of a coma, while his sister (Megan Mullally) seems all too eager to pull the plug on him. There is nothing funny about Mullally in her role. It's never established exactly why she wants her brother off of life support. She doesn't seem to hate her brother, nor does she ever mention her share of Monkeybone royalties. Such subplots could have made for interesting conflict, but because neither of these things are explained, we just have a sad case of a woman who, despite being very funny on Will and Grace, has made bad decisions in regards to movie roles.Back in the subconscious cluster-flub of a world, Stu must get an Exit Pass from Death (Whoopi Goldberg) in order to regain consciousness. His annoying monkey alter ego works with him to cheat death, then ends up taking the pass himself and taking over Stu's conscious mind when he awakens from a coma. What results is Brendan Fraser acting like a monkey, only he's really bad at it. It would have been funny if the filmmakers dubbed Turturro's high-pitched voice into Fraser's speech. Also, Fraser seems to forget he's a monkey most of the time, only occasionally swinging on limbs and doing other acrobatic tricks associated with the main character.The big thing that makes Fraser unfunny from being taken over by his cartoon counterpart is the fact that we still really don't know that monkey. What are his motivations? What can't he live without? Why is his mission to give people bad dreams (another subplot brought about, but not fully explained), and what does he gain from this mission being accomplished? We don't get any of that. Instead, Fraser has a cringe-worthy scene where he, possessed by Monkeybone, publicly proposes to Fonda and then sings Brick House. Again, why? Explain, movie, EXPLAIN!!!I like Brendan Fraser a lot, which is why it kills me that this movie was so bad. What's even more disappointing is that the film is directed by Henry Selick, director of The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) and Coraline (2009). Those movies told great stories, and the stop motion animation was flawless. Mostly, though, the movies would not have worked without a coherent story line.My guess is that this film suffered from what's known as Groupthink. Groupthink is when a group of intelligent people get together and collectively make a bad decision, resulting from one or more people being too afraid to speak up and say the decision is bad, or convincing themselves the decision is good. It is what is believed to have caused the Bay of Pigs fiasco in the early '60's, and the tragic Challenger shuttle launch in 1986. Clearly, intelligent, talented filmmakers worked on this film. Unfortunately, someone should have spoken up and said what a mess they were creating.

I don't mean tragicomedy, exactly, the Shakespeare stuff, but just a movie about something big and yet the characters are a little silly. We can identify with them as they go to save the world.I think that's the idea in Foreign Correspondent, the closest Hitchcock movie to this one in flavor, and made two years before this one as WWII was breaking out. It was a call to arms, and Saboteur is a perfect continuation, firmly on American soil, of the fight to win the war by some very ordinary people. But for me, Saboteur doesn't quite get past some of the slightly goofy or awkward moments, though I'll bet Hitchcock noticed and left things the way they were quite on purpose. He rarely wanted high levels of realism, at least not unbroken, and our leads here, mainly Robert Cummings as Barry Kane, factory worker, get away with little cinematic things, like hiding behind a rock and not being seen by someone standing right there. This is something to get used to in almost every Hitchcock movie. It's a little like someone is sitting and telling the story and you are picturing it, so you get the basic idea right but not all the logistics. Another early example is falling down and seeing the letters on the floor. No one acts with physical realism, but we get the information we need to continue. The astonishing last scenes (I won't say where or what) are more artifice as theater as cinema. It's great, but it's beautifully artificial.Kane, the character, is a disarmingly nice fellow, and he's the innocent man accused to wrong, a perennial theme for the director. He is both fleeing and chasing. He meets unreasonably helpful good people and surprisingly incompetent bad ones. But he represents our wanting to be helping and running and succeeding, too, in the war effort, which was becoming all consuming for the nation. It's all done with reserve and a touch of humor, but underneath it is a deadly seriousness. Hitch knew his audience wanted to be rallied, so he rallied them.The thing that made Foreign Correspondent a bit better at this style is a better cast, and some funnier lines. But Saboteur is no slouch--it's well made with precision as it careens through incident after incident, and it has two scenes near the end that are legendary (the one in the movie theater especially artful).

Director Tom Moore doesn't try to disguise the stage origins of the material but, because of his mundane, straightforward handling, the piece doesn't grip the viewer the way live actors on the stage can. It has also been handicapped by the casting, with Anne Bancroft and Sissy Spacek portraying mother and daughter. They're marvelous actresses--and both are fine in this movie--but I never felt they were related (Kathy Bates played the daughter on stage, but was probably too old to be cast alongside Bancroft).

The Italian title literally translates into English as 'Bicycle Thieves', because ladri is in plural. As such, the English title makes more sense than the American one, because the desperate protagonist becomes a bicycle thief himself.The story is set in Rome and the camera does a good job in showing the streets of that city and capturing the rest. And the fact that it is in black and white makes it deeper and gives it a more nostalgic feeling. Call it good cinematography.Something very curious (which would be impossible today) is that, instead of professional actors, they used people without experience in acting. Yet, they are brilliant in their roles, particularly Lamberto Maggiorani (the leading actor, who portrays Antonio Ricci) and Enzo Staiola (as his cute little son Bruno). They are so convincing and realistic in their performances. It's as if, more than portraying the characters, they BECAME them.It's an extremely simple movie in all ways cinematography, plot, etc. Not that there is anything wrong or bad about that, quite the contrary! It's a good movie.The film tells the story of Antonio Ricci, a poor man who needs a job urgently and actually finds one (hanging up posters), but with one condition he's gotta own a bicycle - which is necessary for the work. No bicycle, no job. Get it? So he buys one, but in order to buy it his wife is forced to pawn the sheets of their bed.The good news don't last. Just as he is starting his 1st day in the new job, his bicycle is robbed. He's forced to search for the bicycle with the help of Bruno and other people he knows, as the police doesn't help him at all. Of course that such task will be very difficult and, in fact, they spend hours trying to find it in Rome's streets.During the search, Ricci and Bruno spend time together and they even go to a restaurant where they eat a nice meal mozzarella bread. During the whole film, the connection between Bruno and his father is notorious, as Bruno often looks at him and helps him in the various circumstances.When Ricci finally encounters the thief and angrily demands him to give back what belongs to him, it's no use. No one but Bruno helps him in this situation. The bike doesn't appear, the thief's neighbors fiercely defend him, there ain't any witnesses and even the policeman isn't much of a help. He loses in the most humiliating and unfair way and the thief simply gets away with it.The climax of the story comes when, in a moment of despair (although not without some hesitation), Antonio steals one bicycle but is seen taking it and caught by angry men who mistreat him. Luckily, he is set free. The movie ends with father and son depressed, holding hands and crying. That is the most emotional part of the film. And that is undeniably one of the most poignant and dramatic endings in film history.The guy was simply out of luck. When his bicycle was taken, nobody saw and nobody even tried to stop the thief. When he was the one stealing one, he was ferociously chased and caught. Life is so ungrateful. Plus, it's not just some bicycle. His life and his family's too depend on that bicycle, as without it he can't have the job.In fact, this movie is a take on the situation of many italians who, after the World War II, were poor, unemployed, going through great difficulties to get a job and without perspectives of future. Just how many of us feel now.

The Bounty's mission was to procure breadfruit trees for transplanting to the West Indies as cheap food for slaves. Neither ship nor breadfruit reached the West Indies. Mutiny prevented it - mutiny against the abuse of harsh eighteenth century sea law. But this mutiny, famous in history and legend, helped bring about a new discipline, based upon mutual respect between officers and men, by which Britain's sea power is maintained as security for all who pass upon the seas.With the story providing little mystery, apart from the question of who (if any) among the stars will die, and a relatively brief interlude during which the seamen have sex, you watched Mutiny on the Bounty for the excellent production values and top male performances. Not surprisingly, it won Best Picture honors from both the Academy Awards and Film Daily voters. Editor Margaret Booth received one of the former's richly deserved eight nominations. Surprisingly, there were three Best Actor Oscar applicants - Charles Laughton (as William Bligh), Clark Gable (as Fletcher Christian), and Franchot Tone (as Roger Byam).This startling event, it's been claimed, resulted in the Academy Awards organization introducing its Best Supporting categories the following year.

He has made 3 flops in a row, Lady in the Water, The Happening and The Last Airbender. But after making The Sixth Sense he had the world as his feet, he was touted as a potential director for Harry Potter and he was allow to make his dream project, Unbreakable.David Dunn (Bruce Willis) is a Philadelphia security guy and when returning from a job interview was in a horrific train clash. He was the only survive and even more miraculous David was unharmed. David ends up being very confused by why he survived and added to mix is his dissolving marriage with Audrey (Robin Wright Penn) and strain relationship with his son Joseph (Spencer Treat Clark). A comic book collector Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), suffering from osteogenesis imperfecta (brittle bone disease) believes that David is a real life superhero and that comic-book as a visual median were originally based on real people and just manipulated over time. Elijah tires to convince David that there is something more to his life and try and become a real life superhero despite David's scepticism.As stated Shyamalan had a lot of good will behind him after The Sixth Sense, which allowed him to make this project. With Unbreakable he was able to create a good supernatural thriller in the real world; this is not your traditional superhero film. It was shot very much like The Sixth Sense, with Shyamalan skillful using a lot of single shots, long takes with the camera moving during the scene and adding to the intense, tight feeling of Unbreakable. It was dark, moody and slowly building up throughout the film. There are excellent scene like when Joseph points a gun at David to prove that he had supernatural powers. This is a film trying to set the idea of a real-life superhero, this is not like Spider-man where he gets new powers and practices and makes a costume or Batman where he has to train himself and have a range of gadgets or X-Men where the world is filled with people with powers. David has to slowly discovery the secret about himself and give himself a purpose in live. There was able a good amount of comic book reference and talk throughout the film and of course there is a lot of iconography in comic book art, but I think it's a bit of a stretch to think someone would believe that comic books are based on real people. Shyamalan only shows one fight scene but it was a well constructed scene, with the camera up in the corner of the room and just keeps it there. It was a well executed scene. The dialogue was strong and Unbreakable has a very interesting plot and idea. But there are some plot inconsistencies which affect the film, like how David starts to develop his instinct powers.Willis and Jackson have worked together before in Pulp Fiction (even though didn't have a scene together) and Die Hard with Vengeance, and again there have excellent chemistry. I personally believe that Willis is a very talented actor, the best out of all the action stars of his era and with Unbreakable he gives a very powerful performance. He play the role with real conviction and was real in his performance. Jackson is one of the coolest actors around and too was a good as Elijah, but there were the occasional moment of over acting, like when he shoots at a customer. But of course when Jackson is on form he is amazing. I can see that Shyamlan was trying to find another Haley Joel Osment when he cast Clark, but he was not quite as good as Osment was in the Sixth Sense. Wright Penn was also good throughout the film and show she is a talented actress as a woman trying to keep her marriage going.I love the idea of trying to make a more realistic superhero film and Shyamalan was able to a make a good thriller.

There's a serial killer stalking homosexual men in West Village, and a green patrol cop(Al Pacino)is persuaded by Captain Edelson(a gaunt looking Paul Sorvino)to go undercover to snuff him out. But, as cop Steve Burns, taking the identity of John Forbes, continues to remain in disguise he finds himself becoming affected which seems to derail his relationship with girlfriend Nancy(Karen Allen). You know, Friedkin questions Burns' sexual orientation right from the get-go when Edelson asks him bluntly if he had ever engaged in homosexual sex before..notice how a jarred Burns can't quite answer that question. I feel that he was always sexually confused which would explain the rather vacuous nature of Burns relationship with Nancy(There's a lot about me you don't know.). They seem to embrace with a relative coldness that isn't very convincing. Yet, as Burns remains undercover, all of a sudden, in one particular night, his sex with Nancy has a force and passion perhaps never surfaced before. After this, Burns' sex life with Nancy becomes stunted and eventually non existent. To say that CRUISING completely cast homosexual men in a negative light I think is wrong. Sure, we see Pacino visit bars where men, in leather and not much else, these manly men with mustaches, balding and hairy, some with muscles, real guys who might work on shipping docks and meat packing plants, embracing, kissing, fondling, and the way I saw it, it was a release of hormones. This was their refuge, the place where they could be themselves with other men just like them. Are all gays so free and liberated, in a public place, like this? I think not, but who's to say that there wasn't places like this at all in the 70's. Anyway, what really intrigued me was the method of casting different men as the killer, as to keep his identity a secret. Is it Richard Cox's Columbia music student? Yes, his Stuart Richards was ill in that his father's disapproval(of what is uncertain, but one thinks that it could be his sexual orientation)caused him to imagine he often talked with daddy even though he had been deceased ten years. Richards does have a knife he comes at Burns with(Burns also has a knife on his person which I would think should raise some eyebrows as well). But, he never admits to the crimes and later in the film, a young gay struggling playwright, Ted Bailey(Don Scardino; HE KNOWS YOU'RE ALONE)is found mutilated(Ted is a good friend of Burns' Forbes)so to say that the case is closed would be perhaps ill advised(notice the haunted look of Sorvino's face, as if he's acknowledging that his undercover cop might've been the culprit). I loved all these question marks. Could Burns have become so guilt-stricken with his own budding homosexual feelings that he eventually took over the reigns from another killer?

And, Nancy's finding the gay gear in a chair as Burns returns home from his undercover work, with the gold shield he so desired, trying on the hat, jacket, shades, certainly left a lasting impression with me(I was taken aback at how sexy she looks in such garb). I didn't think the movie was anti-gay, just representing a certain section of homosexual men letting their inhibitions go. Men picking up other men, to me, is no more shocking that men and women hooking up, or lesbians..it happens, whether or not this film's depiction is totally accurate, I don't think CRUISING ever meant to represent the entire gay male population. Joe Spinell's cop is particularly creepy, how he's an obvious cruiser who might also be a worthy suspect(he mentions having a family who left him for Florida, so dealing with latent homosexual feelings could just drive him to rage killings as well, I think).

Bruce Lee was told to stop teaching martial arts to other races and was challenged to a fight. However, he fought Wong Man Jak in his school.

On the set of The Big Boss, Bruce actually was challenged by an extra, but the fight was not as elaborate as in the film.Just one minor complaint, the only thing that I didn't like was how the film made Enter The Dragon look as such a minor part of his life.And here's a list of guest appearances you may spot Shannon Lee (Bruce Lee's daughter), Jerry Poteet (original Bruce Lee student.), Van Williams (actor who played the original Green Hornet).So I suggest you see this if you are a follower of Bruce Lee.

Goldfinger succeeds more as action comedy than pure suspense.James Bond (Sean Connery) is relaxing in Miami Beach when he encounters a mysterious card cheat named Auric Goldfinger (Gert Frobe). Bond figures out Goldfinger's game and turns the tables on him, making off with Goldfinger's gorgeous accomplice Jill (Shirley Eaton). But you don't mess with the man with the Midas touch and get away so easily.Ask either a Bond-movie lover or someone with no interest in the series what the best 007 film ever was, chances are good you'll get the same answer This one. One may call it by its title, and the other something like The one where Bond's going to get it in the crotch with the laser, but Goldfinger is widely seen as the gold standard.So I admit my non-complete embrace of Goldfinger with some regret. It's a fine entertainment, but for me the least of the first four Bond films; not as shocking as Dr. No, not as finely crafted as From Russia With Love, and not as engaging or exciting as Thunderball.But Goldfinger was the film that delivered the Bond formula in its purest form. An opening setpiece scene to get the blood going, a wildly dramatic theme song, an outrageous plot, a memorable sacrificial lamb, and most importantly, two of the best villains of the series, Goldfinger himself and his mute-but-merry cinderblock of an assistant, Oddjob (Harold Sakata), whose death-dealing bowler hat is an icon in itself.Most of all, it dares to be funny, not just after the action is over but while it is still going on. Our first image of Bond is of him in scuba gear with a seabird on his head. When first told the lead villain's name, Bond snorts Sounds like a French nail varnish. Asked by a naked woman why he wears a gun, Bond shrugs I have a slight inferiority complex.Director Guy Hamilton seems to prefer a less strait-laced Bond then predecessor Terence Young did, sacrificing believability for effect. His panache helps one overlook some major logic holes. When Bond is allowed to wander around Goldfinger's estate, wooing the apparently uninterested Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman), the repartee and the scenery makes the pure idiocy of Bond's situation easier to overlook. A scene where Goldfinger traps and slaughters a group of would-be allies gets by because it doesn't linger long enough for a viewer to ask why.Peter Hunt's editing is justly praised for the way it keeps the story moving. This is so especially at the end, where he introduces the concept of the Bond countdown clock, the only clock that seems to gain seconds back when the camera moves away from it. Ken Adam's sets, especially Fort Knox, are good-enough excuses for abusing the still-frame button. Ted Moore's visuals are rich and stylish, nicely straddling the artificiality of Cinemascope-style productions with the rawer tones of films just over the horizon.Connery is at times lost in the background of his own film, the price of a hyperactive script. He plays Bond way lighter than he did in Dr. No, a choice that not only makes sense for the script but for the series. Bond couldn't have been as lasting or penetrating a persona without his tongue firmly in cheek.This became the nub of the Bond formula 1. Plant tongue in cheek. 2. Get away with murder.

He was too busy bringing AI Artificial Intelligence to the screen. Joe Johnston, a more than capable director himself, stepped in delivered a decent timewaster, but failed to give us anything new and didn't even bother to attempt an epic.Above and beyond all things, what cripples Jurassic Park 3 the most is the brief running time. The film fades out at the 84-minute mark, which is just unacceptable. The previous films were epics and both clocked in at over 2 hours. Why on earth did Universal take their biggest franchise at the time and cut it down to this? It beggars belief. The film feels like a TV pilot more than it does a cinematic event.Strange since the budget was $30 million higher than Jurassic Park in 1993. But the effects have improved drastically in that 8 year gap. I was never too keen or impressed with the CGI in the first film. The dinosaurs just didn't look right, but if you dared to criticize the film at the time you would have been shouted down.A lot of story concepts came and went before they, unimaginatively, settled on a same again scenario with yet another extended chase on Isla Sorna. Some of the scenes are even recycled unused sequences that never made the final script edit in the first two. At least they brought back Sam Neill as Alan Grant and had a small role for Laura Dern. William H. Macy provides great support too. It's good to see him do action for a change. And the kid in this one is far, far, far less aggravating than those annoying brats in the original film.John Williams didn't return, instead leaving the scoring chore Don Davis who made an adequate, if hardly memorable, attempt. All the good stuff is Williams' themes from the other movies. And since he made a few themes for this one I will assume that any noteworthy cues within were actually Williams' contributions, and not Davis', who I have never really liked.The action IS brilliantly done though, and the Spinosaurus, the new villain is quite scary. But just as it builds up to a big showdown,the film just...stops. What were they thinking? There's no payoff, no defining money shot. It just ends! That is my biggest problem with JP3. The familiar plot, and the lack of originality are forgivable, but rolling the credits at 84 minutes is a joke.I still recommend it for the action, sound design and effects alone.

This makes sense to me. When in prison, Libby is informed by one of her 'ex lawyer' convict sisters that as she has already killed her husband, and been convicted, she can do whatever she likes to him and not be convicted. She takes this on face value, and sets off on a variety of montage scenes to show her gaining fitness so she can accomplish this very task. Up to this point the movie seems like its setting up for an interesting story line.This is were it all starts to fall apart. Libby is released on parole after serving 6 years in prison. 6 years for a murder sentence? Sometimes you just have to accept these things in films so i will. Following this she makes what is possibly the longest list of stupid decisions I've ever seen a character make, including breaching your parole to steal a document from a school, making it extremely obvious which document you stole to directly identify you, getting on what is the most ridiculous chase scene from the police I've ever witnessed, including a beach buggy flip scene for chasing a suspect on foot, driving a car which you are handcuffed into in the river, and selecting a cemetery as the scene for which you meet your husband who is out to kill you. After these ridiculous amount of breaches in all logic from the main character who is suspected to be the one 'in control', she than continues to flirt with her ex husband, demanding her child back. Wasn't the whole point of getting out to commit your revenge? As a final touch to an already ridiculous series of events, they are going to fake her death and indict him with it at the end as some form of threat? By this point in the movie i was just watching one ridiculous scene after another take place with no obvious common sense from any of the main characters. This movie on face value really does seem like one of those classic 80's mystery thrillers, and i must admit, despite the ridiculous plot i was entertained, and its worth seeing, once.
