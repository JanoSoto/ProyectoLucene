And maybe that's is the strangeness and at the same time the weakness of this great and exciting movie. It is superbly photographed, features splendid cinematography (the scene with the plane in the fields is simply amazing, still after first time seeing this movie in 2015). Acting is very solid but not very serious, you won't believe for a second that one of the characters were experiencing a real peril, it is more like acting in front of the camera, not beeing there sort of acting. While the story is intriguing at first, it becomes more or less intriguing by the end, and although i really enjoyed the last sequence on the monument, some acting in there weren't just that good or realistic. Overall, North by Northwest is a definitely a great movie, but more of its parts are great that the whole. It has great comedic moments, especially by Cary Grant. Eva Marie Saint is more powerful in dramatic scenes rather that in action scenes, she isn't convincing in those, she is dramatic actress, not an action heroines. Directing is solid here (by legendary Alfred Hitchcock!). North by Northwest is very enjoyable movie and i absolutely recommend it to anyone who likes these kind of movies, and while the individual scenes are almost brilliant, the movie as a whole isn't as brilliant as the sum of it's parts.

That is mainly because the acclaim it got from when it first came out does not really translate to present day, and so one would tend to get an impression and have expectations that the film is not going to match. It has been so many years and nowadays the vibe of the film is different. At the same time, it really is a good film and perhaps can be better appreciated not for being outrageous or frightening, but rather for some fine filmmaking and acting. In particular, loved the set for the female lead's apartment and the performance by the actress playing her was quite good. The film has many memorable bits and pieces, but the overall vibe is about half as intense as watching an accident involving two vehicles with the highest safety rating and everyone has on their seatbelts. This sounds like it is bad, but it is not. Like I said, it is hard to write a review for.

When I first saw this film, I saw it as nothing more than some fart jokes and a bunch of cursing, but now that I am seeing it again at an older age, I realize that it is actually brilliant satire of censorship and the MPAA.The film follows Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman as they see the new Terrence and Phillip movie. This causes them to become more vulgar and rowdy, and the rest plays out like an long South Park episode. I was always was a fan of South Park, and would watch it whenever it came on, and this film is made for South Park fans, so obviously I would enjoy it. The humor of the show is a very specific type of comedy, and doesn't stray from that, so people who do not like that comedy, don't like all of South Park, and people who like that comedy, love all of South Park. This is why in the Animated Musical HoF, everyone who participates either hates the movie, or loves it. You can pretty much separate the whole world into people who like South Park, and people who don't.Like Monty Python and the Holy Grail every single line of this film is a joke. There is no moments where they comedy is stopped. Even when they are trying to deliver a serious message, they always do it in a comedic way. The actual jokes are very funny, and are exactly what I expect from Trey Praker and Matt Stone, but I think that there are episodes of South Park that are more funny, and I wish that they went all out for the movie. Because instead of watching this movie, I would just recommend you to watch the 4 best episodes of the show back to back, it would be more funny. This isn't really a huge problem, and it didn't lose the film many points, but I think you should only turn a TV show into a movie, you have to do something you can't do on TV.

A while ago I watched a documentary called This Film is Not Yet Rated it was a documentary about the MPAA, and how they constantly like to screw over filmmakers. Violence and blood barley bother them, while cursing and sex make them give films the dreaded NC-17 rating. There are many cleverly hidden lines about the MPAA in this film, and I imagine must have been hard to get past them. There were lines in the film were they said that violence is fine for children, but how dare they say certain words. Isn't sticks and stones may break my bones what we teach children? One of my favorite things about South Park is that it is always the children that realize when something is bad instead of the adults. I now see this movie as an argument against censorship, and I think that it is much smarter than many people give it credit for.I have now tried to explain why South Park Bigger, Longer, and Uncut is pretty brilliant. In my opinion, the whole movie was an analogy for censorship, and they threw a Saddam and Satan love affair in there just for fun.

I had it on a horror movie collection so I decided to give it a shot as I felt like watching a horror film. Suffice to say, it was not that good of a film, but I thought it would be worse. I actually like this one more than H2O; however, that is not saying much as I absolutely hated that one. Here they were trying something different, but in the end thanks to last minute changes the third act is very much an incomprehensible mess. I have seen some of what was going to be the ending and it manages to explain things better as far as what the deal was with the cult and baby, but it too, was no masterpiece as it did some very strange things too. This was Donald Pleasence's last role, and seeing him in this one you can tell he was not going to be around much longer. He apparently liked what they were planning to do with this film, but apparently a lot of changes were made on the fly which resulted in a big train wreck at the end.The story tries to explain Michael's killing tendencies...which is probably mistake one. Never try to explain things in a horror film as you take away from the mystique of premise and at worse makes the killer seem less threatening. Well, the girl from the previous films has had a child and a strange cult is after said baby and they may or may not use Michael to get said child or he could be acting on his own as the ending I saw has him going into super kill mode killing everyone. Apparently, the boy from the first one is all grown up and sort of crazy now and he thinks he has figured out why Michael does what he does, while Loomis enjoying retirement comes out to hunt Michael again, while a family has arguments about the daughter coming to live with her parents and attending college and the mom is the same one from the film Better Off Dead. A lot of subplots going on here! So the film did have an alternate ending, which focused more on the cult than Michael at the end. I think Michael literally stops in that one using the thorn symbol. It may not have been the mess this ending was, but from what I have heard the character of Winn passed the responsibility to being Michael's keeper onto Dr. Loomis. This is insane as why would a man who is younger make the older and much more feeble man his successor? That was just insane! The ending we do get though just has Michael randomly begin killing all the cult and you do not even get an explanation as to what they were exactly doing and the ending looks incomplete, almost as if it were a deleted scene or something.So, this film was not good, but it held my interest. I liked that they tried something different and while bad as least it was not H2O suck. That film is an hour of hand falling on shoulder, music cue and then a Don't do that! as it is revealed said hand did not belong to Myers, but some dopey friend. There were some good kills in this one and this one had more of a Halloween feel to it than did the previous two films. Those two looked as if someone half halfheartedly draped a few Halloween decorations here and there. The cast is interesting featuring a very tired Donald Pleasence and a lot of people whose acting is like cardboard or over actors chewing the scenery. The lead girl was also one of the most unattractive girls I have ever seen in a film of this type. She looked anorexic and from what I read the producers thought as much too. She almost looked like she were on crack or heroin. So, another Halloween film down leaving only Resurrection as a Halloween I have not seen. Do not want to either as that is a continuation of the H2O time line and I fear that one may be the worst one to me in the series!

Some physical episode maybe but Pee-Wee loves his dog and his bike more than anything and anyone else. Love is mental not physical like they pretend in Hollywood. The film then is some good exercise of a rookie director who is learning his job and tries to make teenagers and children laugh. A dinosaur in your cup of tea is always funny and a few snakes in your hands will make any infant laugh like hell. Or be frightened to high heavens.Some will say we have all the magic of Tim Burton in this old film. I don't think so. Tim Burton's art is not in this twisted absurd story but in the spirituality he will often reach beyond the surface of things. And here the spirituality is rather light and the surface is rarely pushed aside to get something more empathetic and sweetly cultural.The only moment I see something deeper is when he makes fun of Hollywood. That is both deserved and justified. Hollywood has to put some flesh on this absurd skeleton of a story and that flesh is a couple of kiss, a lascivious girl friend and some hot steam we can imagine in the background, though we know better and the pee-wee actor and his girl friend actress are only making out for the screen and in real life they may hate each other, the man may prefer men and the woman may prefer women. Make believe and nothing else. But the real Pee Wee is just the same. Make believe and nothing else. Well, I guess the first steps of Tim Burton were not yet very brilliant as for the mental side of things. I guess he could not go lower and he was bound to improve. See you in the next episode.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU ","genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family"},{"date":"28 September 2015","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" This debut feature is a gripping and engaging courtroom drama which is very effective. After I watched it once, I wanted to watch it again.A boy is accused of murdering his father. The twelve jurors retire to the jury room to determine whether he's innocent or guilty. Only 1 of them thinks he's not guilty and he has to persuade the other men why he thinks so.I personally found this to be extremely amazing. The movie was able to keep my attention for the whole way through. It was interesting seeing the men say counter arguments back and forth. Also, 1 of the jurors appears to be a sadist who just wants the boy to be put to death regardless of what evidence he's presented with. In my opinion, he is the best character in the movie because his acting performance makes him a very convincing character.Speaking of the acting, it was strong on all parts. As I said, Juror #3 (Lee J. Cobb) gave the best performance in the movie. However, there are several more actors who did a great job as well. Jurors #8 (Henry Fonda) and #9 (Joseph Sweeney) gave exceptional performances and the other 9 jurors gave convincing performances also. I don't think that they could've given a much better performance.Also, I found the movie to be very easy to follow. It gives a brief explanation of its plot at the beginning so everyone knows what's going on right before the 12 jurors meet. Also, the movie was very well-written. The fictional murder case set up was well and it contained a lot of elaborate plot points to it which were brought up during the movie.I can see why this movie has gotten as much praise as it has now. It is one of the most engaging and tense movies I've ever seen. The tension doesn't really come from action like many other movies do. The tension comes from the arguments brought up and how the jurors behave. I just watched this movie yesterday and I already want to watch it again. So far, this is one of my favorite movies of all time and it might even had the ability to become my #1 favorite. I'll just wait and see.

Each of these worlds is inhabited by androids who look, talk, and act like real people. You want to have a sword fight with a knight, you can. You want to shoot it out with a gunslinger, you can. You want to bang an attractive prostitute or wench, have right at it. But this fantasy world turns into a nightmare when the robots malfunction and start killing the tourists! Richard Benjamin does a great job as the unlikely hero, a newly-divorced and somewhat nerdy man brought to the park by his macho friend James Brolin. Dick Van Patten and Alan Oppenehimer are good in supporting roles. But it's Yul Brynner, as the black-clad gunfighter out to kill Benjamin, that steals the show with his commanding screen presence. The movie takes its time setting things up and building the suspense, showing one small malfunction at a time. It's an hour in before the killing starts. From that point on the pace never slows down and it becomes an exciting cat-and-mouse chase with Brynner hunting Benjamin. The sets and special effects are terrific, particularly when you consider this was made for $1.25 million (with half of that going to pay the cast and crew). I can't say enough good things about Fred Karlin's effective score. This was Crichton's first theatrical directorial effort (he directed a TV movie prior to this). I think it's his best work as a director, although I hold a special place in my heart for Runaway. His script is smart with nice bits of humor throughout. It's a great film that should appeal to a wide variety of people, so long as they are able to enjoy movies made before CGI. Sadly, there are many who can't.

I like films by Terry Gilliam as they always seem a bit left field and odd but strangely beautiful and 12 Monkeys is no exception. Gilliam has made a full feature length film based on Chris Marker's French short La Jetée, keeping the heart felt messages but also bringing in more Sci-Fi bonkers in a down beat, engaging and beautifully created 129 minutes. It studies the subjectivity of memories and their effect on perceptions of reality; it also looks at the way the interference of technology is creating a decline in modern civilisations communicating with each other. In La Jetée characters are haunted by visions of their own death, similarly James Cole (Bruce Willis' character in '12 Monkeys') has a constructed memory of his death which flashes onto screen as much as random monkeys do as the film plays out.In the distant future of 1996 (well, actually the past now in reality as I write this from 2015) a virus wipes out most of the world's population leaving only 1% of humanity hiding underground by 2035. James Cole (Bruce Die Hard Willis) is a convict who is volunteered to go back in time to 1996 to try and gather information about the man-made virus. All that is known are rumours that the Army of the Twelve Monkeys released it as a political statement to the world. Unfortunately the almost steam punk-esque era that Cole comes from things still go inevitably wrong with technology; instead of being sent to 1996 Cole is sent to 1990 where he is found, captured and eventually put into a lunatic asylum where he meets Jeffrey Goines (Brad Fight Club Pitt), the wealthy offspring of biological chemical engineer. Cole also meets Dr Kathryn Railly (Madeline Last of the Mohicans Stowe) who tries to help him to understand that his future 'visions' are all part of a psychosis. As events unfold James is taken\/sucked back to his own time\/reality to explain his findings but soon gets sent back to 1996 to continue, again meeting Railly and Goines. More events unfold and slowly Railly starts asking herself if what she has advised so far as a psychosis is actually real for Cole, she wonders if Cole is actually telling the truth. The film goes on and Cole, ever the detective, slowly works out who the Army of the Twelve Monkeys are and what their involvement actually was in bringing the population of humanity down by 5 billion people. Has he found out in time to do something about it or is he destined to fail forever more? I really don't want to spoil the ending too much as this is a masterpiece of 90's film and I can't recommend it highly enough, all I'll say is that while the ending answers a lot of questions it also creates some questions for the audience to mull over as they watch the end credits roll. Rather than concentrating on a glossy clean film Gilliam chooses to explore some of the dirtier aspects of events; time travel for example - it refreshing to see Cole suffering time travel fatigue and stress because of having to deal with different realities in different times. Contrary to what audiences have been taught of time travel in other films in Gilliam's film it's clunky and almost D-I-Y. Likewise the sanatorium that Cole finds himself in with Goines - rather than it being a structured and tidy institute Gilliam has portrayed it literally as a mad house where some of the inmates actually stand out as pivotal characters &#x96; miles apart from the stereotypical portrays Hollywood tends to put on institutions. Paul Buckmaster's musical score is haunting and creepy while not making itself too obscure and distant. The Peoples (David and Janet Peoples) behind the script have woven a memorising narrative which makes the audience as nauseous from time travel and staying attached to the narrative of the film as much as it does for Cole. There is a clever use of film reference within the movie which should jump out to all film fans and ties into the question of Cole's life and the question of whether he is trapped in a time loop paradox. There are virtual pats on the back and nod's to Alfred Hitchcock films, filming techniques and even his choice of casting (being practically recreated towards the end of the film). As mentioned Chris Marker's La Jetée gets a nod too in particularly when Cole and Railly are at the all-day theatre assessing their predicament. The Marx brothers get a virtual nod as does an episode of the Woody Woodpecker cartoon labelled Time Tunnel, even Dennis Potter's The Singing Detective gets a virtual nod from Gilliam in a film which has some small parallels to Blade Runner too. FTR - keep an ear open for Bruce Willis saying All I see are dead people - I forgot this line was in the film but watching it again years later this line made me laugh due to it's obvious parallel to the Sixth Sense DFor fear of going over the character limit I'll sign of by saying any good film fan should watch or have already watched this.
