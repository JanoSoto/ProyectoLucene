One of my friend's recommended me this movie, and I can only say that I was delighted by it. I consider myself an intensive poker player (Texas Hold'em), as I spent some of my nights in front of my computer playing non-stop poker on the internet(Pokerstars especially). Knowing the game really well, played a big role in my opinion about this movie. Movie which, i think, expresses very good the feelings you experience playing one your own. The ones who played poker before watching the movie, most probably found themselves in some of Mike's situations and choices. I also like that in the movie, poker is not considered a game of luck, but a game of patience and real skills.So, if you are a poker player, just watch it. You'll love it. It's like a story where it is explained in an original manner how Texas Hold'em Poker is played or should be played. Tells you about Luck, Why Play It, Winning, Losing and most important .. How to get back on your feet and star all over again.. with nothing, except high poker skills. Even if you lose, there is always another hand. If you're not a poker player... you'll be after you'll watch this movie. Trust me.

This is where they learn that the ship was sunken for a reason. One of the crew mutates into a horrific monster and starts killing everyone. Think Alien but under the sea and a little less believable. Notable Acting Almost everyone in this movie is good, that is except for it's main character. The head of the mining operation who is played by Peter Weller. Everyone else has their own personalities and you can tell who they are from it, expect for the only guy who will survive, he has the personality of a plank of wood. This is because the writers tried to make him out to be the sticking to the rules kind of guy. This doesn't make him seem like that kind of nerdy guy who turns hero, it just makes him seem like a boring to watch stick in the mud. This is the same guy who was the original Robocop. I did enjoy the Richard Crenna who played the Dr on the ship, he was one of my favourite character, mainly because he was so interesting and he was the only one who was actively interested in the sunken ship, granted that Peter's character is only a geologist. But even geologists have a curiosity for other things. Noticeable Camera work I sadly haven't noticed any good notable camera work, but this is odd because there actually was a cinematographer on the crew list for this movie, so there should be some decent angles and framing. But we did get a zoom in on the vodka being poured into the glass, this felt more like a nudge nudge wink wink type of shot to indicate that there is something wrong with it.Graphics This movie came out in the late 80's and had a standard budget, so you can tell CGI isn't going to be that much of a factor in this movie. We get what looks to be either an animatronic or CG spider which looks a bit fake, but doesn't stay on screen for long. Costume The costume for the Leviathan is pretty good as well, interesting design and looks pretty damn cool. Good to see that most of it was done using practical effects similar to how the original Alien was done. Incorrect Science The movie's monster is created by Russian genetic engineering. This is to allow Russian soldiers to adapt to a marine environment. This level of engineering is far past that of the movie, which for all points and purposes I will assume is 1989 also. That type of genetic engineering was impossible than and frankly is still impossible today. The scene which has one of the crew fixing a suit, until a spider jumps out. This wrong as that seemed to be a land only spider. All sea spiders have very thin limbs, no visible eyes and are generally one solid colour. Overall Feel Apart from being a shameless Alien ripoff, it is a good and enjoyable movie. Even if Alien is more believable. But regardless, this is a fun classic monster movie, if you enjoy monster movies when they were about story and not just how good the CGI is, this is a movie for you. The actual horror movie starts at 40 minutes in, the first 40 minutes are just used as character building to get you to know the crew who are going to be dying shortly.

The way comic book movies were meant to be seen, with respect and a surrendering belief to the comic book world. A belief is natural for real fans of the comic universe. X-Men is a realistic take on comic book heroes. The story of the X-Men is ultimately one of the best reasons to even film a movie in the first place of any kind. X-Men addresses major relevant societal issues entirely through, just as the original comics, in a simple to understand and positive way. Bryan Singer and company did wonderful work to create X-Men the movie. The actors and actresses are X-cellent! Hugh Jackman is the Wolverine, and nobody, that is, nobody could have done better. Hugh is feral and warmhearted as Logan. Patrick Stewart epitomizes Charles Xavier, Professor X. Patrick Stewart the mastermind. Ian McKellan is too, ideal as Magneto displaying a real understanding and connection to the character. Getting Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan for these roles is a perfect world come true. Halle Berry does a great job of acting support from the side and not becoming too much of the focal point in her portrayal as Storm. If I'm not noticing Halle then the movie really holds up, believe me. Anna Paquin is such a naturally very gifted actress and she fits the role of Rogue beautifully. Famke Janssen really personifies X-Men Jean Grey acting as one of the noticeably more interesting characters of the viewing. Rebecca Romijn is really the perfect Mystique and she certainly has the perfect body for Mystique. And if anybody ever needed an actor to play Cyclops, we could only hope James Mardsen was available. Marsden is very solid, very good. The other two stars, Ray Park and Tyler Mane, are as good as any playing as Toad and Sabretooth. X-Men has a smartly shown story developing sharply from scene to scene. Smart action with very good special effects. A great visual experience. It has an impressive score.

Timothy Dalton, who had long been considered a leading candidate for the role, was an inspired choice for the fourth 007. His intense acting style and the fact that he was known for playing brooding characters meant that his Bond was immediately set apart from his predecessor. Moore played Bond as a charming, witty, lovable rogue while Dalton plays him as a serious, dangerous secret agent who takes little pleasure in his work. He plays the role as if Bond found his work a little soul destroying and he comes across very well as a result. His Bond is probably the most realistic of the first four in that sense. Dalton is also very impressive in the action scenes and, as far as I could tell, he did virtually all of them himself. If I had one criticism of his performance, it would be that he lacks Connery and Moore's talents for delivering the requisite Bond quips but at least makes a good stab at it.My biggest criticism of the film is that the two main villains are a little low key. Both Jeroen Krabbé and Joe Don Baker are good actors but neither of them is served particularly well in this film. Much like Largo in Thunderball, General Koskov is a character who is very interesting in theory but less so in practice. He doesn't seem like the type of person who would rise to the rank of general in the Soviet Army and I find it hard to believe that his fawning, Uriah Heep-esque gestures of friendships would fool anyone. While he has far less screen time, Baker doesn't fare much better. He's certainly quite funny as Brad Whitaker but I'm sure that the character should be funny. I think that he was miscast, frankly. I felt that he were told that Whitaker was a dangerous megalomaniac rather than being shown it, which is never a good thing in drama. Conversely, Andreas Wisniewski is perfectly cast as Necros, one of the most intimidating Bond villains. Like many henchmen, he is mostly silent and that serves to make him all the more menacing. The scene in which he infiltrates MI6 dressed as a milkman and his fight with Bond inside and out of the cargo plane in Afghanistan are two of the most impressive action sequences to ever grace a Bond film, particularly the latter. Maryam d'Abo is likewise very well cast as Kara Milovy, a naive young woman but a highly intelligent, brave and resourceful one. She is extremely likable in the role and the scenes in Vienna are very sweet, even if Bond's motivations are less than pure. In stark contrast to Stacey Sutton in A View to a Kill, he is very capable in dangerous situations and proves to be a loyal and beneficial ally to Bond. There is a certain innocence in their relationship which I found very endearing. In his third appearance as M, Robert Brown is once again far too nice in the role. Taking on the daunting cast of succeeding Lois Maxwell after 14 films, Caroline Bliss makes a good impression as Miss Moneypenny and is likable in the role. Desmond Llewelyn, now the sole on screen survivor of the Sean Connery era, plays Q with his usual skill and wit. In his final Bond appearance, Walter Gotell was intended to play a much larger role as General Gogol than usual but his ill-health meant that Eon could not receive the necessary insurance cover and General Pushkin was created to replace him. John Rhys-Davies is excellent as Pushkin, playing the role with great charm and no small amount of humour. The fact that he and Bond are willing to trust each other is a nice reflection of the detente, as is the warm relationship between M and Gogol. Art Malik is very good as Kamran Shah, the Oxford- educated senior Mujahideen figure. He makes for a fascinating character as he is one of Bond's more unsavoury allies. The vast political changes in the world since 1987 make the film's depiction of the Soviet war in Afghanistan all the more interesting. As with Gotell, this was Geoffrey Keen's final Bond film and it's a shame that his tenure ends not with a bang but a whimper as he gets virtually nothing to do. It was nice to see Nadim Sawalha and Virginia Hey pop up but their roles were very small.The use of locations was as excellent as usual, particularly Vienna and Morocco. The action scenes were some of the best in years, particularly the aforementioned cargo plane fight. I did find it a bit hard to believe that Koskov could survive the impact between the jeep and the other plane practically unscathed though. However, it was rather disappointing that Koskov was killed off screen. The climax of the film was rather weak, I'm afraid, with the confrontation between Bond and Whitaker being the only uninspired action scene in the film. At least Whitaker got his just desserts though! This was John Barry's final score for the series and one of his best but I wasn't too enamoured with the use of electronic music or the title song. Overall, this is a very strong, exciting and well made Bond film with a great plot. I thought that it was the most serious and realistic film since On Her Majesty's Secret Service. The unfortunately rather short-lived Timothy Dalton era is off to a flying start. If the villains and the ending were stronger, I'd give it a perfect score. Finally, the film is notable as being the last in which the Cold War plays a role and the last until Casino Royale to take its title from an Ian Fleming story.

While he has far less screen time, Baker doesn't fare much better. He's certainly quite funny as Brad Whitaker but I'm sure that the character should be funny. I think that he was miscast, frankly. I felt that he were told that Whitaker was a dangerous megalomaniac rather than being shown it, which is never a good thing in drama. Conversely, Andreas Wisniewski is perfectly cast as Necros, one of the most intimidating Bond villains. Like many henchmen, he is mostly silent and that serves to make him all the more menacing. The scene in which he infiltrates MI6 dressed as a milkman and his fight with Bond inside and out of the cargo plane in Afghanistan are two of the most impressive action sequences to ever grace a Bond film, particularly the latter. Maryam d'Abo is likewise very well cast as Kara Milovy, a naive young woman but a highly intelligent, brave and resourceful one. She is extremely likable in the role and the scenes in Vienna are very sweet, even if Bond's motivations are less than pure. In stark contrast to Stacey Sutton in A View to a Kill, he is very capable in dangerous situations and proves to be a loyal and beneficial ally to Bond. There is a certain innocence in their relationship which I found very endearing. In his third appearance as M, Robert Brown is once again far too nice in the role. Taking on the daunting cast of succeeding Lois Maxwell after 14 films, Caroline Bliss makes a good impression as Miss Moneypenny and is likable in the role. Desmond Llewelyn, now the sole on screen survivor of the Sean Connery era, plays Q with his usual skill and wit. In his final Bond appearance, Walter Gotell was intended to play a much larger role as General Gogol than usual but his ill-health meant that Eon could not receive the necessary insurance cover and General Pushkin was created to replace him. John Rhys-Davies is excellent as Pushkin, playing the role with great charm and no small amount of humour. The fact that he and Bond are willing to trust each other is a nice reflection of the detente, as is the warm relationship between M and Gogol. Art Malik is very good as Kamran Shah, the Oxford- educated senior Mujahideen figure. He makes for a fascinating character as he is one of Bond's more unsavoury allies. The vast political changes in the world since 1987 make the film's depiction of the Soviet war in Afghanistan all the more interesting. As with Gotell, this was Geoffrey Keen's final Bond film and it's a shame that his tenure ends not with a bang but a whimper as he gets virtually nothing to do. It was nice to see Nadim Sawalha and Virginia Hey pop up but their roles were very small.The use of locations was as excellent as usual, particularly Vienna and Morocco. The action scenes were some of the best in years, particularly the aforementioned cargo plane fight. I did find it a bit hard to believe that Koskov could survive the impact between the jeep and the other plane practically unscathed though. However, it was rather disappointing that Koskov was killed off screen. The climax of the film was rather weak, I'm afraid, with the confrontation between Bond and Whitaker being the only uninspired action scene in the film. At least Whitaker got his just desserts though! This was John Barry's final score for the series and one of his best but I wasn't too enamoured with the use of electronic music or the title song. Overall, this is a very strong, exciting and well made Bond film with a great plot. I thought that it was the most serious and realistic film since On Her Majesty's Secret Service. The unfortunately rather short-lived Timothy Dalton era is off to a flying start. If the villains and the ending were stronger, I'd give it a perfect score. Finally, the film is notable as being the last in which the Cold War plays a role and the last until Casino Royale to take its title from an Ian Fleming story.

The storytelling is so much more mature, and the soundtrack by the great John Williams covers this with Darth Vader getting his iconic theme that has defined villains in cinema history, and launched him into the centre of what could possibly be the best villain Hollywood has ever seen.The grand epic premise of Episode IV which led to the destruction of the first death star had us all rooting for the Rebels, but surely the Empire would 'strike back' and as such the Rebels are quashed in amazing fashion that leads the audience enthralled and gaping for more. Following a special movie, that had re-defined technology in cinema it would be a daunting task to accede this, but again the technological advancements remained on pace with the cinematography and editing being exquisite. Another comparison with A New Hope is that of the storytelling which is nothing short of amazing. Laurence Kasdan did a brilliant job here, giving us not only a better story but a more gritty story whilst retaining some of that humour that defined the relationship of Luke, Han and Leia. On that note, the characters are masterfully executed with Han clearly stealing the show as well as the climax of the film presenting us Leia's and Han's newly found love which had been developing slowly over the course of the film. Leia, the strong woman that she is, is as good as she was in Episode IV, and Luke who was merely an amateur develops into a well rounded Jedi though his brashness and selflessness leads him to ignore Yoda's plea leading to his epic confrontation with Vader. A well choreographed duel to say the least, but Luke's apparent frustrations and inexperience leads to his own demise at the hands of Vader. What follows next is probably the greatest twist in cinema history. It didn't feel out of place or forced, it just seemed so well done, but that single confrontation and revelation is Star Wars. Luke- our hero - being the son of the embodiment of evil was such a shock, that the anticipation for the sequel was at an all time high. Overall, more questions were left than answered, though this can be a recipe for disaster, Star Wars Episode V did it in such a satisfying way that true Star Wars fans cannot downgrade it. A further testament to the quality of the film is the fact that the editing doesn't take anything away from the overall quality of the film, which maintains its powerful nature till this very day.

It's good that Duvall is now respected by the other astronauts because he is to be the pilot and captain of their mission. Duvall helms the mission with a steady hand. He says Roger that! and manages to calm down the obligatory squirrelly Russian. You'll have to watch for yourself, to see if the Messiah saves everyone...Don't attempt to guess the ending of Deep Impact from what is written above.

How to manage this with Doomsday around the corner becomes amusing. The silliest part of the story is the plot involving young Wood, the kid who discovered the comet. Told by a classmate, You're gonna have sex a lot more now than anyone else in your class! due to his fame, Wood takes giant step toward making that come true...Not only does Wood figure out a way to have safe (off-screen) sex, he can hop on his bicycle (and, later, motorcycle) and get anywhere he wants in under two minutes. Now, that's talent. Also, it doesn't matter where you are among millions of frantic people, all trying to travel on thousands of congested highways &#x96; Wood will find you. If there ever is a real Doomsday, your best route to safety would be to find and stick close to Elijah Wood. That being said, lucky Leelee Sobieski (as Sarah Hotchner) does well in her role.

The U.$. released 30 BILLION pounds of munitions in Vietnam (and by the early 70s, there were 20 million bomb craters) and 70 Million liters of herbal agents- most notably Agent orange (which Turse refers to rightly as ECOCIDE). This was the equivalent of 640 Hiroshima bombs... Detained civilians and captured guerrillas were often used as human mine detectors and regularly died in the process. The Biggest crime of all, called Operation Speedy Express, was, according to concerned soldier George Lewis, ... a My Lai each month for over a year. The International Commission of Enquiry Into U.$.

The idea of the trip is really that of the leader of the group, rugged outdoor macho man Lewis Medlock (Burt Reynolds). Along with him are married, meditative, pipe-smoking art dealer Ed Gentry (Jon Voight), family man and guitar-playing sales supervisor Drew Ballinger (Ronny Cox), and chubby bachelor insurance salesman Bobby (Ned Beatty). The last two are out of their element, and there is an eerie feeling all around. A major factor is the cultural clash and hostility of the mountain people; the film shows the effects of inbreeding among them. Sensing a perilous omen, Ed urges early on, Look, Lewis, let's go back to town and, ah . . . play golf. As it turned out, it would have been better for the four men had Lewis heeded Ed's advice.The Dueling Banjoes scene featuring Drew with the deformed albino youngster (Billy Redden), which occurs less than ten minutes into the film, is a classic. After that the first day of paddling is quiet and unassuming two men in each of two canoes. Later, on land, Ed takes aim at a deer with bow and arrow but misses. The problems begin on the following day (less than forty minutes into the movie), when Bobby and Ed canoe ahead and land, and soon are assaulted by two armed hillbillies. They have many missing teeth. Bobby is sodomized and only Lewis' timely arrival stops further damage. Lewis shoots one of the hillbillies (Bill McKinney) through the torso with a deft arrow; the other escapes (Herbert Cowboy Coward). The four men argue how the handle the tricky situation bury the hillbilly or notify the authorities. Lewis' idea wins out over Drew's after he claims that all of the locals are related, and a later trial will not be a fair one. So the corpse is buried. But disaster, in the form of nature, strikes again. When the men resume paddling they hit a stretch of rapids. Suddenly a shot is thought to ring out, spilling Drew into the drink. While Drew disappears below the waterline, the other men are dashed against the rocks. Lewis breaks his right leg as the men come to rest in a gorge against a cliff where a hillbilly armed with rifle waits above. Now Ed must become the leader of what's left as Lewis' role is minimal for the rest of the feature. Barely able to speak, Lewis urges Ed to climb the cliff to go after the hillbilly. With much difficulty Ed scales the cliff and dispatches the mountain man, but also wounds himself in the process. Upon closer examination it is not entirely clear that the second dead hillbilly was indeed the surviving perpetrator. Anyway, the latest corpse is tossed into the river. After recovering Drew's body, weighing it down, and sending it back under the waterline, the three survivors struggle to make it back to a local town (Aintry). They have to get their stories straight and then notify the local authorities. Their dilemma is a moral one. The visual effects of Deliverance are stunning, the acting superior, and the narrative gripping. The story is a disturbing one, in which the author of the book, ecology-minded James Dickey, sees a wild nature turning on a civilized but tactless man. Characters are developed, and we experience how each one reacts to his own personal situation.

The movie could have cut these scenes and it wouldn't have suffered.Clint Eastwoods performance is very... Clint Eastwood-ish. Lot's of staring and furrowed brows. It's really nothing special here. It works, but it doesn't give us anything too memorable. The other actors get the job done, but also don't really give us a lot to remember or love.Some people might enjoy this movie, and thats okay, but I personally wouldn't say it's an amazing western. Obviously fans of the genre would want to check it out, but other than that, it just doesn't leave you with a lasting impression aside from a few interesting scenes.

This film sees Batman attempting to stop businessman Max Shreck's attempts to make The Penguin the Mayor of Gotham also while interacting with another new Villain Catwoman. Now Michael Keaton reprises his role as Bruce Wayne\/Batman and once again he puts in a wonderful performance. Michelle Pfeifer is also fantastic as Catwoman she is a good mix of sexy and dangerous and really adds to the film. Now Danny DeVito was perfect for this Penguin and he is totally gross throughout the character really is disgusting which is what it was meant to be. Christopher Walken as Max Shreck was a great performance as the lesser villain in this film and he is truly the worse human possible. Now one negative like both the Burton's and Schumacher Batman films is the role of Commissioner Gordon his character is just a waste of space and not needed throughout any of these films and this upsets me after seeing what Christopher Nolan has done with the character. The story is nothing special either the motivations of both The Penguin and Catwoman aren't revealed till the very end and this really shows that the story wasn't a true priority apart from Shreck's story. The script was decent but nothing special and it doesn't really seem that it was a problem. The style of the film was truly a mixed bag though the style of the main characters and this Christmassy Gotham which is cool. But the Burton costumes created are rubbish and they really make it feel like a cartoon at times. The soundtrack is great and helps add the tension. This film is decent but with more mistakes then the first Batman.
