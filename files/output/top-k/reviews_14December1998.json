The greatest weaknesses are Queen Latifah's promising but undeveloped character (barely more than a prop for Hunter's Judith to lean on) and an ending which grants Hunter and DeVito the happiness they've been seeking, in a tidy little package.

I'll admit that you can get a little drowsy when watching it, probably because they sort of made the Enterprise interior a little too bland, and I have to admit the uniforms are like pajamas, and were rather pale looking compared to TOS uniforms.

Now I won't really trash the film for this, for it's only in the extended version You can see part of the set of the Enterprise's airlock when Kirk is drifting out, one of the worst bloopers seen in a Star Trek movie. But this was also the first time Trekkers got to see the Klingons as they were meant to be, with the head ridges. However, the Kirk we see in this movie is not the same Kirk we saw in the original episodes, he had more of a generic feel to him than usual. Chekov seems to have lost his Russian pride, although I admit he hasn't broken his tradition of being the noisiest character when he gets zapped by plasma energy and screams. And the intruder-probe scene on the bridge could have had a more energetic feel to it, with music to increase suspense, although Goldsmith did do a good job on the score.Rating C+ ","genre":null},{"date":"14 December 1998","score":"","review":"  I admit, this movie was too slow and too long, however, Star Trek The Motion Picture is the first time ever that you get to see Star Trek with spectacular special effects, and then a more modern, sleeker USS Enterprise.

The film has about a half a dozen stories running through it, most of them collide with one another at the Cotton Club, where extremely talented people put on shows, the mob takes care of business, and the wealthy can drink and laugh the night away.Just a few of the stories include Dixie Dawyer's (Richard Gere's) romance with mob girl (Diane Lane), a talented dancer's (Gregory Hines') relationship with club singer (Lonette McKee), and various member of the mob, including Bob Hoskins and Fred Gwynne.The movie looks and sounds wonderful!  The jazz music is great and the numbers are extravagant.  The film is very well directed by Francis Ford Coppola, who has a taste for style.  But, unfortunately, there are some problems.  Although there are many enjoyable vignettes, the whole film doesn't quiet gel together.Most of the performances are first-rate.  Gere is a particular standout as Dixie Dawyer.  The talented Hines and the beautiful McKee are also perfect and share many of the film's best scenes together.  Hoskins, Gwynne, and Nicholas Cage provide excellent support.  Diane Lane, however is rather flat as Gere's love interest.Despite its shortcomings, The Cotton Club remains a brilliant piece of work that will be liked by some more than others, but contains something for nearly everyone.

It's far beyond my comprehension how this film was so popular with filmgoers and critics. Although I think critics jumped on the band wagon over time in part due to its popularity as I think it was coolly received when initially released . Whatever the case may be its my personal candidate for most over rated film ever !  To start with I didn't find any of its lame dialogue witty or funny. I specially hated the initial scene with Redford and Ross  keep going teacher lady and Why can't you ever be on time  also the closing lines between Redford & Newman were also unfunny and corny. My recollection of the trailers for the film gave me the impression this was an action film and I consider it to be a contemporary of films of its time Bonnie & Clyde and The Wild Bunch. Those were truly great films while BCATSD was a pale imitation. The few action scenes in the film were too lightweight and the only memorable moment in the film for me was when Butch & Sundance kill  bandits during a period where they try to go straight and Sundance comments  well we've gone straight  When the film tried to get serious and hard edged the producers bailed out badly at the end. Our Hollywood pretty boys  were freeze framed at the conclusion instead of being graphically shot to pieces as was the norm for the time and had they the courage to film it that way it would have given the film some power. I'm sure they would tell you that it was not the intention of the film to go in that direction but this was to be a fun light film. Light yes fun perhaps to those amused by the dialogue but nothing else. I'm sure the Newman Redford combo and chemistry had more to do with the film's success than anything else. It was nicely photographed and had a good score but what is this movie about and what is it saying to us !? The Pinkerton pursuit was overlong and I think in part due to the lack of any real script.
