[{"date":"17 April 2011","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" W.B. Animation is one of the less-successful animated companies because most of their films were box-office bombs. But they did make three classics, the first one was, Batman Mask Of The Phantasm, the second one was, Cat's Don't Dance, and the third one was, The Iron Giant.The plot is just like, E.T., except instead of an alien, it's a giant robot from Outer Space voiced by Vin Diesel. What I love about this movie is that it has great animation, some funny moments, the voice acting was good, and the movie also has some nice references to the Cold War.There's nothing else to say about this film. But if you're looking for a good animated film to watch. The Iron Giant, is worth watching.
