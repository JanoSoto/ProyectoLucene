Then there are the sequels that do not improve upon the original, but are still good movies on their own. Then there is Aliens. A sequel that is not like other sequels. Aliens is one of those sequels that is either as good as or better than the original. The film continues Ripley's story arc at exactly where the first one left off. Ripley has been floating around in stasis for 57 years. When she returns home, her employer, the Weyland-Yutani Corporation, asks her what happened. Ripley tells them the entire story which none of them believe. She is also suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Ripley is told that there are now colonists on the planet LV-426 which is the crew she served with found the ship from the first film. Burke, a high level representative from the company, tells Ripley that communication with the colony has stopped and convinces her to return there with marines and be an adviser. Unfortunately when they get there, the colony is destroyed and the colonists are nowhere to be found except for one survivor, a little girl named Newt. They find out that the colonists did discover the ship and everything that happened on the Nostromo is now repeating itself in the colony. This sequel was directed by Terminator director James Cameron, not Ridley Scott. But it still does not matter as Aliens has a lot of what made the first film great. H.R. Giger's designs from the first film are improved upon. That goes more than double with one of the aliens late in the film. The marines in this movie are armed with state of the weapons that can easily kill, but the film keeps all of the tension by having them completely outnumbered and at a disadvantage with them not knowing what they are up against, despite Ripley telling them earlier in the film. While there are the dumb marines, Hicks, Vasquez, and Hudson either leave a lasting impression or remain quotable. Newt is not your typical kid character. Most kid characters in films get annoying, however Newt is a lot fun to watch. She is also smart and realizes that the best way to survive against the aliens is to run. The acting in the film is also impressive. Sigourney Weaver returns as Ripley and owns the role so much that it is likely the best performance she has ever given. Hicks, Hudson, and an android named Bishop are all played by Cameron film regulars Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton, and Lance Henriksen. All three of them suit their roles very well. Aliens is another one of those movies that ages so well over time. It probably gets better and better with each viewing. While Alien perfected slow-building, atmospheric tension, Aliens packs more of a punch, and features what I think is Sigourney Weaver's best performance.

He made critics and audiences sit up and notice. The plot of the film follows a group of criminals as they try to identify the rat among them after a botched jewellery store heist.First of all, there may be many individuals who might accuse this film of being high on style and low on substance and I won't completely disagree with them, but when the style is so viscerally mesmerising, I am willing to forgive the slight lack of thematic depth. A huge chunk of the film takes place inside a warehouse sporadically interrupted by flash backs which give us a little background on some of the characters. These scenes in the warehouse considering the context of the plot are absolutely riveting and they pretty much make the film feel like a play at times. The palpable tension in these scenes reminded me a lot of 'Dog Day Afternoon'. The main theme of this film I think is identity. The characters in the film don't know anything about each other including the names. All they know is that they have to professionally carry out a job by trusting each other and working as a team. The audience is also put in a similar position. We don't get to know too much about any of the characters either. We are always kept at a distance intentionally. However we can get some glimpses of the nature and characteristics of certain characters through some of the dialogue and some of their behaviour, but even then it's only glimpses. Throughout the film we see roles being reversed. Genuine bad guys asking each other and trying to figure out who the 'bad guy' among them is, we see a bit of a role reversal in an interrogation scene leading to gory torture, we see good guys doing bad things along with bad guys to win their trust,etc. This film is also a quintessential 90s film. The flashback scenes outside of the warehouse ooze the gritty nature of 90s L.A. with the street graffiti, the crime and the rugged streets, etc. The story is in a way simple, but in the simplicity we see how the lives of criminals ultimately fall apart.I have always felt that Scorsese and Tarantino's directorial styles are somewhat similar. They both have no problems in using bloody violence, they employ deft ways to pay tribute to the films that inspired them in their films, they use music in their films in a very artistic and contextual way and they make films that can be deemed to be 'cool'. All this can be found in 'Reservoir Dogs'. The soundtrack of this film is absolutely fantastic. It brilliantly complements the 'cool'-ness of the visuals. Tarantino likes his set pieces and there are two absolutely brilliantly directed set pieces in this film that gave me goosebumps. The screenplay has to be admired a lot too as it is the screenplay that complements the direction and in a way lays down the scope for Tarantino to create and tension in the film.The acting is brilliant from all involved. There are some lengthy single takes which allow the actors to really go for it and I noticed a lot of method acting throughout especially from Keitel and Buscemi. Keitel, Buscemi and Roth are the ones that impressed me the most. 'Reservoir Dogs' might not be the most deep film that I have ever seen, but I still consider it to be a masterpiece. This is a film where a rookie director showed us his skills behind the camera and gave us an entry to a style of filmmaking that later became a standard to which films made by other directors with similar style came to be compared and being called 'Tarantino-esque'. Yes it is at times self- indulgent, but it still is a visceral experience and one of the best directorial debuts in film history that should never be missed by film lovers.

I finally brought myself to watch it for a second time, and I still don't see the merit. And let me make it clear, to the extent that anyone CAN understand this movie, I do. But for one thing, David Lynch's make-it-up-as-you-go style always leaves a sour taste in my mouth. Don't get me wrong, I like a movie that leaves some things up to the imagination or open to interpretation. But there has to be something concrete underneath it all. For instance, as difficult as it may be to grasp, there is a distinct sequence of events that Luis Bunuel wants to depict in L'Age d'Or; and distinct ideas he wants to invoke. This is why his work is satisfying even to those who don't fully understand it, whereas with Lynch's films, even if you do understand it you're left feeling unsatisfied, as if something was left unfinished. And more than anything, this is an unfinished work a television show that was dismissed and forced into the constraints of the feature film. Characters left undeveloped. Plot lines left unresolved. Ends left loose. It is an entrancing movie, credit where credit is due. There's nothing stale about it. There's purpose behind each shot (however undefined), and the shots themselves are beautiful.

It's an enjoyable, very quick ride, lastly only eighty minutes, but in this short amount of time we experience terrific character development between Goofy and Max, his son who is actually the lead role in this film despite what the title may suggest, it's a very sweet film about the complicated relationship between this father and son, as Goofy must cope with the fact that his little boy is growing up and is no longer interested in spending time with him, in the end the two learn that they both truly love and appreciate one another, and it is a lot more powerful than you would expect a movie with Goofy as a main character to be, I think the conflicted emotions between these family members can stand out as something very relatable to anyone. I do think that, for a children's film, it's a bit too depressing, the first fifty minutes of the movie is mainly Goofy and Max traveling across country together despite both having very different views on their relationship, there are moments where we see Goofy truly feeling like he hit rock bottom and has lost everything he's ever loved, this serves as a great story arc but I felt that it was s bit too dramatic at times and should have had more happy and upbeat moments in between to keep kids happy. The musical numbers in this film are outstanding, all of them have a really happy and feel good tune to it that you can't help but smile to, they also serve as great character development for Max and Goofy, particularly Nobody Else But You, a song that shows how much they truly appreciate each other, and that the father-son bond is still very strong between them despite the difficulties they've had in the past. Funny, sweet and filled with charming characters, A Goofy Movie takes Mickey Mouse's silly sidekick and establishes him as a 3D character, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good family film.

Funny, sweet and filled with charming characters, A Goofy Movie takes Mickey Mouse's silly sidekick and establishes him as a 3D character, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good family film.

It's an enjoyable, very quick ride, lastly only eighty minutes, but in this short amount of time we experience terrific character development between Goofy and Max, his son who is actually the lead role in this film despite what the title may suggest, it's a very sweet film about the complicated relationship between this father and son, as Goofy must cope with the fact that his little boy is growing up and is no longer interested in spending time with him, in the end the two learn that they both truly love and appreciate one another, and it is a lot more powerful than you would expect a movie with Goofy as a main character to be, I think the conflicted emotions between these family members can stand out as something very relatable to anyone.

Even if you're not a fan of westerns, you'll at least have a vague idea as to what it's about. However for those of you who are unsure, it's about greed, war and er, two kinds of people.In 1966, Sergio Leone followed up the unparalleled awesomeness of A Fistful of Dollars and For A Few Dollars More with this gritty tale of the battle-of-wits between three outlaws whose fight for survival is driven not by instinct, but by greed. A somewhat politicised story of greed, there is more to the premise of TGTBTU than brazen immorality. In the powder keg decade that was the 1960s, the anti-war film was becoming increasingly popular thanks to images of U.S troops in Vietnam being projected into households worldwide. Many fans of TGTBTU will even ignore it's anti-war subtext, sadly dismissing the movie as nothing more than a cool cowboy flick. Our three main characters are temporarily sobered by the effects of war, but choose to remain ignorant to it's horrors. Leone isn't only interested in the physical effects of combat, he doesn't hold back from showing it's crippling emotional strain. Take the character of the unnamed Union Captain, who has begun a slow descent into madness and severe alcoholism due to ridiculous military logic. I also found the sight of the thousands of soldiers charging into battle in the film's second half rather haunting, these men aren't going to fight, they're going to be slaughtered. We are transported to a post-apocalyptic world by visuals of towns ravaged by cannon fire and bodies littering a barren landscape. Tongue-in-cheek cynicism is the order of the day and the hanging scenes allocate pinches of dark comedy, after all the movie is a satire. There are great performances all round but the three leads are just excellent. Clint Eastwood's Blondie is great but it is Eli Wallach's Tuco who steals the show. His foul mouthed tantrums are nothing short of humorous and the odds are stacked so ironically against him throughout the film. He also carries one of the coolest pistols ever to feature in a western and the gun store scene is just sublime. The last five minutes of the movie in which he is nearly hanged will always raise a hearty chuckle too. The legend that is Lee Van Cleef played the sadistic Angel Eyes brilliantly, a far cry from the valiant Colonel Mortimer of FAFDM. Although, Van Cleef gets considerably less screen time than Eastwood and Wallach and he is really the most villainous of the three.Of course no Sergio Leone film would be complete without the presence of a poetic Morricone score. You would need to have been living underground all your life not to have heard the iconic title score at least once. Thrillingly roaring over the gorgeous title sequence along with thunderous bursts of rifle and mortar fire, the score denotes the epic that is TGTBTU. Story of a Soldier is chillingly sincere, evoking the film's anti-war theme and The Trio commences the climatic showdown, giving the sequence a pinch of Gothic. Ecstasy of Gold is a truly majestic composition and will forever be one of my favourites. As with the previous two movies, the masterful editing techniques generate the tension brilliantly. Here it isn't the action itself that matters, rather the heavy build-ups of disquieting tension prior to the sharp explosions of gunfire. The film climaxes with the amazingly operatic triello(three way showdown)in which Leone relishes those continuous tight close-ups. Spectacularly taut, I still have to force myself to watch even on a fourth viewing. Heralding a new style of suspense, Leone creates a superbly baroque feel and the movie's violence as a whole is so aestheticized that it becomes lyrical. He spent AFOD and FAFDM practising the craft of tension and by this movie he had become a master of that craft, although the triello is such a phenomenon in itself that the entire sequence could be a short film on it's own. TGTBTU features impressive stunt-work and special effects(the controversial destruction of the bridge was fantastic!)and the aforementioned battle scene and subsequent bombardment were both extremely tense. The movie is set during the New Mexico campaign of 1862 and maintains authenticity by making reference to prominent historical figures such as Abraham Lincoln, General Sibley, Lee, Grant and Colonel Edward Canby. It is also a prequel to AFOD and FAFDM as they are set several years after the civil war.Nobody will disagree that Sergio Leone revolutionised the western genre and this movie itself will forever be a pioneering force. Arguably the best film of the three, the Dollars trilogy goes out with a thunderous bang and an effect that no modern director can ever dream of achieving. 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"28 August 2015","score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" If ever there was a movie that needed no explanation plot wise, it is The Good, The Bad and The Ugly.

Late one night (long after midnight) Sylvia witnesses a red-headed man assaulting a young woman outside of Terry's bedroom window. Trying to do the right thing &#x96; without implicating Sylvia's faithlessness &#x96; Terry calls the Baltimore police. He provides the two detectives who visit him (Quirke = Carl Lumlee, Jessup = Frederick Coffin) the assailant's description as provided by Sylvia. But it is not smooth sailing for Terry, as he obviously cannot identify the suspect at the police line-up in the presence of the victim Denise Connolly (Elizabeth McGovern). On a hunch, Terry follows one of the suspects, Carl Henderson (Brad Greenquist) to his workplace at the Patapsco Shipyard. After that, he tails Henderson to the Fells Point Saloon, where an active and wild blonde (Sara Carlson) dances on tables and gets everyone's attention. By the next day the sexy blonde is dead. A serial rapist- murderer is on the loose. Terry returns to the police headquarters and makes a statement to help the lawmen obtain a search warrant on Henderson. But it seems that no one remembered Henderson at the bar, as he remained in the background drinking a beer all alone. Furthermore, nothing incriminating was found at Henderson's place &#x96; no fingerprints, no blood samples, no fibers. There is no proof that Henderson is a rapist\/murderer. But at least there is the assault charge as reported by Terry that will drag Henderson in court and probably put him behind bars for a while. At court we finally discover that Terry wears contact lenses. Yikes! What was he thinking when he called the police in the first place? Didn't Sylvia know this fact? Of course his testimony doesn't hold up, despite the attempt of Sylvia (as a spectator) to coach him. The case is dismissed for insufficient evidence and the police are ticked off. What Terry does not know is that Sylvia's feeble attempt at coaching was noticed by both the victim, Denise, and the suspect, Henderson.Returning to his apartment, Terry is approached by a woman &#x96; a neighbor &#x96; who tells him detectives came by and asked questions about him. Some of what she said contradicted some of Terry's previous statements. Then Denise stops by and tells Terry that she saw Sylvia's actions in the courtroom. Denise was not amused. Meanwhile police suspicion has focused on Terry, who is in a dilemma, while Sylvia, who was of no help, says goodbye. She (sort of) confesses to her husband, Collin, about her affair and he forgives her. At a formal ballet, in which the principals in the movie attend, Henderson stabs Sylvia to death to remove a potential witness against him. How Henderson knew she was there is beyond understanding. Of course, people in attendance believe that Terry is the assailant, so he flees. He ends up in Denise's apartment, and she decides to help him. They talk a good deal and work out a single-minded scheme to trap Henderson. They call the detectives and tail Henderson to Edgar's Solid Gold, a dive. Denise will be a lure to smoke out the murderer. You just know something will not go as planned. It gets a little ridiculous, and there are strange coincidences that pop up. To name just two (1) the large beer truck delivering late at night that obscures vision and (2) the dim-wit who just happens to hog the telephone booth at the worst possible time. In the end there is a wild fight between the protagonist and the antagonist. Steve Guttenburg is no Jimmy Stewart, and Isabelle Huppert is no Grace Kelly. Furthermore, Huppert's character is totally unlikeable because of her adultery, selfishness, and detachment.

It's hard to explain, but much like Mulholland Drive, I wanted to look up more about the film after I watched it. It's not a film that allows you to go back to your normal life before you sit down and think about what you just saw. I cant believe I hadn't watched the movie until now, but I'm also jealous of people who haven't seen it. It's one of those movies that transcends the screen and becomes more than just something you watched, it's something you experienced.It's 2015 and Jake Gyllenhaal is one of the top actors in the world, but way back in 2001 that wasn't the case. In fact, Donnie Darko was one of the first movies to showcase what he had to offer. I will still maintain that the most impressive thing Gyllenhaal does is create a character with his eyes. Everything goes through his subtle eye movements and gestures. Take a look back at his performance in Nightcrawler or Prisoners and analyze how much his eyes define his character. He may very well be the best actor working today. As Donnie, he was able to showcase just how good he can be at nailing a character with inner demons. None more terrifying than Frank, the strange rabbit who appears frequently throughout Donnie's dreams. More importantly, Jake gives us a character who you sympathize with even after all of the horrible things he has done. Not many people can say that.For most of the film, it's hard to figure out just what is going on. Not just because of the huge cast and seemingly several important characters to the plot, but because the film juggles many different genres all in one. It's a psychological thriller at heart, but mixed in is sci-fi, horror, crime, and even a little bit of romance. It's actually probably because of those many genres that I feel the films main weaknesses derive from. The tone is shifting a lot throughout the film and the music constantly switches from being a 90's high school angst film to a dark twisted psychological mystery film a lot.But overall it's a really good film. The phrase keeps you on the edge of your seat can be considered an understatement for Darko. The two hours sped by and I honestly didn't want it to end. Even after the twisted ending, I wanted to see where these characters went. Speaking of characters, it's worth mentioning how good all of the other actors are here. Maggie Gyllenhaal, playing Donnie's sister, looks just about as stunning as she's ever been, and is also pretty darn good in the role too. Jena Malone in one of her first major roles definitely carries her own weight as the lead female and love interest to Donnie. But Drew Barrymore, Patrick Swayze, and Mary McDonnell all make their presence felt here.So of course, then comes the question of what my opinion is on the ending of the film. While in some senses it's ambiguous, I don't think it's beyond belief to think that the ending was meticulously crafted in order for us to debate for years to come. I've done my research and am satisfied with what I believe to be the fate of all the characters. But one of the biggest takeaways from the film I found was the inspiration the film seemed to take from David Lynch. Even though Mulholland Drive came out the same year, it really seemed to take a whole lot from that type of storytelling. If you told me Lynch directed Donnie Darko I would have believed you.

Second fun fact the Beauty and the Beast story also inspired Miyazaki to make Princess Mononoke, one my personal favorites, a movie you will be seeing far higher on this list, the highest grossing movie ever made in Japan and the first animated movie to ever win Japan's version of the Oscars. Kinda weird how one story can inspire two relatively similar great movies on two different ends of the world.But of course, the Disney version is a more faithful adaption. And the version we will be discussing today.If The Little Mermaid started the Disney Renaissance, this movie brought it roaring to life. Many (myself not included) consider this to be the high point of the period, the film where the music, the characters, the animation, and the plot come together to form one insurmountable masterwork. And there is a case to be made for that. You can feel as you watch the movie that this was made by a studio at the top of its game. It may not be the best Disney movie, but I do believe it do be the least flawed. There is nothing wrong with the movie; across the board it excels.Belle is the most fleshed out Disney heroine to this point and arguable the most fleshed out ever. Personally, I prefer Ariel just because while the redhead feels alive and energetic, Belle feels a bit too perfect. But even so, the perfection is not the forced, morality-included kind that makes me hate Superman. It just does seem like she is just a legitimately nice and smart person. I have a friend like that; she's amazing. And just like her, while Belle may be a bit too goody, there is no doubt that she seems real and earnest.Of course, she is not the only character, though I would not mind if she were. The Beast is well-acted. He is able to pull to be fearsome and intimidating without surrendering his humanity. As such, the character development seems natural and flowing. You feel why he does what he does; you emphasize with him. My only qualm is one that many people have had that his voice after he turns back is underwhelming to say the least. But if that's seriously the biggest complaint I can voice against this movie, and it is, then it is doing something right.Gaston is also done well; there are few villains in movie history who are both able to induce fear and laughs; Gaston is one of them. He walks the tightrope of being over-the-top without losing his human desires and ambitions. The scenes he and Belle share are legitimately creepy at best. But once more, you can see where he's coming from, though you don't agree with him. Great character work here.The plot is basic, but well-done. I've...used variations of that phrase quite often, haven't I? So be it; I guess I just tend towards movies like that. Anyways...it's amazing how few people pick up on the nuances that make films like this work. It's not the grand structure that makes it so effect; but rather the little things that build tension and drama like one line or one extra scene. Creative genius is fickle, but not unpredictable, not unless you aren't sensitive to it.But nothing trumps the animation. While I prefer the stark colors of the Lion King, I will say that this is the objectively best-animated movie in the DisRen. In fact, I say that it is the best-looking traditionally-animated movie ever made in the West. Every frame looks like a million dollar painting. Often, I find myself stopping the movie and just staring at the animation. Belle feels alive and full of vigor. The town feels quaint and peaceful with a tint of unease. The Beast's Castle is foreboding and grand but not cold. This is one of those films that makes me want to turn into an animated character just to immerse myself in the world.If the sterling animation arouses these feelings, the sweeping score amplifies it. While not as majestic as Lion King's, this soundtrack is emotional and deep, making every moment feel earned. I would even argue that no movie has as well captured the magic of the medieval-Renaissance era atmosphere as well as this one. There are scores that are thumping and sprawling, adding scale to the movie. There are scores that are intimate and romantic, letting the moment hang with passion in the air. This film does both.In its most famous song, it declares that the story is 'a tale as old as time.' I think this movie will last as long as that. I can safely say that there is not a film as good as Beauty in the Beast that is as good at doing what Beauty in the Beast does best better than Beauty in the Beast.

The entirety of the film has an old-timey Saturday matinée feel to it, and although it doesn't rise to the level of a blockbuster summer feature, you could describe it to a novice as perhaps the best B movie of cinema's modern era. Much of the film's core appeal goes back to the spirited acting Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz supply, and to their significant chemistry together. Although romance must take a back seat to danger in an archaeology adventure flick, it bears noting that their chemistry as a couple is decidedly more compelling than the Indy and Marian pairing in Raiders.

For example, one of the main 'good guys' has an Australian accent. That's it. That's his whole character.The main plot could have easily come from CSI Miami. All the writing is just an excuse to show more and more stunts and a few lackluster explosions. The acting is appalling. The writer has no idea how to write banter, and the acting coach doesn't know how to get people to say it. Even Anthony Hopkins seems to have forgotten how to say words in this movie, and its incredibly distracting. Hopkins in particular, actually, seems to be hamming his way through a local business commercial. At one point it did have me, and I could excuse the Joel Schumacher style antics (Im quite surprised he didn't direct MIII). The female lead is convincing enough at first, and Ethan Hunt's method of recruiting her draws the viewer in. But then we go on to realise even she has no personality, just the old 'I'm a female thief' motif. This movie actually expects us to identify the characters with tropes and just let it go.Where it really lost me was the ever increasingly outrageous fight scenes. At one point, the movie goes into literally a 26 minute chase scene followed by a 6 minute hand-to-hand combat scene.

MIII is not trying to communicate anything in tone. That's mainly because many scenes are straight takes or homages to other movies and do not mold well with MIII's campy blockbuster vibe.On the upside, though, it has good cinematography when its not idiotically zooming in objects and faces, showing flashbacks of events that happened 5 minutes ago, and cutting away from action to save from paying for an actual effects\/stunt department (instead of the film school students they seem to have hired to pump out this trite).

When he suffers a horrible traffic accident thanks to a car losing its tire, it takes his right arm. A breakthrough arm surgery through a grafting procedure sees that Fahey will not be without the missing limb...it comes with a price. The arm, he soon discovers, was taken from a serial killer eventually executed. Two other men also received body parts from the killer in surgeries by Dr. Agatha Webb (Lindsay Duncan), a painter named Remo Lacey (Brad Dourif) and a young man named Mark Draper (Peter Murnik) who had both legs applied after spending time in a wheelchair without them. Eventually, though, someone is coming to collect.I found some of the plot rather fascinating, as Fahey's Bill Crushank truly dedicates himself to understanding where evil comes from, and how the arm attached to him is ruining his life. The arm is violent, smacking his son and nearly choking his wife while he was sleeping in bed. He can see the murders in his dreams committed by the killer, and Bill increasingly has that gnawing feeling the murder's influence is taking hold of him. Reaching out to the others (Mark's legs cause him to nearly wreck into ongoing traffic), he finds that both men are suitably pleased with their new body parts (Remo's painting reflects what the killer sees; he claims the images just come from the air and that he's making far more money since he got his new arm than before when he was creating work for the walls of hotel rooms).The film left me a bit unsatisfied because I think Red has something here that eventually goes off the rails at the end when someone returns to take back the grafted body parts given away. It is really quite bloody and graphically violent (legs gone, a victim going out a window, losing his grip once one of his arms is pulled right from the torso it belongs), but the reasoning is rather loony. A head actually being transplanted and kept from dying, body parts hooked to life support, being pumped with a blood supply and machines, and limbs being confiscated from their rightful owner, with Webb's eventual approval (taking a turn towards mad science) leaves Body Parts deteriorating into camp. It left me rather awestruck after following Bill through the travails of this arm causing him much grief that the film decides to turn loose a serial killer towards the end seemingly for shock value. Kim Delaney is the wife of Fahey, just unable to tolerate her husband's danger to her and the children. I had forgotten just how beautiful Kim was or that she was in this movie. The car crash that caused Fahey to need the arm is horrific, the crime scene with the missing legs is gruesome, and Dourif's character is totally enthusiastic about what the arm has done for his life (for the better), not discouraged by Fahey's misery and forewarning about what the body parts might have wrong with them. Dourif's performance is lively and energetic, I'll give him that. I have seen him better, though. I guess his performance fits the character he's provided a lease on life anew, Bill's concerns pale in comparison to the profit afforded to him. Webb's attitude towards Bill regarding his desire to have the arm removed, not concealing her staggering apathy and disregard for his well being and hope to get rid of it so he can get his life back provides the film quite a cold and remoresless sociopath.

Webb's devotion to her work, even if it is harmful to the recipients of the parts she grafts to patients presents her as quite the villain, deserved of her eventual fate.

Moustappha Akkad said himself that they should have waited another year to polish the script before they filmed another sequel, and it tells. Dominique Girard rewrote the script while filming was going on, and it shows. Characters are so one-dimensional, they do the best they can with a crap script, and fans have no idea where the film is supposed to be going. This was nothing but a quick cash grab, which never work out. The Tina character is THE most annoying character in the franchise. Killing Rachel off was just stupid and silly, and Jamie having a psychic connection to her uncle? Who wrote this crap?!It's no wonder that the director has yet to make another American horror film after this debacle. Stray away from this crap at all cost.
