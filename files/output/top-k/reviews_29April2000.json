I saw it in theatres when it came out and that movie was so funny, that I had recently just bought it.  Robin Williams plays a man who's suicidal at first but with the help of patients, he gets this passion of wanting to help others.  When I rewatched this movie, I noticed that Patch Adams and I have a lot in common.  We want to help others and we're nice to women no matter how they treat us and just watching the movie, I put myself in Patch's place when he and Carin are together and it just makes me imagine.  The only part that really stunk was when Carin died.  That really broke my heart, especially when Patch cried over her coffin.  Overall, this movie was great and I recommend it to everybody.
