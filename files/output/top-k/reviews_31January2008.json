[{"date":"31 January 2008","score":"","review":" Things get off to quite a vicious and visceral start in this flavorful take on the early life of Queen Elizabeth I as three protestants are roughly shorn and then burned at the stake. It's a fairly unforgettable sequence that grabs the attention and, for the most part, the film continues to do so from then on, though nothing quite tops the opening for sheer savagery. Blanchett portrays the title future monarch who is in exile due to her claim to the British throne, currently occupied by her older half-sister Burke. When her time comes to ascend, she is faced with powerful enemies such as Eccleston and powerful allies such as Rush while the royal court is in a constant state of hubbub over her and her political decisions. One pressure she is under involves marrying and producing an heir, something she would like to do with her childhood love Fiennes, but which she can't due to his status. French nobleman Cassel is offered to her as an option, but proves unacceptable as well. Meanwhile, she is battling Scotland, which is under the rule of Ardant, yet another enemy. Blanchett manages to juggle the affairs of state and the affairs of the heart while assassins wait around every other corner. As most viewers know, she manages to succeed in most areas and proceeds to a long and mostly illustrious reign. Blanchett is striking and exceptional in this, one of her early film roles. She balances a whole range of emotions for a legendary personage without ever heading over the top. Rush lends perfect support. The two had worked together before in theatre and enjoyed a built-in rapport. Eccleston is appropriately exasperated and vengeful while Fiennes is endearingly loving and protective. Attenborough, frequently a hammy actor, displays some of that quality here, but not fatally so. Ardant, Cassel and Burke provide the right amount of zest in their scenes. Gielgud appears very briefly as an outraged Pope and Craig has an early role as one his brutal henchmen. The story plays fast and loose with some historical facts, though its visual attributes cannot be denied, nor can the star-making performance of its leading actress. In an ironic twist, both Rush and Fiennes starred in another 1998 film that had appearances from Elizabeth I (played by Dame Judi Dench) &#150; Shakespeare in Love. The leading lady of that film, Gwyneth Paltrow, was given the Oscar over Blanchett in a preposterous move by the Academy (thus also missing the chance to reward two actresses in two different films who were playing the same person as Dench won for Best Supporting Actress that year.) It's a vivid, captivating take on a fascinating subject though it isn't always easy for non-historians to figure out exactly what is taking place at any given moment. Fortunately, the strong performances and stylish direction keep the momentum going and some title cards at the beginning help set the stage for what comes after. Almost a decade later, Blanchett returned to the role for a sequel that details the events occurring in Elizabeth's reign after this film.

The film contains numerous incidences in which the events that transpire are either unrealistic, unimaginative or ridiculous in their respective concepts. 3000 Miles to Graceland is a film that cross contaminates genres, uses its characters in a silly and contradictory manner and feels the need to blast us with dumb action when it thinks we might be getting bored.I've always thought that Christian Slater has had one of the worst agents a film star could ever have. His career has been so up and down, playing odd roles in obscure films that you would think he was better than; whilst seemingly trying to adapt to the comedy genre more than anything else. Here, he is reunited with Kevin Costner after a ten year gap between Robin Hood Prince of Thieves and this and he makes up a band of crooks also consisting of Kurt Russell and David Arquette. The film's most impressive sequence or chain of events occur in its opening twenty five to thirty minutes, the exact time it takes for a film to 'set the scene' so to speak. After some introduction of the characters, an interesting scene happens in the car on the way to the Casino they will rob Thomas Murphy (Costner) orders out an African American member of their gang to let Michael Zane (Russell) sit in the front with him. From here, the emphasis is on the two riding in the front; the three in the back joke and mess around; cracking jokes and generally being a nuisance. Costner has already established authority in the gang by ordering out a fellow member and it's here that the two in the front seats are established as adults whilst three in the back more resemble children with their foolery. At one point, Arquette's character cracks a joke that forces Costner's character to actually stop the car, turn around and give him an ear full &#150; as if an adult were lecturing a child. This not only creates tension early on but establishes Murphy as a figure of authority or someone not to be tangled with therefore it is no surprise the person sitting next to Murphy is Kurt Russell's character, Zane; whom the film will revolve around in due course.When they arrive at the casino, the film moves up another gear and gives us a great shootout in which these men rob the casino's fault. Zane says that everyone robs banks these days but nobody expects a Casino to get ripped off; further emphasising the Reservoir Dogs mentality that banks are a clichéd thing to rob (remember they went to a jewellers). During this scene, we get a lot of good choreographing and some decent violence. Even in its best scene, the film still suffers the security guards are pathetically weak bodied foils and the African American character is rather ashamedly the only one to die; his body tossed away after futile attempts to save him. During the film at that point, I thought the death may be a large spoiler but given the route the film goes down following the robbery, it is a highly insignificant incident.What follows is a film that really wants to be Reservoir Dogs with a touch of the buddy film formula before settling on a road movie route. This is twinned with seemingly pointless scenes that cut back to two highly ranked lawmen who look bored and uninterested in their work and are there to merely crack one-liners between the two of them. The film then struggles with its logic and incident in such a clumsy manner that it comes close to detaching its characters from entirely being human beings. Slater's character demands the dead man's cut and when tensions rise, things happen. It is here that I was unclear if Murphy's ideas to do what he did was a direct result of Slater's actions in wanting to keep the cut OR if Murphy had it planned the whole time to do what he did. If he did have it planned the whole time, why was Zane not properly finished off following being incapacitated? The other inconsistency which is directly the source of the films love story comes in the form of Courtney Cox's character Cybil Waingrow. Waingrow comes a cross as a bit of a loose woman given the fact she has a son; no husband; wears revealing outfits; clothes too small for her and sleeps with a guy within an hour of knowing him. Here, she leaves her son with Zane to go off chasing money she doesn't even know she'll get. Later the script embarrassingly puts it down to because she really trusts and loves Zane which was unconvincing and felt artificial. The kid in question is Jesse (Kaye) who punches way above his weight in terms of dialogue and persona, acting like someone twenty years his elder in a rather embarrassing manner; not embarrassing because of poor acting but due to poor characterisation. There is also the question raised conforming to why Zane doesn't ditch the kid in the first place; seemingly because he needs him Jesse works out to report the car stolen, bringing both Zane and Murphy together in a jail; Murphy then being able to call in a helicopter and to set up the film's climax before we're anywhere near it. This film may use up all its sense and suspense early on but it keeps up its energy rate. However, a lagging script and a finale straight out of a Segal\/van Damme film really leaves a nasty taste in the mouth with a feeling that although Russell and Costner do well with what they've got; they deserve a bit better than this.

The spy thriller is great for blockbuster audiences, but to make it into a strong romantic drama is always tricky, as there's the chance for too much one-dimensional theatrics or more attention paid to the plot convolutions than actual human emotions. Nikita squares this problem away just with the protagonist a young punk (Anne Parillaud, in her most recognizable, near star-making performance) who kills a cop in the midst of a shoot-out is sentenced to life, but then sort of resurrected following the lead of a member of a covert spy organization, and given an ultimatum become a spy\/assassin, or die. She complies, and in a few years time turns into Josephine, who gets orders on the outside from time to time to do tasks like dress up in a maid's outfit to serve potential targets, or to ready herself to kill someone long-range at a moment's notice.Besson crafts his main story by creating a sort of love triangle between Nikita\/Josephine\/Marie, her boss Bob, and her conventional lover Marco, a grocery store cashier who doesn't know what she really does. Besson tools with the elements for a much more conventional thriller, and from time to time it could appear like La Femme Nikita will veer into that realm and not return. But Besson is smart; he crafts the first hour like a kind of 'Taming of the Shrew' saga (or 'Taming of a Shrill Bad-ass'), filled with juicy, dark humor ranging from the ultra-violent (pencil in the hand anyone?) to the silly and playful (training with karate instructors). And as pure director of action sequences Besson shows himself as one of the more distinct masters; it's succinctly fresh and tense while holding the ingredients for what mainstream audiences crave, chiefly in that centerpiece as she is told to kill someone on the night of a seemingly hot date with Bob. Even in the little things, like the scene where she watches the spy put together the concoction for the target in the hotel, works on the purest technical terms.But La Femme Nikita, for the most part, also works on emotional levels too. Besson won't be above throwing in a hard-boiled killer in the midst (Jean Reno's Victor, my favorite supporting character if only for a few pivotal scenes, and a precursor to Leon), but he'll also subvert it just a tinge for good measure. I loved seeing when Josephine has to take out the woman in Venice, her shot in sight, and is moved to tears through the words that Marco speaks to her, truthfully, not in any terms that deem him as the boring safe character, but as her kind of salvation from a life that she's been forced into as a final alternative. As happens often in Besson's work, in fact, the female character is put into a realm of personal chaos that is created by or leads to murder and, at the least, harrowing times with the one she cares for or about (i.e. Portman in Leon, Leeloo in Fifth Element, Joan of Arc, even Angela in Angel-A). It's not simply a gimmick in having the character be a woman- it's essential to Besson's track as a filmmaker, and Praillaud is excellent for the sort of ups and downs the character goes through, sometimes in the same scene! This isn't to say there are a few minor liabilities, if only from my perspective the music is usually effective in that early electronic-techno beat style for a modern thriller, yet sometimes it's also a cross between a soft-core porn and Weather channel muzak; the ending felt abrupt, or at least on a first viewing (albeit it's hard to top the scene at the ambassador's HQ); and, as a minor criticism, what happened to showing how Nikita learns how to smile? (Seems a little crucial as something of her personality that's skipped over, when made to seem like a big stepping stone by Jeanne Moreau's enigmatic character.) Otherwise, a must-see, and one of Besson's best films.

Word is Tom Cruise was unhappy with such connotations, but no-one really knows why the references were omitted. This leaves us with something less than Rice's fascinating tale which many have called a literary classic of its genre, yet Jordan and Rice (who adapted her original story for the screen) still deliver a disturbing and tragic film about one man's shattered dream of immortality and his struggle to come to terms with what he is.Cruise justifies the rave reviews he's been receiving (who better than Ann Rice to blow his trumpet after publicly canning him when he was cast) for his portrayal of the malevolently evil LeStat, a vampire who has no qualms about his disposition and eccentric taste. In fact he rather enjoys the sport of luring his next victim for a feed, aristocratic or Creole preferably. His chosen companion is Louis, a broken man after the loss of his wife and child, he desperately yearns for a way out, and so recklessly takes LeStat up on his offer of a new life with no pain or suffering. Brad Pitt manages to outshine Mr. Cruise in a superb showing as a vampire so guilt ridden about his blood lust that he cannot bear to face another night of horror. So downcast is he that LeStat believes they may benefit from adopting a new companion and so young Claudia (Kirsten Dunst in a wickedly excellent performance) becomes a sort of surrogate daughter with a hunger to match that of her maker.Adding to the devilish goings on are European vampires Armand (Antonio Banderas), a lonely but heartless leader, and Santiago (Stephen Rea), a ruthless henchman. Christian Slater also drops by as the interviewer, a role originally slated for River Phoenix who sadly passed away before filming could be completed. His untimely death (at only 23) shocked legions of fans who had toted him as the next James Dean, perhaps an all too accurate assessment of a very talented young actor. Slater assumes the part admirably, and he donated his salary to some of River's favourite charities in honour of his memory.A warning then for the faint hearted or those of you who are easily spooked. Although The Vampire Chronicles is not a thriller that will have you hitting the roof every three minutes, it is most definitely unnerving, so those prone to nightmares are well advised to stay away. Stan Winston's make-up and special f\/x are all convincing enough to give you the shivers, and there's little left to the imagination.Jordan successfully stops things from becoming gratuitous however, and though Vampire is at times self-interested and perhaps overlong, he has once again triumphed with a picture that won't surprise you quite as much as The Crying Game, but it certainly will haunt you with images and characters that will stay with you long after you've left the theatre.Monday, January 2, 1995 - Village Centre Melbourne ","genre":null},{"date":"31 January 2008","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Visual splendour and strong acting dominate this meandering, self indulgent epic of the life of one very miserable vampire.Neil Jordan (The Crying Game) has filmed Ann Rice's epic novel with distinctly dark overtones both visually and comically in order to enhance the evil mood, yet the homosexuality of some characters, clearly prevalent in the book, is barely hinted at here.

I find it a little surprising that the user rating for this movie is about 6.5, and movies like Die Hard 4 are at an 8 or so.

It's hard to believe that it's thirty seven years later, and I can still remember the thoughts going through my head while watching the film with my best friend. Like marveling at Peter Boyle's characterization of the ultimate redneck, sure to typecast him the rest of his career (Oh, how wrong!), and how the counter culture jarred the sensibilities of most of the country. To this day, my buddy and I still use Joe Curran's line from my summary above when faced with a dilemma; curious how a simple line like that can stay with you for decades.It's curious to read comments about the film from others on this board, particularly the ones stating that the film has a dated quality and how over the top the characters were. Still, if you were around during that time, the picture gives a pretty accurate portrayal of the polar opposites that existed back then, pretty much side by side as the events in the story reveal. If you really want dated, when was the last time you heard the words Macy's and Gimbel's in the same sentence, or a line like Joe's - Come on, get with the Pepsi generation. For historical perspective, you have that great Nixon poster lingering in one of the background scenes - Would you buy a used car from this man? With minor intricacies like those, director John Avildsen captures many of the subtle but ever present hints of how life was four decades ago.Today's viewing was only the second time I've seen the movie, and I have to admit I don't remember Susan Sarandon in one of the lead roles, but then again, this was her very first picture. The scenes of nudity and free love were something actually quite new and bold at the time, shocking in fact, as film makers began to experiment with their ability to push the envelope of propriety and convention. Joe took a major leap in that regard, particularly since it was a 'mainstream' picture.With the passage of time, the thing that impresses me the most about Peter Boyle was how he overcame the stereotype of Joe Curran to appear in or star in some of my very favorite pieces of work. I mean, how do you go from Joe to that hilarious rendition of 'Puttin' on the Ritz' in Young Frankenstein? And my absolute favorite episode of 'X-Files' has Boyle as Clyde Bruckman, in both a tender and tragic, funny and serious portrayal that turns the tables on Scully and Mulder more than once. And as a career capper, Frank Barone has to be one of the funniest characters in the history of television. Even repeat episodes in syndication are funny as he-- whenever the elder Barone lets loose with one of his observations. He is one actor that this viewer sorely misses already.

Would it not make more sense to make the message interesting to those who supposedly need to hear it? I've never read any of the Left Behind books, but, based on what I've heard about them, it would seem to me that the authors have little conception of how international conflict manifests.There are four core things that really sink this film; 1) director Vic Sarin has little concept of the larger story being told, 2) whoever shot this was uninspired for the project, 3) there is a distinct lack of vision for the film, and, finally, 4) the plot is silly and stupid.For a film that's supposed to tell of what would become the opening stages of the final battle on Earth between God and God's enemies, this thing is highly sanitized. Then again it is meant for a Christian audience, even though same said folks want to spread their message, but nevermind. The film didn't need huge amounts of swearing, nor pornographic gore to show the horrors of God's former right-hand angel as he wages war on Earth, but I felt like I was reading the Highlights Version of the Civil War. Or in this case a supposed future civil war.On top of that, there's a real disconnect between what the Carpathea character is supposed to be, and what he's able to do on terra-firma as a human being with demonic DNA. If he's so invulnerable, and otherwise unassailable, then why in the world does he need a following to wage war against the Almighty? Why does he need a lear jet to get around the globe? Why have any Earthly implements at all? How did he get born? But again, nevermind.A film about biblical apocalypse needs some grounding. But this thing is so wrapped up in being marketed to fundamentalists that it loses the larger audience that it was trying to garnish. Video game quality CGI effects in the opening sequence should be a real clue to the would be viewer. And trying to pass off rural North America for Jerusalem seems to have been done more for budgetary considerations than anything else.At best this film is a curiosity. If you want to see what kind of a film a director of Indian decent can make for fundamentalist Christian backers (including Barnes and Noble), then give it a whirl. Otherwise, if you must see some fire-and-brimstone on your TV, then do yourself a favor and rent or buy Chuck Heston's The Ten Commandments--from an era when Hollywood knew how to make these kinds of flicks.

Calling it 'preachy' really doesn't do it justice &#150; and not just in the sneery way the modern reader might feel inclined to read that comment. And any modern-day film-maker intent on making a similar film with a message must either be be lucky enough to be married to the studio boss' son or daughter or will have to content him or herself with making a low-budget movie for the indie market. Gentleman's Agreement ostensibly concerns itself with post-war anti-semitism when Jews were persona non grata in many 'restricted' WASP establishments however distinguished, rich or otherwise notable that Jew might be. (And, very ironically, getting backing for this film in post-war Hollywood was probably as easy as kicking in an open door.) But now that - or at least I, a 'gentile', assume &#150; things aren't half as tough for Jews, discrimination continues. Blacks, gays and lesbians, and many other minorities continue to feel the cutting edge of others abject disdain. Perhaps things aren't as bad in our cities, but move to any of our more rural communities and things are perhaps not quite as easygoing. What distinguishes Gentleman's Agreement and what makes it a better film than it might have been in the hands of a less capable director is that it acknowledges both the subtlety of discrimination and that those who inadvertently perpetuate discrimination are not necessarily evil. They are thoughtless, perhaps, or crave the approbation of their peers a little too much. Often they simply want to fit in, not rock the boat, be accepted, and they find it easier to run with the hounds than stand up for what on greater reflection they might acknowledge to be the harder, but more moral position. Not every one of the 60 odd million 1930s Germans was evil. In fact very few of them were, no more than you would find in any cross section of any society any where. But what allowed the Nazi evil to flourish was the unthinking acquiesence of those millions. This is, by extrapolation the point this film makes, and despite having been made over 60 years ago, it is a point which is still valid today and will always be valid whenever and wherever someone is discriminated against. But what also distinguishes this film is that the story employed to get this &#151; well preachy &#151; message over is quite engrossing, adding as it does a love story, a friendship and believable mother\/son and father\/son relationships into the equation. In lesser hands with less talented actors it might well have not come off. Thankfully it does, despite the sermon.
