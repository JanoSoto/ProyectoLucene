Hands off to Darren Aronofsky for a such a beautiful piece of work. If you're looking for entertainment then this is not where you should be looking at because this is certainly not a feel good kinda film. The movie is about four people who become victims of drug addiction. The director has mainly concentrated on misery and the darker side of emotions. From start to finish it's a sad yet interesting and clever film. Darren's style of brutal portrayal of a story is evident.Coming to the music score, well it's definitely remarkable. It's kept simple and subtle yet so moving. The background score makes the scene even more dramatic and scintillating than it already is and it keeps us hooked to the screen till the end.The cinematography is simply brilliant. The wide angle shots, the close ups of the characters, the effects is perfect for this genre. Overall, Requiem for a Dream is a hard hitting, depressing, disturbing yet beautifully made which makes it hard not to watch it. So I recommend this movie for anyone because it brings out emotions that you never knew you had it in you.

But the thing is, most of these guys, with some exceptions in scenes, they're without redeeming characteristics. The film might be a fine anti-Cocaine ad, to be sure, as there's barely a scene where someone isn't snuffing up the nose (it was filmed in 1998 but written back in the early 80's, which makes just a little more sense), but as far as giving any thing close to a (bleep) about these guys is tough. And I know that's not the main goal, I know it's not. We're meant to wallow in with these men who have all of this time to luxuriate in bulls*** and do their drugs and screw around with girls like Anna Paquin (who, I did like, is never identified by age making it all the more questionable), and how they are at best misogynistic and at worst... well, SVU handles guys like these sometimes pretty well.Perhaps the intention in David Rabe's script, and certainly I could see it being that for the stage where it was originally done, is that they're in a nihilistic circle of their own making, filled with drug- laden anecdotes and partying and screwing around and all that stuff that Hollywood people do (and hey, it's the world by Mulholland drive so it's that kind of terrain), and they're just trying to get by each their own way. But it's how characters speak that becomes uneven. Sean Penn's Eddie is a paranoid mess who is fine for a few minutes when we see him clean and sober, and then right back to being a dick as soon as he's back on the powder. Kevin Spacey's Nicky seems more cool-headed and rational, but is so vindictive that, perhaps comparatively, comes off best but among the real world still fails at humanity (maybe by default). And Phil, that's a whole other ball of wax, a man so neurotic he makes Woody Allen characters look like the Beaver Cleavers.The women are a little more of a mixed lot, with Darlene (Robin Wright Penn, not too oddly enough Sean's wife) the most sane and clear-headed and rational. It's mostly in Hurlyburly a question of being so thick into the muck of decay that it just becomes self-indulgent. And the way characters speak tends to go on and on, mostly with a guy like Phil who just has too many words up his sleeve for someone who should have more of an instinctual, guttural way of talking like a primitive beast. It's not the talk of movie people but theater, and that's one of the big slip ups here, and not an uncommon one with adaptations which is to not have the right tone for the screen. Sometimes the dialog can be agreeable, maybe close to funny (the scene where Phil throws Meg Ryan's character out of the car, and what leads up to it, is amazing). But too much of it is over-loaded with language.The acting should be what saves it. Sometimes it does. I mean, look who is over here after all, Oscar winners and other notables. But when Garry Shandling ends up really taking the acting prize (and most notably with a scene where he talks with Penn through a glass table) you know there's something not quite right. Spacey is fine but he could do this part in his sleep; more curious would've been to see Christopher Walken, who originated the role on Broadway, in the role as it would've been so unusual for him. Penn has his moments where he connects emotionally, but the rest of it is in such predictable ham-bone mode that it becomes laughable; most excruciating is a scene where he keeps begging Meg Ryan for a BJ, and it gets to a point where Tommy Wiseau would be needed as a dramatic stand-in. You're tearing me apart, movie!Palminteri seems the most mis-cast though; I never really believed much of what he was saying, and only once or twice did it look like he was even slightly well-off in the role. He keeps on making these things with how he speaks (though it might be akin to how Phil talks) and it's just odd and embarrassing, considering that the man can act in the right role, usually in urban street-wise stuff. A neurotic is not for him, and he has to play one to such a psychotic extent and looks a little dumbfounded in some scenes why he's even there! And it's not all on the director's fault, at least, maybe, I wouldn't think so entirely. He does keep some scenes moving along to try and bring some cinematic quality to it. But when it stalls into its theater-setting, it shows. I don't want to be too hard on the movie, and yet it's tough when there's such high stakes a dynamite cast, a drug-fueled set-up that allows for so much potential drama. The results should be fantastic. And instead it's the kind of hot-headed pretentious bally-hoo that makes people hate Hollywood people they're heads are so far up their asses they don't know where the sun shines anymore.

Maybe we need to humanize our bestiality, to make it ridiculously human, not to feel like animals. Normal people go perverse to feel alive, and perverse people act conventionally to feel human, normality leads to perversity which fatally gets you back to normality.

Optimism and sadness, fear and nostalgia, desire and passion, wisdom and realization ... beautifully embodied in the beautiful Waltz that made me cry at the end, with my eyes wide open, before shutting them and letting one tear running on my face, a tear to the memory of an immortal genius called ...

Words of wisdom from one Robert Loggia in Brian De Palma's hard-hitting depiction of the violent crime that permeates from greed and power.Our titular character (who, funnily enough, never refers to himself as Scarface throughout the film) is Tony Montana, a refugee from Cuba arriving in the United States in pursuit of the American dream. With the help of Frank Lopez and best buddy Manny Ribera, he climbs to the pinnacle of the cocaine industry, building an enviable empire that naturally leads to a lot of enemies.For all the memorable roles he has had over his career, surely Tony Montana is the role for which the incomparable Al Pacino will be remembered for. The actor has reportedly stated that this character remains his undisputed favourite, and with good reason. Pacino's intense performance is one which was initially criticized for overacting, but it's important to gain an understanding of the character before jumping to such conclusions. Montana is loud, full of hubris and as paranoid as he is ambitious. A more reserved performance would not accurately reflect these traits, which ultimately tell the tragic story of Scarface. Nominated for a Golden Globe back in 1984 on the back of this performance, Pacino brought the character to life, making Montana one of the most instantly-recognisable figures in film, and a character often imitated, but never duplicated.If the cinematography of Scarface had to be a colour, it would be a deep blood red, and not just because of the extreme violence. The sharp, in-close camera-work and energetic soundtrack are typical staples of cheesy 1980s cinema, but they work wonders in this film. Combined with the brutal script by Oliver Stone (who himself was battling a cocaine addiction while working on the film), they contribute in visually assaulting the viewer right from the outset. Where other films engage the audience at some points then lay low in a couple of trough scenes, Scarface starts with the volume turned up to ten and never lets go of the dial, before somehow pushing it up to about twelve for the climax. Despite this, the film never gets too excited for its own good. A couple of powerful scenes between Tony and sister Gina give weight to some people's arguments that he feels a romantic love for his relative, but more importantly, the interplay showcases De Palma's skills in fusing the emotional with the violent in creating a film whose images will be burnt in your mind long after the closing credits.One problem I have with Scarface (which actually has nothing to do with the film itself) is the way some musical artists and, subsequently, members of the younger generation have misconstrued the film's true meaning over time. De Palma makes it very clear by the conclusion that Tony is no hero; he is a tragic figure plucked right out of Ancient Greece and placed in contemporary Miami for us all to judge and learn from. In much the same way that Douglas's Gordon Gekko in 1987's Wall Street served as the inspiration for many people to quit their jobs in the pursuit of becoming ruthless players in the financial game, the message Montana has tried to convey has been swallowed up by the engaging nature of his character, which I suppose is the greatest testament to the overall quality of the film.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

In the Bela Lugosi Dracula, Dracula was portrayed with an almost Bond like stature. However, whether it was Lugosi or just the film making of the times, Dracula lacked just the the charisma to sell it. Now that's just my opinion, but in stating that, it makes my point clearer when I say the Sarandon's performance of the vampire Jerry Dandrige has that charisma so that you buy it when he seduces someone.I compare Dandrige and Dracula because that's what Fright Night is. It's a contemporary (well, in the eighties it was) take on the classic vampire. It doesn't try to create new rules or reboot classic Universal vampire lore. It simply elaborates on it. We never saw what would have happened in Dracula when Dr. Van Helsing holds up the cross. We just saw Lugosi's over the top reaction to its presence. In Fright Night, it's the equivalent of jabbing someone with a red hot brand.Speaking of Van Helsing, Roddy McDowall turns in a very fun turn as Fright Night's interpretation of the character, Peter Vincent. He's a washed up film star who's been reduced to hosting a horror movie show that shows. He has the know how and yet is crippled by his cowardice and greed. In the role of the brave boy, willing to risk life and limb to protect his neighborhood and girlfriend, is young Charley Brewster, played by William Ragsdale. He's the main character, after all, and plays the role with naivety and yet an undying persistence to stop this creature that threatens him and his community. In an all to common parallel is Charley's girlfriend Amy (Amanda Bearse) and his best friend, Evil Ed (Stephen Geoffreys.) They don't believe Charley, but are concerned for him and enlist Vincent's help (with Amy's college fund.) The design of the vampire is the least faithful thing to the classic idea of the vampire. Well, the Universal vampire, anyways. When the vampires become hungry, they turn into more ravenous takes on Nosferatu (which is technically Dracula, the film studio just couldn't afford the rights to the name.) Anyway, the vampires also can transform (as did Dracula.) These effects are pretty good. One of the best involves just a quick effect with a wolves' eyes. The way the scenery blends with the film is also very well done, if not slightly exaggerated.As much as I've been praising this film, however, it's definitely not perfect. A lot of the acting is exaggerated. This problem is easily forgivable, although, because the overacting actually leads to some of the more memorable characters and moments in the film. Second, the screenplay is pretty weak at points and under mines itself when it's trying to be serious and scary and that's leading to my last complaint, which is, coincidentally, my complaint with Dracula, and that is that to me, this film just isn't scary. I mean sure, it's creepy, but if you're like me (a 14 year old boy), there's a strong possibility that this film won't scare you. However, I don't really count this as a strike against it, as it's not as much a flaw with the movie as it is with modern movie goers such as myself.The more I think about this movie, the more I realize how much this film is a contemporary re-telling of Dracula and it's a well made one, too. It's a refreshing break to see a vampire movie that doesn't try to be particularly special with it's portrayal of vampires and in not being special, it BECOMES special. And that's the beauty of Fright Night. And yet, it makes me sad, as it shows just how pathetic vampires have gotten that watching a movie where vampires do what they're supposed to do is such a rare and glorious occurrence. Oh well.

I wasted what felt like a lifetime watching this painful thing waiting for a change of opinion by the end of it...never happened. Why am I being so blunt and telling you this movie is bad? Well...I'll give you just some examples atop of my mind.NASA sends up a group of idiots with zero outer-space experience to save the world rather than...hmm, lets see...Trained Astronauts!While the brave heroes are saving the world, by planting a bomb in an asteroid they crack what are supposed to be funny one liners for comic relief that are actually as funny as a heart attack and fail miserably.We have to sit through a painful scene where Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler feed each other animal crackers...reallyEvery film cliché you will find in this movieAerosmith's now famous song. This is the reason why every time I hear them I wanna go puke.Predictable, lame, trying too hard for tears endingThe only part of the ending that made me cry was when I realized that I could have been doing something more productive with the time I wasted watching this piece of garbage. I only give it a 1 because there is nothing lower. Yes, it's that bad.

Source of inspiration for the complex and thought provoking JFK (1991), the film directed by Costa Gavras is a detailed and enigmatic look into the murder of the Congressman Grigoris Lambakis, occurred in 1963 (the names of the real personalities involved in the case were changed and in most of the parts no names are presented, only their functions). The Congressman (Z in the book) is played by Yves Montand as a powerful figure in Greek opposition, trying to place things in order, fighting an authoritarian government that represses any kind of protests and political ideologies against them. And it was in this dangerous scenery that Z suffered an attempt against his life that led to his death. An complicated investigation of what happened in that day took place - Generals; prosecutors; a neutral judge (Jean-Louis Trintignant); the friends and family of the Congressman; possible suspects; the Comunists; the people who support the government - all of them involved in a labyrinth of lies, crimes and unethical issues exploding into a so-called democratic country.Z is a powerful masterpiece that reveals that movies can be more than just simple entertainment; it urges the viewers to pay attention to the story showing that everyone who lives is involved with politics, wanting to be or not involved with it because it makes part of our lives, it is important and that we must put our faces in the line, protesting against injustices and against the lack of morality in our governments wherever it needed. The writer of the book in which the film was based and the filmmaker already took that chance when presenting Z as a controversial work, that broke barriers in showing the truth on the screen and in the printed media.

Most of these rebel characters are just like zombies, with an unique and dreadful behavior, literally always going for the head of those like Z, with their cubs, sucking Z life away, destroying those who use politics to change their miserable lives.

Great acting by Montand, Trintignant, Jacques Perrin (one of the producers of the film, he plays the seductive photojournalist), Irène Papas, Charles Denner, Bernard Fresson, Renato Salvatori and Marcel Bozzuffi.

Warner Brothers stood at the forefront of this revolution, almost solely on the back of James Cagney, an actor who made a life out of portraying 'tough guy' Americanised Mafiosi, and creating the archetypal figure that forms in the mind of modern-day audiences when they hear the word 'gangster.' With The Untouchables, Brian De Palma has directed an excellent homage to Cagney's crime classics, synchronising the plot and script of those films with a modern self- reflexive undertone not unlike that used in fellow 80's noir thriller Blade Runner.The film stars Kevin Costner as Federal Agent Elliot Ness and is set in Prohibition-era Chicago. Al Capone (Robert De Niro) rules the streets, supplying illegal alcohol to those who want it and bribing those who don't. Contrary to popular belief, the film's title refers not to the criminals, but the small team Ness assembles to combat this corruption, including ageing cop Jim Malone (Sean Connery, in an Oscar-winning role), accountant Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith) and newbie George Stone (Andy Garcia).As mentioned above, The Untouchables applies a plot formula used an infinite amount of times since the 1930s the confrontation of good versus evil, and how the pursuit of victory impacts each side. In fact, the plot is not the only convention De Palma has adapted from the earliest of crime films. The production crew pulls out all the stops to add authenticity to the setting, from the buildings, to the cars, to the clothes (legend has it De Niro tracked down Al Capone's personal tailor and asked him to design his wardrobe). But the biggest wink to the audience is delivered through the characters and indeed, the script itself.Through the first, say, half hour of The Untouchables, you might find yourself questioning its reputation as a respected classic. Much of the dialogue appears cheesy, and the characters over-the-top in their delivery and general mannerisms.

Connery's imposing presence and husky voice made him an excellent choice for the no-nonsense Malone, but it is arguably De Niro who delivers the best performance.

Finally, the camera is used in often-breathtaking fashion throughout the film. Long tracking shots build suspense, and the camera's involvement in a particular scene involving an assassination was (for me, at least) the turning point from which the film excelled from good to great.

They may have been at turns exciting and funny, but he is one of the few legendary directors whose work can never be said to have shed a tear. And yet, Family Plot is just a little poignant in its context, as this is the last picture Hitch would ever make, and he probably guessed it himself due to his failing health. There is a certain sadness in seeing this old man of classic cinema doing things his way in New Wave Hollywood. He was among the last of his generation still around, and while he had long since made his last masterpiece, Family Plot contains all the cunning craftsmanship that earned its creator the soubriquet Master of Suspense&#x99;.The screenplay for Family Plot is by one of Hitch's old collaborators, Ernest Lehman, who also wrote North by Northwest. It's based on a serious novel by popular English writer Victor Canning, but at the director's behest Lehman spoofed it up into a comedy. You can see why. As a basic plot it's a bit of a by-the-numbers thriller, and there are some dreadfully corny moments like the slowness with which Bruce Dern deduces that one gravestone is newer than the other. The story is so formulaic it becomes silly, so why not acknowledge and exaggerate that? But Family Plot does not descend into outright farce, and is in fact rarely really laugh-out-loud funny. Instead it contains just the right balance between a lightly comical tone and a genuine thriller to be fully enjoyable. The end result has many of the qualities of 1973 hit The Sting, with likable petty con artists getting one over on serious big-time crooks, and all the easygoing lightness of the earlier picture.That leading duo of tricksters are played by Bruce Dern and Barbara Harris. Apparently at one point the roles were to have gone to Al Pacino and Liza Minnelli respectively. Now, while Pacino and Minnelli are two of the most talented stars of their generation, and certainly adept at comedy, there is something about the imperfect competence of Dern and Harris that makes them better for these parts. Dern has this good-natured irritability, and his wonky features make him an appropriately homely hero. Harris too is such an unpretentious player that her switching in and out of demented psychic performance seems natural to her person, and not the hammy bit of scenery-chewing it really is. On top of that the two of them have a really wonderful chemistry that I cannot imagine between Pacino and Minnelli. As the villain of the piece we have William Devane, who appears like a slightly crazier version of Robert Shaw in The Sting. His performance is serenely laid back but with an air of suppressed energy, as if he could explode into maniacal anger at any moment.But ultimately Family plot is a Hitchcock piece, and it is his masterly presence that drives the picture. He may be dealing with the actors, settings and language of a modern generation, but his cinematic design still follows the principles he developed thirty years earlier. It's his ability to lead the audience through the plot visually that has always been his greatest strength. You can see this in the opening scene, where the mid-shots show us Harris's psychic act duping old Mrs Rainbird, while a couple of sly close-ups show us what she is really thinking. In a really clever shot the chandelier in Devane's lair is given prominence, apparently coincidentally, but this pays off a minute later when we are gradually drawn in on it to realise it is the hiding place of the jewel, while the conversation between Devane and Karen Black about the jewel being hidden where everyone could see it continues offscreen. This is Hitch's cheeky nod to the audience &#x96; very deliberately and obviously showing us something whilst we hear a character being contrastingly evasive about it. Hitchcock remains a very influential director and hundreds of youngsters have tried to emulate his style, but by and large they fail to achieve the sense of personality that the Master of Suspense&#x99; puts through the camera. It is the touch of the true storyteller, to be able to step outside the narrative and give us some little aside, a by-the-way moment or a knowing wink, all without breaking the spell of the story.

It is the fact that on some level, you are aware it is following a story, that makes what you are experiencing all the more insane.The story is pretty much a precursor to the Lars Von Trier film Antichrist, the main differences being that in the case of Possession it is not grief over a lost child that is destroying the couple's relationship, and that Possession is the better, if more messed-up piece (seriously!) Mark returns home in the knowledge that there is something wrong with his wife Anna, and it quickly becomes apparent to him that she is unhappy with their marriage and that she has taken a lover. Once past this point, the film appears to become a much larger, extremely metaphorical piece, which goes far beyond these two people's relationship. My impression is that the characters you are watching become political archetypes, dialogue and on screen events often not making any sort of literal sense, but rather begging you to read between the lines. This impression is backed up quite firmly, I believe, by the fact that it all unfolds next to the Berlin Wall, the monstrosity often in frame, if not being shot as a central character at points; the fact that Adjani is clearly playing two roles, and that the lover Anna has hidden away for her private sexual encounters is in fact a monster! Talking of the monster, Carlo Rambaldi, the man responsible for the Alien creatures and E.T, is the person behind this, and he still does not like to talk about this film, apparently.There is some complaint that a lot of what happens between these character seems very stagey and false, but that is now how I saw it. Given my previous impression, I believe that we are being taken up close and personal in this surreal play, often far too close for comfort, as these people scream their conversations hysterically, and we plunge into the madness. The stagey feel comes from the fact it does seem to play out as a theatre production, but we are put right on the stage with them (again, something Von Trier would later visit in his work). It is clearly intentional that everything be surreal and strange, adding to how unnerving the whole thing feels, but the performances are undoubtedly superb. Adjani did, in fact, win an award at Cannes for her performance, despite the film being banned! You need no other explanation as to why, other than watching the acting; to see her give this grotesque, shrill, hyper performance is truly uncomfortable. The fact Sam Neill stands his ground is testament to his prowess and presence.You walk away from Possession completely dumbfounded and unsettled, with an inexplicable desire to watch it again; either that or you will simply despise it.

Okay, so we started off with the disappointing (but far from terrible) The Godfather Part 3, but later that year Martin Scorsese released GoodFellas, which many people consider to be the definitive gangster film. In that same year came Miller's Crossing, and Quentin Tarantino added to the palette with both Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. In 1995, Marty hit back with Casino, redefining the blockbuster genre in a way that wasn't emulated until some twelve years later, when Nolan got his hands on the Batman franchise.Comprising of an all-star cast headed by the incomparable Robert De Niro, Casino tells the story of Sam 'Ace' Rothstein, America's finest bookmaker in the 1970s and 80s, whose knowledge of the industry lures him to Las Vegas. At the behest of the Mafia, he becomes the executive manager of the fictional Tangiers casino. Childhood friend Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) comes along for the ride, and all seems to run smoothly until a desire for women, wealth and the very essence of Vegas sends the gambling empire into a tailspin. Expect nothing less than utter professionalism in the direction department. Scorsese gives the audience an excellent look into the luxury, excess and emotion that defined Las Vegas for so long. The visuals are striking, displaying the bright lights of the city in external scenes, and giving the film a glossy undertone during internal scenes; a highly unconventional technique, but one that reflects the tone perfectly.As with most of Marty's masterpieces, Casino is unique in the way that it dosen't follow a structured plot. Rather, the film is, for lack of a better phrase, a whole bunch of 'things' that happen, and how they impact on (or are caused by) the main characters. In fact, a positive aspect of the movie that isn't recognised by most is just how much influence the characters have on the story. The first half of the film is concerned with how Ace and Nicky run the casino turning over profits, keeping customers happy and dealing with cheaters. The second half deals solely with each character's personal issues, and how they destroyed something so valuable from the inside out. We see how Ace's hustling wife Ginger (Sharon Stone, in a career-best performance) turns two former friends against each other, while slowly killing herself as well. There is no doubt that the events of the second half are on a smaller scale to those of the first, but so much more emphasis is placed on the former because of the magnetism and excellent performance of each actor.Drama is on high supply for the film's entire three-hour run time, but allows for some well- written comedy to complement the pace. For all the excellent younger actors Scorsese has worked with in the past decade, none of them convey the effortless on-screen chemistry of De Niro and Pesci, whether they are joking with each other, or wishing death upon one another. At its simplest, this can be called the ultimate guy's movie. It features shooting, swearing, suits, money, fast cars and even faster women. Delve a little deeper, and you'll appreciate the practically flawless acting, indulgent cinematography and a cautionary tale just as critical of greed and the flaws of human beings as Wall Street or Scarface. I take issue with this film's tagline 'You don't stay at the top forever', because it will take one hell of an effort to knock Casino off this movie-lover's list of top 20 films.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

Diary of a Chambermaid is another of his attacks on the bourgeoisie but what differs it from the rest is its genuine darkness and pessimism. It's a film about fight of the classes, fascism and a satire of the decay of the French society.Set in early 1930's; a new chambermaid, Céléstine (Jeanne Moreau) arrives to the Monteil mansion. Soon she gets to know the bizarre family full of odd characters; Madame Monteil who seems to be more interested in taking care of their family's furniture than her husband, Monsier Monteil who isn't interested in anything but hunting and Madame's father who is a shoe-fetishist.Céléstine is in between of two worlds; the city and the country, the working class and the bourgeoisie. She's not settled in; so she's not part of the country nor the city as she isn't part of the bourgeoisie or the working class. She doesn't really know where she is, she's a very elusive figure; so she is in the move all the time. Each time the camera let's us observe her, she's in the move. But when Céléstine climbs up the ladder of the social hierarchy she stops. She lies in her bed and commands people around her; the snow outside indicates this age of stagnation she has now entered.Diary of a Chambermaid is based on the novel by Octave Mirbeau which was first adapted on screen by Jean Renoir in 1946. The first word of the title 'diary' refers to the protagonist of the story and in the novel everything is seen from Céléstine's perspective - and no thoughts of her can escape from us. But Luis Bunuel didn't want to focus on one perspective, he wanted to show the perspective of Céléstine but also of the strange people living in the mansion.Bunuel's film portrays life in a swamp. He has transformed the bourgeoisie settings, he grew up in Spain, to France brilliantly. Swamp, of course, indicates a state of life; when you're in a swamp there is no way out. You are stuck and cannot move. This refers to the pessimism of Diary of a Chambermaid; there is no hope and the end shows that Luis Bunuel portrays a humankind with no future; the similar storm and clouds in the end, as in the beginning. All the horrors will happen again and again.Diary of a Chambermaid is a film of antitheses. The city and the country, the bourgeoisie and the lower class - as mentioned, woods and the mansion, house animals and the wild animals. The two latter couples refer to the dichotomy of the film. The house symbolizes civilization where people are frigid and mellow, even the animals are under control. On the contrary, the woods symbolize the wild side of man where one's desires and passions run wild, where rules and standards are cut off and, where the rabbits, wild boars and snails are out of control.It's a very clever film - attack on the bourgeoisie, a common subject for Bunuel but he was never as cruel, ruthless and pessimist about it as in Diary of a Chambermaid. Rapes, hypocrisy and disregard are the main elements which characterize the atmosphere of this film portraying a swampy world.

The city and the country, the bourgeoisie and the lower class - as mentioned, woods and the mansion, house animals and the wild animals. The two latter couples refer to the dichotomy of the film. The house symbolizes civilization where people are frigid and mellow, even the animals are under control. On the contrary, the woods symbolize the wild side of man where one's desires and passions run wild, where rules and standards are cut off and, where the rabbits, wild boars and snails are out of control.It's a very clever film - attack on the bourgeoisie, a common subject for Bunuel but he was never as cruel, ruthless and pessimist about it as in Diary of a Chambermaid. Rapes, hypocrisy and disregard are the main elements which characterize the atmosphere of this film portraying a swampy world.

Diary of a Chambermaid is another of his attacks on the bourgeoisie but what differs it from the rest is its genuine darkness and pessimism. It's a film about fight of the classes, fascism and a satire of the decay of the French society.Set in early 1930's; a new chambermaid, Céléstine (Jeanne Moreau) arrives to the Monteil mansion. Soon she gets to know the bizarre family full of odd characters; Madame Monteil who seems to be more interested in taking care of their family's furniture than her husband, Monsier Monteil who isn't interested in anything but hunting and Madame's father who is a shoe-fetishist.Céléstine is in between of two worlds; the city and the country, the working class and the bourgeoisie. She's not settled in; so she's not part of the country nor the city as she isn't part of the bourgeoisie or the working class. She doesn't really know where she is, she's a very elusive figure; so she is in the move all the time. Each time the camera let's us observe her, she's in the move. But when Céléstine climbs up the ladder of the social hierarchy she stops. She lies in her bed and commands people around her; the snow outside indicates this age of stagnation she has now entered.Diary of a Chambermaid is based on the novel by Octave Mirbeau which was first adapted on screen by Jean Renoir in 1946. The first word of the title 'diary' refers to the protagonist of the story and in the novel everything is seen from Céléstine's perspective - and no thoughts of her can escape from us. But Luis Bunuel didn't want to focus on one perspective, he wanted to show the perspective of Céléstine but also of the strange people living in the mansion.Bunuel's film portrays life in a swamp. He has transformed the bourgeoisie settings, he grew up in Spain, to France brilliantly. Swamp, of course, indicates a state of life; when you're in a swamp there is no way out. You are stuck and cannot move. This refers to the pessimism of Diary of a Chambermaid; there is no hope and the end shows that Luis Bunuel portrays a humankind with no future; the similar storm and clouds in the end, as in the beginning. All the horrors will happen again and again.Diary of a Chambermaid is a film of antitheses.

It made me react here.First, I consider myself as neutral as nor American nor Japanese even if I know those two fascinating countries inhabitants a little. And I did not feel the same the Japanese reviewer did. In my sense the film does not mock Japan. It does not show Japan as 'inferior' but as different. And this is all the interest of this film whose purpose in my opinion is to show the opposite mentalities and culture. Both sides are presented. The bad and the good ones.The Bad  Japoneses are showed as ridiculous with red tape and bureaucracy matters, with shy behaviors, weird violence (for occidental people). But Americans too. Those are presented as brutal stupid beasts, for example when Charlie Vincent run after a motorbike without understanding the trap is going into or when Nick Conklin does not manage to restrain himself from knocking everywhere. Or when Nick signs a stupid sheet of paper without distrust. The two Americans are also presented as arrogant as they don't even think that foreigners could speak English .. because they don't imagine it is even possible. Even the American\/Japanese prostitute rejects their arrogance. Also American police is presented as corrupted and messy ... So no one wins here I guess.The good  Japaneses are also presented as good. Cops are straight but cooperative and honor respectful, mainly instructed, efficient. Even if they lack of adaptiveness and are bad inspired to reject the American cops help. The mafia is well presented too. Franckly, they really are scary guys but gain respect with their honor code. Sato is impressive. Here I agree with the Japanese reviewer  The Americans are glorified (music helps ). Nick manages on his own (yet with the help of Mas) to solve a difficult case in a country he obviously even doesn't know. This is clearly the weakness of the film.Yet what I really appreciated was the oppositions between Mas and Nick. Wiseness and honor of Mas, for example when he feels insulted by Nicks thief behavior or when he learns from Nick. Humanity and pugnacity of Nick.I also liked mafia's leader speech with Nick. Here we definitively can't say the film only runs for America, obviously.One regret. We definitively see too little of Japan. Even if the film does much in presenting a country that we mainly bad know in occident, it could have done more. That said, I think this was not the purpose of the director who just wanted to focus on mindsets.Another regret  the ridiculous sounds of the motorbikes especially in the beginning of the film and in the last scene. The actors are all perfect. The soundtrack is really cool. Contrarily to the Japanese reviewer, I appreciated the way the director represents Japan, with subtlety, as Japan is all about. And USA with strength, as USA are all about too, sometimes too much ). If the oppositions between the two countries are exaggerated, it is in the purpose of showing them better and make understand, I guess. This is a 'must-be-watched' film for me. One of the best of Ridley Scott.
