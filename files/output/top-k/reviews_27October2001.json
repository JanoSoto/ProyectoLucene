It really is structured like a dream; we know that there's a point underneath layers and layers of information, but we can't quite get at it. There are certain facts we know to be true*SPOILERS*-a filmmaker named Adam has been forced to cast a woman named Camille in his movie-a woman named Diane Selwyn is dead-Naomi Watts' and Laura Herrings' character(s) know each other and were\/are lovers*END SPOILERS*Everything else is debatable. Dreams don't have a typical 3 act structure, nor does this. Don't sit there trying to make sense of the dream, just admire the skill with which Lynch has crafted his dream world. Anybody can create a place where, say, dogs talk and the sky is upside down and say whoa, this is weird! However, Lynch roots his dream world in real life. All of the various realities we see are perfectly plausible explanations of the truth, and because there is no information that is dismissible, the puzzle becomes richer. This is a great piece of movie making for Lynch fans and for fans of good cinema in general. It's only a head scratcher if you've got an itch, otherwise it's a rather exhilarating, reality bending journey into the sub-concious. Lynch hasn't been this good since season one of Twin Peaks, don't miss out.
