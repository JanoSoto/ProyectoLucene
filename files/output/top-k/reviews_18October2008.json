I did not grow up with it, I did not see it once, get scared, and then love it when I was older, and I did not watch it with any hype or weighted opinion whatsoever. I'm not really a John Carpenter fan. I am a hardcore horror fan who has seen the majority of what the genre has to offer. I am an adult, and I watched this last night, 9\/17\/08. I'm not sure it's possible to find an opinion that is more unbiased than mine when I say The Thing rocked.First and foremost, the reason The Thing works is because it does not bash your over the head with a block of cheese, unlike most classic horror movies. Some of the effects are a bit outdated, despite what the lifetime fans would have you believe, but not so much as to look cheesy. At all. There is very little gore&#151;nothing that the average parent wouldn't let a 8-year-old see&#151;and the gore effects are also outdated, but it doesn't take away from the movie. I just found it downright refreshing to watch a movie that didn't try to kick me in the balls. I've watched so many ultra-gory movies lately, The Thing made me remember what it was like when movies didn't use gore to make the viewer feel like crap, but instead used gore as part of the actual story. It's the perfect movie to watch on a snowy night with your girlfriend\/wife or your kids.The reason The Thing isn't cheesy is because it submerges you in atmosphere and suspense and mystery, then it punches you. The creatures are not generic whatsoever, and some of them are downright weirdly awesome. (Spider-head, anyone?) The plot is pretty generic, if you can even call it a plot at all. Here is one of the greatest movies of all time, and it does something that you wouldn't expect it doesn't really have a plot. No, The Thing is true survival horror. There is nothing here except the desire to survive, and that is the only plot. The opening scene hints that the creatures are aliens, but, really, the movie never says much about their origins other than that. Watching this movie is almost like watching people in an arena try to survive&#151;you don't watch it for the story. What makes The Thing original and different from the other movies like it is the small details, like setting, the creature designs, the characters, the ending, and so on.People who get bored with this movie don't understand suspense. I can understand that, because in the generation that we live in, suspense is dead and buried. Suspense has been replaced with either (1) lame action, or (2) lame dialogue scenes that build characters, even though the characters are pure clich√©s. Suspense is the feeling of I know everyone is going to die . . . that you get before anything happens. I can count the amount of movies that get suspense right on one hand, but The Thing honestly pulls it off. If you're a fan of suspense movies&#151;and no, I don't mean Wolf Creek, I mean like Alien&#151;I do not know why you haven't seen this movie already.Then there is one more thing I need to mention The Thing isn't Alien. It never will be Alien. It is not quite as good as Alien, though it has more action. It is, however, the only movie I would ever mention in the same breath as Alien, because it does come very, very close.Overall This is by far the best Carpenter movie I've seen, and one of the few movies I've ever seen that understands suspense. It's easily one of the best horror movies of all time, and I'm saying that as someone who find most classic horror movies pure cheese. Watch this movie.

It's so much more. It's a celebration of music, of a lifestyle, of a bygone era. It also plays like a Greek tragedy, albeit substantially more fun, but there is no shortage of darkness and tragedy in the film. The shifts in tone are particularly remarkable, as the film veers from its usual dry, sardonic tone into real pathos and examination of the dark side of almost any phenomenal success.I'm not completely nuts. I'm not going to claim that 24 Hour Party People is a visual masterpiece, or a film which achieves more with its characters than most accepted 'masterpieces' of cinema when it comes to depth. I'm not going to argue that it feels as complete an artistic achievement as one of the better films by a cinematic 'master'. Wait, what am I talking about? That's exactly what I'm going to argue. 24 Hour Party People is as perfect as a film can get, not because it achieves the visual perfection of one of Kubrick's finer films, not because it marks a turning point in cinema history, but because it sets out to be exactly what it ends up being- a hilarious, darkly satirical and yet affectionate look at one of the biggest 'scenes' in music history, some of the best bands, and the man behind it all, Tony Wilson. A minor player in his own life story. This is one of the most purely enjoyable films ever made. It all unfolds with a sort of inspired madness. The very first scene shows the charismatic, arrogant, and somewhat self-important Tony Wilson hang-gliding for a television report, then turning to the camera after that's over with and saying You're going to see a lot more of that sort of thing in the film. I don't want to say too much, don't want to spoil it. I'll just say one word 'Icarus'. If you get it, great. If you don't, that's fine too. But you should probably read more. It's not only a terrific line, indicative of the sort of dry wit much of the dialogue achieves, but also telling of what the film is going to be like. J.R. Jones of the Chicago Reader was one of the less infatuated major critics with the film (but still gave it a definitely positive review, which should give you some indication of just how well-received this film was by critics), and labeled Coogan's Wilson a a pedantic narrator, describing his story as having little narrative momentum of its own. I like to think that's sort of the point, and Wilson himself makes a point to mention in the film that it's not a film about him. The highlight of the film, arguably even more than Frank Cottrell Boyce's screenplay, is Steve Coogan as Tony Wilson. As everyone reading this probably knows, Coogan based his famed Alan Partridge character on Tony Wilson's career as a television reporter, so he's really playing a variation on Alan Partridge here. What's amazing about Coogan's performance is that he manages to draw even this Partridge fan into Tony Wilson's world so much that I didn't care about any similarity. It's still a stunning comic performance, and excellent during the darker, more serious scenes in the film as well. I'd go as far as saying that it's one of the best male performances of the decade. The rest of the cast is too large to go through one by one, but everyone is excellent here, some going for a sort of slightly altered impersonation of the real-life person they're playing, some creating their own version. A point of criticism often aimed at 24 Hour Party People is inaccuracy. The film is gleefully inaccurate, and I fail to see how that's a problem. We didn't need a pedantic, touch-on-all-bases film about Factory Records, because Factory Records would never have made such a movie had they ventured into film production. This is exactly the sort of loose-knit and yet tightly-written film that is needed to capture the energy of the music and the movement. Boyce's screenplay goes through dozens of characters, none of which don't feel real, it's got enough pompous and arrogant philosophizing to turn off even the worst pseudo-intellectual, but it makes it work simply because it's got a sort of self-mocking sense of humor. The points Wilson makes by referencing history and philosophy are valid, but it would be at odds with the sort of film this is if they weren't written with the wry wit the rest of the film is, and if they weren't delivered so wonderfully by Coogan. The film is shot on video, and uses a hand-held style which far from inhibiting the film as it arguably does with some other Winterbottom films, just suits it perfectly. That doesn't mean there aren't some scenes which are explosively extravagant visually, because there are, and they are beautiful. 24 Hour Party People feels like a complete artistic achievement. It captures the energy of the music, the feel of it, the basis for the movement so well, but also succeeds at providing a well-told summary of the story of Factory Records, the Hacienda, and Tony Wilson. As far as I'm concerned it's one of the most enjoyable films ever made, and one of the most consistently successful. I don't think there's anything here that falls flat, it's all quite brilliant, from the first scene to the final shot. 10\/10 ","genre":"Biography, Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"18 October 2008","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" It would be unfair to dismiss 24 Hour Party People as a biographical look at Tony Wilson.

This movie contains many good elements including a very wonderful performance by Academy Award-nominee Diane Ladd. About half of the time, this movie kept me entertained in its own unique way and the other half of the time I was bored to tears. Thus, I give it two stars out of four. Half and half. Sounds fair to me.Carnosaur is loosely based on a novel by John Brosnan about a mad scientist (Diane Ladd) who is disgusted by the human race's destruction of the planet and plans to wipe it out with a killer virus while genetically engineering dinosaurs so that they can take over the planet once again.I was really surprised that film critic Gene Siskel, who had given the Oscar-winning masterpiece The Silence of the Lambs (1991) a negative review found this movie appealing and gave it a marginally positive review. But now that I've actually seen the film, I can agree with him part way. I still give it a negative review, but I do see why he might have enjoyed it. First of all, like I mentioned earlier, Diane Ladd plays a terrific villain in this movie. Even though she was given some awfully poor lines to act on, she somehow managed to keep me interested and even a bit frightened whenever she was on the screen. I'll say this; she is a lot more interesting than the dinosaurs in this picture. Perhaps the reason Carnosaur was even made was to beat Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park (1993) to the big screen and make a little cash, which it did despite negative reviews from both critics and audience members. The film was made on a low budget and you can tell by the bad acting (excluding Diane Ladd, of course) and the poor special effects. The dinosaurs are seldom convincing at all. They are portrayed using rubber puppets and even though they are shot at night, they do become revealing at times. Sometimes painfully revealing. I also felt that the amount of blood and gore used in this film was way overdone, but that is typical of films of this grade.And there is also one major plot problem in this movie. If the Diane Ladd character wants to wipe out the human race, why not just create the virus and not even bother with the dinosaurs at all? Why go through all the trouble and risk being caught? Of course, the dinosaurs were thrown in one because of the novel source and two to get people interested in seeing the movie, but still it almost seems as though Carnosaur would have been better, at least more logical, if there were no dinosaurs in it at all. And it also doesn't make any sense that she only breeds carnivorous dinosaurs and no herbivores. There are some strangely appealing elements to Carnosaur, much to my surprise, and there are some ludicrous and unbelievably poor elements, as anticipated. It is just too bad I wasn't surprised more while watching this movie. A few re-writes of the script and a slight ante in the budget would have done it wonders.

By the time the studio neared their heyday (before they start turning real bad), Disney made this hilarious and fast-aced adventure comedy and even took time to parody their own works. THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE is not the best Disney movie, and maybe not even for a long time, but that's alright. It's funny, energetic, colorful and, in some spots, it's actually clever. What more could I ask for? I guess, nothing more. THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE may have not brought out the best Disney can offer, but it still clearly shows their capabilities.One of the best pleasures of GROOVE is the ensemble comedic voice acting. The voice cast, which includes David Spade, Eartha Kitt, Patrick Warburton and John Goodman to list the names at the top-billing, are excellent and never lacking in joy and sharp comedic timing. Their comedic performances are more than enough to sustain adult attention, but not without letting the young 'uns down. If you don't find even one of their hilarious mischief at least amusing then you must have your funny bone ripped out of you body and the pain is excruciating. the entire film may not have been a comedic gold mine, but it comes close to rival any non-animated movie above a G-rating. In fact, I say it might put a few others to shame.Spade lends his outrageous voice talents to the spoiled Emperor Kuzco, who is used to his life of royalty (in Kuzco's term, Everyone is under my command) since birth (in one hilarious scene, Baby Kuzco accidentally beheads his stuffed toy and soon a large number of hands reach out to him, each with a stuffed toy to give away). See, Kuzco wants to destroy a peasant village set upon a scenic hilltop so he can build his summer getaway home (Complete with water slide!). Despite the lead peasant Pacha's (voiced by John Goodman) attempt to halt construction, Kuzco does get everything he wants, right? So he thinks. After being fired by spoiled brat of an emperor, his loyal adviser Yzma (voiced with great presence by Eartha Kitt), which I may describe as a cross between Cruella DeVille and... well, Eartha Kitt, wants to get even with him. While hitting stone head replicas of him doesn't satisfy, Yzma plots instead to poison the emperor. But her plans failed, mainly due to the complete incompetence of her bumbling right-hand man Kronk (the hilarious Patrick Warburton lends his voice). Instead of a dead emperor, they just have one badly turned into a talking llama. Assisted by Pacha, Kuzco (the llama) tries to get back to the palace and change him back to human.True, some jokes falter and the story isn't first-class Disney story-telling, but I wasn't exactly looking for a smart straightforward Disney effort when the first frame appears before my face. The movie had me from the first frame and again, and again, and again later on. One of the main reasons this movie worked for me was that it packs one frame after another with enough juice to make us wait for the other. The movie is one funny moment followed by another, that's both for the young and old audiences. While kids will enjoy the silly humor and energy-packed madness, adults will find the talented voice cast and the smarter humor a real pleasure.

Although I took a fonding of Disney's classic animated films, some of them (PETER PAN comes to mind) are extremely overrated. So far as I've seen, only FANTASIA lives up to the term classic, but then again, I haven't seen them all. But even if I did, I'll always have a space in my list of favorites for 101 DALMATIANS. Not only do I find it one of the very best Disney films, it's also on of the very best talking animal fables ever to hit your theaters.One of the aspects of the film is its villain. With the exception the Evil Stepmother and Maleficent, DALMATIANS' Cruella DeVille (voiced by Betty Lou Gerson) is an outrageous and colorfully written villain, and yes, the mention of her name brings in wonderful memories. But, although Cruella is one of the finest aspects of the film, there are other pleasures to behold. Mainly, the clever portrayal of its talking animals. With clever voice acting but mostly due to much more clever writing, the animal characters here don't just talk for our fondness, they talk with precise and clever speeches. The animal characters are far more intelligent and colorful than its human counterparts, but I guess that's what they meant to do. In fact, sometimes throughout the film, I can almost see a sort of human personality among all of the animals, be it cats, dogs or the dalmatians, one and all.The animation has its flaws, and the energy level drops at a rather low point midway, but the film never failed to cheer me up. Colorful characters, beloved animation and no lack of energy help make this little Disney film a big delight. Now, if your still looking for an apology when I say 101 DALMATIANS is one of the best Disney movies ever, your probably better of not reading this review in the first place.

It features two of my favourite actors - Johns' Cusack and Malkovich. The former gives a particularly deep and touching performance as the struggling puppeteer Craig Shwartz. He's a beautiful man and he captures the audiences imagination and sympathy. He's sensitive and dissatisfied with his life with his rather insensitive (at least to his needs) wife Lotte; played by Cameron Diaz, who is not an actress I've never rated very highly, though she is perfectly competent in this role. It is a film which offers the audience so many possibilities on a number of levels, from Craig's becoming captivated by Maxine a fellow employee at a most peculiar office Craig gets a job in early into the film. Much to his dismay any adulterous ambitions he initially has are rendered hopeless by the fact that Maxine has no interest in him as a suitor - is she MAD? Anyhow, Craig discovers by chance, a concealed hole in the wall of an office in work, which if you progress down this hole you end up inhabiting the the being of John Malkovich. After he convinces an unsurprisingly sceptical Maxine of this, she sees the commercial possibilities charging potential customers for fifteen minutes of John Malkovich. Although she herself never tests out the Malkovich experience, she soon, along with the still desperate for her Craig, to make it a success. Craig's desire for Maxine and his realisation that she does not share his feelings is made all the more acute when, after meeting Lotte for the first times declares to be smitten with her. Poor, desperate Craig, what can he do? The object of his desire is taken with his wife and to make a more complication proposition, wants her when she is John, She tells Lotte, who makes an attempt to embrace. Only as John. Craig is now very probably set never to gain Maxine and also to lose his wife.He is desperate and as a result conspires to deceive Maxine by inhabiting John when she believes Lotte is the one pulling his strings. As an exceptionally gifted puppeteer, Craig manages to utilise his ability to manipulate and does succeed in being Malkovich, and eventually tells Maxine, who is by now pregnant with John\/Lotte's baby, that it has been him all along. And so Craig is John and manages to turn John into a puppeteer. A puppeteer being a puppeteer being a puppeteer! Spectacular. Surely though, something so mind bendingly freaky can't go smoothly. Course not, and eventually Maxine releases it is Lotte simply being Lotte who she wants to be with. In the background of all these events involving the four principal characters, is Dr. Lester, Craigs employer, a 105 year old man, who, along with a select group of friends has no plans to die. THEY want to be John Malkovich too and have no intention of allowing Craig to thwart their plans. They make him agree to surrender his occupation of John by telling him they are holding his wife as security. This is untrue, she is with Dr. Lester and co having managed to escape from the pet chimpanzee's cage Craig had imprisoned her in, but she is there willingly and is even invited to join them in being Malkovich. It all goes at a terrific pace with a number of extraneous plot lines, such as earlier John becoming himself, or rather living his subconscious self during which he is in a smart restaurant in which everyone present is JM, the only words uttered are Malkovich and the only written words are Malkovich, which takes the form of a menu which lists every item as Malkovich. An amusing inclusion in this scene includes two female malkovichs, one of whom sings Malkovich, repeatedly whilst seated on top of a piano. The full horror of this has JM screaming his own name. Unsurprisingly is is thoroughly disturbed by this and once his time as himself is up he ends by threatening Craig with legal action if the portal to his being is not blocked up forever. It's funny but you clearly feel his terror and incomprehension at the situation. He knows when he is not acting independently but has hitherto not understood what was happening. The film concludes happily for everyone other than Craig. He leaves Malkovich, the aged Dr. Lester et al inhabit him and he appears not to be troubled by the situation as is shown in one of the last scenes where he greets an old Charlie Sheen, making his second appearance in the film where he plays a charming cameo role as himself. Lotte and Maxine, even after having taken several potshots and they have John's child to keep them company. She, seemingly, is a future vessel for further life greedy occupants. Brilliant. The very sad aspect in all of this is Craig being abandoned and alone. An essentially good man, he lost control of his feelings and ending up losing control of everything in a desperate attempt to be in control. I think John Cusack's portrayal of Craig is one of his finest roles to date.

I totally respect that. Toho Studio did a great thing making him. But this movie is like a more realistic version of Godzilla. Like they did with the newer Batman movies. So there's nothing to be complaining about.Let's start with the storyline. The Japanese Godzilla movies NEVER had a good storyline. The first one was just Godzilla destroying everything, and the others after that was technically just Godzilla fighting other monsters. It's cheap, and stupid after over 20+ movies. The newer, American one is about normal persons facing this beast, and Godzilla's actual feelings. And you got; you just GOT to admit, that the American Godzilla is WAY better worked on. A computer-generated well-made mutated iguana with the size of at least 20 blue whales, he doesn't breath any fire and he looks so damn cool. The Japanese Godzilla is a guy in a rubber-suit.... that's bad. And yeah, have you seen Godzilla Final Wars from 2004? The scene where the Japanese Godzilla fights and win WAY too easy against the American Godzilla? ........ that's just childish. They made a cheap lazy-made version of the American Godzilla to face the Japanese. First of all, the American Godzilla is actually bigger than the Japanese, so they already made wrong with that part in this short fight. And then, the American Godzilla is at least 10 times faster at running. So this fighting scene is just illogic. Oh, you mean the Japanese should win because he breathes fire? Riiiight.... And the villain is calling him tuna-head................... why?! He doesn't look anything alike a tuna! He looks like a monster! If they mean the fish he is eating in this American movie, it's salmons! Not tunas - SALMONS!!! And if you want to criticize head looks, check the Japanese Godzilla's head. He looks like a cat crossed with a reptile. So, touch√© if so...And the Toho Studio are actually calling the American Godzilla Zilla..... how childish. What's wrong with them - are they jealous or something?! Oh, and don't forget the whining about that Godzilla in this movie is too invulnerable..... it's more like the Japanese Godzilla got the Superman syndrome. He doesn't even get wounded by the army, so... I got to say; I respect the Japanese Godzilla as well. But after hearing a lot of people complaining about the American one, I thought it's payback time.This movie is the best Godzilla movie ever. You just have to be open minded, and not a grouchy Japanese Godzilla fan.... such as the AVGN; as I said before. If you like giant monster movies, this is for sure one of the best ever made.

Deckard is a bounty-hunter who specialises in retiring rogue androids. He is charged with finding four such fugitives, who seem intent on contacting Dr Eldon Tyrell, their designer &#133;There are a handful of movies where I think the filmmaker should be entitled to receive royalties on the style of their film; Blade Runner is one of these select few. You could literally pick almost any TV show or commercial from the last twenty years and they all steal something from Blade Runner; looks, clothes, sets, lighting, makeup. It's an absolute triumph of artistic design - the most interesting-looking science-fiction film ever made - but it's also so much more than that. Its critics accuse it of being all looks and no drama but they've really missed the point; it's also a fantastic story with endlessly fascinating characters and unusual situations. I mean, what other movie ends with the villain saving the hero ? Hampton Fancher and David Peoples' script is a loose but clever adaptation of Philip K. Dick's classic 1968 novel Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep ?, although they stole the title from a more obscure book, The Bladerunner, by Alan E. Nourse. At its core is the concept of the androids' humanity. Deckard tries to rationalise his occupation by referring to them with third person pronouns and cynicism but essentially he's just a killer, and all of the android death scenes are bloody and disturbing. They might not be people, but they live life much more than the rest of the population seem to.

Scott is a genuine, no-apologies, barking-mad genius and this movie is just crammed full of amazing shots - the opening cityscape, the golden Tyrell Building, Deckard's future-noir apartment (which is just about the coolest in any movie), Pris' punk-doll look, the Esper\/photo sequence, Roy in the elevator, Roy with the dove, way too many to mention. Movies can be so much more than just talking heads, and when you see one as good as this, I'll be goddamned if it doesn't convince me that Cinema is an Art after all.

And it is easy to see why a film such as Platoon could not only accomplish that but also go on to be considered one of the best motion pictures of all time. It is a gritty, horrifying, profanity-filled (but in a recommendable way) portrait of the unjustifiable Vietnam War and will continue to live on in the memories of audience members for ages to come.Platoon stars Charlie Sheen in what I think is one of his better performances (it is nice to see a gifted actor like Sheen occasionally stepping away from the dull low-budget comedies he and others like him are often associated with) as Chris, a young recruit who enlists to fight in the Vietnam War, only to find in his experiences it was all a horrible mistake. He becomes part of a platoon of soldiers who are divided between their two sergeants, a violent fighter named Barnes (Tom Berenger) and the more calm and patient Elias (Willem Dafoe). Chris soon discovers that as a newcomer, he is not expected to live very long through the war and as time marches on and killing after killing passes, he begins to believe it too.Aside from Sheen, Berenger, and Dafoe (the last two received Academy Award nominations for their performances in this film) the film stars Forrest Whittaker, Francesco Quinn, and a very young Johnny Depp among other gifted actors. They portray characters who are so wonderfully modeled by Oliver Stone's screenplay and so well fitted into this horrible wartime setting that from start to finish, it is nearly impossible for the audience to decipher which characters are going to be killed off and which, if any, are not. This enhances the atmosphere of the film and makes it seem more like a true story rather than just a motion picture detailing a fictional chapter of a real-life conflict.There is a lot of profanity in Platoon that many viewers will find so much as to even describe the film as anti-American. There is excessive swearing, drugs, a rape scene, and a lot of gritty violence used in Stone's vision to capture the war that he experienced. But I don't see the profanity as part of an anti-American film, I see it as elements of a true work of art and in its own strange way, it works. In other films that use the same profanity (Predator 2 for instance) it becomes offensive, but here it adheres to the allegorical point. And the addition of Samuel Barber's classic music composition Adagio for Strings works out very well in the dramatic, tear-jerking moments.Oliver Stone's Platoon is a masterwork of the fabulous art of motion pictures and I am very thankful to see that it is ranked as one of the best war pictures not just by critics, but audience members as well. It is a thrilling, well-acted film that in some scenes, especially the death of a character whom I will not reveal, even succeeded in bringing tears to my eyes.

Chapter numbers and titles may work well in a novel, but not quite as well in a movie.

","genre":"Comedy"},{"date":"18 October 2008","score":"","review":" What I find fascinating about Frank Serpico as Sidney Lumet's film sees him is his striking metamorphosis through the story. When Serpico is a rookie, he is almost boyish in his grooming, and as time passes and he grows more seasoned, he grows a beard and dons a decidedly liberal look in order to blend in without the look and feel of a cop, which even law- abiding citizens resents. Pacino expounds the value of form, objectivity, activity, and aggression. Peculiarly, like many American heroes, himself and his fulfillment are the leading underlying principles.What is so reassuring about him as a real-life character is that he is man in its purest form physically, emotionally and psychologically. He is most self-assured and unapologetic in attitude and behavior, comfortable in his skin and fearless in his ambitions. Beneath his initial clean-cut appearance lies a hormonally raging animal ever ready to take down the rapist that gives chase early in the film. We are stunned at how vigorously and almost supernaturally he runs after this guy. He nonetheless feels obliged to subdue this bestial nature, hoping to achieve a higher connection. It does not take him long to realize that pure intentions and prurient desire need not be mutually exclusive.The film opens with this dogged philosophical hero flaccid in the backseat of a police car, covered in blood as it races to a hospital with lights and sirens blaring. He has just been shot. The rest of the movie tells the story of Serpico's career up to this moment, starting with him becoming a police officer in 1960. This is not quite necessary, but it is an interesting liberty to take with an oft-overused device to juxtapose the consequences with the origins, because it immediately gives us a feeling of what the film will really be about. He begins his career with very romantic perspective of the line of work he's chosen and believes in non- brutal methods to catch criminals. He also refuses to take part in police corruption, particularly that which involves shaking down and taking payoffs from gambling and drug dealing operations. The fact that he simply cannot be bought gains him the suspicion of his fellow officers all over the majority of the precincts to which he is assigned.Sidney Lumet is a director who captures something crucial in city based dramas surrounding legal and political affairs; with films like 12 Angry Men, Network, and even Dog Day Afternoon to an extent, he shows an excellent grasp of the power plays in civic politics. Lumet's style is very intimate with the script. Resolute in its interpretation of the first police officer not only in the history of the NYPD, but in the history of any police department in the United States, to step forward to report and then testify candidly about pervasive, organized police corruption, the film describes his classic battle to maintain a grasp on his personal life, over the stage in which he declines to skim off the top and illustrates his unusual political vindication at an official investigation into NYPD corruption.Sometimes when I see a film that involves timely political wrongdoing or social disorder, I become frustrated because more often than not, those problems are still relevant years after they are made, sometimes half-centuries after they are made. But a story of city corruption is relevant in any era. One merely has to look at great empires, Las Vegas, organized religious establishment, all sorts of turn-of-the-twentieth-century immigrants, and really the history of any one of the most powerful nations on earth to be aware of how much corruption plays a part in the molding of self-styled cultures and societies. What Serpico reveals is that although this sort of corruption is a way of the world and essentially always has been, it is not inevitably an innate feature of humanity.
