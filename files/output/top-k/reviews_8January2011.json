[{"date":"8 January 2011","score":"","review":" The war on drugs has proved to be a difficult battle. Traffic itself has given us viewers a clear and speculative glimpse of how much is truly lost in this war, who the enemy is, and who truly suffers in the end. Director Steven Soderbergh divides this well made close look into the world of drug trafficking, separating its plot into 3 individual stories, showing the multiple aspects of the war on drugs. The main factors he tries to educate viewers on are the concepts of addiction, widespread corruption, and even the desperation shown by several characters. It all begins with a simple drug bust, turning into a variety of open opportunities for Mexican police officer named Javier Rodriguez (Del Torro), in the eyes of a questionable Military general, using what he's seen to further eliminate more drug cartels, including the real life Tijuana Cartel. You'd think that all the efforts General Salazar is making to eliminate these cartels is noble and cunning, only to work more for his advantage, as well as for those he truly works for, the Juarez Cartel. The film shifts back to the U.S. where Judge Robert Wakefield (Douglas), hits the big time in Washington, earning the title of a Drug Czar, hoping to reduce the flow of drug trafficking, and the consumption of illegal substances. In the eyes of a politician it will be challenging, and even inspiring. But how will it see to the person they truly are at home, when the very enemy they are fighting comes in the form of a loved one? Wakefield's daughter's addiction to multiple lethal drugs bring her father into a new viewed aspect on how challenging the war on drugs really is, entailing the true horrors of waging war on someone who means the world to you. In San Diego, 2 undercover DEA cops, Gordon (Cheadle) and Castro (Ruiz) bust a big time drug dealer, who willingly makes a deal to sell out the big man of his operation, as well as the father of his second child to come from his spoiled and soon to be corruptible wife Helena Ayala (Zeta-Jones). As Carlos Ayala, is dragged out of his home, and placed on trial, Helena's desperation to protect her son, and maintain the wealthy lifestyle she's been accustomed to drive her to the tainted art of her husbands unforgivable business of illegal distribution. All it took was some debt, some threats from their rival groups, and a little push from her husbands lawyer Arnie (Quiad). All these stories put these characters into corners where their moral compasses direct them to make final decisions that influence not only each other, but the general outcome of America's stance on the war on Drugs. Javier faces the difficult decision of whether or not he should side with Salazar as well the very drug distributing devils who make life in Mexico hell, or if he should reveal all that he knows to the DEA, in the exchange that they make a change for the children in his neighborhood. Robert realizes the depth of how vicious a battle they are facing against drugs, seeing the desperate acts of his daughter's addiction to obtain more drugs. Helena folded and decided to stain her soul with the choice of her husbands business and all its requirements, including the will to murder, lie, and further push for the distribution of drugs in America, with more advanced knowledge. As we've seen the war on drugs in America is a war where winning seems impossible, particularly in the methods the politicians, and state and local agencies hoped for. It's not clear if we will win this war, however our efforts proved not in vain, as the actions of few show that many out there have the possibilities to make a difference to win this long battle. Roberts actions to listen and support his daughter are noble enough to prove that despite facing an unwant able enemy, our hope is not lost. Javier's need to help those in need, and throw away his desires to help those without fortune show the desire to change, what the influence drugs and their cartels have created for innocent and easily corruptible people. I especially enjoyed the conclusion to Helena's story, how Gordon in a premeditated act, slips a transmitter well enough to show, that the enemies will at some point face the true hands of Justice. Traffic is more than just a look into the very process of transporting drugs across the border and there. It's also a glimpse of the battle of those for and against drugs, how this conflict affects our country and the people in it. This battle is still going on today, right now, and despite the odds of percentages against us, through our determination to not only cut down the distribution, but help those tainted by drugs is comforting enough for Director Soderbergh to send the message that we can win this war.

The movie Forrest Gump can be considered as one of these movies.it has got some elements of American identity. The story of a man who is intellectually and mentally under grown and underdeveloped but he appears to be appropriate and rightful in the works in his world. He becomes an icon and hits the press all over the country. His dreams turn to reality and this shows that your imaginings will come true if you try hard enough and at the same time if you are well equipped to freshness and honesty. Surprisingly, he visits three presidents, Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon. He receives honors and makes accomplishments in table tennis, shrimp industry, Vietnam War. A simple man from Alabama who travels around the world runs across America and meets political, cultural figures like Mao and John Lenon as well. The amazing point that makes the main character of the film, Forrest Gump, lovable and believable is that he keeps his childhood innocence into maturity probably because he is not very smart; his IQ is 75 below the normal point which is 80. On the other hand he remains as a child in mind and soul even though he is physically grown. This can be drawn in the picture which he shows his wounded buttock to the President Johnson in the White House while he is receiving his Medal of Honor. This is the indication for his simplicity. He firmly believes in three things God, his mother and his lifelong love, Jenny, which remembers her all the time. Although the movie keeps eye on Gump's life career but mainly it is depicting different periods of American history. For example, it shows scenes from racial discrimination, Vietnam War, Kennedy Assassination, Watergate scandal and so on. In some cases it's hard to distinguish clearly what the genre the movie is, whether it is drama, romance or a satire. It can be argued that the director skillfully amalgamated comedy, drama and documentary into each other. Technically speaking, the movie is a flashback and a narrative mode in which the movie starts from showing the viewers that Gump is sitting on a bench waiting for a bus. At the same time, he tells the story of his life to different people waiting for the shuttle bus. His story is the tale of the nation and the country and even generally the world as well. Visually impressive, the makers could successfully have put Gump in scenes with the US presidents. Even they could have made it possible to hear from Kennedy in Footballers' visit at the White House. Due to this technicality and specialty it won the Academy Award for the Best Visual Effects in 1994. The movie is ranked as the 71st of the best motion picture of the all time by (AFI) American Film Institute. Gump's capability to be in the right place at the right time makes him exceptional, too. He saves the lives of the American troops in Vietnam War while he was looking for his intimate friend Buba. Once He ran like a wind into the football field and he made part of his life career as a footballer star by being too fast in the matches. He is the one who calls the police and apprises them the weird condition in the hotel which was the lead to disclose the Watergate scandal that led to the resignation of Nixon. His simplicity and honesty is playing a key role in all these situations. Despite being not normal as the doctor and headmaster tell to Gump' mother in the beginning but he makes a very successful life career which makes him well known and much more generous and giving .The lessons that Gump are given by his mother are very simple but very helpful. One of them is faith and believes in destiny. To do your best but at the same time to keep your faith and be faithful on what destiny brings about to you, to accept it and live with your life. The main message of the movie can be when there is a will, there is a way. And as the British people put forward Honesty is the best policy. These two are as the secret to happiness which Gump finds it in his life. Other than that his life is inspiring for many such as Lt. Dan Taylor and even Jenny who accuses Gump that you don't know what love is but finally backs and returns to the kind but slow-witted man to make her own life much more meaningful and cheerful.

Despite being not normal as the doctor and headmaster tell to Gump' mother in the beginning but he makes a very successful life career which makes him well known and much more generous and giving .The lessons that Gump are given by his mother are very simple but very helpful. One of them is faith and believes in destiny. To do your best but at the same time to keep your faith and be faithful on what destiny brings about to you, to accept it and live with your life. The main message of the movie can be when there is a will, there is a way. And as the British people put forward Honesty is the best policy. These two are as the secret to happiness which Gump finds it in his life. Other than that his life is inspiring for many such as Lt. Dan Taylor and even Jenny who accuses Gump that you don't know what love is but finally backs and returns to the kind but slow-witted man to make her own life much more meaningful and cheerful. She even gave birth to a child and named him Forrest Gump; a new generation but with the old and respected values and beliefs. Forrest Gump's tale and world is ours, too; with too many ebbs and flows; with sorrows and joys; with defeats and victories. But the tool and rule to overcome the difficulties is simple; to be honest and hopeful. He is exceptional mentally but not morally. His morals help him to make the Forrest Gump an icon in the movie and in the real world as well.

(Stanley Kubrick) is best known as none other than The Great (Stanley Kubrick). And whoever dares to object is whether an idiot or ignorant. The thing is this film displays no greatness at all.The narrative could be the only good thing around, since it shows a different character. The lead isn't the idealistic prince charming or the inhuman selfish conman either. He's a fine mix of both, being a real human beyond stereotyping. It chose to use a narrator, which is an old trick to emphasize the satire; towards the human in general this time (dumb to know what he wants, dumb to select the most trivial money, and dumb to lose it along with everything else). Despite being 3 hours it floats, not due to the editing inasmuch as the script's short scenes and the story's intensity. So far, so good, or at least not bad. The problems were else where.I'm sick of praising the cinematography of this film. First off it's not that *massively beautiful*. For instance (Funny Face &#x96; 1957) is. While being internally tepid, some of the outdoor images can make a fair calendar; and that's about it. Although it's an achievement to develop special lenses to allow filming without electric lighting but using the candles' yellow lighting was so stupid at times, making the meeting with the village's girl and the military's café have one atmosphere. I didn't run into something that smart about the long shots of the Lyndon's castle except being repetitive meaningless postcards. It's solely the scene of the fight between the lead and his wife's son, with movable held camera, that drew my attention, as &#x96; finally &#x96; something alive !Then the horror. Oh sorry, I meant the music. The choices of (Kubrick), out of the classic music, reflect a one of a kind BAD taste. Who can stand this strangling bore ? Not me for sure. The tracks are totally dull and unattractive. Evoking the past by its art proves a mighty failure this time. At one point, while the sequence of rescuing the officer from a falling wall, I was crying due to the soundtrack's paralysis&#x85;really !The acting of (Ryan O'Neal) is maybe the film's lowest point. Nothing deep about it. Shockingly this film assures that he isn't a good actor. I couldn't see the dispositions of (Barry Lyndon) through him. I thought that a role such as this needed (Robert Redford), coincidently was having his moment back then, since he's a master in expressing the fires under icy surface. (O'Neal) has the icy surface only ! (Later on I discovered that Redford was the first choice indeed).The rest of the cast did their jobs whether woodenly (Marisa Berenson reminded me of the silent cinema's awful stars; where all the feelings are expressed in one-note expression), or usually with no performance could come close to be called brilliant. Now read what critic (Tim Robey) said  The film makes you realize that the most undervalued aspect of (Kubrick)'s genius could well be his way with actors Ha Ha Haaa ! I ask; why (Kubrick) has to be always genius ? And if he was; then where he ever did wrong ?The way (Kubrick) moves the cast is so primitive and funny sometimes. Why to showcase the thinking of lady Lyndon's son as walking back and forth ? Or Ahh, Barry got to sit in the middle of the must-be-empty restaurant to articulate how deserted he became ! For most of the time I felt how flat, instead of how eloquent. Further, the scenes are mostly one-shot with not much motion in it, which congealed the visual pace into slow-moving paintings (Kubrick wants to embody the pace of the past ??!!). Knowing the way how the cast acted, then I was watching a historical puppet show !Many viewers said this is a boring film. Most of (Kubrick)'s elements did that perfectly. The film resembles what Marisa Berenson looks during it (Ouch !). Apparently the perfectionist, that (Kubrick) was, cared unhealthily for drawing the delicate yellow lighting over the actors' faces to resurrect the time period, more than seeking any sort of interact between us and the shown characters and events. True he wanted the meaning of the story, not the story, but what's interesting in evoking the 18th century's paintings, music, and pace, while lacking the vitality ridiculously ? That produced heavy uninteresting pedantry.The main problem is that the mix wasn't right. The film is compressed between the method of making us meditate, not react (Be philosophical), trying artistically hard to conjure up a very accurate visual and sonic feel of the 18th century as well (Be realistic ?!), plus &#x96; oh my god &#x96; a stiff and dry filmmaking where everyone along with everything is filled up with violent starch or, in less words, the coldness of the Eskimo (Be Kubrick !). The result is meaning and techniques in the front, drama and heat left in the back; namely it isn't an efficient film, rather a refined costume piece wore by a statue, with a very conceited look up its face too. Simply&#x85;Your film is highly embellished Mr. Kubrick, yet spiritless. It's more frigid than Barry Lyndon himself&#x85;incomparably !Imagine; what if this movie, as it is, was written on it that it's directed by another person or a newcomer ?

Now read what critic (Tim Robey) said  The film makes you realize that the most undervalued aspect of (Kubrick)'s genius could well be his way with actors Ha Ha Haaa ! I ask; why (Kubrick) has to be always genius ? And if he was; then where he ever did wrong ?The way (Kubrick) moves the cast is so primitive and funny sometimes. Why to showcase the thinking of lady Lyndon's son as walking back and forth ? Or Ahh, Barry got to sit in the middle of the must-be-empty restaurant to articulate how deserted he became ! For most of the time I felt how flat, instead of how eloquent. Further, the scenes are mostly one-shot with not much motion in it, which congealed the visual pace into slow-moving paintings (Kubrick wants to embody the pace of the past ??!!). Knowing the way how the cast acted, then I was watching a historical puppet show !Many viewers said this is a boring film. Most of (Kubrick)'s elements did that perfectly. The film resembles what Marisa Berenson looks during it (Ouch !). Apparently the perfectionist, that (Kubrick) was, cared unhealthily for drawing the delicate yellow lighting over the actors' faces to resurrect the time period, more than seeking any sort of interact between us and the shown characters and events. True he wanted the meaning of the story, not the story, but what's interesting in evoking the 18th century's paintings, music, and pace, while lacking the vitality ridiculously ? That produced heavy uninteresting pedantry.The main problem is that the mix wasn't right. The film is compressed between the method of making us meditate, not react (Be philosophical), trying artistically hard to conjure up a very accurate visual and sonic feel of the 18th century as well (Be realistic ?!), plus &#x96; oh my god &#x96; a stiff and dry filmmaking where everyone along with everything is filled up with violent starch or, in less words, the coldness of the Eskimo (Be Kubrick !). The result is meaning and techniques in the front, drama and heat left in the back; namely it isn't an efficient film, rather a refined costume piece wore by a statue, with a very conceited look up its face too.

Once free, he seeks to destroy the puzzle cube so he need never return to Hell, but a female reporter is investigating the grisly murders and stands in his way.I do actually manage to get some cheesy entertainment value out of this, but for the wrong reasons. This is not a Hellraiser movie, nor does it feel like one. In all honesty, it feels like a rejected plot straight out of a Nightmare on Elm Street sequel. Pinhead cracking jokes? Come on, I get they were desperate to make this franchise into a hit, but they were doing fine by themselves. Pinhead had already created a legacy with the first two movies, so why the comical route, more money? Well their attempt tanked with a measly 12 million at the box office for there efforts. The gore is certainly fun, but where it comes from it isn't. Some of the cenobites are laughable. One with a hole for a cigarette? One who ejects flying CD's? Bit much in my opinion. The dream sequences are probably the best part of the movie, and there are some solid performances. War scenes I should also give credit too, for looking realistic. Too bad the whole movie is basically a silly excuse for a sequel.Performances. Doug Bradley plays it OTT, and I didn't buy it. He wasn't funny, and just came across as an angry, comical, sadistic buffoon then scary. Give me the real Pinhead over this comedian any day! As Elliot he's very solid. His dream sequences with Farrell were well done, even if his dialog stunk. Kevin Bernhardt plays the sleazy J.P Monroe decently I suppose, but he felt a bit off sometimes. Don't know what it was, but it just felt that way. Also, he smokes in almost every single scene! Terry Farrell provides us with a solid lead. Couple of off moments, but she performed very well for the most part. Her strong-willed performance got her through this in one piece. Ken Carpenter is horrible as the Doc, plain and simple. Paula Marshall is very good as Terri. Her sniveling ways got a bit tiring after a while, but other then that, I enjoyed her performance. Her chemistry with Farrell is also good. Ashley Laurence has a cameo, nothing memorable.Bottom line. For some odd reason, I watch it once every couple of years. Probably because I'm a big fan of Pinhead. I get some amusement out of it, but I cannot in any sense of good conscience state it's a good sequel, because it's very mediocre. The real Pinhead died in number 2. Is it worth a viewing?

If you can stomach the graphic, brutal violence and the constant profanity, then you are in for a great roller-coaster ride. This is classic spectacle cinema, a crowd pleaser writ large for the popcorn-munching masses. There are plenty of thrilling action set pieces to enjoy a fight amidst a maze of conveyor belts holding moving luggage, McClane ejecting from a cargo plane cockpit right before said cockpit is blown to smithereens (a conceit which would find its way into the Bond film 'Goldeneye' five years later), and some hand-to-hand combat upon the wing of a moving 747 in the midst of a ferocious snowstorm.

In The Ninth Gate, however, he accomplishes something rather special--a genuinely unnerving and haunting intellectual thriller, and one of the very few films that treats the occult with intelligence and respect.Inevitably, the comparison to Rosemary's Baby has to be made. Let's start with the source material. Ira Levin's novel is a well-made pot-boiler; Arturo Perez-Reverte's The Club Dumas, on which The Ninth Gate is based (the novel is quite different in certain respects) is a first-rate intellectual thriller, and, frankly, a much superior novel. Rosemary's Baby is more a nightmare of a really, really bad pregnancy than a supernatural film. In addition, it stars two of the most annoying fingernails-on-the-blackboard actresses imaginable--Ruth Gordon and Mia Farrow. It's a chick flick with pretensions.The Ninth Gate is superior in every way. Superficially, it's a detective story with occult content and a Faustian subplot. But how many films deal with the world of rare books-accurately? This film does not insult the viewer's intelligence.The script is well written and literate. Boris Balkan, a book collector obsessed with rare books about the devil, commissions rare book dealer Gregory Corso with an unusual task. Balkan has just obtained one of three copies extant of The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows--a book printed in 1666 and purportedly based on an actual text by the devil himself. (The author was burned at the stake for heresy). Balkan wants to verify the authenticity of his copy by comparing it with the other two. This quest becomes more and more perilous as it becomes evident that some sort of singular significance attachs to variations between the three copies in the nine engravings. Balkan attempts to use the nine engravings to summon Lucifer--and fails. But there is something about the ninth engraving.....The casting is just about perfect--the only actor who somewhat falls below the mark is Emmanuelle Seigner as The Girl--manifestly Satan's minion in this demonic Pilgrim's Progress. A former model, Ms. Seigner is beautiful--but boring. Apparently Polanski directed her to play the role flat--but except for the occasional special effect with her eyes, we really do not feel a demonic presence. Fail of direction, or actress? Probably a bit of both. Johnny Depp does a notable job as Gregory Corso, a book dealer without a conscience; Lena Olin does another turn on her standard over-sexed villain persona as Liana Telfer; Frank Langella is appropriately menacing as Boris Balkan, an arrogant book collector who longs for union with Satan.What makes this film work so well is that overused term atmosphere. There are few films indeed where atmosphere plays so important a role--a just comparison is to another notable supernatural film, one of the very few really frightening ghost stories on film--Robert Wise's The Haunting. In The Ninth Gate, as in The Haunting, the surrounding are critical characters. Corso, Balkan, and other inhabit spaces that are frequently strangely empty of other living beings. The barriers between the world we know and a numinous world of seductive promise and evil threaten to dissolve at any moment. This is a genuinely beautiful film--beautiful to look at and to listen to (the score is also first rate)--beautiful, seductive, and menacing.Many commentators has disliked the ending--and yet it is the only possible one. Corso, having obtained (or has he?) the secret of The Ninth Gate, enters the castle shown in the final engraving, which then dissolves into yellow light. Apotheosis? Transcendence? Damnation? Impossible to say. Anything more definite would be a disappointment. The ending is chilling--in the best way.This is not a film for the literal-minded. There are few comparable films--The Devil Rides Out, for one, and perhaps Dead of Night. I doubt if Polanski has ever done anything better--and the The Ninth Gate is one of the very few films about the supernatural that does not insult the intelligence.

It is a beautiful work of art. I had seen it in a theatre when I was in college, but I never forgot it. The characters and the music are so memorable, and the story is so unique that it was unforgettable. Recently I bought the DVD and when I watched it, I noticed a lot of finer things that I had not noticed in the 1980s. I was not aware that it had been a box office failure or that it had been on cable.What I love about this movie is its simplicity and directness, the subtle things, the lyrical quality, and integrity in making the movie. It was made with a very low budget, but you cannot tell when you see it. The sets and costumes are gorgeous. There are no gimmicks, special effects, CGI. It's all about the story, the characters and the idyllic surroundings the movie was shot in- Mackinac Island, Michigan. I have never been there but now I want to. The location- Grand Hotel appears truly grand. The cinematography captures the beauty and magic of the place very well, and the music is out of this world. Although I am a fan of classical music, and a fan of Rachmaninoff, whenever I heard the Rhapsody on the theme by Paganini, I think of 'Somewhere in time' first, then Rachmaninoff. The score by John Barry has made this movie truly romantic and powerful.This is a story about a young man doing time travel from 1980 to 1912 (and back)to meet a woman whose photograph he is drawn to. The director has cleverly used pastel colors in 1912 and dark\/deep colors in 1980. The use of light is very effective and the 1912 costumes are gorgeous. Jane Seymour as the lead female character is equally gorgeous. She displays the 'soft on the surface, tough inside' Ellise McKenna very well. Her face is very expressive and the main picture\/photograph that is central to the movie is absolutely beautiful, with a Mona Lisa like mystical quality.Christopher Reeve does a marvelous job of portraying the character of the young playwright Richard Collier- persistent, polite, charming, and heartbroken in the end. The last part of the movie is particularly touching, with Reeve expressing his deep hurt upon his loss, without a word, but using only his face, eyes and body to express what he is feeling.Christopher Plummer is splendid as Elise's manager\/mentor. You hate him every time he appears to spoil things between the two lovers. He is powerful and controlling, concerned, worried, but he never becomes 'evil' (though he lies to Elise about what happened to Collier)- that's a tribute to Plummer's great abilities as an actor.Other actors who have smaller roles (the most memorable one is Arthur as a child and as an old man) support the main characters effectively.The antique watch which the old Elise gives Richard in 1972 becomes a key piece of the circle within a circle in this time travel story. Some people dislike the time travel concept, but I find it intellectually stimulating. The watch was not a part of the book the movie is based on, but it definitely adds something extra special to the movie. In spite of the deep emotions in the movie, it never becomes melodramatic or mushy. There is an explanation or everything. Everything is understated in the movie, and the director has maintained that subtle, light quality without compromise.I have seen this movie many times, now that I own the DVD. The special features and the commentary by the director are both excellent because they give a lot of background and point out some finer points about the movie.

","genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"},{"date":"8 January 2011","score":"11 out of 17 people found the following review useful","review":" While a very accomplished film technically, the film suffers from some inconsistent performances from the lead actors leading to a lack of audience involvement with the characters.The story is set ten years after the events in Episode 1, and this affords Lucas the opportunity to make some changes to the characters. Anakin is now 19-20 years old, and he is now a 'rebelling against authority' type character. While in itself not a problem, the decision , for relative newcomer Hayden Christensen to play him as bratty is wrong and leads to the character coming across as unsympathetic , bland, and annoying. Also it seems that Christensen cannot seem to get a clear view of the character's trajectory within the story. As a result, his performance is uneven. In some scenes he is fine (primarily on the scenes set on Tatooine), but his performance seems unsubtle and broad,particularly when in more intimate romantic scenes with Natalie Portman. The decision for the Padme character to play a senator is a much better one, and in that regard Portman's performance is much better this time around and draws an appropriate parallel with Carrie Fisher from the original trilogy. She comes off the much stronger of the two performances when up against Christensen. Unfortunately she is saddled with having to act in a very formal and constrained way, with overtly theatrical and clichéd dialogue that is similar to that of films from the 1930s and 1940s, though in some scenes Portman is clearly trying to bring a more natural take to her character. The decision to move away from the naturalistic acting style on the original trilogy was, in my view a major mistake and alienates an older audience from getting emotionally and viscerally involved in the film. Ewan McGregor's performance this time is less constrained than Episode I, and his character is more central to the story. While not as charismatic as Neeson's performance in Episode 1 it is nevertheless solid. Samuel Jackson has fun effectively playing Jedi Master Samuel Jackson, in a more important and involving role. Temuera Morrison is actually pretty good in a small part as bounty hunter Jango Fett. However, the most impressive human performances are of in two supporting roles, with veteran actor Christopher Lee as Count Dooku, and Australian actor Jack Thompson as Cliegg Lars. It is a relief that Jar Jar Binks character is very much in the background, albeit some of his bungling antics seem to have been transferred to C3P0. Like episode 1, the best performances are digital characters. Andy Secombe is great as Watto again, albeit in a smaller role. However the best performance overall, is Frank Oz , in collaboration with Rob Coleman's ILM animation team in recreating Yoda, now as an entirely digital character. The character is well embedded in the story. His anxiety of what is happening to the galaxy around him is conveyed well, as is the character's growing frustration with not being able to accurate assess who or what is behind the collapsing of the republic. His character's insight in the heat of battle makes him part of the films exciting climax, and a confrontation with Count Dooku, while thrilling, is far too brief. If there is a flaw, is that Yoda looks a bit cartoony at the beginning of the film, though his character seems to become more photo-realistic as the story goes along.In fact, while the visual effects are generally excellent, lead by Rob Coleman, Pablo Helman, John Knoll and Ben Snow, there are nevertheless some problems. The digital work in some scenes in my view, goes too far, with sets and whole environments created in the computer when a better balance of live action, models, well designed sets and real locations work best. Not surprisingly, some of the Naboo scenes in this film work better because of the balance between real locations (shot in Australia & Italy) and, as per Episode 1, the segment of the film set on Tatooine (shot in Tunisia), while shorter this time around feels more involving because the high quality visual fx, meshing with real locations feels stronger.

Anakin is now 19-20 years old, and he is now a 'rebelling against authority' type character. While in itself not a problem, the decision , for relative newcomer Hayden Christensen to play him as bratty is wrong and leads to the character coming across as unsympathetic , bland, and annoying. Also it seems that Christensen cannot seem to get a clear view of the character's trajectory within the story. As a result, his performance is uneven. In some scenes he is fine (primarily on the scenes set on Tatooine), but his performance seems unsubtle and broad,particularly when in more intimate romantic scenes with Natalie Portman. The decision for the Padme character to play a senator is a much better one, and in that regard Portman's performance is much better this time around and draws an appropriate parallel with Carrie Fisher from the original trilogy. She comes off the much stronger of the two performances when up against Christensen. Unfortunately she is saddled with having to act in a very formal and constrained way, with overtly theatrical and clichéd dialogue that is similar to that of films from the 1930s and 1940s, though in some scenes Portman is clearly trying to bring a more natural take to her character. The decision to move away from the naturalistic acting style on the original trilogy was, in my view a major mistake and alienates an older audience from getting emotionally and viscerally involved in the film. Ewan McGregor's performance this time is less constrained than Episode I, and his character is more central to the story. While not as charismatic as Neeson's performance in Episode 1 it is nevertheless solid. Samuel Jackson has fun effectively playing Jedi Master Samuel Jackson, in a more important and involving role. Temuera Morrison is actually pretty good in a small part as bounty hunter Jango Fett. However, the most impressive human performances are of in two supporting roles, with veteran actor Christopher Lee as Count Dooku, and Australian actor Jack Thompson as Cliegg Lars. It is a relief that Jar Jar Binks character is very much in the background, albeit some of his bungling antics seem to have been transferred to C3P0. Like episode 1, the best performances are digital characters. Andy Secombe is great as Watto again, albeit in a smaller role. However the best performance overall, is Frank Oz , in collaboration with Rob Coleman's ILM animation team in recreating Yoda, now as an entirely digital character. The character is well embedded in the story. His anxiety of what is happening to the galaxy around him is conveyed well, as is the character's growing frustration with not being able to accurate assess who or what is behind the collapsing of the republic. His character's insight in the heat of battle makes him part of the films exciting climax, and a confrontation with Count Dooku, while thrilling, is far too brief. If there is a flaw, is that Yoda looks a bit cartoony at the beginning of the film, though his character seems to become more photo-realistic as the story goes along.In fact, while the visual effects are generally excellent, lead by Rob Coleman, Pablo Helman, John Knoll and Ben Snow, there are nevertheless some problems. The digital work in some scenes in my view, goes too far, with sets and whole environments created in the computer when a better balance of live action, models, well designed sets and real locations work best. Not surprisingly, some of the Naboo scenes in this film work better because of the balance between real locations (shot in Australia & Italy) and, as per Episode 1, the segment of the film set on Tatooine (shot in Tunisia), while shorter this time around feels more involving because the high quality visual fx, meshing with real locations feels stronger.

One word Borg. The Borg were one of my favorite adversaries from the Next Generation television series (second only to Q, who sadly will probably never be seen in a TREK film). Their unified consciousness and technological superiority made them nearly unstoppable and there is something inherently creepy about a race of faceless drones who only seek to accomplish their one task assimilation of all cultures. Their creepiness is put into full effect here with fantastically updated makeup effects enhancing their seemingly undead, mechanical appearance. Jonathan Frakes (Commander William Riker as well as first-time feature director) does a great job and seems to take cues from movies like ALIEN as Picard and his crew hunt through the Borg-ified Enterprise. It's got a definite horror vibe for the Borg portion of the plot and it's supported with the freaky (albeit sexy) performance of Alice Krige as the Borg Queen. She oozes confidence and sexuality as she attempts to seduce Data (Brent Spiner...yes, she's seducing the android...) and convince him to join her as an equal.While the Borg invasion of the Enterprise is my favorite portion of the movie, there is still an entertaining secondary story playing out on Earth's surface (Montana, to be precise) where Riker and his away team assist soon-to-be-famous Zefram Cochrane in repairing his warp ship and continuing to make first contact with the Vulcans. James Cromwell is awesome as Cochrane and we discover that history's heroes aren't always what we expect. He's a belligerent alcoholic who created the warp ship for his own greedy desires and he's not too keen on learning that he's practically worshiped centuries into the future. There's a great comedy moment in the film where Cochrane has gotten Counselor Troi (Marina Sirtis, looking better than ever) drunk on tequila and she unloads on Riker how difficult it is to interact with such a primitive culture. On the topic of comedy in the film, I'm happy to report that Data's toned back on his emotion hijinks a lot and, while he still has the emotion chip he installed in GENERATIONS, he's no longer singing to computers and talking to tricorders. Spiner is so much better in this film, which is good considering he's a major player in the Borg plot and gets plenty of screen time. It's also great to see Patrick Stewart letting loose with his angry side as he goes nuts on the Borg, driven by revenge and unable to cope with the fact that he might lose the Enterprise to them.Of all the pre-Abrams TREK films, this is the most approachable from those who aren't necessarily die-hard fans. It doesn't shove techno-babble down your throat and it gives you enough information that even those new to the series will follow what's going on.

She oozes confidence and sexuality as she attempts to seduce Data (Brent Spiner...yes, she's seducing the android...) and convince him to join her as an equal.While the Borg invasion of the Enterprise is my favorite portion of the movie, there is still an entertaining secondary story playing out on Earth's surface (Montana, to be precise) where Riker and his away team assist soon-to-be-famous Zefram Cochrane in repairing his warp ship and continuing to make first contact with the Vulcans. James Cromwell is awesome as Cochrane and we discover that history's heroes aren't always what we expect. He's a belligerent alcoholic who created the warp ship for his own greedy desires and he's not too keen on learning that he's practically worshiped centuries into the future. There's a great comedy moment in the film where Cochrane has gotten Counselor Troi (Marina Sirtis, looking better than ever) drunk on tequila and she unloads on Riker how difficult it is to interact with such a primitive culture. On the topic of comedy in the film, I'm happy to report that Data's toned back on his emotion hijinks a lot and, while he still has the emotion chip he installed in GENERATIONS, he's no longer singing to computers and talking to tricorders. Spiner is so much better in this film, which is good considering he's a major player in the Borg plot and gets plenty of screen time. It's also great to see Patrick Stewart letting loose with his angry side as he goes nuts on the Borg, driven by revenge and unable to cope with the fact that he might lose the Enterprise to them.Of all the pre-Abrams TREK films, this is the most approachable from those who aren't necessarily die-hard fans. It doesn't shove techno-babble down your throat and it gives you enough information that even those new to the series will follow what's going on. It's exciting, suspenseful, and at times funny; I can't think of a single moment where I found myself bored with the film. It's definitely the best Next Generation adventure and it's a great into film to those who want a taste of the STAR TREK series.

People are over analyzing and unhappy with it's unconventional open ending. The Underneath, is a kind of film that separates the popcorn entertainment crowd from the serious and studied film enthusiasts. A story does not always need to have a neat and tidy ending, wrapping all plot points up, to be good. This is an art film, about character, circumstance and mood, not a popcorn entertainment movie for the masses.A charming drifter with a gambling problem returns to what he feels is home, for the occasion of his mother's second wedding and attempts to reunite with an old girlfriend. He becomes involved in a love triangle, then a crime, to help rescue his old girlfriend from a seemingly bad new marriage. The film is about a present day armored truck robbery and told entirely in flashback all the people and circumstances that lead up to it. Daniel Fuchs and director Soderbough, under the ghost writer name (Sam Lowry), wrote the screenplay to the film. It's a well observed, insightful character and relationship study, of people mixing together in bad circumstances and the inevitable and inescapable outcome that results.This is very much a director and writers film. Both are very good. Director Soderbergh, Sex, Lies and Videotape, 1989, is well in command most of the time, effectively setting up and executing scenes of mood and uncertainty. Creative cinematography, involving unusual camera angles, framing and color are frequently used in the film, for a film noir (mystery) look.The sequence in the hospital near the end is especially effective, creating a sense of fear, worry, uncertainty and dread. The most interesting and engaging aspect of the film is, the audience is never certain who can be trusted and for how long, in this complex web of human desire and fear.I haven't seen this film since it was first released theatrically in 1995. My favorable impression still holds after a long delayed second viewing.

Unlike a number of the others, he didn't direct this one, but he still wrote it, and the starring role was assumed by Molly Ringwald, who appeared in more than one of Hughes' previous films. Having seen a bunch of other Hughes teen films and been overall impressed with each of them, and knowing that this one was fairly well-liked even if it's not the most popular of the bunch, I figured this would be a pretty good piece of its type. However, when I finally watched Pretty in Pink about 25 years after its theatrical release (it came out over half a year before I was born), I was disappointed to find that it wasn't even average in my book! Andie Walsh is a working class high school senior who lives with her single father, Jack. Her mother abandoned the two of them several years ago, which is something Jack hasn't gotten over. Andie goes to a school where she is looked down on and mistreated by rich snobs, so her school life isn't easy. She is friends with a student named Phil Duckie Dale and an older woman named Iona, the manager at the record store where Andie works. Duckie has a crush on Andie, which means he wants to be more than friends with her, but his way of trying to show it annoys her, and she finds herself falling in love with another guy named Blane McDonough. Blane is one of the many wealthy students at her school, but is far more sensitive than the other ones she knows, and it turns out he is in love with her as well. The two of them begin dating, much to Duckie's dismay. Blane's rich, snobbish friends also don't approve of this relationship.The beginning of this 1986 dramedy, showing Andie's life at home with her father, is far from an amazing start, but it shows that the movie could go somewhere. Moving to the character's school life, I would say it gets slightly more intriguing here, introducing the rich students who give Andie a hard time, and the impregnation offer and reaction that follows certainly made me laugh. However, the film gradually proves to be not so good. The romance can be memorably cheesy, with the first scene showing Andie falling in love with Blane, and then the computer lab scene. I was not too impressed with Andrew McCarthy's performance as Blane, nor was I with Annie Potts as Iona, but neither of them is as bad as Jon Cryer as Duckie. This character is clearly supposed to provide a lot of laughs, and he sometimes amused me doing things such as setting off the alarm at the record store, but his rants are generally not funny, and because of them, the character can sure be annoying! Watching Andie's troubles, including the rich snobs she faces, did not usually grab me, and the ending of the movie is a little abrupt.I've seen Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club, Weird Science, and Ferris Bueller's Day Off, all of which I've found to be good high school movies from the renowned John Hughes. For that reason, one might say I should like Pretty in Pink as well, but I don't! I found this romantic teen dramedy to be weak in more than one department, even if it has received far more praise than criticism in the past 25 years. It came out earlier the same year as Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and sure pales in comparison to that significantly more popular effort. Apparently, Anthony Michael Hall turned down roles in both of these 1986 films to avoid being typecast, and I certainly don't blame him for that, but the role he was offered in Pretty in Pink was Duckie. No offense to Jon Cryer, but Hall just might have been less annoying in this role, and the character could have been less of a problem. Most Hughes fans might like this movie, written by him and directed by Howard Deutch, but I can't imagine myself ever quite getting it.
