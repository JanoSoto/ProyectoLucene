Then I went to go see it.Was it funny? Of course. Was it good? Definitely. Did it match up to the first? In my opinion, no. Now this was a very tough call. Being a huge fan of the first, I was willing to watch anything and call it good so long as it had Jim, Jim's Dad, Nadia, Finch, Vicky, Stifler, et al in it. I trusted the movie to deliver... and for the most part, it did... but something was missing.... Sort of like ordering Chinese food, and they forget the fortune cookies. The meal isn't ruined without the cookies, but when you're done, you expect that special dessert (no pun intended) only to be left with a little pang of 'something's missing.'Overall, I did enjoy it. *(Now for you loyal readers, this does contain a few MINOR SPOILS, so if you are all picky about this sort of thing, don't read on.)*First, I really loved having the whole cast back. The way everyone plays off of each other makes American Pie 1 & 2. No one could play Jim's dad like Eugene Levy. His comic timing is impeccable No one can utter the words 'masturbation' and 'penis' like he can. He honestly makes being uncool cool. From the phone sex romp to the 'Let's give it up for Petey!', the comedy was original and humorous. (Even though nothing could compare to Finch and Stifler's Mom's first meeting) However, I felt that it was a bit forced. The fluidity of the first movie made it flow in such a way that the 'funny moments' seemed to blur together. In this one, you can clearly see where someone sat down with a marker and wrote Serious, Serious, Funny, Heartwarming, Funny...etc. And even though the storyline is original, you can still tell the formula that was used. The opening begins with an embarrassing moment. Gross-out party scene. Cut to the middle which results in another very embarrassing scene that involves Jim's Dad. Conflict, Conflict. Realization, Promise to the Future, Kiss and Make up, Sleep with the Loser from the Pizza Hut commercial, Smile Smile, Moral Message, The End. Of course this formula works, don't get me wrong... but the simple fact that the first one had was fresh made me enjoy it more.That's all I can legitimately complain about, believe it or not. However, I did have a beef with a the ending. Jessica and Jim. Nadia and Sherminator. Kev and Vicky. The first one was funny because Jessica up and left with that whole surprise factor. Now they're together? I'll take the 'Flute' line and Say my name bitch! over that. What about Nadia?! You blew your load TWICE, and now you completely blow it with her so much that she must go through what a grapefruit experienced? I understand Nadia's lover was supposed to be comedy, but it just made me want to smack Jim. Finally, Vicky and Kev. Get together for crying out loud!!!!!!!!! I was hoping throughout the entire movie that they'd realize how perfect they are for each other. Nope. Sorry, buh-bye. I understand times change, and people do, and that friends are forever, but come on - movie's are NOT SUPPOSED to be real... just appease me! They were so perfect together.... oh well....

I did manage to dislike a few things Van Dien was too young (but he was good in the role), Devon Odessa was simply horrible, and some of the camera tricks (the childhood flashes and night vision scenes) were annoying. Yet this movie was startlingly wonderful. I was shocked by how into this thing I was. The rest of the acting was good (especially Michael York and Michael Ironside), the story was compelling, and the effects were very good, especially considering that this movie's budget wasn't very large. When I saw public opinion, I was shocked again. Everyone seems to hate it. Some people complain about acting, direction, and similar things. Those are all right differences of opinions that everyone doesn't have to agree with. After all, I thought Three Kings was a vile hunk of trash, but I don't expect others to hate it. However, when I see people spouting out nonsense about inaccuracy, I lose my patience. The Bible has various interpretations, and no book has more of a variance than Revelations. This is because Revelations HASN'T HAPPENED YET. How can anyone say They did this event wrong when one doesn't know how the event is really going to take place? If you use that kind of thinking, how can you enjoy any futuristic science fiction movie? Well, 2001 A Space Odyssey is bad because it is inaccurate. Here it is 2001 and it hasn't happened yet. What a bad movie. That movie, like this one, is speculative fiction and shouldn't be expected to follow things to the letter. You don't have to believe it. I liked End of Days, Stigmata, and The Seventh Sign but I don't believe the world will see these events. I had a history professor that thought Braveheart was the worst movie ever made because of the historical blunders. It is a slightly valid claim, seeing as how we are dealing with history and past events. Still, that is no reason to trash Braveheart. And it didn't stop it from becoming Best Picture of the Year. The Omega Code should be treated no differently. Just because it has a Christian point of view is no reason to reach into thin air to pull out poor criticism and cynicism. I know because I was trying to do it myself; I was wrong to try. Give this movie a chance. Zantara's score 9 out of 10.

I had a history professor that thought Braveheart was the worst movie ever made because of the historical blunders. It is a slightly valid claim, seeing as how we are dealing with history and past events. Still, that is no reason to trash Braveheart. And it didn't stop it from becoming Best Picture of the Year. The Omega Code should be treated no differently. Just because it has a Christian point of view is no reason to reach into thin air to pull out poor criticism and cynicism. I know because I was trying to do it myself; I was wrong to try. Give this movie a chance. Zantara's score 9 out of 10.

First when I watched the movie, then when I read only a fifth of the comments made here. I went into this movie thinking it would be mediocre at best, especially since it starred Casper Van Dien. I did manage to dislike a few things Van Dien was too young (but he was good in the role), Devon Odessa was simply horrible, and some of the camera tricks (the childhood flashes and night vision scenes) were annoying. Yet this movie was startlingly wonderful. I was shocked by how into this thing I was. The rest of the acting was good (especially Michael York and Michael Ironside), the story was compelling, and the effects were very good, especially considering that this movie's budget wasn't very large. When I saw public opinion, I was shocked again. Everyone seems to hate it. Some people complain about acting, direction, and similar things. Those are all right differences of opinions that everyone doesn't have to agree with. After all, I thought Three Kings was a vile hunk of trash, but I don't expect others to hate it. However, when I see people spouting out nonsense about inaccuracy, I lose my patience. The Bible has various interpretations, and no book has more of a variance than Revelations. This is because Revelations HASN'T HAPPENED YET. How can anyone say They did this event wrong when one doesn't know how the event is really going to take place? If you use that kind of thinking, how can you enjoy any futuristic science fiction movie? Well, 2001 A Space Odyssey is bad because it is inaccurate. Here it is 2001 and it hasn't happened yet. What a bad movie. That movie, like this one, is speculative fiction and shouldn't be expected to follow things to the letter. You don't have to believe it.

Warrant-Officer Paul Brennan (John Travolta) is given the job of finding the perpetrator and during the investigation he meets resentment and opposition on all sides.  There are some tense moments as the double life of the general's daughter is revealed.  I'm not a behavioural scientist, far from it, but I do think that the general's daughter reacted in a very extreme way following a previous rape by soldiers during army manoeuvres.  Her father makes light of the matter for fear of bringing the army and his own important position into disrepute.  The daughter's psychological reaction is such that she will not let the matter rest.  If you are able to accept the daughter's behaviour within the army and her extreme reaction to the pack-rape. you will probably enjoy the investigation as it unfolds.  It appears that she has had multiple relationships around the college and each soldier in turn becomes a suspect.  I found the story with its exaggerations a bit much to take.  For example, the secret downstairs room fitted out with video camera and sadistic and masochistic paraphernalia.  While such might make for titillating drama, I found it highly unlikely on the army premises.  In one of the final scenes there was a conveniently placed landmine which detonated and quickly removed one of the suspects. Again great drama, but It's pushing things too far.

Well, that's what I thought when I first saw it. But after that, it was kind of dull. Plus, everyone goes on and on about it the great fighting scenes, the awesome special effects, the original and deep idea of reality not being reality. It wasn't really that great. First, it was NOT as unique as everybody says. The idea of this not being reality has been approached in several other movies and shows, including eXistenZ (a great movie),  an episode of Star Trek The Next Generation (and a few other Trek episodes), and even Red Dwarf (a British sci-fi comedy show). I'm sure it's been used in countless other things before as well. The fight scenes and special effects weren't as good as they could have been, either. Wow, they can fight in slow motion. They can do whatever their minds can consider, right, especially Neo? Why not just think the enemy dead? Why dodge bullets when you could make them cease to exist?

There's Star Wars, of course, but for someone like me who wants space dogfight action, it's a little outdated.  There's Star Trek, but I hate Star Trek like I hate Barbara Steisand (First Contact wasn't that bad though).  The first trailer of Starship Troopers made me believe it was a war-in-space movie.  I was about to wet my pants in happiness.  Then I saw another trailer and it turned out we fight space bugs on a planet.  Eh, it's not as good as space, but giant alien bugs getting blown to peices is still a sound idea!  I was pumped for this movie, let me tell you.  I may be a big, serious film guy, but I'm also a guy, and a movie about blowing away space bugs sounded like a no-lose situation.Well, the movie gets some points for its action.  This movie has brilliant special effects and puts them to good use (yes you can have good special effects and do nothing with them; remember Episode 1?).  The fighting is fun and intense.  So, yeah, I like that.  Also there is some nudity (but not involving Denise Richards, damn it).Okay, besides all of that, the movie reeks.  Everyone I have ever met liked this movie because of the bug action, but they all, ALL have admitted the movie sucked anyway.  Well, it does.  First off, you couldn't cast worst people to play these bad characters.  Denise Richards is hot, this is true, and it is also true that she wasn't that bad in Wild Things (mainly because she played an annoying, rich, yuppie, white girl which is easy for an annoying, rich, yuppie, white girl).  But, she can't act, AT ALL.  Casper Van Dein (I don't feel like checking the spelling, shoot me) is one of the worse actors I have ever seen.  He looks like somebody you would see in the military, so he looks his part.  But he acts like, well, like a soap opera actor.  And the other people, well, they all suck too.  Actually, Michael Ironside is pretty cool, but other than that, they all suck.Now the plot sucks, but that should be no surprise to anyone.  I knew the plot would suck the moment I heard of this movie.  You don't go to see movies like this because of plot.  But some plot points are just plain insulting.  For example, the main character dies in battle.  WAIT, I didn't spoil anything, because the movie isn't over yet due to the fact THEY BRING HIM BACK TO LIFE.  No, they don't treat his wounds or anything, he really DIES and they BRING HIM BACK.  Maybe I didn't catch that scene right or something, but I swear I think that's how they explained it.  Oh, and don't even get me started on the brain bug thing...  It looks like a crawling anus.  No joke.There are also these scenes which make fun of army recruitment commercials.  If you want to know what I mean, do you remember the fake commercials in Robocop (directed by the same guy, Paul Verhoven)?  Well, they're a lot like that.  Some of them are funny (like when they feed a cow to a bug soldier), but some come off as just plain distracting.So, I think my mission of pointing out the movie is bad is accomplished, but is the movie good in a fun way?  Well, it kind of is.  The biggest problem facing this movie (other than the odd assortment of really bad actors; really, I want to shoot who ever is responsible for this casting job) would have to be that the movie has too many human scenes.  Normally, character development is good, and I feel like I'm committing the biggest movie-sin of all time in saying this, but there is too much development in this movie.  WE WANT BUGS.  Plain and simple.  People don't go to movies advertised like this for anything else.  In fact, we never even get to the bugs until about half way through the damn movie!  This is an injustice.  Oh well.  The training part is pretty funny, as with all movies with training scene.In conclusion, this movie is horrible.  But is it fun?  I have concluded, yeah, for now.  At some point, another director will come along and make a better space bug movie that will EASILY replace this one.  But until then, this will satisfy my male urge for guns, death, and giant space bugs exploding.RatingsOn a serious, film perspective 2\/10On a fun, dumb movie perspective 6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"13 August 2001","score":"","review":"  There are not enough war-in-space movies.

So, yeah, I like that.  Also there is some nudity (but not involving Denise Richards, damn it).Okay, besides all of that, the movie reeks.  Everyone I have ever met liked this movie because of the bug action, but they all, ALL have admitted the movie sucked anyway.  Well, it does.  First off, you couldn't cast worst people to play these bad characters.  Denise Richards is hot, this is true, and it is also true that she wasn't that bad in Wild Things (mainly because she played an annoying, rich, yuppie, white girl which is easy for an annoying, rich, yuppie, white girl).  But, she can't act, AT ALL.  Casper Van Dein (I don't feel like checking the spelling, shoot me) is one of the worse actors I have ever seen.  He looks like somebody you would see in the military, so he looks his part.  But he acts like, well, like a soap opera actor.  And the other people, well, they all suck too.  Actually, Michael Ironside is pretty cool, but other than that, they all suck.Now the plot sucks, but that should be no surprise to anyone.  I knew the plot would suck the moment I heard of this movie.  You don't go to see movies like this because of plot.  But some plot points are just plain insulting.  For example, the main character dies in battle.  WAIT, I didn't spoil anything, because the movie isn't over yet due to the fact THEY BRING HIM BACK TO LIFE.  No, they don't treat his wounds or anything, he really DIES and they BRING HIM BACK.  Maybe I didn't catch that scene right or something, but I swear I think that's how they explained it.  Oh, and don't even get me started on the brain bug thing...  It looks like a crawling anus.  No joke.There are also these scenes which make fun of army recruitment commercials.  If you want to know what I mean, do you remember the fake commercials in Robocop (directed by the same guy, Paul Verhoven)?  Well, they're a lot like that.  Some of them are funny (like when they feed a cow to a bug soldier), but some come off as just plain distracting.So, I think my mission of pointing out the movie is bad is accomplished, but is the movie good in a fun way?  Well, it kind of is.  The biggest problem facing this movie (other than the odd assortment of really bad actors; really, I want to shoot who ever is responsible for this casting job) would have to be that the movie has too many human scenes.  Normally, character development is good, and I feel like I'm committing the biggest movie-sin of all time in saying this, but there is too much development in this movie.  WE WANT BUGS.  Plain and simple.  People don't go to movies advertised like this for anything else.  In fact, we never even get to the bugs until about half way through the damn movie!  This is an injustice.  Oh well.  The training part is pretty funny, as with all movies with training scene.In conclusion, this movie is horrible.  But is it fun?  I have concluded, yeah, for now.  At some point, another director will come along and make a better space bug movie that will EASILY replace this one.  But until then, this will satisfy my male urge for guns, death, and giant space bugs exploding.RatingsOn a serious, film perspective 2\/10On a fun, dumb movie perspective 6\/10 ","genre":"Action, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"13 August 2001","score":"","review":"  There are not enough war-in-space movies.  There's Star Wars, of course, but for someone like me who wants space dogfight action, it's a little outdated.  There's Star Trek, but I hate Star Trek like I hate Barbara Steisand (First Contact wasn't that bad though).  The first trailer of Starship Troopers made me believe it was a war-in-space movie.  I was about to wet my pants in happiness.  Then I saw another trailer and it turned out we fight space bugs on a planet.  Eh, it's not as good as space, but giant alien bugs getting blown to peices is still a sound idea!  I was pumped for this movie, let me tell you.

The serious scenes are certainly better acted and just generally better for the most part. Everyone is back, even the bit characters such as the MILF guys and the Shermanator.Some have commented on parts of this movie being homophobic, which is pretty ridiclous as what is depicted in the movie is what the vast majority of straight college-aged kids would react like in that situation.In short, if you're aged 17-30 I suggest you go see this movie now.
