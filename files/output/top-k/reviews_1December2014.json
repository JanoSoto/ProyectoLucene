I'm a big fan of Lars Von Trier's films (apart from The Idiots) and I understand that he was part of the whole Dogme 95 wave of filmmaking which saw Danes making films on hand-held cameras, using no props and no false lighting. Festen is the first official film to adhere to all these rules, although director Thomas Vinterberg did later admit to covering a window in one scene. Naughty, naughty! You'd think that it would be pretty difficult to make a good film in these conditions (have you seen The Idiots? It's dreadful!) but Festen somehow pulls it off. It's not just a good film, it's a great film.I was immediately engaged from the start with the strange camera angles and movements instantly grabbing my attention. In fact, it's this strange visual style which makes the film so involving and gripping. At times it feels like we're watching a fly-on-the-wall documentary, or perhaps some found footage from one of the guests. It also helps that the performances feel so real. You completely buy into the whole situation, no matter how darkly farcical it becomes.Festen features an array of characters who stick in your head after the film has finished. My favourite was probably Michael who had me laughing out loud on several occasions. He's an utterly over-the-top vile loon! Of course, the more you see of him, the more you start to dislike him and wonder how on earth he ever got married and managed to have two kids in the process! The film really gets going when one of the sons gets up to do a speech. Awkward doesn't even begin to describe it.The less you know about Festen the better! I avoided reviews because I didn't want any of the various shocks or twists revealed to me. That way you can become one of the guests who look in horror as the family's dysfunctions are revealed over the course of the night. I think a lot of credit has to go to Thomas' screenplay. It's a wonderful script which makes full use of its one-location idea and reveals its drama through character interactions which don't feel contrived in any way.I understand that Festen has been turned into a play and I can see why. There's so much bubbling under the surface and it often explodes beautifully in front of us. I love the way the characters slowly develop as the film goes on, as we get to learn new things about them. It makes the film so much richer and deeper. I also loved the ambiguity of it all. It's never made clear, until the end, whether what's being said is true or not.Towards the end of the film, Festen reveals itself as something much more than a dark comedy. It becomes a very sad and moving tale about childhood atrocities and losing someone you love. There's a haunting dream sequence at the end of the film which I found beautifully done and quite emotional. Festen is a great film, full of great performances and excellent filmmaking. Thomas Vinterberg isn't afraid to shock the audience, but unlike Lars in The Idiots, the controversial material is all relevant to the story and not used merely to make the audience react.

Before we get to him we've been following the man who will become his confidant, Joe Buck (Jon Voight), a hick who has traveled from Texas to New York believing that his formidable manhood will allow him to make a living pleasuring rich women. As it begins, it doesn't go well, he is a babe in the jungle and doesn't learn from his mistake after he is ripped off.He meets Ratso, who claims that he can get him good gigs with high-class rich women. The man is a complete sleaze, but Joe Buck learns to trust him even after Ratso steals $20 from an arrangement that goes bad. He confides in Joe Buck that he wants to go to Florida and work the circuit down there. For Ratso, Florida is a place that is less squalid and also a place where no one knows him. It would be a chance to start over. The problem is that luck is not with them and neither is Ratso's health, which gets worse and worse. But as he declines, he and Joe Buck grow closer until Joe Buck turns down a lucrative offer in order to help his friend realize his dream.Ratso isn't like anyone we've seen in the movies (or wanted to). He's a sleazy little rat with a bum's coat, a pale face, nasty stubble, a whiney voice, a limp and a cigarette that hangs from his lip. It is difficult to like him but even more difficult not to feel something for him especially when he falls ill. What we notice first from Ratso is his defensive shield &#x96; he puts up the false front of a tough guy even though we can see that he is insecure down to his bones. Crossing the street with Joe Buck he is nearly hit by a cab and screams, I'm walking here! (The line was improvised by Hoffman when a real cab nearly ran over him.) He is knowledgeable about the New York streets (or at least seems to be), convincing the naive Joe Buck that he knows what it takes to find rich ladies who want a good time. He gives his client a place to sleep, back in his disgusting apartment in a condemned building where Ratso's facade begins to crack. Sitting in the dark with a cup of soup in his hand and tears in his eyes, he cries as he fears the ailment that will soon consume him. You know what they do to you when they know you can't w-walk, he tells Joe Buck, I'm scared. The performance comes from Hoffman's refusal to ask for our sympathies. He plays the character as a complete sleaze, a man who carries himself like a rodent and who plies his trade in a bottom-feeding industry. He stands within his environment as a result of urban decay and yet when Joe Buck feels sympathy for him we can't help but follow suit. There is something of a halted childhood in Ratso, as if he grew up but forgot to leave his defensive emotional blanket behind.I only have one quibble I wish the performance were in a better movie. The scenes between Hoffman and Voight are beautifully done, giving us the portrait of two lost souls who have found solace in one another, but those scenes are interrupted by silly scenes like a trip to an upscale party and a scene where Joe Buck shoves a telephone into the mouth of an elderly gay man. Those scenes break up the narrative and fall on the personal story like a ton of bricks. It almost feels like director John Schlesinger and screenwriter Walto Salt didn't have enough faith in their material to let the relationship lead the story. They keep letting film's forward momentum get gummed up by intrusive moments like a series of badly photographed flashbacks to Joe Buck's past.Despite anyone's objections, the film would go on to win Best Picture &#x96; the only X-rated film ever to do so &#x96; and would win further Oscars for Best Director and Adapted Screenplay. I think Hoffman would have won were it not for John Wayne. Here, he silenced critics who had written him off as a one-note actor after his performance as Benjamin Braddock in The Graduate. Ratso is a completely new character that showed Hoffman's range and showed the promise of the multiple notes that he could play. In the decade that would follow, he would provide us with the multitudes of characters he could play like Jack Crabb in Little Big Man, Louis Dega in Papillion, Lenny Bruce in Lenny, Max Dembo in Straight Time, Michael Dorsey\/Dorothy Michaels in Tootsie, Willie Loman in Death of a Salesman, Raymond Babbit in Rain Man among many others.

After a sole writing nomination for one of his earlier works, Jackson started his big run with the Academy awards here back in 2002. The first hour was pretty great here. I thought the female narrator was a good introduction to the films and I also really enjoyed looking at all the juicy green from the Shire. And we should be glad the headless horseman did not manage to get little Frodo after 60 minutes as then the whole tale would have been over already. That Frodo seemed quite a survivalist anyway looking at the quantity of situations where he came out alive, almost like the Chosen One from The Matrix. However, the actor who plays Agent Smith is one of the good ones here. They all seem to have a talent to stay away from death, even if they are getting in the most dangerous situations, like Gandalf falling deep down and becoming the White Gandalf. This applies also to many other characters who keep getting missed by Orc arrows by centimeters. Lucky bunch.Anyway, back to the story. This is obviously a fantasy drama, but it has its fair share of comedic moments as well. Most of these involve the two other Hobbits or pretty much every scene with Gimli the dwarf, for example when he asks to not be pulled on his beard. While we're at it, that nasty creature down there in the dwarfs' graveyard is truly disgusting. Most of the film is about the journey, though, the whole adventure when the group is still together. At the end, they split up. Frodo and Sam keep going to destroy the ring. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli try to free the other two hobbits. I can't say the film did not drag a single second during its 3.5 hours runtime (for me it mostly did during the fight sequences), but at least we get to watch beautiful landscapes and cinematography from start to finish. Also all the creatures included here are fairly special and memorable.One of my favorite scenes is when we see Frodo's grief and regret when Gandalf allegedly dies as Frodo was the one who wanted to take the Moria route and Gandalf did not. Another one I liked was the Elf marching scene early on when Sam says it makes him sad for some reason. It's almost like a special march of animals (penguins for example, or birds flying south). Two scenes I did not like that much were when we saw what the ring does to people. Bilbo and Galadriel look almost like horror movie creatures during their respective scenes and that is not a course the film takes at any other point. This film is all about Sauron's invisible danger and these two transformation scenes did not work in its favor. Nonetheless, Saruman felt more like the main antagonist in this film here, first of all of course because of his fight against Gandalf and then also because he pretty much commands the Orc army. During one scene he gives the order to kill all those who accompany the Hobbits. Then there is the usual components to this kind of movies, such as the enemy within the group, who (luckily to Frodo?) gets killed by the Orc army.Elijah Wood was one of the most promising young actors back then, so it was no surprise he got cast. The bigger surprise is possibly Sean Astin, who was not that well-known, but worked wonders during the whole trilogy and is possibly my favorite actor from the whole cast taking all three films together. Today he is possibly the epitome of the loyal friend in movie history. The movie ends with an Enya song (also Academy award nominated). She did the super successful song connected with the 9\/11-tragedy some months earlier and her song here works very well too. Taking all components, together, this is a pretty good movie and a must-see for everybody with an interest in the fantasy genre.

The character Plato is introduced in the first scene in the police station where all of the other main characters are introduced as well. But instead of being held there for being out too late or for a bit of drunkenness, it is discovered that he killed some puppies. This should already be a red flag for his character. And when asked about why he did it, he responds with I don't know. Except you can tell that he little douchebag is lying, you know that he has some dark reason hidden on the inside on why he killed those puppies. From the beginning of the movie you know that he is going to be a little douchebag. The next day comes and he meets James Dean's character. For some reason, he becomes so attached to his character for no reason at all, later saying I hope he takes me hunting and fishing, because I don't know how, and I know he'll teach me. like James Dean is his dad or something. What a weirdo. Then later when he realizes that James Dean is in danger he grabs a gun. RED FLAG. We can tell that no good is going to come out of this. When he falls asleep at the abandoned mansion James Dean and the character Judy go to another room to make out or some crap. Then when the stereotype greasers come to beat him and James Dean up, he freaks out and pulls out his gun and almost kills one of the greasers and almost kills James Dean. He then goes into a trance like condition where he acts like a baby and complains about not having a mommy or daddy while running from the police. He ends up dead. Good. Screw Plato. This all takes place in ONE DAY. In ONE DAY he becomes this attached to another person. COME ON.Then there is the character Judy. Judy meets James Dean on the first day of school and treats him like fat people do to salad to fit in with her boyfriend Buzz and his stereotype greaser friends. So then later at the Chicken race ,or whatever it is called, Buzz dies by having his jacket caught in the door before he can jump out. So what does Judy do about her now dead boyfriend? Mourn? Cry her eyes out? Nope! She barely appears sad about it and then moves on straight to James Dean within AN HOUR of Buzz's death. Dear Buzz, Sorry, but I don't really care about your death because James Dean is here. From Judy. P.S. Screw you. Later in the movie, which is only like a couple hours later in the story of the film, Judy literally tells James Dean that she is in love with him. Really? She literally just met in him earlier that day. And she is in love with him? It makes no sense at all really, I do not like her at all. I wish that James Dean could carry this movie on his own, but I just don't like his character that much.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"1 December 2014","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Searching For a Whole New WorldJust imagine falling in love with someone from a completely different world. Would you try and make it work? In the Disney movie, The Little Mermaid, a young mermaid did everything that she could to live happily ever after with a young human prince. This movie is an animated fantasy and would generally be for young children and more aimed at the girls, but I think it's a great for everyone. As you would expect for all movies like this one, there are certain expectations that should be met good character introduction and role, underlying life lessons, and music as well as talking. The Little Mermaid is worth watching it follows expectations, its entertaining, and has a great story line&#x97;easy to follow and fun for everyone&#x97;with life lessons within the movie.The Little Mermaid has several characters; the main characters are introduced well and there is never question on who is who. They all have their own role in the movie and there is just enough to keep track of but not so many that you lose track of them. Ariel is the main character and is s strong girl who takes risks to get attain what she strives to achieve. Some may argue that the bad character, Ursula, is too scary for young children and that the ending was changed making it not as good. But the ending was changed to make it more kid friendly and many people don't know the original version in the first place. Also it may be a bit frightening and make kids jump, but there is nothing bad that happens to main characters.The movie has many underlying lessons that are portrayed as well as common issues that young girls come across in their life time. First of all, Ariel and her father don't get along to well, and he is against her falling in love with a human. They argue and after giving her a little trust and legs to walk on land, Ariel proves the love between her and the prince is real. Another part that is displaying a common problem with young girls is their looks and worry about looking good. Ariel mentions her beauty and her looks in several scenes throughout the movie hoping the prince is happy with them; she later realizes this is not as important as true love.Lastly, the story line and music along with the movie is well put together. This movie is similar to a musical because all of the songs and music played goes along with the story line and the lyrics either support the story or add on to it. When she is striving to be with the prince and hoping one day she will be able to, she breaks out into a song that supports what she is trying to do. Some of the lyrics say, I don't know when\/ I don't know how\/ But I know something's starting right now\/ Watch and you'll see\/ Someday I'll be\/ Part of Your World. She wants so badly to be part of the prince's world on land rather than her world in the water. The music ties everything together and keeps you focused on the movie.Overall, this is a great movie for kids and families to watch.

Would you try and make it work? In the Disney movie, The Little Mermaid, a young mermaid did everything that she could to live happily ever after with a young human prince. This movie is an animated fantasy and would generally be for young children and more aimed at the girls, but I think it's a great for everyone. As you would expect for all movies like this one, there are certain expectations that should be met good character introduction and role, underlying life lessons, and music as well as talking. The Little Mermaid is worth watching it follows expectations, its entertaining, and has a great story line&#x97;easy to follow and fun for everyone&#x97;with life lessons within the movie.The Little Mermaid has several characters; the main characters are introduced well and there is never question on who is who. They all have their own role in the movie and there is just enough to keep track of but not so many that you lose track of them. Ariel is the main character and is s strong girl who takes risks to get attain what she strives to achieve. Some may argue that the bad character, Ursula, is too scary for young children and that the ending was changed making it not as good. But the ending was changed to make it more kid friendly and many people don't know the original version in the first place. Also it may be a bit frightening and make kids jump, but there is nothing bad that happens to main characters.The movie has many underlying lessons that are portrayed as well as common issues that young girls come across in their life time. First of all, Ariel and her father don't get along to well, and he is against her falling in love with a human. They argue and after giving her a little trust and legs to walk on land, Ariel proves the love between her and the prince is real. Another part that is displaying a common problem with young girls is their looks and worry about looking good. Ariel mentions her beauty and her looks in several scenes throughout the movie hoping the prince is happy with them; she later realizes this is not as important as true love.Lastly, the story line and music along with the movie is well put together. This movie is similar to a musical because all of the songs and music played goes along with the story line and the lyrics either support the story or add on to it. When she is striving to be with the prince and hoping one day she will be able to, she breaks out into a song that supports what she is trying to do. Some of the lyrics say, I don't know when\/ I don't know how\/ But I know something's starting right now\/ Watch and you'll see\/ Someday I'll be\/ Part of Your World. She wants so badly to be part of the prince's world on land rather than her world in the water. The music ties everything together and keeps you focused on the movie.Overall, this is a great movie for kids and families to watch. Ariel takes risks and is strong as she changes from the underwater world to the on land world. I would give it 8 out of 10 stars and would recommend those who haven't seen it to watch it if they get a chance.

You have probably heard of this film and how it is often shown at midnight with an audience dressing up, singing along and shouting non-stop at the screen. That's exactly how you should see the movie because at home, by yourself it really isn't anything special. This broad musical follows Brad Majors (Barry Bostwick) and Janet Weiss (Susan Sarandon) who find themselves stranded in a rainstorm on a strange road after getting engaged. Seeking a telephone, the couple decide to get out of the car and travel a creepy castle spotted earlier in the road. When they arrive, they find that the Annual Transylvanian Convention is being held. Bizarre-looking characters are singing, dancing and being extremely frank about their sexuality, much to Brad and Janet's shock. Things become even stranger when the head of the convention, Dr. Frank N. Furter (Tim Curry) arrives. He is dressed in a corset, fishnets, wears bright lipstick and strips the couple of their clothes before bringing them and the rest of the convention to his laboratory where he presents his creation, a perfect man named Rocky (Peter Hinwood). After witnessing Frank N. Furter's depravity, Frank and Janet are sent to bed, but the Dr.'s influence is already starting to affect them...Technically, this is not a very well made movie. The acting isn't particularly good, the plot is often barely intelligible, there are wardrobe malfunctions (Magenta before being turned to stone, Dr. Frank during the end of the film), badly choreographed dance numbers, scenes where characters don't act like human beings at all (like when Janet puts on her robe, takes three steps then takes it off again), scenes where the low production really shows (when getting wet, Dr. Frank's tattoo can be seen running). If you're watching the movie just by yourself, not knowing what you're getting into you'll just be wondering what the big deal is about. This is where the audience participation comes in. Despite its flaws, the film is very memorable and features many catchy songs. It's got a lot of iconic imagery and the dialogue lends itself well to ridicule. It's likely that there's a theatre somewhere near where you live that will at some point show the film and let the audience participate. If you're curious at all about the movie, that's the way to see it. Depending on how obsessive the fans are and how crowded the theatre is, if you're a newcomer (or virgin) you might find yourself getting hazed. If you're lucky, the worst that will happen to you while the film is playing is getting pelted by rice and confetti but you might end up getting soaked or get hit upside the head by toast. Ideally, at least one person will know the scripted lines to appropriately riff on the movie and will have just as much dialogue as all of the characters put together. That's really the only way to see the film barely being able to hear what is going on unless the characters are singing, not really caring about what the plot is unless Tim Curry is on the screen and gleefully pointing out all of the flaws in the production.Reviewing the film really feels kind of pointless. The fans of the film are die-hard fans and would gleefully come at me with an ice pick if I recommend that you don't watch the movie. Unless you've seen the movie with an audience and know what the experience is like, there's no sense in watching the movie at home. I like to think of The Rocky Horror Picture as one of those indoor roller-coasters where a screen shows graphics while your seat rumbles and swings back and forth. The video by itself is pointless to watch on its own and if you did, you would be very disappointed. You would be missing the point though, it isn't even meant to be seen on its own. It's meant to be seen with all of those people screaming and throwing stuff in the air. Having seen the movie by itself at home, I'd give it a middling 2,5\/5; nothing special. This is where that asterisk comes in though. With an audience that knows what it's doing, an MC and people dressing up, it's a blast and easily comes up to a 5\/5, if only because it's an experience you will never forget.

Though its true that Psycho might have been the first true modern horror film, it took the rest of the decade for the genre to catch up to Hitchcock's masterpiece. The movie that truly signaled the changing of the guard, that dragged horror kicking and screaming into the modern age, was George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead. The film's biggest contribution to the horror genre, and all of pop culture truthfully, is the modern conception of the zombie. Before this film, the only version of zombies known to the world were the traditional voodoo zombies, undead servants controlled by a master. In Night of the Living Dead, the zombies are corpses risen to life to feed upon the flesh of the living. The only way to kill one is to destroy the brain through whatever means. These are the rules that have come to define the entire zombie genre. For the record, Romero never intended to completely redefine the zombie. In his original script, he referred to the creatures as ghouls, a similar but distinct mythological creature. His main inspiration for the movie was Richard Matheson's I Am Legend, which was a novel about vampires. These specifics ended up not mattering. From the moment it was released, the ghouls in Night of the Living Dead were zombies. Henceforth, everything that acted like them were also zombies.Another aspect that has elevated the film into the upper-echelon of great horror movies is George Romero and his actors taking the material one-hundred percent seriously. The director intentionally invited a number of subtextual angles. Night is about the end of the sixties. The film is literally about a new culture arising to devour the old one. Society as we know it is overturned. The rules of life and death, as traditionally understood, are completely rewritten. Early on, Johnny makes a dismissive reference to religion. Later on, a news report says there's no time for ceremony when disposing of the dead. Religious certainties are invalid now too.If Night isn't the first modern horror film, it is, perhaps, the first post-Vietnam horror film. There's a stark quality to the way the film is shot. It frequently feels like a newsreel. These aren't movie stars in a glossy production. These are normal people involved in horrifying circumstances. In opposition to generations of Gothic horror films, the horror isn't in some exotic forgien land. It's in your backyard. By the same accord, the film brings the horror of Vietnam home. Romero and company have repeatedly denied the casting of Duane Jones, a black man, in the lead role having any significance. Yet his presence undeniably affects how the viewer watches the film. For all the layers in the film, its most universal point is that mankind is incapable of communicating. If Ben and Mr. Cooper worked together against the zombies, they might have survived the night. Instead, they bicker, argue, and compete. Humanity will never be able to get anywhere because we can't stop arguing with each other over petty, pointless bullshit.You can read a lot into Night of the Living Dead. As sophisticated as the writing is, Night is still a low budget horror film made by a first time crew. The seams show repeatedly. The camera positions are frequently awkward, sometimes creating unintentional dutch angles. The editing can be hazardous and sudden at times. The film is scored with stock library music which frequently blares and is as inelegant as possible. The story has a thrown-together quality at times, reminding the viewer how quickly and cheaply it was shot. George had a lot of stuff on his mind but the writing is still, at times, pulpy. Barbara is a defenseless woman who spends half of the movie as a frantic wreck and the other half unconscious on a couch. There are long sequences of characters walking through the house or boarding up windows which come off slightly as padding.If Night wasn't remember for birthing the modern zombie genre, it would be remember for its then-shocking amount of gore. The movie was released in a post-Blood Feast world so it's not like splatter films were a new concept. However, no movie before Night treated gore in such a visceral way. Zombies have bloody holes blown through them, which they easily shrug off. Ben stabs one ghoul in the head with a tire iron. The most infamous moment follows the explosion of the pick-up truck. An undead orgy of feasting follows, the zombies fighting over a trail of intestines and chomping down on organs and body parts. Though crude, the gore is still sickening today strictly because of the matter-of-fact way its handled. The film is going for shocks. A little girl stabs her mother to death with a trowel before gnawing on her dad's arm. Ultimately, the downbeat, bleak tone of Night of the Living Dead grants its violence more power. This is a world without happy endings. The government doesn't swoop in at the end to the save the day, like Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Instead, slack-jawed rednecks shoot the hero in the head, mistaking him for a zombie. The ending is sudden and nihilistic but more than makes its point.A strong helps seal the deal. Duane Jones is charismatic and gives a committed performance, even making Romero's sometimes awkward dialogue work. Karl Hardman is also notable as the bristly, hard-edged Harry Cooper. Some of the actors, like Keith Wayne or Judith Ridley, aren't as good though, giving stiff performances. Sometimes the low budget details are distracting, sometimes they are affective.

The movie that truly signaled the changing of the guard, that dragged horror kicking and screaming into the modern age, was George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead. The film's biggest contribution to the horror genre, and all of pop culture truthfully, is the modern conception of the zombie. Before this film, the only version of zombies known to the world were the traditional voodoo zombies, undead servants controlled by a master. In Night of the Living Dead, the zombies are corpses risen to life to feed upon the flesh of the living. The only way to kill one is to destroy the brain through whatever means. These are the rules that have come to define the entire zombie genre. For the record, Romero never intended to completely redefine the zombie. In his original script, he referred to the creatures as ghouls, a similar but distinct mythological creature. His main inspiration for the movie was Richard Matheson's I Am Legend, which was a novel about vampires. These specifics ended up not mattering. From the moment it was released, the ghouls in Night of the Living Dead were zombies. Henceforth, everything that acted like them were also zombies.Another aspect that has elevated the film into the upper-echelon of great horror movies is George Romero and his actors taking the material one-hundred percent seriously. The director intentionally invited a number of subtextual angles. Night is about the end of the sixties. The film is literally about a new culture arising to devour the old one. Society as we know it is overturned. The rules of life and death, as traditionally understood, are completely rewritten. Early on, Johnny makes a dismissive reference to religion. Later on, a news report says there's no time for ceremony when disposing of the dead. Religious certainties are invalid now too.If Night isn't the first modern horror film, it is, perhaps, the first post-Vietnam horror film. There's a stark quality to the way the film is shot. It frequently feels like a newsreel. These aren't movie stars in a glossy production. These are normal people involved in horrifying circumstances. In opposition to generations of Gothic horror films, the horror isn't in some exotic forgien land. It's in your backyard. By the same accord, the film brings the horror of Vietnam home. Romero and company have repeatedly denied the casting of Duane Jones, a black man, in the lead role having any significance. Yet his presence undeniably affects how the viewer watches the film. For all the layers in the film, its most universal point is that mankind is incapable of communicating. If Ben and Mr. Cooper worked together against the zombies, they might have survived the night. Instead, they bicker, argue, and compete. Humanity will never be able to get anywhere because we can't stop arguing with each other over petty, pointless bullshit.You can read a lot into Night of the Living Dead. As sophisticated as the writing is, Night is still a low budget horror film made by a first time crew. The seams show repeatedly. The camera positions are frequently awkward, sometimes creating unintentional dutch angles. The editing can be hazardous and sudden at times. The film is scored with stock library music which frequently blares and is as inelegant as possible. The story has a thrown-together quality at times, reminding the viewer how quickly and cheaply it was shot. George had a lot of stuff on his mind but the writing is still, at times, pulpy. Barbara is a defenseless woman who spends half of the movie as a frantic wreck and the other half unconscious on a couch. There are long sequences of characters walking through the house or boarding up windows which come off slightly as padding.If Night wasn't remember for birthing the modern zombie genre, it would be remember for its then-shocking amount of gore. The movie was released in a post-Blood Feast world so it's not like splatter films were a new concept. However, no movie before Night treated gore in such a visceral way. Zombies have bloody holes blown through them, which they easily shrug off. Ben stabs one ghoul in the head with a tire iron. The most infamous moment follows the explosion of the pick-up truck. An undead orgy of feasting follows, the zombies fighting over a trail of intestines and chomping down on organs and body parts. Though crude, the gore is still sickening today strictly because of the matter-of-fact way its handled. The film is going for shocks. A little girl stabs her mother to death with a trowel before gnawing on her dad's arm. Ultimately, the downbeat, bleak tone of Night of the Living Dead grants its violence more power. This is a world without happy endings. The government doesn't swoop in at the end to the save the day, like Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Instead, slack-jawed rednecks shoot the hero in the head, mistaking him for a zombie. The ending is sudden and nihilistic but more than makes its point.A strong helps seal the deal. Duane Jones is charismatic and gives a committed performance, even making Romero's sometimes awkward dialogue work. Karl Hardman is also notable as the bristly, hard-edged Harry Cooper. Some of the actors, like Keith Wayne or Judith Ridley, aren't as good though, giving stiff performances. Sometimes the low budget details are distracting, sometimes they are affective. Either way, Night of the Living Dead is unforgettable, still scary to this day, and surely one of the most influential horror films ever made.

Especially the people who don't like science fiction, because they'll learn to like it. It's great, the geek gets the girl, the bully is taken down, there's a crazy doctor and the kid fixes his parents' past. It's pretty amazing. The characters themselves were true to the setting and represented the 1980's and the 1950's perfectly. The DeLorean was the coolest time machine ever. If I learned anything from this movie, it's that you have to ride in style. It had a great plot, good camera work, some scientific accuracy, and a smooth ending. While I loved all of those things, there are a few things I would change. There were a few questions that weren't answered. What happened between 1955 and 1985 that made things the way they are? There are too many things that happened in those thirty years that weren't explained. Biff, George, and Loraine still had lives and their stories weren't explained. And then, on top of that, unless you see Back to the Future Part II, the ending is just a huge cliffhanger. Why does the DeLorean suddenly fly? Who what's wrong with Marty's kids? What does Doc mean Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads!? I guess ending it that way was a good move because then, you want to see Part II, you NEED to see Part II, or else you'll be left with a million questions that are left unanswered. It was the greatest, strangest, and most confusing two minutes of the entire movie, but that's what makes it so great. All in all, it was a great movie and definitely a science-fiction classic. I loved and I would recommend this movie to every one. If you're not a science-fiction fan, you will be, after experiencing the magic of Back to the Future.

Obviously, the mill does not want it's workers to organize. After the organizer arrives he ends up making friends with a worker at the mill. Obviously there is more to the story then this but this is the basic synopsis. The film does a good job of telling the story of how some of the blue collar workers are treated in our country. The quality of the film stock reminds me of a B movie. But the acting and story are superb and nothing short of a quality A list flick. I know the movie came out in 1979, so I was expecting a little lower quality film stock but this is so far below the standards of the time that I think it was by design to help put the viewers in the shoes of the cotton mill workers. The trick was nothing short of effective, I think this low quality of the film's picture helped put me in the right frame of mind. As far as the acting goes it is great. In fact Sally field wan an Oscar for her performance in the movie. And I think the labor organizer at least deserved a nomination. The other Oscar that the film won was for Best Original Song, and the song deserved it. The music here is simple and the song defiantly anchors the light soundtrack.

It's a war movie which doesn't really contain an awful lot of 'war' stuff, meaning that fans of the genre will appreciate it as much as those who aren't into the Second World War 2. The stellar cast. Okay, so some of the twelve prisoners conscripted into Lee Marvin's secret task force aren't that memorable, but there are plenty who are... Charles Bronson and Telly Savalis to name but two. 3. Naturally, a great cast produces great performances. There's no room for a 'weakest link' here. 4. Everyone roots for the 'antihero.' And here we not only have twelve convicted felons to cheer on, but also their leader &#x96; the allegedly pure Lee Marvin &#x96; is also as prone to 'rule-breaking' as his new charges 5. Black humour. Yes, there may be a war on, but there are a handful of light-hearted moments dotted about here and there that to lighten the tone enough. 6. It's epic. The two hours it runs for don't feel like it. 7. It doesn't pull any punches. As I said... there is a war on and you may find yourself grinning one minute before being completely horrified by the level of brutality that transpired during the historical period. 8. One hell of a tense finale &#x96; when the mission comes, it's worth the wait. You'll be on the edge of your seat as you cheer all your newfound antiheros on.Basically, 'The Dirty Dozen' is a war film that's more akin to simply being put in the 'action' bracket, rather than classed as a straight 'war film.' The mission never actually happened. This film is total fiction. But there's always that feeling at the back of your mind regarding how, although it never transpired, it probably very well nearly did.You don't have to be a war film fan to enjoy this, just enjoy a mismatched bunch of rag-tag antiheros, working together (and sometimes against each other!) on a mission to kill Nazis.
