The fun of this movie is taking classic and modern archetypes and turning them on their heads. Leopold (Jackman) is an aristocrat but one with a passion for science. He seeks to break free from the constraints of societal conventions in 19th century New York. Meanwhile, Kate (Meg Ryan) has pushed to break out from traditional female roles. As her boss J.J. (Bradley Whitford) comments, You're a rarity among women, Kate. You don't cling to illusion. You don't get caught up in emotion. You don't do pretty. You skew male. You're like a man. A man who understands women - their desires, their needs. You understand them but you're not really one of them. Some people may need to justify a romantic comedy in order to give it value. If that is the case, note that this story is about two people who are struggling with conventions and have lost their own identities in the process. Flailing at opposite ends of the spectrum, Kate provides Leopold with the inspiration to break from conventions and be true to himself while Leopold provides Kate with the safety and security to allow her guard down and be true to her own femininity. There is a greater thematic meaning to this film beyond simple love. It is about the pressures of society, how success can seem tied to having to conform to societal conventions, how we lose ourselves in the pressure and how relationships with others can ground us and help us find ourselves amidst the mêlée of societal forces.Although the story of Kate & Leopold's romance is the center of the film, it is not the only relationship which provides a grounding force. Kate's relationship with her upstairs neighbor and former beau, Stuart, who remains an intimate friend despite her bitterness and her relationship with her brother, Charlie, provide her with the strength to face the unknown and the security to take a chance on love. For Leopold, it is his manservant, Otis, who plays the role of father while Charlie and Stuart are also renewed in their relationship with Leopold. Surely, this is not just a romantic comedy but a story about the relationships in our lives and struggles against societal conventions.The highest praise I can give this movie is that I purchased it - a rare occurrence. I do not see the point of owning something unless I am willing to watch it many times over. It was the first and one of 6 movies I own.Hugh Jackman's acting is charming, sincere and genuine. My reaction was Wow! What a great actor. He made it easy to believe in his character.Sometimes I find Meg Ryan a bit rough but that was the purpose of her tough, manly facade. This is what makes the moments she lets her guard down and becomes a woman so special.Enjoy it as a fun love story or listen to the deeper themes of integrity and compassion. Either way... the cinematography is gorgeous, particularly as it juxtaposes new and old New York; the costumes are delightful; the music is passionate.One warning - BYPASS THE DIRECTOR'S CUT. It muddles the story with a bizarre choice of familial intertwining. I watched it once with someone who had never seen the theatrical version - yuck! It spoiled the movie for me and the other person missed the magic of the original cut. STICK TO THE ORIGINAL.

At the time of it's release, DICK TRACY's visual style was unlike anything the movies had seen and perhaps some of the public didn't know what to make of it. Beatty decided to have a color palette of just 7 crisp colors, the same colors that were available when the Dick Tracy comics were first published. By doing so, he has created a cinematic world that has the miraculous ability of never feeling dated. This is incredibly refreshing when you consider that fact that the continuous development of computer technology and special effects has caused so many great movies of the past to lose some of their magic over the years. Not the case with DICK TRACY.Warren Beatty has certainly proved himself over the years to be an incredible contributor to the art form of film with a resume including REDS, BUGSY, BONNIE & CLYDE and more. However, never before and never since has Beatty put out a film full of such nostalgic excitement and fun.Though there were many different comics and story lines regarding everyone's favorite cop Dick Tracy, Beatty managed to consolidate them all into one engrossing film. DICK TRACY begins with Big Boy Caprice (played by Al Pacino with a great deal of abandon and fun) starting to gather together all the city's gangsters for one unified deal. Together, all of them can rule the city.Big Boy's plan includes buying out the nightclub where Breathless Mahoney (played by Madonna, in perhaps her best performance) sings and then turning it into a den for underground gambling. Meanwhile, Dick Tracy and his ever-faithful girlfriend Tess Trueheart (Glenne Headley) have just taken under their wing a young orphan (an incredible Charlie Korsmo) with an endless appetite for food and action. As Dick Tracy tries to get to the bottom of Big Boy's plan, he sees his only link to getting to the truth is Breathless Mahoney... a woman who's not willing to help him until he shows interest in having her as his woman.The plot is simple, but it is more then compelling enough as a compliment to the incredible visual flair of Beatty's comic book adaptation. Everything including the special effects, make-up, costumes, music, and all the performances are perfectly suited to the film's tone. Everything has a comical cartoonish quality to it, including the dialogue, however everyone involved seems so aware of this quality that they've successfully embraced it and incorporated into their work.For such a unique film, it's amazing that all the pieces can come together and blend so wonderfully as a cohesive whole... but I suppose that's just a credit to Beatty's directing here. He has managed to literally bring the world of the Dick Tracy comic strips to life on screen in a manner that has only been matched by Robert Rodriguez's SIN CITY. They are two films very different in substance, however their ability to create a unique world so powerfully is unmatched by other comic adaptations.One of DICK TRACY's most entertaining qualities is the cast it has gathered together. The ensemble is a who's who of great actors even down to the smallest of roles (watch for Kathy Bates and Catherine O'Hara in blink & you miss them cameos). Everyone here is having fun without losing focus. Pacino's Big Boy is a thrillingly over-the-top bad guy opposite Beatty's cool and collected all-American hero. Also, the two leading females offer polar opposite performances of equal appeal. Madonna has never been so compelling in a role (aside from a refreshing performance in A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN) and she embodies a Marilyn Monroe gone bad like no other could have. Glenne Headley is so engagingly sweet that you don't even notice how spineless she is... she's the epitome of damsel in distress. And Charlie Korsmo as the kid offers one of the most brashly confident child performances captured on film in recent years.To top it off, DICK TRACY also features some incredible original music from Stephen Sondheim. Music plays a major role in DICK TRACY from the montages to the live performances, and yet it only enhances the film. DICK TRACY is just an example of all the elements adding up to make a great whole... and there's no single element that ruins it for the rest of them. This is a movie that made me feel like I was a kid again in awe of the new things that only film can show me. It's a shame DICK TRACY isn't more fondly remembered then it is... b\/c for today's filmmaker this should be held up high as an example of what to aim for when creating a comic book adaptation....

With a guy like Barry Levinson directing, having classic comedies like Diner and Toys, (another ill-received winner) under his belt and dramedies like Rain Man, you know you will be entertained. If you still feel unsure after finding out it stars Bruce Willis and two of the best actors working today in Billy Bob Thornton, (when not playing the vulgar schlub he has lately), and Cate Blanchett, you don't enjoy cinema. This trifecta of actors really shine together causing laughs at every turn while still grounding the film enough to keep the serious criminal consequences relevant.Breaking out of jail on a whim, Joe (Willis) and Terry (Thornton) find themselves free men needing money. They decide to rob banks long enough to make a nest egg to run a hotel\/ club down in Mexico; yes that is where they are keeping Acapaulco these days. They become the sleepover bandits as they kidnap the bank manager the night before the crime so as to take the money without hostages causing a problem. Just the satirical notion of these hardened criminals becoming overnight celebrities where bank managers revel in the thought that they can be victims, is funny enough. Throw in Cate Blanchett's manic-depressive housewife on her last thread Kate, and we have some really laugh-out-loud hijinks. When she is singing to cheesy 80's Bonnie Tyler music while cooking and driving, you can see the amazing comic timing she possesses to go along with the dramatic chops she usually shows. One of our most versatile actresses, maybe not quite deserving of the Oscar last year, but definitely worthy of the Oscar-winner status, there hasn't been a bad performance by her that I have seen. I can't wait until later this year when she joins heavyweights Alejandro González Iñárritu and Guillermo Arriaga with their emotional epic Babel.Bruce Willis shows again that playing against his tough-guy type is really where he succeeds best. Joe has all the charisma and muscle of an action hero, but also the sarcasm and wit to really poke fun at the stereotype. Thornton gives a magnificently physically showing as the hyperchondriac Terry. His idiosynchrsies are hilarious to watch and the banter with both Joe and Kate is perfect. There are so many one-liners that spew from his fast-talking, too smart for his own safety mind. You know the hardest thing about being smart? You pretty much know what's gonna happen next. There's no suspense. He also has the uncanny demeanor to switch personas mid-sentence, acting tough and then, when ridiculed about his disguise, almost quietly, as though to a confidant, asking if it really is that bad.Rounding out the comic genius is relative newcomer Troy Garity. His stuntman is the ultimate stereotypical guy's guy whom needs to be babysat at every turn by the two criminal minds. The childlike fascination is perpetually ingrained into his features and expressions as he is just a kid in a candy store. Garity's charm makes the role successful and an integral part to the story. Credit writer Harley Peyton for loading his script with so many disparate characters which when mixed together work together like clockwork. After writing ensemble work with quirky roles in the likes of TV show Twin Peaks, one can see why. Hopefully we will be able to see more from him in the future, and also more like this from Barry Levinson, who's last film Envy was so bad it was released after a hiatus on the shelf for two years.

They become the sleepover bandits as they kidnap the bank manager the night before the crime so as to take the money without hostages causing a problem. Just the satirical notion of these hardened criminals becoming overnight celebrities where bank managers revel in the thought that they can be victims, is funny enough. Throw in Cate Blanchett's manic-depressive housewife on her last thread Kate, and we have some really laugh-out-loud hijinks. When she is singing to cheesy 80's Bonnie Tyler music while cooking and driving, you can see the amazing comic timing she possesses to go along with the dramatic chops she usually shows. One of our most versatile actresses, maybe not quite deserving of the Oscar last year, but definitely worthy of the Oscar-winner status, there hasn't been a bad performance by her that I have seen. I can't wait until later this year when she joins heavyweights Alejandro González Iñárritu and Guillermo Arriaga with their emotional epic Babel.Bruce Willis shows again that playing against his tough-guy type is really where he succeeds best. Joe has all the charisma and muscle of an action hero, but also the sarcasm and wit to really poke fun at the stereotype. Thornton gives a magnificently physically showing as the hyperchondriac Terry. His idiosynchrsies are hilarious to watch and the banter with both Joe and Kate is perfect. There are so many one-liners that spew from his fast-talking, too smart for his own safety mind. You know the hardest thing about being smart? You pretty much know what's gonna happen next. There's no suspense. He also has the uncanny demeanor to switch personas mid-sentence, acting tough and then, when ridiculed about his disguise, almost quietly, as though to a confidant, asking if it really is that bad.Rounding out the comic genius is relative newcomer Troy Garity. His stuntman is the ultimate stereotypical guy's guy whom needs to be babysat at every turn by the two criminal minds. The childlike fascination is perpetually ingrained into his features and expressions as he is just a kid in a candy store. Garity's charm makes the role successful and an integral part to the story. Credit writer Harley Peyton for loading his script with so many disparate characters which when mixed together work together like clockwork. After writing ensemble work with quirky roles in the likes of TV show Twin Peaks, one can see why. Hopefully we will be able to see more from him in the future, and also more like this from Barry Levinson, who's last film Envy was so bad it was released after a hiatus on the shelf for two years.

I wanted to get the form down, so for me, just writing was an exercise in itself. I was putting together a rather simple, down and out story nothing special. Writing in early 97'. I had heard a story on how Matt Damon and Ben Affleck had put this script together and had 'shopped' it all over Hollywood and were both kind of ready to sell it, even for a 'piece of chicken' (Jokingly they said in an interview) but they were sort of at their wits'-end when....- it finally happened.Then, look what happened...2 Oscars, 16 other awards and 34 nominations on top of that! Why? Two reasons I can find. First off, they did not give up, or give in to the temptation to finally quit. The other, and this is just a 'shot in the dark' but, the movie was victorious. No, arguments can truly take solid ground against the film, other than yes, they had an affinity for the 'F'-word. These 'Southies' were really playing the 'streeters' of Boston to steely perfection. They were who they set out to be in their writing. I was amazed, this story touched deeply. they showed the struggle and the belief in and they all sort of had a love for their 'Brilliant' janitor friend, knowing that he is destined for more than they were going to encounter in life. And they still stood up for him and with him on everything from street fights to getting him in the end to embrace what he needed to do and follow and not fear the great task ahead of him. The biggest thing for me in this story is the element of distrust, that came from Matt's Character. He was abused by his dad and through that impact that started the massive down-slide (avalanche) of destructive behavior and thoughts of uselessness in himself. He was almost brought to a place that he might not return, as he didn't feel that he could love or give anything to Skyler, because he was scared of love itself. What should have been there at his childhood home (love) was abandoned to an evil overlord that was nothing more than a 'liability' to his life and personal growth.

In the combat situations of World War I, it referred to the long stretch of land between the trenches. This was due to the fact that anyone who set foot on it was killed. In tennis, it refers to the parts of the court between the outer edge where the players begin and a certain distance from the net. This is mostly because it is difficult, if not impossible, to intercept a volley when standing in this area. In film criticism, No Man's Land refers to the kind of film that is too bad to be really enthralling, but is not bad enough to be particularly amusing. Classic examples of this phenomenon include Lethal Weapon 4, Resident Evil Apocalypse, and Scream 3. Lost In Space as a television show was never that enthralling, being more a case of Americans trying too hard to recreate Doctor Who. As a film, Lost In Space does not seem to have any idea what it is trying to be, and ends up as more of a case of being nothing to anyone.The right elements were in place where casting was concerned. Gary Oldman and William Hurt are great actors who were and still are at the top of their game. Stephen Hopkins has a mixed resumé, and I will not get into the merits of his prior films, but I do believe the defense I anticipate him using. Put simply, the best actors and director in the world cannot overcome a bad script, or bad planning. Look at RoboCop before Hollow Man, then try to tell me otherwise. And if there is one thing that Lost In Space has in abundance, it is a bad script. Akiva Goldsman's other credits include such fare as I, Robot (or Will Smith Taking A Dump On Isaac Asimov's Grave as it should be called), Batman & Robin, and Batman Forever. If I need to say more about who is to blame for this tax write-off, then you clearly have not seen enough films. And make no mistake. The audience whose nostalgia they were counting on to make money took one look, laughed, and promptly saw something else.If there is any bad acting in Lost In Space, it is mainly on Matt LeBlanc's shoulders. Famous at the time for playing a moronic TV actor in a moronic sitcom, he portrays his military officer character exactly as his moronic TV actor character would portray him. So if you are looking for proof that the cast of Friends is not entirely made up of talentless hacks, then look elsewhere. Scenes between LeBlanc and Oldman are especially amusing. Oldman, well, one of his earliest roles was portraying one of punk rock's most pathetically talentless men, a role he portrayed so well it was like looking at a ghost. Some people who have never seen him in that role would have no idea from watching him in the role of Dr. Smith, and if what I have just said is a surprise to you, then you are proving my point. Put simply, the acting is either cancelled out by the bad script, or it is just plain bad.Lost In Space did get a second lease on life being used in hi-fi stores to demonstrate expensive gear. At the time, the ability to play back home video with six channels of audio was almost the exclusive domain of the rich, and there was no shortage of individuals who would watch a film for its soundtrack rather than the film itself. And it is just as well, because the cacophony of noise that permeates the majority of Lost In Space is enough to double one's vision. As unimpressed as I was with the TV series, it is remarkable that they were able to create a weekly drama with clever conflicts and strange settings on an episodic budget that could not buy one a house these days. The film cost enough money to have built the Jupiter set, film six hundred and twelve episodes of the TV series, and still have change left over. Yet what little there seemed to be in said TV series, in terms of a soul or an intellect, is utterly absent from the film. People complain about better special effects translating into poor plots, but never have I seen a better example.The Blarp, as it is called in the credits, is not the worst example of a CGI character being used where a human or puppet would achieve better results, but it is certainly not a good one. One cannot help but think that George Lucas must have been watching. And the film really does try to be everything to everyone. To a child audience, it tries to present a cute monster or a child cast that the children could relate to. It fails there. When attempting to present enough explosions and moments of action to the adult audience, it fails. And in disconnecting most of its moorings from the TV series, it disconnects itself from most of the point it had in existing. To call this even a mediocre space travel film is flattery. While a total disrespect to the laws of science is one thing, providing no explanation for the liberties taken with said laws is another altogether. I have heard it suggested that New Line Cinema made Lost In Space was intentionally made to be as bad as possible as if it were all one big joke. Having seen the film, I can only agree.Hence, I gave Lost In Space a two out of ten. Not every film can be The Godfather, but between having garbage like this coming out every week and having a few good films per year, I definitely favour the latter.

He is a stubborn man who when the doctor tells him that he needs to get hip surgery refuses on the basis that he simply doesn't feel like it. One day he gets a call telling him that his brother, Lyle, has had a stroke. Alvin decides he needs to visit his brother and make peace for the last 10 years (in which neither of them have spoken to each other), but since he can't see well enough have a driver's license, he decides to take his lawnmower on the 300+ mile trip, dispensing fortune cookie wisdom to anyone who he happens to come into contact with... and that's it. Yes, you read that right, that's it. For two hours we watch a tired old man on a lawnmower.The entire movie is an exercise in blandness and mediocrity. Whether it's the one-note acting, the countless repeated shots of cornfields and the open road, or the repetitive score (which recycles the same two musical cues over and over again for the entire movie). The movie is so bland that when we finally have a tender moment in the bar between Alvin and a fellow WW2 veteran we, the audience, no longer care because we stopped caring about Alvin over an hour ago. Then when he finally gets to his brother, they say two lines to each other and it ends. That's it. We don't even find out exactly why they fought in the first place, other than a fleeting reference about saying nasty words to each other.Indeed we, the audience, find ourselves saying that's it? for the entirety of the movie. Early on in the movie, Alvin's mower breaks down so he gets a back ride into town, buys a new mower and starts all over again. That's it. There's a scene where Alvin stops to talk to some young bicyclists to tell them that he hates being old, and then the scene ends. That's it. There's a scene where a lady runs into a deer and goes off for minutes on end about how she hates continually driving into deer, and then she drives away. That's it. There is no conflict, there is no message. The only person who really learns anything is a runaway teenager who learns the importance of family, and she isn't even important to the narrative.It has always been a tradition for conventional movie goers to wonder how critics have come to love certain movies. This is no exception. This movie, however, makes one wonder how it even got past scripting, let alone garnering the praise of every respected critic out there. There is not a single good thing that can be said about this movie, other than perhaps it is one of the first real attempts to show that G rated movies don't only have to be for the kiddies (though this movie probably should have been rated PG for some mild language and alcohol use, but it's a minor quibble really), but that effort is not enough for me to even consider this piece of celluloid to be anywhere near watchable or recommendable. All I can say is thank heaven that I didn't have to pay to see it.one half star out of five *I'd give it zero out of five, but even I recognize that it takes a lot of effort to make even a bad movie so the half star is for the hard work that went into it.

The movie is so bland that when we finally have a tender moment in the bar between Alvin and a fellow WW2 veteran we, the audience, no longer care because we stopped caring about Alvin over an hour ago. Then when he finally gets to his brother, they say two lines to each other and it ends. That's it.

There's a scene where Alvin stops to talk to some young bicyclists to tell them that he hates being old, and then the scene ends. That's it. There's a scene where a lady runs into a deer and goes off for minutes on end about how she hates continually driving into deer, and then she drives away. That's it.

The film explores the difficult things experienced by people involved with autism, and how autistic people interact with others. It also explores autism itself, and how different autistic savants have different abilities and disabilities. At the centre of the story, however, is not Hoffman's character, Raymond, but Tom Cruise's character, his brother Charlie.Charlie Babbit is a young man at the top of his game. He works for Ferrari, has a beautiful girlfriend and is extremely successful, that is, until Raymond comes into his life. When Charlie's father dies he leaves Charlie his car and his award winning rose bushes. The three million dollar house, however, goes to a brother who Charlie knows nothing of, apart from the fact that he is in a mental institution. When Charlie visits the institution he argues with the warden about Raymond's fortune, and questions Raymond's ability to take on this great asset. When the warden refuses to recommend any change, Charlie kidnaps his brother, and takes him under his care.This damages Charlie's relationship with his girlfriend, Susanna, and his job. He soon begins to blame his misfortunes on Raymond, which is not always incorrect. When Raymond refuses to go out in the rain, Charlie is left stranded, unable to reach a destination, required for his job. I hope you appreciate this because my business is going down the f***ing toilet. Raymond has a rare form of autism, which makes him able to perform massive and complicated mathematical problems in his head. He also has a fantastic memory. However, this condition also has its negative affects. He has trouble relating with people. When kissed by a prostitute in Las Vegas, he says that the kiss felt wet. He has difficulty making decisions and does everything he is told. When crossing a road, the light flashes 'Don't Walk'. Raymond immediately stops walking in the middle of the road. He is asked whether he wants to go back to Walbrook (his mental institution) or go with Charlie, and responds Go back to Walbrook, stay with Charlie Babbitt. As well as these, Raymond has countless fears, becomes highly distressed in basic conflict situations and when he cannot watch his television programs at the right time.Perhaps the basic negative aspect of Raymond's disorder is his 'twisted vista' on life. He can do great mathematical equations, but struggles when asked basic life problems, involving things such as money. Everything he seems to do is vague and he does not respond to body language, only words. It is later revealed that Raymond cared for Charlie when he was very young, but once accidentally burnt Charlie in the bath and was sent away. It was during this time Charlie called him 'Rain Man' and this is where the film gets its name. This care is inverted when the pair meets up later in life, and Charlie finds it difficult to take this care on.However, what separated the pair is also what brings them back together. Charlie takes Raymond to Las Vegas and uses his extraordinary mathematics skills to 'count cards' in a game of Blackjack. They win masses of money, and, although Charlie is 'using' Raymond, this trip brings them closer together. Charlie becomes a great carer, and begins to show great affection to his older brother. What you have to understand is, four days ago he was only my brother in name. And this morning we had pancakes. Charlie begins to see that it is better for Raymond to send him to the institution. So, Charlie gives Raymond perhaps the first major choice he has had in decades. He sends Raymond back to Walbrook for two weeks, and tells him he can come back if he wants to. We have seen though, that this may be the end of Raymond's trip, as he is so indecisive that this may be the last time he is outside the institution.

In actual fact, there's not a lot in it; but this film deserves more credit for having the original idea, and it has to be said that the idea is a good one as this film carries off it's central theme and plot in style, and the two blend excellently to create a compelling and intriguing psychological portrait of both a criminal and the effects of not getting enough sleep. The film carries off an excellent reversal in the common psychological theme, in that this time; it's the daylight that causes all the horrors. Insomnia takes place in Norway where, for one half of the year it's light and the other half it's dark. It's currently light, and detective Jonas Engström has been assigned to a case involving a murdered girl. The plot thickens when the detective accidentally shoots his partner whilst chasing the killer, and then proceeds to cover up the murder he has committed while the search for the girl's murderer continues.The American remake adheres to the plot of the original rather closely, and that's a shame for someone like me who has seen the remake as I always knew what was going to happen next. But even so, while the plot didn't contain any surprises for me; watching the detective's descent into insanity owing to his insomnia makes for a great watch, and the as the plotting is expertly handled by director Erik Skjoldbjærg, watching it play out is always a pleasure. Stellan Skarsgård takes the lead role, and while he may not have the star power of Al Pacino, he manages to deliver a darker and all the more believable performance as the put-upon policeman at the centre of the tale. In fact, all the ensemble cast comes together well and the film feels very much like an A-class production at all times. Insomnia features a number of memorable scenes that help to ensure that the audience will remember it beyond just its central ideas; and overall, it's clear that the writing team have succeeded in making a film that transcends its cat and mouse formula.

Robert Freddy Krueger Englund plays a creepy psychology professor. Brad Dourif, the voice of Chucky in the Childsplay films, makes a brief appearance as the stuttering proprietor of a gas station. Finally Danielle Harris, Jamie Lloyd in Halloween 4&5, plays Tosh, Natalie's goth roommate.The death scenes are gruesome and imaginative. The gore isn't OTT because the story is strong enough that it doesn't need to be - a couple of the death scenes are left up to the imagination of the viewer, which is perhaps even worse than actually seeing them. Finally, when the killer is revealed, the motive is interesting and there's a nice twist (or two) right at the end.Definitely worth either renting or buying if you're looking out for the best of 90's horror. ","genre":"Horror, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"13 September 2006","score":"","review":" Having been created during one of director Hitchcock's most fertile periods, this is, as screenwriter Lehman put it, The Hitchcock picture to end all Hitchcock pictures. The movie throws in virtually all of the legendary director's favorite types of cinematic trademarks from his own walk-on role, a man wrongly accused, an icy blonde who may be dangerous, action sequences taking place in unusual locales and a MacGuffin, to name only a few. Grant plays an ad executive who happens to attract the attention of two henchmen who mistake him for a government spy. They kidnap him and try to extract info from him. Once they realize they've chosen the wrong man, they try to kill him, but he slips away, only to come back the next day with heated accusations. Rather than let the matter rest, he starts to investigate the situation which quickly becomes deadly for him and for others. He sets out on a cross-country jaunt from New York City to Mount Rushmore with both the police and the villains nipping at his heels. Grant provides a typically charming and suave portrayal. He deftly pendulums from serious concern to humor to romance. Supplying the romance is Saint as a sexy, mysterious woman he meets on a train. She does an excellent job of portraying her character's inner turmoil as well as the light sarcasm that goes with her sophisticated persona (though it's more than a little ridiculous when she states her age as 26. She was nearly a decade past that.) The chief bad guy is Mason, in a laid-back and coolly above-it-all type of performance. He's menacing, but never breaks a sweat, preferring to let his sidekicks take care of the dirty work. His primary sidekick is Landau, who can be perceived as (and was intended to be displayed as) a homosexual, though the suggestion is fairly subtle. Landis, only several years older than Grant in real life, plays his mother in an amusing turn. Other notable cast members include the sturdy Carroll, who worked with Hitchcock in more films than anyone else, and Lang, who would later go on to rage at Tippi Hedren in The Birds. Hutchison, best known for her role in Harvey plays a rather dubious mistress of the house where Grant is held and General Hospital's Beradino plays a cop who picks up Grant for drunk driving. The film gets off to a smashing start with the captivatingly cacophonous score by Bernard Herrman and, while long, rarely lets up in its trek from one scenario to the next. Nearly all of the set pieces are memorable, if not legendary, including the trip to the United Nations, the corn field conflagration and most importantly the chase up and down the faces of Mount Rushmore. Here Hitch indulges in another one of his favorite touches, having Saint lose piece after piece of her striking ensemble and becoming more and more disheveled. Incidentally, the director's favorite costume designer Edith Head was not part of this MGM production, leaving him without her wonderful tailoring and clean lines. He rejected the costumes offered up by the studio and purchased the bulk of Saint's wardrobe off the rack at Bergdorf-Goodman! Only one of the set pieces falls flat today and that is the drunken chase along a winding and perilous highway. Bad rear projection and some hammy close-ups from Grant render this one sequence less than perfect. However, that's quibbling when the rest of the film is so good. The ending (both the section involving the leads and the tag with the train) couldn't be more perfect.

Perhaps the most shocking and funny scene was the one in which Stanley Kowalski (Marlon Brando) beats his fist on the door and screams at his sister-in-law, Blanche Du Bois (Vivien Leigh), to get the hell out of the bathroom. She'd been living with him and her sister, Stella, for the past five months (after arriving with little warning) and by then the atmosphere in their seedy New Orleans apartment had really deteriorated. In fact, Stan could no longer stand the sight of her. Gradually, she'd elbowed her way into their humble abode at least in part by driving a wedge between Stan and Stella and interfering with his simple if obnoxious lifestyle. In defense of his home against this eccentric interloper, Stan goes about methodically destroying her. His tactics range from alarming, if amusing, to unforgivably ruthless and cruel. True, this sophisticated and refined woman is not quite what she seems, but one gets the distinct impression that what she would like to be is more or less what she really is, and certainly not the fallen woman in the tawdry history dug up by Stan in order to discredit her. As the movie progresses, one can't help but feel increasingly sorry for her and to see her as both beautiful and very sweet. By the time Stanley has exposed her shady past, she has won us over and we are willing to believe that most of his research is composed of ugly gossip, slanderous distortions, and outright lies, even though she admits to the essential details while denying the ugly interpretation given them by leaders of the Mississippi town who drove her out of their midst, or by Stan, who is more than willing to believe the worst. Of course, in seeking refuge with them, she HAS seriously imposed on the young couple, basically transforming the dump they live in from an extension of the brutal filth and white trash society just outside the door to her own special little alcove. Stan detests her influence on his wife and strongly disapproves of everything she does and stands for, perhaps represented most by the way she begins taking baths (hydrotherapy) every time she turns around. To him, this interfering old broad is a giant pain in the ass whose endless visit he can no longer tolerate. She has been a thorn in his side from the moment she showed up in New Orleans (after losing the family plantation) to the point where he cannot stomach having her around another week. So he does everything he can to take her down bit by bit (even on her birthday), slowly driving her over the brink, and finishing her off at the conclusion by raping her when his wife is in the hospital delivering their baby. He then claims she has gone completely insane and made it all up. Oddly, his white trash peers, including her own sister, dutifully circle the wagons around him and against her, helping to commit Blanche to a sanitarium in the country. In an ironic twist, the man who comes to take her away recognizes something special about her and treats her as if she really is what she has always claimed to be. Thus, she accompanies him willingly. All of this, just so Stan can be left in peace and have things the way they used to be before she showed. The handsome and muscular young Brando is such a convincing pig as the animalistic Kowalski that we can't help but wonder how much of his performance is just being himself. What's interesting is the way he turned into a sobbing little baby when his boorish behavior pulled the rug out from under even himself, driving his similarly half-wild\/half-sweet little wife upstairs to a friend's apartment.

Throw in Kim Hunter, who provokes her volatile husband by playing her sister against him, and Karl Malden as the spineless mama's boy who loves Blanche and then rejects her when Stan tells him about her past, and you have a thoroughly captivating film. In an era when depressing movies were all the rage, this one must have led the pack. I have a book about Brando by Peter Manso, in which he depicts him as Stanley Kowalski personified, only worse. It's hard to tell how much of the tome is strictly hatchet job and how much is the real man.

Gary has a creative genius unceasing, and between him and all of the people who have ever written material for the games, there was enough to put together a hundred films with separate plots and character types. The problem the general public may have is that they don't understand the rules, or character types, and thus did not relate to the story.I appreciate the producer's and director's attempt to incorporate D & D material and rules into the movie, but in doing so they have made the film unwatchable by all but fans of the game. For example, the scene with the Lich, Savril (The skeleton on the rack that gave Ripley the Rod of Savril). Who but players of the game would know what he was? Thus, who but players of the game could appreciate his inclusion? Or, as another example, the Beholders (those floating balls with one big eye in the middle and tentacles with eyes at the ends). Who but a player of D&D could have known what they were, and of what they were capable? A little demonstration of their powers (each eyestalk has a different magic ability, and the center eye reflects magic aimed upon it) would have been entertaining. Alas, we only see them float through a hallway.On the other hand, I must give credit to certain portrayals. The Dwarf is exactly how I picture a dwarf to be; battlehearty, loyal, vulgar, abrupt, fearless but with weaknesses (hates horses), and avaricious. Bravo! I also applaud the portrayal of Norda, the Elf Ranger. She is as stuck up as most elves are made out to be in the games.All in all, I enjoyed the film, but they could have done better with the CGI,the acting, and the storyline. They had the material to make an epic to give Lord Of The Rings a run for it's money, but instead chose the Almost-Straight-To-Video path.

We see the relationship between the higher society parents of today, who are far out of touch with their children, and their children. The subtle representation in this movie is seen throughout the movie and show's many of the different things brought up in the movie.The kindness of strangers reflects throughout the movie, it makes the movie progress. Each family brings him in and helps him out with only his word that he is a friend of their kids. They put him up in their house (and two of them trusted him enough to leave him alone) given only their child's name. Although focusing on the rich it even show's the poorer kindness with Rick and Elizabeth, who take him in with barely enough means to get by themselves. Ouisa shows a giant capacity for kindness when she stands up for Paul's memory at the diner party declaring it was an experience, I will not let him become an anecdote, oh that reminds me about the time that impostor came into our lives, tell me the one about the boy and again when she agree's to take him into the station so he is not treated poorly.The converse of their kindness we also see the representation of the rich peoples relationship with their children.

The Candinsky's painted on both sides The double sided painting represents life, there's two sides to everything. The painting can represent the movie, the chaos representing the chaos of those trying to find Paul and control being the control Paul shows sneaking in and out of their lives. Collage is the art form of the twentieth century- everything is somebody else's again represents life, but rather todays life opposed to a general statement about life itself. everyone is taking parts of everything else and just claiming their own.
