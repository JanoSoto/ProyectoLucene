If we regard this movie seriously, yeah, sure, a six would be enough. But it's not about serious or not, it's about fun and laughing. It exceeded my expectations in these regards. Ben Stiller has always been one of my favorite comedy actors because he's got that look on his face, a warm and friendly look, that can easily make you laugh. This certainly isn't one of his best movies, but it's a good one.minor SPOILERSIt's the world of fashion, the world of male modeling(not something I look to with much interest), the world of brainless hunks of muscles. It's our world with some tiny, tiny exaggerations. Ok...maybe not so tiny. The story is stupidly funny, this affirmation being valid for the whole movie. It's so stupid and yet so funny. I don't usually love stupid comedies, but this one is an exception, maybe because it seems to be a small universe within our world, a serious and always changing world. You can't really say that Derek's looks change too often, do they? The fact that Derek is searching to find out other things to do beside modeling, something with which he can help humanity, is hilarious through the fact that his desires are of such infantile and sincere stupidity. It's no wonder in the end that his center for children who can't read too well actually transforms into a center for the to be models. The movie is stupid, but fun. I can say that the modeling world is a world within our world and this is vividly shown in the movie. Owen Wilson plays the a little bit brighter enemy of Derek, concerning the modeling stage. Milla Jovovich plays the ferocious woman with a...remarkable name, who has to take control over Derek. She could've been a little more impressive though. This being the debut for Stiller in the directing world, it's good.

Krull's got problems.  It's a marvelously shot film. The cinematography is top notch, and the acting is also very good.  Another real plus for this film is the art direction and costuming  Again both are first class.  But despite all these positive factors the film has some shortcomings.  The problem with this film is that there're some holes in the story, and one major dissapointment with a key plot device.  If you can overcome those, that is ignore them as they appear in the film, then you should be able to enjoy Krull.  Myself, I did not enjoy Krull, so be forewarned.*** SPOILER ALERT ON ***The story problems are few, but significant.  A minor one are the bad-guys' weapons; a kind of sharpened LASER gun that doubles as a hand to hand weapon.  Which leads one to ask that if the bad buys are sophisticated with their weapons, then how is it these medieval people are giving them such a hard time?  Why are they even bothering to let them get close for hand to hand combat?  How did the bad guys get so powerful if they're so incompetent?  But like I say, that's a minor one.The real problem with the story is that it's pretty far fetched even for a fantasy story.  Most European Based Medieval Fantasy tales deal with terrestrial threats; creatures from Earth or otherwise manifested from Earth society and mythos.  In Krull we have some guy (presumably a male baddie) from outer space, that is to say he has the ability of space travel within his dark fortress, who bothers himself with a primitive world, falls in love with a female who is not of his species, and despite his power cannot manage to fully conquer a world that's stuck in the middle ages.  Is it just me, or does this just not make sense?The other problem is with the infamous Glaive.  The glaive is this spinning multi-pronged frisbee blade found, toated and used by our hero. One could call it an oversized shiruken, or Ninja Throwing star.  The concept of the weapon is not the problem, nor how its used.  The problem comes with the fact that it's used only a handful of times.  And that's a problem, because in the billing for the buildup for the film's initial theatrical release this thing was touted as being the thing\/weapon to see. Then the film rolls, and it's only used a couple of times .... and is then lost near the end of the film.  I've always hated the producers for that. Not only is it not important, not only is it only used three or four times, but then it's lost forever stuck in the gut of the antagonist.  After all the switching and baiting by the film's producers and director I say good riddance.  Too bad their careers didn't follow the glaive.The other story problem comes in with a slightly less important plot device; the Flame Mares.  It probably read well in the script Horses that go so fast flames come shooting out their hooves... or something like that. But seeing it on the screen you can't help but laugh.  Yeah, sure, it's escapist fun, but as far as escapist fun goes, for myself, the Flame Mares were about as funny as watching Joel and the robots from MST3K send up a B-movie special.  Ironically seeing the flame mares from a distance looked a whole lot more convincing than seeing the actors pretend to ride them .... another belly laugh.Two other minor problems; the cyclops character did not look convincing, but that comment's aimed at whoever did the prosthetic makeup, and not the actor underneath the mask.The final problem was the incredibly low population inhabiting this world. When the two rival kinds meet one another in the begining of the film we're led to understand that the bad guy's troops have been having a field day with these kings' armies.  Fine.  OK, so there're few troops left.  But (and this is where it gets interesting) where're all the people they're supposed to be ruling?  Where're the subjects?  One scene, in about the middle of the film, shows a collection of women attending our heros.  But it's like they appeared out of nowhere.  And contrary to the commentary on the DVD that scene doesn't make a whole lot of sense.  It's supposed to be a setup for an assasination on the lead character, but it's like these women appeared out of no where.*** SPOILER ALERT OFF ***The special effects are so-so.  The fortress\/spaceship looks convincing enough (again largely because of the good cinematography).  The LASER weapons look and sound like 80's movie versions.  And the pyrotechnics are impressive.  Some of the transformation scenes for Morgo are very lacking, but get the point across.This movie needed a clearer story concept, a reworked script, and a few more dollars for a some much needed scenes and extras.  As it stands now it's pretty laughable.  If you're a fantasy fan you might warm up to this thing, but don't say I didn't warn you.

Sadly Phantasm obIVion fails to live up to any viewers anticipation. I was expecting a lot from this movie, especially considering the long wait we had until its release! Sadly I was faced with a huge series of flashbacks from all three of the past films muddled together which gives the story no real flow. Reggie, is brilliant as always, although now, as can be expected, he looks a little older! Hmmm, maybe it's time for him to buy a new wardrobe. Maybe he doesnt get much time in his attempts to save the world from the tall Man! The movie itself, though lacking in the strength of installments one two and three has redeeming features. The lovable killer The Tall Man is seen in a different light, serving lemonade if ever it were possible! There are also some fun scenes including Reggies run in with a cop and yet another of his romances ending in failure! Mentioning this a certain female character in the film does seem to have no real use, coming in for 30 mins then being killed off.In all this is a worthwhile movie to check out if your a fan of the Phantasm series.

Sometimes I wonder if he sits up at night and makes wishes on shooting stars, asking that he be transported to the 1980's where everything was rosy and right with the world (and his career). Because, as we all know, these past couple of years have not been good for the iconic comedian. Showtime tanked, I Spy tanked (mostly because it was a film adaptation of a show that no one remembered and was a poor rip-off of Owen Wilson's own Shanghai franchise), The Holy Man tanked, Daddy Day Care made money but was ripped to shreds by critics, and his only major success came with the release of Dreamworks' animated smash Shrek. But every actor has that one movie that they would like to forget, the one humiliating bomb that is the equivalent of a mutant cousin hiding in the basement, ready to rear its ugly, pillow shaped head at any moment. For Eddie, the deformed relative is The Adventures of Pluto Nash, which is now infamous for losing the most money of any feature film in history. I think the final cost of the film was in the ballpark of $90 million, but it was held from release for over two years before being quietly presented and withdrawn from theaters. The film's total gross? A paltry $2 million or so. Yeesh, talk about a giant misstep. Of course, being the bad movie patron that I am, I heard all about this movie's history, but didn't bother to investigate the actual film until yesterday, when I spotted a VHS copy at a Blockbuster Video sale for like three bucks. Surprisingly, and I say this without having seen Showtime or I Spy, this is not the worst movie Eddie has starred in, at least in my opinion. Sure the comedy is pretty stale, and Eddie is just going through the motions as Pluto Nash, but in the end my one question is why this had to take place on the moon. Aside from a handful of elements, there was no need for this movie to be set in space. The story has less to do with something about the moon and more about Godfather-type gangsters. It could have just as easily taken place on Earth in the future, in my opinion, and the filmmakers could have saved a nice chunk of cash in the process. And while the story is kind of yawn-inducing, the surprise twist had me groaning. Let me paint the picture here There's an episode of the hilarious show Family Guy where the main character Peter reminisces about the time his wife Louis killed his evil twin. Louis is then shown aiming a pistol at two Peters, both of which are saying stuff like, Shoot him, Louis! I'm the real Peter! and, Louis, don't you know your own husband? Shoot him! The joke was great because it captured an archaic movie cliche so perfectly, so it really made me wince to see such an old device being used in Pluto Nash. There is actually a point in the film where Eddie and his evil clone are trying to convince someone to shoot their opponent. I'm the real Pluto Nash! Shoot him! No, he's lieing! Don't shoot me, he's the clone! Oh brother! And is it just me, or do all of the futuristic landscapes and gizmos look like somethin out of Back To The Future Part II? Considering that movie came out over 10 years ago, this is not a good thing. But like I said before, this isn't at all painful to watch and goes by pretty fast for a mob movie set IN SPACE.

There are no characters in this movie, only a motley group of cardboard cutouts. These characters merely serve the plot. I do not care about any of them either, except I was wondering why Liv Tyler would subvert her acting talent in her thankless role.The plot is about saving the world from doom; however, one can not possibly take this movie seriously. It is 2 and a half hours of one climax after another, like one long movie trailer. It overwhelms you, like watching a few hours of explosions in an IMAX theater would, both visually and audibly. If saving the world was really on the line, wouldn't we want the smartest and the most capable people up there? (Remember, the movie opens with Willis, the leader, recklessly wielding a gun; this act is repeated later by another actor yet). This movie did nothing to convince me that Bruce Willis and his boys could do the job to begin with, much less better than anyone else.The script is full of annoying asides and wisecracks that we expect to find in a Bond movie. Here they're out of place and annoying, if we're supposed to take the seriousness of the threat of the end of the world. Maybe that wasn't the intention. The movie was incredibly formulaic for such a long movie. I was able to predict many of the plot turns long before they occurred because of that. The movie's breakneck pace was off-putting too, racing from one special effects scene to the next. However, the special effects were pretty good I must admit. Many of the musical bridges were annoying; because, they were too loud and muffled the dialog. Some of the songs had little to do with the scene they were used in, like Sweet Emotion for instance. It was one big, dumb, long, loud, empty-headed, extremely shallow music video, like many one finds on MTV. It might have worked better as camp, with Aerosmith playing on the asteroid perhaps. After a promising start, the movie just seemed to fade away and become more routine (formulaic) with each passing minute, despite the intensity of some isolated scenes. After the movie, we are treated to the Aerosmith video of the complete version of the Oscar-nominated song, which lost to When You Believe from Prince Of Egypt. ** of 4 stars.

If they had a bomb up their sleeve now was the time to drop it and shrink their popularity bubble to a manageable size. So in that great cosmic sense of balance one can forgive the completely pedestrian effort that is Me, Myself and Irene.The basic premise of the film is an interesting one a cop with a made-up variation of schizophrenia duels with the good and evil sides of him as they both pursue one women. Premise check. I've always said the Farrelly brothers were better storytellers than joke-makers. Their movies often force laughter out of the sheer exuberance and good will of the tone, but I really watch to see where they will take an interesting and original idea.  As a star vehicle no better actor could pull this off than Jim Carrey. The entire movie is like the court bathroom scene from Liar, Liar in which he throws himself around as if he's being beat up by a ghost. Carrey has given both Charlie (good cop) and Hank (the bad cop) distinct personalities and mannerisms. When he changes from one to the next it is seamless and a complete top to bottom transformation. Great work.  In fact, his work as Hank ranks as one of the best acting jobs the guy has ever done. His all-to-brief moments as the bad cop find Carrey at the hight of his cool deadpan delivery and impeccable comic timing.  In the 3rd act when the two personalities finally meet and duke it out over control of Charlie's body it is a tour de force of physical comedy that, while not necessarily funny, reminds us we are seeing one of the most gifted comedians of our time. Next to him is damsel in distress Renee Zellwegger with her puckered-up lips and midriff. Casting and cute leading lady check.After that we run into problems. As fascinating as it is to watch Carrey and Zellwegger, the movie takes it's premise and squashes is into a simple run-from-the-bad-guys action\/comedy\/road trip\/mobster flick.  Those moments of seeing Carrey do his thing are surrounded by long, dead patches of exposition and poorly executed jokes on lame stationary targets. Rumor has it that this was an early Farrelly brother script that they pulled out of a drawer and blew mothballs off after the success of 'Mary'.  Not surprising, because the film is written and gags are executed as if we've never seen this stuff before. But it's not necessarily the script that's the problems - some lines are quite good - it's the sheer shoddy direction of the Farrelly brothers that sap out any comedic potential. In one rudimentary joke, Irene walks in on Charlie as he lays in bed with her picture on the other pillow - the camera pans over to the bottle of hand lotion on the dresser and we see Irene's reaction (over and over). While the Farrelly's are not exactly masters of subtlety they have been able to stage similar gags (as the masturbation scene in 'Mary') with far more inventiveness than this. The jokes are so tired, old and delivered at such a base level that it is almost painful to watch at times. As such, Irene never achieves the gross-out comedy status it aims for. A gross-out comedy seeks to shock us with it's excesses, but Irene  just  gutlessly retraces mined-out gags. It feels it can just show us something and get a laugh without any comedic effort.It does have it's moments such as Carrey's 3 big constantly bickering black sons, a narrator straight out of a Disney film strip or a post-coital trip to the bathroom so brilliantly executed it belongs in a different movie. A few chuckles do pop up here and there -  so out of place with the idiocy of the rest of the movie it is undoubtedly improving from Carrey (as when he asks a pair of butched-out lesbians How's it hangin' fellas). However, any inspired moment is quickly interrupted by a shootout, a scene of Chris Cooper's corrupt lieutenant conspiring or something else the brothers are using to pad this lousy plot. Even in the lamest of Farrelly brother comedies there has always been a sweet natured backbone to the proceedings. Not only is that lacking here , but Me, Myself & Irene is actively mean-spirited - particularly to it's lovable goof Charlie.The Farrelly brothers normally get laughs from the many oddball characters and situations they throw into every angle of their films. In this movie just as many plates are spinning in the air, but they seem to have forgotten how to deliver on the gags. By shackling the stars down to this ridiculous storyline it seems like they don't have faith in the talents of Carrey and Zellwegger or don't know that just letting them vamp off each other (as Carrey and Jeff Daniels did in 'Dumb and Dumber') could have driven this movie without the aid of an artificial studio plot. Shame too, it could have been great. Me, Myself & Irene is a great idea so poorly done it is a good candidate to be ripped up and remade (or turned into a sitcom) in a few decades.

The screen lights up whenever Jackson enters as Beth and Pat Cappadora's oldest son Vincent. You can feel the torment in that adolescent body. Why the heck is it so hard for his parent to understand him?If you like the Vincent character I can recommend you to read the book by Jacquelyn Mitchard. It's about as sentimental as the movie (if not more) but interesting in the way that it is told through a shared view, with both Beth and Vincent narrating the story. In the book we learn a lot more about Vincent and his life, why he became who he is and what he thinks and feel about the whole situation. Most of the time seen from Vincent's view is spent at his psychiatrist Tom, a character they completely cut out of the movie. That's too bad, because that's where all the action really takes place. Vincent is a really messed up kid, and the scenes between him and Tom are both funny and thoughtful.In the book Vincent also suffers from panic attacks, something experienced by many teens and that could have been used in the movie as a good identification issue. Sadly, that was cut out too. Basically, what they have done is taken what is in the book a multilayered and very interesting character, and turned him one-dimensional and less inspiring. What we can be thankful for is Jonathan Jackson who I think does a great job with the little he is given. Ryan Merriman, who plays the lost son Ben\/Sam is also very good.But otherwise this movie seems like a made-for-TV-sleeze-thing and I can't stand the bad acting put up by the adults. Michelle Pfeiffer can be really good in roles that are more toned down than this one and her overacting everything is annoying. Treat Williams is mostly just vacant. Whoopi Goldberg on the other side does a fine job as a minority within the majority a black, lesbian cop that befriends the family. Basically you can get a lot out of reading the book if you just skip the parts about Beth.

This movie is not supposed to be taken seriously. From the opening big wind  shot its obvious that we are in a hyper-real world. Richard Gere's character hasn't done anything to warrant putting him in the kind of situation he finds himself in. He's a nice guy  who cares about his family. Diane Lane is having a fling. Why ? Who knows? I guess she's caught up in the moment. The third act is when the black comedy aspects come into play. Gere leaves as much evidence as he destroys and on top of everything else puts the corpse in the trunk of his car and then , apparently, dumps it in the town dump in his own hometown  miles away from the crime scene. On top of everything else he and the arcass get stuck in the elevator which should be a big tip off that we're not in the real world. Yes, the ending is a cheat and ambiguous but it really isn't. Watch the scenes with the NYPD homicide detectives closely. They aren't dummies and its obvious they are on to something. Based on the time line even with an ambigous ending its obvious these guys are coming back, probably on New Years Eve and Gere is going to be arrested. He's their suspect. They've got all kinds of evidence and from the moment they enter the picture its apparent they aren't just fishing. They know what happened here. Director Adrian Lyne just doesn't show it to the viewer but his detectives know who committed this murder. They know it from that first visit.

I had no idea that after the crash things would go so dreamlike and strange. I am glad I hadn't read too much about the plot as it would have ruined the entire film just like if you already knew the ending to The Others or The Sixth Sense.I really enjoyed this movie, it was disjointed and confusing in places but this all kind of makes sense at the end when you discover most of the film was a lucid dream. The idea that Cruises character had ruined everything by getting in the car with Diaz was a little tragic. At the nightclub when things start going wrong you can't help but feel a little sorry for him, as his brain has been affected too, and he ends up pushing away the only woman he's ever cared for. I found the story gripping and I never quite knew what was happening. My thoughts would be changing every other scene as I first thought he was being tricked so the board could get rid of him, then I thought maybe he HAS killed someone because he's going mad, then finally it all became clear. There were some great performances from the cast which helped move the far-fetched plot along. A special mention must go to the soundtrack too, which i thought was perfectly suited and helped bring out the emotion in the film.I would recommend everyone watches this film at least once, it's the kind of film you have to see for yourself. If I had gone on other peoples opinions I would never have seen it and I personally found it ultimately moving. This movie has the ability to really touch you or leave you cold, depending on what kind of person you are. Go see it.
