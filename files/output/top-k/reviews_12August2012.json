From what I have noticed, there are three types of horror movies that seem to come out from Hollywood the supernatural nasties, the serial killers, and Stephen King Horror movies. The supernatural nasty style are generally quite lame (The Gate, Ghoulies, Poltergeist), the serial killer is over done (Urban Legends, and I include Freddies Nightmares in here as well), and the Stephen King horror movies seem to fall into a category of their own. There are also disturbing movies, but these are far from being horror, and very few of them come from Hollywood.In 1962 (or thereabouts) a young boy brutally murders his sister and is locked up. In 1979 the boy escapes from gaol. He has been basically locked up because he is seen as a threat to society, but somebody locked up simply because of that is liable to generate a deep resentment to society and become a threat to society. The film simply says that he is inherently evil and should be locked away. This is something I do not agree with because firstly everybody is inherently evil, and secondly such a nasty person will still have a redeemable side. To add to this, this character seems to be able to resist quite a lot to damage, including a knife in the neck and bullets in the chest.Recently we were discussing the idea of my friend's shadow. He claims to have this shadow that tells him to do all these rather nasty things. Our opinion is that this is something that everybody experiences, and some (a very few number) actually listen to these sickening thoughts and perform them. Most of us are able to dismiss them as stupid, and some become disturbed because they believe that they have a mental disorder, and believe that they must be different from the rest of the world. Yes, they are different because the rest of the world generally ignores these thoughts.Anyway, this is how I would view the bad guy in this movie. He is simply a perverse individual that thinks the sickening thoughts that run through his head are in fact a good idea, and follows him. We would like to deny that such thoughts exist, but it is part of our human nature. We are a fallen and nasty people who choose to ignore God, and by doing that, all sorts of perverse thoughts cross through our mind.Another thing that strikes me with this movie is that it is in a small town. This may be stereotypical, but it is surprisingly real life. The reason I say that is because the most disturbing things seem to happen in small towns. It is not because country people are more perverse that city people, but because of the smaller population, the chances of something really bad happening is much smaller, so when it does, it seems doubly horrific. Thus comes the comment of how could such a horrid thing happen in a place like this - and my answer is easily - some humans are sick and perverse individuals. Some of us are able to control our animal urges, others of us cannot, and a small number let them over come them and devour their sense of reason.Finally there is the idea of the bogeyman. It sounds childish and stupid, but remember that when one is a child, the bogeyman is not at all stupid. In fact he is quite intimidating. This is the feeling that we have in us that something is just hiding around the corner ready to destroy us. There are two aspects to this that I wish to draw out, not that they are really connected with the movie. The first is that we are truly not safe. No matter where we go, there are perverse and stupid individuals that can and will harm us. Then there is the natural order, in its groans to call that Christ returns, rises up and destroys us. Those of us that believe that we are safe, truly live with a false sense of security.Secondly, there is somebody waiting around the corner ready to confront us. This is not a sick or perverse individual, but God himself. God is not hiding from us though, we simply chose to pretend that he is not around. God knows everything that we have done and is preparing to judge us according to our sins. One must remember that pay off a sin with a good deed simply doesn't work, and even if it did, in general our sinful deeds far outweigh our good deeds. And omissions to act do count as sins in God's eyes, and even if we are the most perfect person in the world, if we do not acknowledge God as the supreme ruler of the universe, then that is sin because we have rejected God. The only way that our sins can be ignored, is if we allow Jesus to take our place. By doing that, we have no fear of judgment because when God goes to look at our sins, all he sees is the perfect life of Jesus Christ.

Time Bandits might be the oddest film ever intended for family audiences. Only the writer\/director's second non-Monty Python film after 1977's Jabberwocky, Gilliam infuses purposefully odd humor and nonsensical characters and events in this smorgasbord of an epic.Kevin (Craig Warnock) is an imaginative young boy whose parents are obsessed with As Seen on TV-style kitchen appliances and other material objects, but he doesn't have to worry about them for long when a band of dwarfs climb out of his wardrobe and whisk him away on an adventure throughout time in search of treasure.The dwarfs are not all that different from Kevin's parents; they seek only to amass treasure despite being in possession of a map that shows all the world's time holes, Kevin sees this as a quite a waste of a gift, but there's not much he can do &#x97; and it beats being at home. The five dwarfs, Randall (David Rappaport), Fidgit (Kenny Baker, a.k.a. R2-D2), Strutter (Malcolm Dixon), Og (Mike Edmonds) and Wally (Jack Purvis) are a delightful bunch. Gilliam shoots the film at their level, and you really see them for their acting ability, not simply their stature.Complicating their journey from Napoleon France to the Middle Ages to Ancient Greece and beyond is that they're being pursued by the Wizard of Oz-like Supreme Being, a sort of euphemism for God, who wants his map back, while the Evil Genius (David Warner) tries to lure them to his Fortress of Ultimate Darkness to steal the map and recreate the world in his own evil image. Evil Genius is an extreme caricature of the force of evil equipped with a bizarre bent only Gilliam seems truly capable of.Whatever statements Gilliam and co-writer Michael Palin wish to make about God\/Satan or good\/evil get lost fairly quickly in the countless strange events that occur in each of the journey's pit stops. After sinking with the Titanic, they get caught in an ogre's fishing net only the ogre has back pains that distract him from being menacing. In moments like those the film feels as its most Python.Although we're only peppered with the humor of Time Bandits, Gilliam's imagination never lags for even a moment. He undoubtedly proves himself a man of tremendous vision, even though a child would be more likely to be terrified of it than appreciate its combination of dark and eccentric.Time Bandits is truly an adventure to behold. The journey of its hero plays second fiddle, but there's enough swirling metaphor and symbolism for the child's imagination going on that we understand what he's going through and identify with it personally. The ending does but another weird cap on things, but it gels with the unexpected nature of most everything else in the film.Gilliam embraces fantasy and historical fantasy archetypes with a fervor nearly equal to his desire to chop them into weirdly shaped pieces before serving them to us. Time Bandits is consequently as familiar as it is spontaneous and silly. Although not the staple of its genre, it certainly must be described as timeless.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Time Bandits might be the oddest film ever intended for family audiences. Only the writer\/director's second non-Monty Python film after 1977's Jabberwocky, Gilliam infuses purposefully odd humor and nonsensical characters and events in this smorgasbord of an epic.Kevin (Craig Warnock) is an imaginative young boy whose parents are obsessed with As Seen on TV-style kitchen appliances and other material objects, but he doesn't have to worry about them for long when a band of dwarfs climb out of his wardrobe and whisk him away on an adventure throughout time in search of treasure.The dwarfs are not all that different from Kevin's parents; they seek only to amass treasure despite being in possession of a map that shows all the world's time holes, Kevin sees this as a quite a waste of a gift, but there's not much he can do &#x97; and it beats being at home. The five dwarfs, Randall (David Rappaport), Fidgit (Kenny Baker, a.k.a. R2-D2), Strutter (Malcolm Dixon), Og (Mike Edmonds) and Wally (Jack Purvis) are a delightful bunch. Gilliam shoots the film at their level, and you really see them for their acting ability, not simply their stature.Complicating their journey from Napoleon France to the Middle Ages to Ancient Greece and beyond is that they're being pursued by the Wizard of Oz-like Supreme Being, a sort of euphemism for God, who wants his map back, while the Evil Genius (David Warner) tries to lure them to his Fortress of Ultimate Darkness to steal the map and recreate the world in his own evil image. Evil Genius is an extreme caricature of the force of evil equipped with a bizarre bent only Gilliam seems truly capable of.Whatever statements Gilliam and co-writer Michael Palin wish to make about God\/Satan or good\/evil get lost fairly quickly in the countless strange events that occur in each of the journey's pit stops. After sinking with the Titanic, they get caught in an ogre's fishing net only the ogre has back pains that distract him from being menacing. In moments like those the film feels as its most Python.Although we're only peppered with the humor of Time Bandits, Gilliam's imagination never lags for even a moment.

Harry's car is hemmed in on the highway and three or four machine-gun-toting gangsters puncture his car with a thousand bullets. Finally, silence. The vehicle lies there, smoking and shattered. One of the goons walks over carefully to the wreck to make sure Harry is in the same shape as his car. Harry pops up out of the door and shoots him in the face. Then he shoots the remaining goons while they desperately fill the air with lead.Machine guns can't kill Dirty Harry. Sound absurd? Here's another instance. Harry and his blond Boswell are descending in one of those outside elevators and another squad of thugs unloose a fusillade of slugs, turning the now immobile elevator into a spaghetti colander. It's no use. Harry and the ambitious blond has escaped simply by lying on the floor and when the elevator door opens they slither out.The best thing about these scenes is that they have nothing to do with what appears to be the main plot -- the dead pool that has celebrities listed and bet on according to the order of their deaths. I know what a boat pool is. But the dead pool is never explained. That doesn't matter, though, because, as I say, it has nothing to do with the murder that precipitates the action.It's not worth going on about the film for long.

Why hadn't I heard of it, what was wrong with it.Nothing - except it's more a filmed play than a film, with almost all the talky dialogue taking place in a dusty old New York junk shop. Dustin Hoffman is superb, mixing a florid torrent of irrelevant comment, swearing and unease that is not a far cry from his brilliant turns in Rain Main and Midnight Cowboy. Dennis Franz, meanwhile is the shop's proprietor and is an almost opposite, a masterclass in understated body language as the rants from Teach (Hoffman) have become like water off a duck's back.A third character, black youth Sean Nelson is the dog's body of the outfit and has his own agendas to deal with. The U.S coin of the title is one that might be worth a lot of money, or is it? Having sold it for more than they thought it worth, do they steal it back, just in case it's worth thousands?Mamet's dialogue crackles with a crisp reality - Teach swears like a trooper, with F and C swear words jumbled up along with everything else. He's harmless, you conclude, if not obviously emotionally damaged. Donny, (Franz) says as much and as little as most shopkeepers say; only when it's needed to get a deal done; to clarify a point.It undoubtedly would have had more impact and urgency within the confines of a set in an actual theatre, but on DVD it's OK. The shop, at least looks like a proper shop with a plethora of junk, the clutter adding to the feeling of messed up lives, somehow.Sadly, this won't appeal to everyone. There's no real action to speak of, no pretty women to break up the squalid male-ness and like Teach's dialogue, the story goes round in circles.

The first hour and 25 minutes of this 2 hour 10 minute film are incredibly, almost inconceivably, boring and consist mostly of close ups of James Stewart's face while he silently drives around tailing a delusional, deranged woman.At this point of the movie the story seems to be about a woman who thinks she was someone who died 200 years earlier in a past life. Watching this stage of the film is a profoundly boring experience and is an astonishing 75% of the movie! The characters, the situations they find themselves in and especially the dialog, everything about that first 85 minutes in fact, is so bland and boring it's hard to sit through it. After 45 minutes of James Stewart looking in his rear view mirror and mugging to the camera you need serious commitment not to abandon ship.Oddly for Hitchcock, the problem is that there is simply a complete lack of suspense. We simply don't care that she thinks she is a reincarnated woman from the 1790's because that storyline doesn't seem to be going anywhere in particular as the only explanation is that the character is insane, so it isn't interesting to watch James Stewart follow her around and watch her run her delusional errandsThe last 35 minutes, from the (deservedly) famous dream sequence onward are compelling. I didn't see that twist coming and anyone who says they did (as a few reviewers claim) is lying. Incidentally, the so called plot holes are easily explained away with any number of possible explanations.For the first time there is something interesting going on. Where before the dialog consisted of banal exchanges between Stewart and Barbara Bel Geddes that simply padded out the movie and served to advance the plot by letting the viewer know what was going on (without being the slightest bit entertaining), there is a real sense of gripping drama in every exchange as Stewart the mentally fragile retired detective puts it all together and Kim Novak tries to have her cake and eat it, and almost succeeds.I give the first hour and 25 minutes 1 star because it is one of the most tortuously boring sequences anyone has ever bothered capturing on film, and the last 35 minutes 10 stars out 10, averaging the overall score out to 5 stars out of 10. If the first part of the movie was just pruned to perhaps 25 minutes long, or if it had simply been done in a more interesting way, it could have put this movie into an entirely different league.The reason this movie is so overrated (as a whole, notwithstanding it's incredibly powerful final 35 minutes) is simply because as it was unavailable for 30 years from the end of it's original cinematic release until 1986, it's legend grew and grew and it became trendy. The incredibly inaccessible nature of the first 85 minutes appealed to certain types of superficial people we all know.

Though by 2000 this would have appealed to the aging mid 20-somethings that had failed out of college 5 times and had returned to college still spotting the homely hair styles from 1995. This film would appeal to them as they spend a night out at the movie theater desperate to pretend that it's still their earlier college years from the previous decade. It must be hard for those actors after all this time to come to the hideous realization that not only did their acting stink but their outrageously crappy hair styles are now immortalized forever on film. Those puke looking bangs and shaved up tight necklines that shape their heads like some sort of melting-penis phallic symbols is now an immortal embarrassment for them. Their bad & outdated taste in both clothing and hair styles for 2000 is a tribute and exasperation of the films terrible writing, plot, and half backed development. Even if I didn't spend that much time criticizing the god awful hair styles it is a symbol of the ignorant and out of of ideas writing for the time. Heck even by 1999 there were fantastic films being made like The Matrix. Times were changing from music to clothing styles, from hair styles to shoes. But this movie lingers like one of those old moldy hot dogs at a corner store rotisserie that no one wants anymore because it's past it's prime yet remains past it's expiration date. Not judged simply because it's old or out of date but it is now without flavor, devoid of any nutrition or value of any kind, and the simple site of looking at it will make you feel sick even without ingesting it. The title of this movie is meant to be self explanatory but is also rather Ironic.

I mean, I just watched it, and I still don't know. I was TOLD that it was a rich snob who took a loser girl and turned her pretty and cool. Now, it was easy to tell where it would go, and end up, but I still thought it would be a nice waste of time. Boy was I wrong. Firstly, the acting was so terrible. It really made me feel ill. Every time the lead role opened her annoying lopsided mouth I wanted to go over to 1995, and shut her trap with duct tape. Everything she had to say was so 'every note in the scale'. Her voice went up and down in a way that made you want to rip her voice box out. Not to mention she was as stupid as all get out. How do you relate to a character who if you looked at her at the right moment you would probably catch drooling on the desk. The only good actors were Paul Rudd (as always) and the lead's dad, (for some reason. He barely had any lines, he was just the only other convincing role)The second thing was their god awful clothing. If you haven't seen this film, I literally cannot describe the clothing. Whether they look really rich or not, their clothing is just..... I don't know. It's like they're all dressed up for Halloween or something? It's truly mental! Then, there was the plasters. There are people with plastic surgery bandages on their faces everywhere. Eventually you think to yourself, 'Okay, I get that their in California, but not EVERYONE is as fake as the hideous main character!'And of course, we now come to the worst part. The plot. Or plots. Or, string of random events (if you can call them that) stuck together into an hour and a half composition of boredom. So, first she fixes this girl up, then she disappears, then she goes to a party where they all do drugs, then she gets sexually harassed, then held at gunpoint (something which she never notifies her dad or the police about for some bizarre reason which we aren't told) and then she goes to a disco, with a guy who turns out to be gay, then her ex-stepbrother starts to love her (SERIOUSLY, this ACTUALLY HAPPENS. I mean, if this were brought to court it would probably be listed of incest of SOME description, right? I mean, even if they aren't anymore, one would still 'always think of him as a brother' yeah? It's so.... creepy). Then her friends are all screaming because they drove onto a freeway (you're probably wondering 'why are they screaming?' I will ask myself that question every day until I die. WHY WERE THEY SCREAMING? THEY WERE DRIVING!) So then she can't believe she failed her driver's test, after crashing the car into another car... And then the girl from the beginning shows up, and she's popular, (oh, and we're expected to believe that this main character girl was popular too - even though she had... one.....two friends at the beginning of the movie!) and for some reason she thinks that this other girl doesn't deserve to be popular and she tries to drop herself into conversation by going all 'Well when I was held at gun point-' and being all offended when people ignore her. I'M SORRY LADY, YOU JUST SAT DOWN AND PEOPLE ARE LISTENING TO SOMEONE ELSE FOR JUST ONE SECOND! And then she thinks for some reason she needs to change the 'error of her ways' (?) and gives all her stuff to charity.... yet I still feel she's just as twisted, spoilt and arrogant as she was when the movie began. Mostly because she thinks that everyone would give their left arm to have HER of all people, to attend their lowly skateboard tournament. WHAT AN HONOUR QUEEN MAIN CHARACTER (I can't be bothered to hit the back button and learn her name)Then there's the whole thing about the entire cast is in their twenties and they're playing fifteen year olds (who act like anything BUT fifteen. I've never seen people my age look, dress or act ANYTHING LIKE THAT). And none of the characters were believable. They all seemed to develop a boring one dimensional character for the full movie (I say full, with so many random plot lines, most characters probably got 2 minutes collectively on screen.) But then suddenly they'd say or do something totally out of character, which was weird. Probably some failure of a technique they used to try and make everyone a little 'deep'er. And there was this thing (which I think may have been something they tried to make the 'special' kind of thing with the main character where she 'can argue her way out of anything' - though this talent isn't explored at all. I think she says something along the lines of it twice and then she talks about it as if it's her catchphrase. OH and of course, how could I forget? We get to see the 'fantastic' lead french her ex-stepbrother right at the end. Trust me, it's french. I could go on for so much longer about it's many travesties against the film community but I'm bored of thinking about it. Oh, and one last complaint. Are we really expected to believe people would go to the new girl for sex advice? She'd obviously never slept with anyone, I don't care what the movie said. Why did lead girl drag her around to so many guys if she wasn't a virgin? She can obviously do it herself!

He had almost redeemed himself by the end, but there was a big chunk of cheese that came with it. Putting my personal feelings aside for a moment, Michael Douglas didn't do a bad job as Nick Conklin, although I felt Andy Garcia put in a better performance as Charlie Vincent.

Honourable mentions go to; Kate Capshaw as Joyce, Yûsaku Matsuda as Sato and Tomisaburô Wakayama as Sugai.Back in the eighties (& early nineties for that matter), your heroes had to be tough and uncompromising. This is what you get here, although by now it's all become a little cliché, back then it was what was expected. What you end up with is a film that looks great, thanks to Ridley Scott, but one that is also quite dated. Not to say it's not a great drama; I would love to see a modern remake of this without all the eighties cheese. Oh, I also have to mention a great musical score by Hans Zimmer, interspersed with pop songs but well worth listening to.

Over all, I did enjoy this film, once I got over my dislike of Douglas's character; it's a great drama that's well worth a look, if a little over-long (IMO), if you get the chance.SteelMonster's verdict RECOMMENDED.My Score 7.7\/10IMDb Score 6.5\/10 (based on 23,878 votes at the time of going to press).MetaScore NO DATA (Based on 0 critic reviews provided by Metacritic.com at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score 52\/100 (based on 21 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score 30\/100 'Want To See' (based on 26,792 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog Thoughts of a SteelMonster.

You are left under no illusion who the star of the show is and I have to admit I did take an instant disliking to his character at first. He had almost redeemed himself by the end, but there was a big chunk of cheese that came with it. Putting my personal feelings aside for a moment, Michael Douglas didn't do a bad job as Nick Conklin, although I felt Andy Garcia put in a better performance as Charlie Vincent. I also thought Ken Takakura did a great job as Matsumoto Masahiro. Honourable mentions go to; Kate Capshaw as Joyce, Yûsaku Matsuda as Sato and Tomisaburô Wakayama as Sugai.Back in the eighties (& early nineties for that matter), your heroes had to be tough and uncompromising. This is what you get here, although by now it's all become a little cliché, back then it was what was expected. What you end up with is a film that looks great, thanks to Ridley Scott, but one that is also quite dated.

I read on Wikipedia that this was the best Hitchcock film Hitchcock never made and I can't help but agree with that assessment. I mean, with stars like Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn, one can't help but see how perfect they are in this mashup of thriller\/comedy\/romance that Hitch so perfectly did in his heyday especially whenever Grant keeps us on our toes when guessing which side he's on. Director Stanley Donen must have either seen many of Hitch's movies in preparing or he simply had the right instinct of what to do when filming. Also loved Henry Mancini's score and the Maurice Binder credits but I really loved seeing some of the other supporting cast like that of James Coburn and George Kennedy, both of whom provided just the right amount of menace for their parts. One other player I haven't mentioned yet that I loved was also just right for his part Walter Matthau as someone Ms. Hepburn has to trust to get pertinent info from in order to move the plot along and who also provided a twist that I managed to predict but I didn't mind that I did since it also provided such an exciting climax. Add to that the perfect ending and I'll just say that I wouldn't mind seeing Charade again some day when I'm in the mood for such a pleasurable mix of genres like this one here...

It was a while until I found the true meaning of this movie. I love coming-of-age films because they just warm my heart. This movie has such emotions in it that i can barely ever say for any other movie. WONDERFUL cast, WONDERFUL writing, and WONDERFUL directing. I have to say the two people that really stole the show for me was River Phoenix and Kiefer Sutherland. They play their characters so well, and you really sometimes can relate to what they are saying. The chemistry between the two characters is PHENOMENAL. I wouldn't have any body else to play those two characters than the boys who preformed it. They were so young and it was still early in both of their careers. If I hadn't known that up front, I would have said that they had been acting for years. Again, amazing movie and it moved me to tears.
