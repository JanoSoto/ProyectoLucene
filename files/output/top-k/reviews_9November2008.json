Prior to Wag the Dog my answer would be no, but watching, and now re-watching it for a second time in the past week, this film could be watched today, watched next year, or even watched prior to the next four elections, and it would continue to feel current, real, and modern in today's political\/cinematical world. The power of the dialogue, the intense chemistry of the characters, and the constant interruption of the television generation into the political world will continue to keep Wag the Dog out of the black hole of cinema &#150; it will not be dated, never forgotten, and forever enjoyed. As we continue to allow CNN to give us our news, this film will remain as vivid as America's apple pie.Act I The Chemistry of the Characters Robert DeNiro and Dustin Hoffman could play chess for three hours, and it would capture my attention from beginning to end. DeNiro is a powerhouse of an actor, not just because he can play the tough gangster type, but also because he can take a character like Brean and give us simple, verbose, and intelligent. His range can be seen throughout this film. He commands each scene that he is in, focusing our attention on each of his words and lingering on his next move. In my eyes, it is more powerful than Goodfellas or Casino because of his subtle nature. The scene that stands out for me in Wag the Dog that requires viewing for DeNiro's talent is that between CIA Agent William H. Macy and DeNiro discussing the honesty of the war on Albania. To me, this shows the power of his talent.Jumping onto the other side of this film, there is Dustin Hoffman. While DeNiro pulls his obvious strengths with this film, Hoffman makes Wag the Dog more than just a political film. Listening to the commentary, Hoffman discusses the fact that he nearly didn't make this film because he couldn't find Motss's character. Thankfully he did, due to his compelling portrayal; we are taken from political conspiracy cinema to this raw human drama. The final act was sublime due to both DeNiro and Hoffman's chemistry, but also because we believed Motss' words. As audience members, we wanted to see him tell his story (knowing that he never would). It was the human element, the Motss' true self, that we were drawn to, and Hoffman stayed true to those moments until the very end. This isn't your typical Hollywood happy film, this basis itself on &#150; albeit conspiracies &#150; but honest conspiracies. Could you survive the greatest hoax ever and promise not to tell a soul? Surrounding these characters, we had Willie Nelson, Denis Leary, Anne Heche, Kirsten Dunst, William H. Macy, John Michael Higgins, and &#150; who could forget &#150; Woody Harrelson. These are our players, and they take us from scene to scene with the greatest of ease.Act II The Writing & the Directing David Mamet. Does anything else need to be said? Having been a full time follower of his work, I was not surprised to see that it was his quick-witted words coming from our characters' mouths. It is the fast-paced level of intellectual banter that transforms Wag the Dog into the powerhouse that it is. It works because you finish watching the characters actions and it is the words you find yourself quoting for weeks after. Mamet's political punch to this film was reminiscent of Kubrick's ideas behind Dr. Strangelove. The two were films that were absurd, but it was also the ideals that they were satirizing that makes both viewable today; just as powerful as they were when they were released. Mamet's words with Barry Levinson's direction takes Wag the Dog into perfection. There are no heroes, there are no villains, and we know so little about the characters that it is simply the story, or the words, that pull us into this film. The beats are hit, the angles are crisp and tight, and our characters are perfection &#150; possibly the best casting in years. With this in mind, we have only the third act remaining &#150; cause, as everyone knows &#150; there is always a third act! Act III The Final ThoughtOverall, Wag the Dog is perfect. Very few films in my eyes fully carry the honor of being watchable at any time, any decade, or any political year &#150; but Wag the Dog does. Watching with a group of friends, I was surprised as to how many had not seen this feature, remembering that it had been birthed nearly 11 years ago, it still seemed surprising. Wag the Dog overturns those political conspiracy theories and makes you laugh, think, and realize the impact of our commercial media. It was enjoyable to hear the current terms like plumber and commercial president in this 1997 film, boasting the truth that this film was made before its time. Looking back, there are those that could complain about our premise being too clich√©, that the same conspiracy theories have been done again and again, but to me, this was fresh. This entire film was fast-paced, amazingly acted, and media driven. In the commentary, it is talked about how it is rumored that the media doesn't even check sources any further, and this is a glowing example of that regime.Grade ***** out of ***** ","genre":null},{"date":"9 November 2008","score":"13 out of 14 people found the following review useful","review":" Can a movie created in the late 90s still speak to a voting audience in the late 2000s?

Huma Rojo's theater production of A Street Car Named Desire is in town and is struggling with her co- star\/girlfriend Nina, a coke-addict. Almodovar has a talent for taking individuals that can easily be caricatures and making them into fully fleshed out characters through their circumstances and temperaments. For example when Manuela asks Agrado is her Chanel suit is real, her answer is How could I buy a real Chanel with all the hunger in the world?While Manuela is the main character, the spirit of the film is with Agrado. There are two scenes in particular where the content of her character is prevalent. The first is her monologue in which she describes herself as real because she fixed herself to look like who she thinks she could be.

The main thing separating this picture from that forgotten direct-to-video film is that it gets a better cast and director than it really deserves. John Carpenter may not be at the top of his 'Halloween' game but he is still able to do what he has all ways done best, create a heightened sense of fear and atmosphere. Vampires does have some blood and gore but it doesn't cover the walls,it's ability to use these fun and quirky characters is the draw. James Woods is that main character, Jack Crow.

It's a very daring movie about a difficult topic that takes the story into directions that few would have dared at the time, or now. I'm not sure if in the final analysis the movie had anything important enough to say in order to justify showing the death of a child by terrorism, but I salute the director for willing to attempt it from Conrad's story.Oscar Homolka is quite a bit more handsome than I've seen him in other films, although it's interesting to note that the film features absolutely no romantic scenes or signs of affection between his character and his wife, played by the lovely and talented American actress Sylvia Sidney. Probably that's to soften the audience up for the fact that the romance, such as it is, which develops is between Sidney's character and the detective played by John Loder. Unfortunately Loder is a bit of a weak link in this triangle. He lacks screen presence and can't really elicit respect or admiration from the audience in the hero role. We're supposed to sympathize with him I think when he wants to run away to France towards the end, but the whole idea just seems idiotic. After all, considering that Homolka's character just killed her brother with a bomb and was probably going to strangle her, it would seem easy to cop a self defense plea even if juries at the time were less friendly towards wives who kill their husbands. What exactly does Ted know that nobody else knows, which motivates him to try to run? It seems fairly contrives, and doesn't really pay off the investment we've made in these characters.But the film on the whole is not bad at all. There are a handful of really excellent suspense scenes, especially the fatal bus ride and the final confrontation between husband and wife. There are also some interesting ideas floating around in the stew, such as a parallel that's set up between the movie itself and the movies that are being shown in Homolka's theater. For a moment after her brother's death, Winnie (Sidney) laughs along with the audience at a cartoon. But when one of the cartoon characters dies and everyone else in the theater breaks out in laughter, she is dead silent. What the film seems to be saying is that death or murder exist in more than one context. Early in the film there's a nice little scene where the window between their living room and the theater suddenly bursts open and you hear a woman shrieking as she's perhaps murdered. This intrusion of fantasy violence into such an apparently peaceful domestic situation mirrors the act of sabotage that puts innocent people going about their business in harm's way. It also comments on the fact that certain depictions of death can be entertaining while others (such as the death of a young boy we've come to know quite well) exist within a very different context. This separation, the space between the two contexts, is what allows someone like Homolka's character to commit such heinous crimes that are not in keeping with what he sees as his own gentle character. It's not a case that Homolka was an evil man whose wife was simply unable to see through him; perhaps he is evil, but he is not a villain. He is a human being who has become an agent of evil because he cannot see or feel the direct affects of his terrorist actions.It's a strikingly well made film, with a couple of good performances from Homolka and Sidney and a very dense suspense-oriented plot. One additional note the scene with the bomb-maker trying to fool people into thinking that mute canaries can sing by way of some kind of audio trick was clearly inspired by a similar scene with Lon Chaney in Tod Browning's film The Unholy Three. It's the only time I've ever noticed any explicit influence of Browning on Hitchcock.

","genre":"Thriller"},{"date":"9 November 2008","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" The Great Dictator is one of Charlie Chaplin's most dynamic and most entertaining films. His first speaking film, it allows him to add a level of verbal comedy and wit to his always-funny pantomime and physical comedy.Playing a dual role both as megalomaniacal dictator Adenoid Hynkel (based on Adolf Hitler) and a lowly Jewish barber from the ghetto, Chaplin, flexes his repertory performing talents to convince the viewer it could be different actors playing these roles. The barber character allows Chaplin to breathe new life into his well-known tramp character, complete with signature hat and cane. The Brahms shaving scene is so dynamic that even without a word of dialogue it stands the test of time to entertain viewers decades after its release.Much of the film's intrigue comes from its symbolism. Beginning with the double cross symbol, playing on the Nazi swastika as well as the public being double-crossed, the movie goes on to explore the notion of how, as Caesar once said, Absolute power corrupts absolutely. As Hynkel even notices when he says you make me afraid of myself! the world is not unlike the balloon prop Chaplin uses to entertain viewers; it may be fun to play with, but if you squeeze it too hard it will explode.As an added bonus, the movie explores the notion of what can happen when two men with great power but even greater egos go against each other for control of the world. Arguing over military deployment and treaty negotiation, Hynkel and Italian dictator Benzini Napaloni (based on Benito Mussolini) quarrel at a complimentary buffet, but eventually settle their differences and remain friends. This, one could say, is a strong allegory to the uselessness of war and clueless nature of those with the power to start wars.In delivering speeches in the character of Hynkel, Chaplin expresses the fire and intensity of an evil dictator while remaining absolutely ridiculous and entertaining. In preparing for his role, Chaplin spent a lot of time studying a lot of tapes of Hitler's speeches, mastering his posture, body language and voice inflection. Thus, the fire and malice of his messages are communicated, although if you listen closely you can hear Chaplin use such words as schnitzel, lederhosen, and other terms most Americans with little or no German training can understand. In addition, Chaplin Germanizes English phrases to make them sound more comical, such as tighten-de-belten. But, never breaking character allows Chaplin to sell his portrayal. As true as it is today, it was the same in 1940, and even back in 1440 It's not what you say, it's how you say it.Chaplin also excels in the directorial aspect of this movie. He uses many different aspects and strategies to portray the world that surrounds his storyline. Without utilizing very much in the way of camera movement, Chaplin uses other ways such as music &#150; both diegetic and non-diegetic &#150; as well as creative cuts and pantomime to change the movie from being words on a page of script into a living, breathing work of art. In the scene involving the coins within the puddings, each table member finds a coin, which would mean they would have to sacrifice themselves to police. Each person passes theirs to Chaplin, who subsequently tries to swallow each coin in order to hide it. As he eats the pudding and bites down to find a coin, a crescendo of music tells the viewer what has happened.Another method pursued by Chaplin in making this movie is what is known as the Kuleshov Effect. This occurs when a show is coordinated alongside a different shot or sound effects, and the viewer perceives a link between the two. When Hynkel and Napaloni are viewing the armies, the camera remains focused on the two dignitaries, adding in background noise. The viewer is told that the two are looking at fast planes, and the sound of a plane engine is accompanied by the two men turning their heads quickly, seemingly watching the planes fly across the sky. As the larger artillery is viewed, the viewer hears heavy clanking metal and the two heads of state turn their gaze much more slowly. This is the Kuleshov Effect at its best, because even though the two actors are staring at a film crew and the inside of a movie studio, the viewer is convinced the two are actually conducting a military review.In Hynkel's final speech, actually delivered in the character of the Jewish barber, Chaplin uses camera-work to combine unlike shots as well. As he calls out to Hannah, his love, he looks to the sky. Simultaneously, she wakes up miles away, and looks to the sky as well. Although the two are miles away and there is no way that she can actually hear him calling to her, the viewer can't help but think that she can hear his voice carrying on the wind. This is Chaplin's directing at its best. I would definitely recommend this movie to anybody who loves to laugh.

I guess her screams got her cast for certainly her looks didn't. And her hair . . . her hair. In the face, over the eye . . awful look. Brandy, the girl friend. Screams got her cast for that's about all she does well in this poor flick. To me, the guys fared better and were better to look at as well. Matthew Settle, a good looking guy, did well as Hewitt's boy friend. As did Freddie Prinze Jr as her ex boy friend. I did like the dry humor of Jeffrey Combs as the hotel manager He got laughs and they were so welcome. I found Mekhi Phifer a big bore and was glad to see him get his come up-pence.And what a surprise to see Jack Black in this as, what else, an obnoxious dope smoker who grows his own stash on the island. His hair has gotta go.The scenery wasn't that great as most of the movie was shot at night. I hope this is the end of Hewitt and her screams, which drove me up the wall.

Throughout his career, he has demonstrated a variety of personas, taking on roles that are both challenging and intense. It is apparent that, as a director, he has the same talent. Tim Roth's first and only directorial effort to date, The War Zone, is a haunting picture of family. Featuring perfect acting, intense scenes, and an overall atmospheric darkness that coincides with the main themes, The War Zone is an excellent film. It is also one of the most difficult movies I've ever had the opportunity to watch.The film opens with Tom (played by Freddie Cunliffe), a teenage boy who is angry with his family for moving away from the city and into Middle of Nowhere, England. He misses London and he's not getting attention from his family because of his mother's (Tilda Swinton) pregnancy. Along with his mother, Tom lives with his father (Ray Winstone) and older sister, Jessie (Lara Belmont). Not long after the film begins, the mother's water breaks and the four of them make their way to the hospital. It is a dark, rainy night and, on the way, the father flips the car. Luckily, everyone is OK despite a few minor scrapes and bruises. Mum delivers the baby and the kids go home with Dad. The car accident is not mentioned again throughout the film, but it serves as a kind of foreshadowing of events to come. The normal schedule of life, interrupted by something startling, is the basis of this film.After Mum comes home and the baby settles into the home, things seem to go back to normal with this family. One day, however, Tom sees something disturbing. He and Mum and when they get back, Tom goes around to the side of the house and sees his father and sister in a position that looks a little too close for comfort. He confronts Jessie later, but she calls him a perv and says he didn't see what he thought he did. Tom is determined, though, and his search for the truth leads him to discovering the most horrible of family secrets and what unfolds is an emotional reckoning that no family should ever have to face.This is a devastating look into the degradation of a seemingly normal family and Tim Roth's direction shows that perfectly. Throughout the film, the entire atmosphere is dark and it is typically rainy. Even the beach, which is shown several times, looks like an unhappy place. The actors play each role to absolute perfection. Tilda Swinton is very good as the mother, a woman who is seemingly unaware of the terrible secret bubbling below the surface. Ray Winstone is terrifying as Dad, a father who seems very loving on the outside. On the inside, though, there is a monster waiting to attack. The two children are played by newcomers Lara Belmont and Freddie Cunliffe. Tim Roth has said in interviews that these two were selected because of their fresh faces, the fact that the audience would know them as their characters instead of actors. This is very effective. Lara Belmont is heartbreaking as Jessie, a teenage girl forced to put up certain walls. This is one of the best performances I've ever seen from an actress of that age group. Without her, this film would not be what it is. Freddie Cunliffe is excellent as Tom, the boy who discovers the truth about his family and must decide what to do with his newfound knowledge.The War Zone is consistently bleak and is often relentless. It shows abuse for what it is an unnecessary evil that affects the lives of everyone involved. This film is never a happy story. It is free of clich√©s and makes for some difficult viewing. If a person can get past that, though, The War Zone is a rewarding film experience. Tim Roth has accomplished something great here. I can't wait to see him do something else in the future.9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"9 November 2008","score":"","review":" Tim Roth is an excellent actor.

As a dying gunfighter, Wayne is forced to play a downbeat and more introspective character than we are used to from him. Still a dangerous man when threatened, his J.B. Books character is a man who has come to terms with his past. He knows the kind of man he is, and he knows his way of life is over. All he is looking to do is bow out with dignity. But any man who crosses him will not likely be around long to regret it, either.The film begins with Wayne as we knew him best. Outgunning a highwayman and leaving him for dead. Soon, the Duke finds himself in Carson City, Nevada in the doctor's office of Jimmy Stewart. Stewart confirms what another doctor had already told Wayne. He will soon be dead from cancer. Worse than that, his final days will be filled with agonizing pain, followed by loss of facilities. All Stewart can do is give him something for the pain and his advice. His J.B. Books character is said to be a brave man. Stewart suggests he find the courage to end things before the symptoms become too crippling. Wayne thanks the doc, and checks himself into a boarding house where he plans to live out his final days. The house is run by a prim and proper widower played by Lauren Bacall. Once she finds out her new boarder is an infamous gunman, she wants him out. Her son, played by Ron Howard, is starstruck by Wayne. He wants Wayne to teach him what he knows. Once word gets out that this legendary gunfighter is in town, there are those who look to either take him out or make a profit off him somehow.

JTM got a several typical characters, good killing scenes, new locations and - the most important - JTM got a great, classic-type Jason big, merciless monster with silent rage. So, if you're a fan of Friday the 13th you should have to see it for yourself and make your own opinion - at least because it's the part of classic slasher series.

It's so subtle that it's called easily as conventional, but there's something there, something very dark in his style that has come out in many of the films he's directed (and sometimes starred in). In fact, in one way or another to greater or lessor digress all of his directed\/acted westerns (High Plains Drifter, The Outlaw Josey Wales, Unforgiven) run a streak of the bleak in them, and only once in a while become resolved in light of a happy ending or something decent. They're still (usually) traditional stories, only stripped away of all of the BS that John Wayne had to carry with him like an insecure badge of masculine honor.Pale Rider is one of the 'happier' ones, by proxy that a) Eastwood, in a rare outing, plays something that is actually more-so the hero than an anti-hero, only anti in that he doesn't quite play by the law (then again, neither do the law in the film- the six or seven deputies), and b) there is something of an actual happy ending, different from Fistful of Dollars only inasmuch that, again, the Preacher is a true good-guy Man-with-no-name. This doesn't necessarily make Eastwood's character any less of a bad-ass than usual, or how he plays him by proxy, which makes it even more interesting. There's moments of insatiable one-liner-type wit, or just a couple of laugh-out-loud bits of real grit that we come to love from Eastwood in these kinds of roles. What makes it work as something nearing the wholesome (if not entirely PG-rated) is the conscience of the Preacher- who, actually, hints at not being a preacher at all in a wonderful scene with Sarah Wheeler- and the spirit of the small-townies vs. the big money-barons like Coy LaHood.The story, perhaps, isn't quite original. Even without having seen Shane (or, for that matter as a slightly opposite but relevant comparison, the Seven Samurai), I can tell there are used parts here, not least of which the last scene with the girl crying out for the Preaher on horseback. And there are some scenes that just ring as corny with the dialog or not all there performance-wise - sadly by this I mean the two principle female characters played by Carrie Songress and Sydney Penny, the latter having usually excruciatingly delivered lines like her miracle-plea. Maybe some will dig that part of the sub-plot, and while I didn't it did not detract from the overall entertainment value of Pale Rider. It's mostly a lean, effective and fun\/dark\/absorbing thriller with killer climax and meaty male stock characters (i.e. Richard Kiel's mute Club, a serious parody of the parody Mongo from Blazing Saddles) that reveals the psychology behind the director while going for what works, simply, for the mainstream crowd. 8.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"9 November 2008","score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Say what you will about the man or his methods of storytelling, Clint Eastwood is a master at his own particular kind of style.

In this pairing, they can't resist asking awkward questions for each other (De Niro being more prejudice and Grodin trying to seek out why he does these actions), in which we find out (or judge for ourselves) who is the better person. Grodin's character stole ¬£15 million... and gave it to charity. But with the apparent justice system that breaking a law is still breaking the law he is taken into custody. My single favourite aspect was Danny Elfman's score, which was a complete and utter consistent delight, embodying the era and turning an apparently dark film quite light hearted creating a perfect mood.
