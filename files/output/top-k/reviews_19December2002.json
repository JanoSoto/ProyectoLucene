Fans of The Ring gripe a lot that Scream was an over-rated teen slasher film. I will give them that. It is over-rated, maybe because when it came out, there had not been a good teen slasher flick since A Nightmare on Elm Street, although I'm not really a fan of that title. Also, it seemed cool; it was in that mid-90's cool dialogue trend, where every movie thought it was written and directed by Tarantino or Kevin Smith. So when this thing came out, hey, it was cool. It was cool to see a teen slasher movie MAKE FUN of itself. It was also good to see Wes Craven finally get a good movie, probably his best, and to see Neve Campbell light up the big screen with her radiant smile and perfect girl-next-door mannerisms. And it was over-rated. Like many other over-rated flicks of the 90s, Titanic, The Blair Witch Project, The English Patient, it was forgotten in about 6 months. The sequels didn't help. While they weren't bad, not bad at all really, they sort of insulted the superior tone of the first film by cashing in on a statement AGAINST such actions. And of course, we got I Know What You Did Last Summer, Valentine, Urban Legend, and dozens of other movies EXACTLY LIKE THIS ONE that all pretty much sucked. But I watched this movie again the other day. And you know what? It's better now than when it came out. Like Psycho or Halloween, this movie is the best of its particular sub-genre.

I have to say, despite the 10-11 times i've seen this, it still holds up with magnificent strength and emotion. The scenes where Bailey has never been born with Clarence the angle and the triumphant concluding scene in Stewart's house where all his friends come to his aid are famous beyond comparison, but still are mesmerizing and emotional. What often is overlooked is the mountain of great dialogue in this film. Barrymore and Stewart have so many great lines-I'm and old man and most people hate me, but I don't like them either; Oh, why don't you stop annoying people!; Is it too much to ask that people can live their lives with a few nice rooms and a bath and not have to live in your slums? We need this run-down old building just so there can be somewhere people can go and not crawl to Potter. Jimmy Stewart gives one of THE performances of all time as the ultimate put-upon good guy George Bailey. All he wants to do is get out of Bedford Falls, travel the world and go to college. But, because of a string of coincidences and occurences where George puts others above himself, he ends up never leaving the town. Donna Reed is his loving wife Mary, who waits around for George to realize that he loves her. This situation leads to one of the most touching and romantic scenes on film, where as the plastic magnate Sam Wainwright talks to George and Mary on the same phone, they look into each other's eyes and you see the what they truly feel for eachother. George grabs Mary, saying I don't wanna get married to anyone anywhere at anytime, but he is cut off in the middle of his speech by the emotion, and they embrace. Rob Reiner claims he can't watch or discuss this scene without tearing up. How Stewart and Reed didn't win Oscars for this scene alone is unthinkable. Also, Lionel Barrymore is great as the evil Mr. Potter (with his wheelchair pilot\/crony, Potter is the predecessor to everyone from the Beatles Mean Mr. Mustard to Mr. Burns on The Simpsons)-who you believe is just a mean old man at the beginning, but then when he gives his final major speech to Stewart you realize what a twisted and cruel monster he truly is. The director, Frank Capra, must also be given credit when praising this film. He directs the actors and frames them in such a way that the true relationships and actions between them are so much more meaningful. He really knew what he was doing when making this film. The make-up and lighting department also successfully show the wear of 18 years on the principle actors-this movie takes place with the same actors from the period of 1928-1946, and Reed's and Stewart's make-up jobs are extremely convincing. Some great moments The close-ups of Stewarts face when 1.) He lears if he doesn't take over the Bailey Building and Loan, the board of trustees will vote with Potter and drive the institution out of business, and 2.) In the fantasy scenes, where he runs away from Ma Bailey's Boarding House and realizes that not even his own mother regognizes him.

I have to say, despite the 10-11 times i've seen this, it still holds up with magnificent strength and emotion. The scenes where Bailey has never been born with Clarence the angle and the triumphant concluding scene in Stewart's house where all his friends come to his aid are famous beyond comparison, but still are mesmerizing and emotional. What often is overlooked is the mountain of great dialogue in this film. Barrymore and Stewart have so many great lines-I'm and old man and most people hate me, but I don't like them either; Oh, why don't you stop annoying people!; Is it too much to ask that people can live their lives with a few nice rooms and a bath and not have to live in your slums? We need this run-down old building just so there can be somewhere people can go and not crawl to Potter. Jimmy Stewart gives one of THE performances of all time as the ultimate put-upon good guy George Bailey. All he wants to do is get out of Bedford Falls, travel the world and go to college. But, because of a string of coincidences and occurences where George puts others above himself, he ends up never leaving the town. Donna Reed is his loving wife Mary, who waits around for George to realize that he loves her. This situation leads to one of the most touching and romantic scenes on film, where as the plastic magnate Sam Wainwright talks to George and Mary on the same phone, they look into each other's eyes and you see the what they truly feel for eachother. George grabs Mary, saying I don't wanna get married to anyone anywhere at anytime, but he is cut off in the middle of his speech by the emotion, and they embrace. Rob Reiner claims he can't watch or discuss this scene without tearing up. How Stewart and Reed didn't win Oscars for this scene alone is unthinkable. Also, Lionel Barrymore is great as the evil Mr. Potter (with his wheelchair pilot\/crony, Potter is the predecessor to everyone from the Beatles Mean Mr. Mustard to Mr. Burns on The Simpsons)-who you believe is just a mean old man at the beginning, but then when he gives his final major speech to Stewart you realize what a twisted and cruel monster he truly is. The director, Frank Capra, must also be given credit when praising this film. He directs the actors and frames them in such a way that the true relationships and actions between them are so much more meaningful. He really knew what he was doing when making this film. The make-up and lighting department also successfully show the wear of 18 years on the principle actors-this movie takes place with the same actors from the period of 1928-1946, and Reed's and Stewart's make-up jobs are extremely convincing. Some great moments The close-ups of Stewarts face when 1.) He lears if he doesn't take over the Bailey Building and Loan, the board of trustees will vote with Potter and drive the institution out of business, and 2.)

Pierce Brosnan is a worthy Bond, but he just doesn't have the screen presence of Arnie (does anybody?)Once again, Cameron pulls out that little bit more with the action scenes, especially towards the end with the various harrier sequences, although the missile with it's human passenger did have me going hmmmm, a bit. But it was all tongue-in-cheek, and as such works very well.Of course, since 9\/11 the scenes with the terrorists in a skyscraper, being attacked by a harrier, may be a little too close for comfort for some people.Jamie Lee Curtis is fantastic as Arnie's wife, little knowing what her husband does for a living. I do hope she steers clear of any more Halloween movies. They're getting as tiresome as the Friday the 13th saga.

While this is a fantasy movie, and an action flick you didn't just get the feeling it was made for fifteen year old boys or to sell a tie-in video game. I can't say the movie had a great deal of intellectual content, but as an old fashioned popcorn movie it more than achieved what it set out to do. My only criticisms was I felt that the explanation for the beast was a bit hurried and that Mark Dacasos' intriguing character Mani never fulfilled his potential. There was a lot more that could have been done with him I thought.  Dacascos, best known for 'Crying Freeman', is much better than you might expect, and joins a first rate French cast led by the impressive Samuel Le Bihan (previously unknown to me), and supported by husband and wife team Vincent Cassel ('La Haine') and Monica Bellucci ('Dobermann'). Cassel is super cool as always and Bellucci is stunningly beautiful. Both deserve to become international stars, something which is bound to happen to Bellucci once the sequels to 'The Matrix' are released next year. Hopefully the same will happen for Cassel one day.

SPOILERS ahead! I put my own tag, IMDb, please don't add yours as well!)I've heard people say the acting is bad, that it's just people screaming & shaking the camera.  THAT'S THE POINT!  If that was happening to YOU, you'd scream a lot and shake whatever you were holding, too!  Also, some people have said the cast didn't know what they were doing. Well, they weren't SUPPOSED to know! Kids lost in the woods rarely know what they're doing! Besides, half the movie was ad-libbed! Intentionally!I've also heard complaints about the marketing scheme & the website & the hype, but I never knew about ANY of that stuff before I saw the film. And I've heard complaints about people thinking it's real.  Well, DUH! Of course it's not real! It's a movie! how else do you think the cast was able to do interviews & such after shooting it!?Okay, now that I've vented, on with the review.Great movie, one of the few horror films I've ever actually liked.  The acting\/improvisation was excellent. Heather pulled off her part to a T, Josh kicked extreme amounts of butt, and Mike was okay.Great imagery and cinematography.  The B&W\/Color contrast between the two cameras really added some extra depth by letting you see what parts their teacher would actually see if it'd ever been turned in. And the shaped branches, the bloody shirt, the stone piles, the screeching, Mike standing in the corner,...it all just added so much to the movie. Pay close attention to the interviews & narration at the beginning, otherwise much of the imagery won't make sense.All in all, great film. Buy it.

Two ingredients that go to make a hell of an action picture. Cameron always seems to get that little bit extra out of an action sequence, something that's a bit different from all the rest. And Arnie...what needs to be said about him. He gets to use a mini-gun again, just like in Predator, but with far more effect.People have pointed out the inconsistencies in the plot, but that's just part-and-parcel of time-travel pictures. By it's very nature it's a paradox. So you have to give it a little leeway in the consistency department.Robert Patrick is suitably emotionless as the killer android, but I couldn't help thinking the fight sequences between him and Arnie looked a bit weird - Arnie is seriously larger than Patrick. But only a little bit. They carried it off well enough, though.Another minor niggle (now I've watched the film several times) is to do with continuity and editing. And that's the door to the SWAT van. As it's being chased along the street by the T-1000 (Patrick) in a helicopter, he fires at the van with an automatic weapon. We then see the door, with Linda Hamilton hiding behind it, firing back at the helicopter. The door has three big holes near the window. There's another exchange of gunfire, and cuts between the chopper and van, and the next time we see the door, it has loads of holes in it, but the three big holes have disappeared. Another exchange of fire\/cuts and the van door is back to the three big holes only, again. It's a minor glitch, but it niggles every time I see it and ruins the scene for me now.That aside, the picture has everything you'd want out of an Arnie action flick. Gunfights, explosions, Arnie one-liners, the works.If you have a chance to see the extended edition it's worth it. Like with the Aliens special edition, it adds enough extra bits to make the movie more entertaining and worthwhile, but doesn't throw in anything that changes the plot much. There's a dream scene involving Michael Biehn (Reece from the original film) which is a nice addition, and some extra footage in the foundry at the end which better shows the problems the T-1000 had after being frozen.All in all a worthy sequel to the original and another classic Cameron action movie.

And I must tell you, when I saw it when it finally came out I wasn't dissapointed, and to this day I still feel the same way.It's a darn shame that this film gets blasted like it does. It shows me that the majority of the people (and Godzilla fans) that take the time to write reviews for films probably don't know what they are talking about when they talk of America's Godzilla.There are a couple of main issues critics and Godzilla fans have with the film. The story and the monster itself, 'Godzilla'.If you look back at all of the original Japanese Godzilla flicks, you aren't going to find a great (not to mention BELIEVABLE) story or plot. I realize this, even being a fan of all things Godzilla. Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich's 'Godzilla' atleast, in my opinion, had the audience believing what was going on up on the screen. And if the story was slightly dull to some of you, you should let it pass. Remember what 'Godzilla' is about, afterall.And what was wrong with the monster itself, Godzilla? Nothing. If you get two action figures, one being a model of the original Godzilla from the Japanese series and a model of the new American Godzilla you will find differences but both are remarkably alike in alot of ways. They both have the spikes, gigantic size, and famous roar. The major differences being the skin color, face, and longer legs. I loath it when people bring up how they shouldn't have changed Godzilla's looks. I mean, I love the old Godzilla look, it may be silly to some, but to me it's still cool. But it would NOT have worked for this film at ALL. If they had made the American version with a creature that had big 'googily' eyes and flying around on his tail kicking monsters, it would have ended up being a laugh-fest at the theaters.What the American 'Godzilla' brings us is a believable monster that has the spirit and characteristics of the original, that satisfies the audience. It was just more realistic. Shouldn't we have expected that? Devlin and Emmerich came up with a monster that was realistic. Something the creators of the original attempted at doing but were limited to rubber suits. Something the Japanese audience accepts, but the American audience will not. It's sad that most Godzilla fans and critics do not understand this.I personally believe that the majority of the general audience ENJOYED this film. It's just the critical blasting from G Fans and Critics that got alot of attention, unfortunately, and therefore this gets labeled as a 'bad' film. It's sad really that people can't enjoy this film.This is one of my favorite DVD's to plug in. It's Big, Loud, and Fun. And although we've had lots of great films with tons of Special Effects, there's nothing quite like it.So take a look at it, be open and I'm sure you will enjoy the fantastic pop-corn entertainment known as GODZILLA.

I don't think you can really judge the attitudes of the past based upon our own, current conceptions of what's right and wrong because really, in a nutshell, generations before just didn't know any better. For us to expect anyone to think beyond their own times is asking way too much. Visionaries of any generation are the exception, not the rule, and usually struggle to enlighten the rest of us. Who knows what future generations will think of us?That said, in looking at `Kong' through modern eyes, the meaning of the story does indeed continue to expand well beyond the intentions of its creators. That's what makes this movie so great. It still hits a nerve somewhere. Most people, for instance, can easily come away with more sympathy for Kong (not to mention his island inhabitants) than his captors. What is the significance of that? Have we progressed beyond this type of insensitivity and what kind of irony can be read into the ending? There is some interesting symbolism represented in this film as well. From the ominous gates of Skull Island to the power of the Empire State Building, many parallels between these two cultures map out a questionable (or is it justifiable?) path toward `progress' in the modern age. Discuss amongst yourselves, class.Well, anyway&#133;for those of you who don't have the patience for analytical discussion and are mainly interested in the pure function of story and plot,  `Kong' still packs a wallop. As a member of the `Star Wars' generation, I was amazed at how completely enthralling the action still is, even though the special effects and dialogue certainly seem `cheesy' by today's standards (it bears mention, however, that the effects, taken in the context of their times are amazing &#150; and continue to be when one considers the intricate craftsmanship that went into not only creating them, but blending them in with the live action). The filmmakers here still manage to create a character out of Kong himself via their models, but also use the conventions of editing, music and sound throughout these sequences to present a timeless mixture of excitement, suspense and even, in the end, pathos. The violence is effectively used and appropriately brutal (I suspect that this was pre-Hays Code?). And notice the choice NOT to have score in certain moments. It makes the atmosphere downright awesome and spooky (much of the NYC stage show and Kong's defeat of the giant lizard come to mind).Ah, and then there's the fair, the lovely, Fay Wray. Okay, her acting style seems very much rooted in the methods of silent star exposition &#150; this was after all made on the heels of the talkie advent. But there are two things that still make her inseparable from the success of this film 1) her scream is unsurpassed and undoubtedly set the template for future Janet Leighs and Judith O'Sheas (oh yes, there are different ways to scream my friends!); 2) her beauty, I think, still fits in with today's standards - and that's not always the case with actresses of the past. Fay Wray, as she was, is definitely very easy on the eyes and continues to be. Hail! All witness the power of the Golden Woman!
