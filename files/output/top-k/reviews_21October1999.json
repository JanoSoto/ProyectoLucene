[{"date":"21 October 1999","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  'Divorcing Jack' starts off a bit like Mike Leigh's 'Naked'played strictly for laughs. Soon it takes off to appear morelike a Hollywood actioner set in Ireland, even going so far asthrowing Richard Gant (who was last seen in 'The Big Lebowski',also featuring Thewlis) in as his black American buddy. Stilllots of laughs, with David Thewlis as David Thewlis (i.e. AdamSandler as Adam Sandler, Jim Carrey as Jim Carrey), specificallya miscreant journo in big big trouble with his wife, his boss,the police, the IRA, and anybody else the producers could thinkof. The film has basically nothing to say about the situation inNorthern Ireland (thankfully). Apart from a nearly pointless'gun-toting nun' and Thewlis captured-by-his-enemies  -only-to-miraculously-escape a few too many times, you could doa lot worse than this flick. Thewlis is definitely the focalpoint, and he saunters through with his usual 'charming as adrowned rat' panache. Could somebody please write this guy afantastic script, because he has a lot of talent and presenceand it would be great to see him do something else as noteworthyas 'Naked' before he packs it in and decides he wants to direct.
