With Disney on such a high expectations were, while this was increased by the superb vocal talent and wonderful animation, and for many those expectations were met. Though a lot are going to disagree with me, I have to come out and say that I think the film is kind of overrated. That doesn't mean I dislike it as a matter of fact I agree that it does have fantastic elements, but for the heaps of praise it gets I'm not sure if it holds up well enough.The story is effectively a toned down Hamlet. A lion prince named Simba is born, meaning that his cruel uncle Scar is now second in line to the throne. Scar plots to kill both King Mufasa and Simba, succeeding in killing Mufasa and making Simba believe he was at fault. Simba flees the kingdom and remains in exile for a number of years, until figures of the past challenge him and he must return home to take his rightful place as king. The story is a very interesting one, it is a much more mature than you would expect from Disney and I really enjoy it for that reason. Everything that happens seems to happen for a reason and there isn't any filler as far as the plot goes. After all this is a very big story and telling it in a cohesive mature manner works very well.The other impressive feature is the animation. It's clear that the animators put a lot of work in to create such a visually pleasing place for this to all happen in. The colours used give the place such a bright beautiful look and it is actually quite authentic looking too. Scenes of bird flying over the vivid landscape or of the sun shining over the land are so beautiful to look at. The character designs were also very good, like the contrast between the powerful Mufasa and the slimy Scar. The sheer scope of things is another wonderful aspect, such as when Scar's paw first comes down or the later Wildebeest stampede. Even things like the backgrounds look massive which gives an extra size to this world.The characters are rather hit and miss. Simba is a bit of a bland lead, he is just a kid for most of it but he does come off as a bit too boring and even obnoxious at times. He doesn't get any better the older he gets and Matthew Broderick's voice only adds to the dullness. Mufasa is just a brilliant character. He is designed wonderfully, has some really interesting characteristics and James Earl Jones' booming voice is perfect for it. A lot of people rate Scar as a top villain yet for me he's just decent. He is enjoyably devious and Jeremy Irons clearly has fun with the role, but he does come off as not that smart and a bit snivelling in the end. Zazu is very funny with Rowan Atkinson delivering some good lines and Rafiki is also very likable for coming across as a good friend. I'm not a big fan of Timon and Pumbaa as they come off as a bit annoying and wink at the camera too much, though they do have some amusing scenes. The Hyenas were daft but entertaining, while I think Nala was underplayed too much.I do have issues with the film. The message that it is trying to get across is an interesting one in how we must learn from the past to move forward. The problem is that when Simba confronts his past nobody believes him until Scar says what really happened. Looking at this you can't help but feel Simba would have been better off lying and that harms the whole point of the message. Also I think a lot of the comedic elements feel very misplaced. For a story as grand and serious as this I can't help but find that the comedy is too trivial at times which is distracting. As mentioned Timon and Pumbaa just feel a bit misplaced because they're jokes are slightly too silly. If done well, like with Zazu or the hyenas antics, then its nice relief but otherwise it doesn't work.Also I really find that the songs are a mixed bag. 'I Just Can't Wait to be King' and 'Can You Feel the Love Tonight' just come off as your typical pop songs and there isn't anything truly catchy or memorable about them. 'Hakuna Matata' is another one everyone loves, but for me it's just annoying. On the other hand however, 'Circle of Life' is a brilliantly grand number that opens the film perfectly and 'Be Prepared' is really catchy with some very enjoyable singing from Jeremy Irons. Elsewhere there are some really memorable sequences here. The circle of life opening is something that everyone should remember, the wildebeest chase is visually stunning as well as pulse-pounding, Simba talking to Mufasa in the clouds is sadly beautiful and the final battle sequence does have some great images. Also I thought it was very brave decision to actually show the body of Mufasa after his death. In fact going on from that the movie does have a very strong emotional core running throughout that is very welcoming and smartly used.On the whole I do think that The Lion King is a very accomplished piece from Disney, I just don't find it as engaging as most people do. This is a big story with a lot of big elements, I just find that whilst most of the work some of them aren't quite as successful. I do wish other Disney films were as acclaimed as The Lion King, but I still find an entertaining and well-made film.

When it exploits the title characters and we get to see the monsters delivering the goods than I say it works in a very Ed Wood kind of fashion. I think one would be surprised going into 'King Kong vs. Godzilla' when they find out that the monsters are not exploited at all. In fact I would say that they are only really in the film for about a third of the whole movie. Well, when one goes into a film called 'King Kong vs. Godzilla' and doesn't see the monsters than well...The film does a lot to build up the supposed story. A pharmaceutical company wants to capture Kong to advertise a new line of berries found on Skull Island. We get to meet the company's comical C.E.O and his goofy underlings who provide some humor that I don't think is fully compatible with American audiences. Godzilla comes and then we spend a great deal of time talking about how the military intends to stop him. I'm sorry but this stuff is so boring. I found every scene without the monsters to be an almost chore to sit through. I suppose the material with the C.E.O and Skull Island was a little easier to stomach but not by much really. I wanted monsters. How many times do we have to listen to the military dissect how they intend to kill Godzilla? Every film has these moments and it never changes. Godzilla if we haven't learned by now simply crushes whatever they throw at him and so these moments are pointless narratively and do nothing but add filler to the script. Give me monsters!This film also is interesting in that a conscious effort was made to make it palatable to American audiences. There are extra scenes sprinkled in with actor Eric Carter(who surprise surprise never did anything but this for the most part) as a UN newscaster. These scenes look like they were filmed in the break room at Universal. Everything about the American footage is pathetic and amateurish. It's embarrassing to watch because at least the Japanese footage has momentum to it. Whenever we cut to the American stuff the film grinds to a screeching halt. The film has bad enough pacing problems on it's own, it doesn't' need the help of the Yanks. They choose the worst possible places to insert the footage too. We often get it right after a monster scene, the last place it is wanted.What does work? The Monsters. The problem? They are not on the screen nearly enough and we miss their presence when they aren't. Don't get me wrong these aren't expert portrayals of monsters with character and soul.

I first saw this movie when I was about 6 years old and I was so scared of Jack Nicholson's performance as the Joker that I couldn't finish it, but when I was 13, I decided to watch the movie again and was able to watch the movie all the way through and was no longer scared of it, and I loved the movie and Nicholson's performance became one of my favorite parts of the movie.I have always been a Batman fan and after watching this movie for the first time on Blu Ray, I realized how much I really do like this movie and how I appreciate it even more now than I did then. One of my favorite things about this movie besides Nicholson's performance is Michael Keaton as Batman, not so much as Bruce Wayne, but his performance as Batman, he's my favorite Batman next to Kevin Conroy ( I know it's just his voice, but he's still awesome).After exploring more of the Batman universe though, I have a few small complaints about the movie and that is I realized how under-developed and under-used Commissioner Gordon and Harvey Dent are, they have a much bigger role in the Batman universe and I just think they got the short end of the stick. As for the other performances, I thought Kim Basinger did an okay job as Vicki Vale (although her screaming got kind of annoying after awhile, which I'm sure many will agree), and Robert Wuhl was good as Alexander Knox, sort of the comic relief of the movie. The other things I love about this movie is the score by Danny Elfman, it's just classic, speaking of the music, I actually don't mind the Prince music in the movie, I didn't really think it was too much of a distraction, in my opinion. I also love the production design and cinematography of the movie, the setting looked and felt like Gotham City to me.Overall this is one of my favorite Batman movies of all time and I just love almost everything about this movie, the directing job by Tim Burton, the acting, the music, and the whole look of this movie, it's just great, it's a classic Batman movie and I highly recommend it to all Batman fans and comic book fans in general, awesome movie. ) ","genre":null},{"date":"10 February 2014","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Tim Burton's Batman stars Michael Keaton as the Caped Crusader, Jack Nicholson as the clown prince of crime, the Joker, and Kim Basinger as a photographer and Bruce Wayne\/Batman's love interest, Vicki Vale.

Struggling to catch up or get any word among Capone's whereabouts, Ness hires a veteran cop named Jimmy Malone (Oscar winning Sean Connery). The cast also includes other big stars like Andy Garcia as a rookie cop George Stone\/Giuseppe Petri and Charles Martin Smith as Oscar Wallace.The story is pretty much everything you would expect from a movie like this. We see Ness doing everything in his power to dethrone Capone and offer him justice served cold but not very successfully. The money trail leaves them from one dead-end street to another with no trace of Capone's hideouts. But Capone's trail being followed also marked the end of his empire. If the pieces can be added up nicely, it will be evident that Capone owes the government a substantial amount of back taxes and evasion as we all know is major felony. Wallace, a certified accountant claims that tax evasion itself would be a gargantuan penalty if Capone was just charged on that alone. And as what comes with that an abundance of deaths occurred during this mob war era.The characters richness is what makes The Untouchables a very riveting movie. All the characters are multilayered with the exception of the leading character, Ness, who comes off pretty wooden and seems to be more opposing to the character of Capone who's quite charismatic and the wittiness and dry comical dialogue by Connery are the ones that I enjoy watching the most. Even Andy Garcia and Charles Martin Smith had lots of panache and the chemistry each character had towards one another makes this movie very special. The direction by Brian De Palma was fascinating, while the score by Ennio Morricone adds the right texture to the time period this movie was set in. The props and costumes were accurate. It felt like we had traveled back to the time of the Prohibition era.There are a lot of great scenes going on in The Untouchables. One of the many scenes involved Capone's seminar about the benefits of teamwork as he tells his band of syndicates and it results in a man getting pulverized by a baseball bat. The focus on the blood splattering out of the man's head and all the syndicate's reactions is a scene that will linger in my mind till eternity. The other standout was the ambush located at the train station which ends with Agent Stone diving to save a runaway baby carriage while keeping his weapon at tow. This scene will send chills up everyone's spine.Overall, this truly is one of the more engaging mobster movies of all times. It has great characters and the dialogue is remarkable and the characters truly draw onto you very nicely. Sure there's nothing original about the plot or the outcome, but the development of the characters and the technical aspects make this movie one you have to see to believe.

When the find a secret way of staying young and living forever, they don't think about what would happen if they had an accident. This film is about these 2 women fighting over one man and the face and figure of a young person.I loved the special effects in this movie. Even today they are not bad at all. Very good in fact compared to a lot of movies that come out these days.The comedy I thought was a little bit weak. It was funny but I think I only laughed out loud once maybe twice, but the story is good so that keeps you entertained until the end.The acting was as you would expect from these guys. There is a great bunch of actors in this film and they act really well. The main cast were Meryl Streep﻿, Bruce Willis and Goldie Hawn. I heard in an interview recently that Goldie was returning to acting after 12 years off... that I look forward to. I always thought she was great, and she has made a lot of classic movies.The movie was directed by Robert Zemeckis. This man is a legend in the movie industry and is clearly one of the top directors around. If you look back at his directing career you will see so many fantastic movies against his name. I hope to see many more of his films in the future.This film feels very 90s which I love and it is a lot of fun to watch...I will give this film 7 out of 10.I will not speak to you 'til you put your head on straight.For more reviews, please like my Facebook pagehttps\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews\/456572047728204?ref=hl ","genre":"Comedy, Fantasy"},{"date":"10 February 2014","score":"","review":" Fred's ego is out of control and he fails to give Velma the credit she deserves. This leads to acrimonious breakup for Mystery Inc. Two years later, they all receive an invitation to Spooky Island.

I was younger at that time and my tolerance level was much higher. I remember really liking it and I have no idea why. I won't deny that this movie is an OK time passer and somewhat cute at times, but it really infuriated me at the same time. I have no problem with wanting to put a different spin on things with a different kind of vision, but this was an insult to the Scooby Doo legacy. For starters, Fred was NEVER, EVER this arrogant. He was always confident and sure of himself, but egotism wasn't in his vocabulary. In this movie, they make Fred into an overbearing buffoon. Admiring himself in the mirror, in love with himself? Different is good, but that was too much. It resorts to lazy gags, such as fart and burping jokes, and juvenile slapstick.. Come on guys, how could you show so much contempt for Scooby fans? It's like they forgot why the gang was so lovable in the first place. They were always a cohesive unit that had no shortage of ingenuity. I didn't buy the split thing it felt phony. I'm sure I'll annoy people by comparing this to the television show, but I can't help it, I love Scooby, and to me? This isn't Scooby Doo. I was never a Scrappy Doo fan myself, but to make him a bad guy? Did they honestly think that would be clever? It was stupid. Freddie Prinze Jr. is awful as Freddy. He's a pretty bad actor in general, but he is especially bad in this one. He has no idea on how to portray Fred properly. Sarah Michelle Gellar is actually perfect as Daphne. She hits all the right notes and clearly researched her role. She portrayed Daphne perfectly in my books. Matthew Lillard is scary good as Shaggy. It didn't feel like I was watching an actor, he WAS Shaggy to me. I was so impressed by him. Linda Cardellini is pretty good as Velma. She had her off moments, but she comes through more often then not. Rowan Atkinson has fun in his role as the villain. Isla Fisher is simply romance fodder for Shaggy, simple as that. I'm not sure why they chose an animated dog....It looked rather cornyFinal Thoughts All of my carps aside, if I wasn't such a big Scooby fan, I would have probably enjoyed it more. It isn't totally void of entertainment. It can be cute at times, but for me it wasn't enough.

Definitely a better love story than Lolita.Then, there is Natalie Portman. For all these years I couldn't figure out why I thought she was the most beautiful woman in the world. Eight years later after watching this movie I've met a girl that looked exactly like her (Yes I'll clear this up, you creeps, she was the same age as me, 17). And I had no clue how a person could captivate me so much and for all these years after taking just one look at her. Now, after watching this movie at the age of 25, I understand where that came from. And yes it did make it a little awkward to watch a young Natalie Portman and remember those feelings. Did make it easier to feel for Leon though. To that I add, absolutely perfect writing, screenplay, acting and cinematography. Even if you've seen this movie before, do remember that it's been 20 years since it came out. Do yourself a favor and watch it again.

I really enjoyed it because it had that 'classic' feel to it. Like most animes made in the late 80's to 90's. The artwork wasn't horrid but is also wasn't over the top. Especially when the term pop-star is mentioned. If it was more modern. Then prepare for the overuse of stars and sparkles and pink. Lots and lots of pink, but it didn't have that. It was down to earth and i liked that about it a lot. Moving on, when the movie began I kind of drifted in and out because progress was moving so slow, but i was anxious to see what the obviously creepy, fish-eyed, gap toothed man in the crowd was going to do. I mean seriously. Who kept allowing that guy to attend all of Mima's shoots? Is there no security? But anyway, the guy was obviously a stalker and like most stalker films, I was expecting this guy to do what any other stalker would do. Run her life into the ground. But no PLOT TWIST. These tend to come out of nowhere in Perfect Blue. First we get the impression that Mima's going insane. Which is understandable considering what she's going through. But then the same hallucination that's tormenting Mima is floating around the obsessed fan and it made me think How is that possible? Soon I could no longer tell the difference between what was real and what was in Mima's head. Despite her obvious personality change no one gives two sh*ts. Mima basically walks around like a soulless doll and all they care about is the dumb movie.But enough of that. The ending is what got to me the most. Never would i have expected for the manager lady to be behind all of it. She was seriously the very last person I suspected. She showed no signs of being a psycho and was the only one who truly cared about Mima. Here I am waiting for the fish eyed dude to show up in Mima's apartment when she wakes up, but instead I get the total opposite.

Like most animes made in the late 80's to 90's. The artwork wasn't horrid but is also wasn't over the top. Especially when the term pop-star is mentioned. If it was more modern. Then prepare for the overuse of stars and sparkles and pink. Lots and lots of pink, but it didn't have that. It was down to earth and i liked that about it a lot. Moving on, when the movie began I kind of drifted in and out because progress was moving so slow, but i was anxious to see what the obviously creepy, fish-eyed, gap toothed man in the crowd was going to do. I mean seriously. Who kept allowing that guy to attend all of Mima's shoots? Is there no security? But anyway, the guy was obviously a stalker and like most stalker films, I was expecting this guy to do what any other stalker would do. Run her life into the ground. But no PLOT TWIST. These tend to come out of nowhere in Perfect Blue. First we get the impression that Mima's going insane. Which is understandable considering what she's going through. But then the same hallucination that's tormenting Mima is floating around the obsessed fan and it made me think How is that possible? Soon I could no longer tell the difference between what was real and what was in Mima's head. Despite her obvious personality change no one gives two sh*ts. Mima basically walks around like a soulless doll and all they care about is the dumb movie.But enough of that. The ending is what got to me the most. Never would i have expected for the manager lady to be behind all of it. She was seriously the very last person I suspected. She showed no signs of being a psycho and was the only one who truly cared about Mima. Here I am waiting for the fish eyed dude to show up in Mima's apartment when she wakes up, but instead I get the total opposite.

First of all I just have to say that I'm very impressed by the special effects of the movie, and also about its ageless image considering the year it was made. This is one of the best Sci-Fi movies out there, it's a classic.First of all the pacing of the movie is so well done, and it's necessary to be that way so it improves the horror effect on the viewers. You can actually see the movie and start thinking there is something wrong happening. Then the shadowy ambient surrounding the spaceship and also the point-of-view scenes that make us run with the characters is wonderful.The cast is very good, with a good center performance by Sigourney Weaver mainly. And the very design of the alien is horrifying, with a humanoid form but without showing any expressions meaning it is a cruel killer. The sound and images go very good together pacing the story combined also by the ship's sounds.Great horror\/Sci-Fi movie and definitely, as I said before one of the best in the genre.

Soundtrack in Trainspotting is good comply with all scenes, because this songs some scenes have engraved in my brain forever.Never before listened to Lou Reed, specifically did not give him a chance, but after this film I listen him everyday,Rip Lou.Also that song from the group Undeworld somehow fits into the flow of the movie perfect.Definitely the best British film ever made. After watching this movie i am definitely in to read a book Trainspotting that was written by Irvine Welsh according to which the movie is done. And i get the feeling that i will watch this movie over and over again. If you have not watched yet i don't know what are you waiting for.

Curtis works well as the disenfranchised wife. She's living with a spy, a man of action, adventure and international mystery, yet - like so many romantic leads in superhero films - she can't see through his disguise. She lacks all the excitement his days have, tries to capture it for herself and the result is predictably comic. Tom Arnold plays the sidekick for laughs. Given the life and death situations they find themselves in, he seems very quick with the jokes, though a stronger comic would likely have over shadowed Arnie. Rather than being the main storyline, the nuclear terrorists are a back drop to marital strife, and it's easier to explain to your other half why you're working so hard and never home when you're actually saving the world, rather than just believing you are.
