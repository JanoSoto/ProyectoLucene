My father showed this movie to me at a young age. Unfortunately, he died not too long ago and I'm so thankful he showed me this wonderful film. After watching it several times in recent months, I observed some of the strengths that made him enjoy it as much as I did. Despite its noticeable flaws, it still holds up and leaves an impact in my heart!Is it slow-paced and predictable? Oh there's no denial about that yet it connects with us on such a deep level and gives us time to learn about these interesting characters. Also, the pacing is so hypnotic that I still didn't want to stop watching, even after it ended. The vast majority of people who dislike it are either disappointed by the hype it received or are offended by the excessive profanity. My solution for these two issues is incredibly simple. One is to get passed its publicity and just take it for what it is. As for the constant swearing, try not to judge the movie based on how times the F word is spoken and instead, merely appreciate the flow of dialogue or solely listen to the purpose of why things are being said. The only way to know whether it's good or not is to watch it. I'm aware that this movie isn't for everyone, but I personally recommend you sit down and watch it from beginning to end, even if you hate it afterward.For quite some time, it's been speculated that Kevin Smith and Rob Reiner at one point did revisions on the script, all the better for it! This movie is brilliantly written with powerful scenes and an alluring plot that revolves around a troubled man (played by the talented Matt Damon) who needs direction in life. Its internal conflict is something that is thought provoking with an astonishing payoff. The characters are alive and believable, while Van Sant effectively puts the audience in the right atmosphere. Some fans might have been disappointed with the apparent blandness of Skylar (played by Minnie Driver) or perhaps her weak performance, but I think she tried her best and had excellent chemistry with Will.In conclusion, watch this movie to see how amazing it is.

Also included is a short but key scene with character actor extraordinaire Brian Cox as the original Hannibal Lecter (here and in the book spelled Lecktor). His performance, as stated in another review, is better than Hopkins. Rather than reveal the plot - redone with Hopkins and Edward Norton as lead FBI consultant Will Graham some 20 years later at the tail end of the long series - I wish to instead focus on the novel (there were 4 others to follow which paralleled the movies). In the book, the author outlines the making of a serial killer to a great degree, so much that it could be a Criminology textbook. And, having taken Criminology, I must point out the only error in that he merges two distinct, but different, psychopathic profiles. It doesn't matter, as this IS fiction, unlike say 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', and it is perfect. I used to own the VHS tape, and cassette soundtrack (Excellent! With both pop songs and original musical compositions), however have lost both. I must buy the Blu Ray DVD soon, but there has been no CD release or otherwise of the soundtrack. Some of the songs can still be found on their respective artist's own catalogue, however. There is a great lead performance by William Petesen, later of CSI, which alone should have brought this into reissue sooner. There is also Chicago cop standby Dennis Farina, and sexy Kim Griest, as well as solid turns from every other supporting player (including, of all people, Chris Elliott during his dramatic acting period). I can think of few talents on par with director Mann (please IMDb him and you might be surprised at his output, and quirkiness). The same goes for the intensity of Petersen, and Brian Cox as Lecktor. If there is one, good thriller-horror movie you need to watch, this is it. It is the ORIGINAL, at least as far as the crop released during the modern, post 1970's era of flash AND substance is concerned. And it is so intense that during its showing at my local cinema, a half dozen people walked out following a particularly gruesome - graphic without being degrading - scene near the beginning.

The film begins on the fields of Antietam where Robert watches men die and is grazed by a bullet himself. He lies by the dead and hides until an unknown black man, hired by the Union to bury the dead checks to see if he is alive. While his injuries are being treated he learns that President Lincoln plans to issue the Emancipation Proclamation, freeing all slaves in rebelling states. While attending a party in Boston the Governor of Massachusetts, John Andrew, and Fredrick Douglas approach Robert about leading the first all black infantry. He accepts and is promoted to colonel. After gaining enlisted men, the first of whom is one of Robert's friends, the new regiment goes through boot camp. Not long after training began the Confederate Congress issued a proclamation stating that any slave who was caught fighting for the union would be returned to his owners, if they were in a Union uniform they were to be killed. All white officers in charge of the black regiments would be executed as well. At this point Robert tells the men that anyone who wishes to leave may do so without consequence, but the next morning he awakens to find all of his men still at camp ready for training. Once the men are trained they begin to ask when they will get their uniforms and guns. One man is caught trying to find shoes and is whipped because the commanders thought he was deserting. At this point the gravedigger who saved Robert named, John Rawlins, shows him the need for shoes and Robert confronts the quartermaster for holding out on them. Rawlins becomes the liaison between the black troops and the white commanders ,and is later unofficially promoted to Sergeant Major since blacks could not hold higher ranks. For a while things get better and the soldiers get their guns and blue uniforms, but then pay is issued. A white soldier would have been paid $13 for their services, but the colored soldiers are only paid $10. Trip, the soldier that was whipped, is infuriated by this and tells his comrades to rip their checks. Robert wins the men's respect by saying that if they refuse their pay no one in the group will take theirs.As bonds within the group grow the tension from outside begins to grow. White soldiers outside the group scoff and belittle the colored soldiers saying they will never see any action and are only there to do chores like scavenging supplies. After bribing some officials Robert gets the men some action, but their first skirmish is overshadowed by the Battle of Gettysburg. As generals begin planning the attack on Fort Wagner, Robert volunteers his men for the dangerous mission of being the first troops in. As they began to head out the next morning they finally earn the support of the white troops. Before they depart Robert leaves a journalist with his letters and accounts so that the world can know what happened with the 54th. He then gets off his horse and stands with his men during the attack. Though the attack on Fort Wagner was a failure, the 54th fought bravely which helped pave the way for more black troops whom Lincoln credited with helping turn the tide of the war.This movie for the most part is accurate, because it was written using some of Robert Shaw's actual letters. It correctly illustrates a timeline from Antietam to Fort Wagner. It is also very accurate on important dates for African Americans during the war like the Emancipation Proclamation and General Orders No. 111, which is only partly mentioned as the confederate congress's proclamation. This proclamation could also be considered an inaccuracy to some degree. It was really aimed at General Benjamin F. Butler and his men due to their hostilities towards southern women. Another inaccuracy appears at the end of the film at Fort Wagner. The movie leads one to believe that the 54th was completely annihilated, however in reality only 272 of the 600 men were captured, killed, or wounded.Glory leaves out the beginning and end of the war, but there isn't really anyway to correct this within the context of the movie since it is following the African American involvement in the war. One thing that could have been included was a brief follow up on other black regiments that formed due to the 54th and their bravery. The movie was very accurate and gave good context to the battles that were important to Robert Shaw and the 54th,which means that a lot of important events like Gettysburg were swept under the rug. It also covers the most important issue during this time, slavery and views of blacks, very well. It shows how even though the North was fighting to free slaves they still thought less of them which can often be forgotten and left out of the history books. In my opinion Glory is a great movie. It provides a new perspective to the war and focuses on more than just Gettysburg, Lincoln, and other major battles that we have all heard about. It praises the unknowns of history which I love. The fact that the director chose to use Robert Shaw's letters not only to make the script accurate, but also as voice overs to provide insight into feelings at the camp makes the movie seem so much more real. It does however end very sadly. I cried for the last ten minutes of the movie and so I can't say that it would be one to watch with friends or if you're looking for something happy, but if you want something that is historically accurate and an underdog success story of sorts this is the way to go.

Once the men are trained they begin to ask when they will get their uniforms and guns. One man is caught trying to find shoes and is whipped because the commanders thought he was deserting. At this point the gravedigger who saved Robert named, John Rawlins, shows him the need for shoes and Robert confronts the quartermaster for holding out on them. Rawlins becomes the liaison between the black troops and the white commanders ,and is later unofficially promoted to Sergeant Major since blacks could not hold higher ranks. For a while things get better and the soldiers get their guns and blue uniforms, but then pay is issued. A white soldier would have been paid $13 for their services, but the colored soldiers are only paid $10. Trip, the soldier that was whipped, is infuriated by this and tells his comrades to rip their checks. Robert wins the men's respect by saying that if they refuse their pay no one in the group will take theirs.As bonds within the group grow the tension from outside begins to grow. White soldiers outside the group scoff and belittle the colored soldiers saying they will never see any action and are only there to do chores like scavenging supplies. After bribing some officials Robert gets the men some action, but their first skirmish is overshadowed by the Battle of Gettysburg. As generals begin planning the attack on Fort Wagner, Robert volunteers his men for the dangerous mission of being the first troops in. As they began to head out the next morning they finally earn the support of the white troops. Before they depart Robert leaves a journalist with his letters and accounts so that the world can know what happened with the 54th. He then gets off his horse and stands with his men during the attack. Though the attack on Fort Wagner was a failure, the 54th fought bravely which helped pave the way for more black troops whom Lincoln credited with helping turn the tide of the war.This movie for the most part is accurate, because it was written using some of Robert Shaw's actual letters. It correctly illustrates a timeline from Antietam to Fort Wagner. It is also very accurate on important dates for African Americans during the war like the Emancipation Proclamation and General Orders No. 111, which is only partly mentioned as the confederate congress's proclamation. This proclamation could also be considered an inaccuracy to some degree. It was really aimed at General Benjamin F. Butler and his men due to their hostilities towards southern women. Another inaccuracy appears at the end of the film at Fort Wagner. The movie leads one to believe that the 54th was completely annihilated, however in reality only 272 of the 600 men were captured, killed, or wounded.Glory leaves out the beginning and end of the war, but there isn't really anyway to correct this within the context of the movie since it is following the African American involvement in the war. One thing that could have been included was a brief follow up on other black regiments that formed due to the 54th and their bravery. The movie was very accurate and gave good context to the battles that were important to Robert Shaw and the 54th,which means that a lot of important events like Gettysburg were swept under the rug. It also covers the most important issue during this time, slavery and views of blacks, very well. It shows how even though the North was fighting to free slaves they still thought less of them which can often be forgotten and left out of the history books. In my opinion Glory is a great movie. It provides a new perspective to the war and focuses on more than just Gettysburg, Lincoln, and other major battles that we have all heard about. It praises the unknowns of history which I love. The fact that the director chose to use Robert Shaw's letters not only to make the script accurate, but also as voice overs to provide insight into feelings at the camp makes the movie seem so much more real. It does however end very sadly. I cried for the last ten minutes of the movie and so I can't say that it would be one to watch with friends or if you're looking for something happy, but if you want something that is historically accurate and an underdog success story of sorts this is the way to go.

The film begins on the fields of Antietam where Robert watches men die and is grazed by a bullet himself. He lies by the dead and hides until an unknown black man, hired by the Union to bury the dead checks to see if he is alive. While his injuries are being treated he learns that President Lincoln plans to issue the Emancipation Proclamation, freeing all slaves in rebelling states. While attending a party in Boston the Governor of Massachusetts, John Andrew, and Fredrick Douglas approach Robert about leading the first all black infantry. He accepts and is promoted to colonel. After gaining enlisted men, the first of whom is one of Robert's friends, the new regiment goes through boot camp. Not long after training began the Confederate Congress issued a proclamation stating that any slave who was caught fighting for the union would be returned to his owners, if they were in a Union uniform they were to be killed. All white officers in charge of the black regiments would be executed as well. At this point Robert tells the men that anyone who wishes to leave may do so without consequence, but the next morning he awakens to find all of his men still at camp ready for training.

As a straight man I wouldn't want to be dating a female who was keeping it from me that she was an actual man. I understand the outrage that would be gleamed towards Teena but at the same time you can't condone what happened to her with the rapes and eventual murder.

In short, the even ones 1,3, 5 (OMG!) pale in comparison. The transitory Generations, number 7, was pretty good as well, and in fact shook up the trend - the last two, 9 & 10, were both lackluster. Unlike almost every other American phenomenon, and the success of British international series such as James Bond or the Pink Panthers, these first Treks were an almost exclusively domestic pop culture fare. Certainly the 1960's TV show, as well as The Next Generation, were seen and followed around the World, at times in a cult like status (it is said that Captain Kirk is the most recognizable fictional character of all time in that he can be identified by a Billion people). But, apparently, non-North Americans just don't see the appeal of the motion pictures, and their international gross is far below the domestic one. I believe that the reason for this is that within the United States, where American culture is dog eat dog and the pursuit of profit and the American Dream is paramount, such a socialized, ultimately fair and just alternate existence is appealing (in contrast). However, in the much more socialist areas of northern Europe, such an ideology is so common within their social safety net that the stronger attraction is to more bombastic and patriotic bugle soundings of the over-the-top action hero films, or underdog stories. That Star Trek could have become such an iconic and identifiably American story at home has always amazed me given the socialist undertones. The Enterprise and her crew are not even military, contrary to popular belief, but are more analogous to the United Nations on a scientific expedition to Antartica. Kirk himself represents such a dated, misogynist persona at times that he makes even Bond's view of women look respectful. Shatner's acting, apart from his own ego, is what always carried the story, but I must acknowledge the most popular character, and the only truly unique one among the main cast, Mr.Spock. When Roddenberry dreamed him up, and thanks to Leonard Nimoy's infusion of deep facets within the logic driven alien, Spock was the one who actually saved the day and raised the shows profile and allowed for long-term popularity and imitation. Star Trek, like the Beatles, remains a milestone of the genre, and, somewhat similar to '2001 A Space Odyssey', ages extremely well. That Paramount finally decided on a motion picture with Trek 1, rather than launching a new network (at that time, in the late 70's) on the back of Star Trek's resurgence in popularity is a blessing.

From precocious, spoiled, all singing, all dancing brat, to hateful, spiteful, drunken, crazy woman, Bette Davis pulls off the insufferable Jane Hudson with glowering panache. She stomps, she scowls, she shouts, she rants, she simpers, she pouts and, if that weren't enough, takes great delight in tormenting and torturing her crippled sister, Blanche (whose paraplegia she caused in a drunken rage). There is nothing to touch the aging Jane with her ever so scary make up and bi-polar-esque personality. Blanche (played by Joan Crawford) is also a tour de force in this movie, but as her life is spent almost entirely 'under the thumb' of Jane, she exudes 'victim' and often a rather simpering, precious one at that, which, even if intentional, is a bit annoying to say the least. The sisters' twisted life stories have lead to their current situation with Baby Jane's career fizzling out at a very young age and Blanche's acting career taking off in young adulthood and leading to much success, fame and financial stability. Although, without question, Baby Jane, is a movie classic, watching it with a modern (and possibly jaundiced eye) one cannot but spot numerous plot inconsistencies and clunky screenplay. Why, I ask myself, would Blanche ever, have acquiesced to her bedroom being upstairs?? She's not only a blinking cripple for crying out loud, she's now an imprisoned one! Or has Blanche spent so much of her life deferring to her sister due to pity for the poor dear's failed career, nutso personality, drinking problem etc that she simply can't be assertive? . It's hard to tell, but there are certainly times when one wants to ring Blanche's neck and scream 'stop being so bloody nice to her! She's a ruddy psychopath for Chrissakes!, demand a room downstairs!'Finally, however, Blanche does wake up and smell the roses; she attempts to 'talk sense' to her demented sister about her (Jane's) 'illness' and the fact that their money is dwindling and shouldn't Jane see a doctor and stop spending so much? This sensible advice, plus Blanche's attempts at seeking help from the outside world, are the catalysts that drive Jane to ramp up her torture routine, and seek ways to bring in some cash of her own. She morphs quickly from shuffling, angry, blotto eccentric to simpering, 'controlled' (but actually madder-than-ever-woman.

Meet the Parents is a funny flick that hearkens back to the glorious late-80s, or maybe even earlier, when comedies weren't so preoccupied with shocking the audience with gross out gags or surprise twists. Most of this movie is wonderfully predictable, and aside from a few deliberately clumsy drug references and maybe a sexual innuendo or two, it was good clean fun from start to finish.Most of all, I'd say it's a good date flick to prepare yourself for the inevitable agony of meeting your own boyfriend\/girlfriend's parents. We all know it sucks. (If you don't think so, oh, just you wait. Sometimes it takes years for them to expose themselves as the hideous flesh eating monsters that they are.) De Niro manages to take us to the utter extreme of monster but without shattering our suspension of disbelief. This is a key point. If the situation were to become too absurd , we would lose focus on the story and instead hone in on the individual gags. While there are plenty of funny gags to go round, they are really just dressing on an already funny premise the story of an underdog who just cannot fit in to a judgmental bourgeois family no matter how hard (and usually because of how hard) he tries.Ben Stiller shows his acting diversity (while on a different movie set playing the terminally airheaded Zoolander) as a dorky protagonist whose best intentions are always poorly timed or received completely the wrong way.The antagonists, in this case, everybody else in the movie, tread the fine line of comedy and irritation. That is, at any time you could find yourself laughing or hating them. What's masterfully done is the filmmaker's (and of course actors') ability to turn you on a dime, take you to the edge of wanting to kill someone but then having a hearty laugh at their antics. Like I said earlier, Robert De Niro is the anchor that makes this possible, and any casting short of him (well, or maybe Christopher Walken) would have resulted in the film falling apart due to the demands it puts on our willingness to accept a complete jerk like the character he plays. Really his only redeeming quality is that he likes cats. But that's the point, I guess. No matter how rude a person may seem, there's always something redeeming in there.Well, maybe except for the hilariously loathsome airline attendant who appears in a short but pivotal role at the film's climax. To me, that scene was worth the price of admission.Don't think twice, this is a movie worth seeing. Other similar films focusing on severely dysfunctional families trying to act normally include De Niro & Billy Crystal in Analyze This, a great Andy Garcia movie called City Island and--this may be a stretch but--I think fans of Meet the Parents would really enjoy the original British Death at a Funeral (2007).

Grace , whose husband (Christopher Eccleston) has never returned from the war , becomes convinced that her family home (the house - supposedly on the island of Jersey - is actually located in the north of Spanish , in Las Fraguas , Cantabria , Palace of Hornillos) haunted while overprotecting her two young children (Alakina Mann and James Bentley were cast after an intensive search that encompassed 5,000 children). They will live alone there with oppressive, rare and almost religious rules , until she needs to hire a group of servants (Eric Sykes as Mr. Edmund Tuttle , Elaine Cassidy as Lydia and Fionnula Flanagan as Mrs. Bertha Mills) for them .The motion picture displays genuine chills , suspense, mystery and dark atmosphere with a twisted finale . Packs excellent creation of tension , thriller , emotions and terror .

Intelligent edition, special use of luxurious sets by Benjamin Fernandez and slick utilization of shock images make this one, a magnificent film .

It's not a good movie, it's not a bad movie, it simply is a pile of various bits and pieces, ranging from genius to rubbish. After several directors were fired, producer Caminito finished the movie somehow - I imagine it must have been a case of it's better to make a painful break than draw out the agony. Venice, however, is a perfect setting for a vampire movie with its ancient, dark, decaying buildings. The warm, colorful carnival scenes provide stark contrast for the cold blue light of the early morning chases when Nosferatu is looking for victims. Unfortunately, when the tension is rising, often something ridiculous happens, for example the attempt to shoot the vampire with a shotgun (results in a cannonball hole to see through) which will immediately destroy the efforts. It's too clumsy to appeal to an art movie audience (who may have enjoyed Herzog's Nosferatu) and too confusing to be Saturday night fun for horror flick fans. Under the circumstances of its production, it's no surprise that 'Nosferatu a Venezia' failed, but I admit it is at least an interesting failure which is not just another vampire movie.I watched the Italian language DVD which has no subtitles in other languages.

It's not a good movie, it's not a bad movie, it simply is a pile of various bits and pieces, ranging from genius to rubbish. After several directors were fired, producer Caminito finished the movie somehow - I imagine it must have been a case of it's better to make a painful break than draw out the agony. Venice, however, is a perfect setting for a vampire movie with its ancient, dark, decaying buildings. The warm, colorful carnival scenes provide stark contrast for the cold blue light of the early morning chases when Nosferatu is looking for victims. Unfortunately, when the tension is rising, often something ridiculous happens, for example the attempt to shoot the vampire with a shotgun (results in a cannonball hole to see through) which will immediately destroy the efforts. It's too clumsy to appeal to an art movie audience (who may have enjoyed Herzog's Nosferatu) and too confusing to be Saturday night fun for horror flick fans. Under the circumstances of its production, it's no surprise that 'Nosferatu a Venezia' failed, but I admit it is at least an interesting failure which is not just another vampire movie.I watched the Italian language DVD which has no subtitles in other languages.
