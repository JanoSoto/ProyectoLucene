After watching The Big Lebosky I found out just how talented these writer\/director's were. The Big Lebosky is a genre trend setting masterpiece. With dialogue so close to perfection I would not change a single sentence. This is a movie of pure clever genius and has tremendous replay and stay power. Mark my words when I say You can watch it a million times, and you will never get sick of it.The story begins with the raspy southern drawl of The Stranger(Sam Elliot) preparing us with narration as the ever schlepped Dude (Jeff Bridges, Jeff Lebosky) isreturning home from buying some milk at the grocery store.Upon arriving home he is greeted by a couple of Jackie Treehorn's (notorious pornography producer) looking for Jeff Lebosky After realizing that theDude was not in fact the right Jeff Lebosky (and one pee'd on rug and thus plot set up later)The Henchmen exit. Thus we are brought along on one of the funniest and darkest tales of redemption, slacking, anger, mistaken identity, and league bowling! I can honestly say the best ride of my life was on the not so righteousand lethargic tale of The Dude While he tries to seek reparation for the soiled upon rug in his living room, and finds himself in the midst of doing so, getting involved with so many different forms of deception, unwanted responsibility and paranoia as The Dude agrees to act as courier when the other millionaire Jeffery Lebosky's(David Huddleston) kidnapped trophy wife Bunny(Tara reed) allegedly gets kidnapped.Needless to say The Dude is in well over his head and Murphy's Law soon becomes reality to the motley crue of characters .This movie is so cleverly written you wonder just how the plot gets pulled off with such grace. And the answer to that question lays in the A. The dialogue B. The character development And C. The amazing acting from the entire castAs also starring Walter Sobcheck(John Goodman) Theodore(Donny) Karabatsos(Steve Buscemi)Maude Lebosky(Julianne Moore)Guest starring Jesus Quintana(John Turtorro) Brandt(Phillip Seymour Hoffman)ETC.And all these actors, no matter how small the part all make a juxtaposing impact On the all around greatness factor of this films hilarity and tightness But make sure you relax your face muscles the night before watching this moviebecause the best of the best in my personal opinion comes from The Dude and Walter(Bridges and Goodman) as The Dudes Pacifism mentality counteracts with the Ever un predictable and over steam headed Vietnam veteran Walter Sobcheck(Goodman)who will take any chance he can get to turn a conversation into reminiscing about his life in the war. With that being said Also turning in an unforgettable performance is Julianne Moore as Maude Lebosky the daughter of millionaire business man Jeffrey Lebosky(Dave Huddleston) The on screen chemistry between these cast members is extremely memorable and sometimes confrontational, but always entertaining and clever. When you view it for yourself, You'll find yourself quoting and watching in awe,as these actors quickly become your bowling buddies and transform the silver screen into pure gold. this masterpiece of satirical cinema will intrigue your intellect and challenge your sense of humor and boundaries as The Big Lebosky will invade your personal space by remaining in your mind and everyday references of the films idiosyncrasies will become adjacent to your vocabulary. Pare all that with the groundbreaking camera work and all star soundtrack and you have a film that comes as close to perfection as you will ever find.All in all and pound for pound The Big Lebosky is a 10!

It's very well watchable but as a genre movie its too lacking in its story and execution of it. With all of its praising this movie is receiving on here, it surely is a bit of an overrated movie.Problem for me while watching this movie was that I knew that this was simply the type of movie in which nothing is what it seems, which made me all the more aware all of the time, making me see lots of the twists within this movie from miles away already. The movie was just being a bit too obvious with its intentions and what directions it was heading toward. The movie therefore wasn't really being very surprising, despite having more than a few twists to its story. Also a bit too many perhaps. It's best to have one big twist at the ending than to have multiple twists throughout its entire story. It's just less effective and powerful.Guess its a good enough first theatrical directorial movie debut for Bill Paxton, who doesn't provide the movie with a good style or distinctive atmosphere but nevertheless sets the right mood and knows to tell the story, despite the story not being all that great. The movie never made it to most cinemas though and its not hard to see way. The movie is too typical for its genre and it doesn't stand out in any way. Movies like this get made by the dozens each year, especially during those days and there simply are far better and more surprising genre movies to watch out there.For his first big movie Bill Paxton knew to get some big names involved.

You might see it that way because it's one of those films that boils down to a showdown &#x96; of the sporting variety, in which the man of the hour Rocky Balboa fights high-prize fighter and king of the boxing world Apollo Creed for the right to be the best. But getting there is the joy in Rocky; getting there is not about sports but about life, companionship, living, just generally surviving less than pleasant conditions but most importantly belief, the belief and eternal optimism that something good might well lurk around the corner. Sure, Rocky boxes but it's a hobby, a hobby that he can't really nail for whatever financial or lack-of-skills reason. But what the film is, is a rising through the ranks of life; a look at an individual whom nobody would usually batter five-seconds worth of an eyelid to, and his rise to a chance at something.By the time the fight has finished, the filmmakers have chopped about so much and got across such a feeling of awe that it doesn't matter to us, nor the characters, who wins or what's going on. What is for 80% of the time a slow burning and very intriguing character study of people, shot on and around the streets of Philadelphia, suddenly becomes a frantic and quite deliberately messy blur of fists and hard bodies slugging it out in an indoor arena housing thousands. But it's a deliberate tactic, to throw aside all the realism and long takes of human beings engaging in human activity and sharing human emotions, and replace it with chaotic fighting to the point we may have to just glance away.There is a scene during which Rocky, played by Sylvester Stallone, is talking to a bartender about life. It captures the hypothesis of the film as dialogue about 'everybody gets their chance' and that 'there is always a moment when a nobody gets the chance to be a somebody' is played out. The film begins with a boxing match, a match that Rocky wins, but what follows are several scenes revolving around day-to-day life as it is revealed Rocky is nothing more than a money collector for a local criminal. The film deconstructs the idea of a boxer and does so through Rocky, a person that uses his fists to earn money but is a delicate, modest person whom you'd be hard pressed immediately label 'bad'.This notion is done so through the slightest of subtle hints to actual events and interactions with other characters. At one point, Rocky opts against breaking the thumb of a man who owes money to Rocky's employer on the basis of pity, but maybe we're not convinced this is anything special on Rocky's behalf. At other times, he bosses a delicate situation with a naive girl following a date that shouldn't have been but does so in a careful enough manner, suggesting and promising there's more to him than his boxing and crime-led line of work. Additionally, he keeps pet turtles, which he bought at the pet store said girl, named Adrianna (Shire), works. He takes care of them and they are delicate &#x96; going so far as to get their bowl and furniture just right so they don't feel uncomfortable as pets. Eventually, it is the audience seduced into liking him, and from whence comes the overwhelming fondness for the character.Rocky has a friend named Paulie (Young), who is a butcher of sorts, and doubles up as Adrianna's brother. He carries a certain aggressiveness to him, a character working along-side the protagonist but not as a foil so much as a visual representation of incorrect or 'wrong' beliefs. Rocky's attitude and spoken tone is conflicted to that of Paulie's outgoing, loud and aggressive attributes. In fact, so much of the film is this grounded and realistic look at everyday people doing everyday things that the film needs to pull a proverbial rabbit out of the hat to bring together Rocky and his destiny that is this championship fight. The event that acts as the catalyst is Creed's opponent pulling out of the scheduled fight and Creed himself handpicking 'The Italian Stallion' that is Rocky Balboa to fill in; on America's Day of Independence; which Creed sees as a would-be walkover victory, something that'll only confirm his superiority.But there's the first mistake, something that the audience themselves may well have been roped into making in the first place, and that's underestimation. The film highlights the arrogance supposedly superior forces have over their smaller opponents, a brushing aside of something deemed inferior or not immediately assumed to be 'of the standard'. If the film is an underdog story, then it has no shame in recognising itself as such. At one point, Rocky employs the help of Mickey Goldmill (Meredith), an ex-boxer from another generation, as a coach or 'mentor' to get him ready for the fight and seeds of doubt are planted within Creed's head when a TV interview shows Rocky as someone who perhaps means business. The film is completely unashamed in labelling Mickey as a mentor.The film captures how we feel about the fight perfectly. The result is not important. If the film had been primarily a boxing film, the fight would've meant more to its characters than usual and the film peels off for its look at romance just as much as it does its social commentary on the quality of living, in a place and at a time. The film lends more time to the development of Adrianna and Rocky as well as Rocky's getting by in life more than it does boxing and training for boxing, thus we (as do the characters) care more for the result of that romance than any boxing result. The film deserves the praise and attention its garnered. ","genre":null},{"date":"11 April 2009","score":"","review":" Is Rocky really a 'sports movie'?

In fact, so much of the film is this grounded and realistic look at everyday people doing everyday things that the film needs to pull a proverbial rabbit out of the hat to bring together Rocky and his destiny that is this championship fight. The event that acts as the catalyst is Creed's opponent pulling out of the scheduled fight and Creed himself handpicking 'The Italian Stallion' that is Rocky Balboa to fill in; on America's Day of Independence; which Creed sees as a would-be walkover victory, something that'll only confirm his superiority.But there's the first mistake, something that the audience themselves may well have been roped into making in the first place, and that's underestimation. The film highlights the arrogance supposedly superior forces have over their smaller opponents, a brushing aside of something deemed inferior or not immediately assumed to be 'of the standard'. If the film is an underdog story, then it has no shame in recognising itself as such. At one point, Rocky employs the help of Mickey Goldmill (Meredith), an ex-boxer from another generation, as a coach or 'mentor' to get him ready for the fight and seeds of doubt are planted within Creed's head when a TV interview shows Rocky as someone who perhaps means business. The film is completely unashamed in labelling Mickey as a mentor.The film captures how we feel about the fight perfectly. The result is not important. If the film had been primarily a boxing film, the fight would've meant more to its characters than usual and the film peels off for its look at romance just as much as it does its social commentary on the quality of living, in a place and at a time. The film lends more time to the development of Adrianna and Rocky as well as Rocky's getting by in life more than it does boxing and training for boxing, thus we (as do the characters) care more for the result of that romance than any boxing result. The film deserves the praise and attention its garnered.

Along with The Munsters, which came out at almost the exact same time, it offered up a cheerfully morbid account of a spooky, bizarre family living in the heart of suburban normalcy. Although it only lasted two seasons, The Addams Family has gone on to become an iconic sitcom, with no signs of it ever losing its popularity.In 1990, Paramount put up the funds for a Hollywood feature film of The Addams Family. Something that had never really been attempted before. Where all of the old familiar characters are played by new actors, and the series is redressed for the big screen. After the film was a big hit, many others jumped on the bandwagon, turning well-remembered TV shows into features. But many of them have wound up dismal failures. Perhaps because what works on the small screen doesn't always work so well when stretched to fill out a big one.Also, when The Addams Family was made, the whole idea of seeing a time-honoured show as a film was a fresh idea and not the tired cliché it seems today. And happily The Addams Family is one of the few that succeeds. Largely through Barry Sonnenfeld's confident direction and a perfectly chosen cast. When it comes to actresses playing Morticia, there are few suited to the role like Anjelica Huston. Covered in a striking white makeup job, shocking red lips and black spider dress, she couldn't be more perfect. She carries herself through the film with a real regal authority, and although she looks like a walking corpse, she's just as sensual as Carolyn Jones ever was.The late Raul Julia makes Gomez into more of a swashbuckler then John Astin did, but he's also an excellent choice. He throws himself into the role with perfect reckless abandon. He also has great chemistry with Huston, making their morbid love for one another that all the more fun to watch. Christopher Lloyd makes it a hat-trick as Uncle Fester. Virtually buried beneath a fat suit and tons of makeup, he's an astonishing dead ringer for Jackie Coogan. He's even got a similar high voice. Charles Addams would have been proud. The success of the film lies as much in the hands of the casting department as it does in the hands of Barry Sonnenfeld.The Addams Family was Barry Sonnenfeld's debut as director after working as a cinematographer for several years. Usually on Coen films. And working for the Coen Brothers has clearly rubbed off on Sonnenfeld. He seems most at home in the world of black comedy. Something Coen films are renowned for. Which is what makes him such a perfect choice to direct an Addams Family picture. He captures the blackly comical life of the Addams Family perfectly. He never takes the story too far over the top (not until Wild Wild West anyway), and he keeps things ticking along at a sprightly pace.As his later films would prove, Barry Sonnenfeld is only as good as the script he's been given. And scriptwriters Caroline Thompson and Larry Wilson do a good job of providing him with one. Some of the gags are a bit obvious (I'll sell you a box of Girl Scout Cookies. Are they made from real Girl Scouts?), but where the film shines is watching the Addams Family reacting to the strange with perfect acceptance. They cut the heads off roses. Come after one another with butcher knives. Even the rack is pleasant to them.But even funnier is the second half where after the Addams' have been ousted from their home, we watch them trying to fit in to normal society.

The film pretends to be a straight story, the cosy adventure of a heroic old man who travels across America to visit his brother, but is many ways a tale every bit as terrifying as Lynch's other features.Story begins with shots of a Midwestern night sky. Lynch tells us its a cosmic graveyard, each star representative of passed on human spirits (Lynch believes in this New Age nonsense, so we'll allow the hokiness). We then get several melancholic shots of a small Iowan town. It's all quite peaceful, until Lynch begins to dwell on the grotesque. And so we see an ugly women, obsessed with beauty products, munching on food out in her garden. She's so self-absorbed she doesn't notice her neighbour, the elderly Mr Alvin Straight, collapsing in his home.Alvin is then taken to a doctor. His legs no longer work and so he is given two walking canes. The doctor says he'll be dead soon but Alvin doesn't share this news with his daughter. He says I'll live to a hundred, Alvin lies. As the film progresses, it's clear that Alvin Straight isn't ever straight with anyone. Alvin's daughter is called Rose, but there's nothing rosy about her life. She has a mental disability and makes bird houses. Why houses? Because she lost her four children to the state when a fire destroyed her home. It wasn't Rose's fault, though. She had left her kids in the care of someone else. But who was this someone else? Alvin, after learning that his brother suffered a stroke, sets off to visit his sibling in Mount Zion, a place, we assume, of symbolic redemption. But Alvin can't legally drive (he has no license), and so he hops on board his reds lawnmower and sets off on a slow journey. Unfortunately Alvin's mower promptly stops working. He responds by taking out a gun and putting it down like a wounded animal. This is the first sign that there is some violence buried deep within Alvin.From here on the film tells its tale via several symbolic episodes. Alvin upgrades to a green 66 John Dere lawnmower and passes an old woman whose dead husband rode a reds. He then meets a young girl who says she's running away from her parents. This mirrors Rose wishing she hadn't lost her kids. Later, Alvin's pathetic lawnmower is overtaken by a crowd of young bicyclists and huge, virile trucks. Worse part of being old is remembering when you was young, he says later. Death is approaching the old man, but what he really means is that he hates remembering what he did when he was young. He wants to atone for some hidden past.Alvin then meets a woman who has bizarrely run over 14 deer on the highway. We recall that Alvin had fourteen kids. That's a big family, but where have they all gone? Dead on a highway? Driven apart by something? Alvin, who throughout the film is associated with meat and carnality, later guiltily eats the dead road kill whilst four deer sculptures loom over his shoulder. Didn't Rose have four children? The next day Alvin mounts the deer's antlers on his John Deer lawnmower.Alvin approaches a hill, his brakes failing when he notices a burning house in the distance. The audience recalls that Rose's children were lost in a fire. Alvin, now without mower, spends the night camping out in a family's garden whilst he waits for his mower to be fixed. He makes it clear that he doesn't feel worthy enough to step foot in their home. The nice family's modern cordless phone is contrasted with Alvin's old wired phone. They are free, Alvin is weighed down by something.Later, Alvin shares a beer with an old man. He talks about how he used to be an alcoholic, using booze to get rid of the trauma of war, and how a priest cured him of his disease when he got back to America. But is this true? If Alvin gave up drinking shortly after WW2, why did drink cause the fight with his brother Lyle? Meanwhile, a man plays with a knife in the bar.Alvin meets two brothers who constantly argue. One has a bandage on his chin. He's been cut. In the next scene, Alvin makes a stop at another bar. He's on the verge of seeing his brother for the first time in years and now here he is, seeking solace in the beverage that drove them apart?The film ends with Alvin driving his mower up to Lyle's house. His engine mysteriously shuts down. He's unable to go through with it, unable to face his brother, unable to look his sibling in the face. A bigger tractor then approaches, shaming Alvin into completing his journey. Alvin then ambles up to Lyle's house and sits with his brother out on the front porch. They are Cain and Abel (Alvlin with two walking canes, Lyle with his able walker), looking mournfully up at the night sky; imminent death will end their torment.And so we have the tale of a man who returned from war a violent brute. He impregnated his wife, beat his children and was disowned by his family. Alvin then became an abusive drunk who cut his brother and lost his daughter's kids in a fire. A man who lost control of his car, lost his license, lost his wife and lost his own kids in an accident. And so Alvin Straight is riding his mower, not as an act of forgiveness, but as an ordeal of atonement. Actor Richard Farnsworth, who plays Alvin, would commit suicide soon after. Creepily fitting.9\/10 - Worth multiple viewings.

He responds by taking out a gun and putting it down like a wounded animal. This is the first sign that there is some violence buried deep within Alvin.From here on the film tells its tale via several symbolic episodes. Alvin upgrades to a green 66 John Dere lawnmower and passes an old woman whose dead husband rode a reds. He then meets a young girl who says she's running away from her parents. This mirrors Rose wishing she hadn't lost her kids. Later, Alvin's pathetic lawnmower is overtaken by a crowd of young bicyclists and huge, virile trucks. Worse part of being old is remembering when you was young, he says later. Death is approaching the old man, but what he really means is that he hates remembering what he did when he was young. He wants to atone for some hidden past.Alvin then meets a woman who has bizarrely run over 14 deer on the highway. We recall that Alvin had fourteen kids. That's a big family, but where have they all gone? Dead on a highway? Driven apart by something? Alvin, who throughout the film is associated with meat and carnality, later guiltily eats the dead road kill whilst four deer sculptures loom over his shoulder. Didn't Rose have four children? The next day Alvin mounts the deer's antlers on his John Deer lawnmower.Alvin approaches a hill, his brakes failing when he notices a burning house in the distance. The audience recalls that Rose's children were lost in a fire. Alvin, now without mower, spends the night camping out in a family's garden whilst he waits for his mower to be fixed. He makes it clear that he doesn't feel worthy enough to step foot in their home. The nice family's modern cordless phone is contrasted with Alvin's old wired phone. They are free, Alvin is weighed down by something.Later, Alvin shares a beer with an old man. He talks about how he used to be an alcoholic, using booze to get rid of the trauma of war, and how a priest cured him of his disease when he got back to America. But is this true? If Alvin gave up drinking shortly after WW2, why did drink cause the fight with his brother Lyle? Meanwhile, a man plays with a knife in the bar.Alvin meets two brothers who constantly argue. One has a bandage on his chin. He's been cut. In the next scene, Alvin makes a stop at another bar. He's on the verge of seeing his brother for the first time in years and now here he is, seeking solace in the beverage that drove them apart?The film ends with Alvin driving his mower up to Lyle's house. His engine mysteriously shuts down. He's unable to go through with it, unable to face his brother, unable to look his sibling in the face. A bigger tractor then approaches, shaming Alvin into completing his journey. Alvin then ambles up to Lyle's house and sits with his brother out on the front porch. They are Cain and Abel (Alvlin with two walking canes, Lyle with his able walker), looking mournfully up at the night sky; imminent death will end their torment.And so we have the tale of a man who returned from war a violent brute. He impregnated his wife, beat his children and was disowned by his family. Alvin then became an abusive drunk who cut his brother and lost his daughter's kids in a fire. A man who lost control of his car, lost his license, lost his wife and lost his own kids in an accident. And so Alvin Straight is riding his mower, not as an act of forgiveness, but as an ordeal of atonement. Actor Richard Farnsworth, who plays Alvin, would commit suicide soon after.

The film pretends to be a straight story, the cosy adventure of a heroic old man who travels across America to visit his brother, but is many ways a tale every bit as terrifying as Lynch's other features.Story begins with shots of a Midwestern night sky. Lynch tells us its a cosmic graveyard, each star representative of passed on human spirits (Lynch believes in this New Age nonsense, so we'll allow the hokiness). We then get several melancholic shots of a small Iowan town. It's all quite peaceful, until Lynch begins to dwell on the grotesque. And so we see an ugly women, obsessed with beauty products, munching on food out in her garden. She's so self-absorbed she doesn't notice her neighbour, the elderly Mr Alvin Straight, collapsing in his home.Alvin is then taken to a doctor. His legs no longer work and so he is given two walking canes. The doctor says he'll be dead soon but Alvin doesn't share this news with his daughter. He says I'll live to a hundred, Alvin lies. As the film progresses, it's clear that Alvin Straight isn't ever straight with anyone. Alvin's daughter is called Rose, but there's nothing rosy about her life. She has a mental disability and makes bird houses. Why houses? Because she lost her four children to the state when a fire destroyed her home. It wasn't Rose's fault, though. She had left her kids in the care of someone else. But who was this someone else? Alvin, after learning that his brother suffered a stroke, sets off to visit his sibling in Mount Zion, a place, we assume, of symbolic redemption.

However I feel that The Empire Strikes Back is easily the greatest film of the series and one of the greatest films ever made.The rebels are forced to flee from the ice planet of Hoth after the Imperials discovered their hideout there. Solo, Leia, Chewbacca, and c 3P0 take off in the Millennium Falcon. Luke meanwhile travels to the Dagobah System to learn from the jedi master Yoda. Darth Vader then puts all his efforts into capturing the Millennium Falcon as to lure Skywalker to him. Vader then plans to turn Skywalker over to the dark side of the force.The main reason for this film being awesome is that there is so much going on. There really is no main setting and instead see various awesome settings. The ice planet hoth, swampy Dagobah system, asteroid field, cloud city of Bespin; it just is great how there are so many different places where action takes place in this film.The action in this film is legendary. Battle of Hoth is awesome and the imperial AT AT walkers are really a spectacle to behold. The asteroid field chase with the millennium falcon is also great. Also who can forget the legendary lightsaber duel at the end between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. I certainly never will forget that duel, to me that is the best moment in Star Wars history.This film does an awesome job developing characters. Solo and Leia develop a romantic relationship that I think fits the film well. Also the character of Chewbacca is portrayed more as a great companion and useful at helping out rather than just as a lumbering brute as he is in the first film. Luke starts to use the force more and develop into a jedi. Darth Vader also goes from being just an evil villain in the first film and becomes a legendary villain also capable of making outstanding strategies. Vader in this film is the greatest villain I have seen in a film and the way that he is portrayed in this film is awesome and the best portrayal of a villain in a film.New characters are added in this film. Lando Calrissen gets his first appearance. I do not really like or dislike Lando that much. Yoda make his first appearance in the Star Wars franchise. Who can not like Yoda? Yoda is easily one of the most powerful presences in a film and a master of the force. Frank Oz does an awesome job portraying Yoda. But to me the best new character in this film is Boba Fett. Fett is a great bounty hunter who will hunt down people in constant pursuit. Fett is my favorite Star Wars character and he adds to the films overall tone of suspense and unease in this film.The music is phenomenal in this film. This is the first film to use the Imperial March song and that film goes great with Darth Vader. When it is played at the same time as when Vader is on screen it is outstanding. Easily one of the best musical scores ever in a film, hats off to John Williams.

There really is no main setting and instead see various awesome settings. The ice planet hoth, swampy Dagobah system, asteroid field, cloud city of Bespin; it just is great how there are so many different places where action takes place in this film.The action in this film is legendary. Battle of Hoth is awesome and the imperial AT AT walkers are really a spectacle to behold. The asteroid field chase with the millennium falcon is also great. Also who can forget the legendary lightsaber duel at the end between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. I certainly never will forget that duel, to me that is the best moment in Star Wars history.This film does an awesome job developing characters.

The DVD is simply basic, no extras!), its been a while since I saw for the very first time this Criterion DVD at my local store and since then I came across with it many times but just this week I finally decided to get it. Certainly The Night Porter was not one of my must-wanted films from the Criterion Collection (right now I can't wait to get and see for the very first time Eyes Without a Face, The Pornographers, White Dog and Mafioso), certainly if you read the reviews on here you will find more or less divided opinions, anyway I will give you my humble opinion of this film. The film has two very defined parts, I found myself very interested during the first part of the film and after Dirk Bogarde and Charlotte Rampling's characters (Bogarde is Max and Rampling is Lucia) are together again I felt we could have much more. During the first part of the film we were going to see something planned, something that our protagonist Max was going to be part of, something that was going to be practically routine. Well I haven't mention this yet so here it is Max is a former SS Officer, the film begins when is 1957 and we are in Vienna where Max works as the night porter of a hotel. We meet other former SS Officers, they and Max certainly know that Max's trial is very near so we were going to see the planned thing, routine for the former SS Officers, another case but this one seemed easy, after all there are not witnesses to testify against you remarks one of Max former SS comrades but by then the expression of Max that we only see is according to what happened before we even knew about Max's past, is according to what allowed us to see something of Max's past. So the change will happen, after all everyone noted how strange Max began to act, I don't know anything about a woman, certainly bullshit so it will be Max and his little girl together again and now 'till death do us part.

So advanced, in fact, has the American West become that its cowboys must seek out action over the national border in primitive Mexico, where oppressed civilians fight valiantly, with minimal resources, to overthrow the resident dictatorship of General Mapache (Emilio Fernández); it is only in these revolutionists that the heroic spirit of the Old West survives. Aside from Angel (Jaime Sánchez), who is fighting for an ideal, there is not a single noble character in the film, not even the law-enforcer (Albert Dekker), who arrogantly and cowardly bullies criminal bounty-hunters into doing his work.The surviving outlaws of the Old West &#x96; William Holden, Ernest Borgnine, Robert Ryan, Edmond O'Brien &#x96; cling to the tattered vestiges of their former ways, embracing an outdated code of honour that feels woefully inadequate in the modern world they are unchanged men in a changing land. Out of step, out of place, and desperately out of time. But unlike 'Ride the High Country,' which featured genre stalwarts Joel McCrea and Randolph Scott as washed-up Western heroes, none of the Wild Bunch ever were heroes.

Such a choice with Le Mépris (Contempt) yields a radically different experience, well beyond the mere question of subtitles.The story tells of the making of a movie in Italy with an American producer, an Austrian director, plus a script doctor and his beautiful wife. The French version is multilingual. Whereas the English-American and Italian versions are entirely dubbed. Crucially, in the English-American version, the producer seems to be followed about by a quirky assistant who paraphrases the somewhat vainglorious proclamations of her boss for the benefit of other mere mortals. Only in the French version, is it apparent she is an interpreter.This is important, as one of the themes of Le Mépris is the breakdown of communication. Not only are the producer and director at odds with each other, but the marital breakdown of the script doctor and his wife (played by Michel Piccoli and the glamorous Brigitte Bardot) is placed under the microscope. Three further parallels are neatly woven into our story. One is the tale of Ulysses separated from his wife Penelope, in which he is protected by Minerva but threatened by Neptune (Homer's Odyssey is the subject of the film-within-a-film). Second is an examination of the gap between cinema-for-profit and cinema-as-art, partly mirrored in the Le Mépris' actual production as well as in its subject matter. And third are autobiographical references to Godard's personal life &#x96; both his love life and his life as a filmmaker. Whereas the French version of the movie raises serious questions about the film industry, about the relationship between man and the gods, and even explores some of the more challenging questions about love, life and Homer's work; in the English-American version these things become like added confectionery, arty flourishes for more passive audiences. Or for whom the challenge of discovering cinematic jokes within references to Rio Bravo and works by Fritz Lang (who plays himself as a director) become an intellectual conceit.Brigitte Bardot here finds at once both a self-consciously iconic and a substantial acting role. On the one hand, her acting talents are utilised to greater effect than in many of her films. On the other, long (soft-core) nude scenes are both complicit in, and critical of, her sex-goddess status. The opening scene, where she teasingly asks her husband which part of her body he finds most attractive, was added at the insistence of the film's American co-producers. Yet its mocking style is almost a lampoon of the use of sex to sell big budget U.S. films. The film-within-a-film's American producer, Jeremy Prokosch (played by Jack Palance), is visibly more enthusiastic about scenes involving nakedness than any faithfulness to the spirit of Homer. Director Fritz Lang, in contrast, goes to great length to examine the essence of the Odyssey, using Dante's Inferno and a poem by Friedrich Holderlin. The gods are created by men, not vice versa, and create the challenges Odysseus is forced to face. It is an easy step to observe how the American producer, throwing his weight around in 'godlike' fashion, both misses this point and actually identifies with the lesser 'gods' of sex and wealth. These gods &#x96; in the form of a much-needed cheque for Piccoli's character and the dangling of Bardot's allures before Prokosch, threaten both the marriage and the integrity of the film-within-a-film. Contempt breeds among the characters and begets tragedy.Piccoli also has a great line about exploitation Usually, when you see women, they're dressed. But put them in a movie, and you see their backsides. As if to underline the point, Prokosch casually has his assistant bend over so he can use her (clothed) backside as a table to sign a cheque. His imperious and lecherous attitude dovetails the 'Americanised' scenes that show naked women's backsides without explicitness. They contrast strongly against the clothed Bardot who is portrayed as an intelligent woman able to hold her own.This film is one of the most rounded of any of Godard's work and can easily be viewed as 'mainstream' &#x96; the more philosophical riddles being purely optional. And if Godard is displaying contempt for the prostituting of cinematic art to big business &#x96; principally American big studios &#x96; the style is still reverential towards his American heroes Le Mépris has been accurately described as, Hawks and Hitchcock shot in the manner of Antonioni. Godard, like Ulysses and Piccoli's character, has both engaged with the enemy - American producer Joseph E Levine (Neptune, Prokosch) and prevailed. He has not 'sold-out' to big finance but, like Ulysses on coming home, merely disguised himself as a beggar to better elicit the truth. 'Minerval' wisdom shines through (especially from the mouth of his hero-in-exile, Fritz Lang, with lines that reflect Godard's philosophy). When Bardot's character Camille wears a black wig, she resembles Godard's wife Anna Karina. Her story, subjected to unwanted attentions while her husband is absent, parallels Penelope.By many sleights of hand, Godard continues to 'explore the uninhabited world' and simultaneously produce a film for many different audiences. Le Mépris is very clever and enjoyable to watch, but does it have anything new to say? Or is it an exquisite exercise in admiring its own limitations? The films strengths are less obvious than the overtly cinematic and revolutionary Breathless, or the philosophically challenging 2 or 3 Things I Know About Her. It has as much depth as you wish to find in it, and is more convincing than his disjointed political diatribes. But, unlike all those films, it can also be overlooked as little more than a pleasant experience. Especially by anyone who thinks it would be simpler if we all spoke the same language.

I believe Dirty Harry to be as much as an exploitation\/political statement as much as it is a feature film. It's the dirty, hard gritty grimy slummy nasty scum riddled streets of San Francisco. The film se7en is also all of the above (bar the setting), but se7en raises the bar in terms of violence, and so it falls out of the category that Dirty Harry has created for itself and stands alone in.Clint Eastwood portrays Harry Callahan, a tough, un-compromising homicide cop whose first case is the murder of a woman in the scope of the infamous Scorpio killer. The plot is very straight forward and requires no hard thinking whatsoever. The plot is in fact as far as I am concerned secondary. It is the 'tour' we are taken on shot in a very basic documentarian fashion. It's eye though highly polished cannot hide its grain, even on Blu Ray disk. It is that which perhaps holds the most significance.There are no fancy camera angles, no special effects, no sunshine and flowers. This is a hard 70's cop film that pulls no punches whatsoever. The violence though strong is not stylalised. The images we see are dark and cold and the music that accompanies is of sadness when not picking up that famous 70's pace.The story takes us down the alleys and backstreets, into peoples lives where vice and homosexuality and cop hate are rampant. Everything is sordid and there is little in the way of humour or romance. That said, it contains the very famous monologue in the beginning that is mirrored in the end and in my opinion, part of what elevates this piece of cinema to it's status.In the beginning Callahan is mocking, being smart with the crook who's bank heist he foiled with the 44 magnum. In the end, his expression and actions complete a full circle. Yet there is no happy music and victory. He has stopped (by playing against the rules) the truly infamous bastard of a homicidal maniac. Andrew Robinson is Oscar worthy. I don't know if he received an accolade for this. I'm guessing that upon release the film had to surf an onslaught of political outrage. Harry does not save the girl, her limp naked body is pulled from the drainage and the evils of mankind are realised.To summarise, it's an important film. It is hard cinema, but for the discerning palette it is a must watch must own if only on the principle of being a film fan.
