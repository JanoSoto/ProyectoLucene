It was based on a 300 page (fairly easy to adapt) world record breaking novel that in the opinion of many is one of the best books ever written. When it was announced that director Chris Columbus would helm the project, many moaned and groaned, his previous works have lacked in... erm... entertainment. Steve Kloves was assigned to adapt, Kloves is not as seasoned a man as several other talented screenwriters. So we now have a mediocre director and screenwriter assigned to one of the potentially greatest films of all time. It was expected that the actors who would eventually play the trio would have to be 'green' (unexperienced) because veteran child actors are often not right for franchise roles. So a new ensemble, a poor director, and a mediocre screenwriter. But it could still have come out good right?... WRONG! Chris Columbus' direction was absolutely appalling! His incoherent transitions, unchanging camera angles, lack of any use of dolly shots, over-use of tracking shots, monotonous lighting, and complete ignorance to inform his actors how to actually act, immediately contributed to the collapse of this picture. Kloves' writing didn't contribute any quality to the abysmal film either. The novel was an epic written as an epic, described as an epic, and sold as an epic. So why was the script written like a quirky independent film? Furthermore the CGI in this film (despite Columbus' excuses of time restrictions) INEXCUSABLE! You do not have ghosts float in 2D patterns as though designed on Apple iMovie when you have a budget exceeds 100 Million dollars! Now The Ensemble. Too many reviews have been published tearing apart the acting of the three actors portraying the most well known characters in history. So I won't... JUST KIDDING! The acting was and remains now, encased in DVD releases, some of the worst in cinema history. You mean? That thing was Voldemort? was meant to be spoken in a spine-chilling and dragged-out way that made the audience cringe in terrifying realization, and was instead spoken as though Harry Potter had stumbled upon a surprise party. Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson deliver some of the MOST irritatingly bad lines ever spoken, it's rather easy to simply learn to not over-act, to not under-act, to just act! Espesially in a role so perfectly described in books. Rupert Grint was tolerable. The movie was an enormous insult to the well-written book of the same name and despite the hype surrounding the apparent attraction ten year old girls have to Daniel Radcliffe (whose normal weight does not fit the skinny persona described in the book) and the amazing (gag) special effect, most critics and fans alike cannot bare to even watch the film a first or for those unfortunate ones like myself a second time.

I have had more success in compiling a list of Desert Island Movies, however those films that I could bear to watch over-and-over if they were the only ones I had. 2 Bob Zemeckis films make that list (Back to the Future is the other one, and Who Framed Roger Rabbit? comes close.) Every time I rewatch it, I find new things to appreciate without losing any of the magic it contains. The opening sequence in particular is still one of the finest ever committed to film - I'm glad I saw it in the cinema but even on the small screen it loses little of its power.As other reviewers have noted, intelligent SF is a rarity in films. And this is clearly very much a science fiction movie. What makes Contact so extraordinary is that it also respects religion without trivialising either component, and challenges the viewer all the way through to stay one step ahead whilst still surprising you at every turn; the false-ending after the first machine explodes has to be up there with the very best.There are some holes to pick - ultimately, the big reveal at the end is less of a kicker than it should be (there would be other things to explain beyond just the static tape, and the whole hoax concept is just far too easy to rip to pieces), but that's not the point. What you get are a collection of marvellous performances, including Matthew McConaughy, who I usually can't abide, and a brilliantly creepy turn by Tom Skerritt, combined with silky smooth direction and a screenplay that expects you to follow what is going on - taking the ideas in Carl Sagan's original novel and extending them in ways that could only be done on screen. The biggest coup for me was making the climax of the film nothing to do with her close encounter at all, but the big showdown in Congress - a remarkable achievement but one that succeeds in bringing closure to the story in a way that Sagan's book never quite managed.Literally the only thing that dates this film is the (somewhat clumsy) inclusion of stock footage of President Bill Clinton. Otherwise, I could see this film being released today without any trouble - and probably receiving much the same reception from many critics too smart, too understated, too preachy.

A film known as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.The film begins with a sequence of brief, unsettling images of a decomposing corpse while a distant, ghostly voice informs us that someone has been making a macabre form of art out of long-buried human bodies. We are then introduced to a group of happy-go-lucky teens on their way to a remote, run-down mansion. On their way, they pick up a hitchhiker, who, after a rather awkward conversation, proceeds to cut himself and one of the teens. The teens quickly throw him out of their van and continue on their way. Once at the mansion, two of the teens begin to explore out back. They come across a house. And with the quick smack of a hammer to a forehead, the film turns into a non-stop ride of murder, dismemberment, cannibalism, and every form of horror you can imagine.Unlike the sleek, glossy horror films of today, Massacre has a gritty documentary feel to it, which just adds to the realism of the terror all the more. Another thing Massacre does differently than most horror films is how it approaches the violence. Throughout the film, you don't actually see a large amount of it.

Don't get me wrong, this film contains some of most horrific, disturbingly violent content ever conveyed through cinema, but the fact that most of it occurs just off camera gives the film something of a surreal feeling, reminiscent of Psycho.From the eerie opening to the rip-roaring last frame, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is an experience unlike any other. It may not be pleasant, I'm not even sure if you could call it entertaining, but it is undeniably horrific and it is something everyone should experience at least once in their lives, whether they like it or not.8.5\/10 ","genre":"Horror"},{"date":"27 August 2005","score":"","review":" Alright we're talking cultural Phenomenon here...Who Ya Gonna Call?

John Candy, Steve Martin, Eddie Murphy, Bill Murray, Dan Akroyd, these guys did their best comedy work during this time.

Some of the ghost scenes and more scary scenes are easy for adults but could be quite disturbing to children. Plus the numerous sexual situations. The cast of this film couldn't be any more perfect which is funny considering how much the cast changed from who Akroyd wanted and who they got. Bill Murray in one of his best comedic roles becomes almost over used in his portrayal as Dr. Peter Venkman. Murray has to be one of the only comedic actors who can run that borderline between being funny and cute, to being annoying and overused (ie Will Ferrell) His character runs that line but has some of the best and most memorable scenes. Akroyd's Ray Stanz is excitable and eager and holds the team together along with Harold Ramis' Egon Spengler. Ramis seems to just fit right in which is strange because he doesn't really fit the profile for the rest of the team. Sigourney Weaver as Dana Barrett, Murray's love interest and the female lead of the film does a great job as well. Her and Murray have some great scenes and she gets to go from Upper class reserved woman to possessed over sexed demon.Ernie Hudson...well Hudson is a great actor but he is underused and strangely pointless for the cast. There was never a need for a fourth ghost buster and he gets rather left out most of the time. Although he does get to deliver the infamous closing line of the film I love this town! Ivan Reitman who is an amazing director when it comes to making films that people love and making them just fun to watch does a great job of keeping everything interesting and keeping the story flowing. His idea of showing us how they got started was brilliant.

If the film is successful and looked at as a nice first piece, the director must keep it going and make an even better picture. But the real test is the first picture's appeal to audiences. It can't be dull, boring, and have a bad ending. It has to be great all the way through to the last frame. One director created a whole new type of movie...a Quentin Tarantino film...In Quentin Tarantino's film debut Reservoir Dogs, we follow a group of men who attempt to steal a shipment of diamonds. Joe (Lawrence Tierney), the organizer of the group, has hand selected each of the six men who will perform the robbery. Each is given an alias except for Joe and his son Nice Guy Eddie (Chris Penn) to hide identities in case of someone getting caught and to cover up tracks. There is Mr. White (Harvey Keitel), Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), Mr. Brown (Quentin Tarantino), Mr. Blue (Eddie Bunker), and much to his dismay there is Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi).The job appears to be simple, get in, get out, and get paid. There are eight men total and not a single one of them could ever expected what would happen. After a nice opening in a small diner and what would become the Reservoir Dogs March, we cut to Mr. White and Mr. Orange driving away really fast to the ware house where they would all meet. Mr. Orange has been tagged in the gut and is bleeding quite a bit. Mr. White has given him his real name, Larry, to comfort him. When Mr. Pink arrives shortly after them, he gives his side of the robbery gone wrong. They both agree that there is definitely a snitch in the group. During the heist, the police appeared out of nowhere almost anticipating what would play out. Mr. Blonde in a state of panic\/craziness decided to start shooting innocent people, fearing someone triggered the alarm. When the dust settled, cops were dead, civilians were dead, Mr. Orange was shot, Mr. Brown was shot in the head and believed dead, Mr. Blue was MIA, Mr. Pink and Mr. White are trying to solve everything, and Mr. Blonde has a surprise for them...a cop in a trunk. The movie takes an interesting turn as Mr. Blonde's sanity is in question and the cop is interrogated.Tarantino's unique style shines with his camera angles, music selections, and of course...his dialogue. Tarantino's writing is phenomenal and incredibly brilliant. As soon as the movie starts he thrusts us into the middle of the eight men having a conversation of breakfast. The conversation being Madonna's hit single Like a Virgin. The meaning of the song and how it was derived is brought up. Not your average movie talk, but it's just like real life. The flow and the reactions from everyone make it very real. This is by far Tarantino's strong point. He takes a great story and writes an incredible screenplay. The cast is phenomenal fulfilling their roles as tough guys out to do another job. Keitel is the tough talking, heart of gold bad-ass who will help you off the ground and shoot the guy in front of him at the same time. It's as if his conscience takes a break every now and then. Buscemi and Madsen earn respect for their deliveries as Mr. Pink and Mr. Blonde. Roth does is impressive as the rookie and shows his strengths at acting. Even Penn and Tierney deserve credit for their roles as father and son. They might not act like family but put a gun in one of their faces, the other will be at your throat. All together this a magnificent ensemble.Reservoir Dogs will go down in movie history as the gateway to a new generation of film making. Tarantino brings us one of the most unforgettable movies of all time. Thankfully he didn't let this movie go to his head too much and made more great films like Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, and both of the Kill Bill movies.

If the film is successful and looked at as a nice first piece, the director must keep it going and make an even better picture. But the real test is the first picture's appeal to audiences. It can't be dull, boring, and have a bad ending. It has to be great all the way through to the last frame. One director created a whole new type of movie...a Quentin Tarantino film...In Quentin Tarantino's film debut Reservoir Dogs, we follow a group of men who attempt to steal a shipment of diamonds. Joe (Lawrence Tierney), the organizer of the group, has hand selected each of the six men who will perform the robbery. Each is given an alias except for Joe and his son Nice Guy Eddie (Chris Penn) to hide identities in case of someone getting caught and to cover up tracks. There is Mr. White (Harvey Keitel), Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), Mr. Brown (Quentin Tarantino), Mr. Blue (Eddie Bunker), and much to his dismay there is Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi).The job appears to be simple, get in, get out, and get paid. There are eight men total and not a single one of them could ever expected what would happen. After a nice opening in a small diner and what would become the Reservoir Dogs March, we cut to Mr. White and Mr. Orange driving away really fast to the ware house where they would all meet. Mr. Orange has been tagged in the gut and is bleeding quite a bit. Mr. White has given him his real name, Larry, to comfort him. When Mr. Pink arrives shortly after them, he gives his side of the robbery gone wrong. They both agree that there is definitely a snitch in the group. During the heist, the police appeared out of nowhere almost anticipating what would play out. Mr. Blonde in a state of panic\/craziness decided to start shooting innocent people, fearing someone triggered the alarm. When the dust settled, cops were dead, civilians were dead, Mr. Orange was shot, Mr. Brown was shot in the head and believed dead, Mr. Blue was MIA, Mr. Pink and Mr. White are trying to solve everything, and Mr. Blonde has a surprise for them...a cop in a trunk. The movie takes an interesting turn as Mr. Blonde's sanity is in question and the cop is interrogated.Tarantino's unique style shines with his camera angles, music selections, and of course...his dialogue. Tarantino's writing is phenomenal and incredibly brilliant. As soon as the movie starts he thrusts us into the middle of the eight men having a conversation of breakfast. The conversation being Madonna's hit single Like a Virgin. The meaning of the song and how it was derived is brought up. Not your average movie talk, but it's just like real life. The flow and the reactions from everyone make it very real. This is by far Tarantino's strong point. He takes a great story and writes an incredible screenplay. The cast is phenomenal fulfilling their roles as tough guys out to do another job. Keitel is the tough talking, heart of gold bad-ass who will help you off the ground and shoot the guy in front of him at the same time. It's as if his conscience takes a break every now and then. Buscemi and Madsen earn respect for their deliveries as Mr. Pink and Mr. Blonde. Roth does is impressive as the rookie and shows his strengths at acting. Even Penn and Tierney deserve credit for their roles as father and son. They might not act like family but put a gun in one of their faces, the other will be at your throat. All together this a magnificent ensemble.Reservoir Dogs will go down in movie history as the gateway to a new generation of film making. Tarantino brings us one of the most unforgettable movies of all time. Thankfully he didn't let this movie go to his head too much and made more great films like Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, and both of the Kill Bill movies. This movie will quickly become one of your favorites. You will not be disappointed...

Robert Traver, real name John D. Voelker, had been a D.A. in an upper Michigan area populated by ethnic types such as Finns, Poles, etc. he wrote several popular books, Small Town D.A., Laughing Whitefish, and this, his masterpiece. In this famous best seller he envisioned himself as Paul Polly Biegler, a man defeated for a political office and eager to try a sensational case. He is enjoying fishing with his old friend, but when an opportunity comes, he seizes it, after asking some penetrating questions. The case is peculiar because the man accused seems so calm, self-possessed; yet his defense has to be temporary insanity or impulsive loss-of-control. There is some evidence to suggest his wife is promiscuous, and that he, a man with a temper, might have been the one who damaged her before killing her sexual partner rather than the case being a rape. This is an old-style film, meaning highly-competent, movie narrative, complete with discoveries, insights, strong characters, interesting motivations and courtroom pyrotechnics. It is one of three Otto Preminger films that were shockers, by far the most successful. The difference here is the very fine cast. James Stewart was the attorney, Arthur O'Connell his skilled but alcoholic partner and Eve Arden his dynamic secretary. The opposition in the courtroom were Brooks West, Arden's husband in real life, and George C. Scott, in his first major role; the arrested man was Ben Gazzarra, his wife Lee Remick, the judge real-life jurist Joseph N. Welch. Also showing well in this powerful aggregation were Kathryn Grant, Orson Bean, Murray Hamilton, Howard McNear, Ken Lynch, Ross Brown, John Qualen, Irv Kucinet and Joseph Kearns. Technically, this B\/W drama is first-rate all around, I suggest. With a script by Wendell Mayes that follows the novel closely, it boasted cinematography by Sam Leavitt and music borrowed from Duke Ellington who also appeared briefly; Boris Leven designed the stylish production; Howard Leven was the set dresser. The subject matter of the case was explicit for its time; so was the suggestion that Stewart took the case knowing his client was probably guilty and the incident perhaps not a rape at all. The language was unusual for its time; and the case's effect non the local area was magnified because the accused was a serving military officer. it has been suggested lee Remick is played against a pseudo-Christian standard, the one that was applied to Hollywood situations before the 1960s secretly; the rule was any woman that had or invited sexual relations outside of wedlock had to come to a bad end. Here the implication is that if Remick had not had sex with someone other than her husband, she wanted to do so. So the defense is as much of her rights to equal legal liberty with any male as about the truth of her assertion., at least in plot terms. The device of employing a big city type like Scott as Stanley Dancer brought in to oppose Biegler (Stewart) is an interesting one; we have spent time in the small town, so we resent his intrusion along with Stewart. the film is in no way dated; it is about a time when adults were a lot more intelligent, less cynical, and more confident their fellows' abilities to control themselves, male or female. The time of the film, 1959, made it a precedent-setting and very-often-copied sort of movie. it is long at 160 minutes but I suggest never flags and is never less than fascinating.

Upon arrival Willow & a few other dwarfs find Madmartigan (Val Kilmer) stuck in a cage. Madmartigan convinces Willow to give the child to him & he will look after it which he eventually agrees to. They all go their separate ways & that is thought to be that until Willow & Madmartigan meet up again & are forced into a quest to find the great sorceress Fin Raziel (Patricia Hayes) whom has the power to protect the child & help end Queen Bavmorda's evil rule...Directed by Ron Howard I thought Willow was a fairly entertaining fantasy adventure. The script by Bob Dolman based on a story by executive producer George Lucas tries to be another Star Wars (1977) with it's cocky likable hero in Val Kilmer whom is obviously styled after Harrison Ford's Han Solo, an evil & old villain, the usual family conflict with a child who turns good, plenty of child friendly fights & action scenes with rebel armies battling the forces of evil, characters with silly names & an attempt at creating a whole grandiose universe for these characters to live in. The similarities don't stop there either with a romance between the two leads whom at first dislike each other & argue until their true feelings take over & a couple of comic relief characters in two fairies called Rool (Kevin Pollack) & Franjean (Rick Overton) very much in the R2-D2 & C-3PO mould. It all works reasonably well enough & provides decent fun but I found it too long at over 2 hours & I also thought it was a little bit on the slow side. The action scenes feature a lot of slapstick comedy moments which sit at odds with some of the more serious & violent moments, director Howard doesn't create much in the way of pace or excitement but it's all well made & choreographed. There is a cool huge two headed fire breathing monster, some dog creatures & some very fake looking trolls. The special effects are pretty good considering when Willow was made & the technology that was available to the filmmakers with the two headed monster being my favourite effect while some of the optical effects involving the fairies look somewhat dated. With a supposed budget of $35,000,000 Willow is technically a very polished film with some terrific scenery, although it never really convinced me that it was set anywhere other than on Earth with it's snow covered mountain peaks, gravel pits & the unspoilt natural beauty of Welsh & New Zealand forests that these types of fantasy films seem to use as locations. Queen Bavmorda's castle has a nice dark age Gothic feel to it. The acting is OK while stars Kilmer & Whalley went on to marry each other after meeting on this film although they have since divorced. Willow is good solid fantasy adventure that could easily be compared to the recent Lord of the Ring Trilogy (2001 - 2003) in tone & look, I liked it & is perfectly watchable on a Saturday afternoon. Worth a watch.

However it is visually stunning, scored perfectly, and other than his accent, i felt for Pitt's character. The story is about an austrian mountain climber, who becomes friends with the Dai Lai Lama at the time of China's conquest of Tibet. The screenplay is not great, as the film has its boring parts, and does not flow all that well, the direction is decent, but apart from the great cinematography, thanks to Robert Fraisse (The Notebook, Hotel Rwanda), the direction isn't all that good and I thought the film could have been much more interesting, if only the same kind of effort that went into the cinematography, score and pitt's accent(only kidding), went into the direction and screenplay.
