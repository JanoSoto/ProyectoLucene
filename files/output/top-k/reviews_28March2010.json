Why? Because I love this movie, seriously I do. Looking through my 1000 or so reviews here, I couldn't believe I hadn't reviewed this movie; I have seen movies that I have loved and cherished since childhood and I have seen movies that belong at the bottom of the garbage. It's a Wonderful Life belongs to the former, although I am 17, I appreciate a good movie when I see one. This is more than a good movie, it's a timeless masterpiece, that holds up on repeated viewings and never loses its magic.It's a Wonderful Life could have easily been overly-sentimental and clichéd, but the quality of the direction and the screenplay that others have summed up perfectly assured it was a beautiful, heart-warming and somewhat poignant film. While there are some funny parts, not bursting-your-gut funny but funny in a subtle sort of way, other parts are close to heart-rending. The direction from Frank Capra is excellent, sensitive and nuanced, and Capra shows even more talent as a screenwriter having penned one of the most honest and touching scripts ever in a film. Casablanca, All About Eve and The Shawshank Redemption all had wonderful scripts, but the script here has a lot to say about community spirit and shows that this film is much more than feel-good sentimentality. There is the element of feel good here, no doubt about it, but it doesn't overpower what the film intends.Visually, It's a Wonderful Life is a wonder. I don't think it is dated at all, the cinematography is crisp, the black and white looks beautiful and the pristine Christmas scenery really does take me back. Some of my favourite ever memories was of Christmas, whether it was watching nostalgic Christmas videos, eating Christmas dinner or singing carols under the Christmas tree. Another thing I have to mention is that the movie is richly and beautifully scored, Dmitri Tiomkin's music here is absolutely gorgeous, lyrical, whimsical, nostalgic and most importantly it never felt intrusive in the more integral parts of the film. And I have to mention the story, never in my life(and I genuinely mean this) have I seen a movie where it communicates such a strong message and so well too. The story of a suicidal man who is shown the value of his life by his guardian angel is an effective, timeless one, imitated perhaps but never equalled.Finally the acting is wonderful. James Stewart, and I seriously don't give a damn whether he was a racist or not and neither should you, is absolutely superb as George Bailey, a truly complex character who goes through such a lot to get to where he is at the end of the movie. George Bailey is like Mr Deeds, John Doe and Mr Smith rolled into one, and in my opinion only James Stewart could have given justice to a character that has self-doubt gnawed at his essential decency. Also the character change, like that of Alistair Sim's Scrooge at the end of Scrooge, was heart-breakingly believable. Donna Reed is radiant and charming as his wife, who is like a caring lover, devoted wife and dedicated mother, while Thomas Mitchell gives one of his more memorable performances as Uncle Billy. Henry Travers is a revelation as Clarence the guardian angel, but there is another performance I think is worth of mention. For a good morality tale, you need a good villain. Well in the name of Potter, you have one. Who better to portray him than the great Lionel Barrymore acting at the peak of his powers? Overall, a timeless classic with a true and heart-rendingly poignant ending. 10\/10, one of the easiest perfect scores I have made recently.

That makes sense, except when you are watching it sixteen years later on DVD. You do not need that much silence -- it then becomes almost like really watching This Island Earth.Even more mysterious, the film comes in at a short 73 minutes, even shorter than the average episode of 90 minutes. So the movie is shorter than the TV show! And the disc has no special features (besides French language track), so the DVD is not that special -- you would be better off buying a DVD of them watching Manos or something, unless you really enjoyed this particular film.A good film, some funny gags, and a short run time for quick viewing... but really nothing worth making a movie about.

She is so beyond anything I'd ever seen from her that I originally had trouble believing it WAS her in the film.If you can get past some of the more gory scenes, I dare say that all viewers will be well-rewarded in the end. That's not to say you should dismiss the violence. Indeed, it is part-and-parcel to the entire components of the film and its incredibly awesome story structure.And this isn't the first time Brad Pitt and director David Fincher have worked together.

It is a love story, and one with more genuine heart-felt empathy than most, but it also contains a lot of humour, intelligence and depth. Every time I watch the film, I notice new things and spend longer reflecting on some of the issues touched on in the film. Holly comes across superbly as the gorgeous, flirty, outrageous good-time girl who happily accepts money from men on dates, but also manages to portray the complexities of her personality; the vulnerable little-girl-lost who runs away from problems, and wants so desperately to take care of her brother, despite being unable to take care of herself. The acting is so impeccable that it is easy to see why the two leads have fallen for each other, and yet why the obstacles between them still seem so real. There are plenty of smiles along the way, particularly during the scene with the masks, but it is always the love story that keeps you on the edge of your seat, even when you know what's coming next.

The acting is so impeccable that it is easy to see why the two leads have fallen for each other, and yet why the obstacles between them still seem so real.

Robert Loggia is very good, and his Nomination at the Oscars for Best Supporting Actor was justified.

I was completely at a loss of words from the pure style of the film and it was instantly my favorite film.Stanley Kubrick also became instantly my favorite director because his style was so genius. However, I felt it odd that he be my favorite director if I'd only seen one of his films so I hunted down some of his other ones. Then, I saw Dr. Strangelove.The film is a black comedy where a man named General Ripper decides to send off a multitude of air-crafts to bomb Russia and kill them once and for all. These ships are unable to be recalled unless one has a special radio code to call them back with. General Ripper cuts off all communication with his base and throws the U.S. into a nightmare which they desperately try to avoid.The thing that really hits home about this film is that everything that happens during its course is possible, especially during the Cold War, during which the film was fabricated. The entire time you're laughing your ass off, you are suddenly being interrupted by how extremely terrifying the situation is. Nothing could possibly hit home harder.This film is brilliant on so many levels. One of its most notable aspects to me is how it so seamlessly the film blends absolute horror and absolute comedy. In fact, the film was so effective in its dramatic elements that I barely even recognized that it was a comedy at first. I mean, I knew that it was supposed to be a funny film but even today, everything in that film hit right at home and terrified me. When I saw it again, I felt like I was going to explode with delight and laughter. The gags are some of the most memorable of all film and for their time were extremely daring. Although, every time I watch it, there's still something about the pure situation that the story goes through that disturbs me.The gags, as I've said before, are purely brilliant. Perhaps the most brilliant is the running gag of General Ripper (Sterling Hayden) and his obsessive quest to burn down the commies to stop their evil conspiracy to polute our precious bodily fluids. This man is so insane that you can not possibly take him seriously. He is a parody of the standard politician who somehow manages to tie together completely unrelated things and form some kind of disturbed conspiracy, leading to pure idiocy and collapse. In all actuality, he reminds me of Glenn Beck in several ways or at least what Glenn Beck would've been like during the Cold War.Another brilliant gag comes from the president trying to appease the Russian president while explaining to him that they've accidentally sent several ships to destroy their country. Not only that, the Russian president is completely hammered and unable to make reasonable judgments. The entire conversation proceeds like a train wreck from hell and is probably one of the most brilliantly written scenes of all cinema.There are so many incredibly funny moments in this film that I could not possibly list them all and part of what makes this film what it is is Peter Seller's excellent performance, or performances.Peter plays three people in this film; The President of the United States Merkin Muffly, General Ripper's group captain Lionel Mandrake and the hilarious Nazi Scientist Dr. Strangelove, from which the film derives its title. Every single one of his roles are funny for different reason. His president of the united states is just great as a mediator but a completely unsuccessful leader, him as Lionel Mandrake, the nervous officer who understands the complete absurdity of General Ripper but is unable to escape from it due to a lack of will and his memorable Dr. Strangelove is a ridiculous parody of the nazi scientists we paired up with during those times. Without him the film would've just been another comedy.George C. Scott also does a terrific job as a disturbed Military General whose only goal is to cover themselves up so they aren't hated by the entire world (I'm saying only 10-20million killed, tops!). Most every performance in this film is of grade-a quality.Dr. Strangelove is brilliantly written, directed and acted on all levels and is one of the best comedies ever made. It is also an extremely intelligent satire on politics and the several political issues of the time which, to an extent, still mirrors the political issues of today. I highly recommend this film.

One of the key parts of what made the film entertaining was the score. 99 times out of 100 it fitted the scene in question perfectly, and added to the feeling of the moment perfectly. The camera work was actually surprisingly good too, the use of cameras created tension and build up with out the use of massivley expensive special effects. The one particular scene which I feel sums up the film is the amazing showdown scene in the cemetry. The use of music, cameras and the brilliant acting of our three leads.

Even if you've seen the picture before and know what's going to happen, you still think it could turn out differently... That is the brilliance of the film.The bad Whilst there is a lot of good in the film there are a number of things which dampen the film for me. One of which is the lack of details or explanation to a lot of situations which occour. Like one minute the leads are in one place, and the scene changes and they are in a completely different situation several months later with no intervening details.

I'm very fond of so much of his filmography, from the Python series and films, to A Fish Called Wanda to Fierce Creatures and of course, the near perfect Fawlty Towers.Because of this, I was recommended Clockwise.I was expecting a feature-length symphony of chaos and Cleese-humour; Fawlty Towers, but given a budget and a 100 minute run time to wreak havoc for Cleese's character.However, Clockwise is anything but.The biggest problem with the film is its pacing. It is almost unbelievably slow. Of course, a slow buildup is often a benefit in such comedies; the story and circumstances slowly burn towards a riotous explosion of comedy, like Fawlty Towers has so often done. But in those instances, the slowness worked because we were always aware of the threat, of the tension, of the promise of what trouble is bubbling below the surface. In the case of this film however, I was bored almost to the point of turning off the movie.Clockwise features entire scenes where characters do essentially nothing, or engage in so-called 'antics' that are virtually free of tension, suspense or humour. The scenes in the monastery, in the country fields, in the phone box or by the side of the road completely drain the film's energy. The very point of the movie is for us to feel the importance of every second tick by, to race against time, to be terrified of the prospect of being late--of missing the engagement. However, although Cleese's character is set up to be bordering on near obsession with these things, by the midway point he has seemingly abandoned these qualities and drifts through the film, even remarking that he doesn't care anymore. This character trait change is completely unprecedented, and makes no sense, to say nothing of how it drains the film of drama and comedy. I won't even touch on the bizarre and absurd sequence in which Cleese and his student take another man into the woods to steal his clothes by offering sex. It's barely usable in theory, and in execution, the scene is utterly groan-inducing.The second major problem refers to the characters themselves and the way the film handles them. An entire slew of supporting characters are introduced (badly and uninterestingly), each of them supposedly being set up to antagonise and confound Cleese when he finally arrives. After we spend the whole film slowly and numbingly reaching Cleese's engagement, these characters are virtually forgotten, merely wandering into his speech session to distract him for a moment before being seated. The explosion of comedy and awkward confrontation, as was done so marvelously in A Fish Called Wanda, Fierce Creatures and Fawlty Towers, never occurs at all. The film's climax barely even occurs, and when it does, it's merely signposted by Cleese giving a bizarrely disjointed speech; a scene which doesn't seem to know whether it's suggesting that Cleese has lost his mind, or is merely winging it. Frankly, at this point, I didn't care. The subplots and ultimate conclusion of the story are never resolved. The film simply stops. Having Cleese's character no longer caring is fine, but this fact is never properly established.Finally, the performances are either painful or boring. Everyone but Cleese seems to have turned their 'annoying-stereotype' meter up to eleven, screeching, whining and giggling in the most absurd ways. Meanwhile, Cleese himself plays the film surprisingly straight and subdued, barely every reaching his trademark levels of Basil Fawlty hysteria. This, despite the fact that he finds himself in situations that would make Fawlty collapse in agony. Naturally, I understand that we are dealing with different characters here, but since the film which to such arduous lengths in the first act to set up Cleese's neurosis, the fact that he sleepwalks through the rest of the film is genuinely bizarre.Ultimately, Clockwise is incredibly disappointing, and, despite the apparent love of it in certain circles, I feel should be avoided at all costs.It's begging for a remake to inject some tension, suspense and genuine comedy into this simple concept.

Being familiar with Ed Wood's story and having seen the most wonderful biopic Ed Wood (1994) several times, I admire his boldness and his strives for the job he loved; I still admire his never-say-die attitude. He had a love for directing that I wish more people in modern-day Hollywood had.But that doesn't make his movies any more fun to watch. And Glen or Glenda, his first and most confessional film, is probably his very worst.Glen or Glenda is a deadening cult movie about a cross-dresser named Glen (played by director\/writer Ed Wood himself) who despite his love for his fiancée Barbara (Dolores Fuller), cannot seem to conquer his lust for transvestitism, in which he dresses in women's clothing and a wig and thus becomes...Glenda! Glen\/Glenda's story is narrated by a doctor and he too is talked and watched over by a mysterious character called The Scientist played by veteran horror star Bela Lugosi. Oh, and there's also some sub-story about an Alan\/Anne character who becomes a transsexual based on the Christine Jorgenson story, upon whom this movie originally titled I Changed My Sex! was previously to be based.Have I dropped your jaw yet? Well, as much as I want to warn you off this picture if you've never seen it, I would never tell a lie about a movie and there is not one word of falsehood in that plot synopsis I just gave you. Every thing in it is true. This is a movie about cross-dressers and transsexuals, a topic that does not sound very appealing to begin with and is not done in a very appealing manner. I'm sure that with a good screenplay, and a good director (it had neither) that Glen or Glenda, despite the subject matter, could have been a very moving picture. It is a confessional movie on Wood's part, as he was a transvestite in real life as well as on screen. But once again, that does not make it a good movie...or a watchable one for that matter. Glen or Glenda is a jumbled, disorganized mess of a movie that sinks into new trenches in the realm of bad cinema. It makes no more sense than does its notoriously silly scene where Bela Lugosi screams Pull the string! over inexplicable footage of stampeding bison. The majority of the movie is narrated in a monotonous voice, reminding me of some very bad short informative films I've seen before. It's like one of those really bad short films expanded into a seventy-minute feature and twice as dull. We sit there for ages waiting for the plot that never comes. There is no real attempt to even build energy with the camera being locked down in one position for many grueling minutes and long stretches of time where nothing at all happens. The only moments that are worth anybody's time are those of Bela Lugosi who manages to bring some light into these dark trenches. I guess Lugosi is supposed to be like the deity of the film, but personally, I couldn't care less who or what he's supposed to be. I'll tell you what he was A gifted actor who wound up making trash. But he and Wood were very good friends and liked working with each other, so good for him.I will always admire Edward D. Wood Jr. for his passion for the cinema, but I will never as long as I live admire his movies. A film critic once called Ed Wood's movies innocent fun but I think even that is questionable. Innocent?

Wood Jr. He had a passion for his work that I wish more people did have. If we all had the optimism and the commanding hope of Ed Wood, the world would probably be a much better place. Being familiar with Ed Wood's story and having seen the most wonderful biopic Ed Wood (1994) several times, I admire his boldness and his strives for the job he loved; I still admire his never-say-die attitude. He had a love for directing that I wish more people in modern-day Hollywood had.But that doesn't make his movies any more fun to watch. And Glen or Glenda, his first and most confessional film, is probably his very worst.Glen or Glenda is a deadening cult movie about a cross-dresser named Glen (played by director\/writer Ed Wood himself) who despite his love for his fiancée Barbara (Dolores Fuller), cannot seem to conquer his lust for transvestitism, in which he dresses in women's clothing and a wig and thus becomes...Glenda! Glen\/Glenda's story is narrated by a doctor and he too is talked and watched over by a mysterious character called The Scientist played by veteran horror star Bela Lugosi. Oh, and there's also some sub-story about an Alan\/Anne character who becomes a transsexual based on the Christine Jorgenson story, upon whom this movie originally titled I Changed My Sex! was previously to be based.Have I dropped your jaw yet? Well, as much as I want to warn you off this picture if you've never seen it, I would never tell a lie about a movie and there is not one word of falsehood in that plot synopsis I just gave you. Every thing in it is true. This is a movie about cross-dressers and transsexuals, a topic that does not sound very appealing to begin with and is not done in a very appealing manner. I'm sure that with a good screenplay, and a good director (it had neither) that Glen or Glenda, despite the subject matter, could have been a very moving picture. It is a confessional movie on Wood's part, as he was a transvestite in real life as well as on screen. But once again, that does not make it a good movie...or a watchable one for that matter. Glen or Glenda is a jumbled, disorganized mess of a movie that sinks into new trenches in the realm of bad cinema. It makes no more sense than does its notoriously silly scene where Bela Lugosi screams Pull the string! over inexplicable footage of stampeding bison. The majority of the movie is narrated in a monotonous voice, reminding me of some very bad short informative films I've seen before. It's like one of those really bad short films expanded into a seventy-minute feature and twice as dull. We sit there for ages waiting for the plot that never comes. There is no real attempt to even build energy with the camera being locked down in one position for many grueling minutes and long stretches of time where nothing at all happens. The only moments that are worth anybody's time are those of Bela Lugosi who manages to bring some light into these dark trenches. I guess Lugosi is supposed to be like the deity of the film, but personally, I couldn't care less who or what he's supposed to be. I'll tell you what he was A gifted actor who wound up making trash. But he and Wood were very good friends and liked working with each other, so good for him.I will always admire Edward D. Wood Jr. for his passion for the cinema, but I will never as long as I live admire his movies. A film critic once called Ed Wood's movies innocent fun but I think even that is questionable. Innocent? Yes. Fun? No, sir. And if Citizen Kane is the Mount Everest of the cinematic world, then Glen or Glenda is probably the Mariana Trench.

I used to hang out at the clubs, parks, Greyhound Station and cemetery during my overnight layovers when I was a Train Attendant on Amtrak's Palmetto from Washington, DC to Savannah in the late 80's and early 90's. There was an active male prostitute and drug business in the beautiful squares after dark. Drunk college students weaved in and out of the downtown clubs and gangs of horny black gay guys were always cruising about, so I couldn't wait to taste the flava of the week. The best bar-b-q and fried fish was sold at a greasy spoon near the Howard Johnson Lodge where the train crew stayed...and the naughty projects were close by. I was devastated when our contract hotel was moved out of the city. Many of the scenes in this movie are familiar, but there should have been more - like SCAD and the old Central of Georgia train station which hosted the legendary Nancy Hanks streamliner Miss Charlotte rode to and from Atlanta. Savannah - like Charleston and New Orleans - is a true Southern Belle.Kevin Spacey looks and acts like his real life gay character, Jim Williams...and his eyes light up like a Christmas tree whenever John Cusack appears. Is Spacey merely in character or is he simply overcome by Cusack's boyish beauty? Cusack is no great actor but he possesses a cute baby face and a matinée idol appeal that celebrity worshipers and co-stars adore. His naive appeal obviously turns Lady Chablis on and they make a perfectly odd couple. It makes you wonder what happened after they left the black débutante ball - arm in arm headed to her place for a drink.
