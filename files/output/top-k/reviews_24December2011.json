[{"date":"24 December 2011","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Hunter Doherty Patch Adams, M.D. is an American physician, social activist, citizen diplomat and author. He founded the Gesundheit! Institute in 1971. Each year he organizes a group of volunteers from around the world to travel to various countries where they dress as clowns in an effort to bring humor to orphans, patients, and other people.His life inspired the film entitled,Patch Adams.It is a comedy- drama film that stars Robin Williams together with Daniel London,Philip Seymour Hoffman,Monica Potter and Bob Gunton.It was directed by Tom Shadyac and it was based on the life story of Dr. Hunter Patch Adams and the book Gesundheit Good Health is a Laughing Matter,written by Adams himself together with Maureen Mylander.Patch Adams is a troubled young man who commits himself to a mental institution in the late 1960s. His experiences there convince Adams to become a doctor, and he enrolls in medical school, where he is appalled at the cold, clinical professionalism that alienates patients from their caregivers. Determined to provide emotional and spiritual relief as well as medicine, Adams clowns around for his patients, getting to know them personally. Although his efforts seem to work wonders and the hospital nursing staff is grateful for the levity Adams provides, his methods alienate his uptight roommate Mitch as well as the staff and faculty of his school. Adams perseveres, however, even starting his own low-cost rural clinic called the Gesundheit Institute, and wooing a pretty fellow student, Carin. Tragedy strikes, and Adams' career is put in jeopardy, forcing him to defend his style and philosophy before a board of jurists determined to bar him from practicing medicine.This is a true story film that presents a Virginia medical student who breaks all the rules by daring to proclaim that the best medicine for patients is love, laughter and play. Although it was based on a real story,the movie itself looks less plausible and unlikely realistic considering the different way Dr. Adams treats his patients and practices medicine. Although the viewer may find it somewhat far from reality,the viewer must make it a point to realize that one must not view this as a documentary but a comedy-drama that presents the acting talent and brilliant performance of Robin Williams. That alone makes the film worth watching and let alone forget the story's predictability and formulaic devices that were applied into the plot. Only Williams raises this film above average with his excellent portrayal of Adams.
