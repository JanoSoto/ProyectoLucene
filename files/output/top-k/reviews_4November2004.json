Despite the highly-publicised fact that Captain Kirk was gonna bite the dust in this one, I had high hopes, recalling how the death of Spock was handled in The Wrath of Khan. Not to mention, with the TNG series finale', All Good Things..., being soooooooo good, a TNG big-screen outing that combines the casts of both series HAS to be even MORE spectacular!!!However, what we were treated to was a murky, discombobulated outing that essentially wasted the talents & screen presences of Jimmy Doohan, Walter Koenig, Jonathan Frakes, Mirina Sirtis, Gates McFadden & Michael Dorn. The scenes that featured William Shatner, Patrick Stewart, Brent Spiner, LeVar Burton, & Malcolm McDowell were spotty at best, though Patrick Stewart was given ample time to emote.The three cast members of TOS (Shatner, Doohan, & Koenig) all did fine jobs (as always!) with what they had to work with, but it's obvious that the roles the latter two wound up with were written for Leonard Nimoy & DeForest Kelley. Chekov as a medic & Scotty as a science officer? Not that they couldn't do it in a pinch, but the dialogue could've at least been re-written to suit the characters. However, it speaks volumes that Nimoy & Kelley turned down the parts once they'd read the script.The lighting on this film is one of the most frustrating aspects of watching it, from a technical standpoint. Everything appears in ambient lighting, which is something that was rarely done on either TOS or TNG. When Will Riker walks out of Picard's ready room, he walks onto the bridge in almost pitch blackness. HUH?!Also, what's with each crew member changing uniforms every time they come back from an away mission? START with the new uniforms & let it stand at that!The biggest complaint I have about this movie is the fact that co-writer Brannon Braga admitted from the get-go that he was not a classic Trek fan & had always wanted to kill off Captain Kirk if the two casts ever met on screen. As I stated earlier, the death of Spock in Trek II was handled tastefully &, as Kirk stated in his eulogy, his sacrifice (was not) a vain or empty one. Spock's death actually SERVED a purpose. Braga simply wanted to kill Kirk, & it shows in the lack of depth with which it was handled. Classic Trek fan or not, if it hadn't been for Shatner & Co., Braga wouldn't have enjoyed the lucrative coattail-riding career he's had for almost 20 years. He needs to be a lot more respectful of his elders.The shoddy plotpoints that lead up to Kirk's first death in the 23rd century are hackneyed & poorly written. For Starfleet to assign a young, bumbling officer as the captain of their flagship is not only ludicrous, but also ill-conceived. I guess he was trying to make some type of political statement about the military as a large, unthinking collective, but he wound up insulting a, if you'll pardon the bad pun, generation of fans who grew up watching a Star Trek series where Starfleet was adept at assigning officers who could handle crises without looking over their shoulder or having to call home every time. I know this was designed to make Kirk look good & still vital despite his retirement, but it only served to make Starfleet & their newly-chosen crew look like nothing more than a bunch of buffoons & publicity hounds.The attempts at trying to tie in loose ends from TNG (Lursa & B'Etor) was a hindrance that could've been done without. They had no logical place in this movie; it was a contrivance that Dr Soran just so happened to contact two Klingon sisters (or maybe they contacted him -- who knows, who cares?) who had it in for Picard & could help him with his plight if he helped them with theirs.The emotion chip scenes with Data, while being far better utilised in ensuing TNG films, were forced, & I don't know if Brent Spiner is to blame for that or the writers. TNG always had a healthy dose of humour in it, but throughout the film, I kept waiting to hear a muted trumpet blaring waa-waa-WAAAAAAA! after every one of Data's lines once he'd installed the emotion chip. And the one word of profanity spoken in the movie was spoken by Spiner in a lame attempt by the writers to garner cheap laughs from an already insulted audience.Bringing in Guinan as a bridge to explain what the Nexus was & what it did was overkill. While it's generally a welcome thing to see Guinan, her scenes were a bit too pat & explanatory (not to mention they were forcibly reiterated when Picard finally confronted Dr Soran face-to-face) & again, a character's presence was wasted by being reduced to, what Ridley Scott termed, Irving The Explainer. Let's have a little mystery here folks! Who's this madman destroying stars? Why's he doing it? Guinan, care to espouse for me? Thank you! As I said, a bit too pat & FAR too pandering a mentality for a Trek film.Another thing (& this has always irritated me about TNG) that really bothered me about the whole Picard-going-to-rescue-Kirk-from-the-Nexus-&-save-the-universe-one-last-time nonsense is that Picard has always been portrayed as a little bit TOO perfect. Kirk, like any other human being, made occasional mistakes, & his foibles made him all the more identifiable with the audience. Not so with Picard; he was always depicted as right, regardless of the situation. Granted, here, Picard had foreknowledge of the Nexus & how it affected those within it while Kirk didn't, but to suggest that Picard would be less susceptible to the wiles of the Nexus than Kirk is ridiculous. Braga really goes out of his way to say MY captain's better than YOUR captain! with this one.(BTW -- I know Ron Moore co-wrote this script with Braga, but the points I bring up are the ones where Braga had his hands in a bit too heavily.)And, finally, we have the death of Kirk.Spock died saving the Enterprise from the obsessions of a madman. Kirk died saving a solar system from the obsessions of a madman.The difference? How it was handled.Spock's death was poignant to the point of tears. The only reason Kirk's death caused tears is because it was so senseless. Whether it's the original ending where Kirk, after saving the solar system, is shot in the back by Dr Soran, or the theatrical ending where Kirk, after saving the solar system, FALLS OFF A BRIDGE (!!), the death is pointless. Hey, Jean-Luc... look! I've saved the universe one last time, like we agreed. Now I'm gonna go off & die somewhere.Puh-LEASE!!Kirk doesn't even get a decent burial for cryin' out loud! At least Gary Mitchell gave Kirk a tombstone!! Picard dumps his body under a pile of rocks & places his battered Starfleet insignia atop it, then calls his ship to pick him up. How friggin' TOUCHING.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Mystery"},{"date":"4 November 2004","score":"11 out of 20 people found the following review useful","review":" SpoilersThe challenge in making The Bridges of Madison County is to convince the audience that spending four days together out of their entire lives, a man and a woman can be so deeply in love that they, separately, wanted their cremated ashes to be spread over the bridge where they first met.Over the 135 minutes of this movie (which by the way never felt too long to this viewer) director Client Eastwood goes about this formidable task. (I have not read the book so these comments are confined solely to the movie). It's a normal, contended if not outrageously happy family, with nearly-grown-up kids, and a cordial if a little stagnant marriage, when Francesca (Meryl Streep) faces the prospect of spending four days by herself in the farm house when the family goes to a country fair. In comes globe-trotting loner National Geographic photographer Robert (Clint Eastwood), a little lost in search of a covered bridge he is hoping to shoot. In a way, there is a little similarity to Before Sunrise, in that two complete strangers in a chance meeting suddenly click, realizing how much they enjoy each other's company and conversation, and carry on to develop a deep relationship within a very limited time. Obviously, there is a big difference, that would put TBOMC more in the category of Interlude (1968) (which, by the way, I consider to be the best in the 'brief encounter' genre). But somehow, I tend to associate it more with Before Sunrise.Upon showing Robert the bridge, Francesca is actually a little bit annoyed that right away, this man become so absorbed with it that he seems to have forgotten about her. Streep portrayed that feeling beautifully, particularly in the tone of her voice, when she says something to the effect of 'I can wait, I have time', more to herself than to Robert. But then, annoyance becomes attraction, as we recall the general belief (albeit somewhat male-centered) that to a woman, a man is most attractive when he is fully absorbed in his work. The relationship develops in a wonderfully relaxed pace, with dropping her off home, 'care to come in for a coffee?', 'would you like to stay for dinner?'&#133;&#133;..all nice and friendly until Robert asks one question too many, although quite innocently, 'ever thought of leaving your husband?' Even with profuse apologies, the parting was a little shadowed.Calming down, Francesca reflects that she might have reacted too strongly, drives to the bridge in darkness and leaves a note to invite Robert back to dinner the following day. After seeing the note, Robert calls to accept the invitation, but asks Francesca to join him at the bridge at twilight as he wants to do some work there first. They then separately carry on with the day, Francesca going to buy a new dress for the occasion while Robert goes about with his business. But then, at lunch, he witnesses how a woman known to be having an affair is received in the restaurant (this is one of those small communities where everybody knows what everybody else is doing). Concerned that being seen with him might compromise Francesca, he calls her to give her the opportunity to back out. She seems unperturbed, they meet at the bridge, nothing untoward happens. As Robert continues to handle their relationship in a most considerate and gentlemanly manner, Francesca's attraction to him deepens. We see how she is erotically aroused as she baths in the tub where Robert has just showered, and finally puts on her alluring new dress and comes down to the kitchen, looking like an entirely different person from the earthy country housewife she has been. The spark that sets the whole thing on fire is a call from a neighbour, simply to ask how she has been managing with the family away. As the phone is on the wall right behind where Robert is sitting, Francesca's hand comes gently down to rest on Robert's shoulder as she speaks, and he responds by putting his hand over hers. The rest is history, so to speak. They spend their third day together, a day very much reminiscent of 'interlude'. Cold reality hits on the morning of the fourth and last day and Francesca is that close to running away with Robert. We have seen how Francesca is attracted to Robert, first by his dedication and talents, then by his gentlemanly consideration and kindness. What is less convincing is the feelings on Robert's part. Indeed, Francesca has asked the same question, that since Roberts has readily admitted that he has close women friends in various cities, what makes Francesca in Madison County any different? To be fair, Eastwood's acting has contributed much towards making Robert's feelings towards Francesca convincing.

(I have not read the book so these comments are confined solely to the movie).

Even with profuse apologies, the parting was a little shadowed.Calming down, Francesca reflects that she might have reacted too strongly, drives to the bridge in darkness and leaves a note to invite Robert back to dinner the following day. After seeing the note, Robert calls to accept the invitation, but asks Francesca to join him at the bridge at twilight as he wants to do some work there first. They then separately carry on with the day, Francesca going to buy a new dress for the occasion while Robert goes about with his business. But then, at lunch, he witnesses how a woman known to be having an affair is received in the restaurant (this is one of those small communities where everybody knows what everybody else is doing). Concerned that being seen with him might compromise Francesca, he calls her to give her the opportunity to back out. She seems unperturbed, they meet at the bridge, nothing untoward happens. As Robert continues to handle their relationship in a most considerate and gentlemanly manner, Francesca's attraction to him deepens. We see how she is erotically aroused as she baths in the tub where Robert has just showered, and finally puts on her alluring new dress and comes down to the kitchen, looking like an entirely different person from the earthy country housewife she has been. The spark that sets the whole thing on fire is a call from a neighbour, simply to ask how she has been managing with the family away. As the phone is on the wall right behind where Robert is sitting, Francesca's hand comes gently down to rest on Robert's shoulder as she speaks, and he responds by putting his hand over hers. The rest is history, so to speak. They spend their third day together, a day very much reminiscent of 'interlude'.

Criticising it for that is simply ludicrous; if you don't like films of this nature, don't watch it is my advice. That being said...the film follows Tom Welles (Nicholas Cage), a private detective that is hired to hunt down the origins of a snuff film found by an old widow amongst her husband's things. More importantly than that, the old lady wants Welles to find out if the girl is still alive...however, while conducting his investigation, Welles is drawn into a world of things barely legal and his investigation develops into an obsession...8mm tries to be two things; an intriguing mystery and a heartbreaking drama, but it doesn't lampoon either one effectively enough to be classed as either. The mystery side of the story, while very good, is far too short, and it seems that Welles gets to the bottom of the mystery without too much effort. The mystery also hangs too much on Joaquin Phoenix's character; a street smart...ahem, pervert, that knows everything. If it wasn't for him, Welles would most likely have been sat at home twiddling his thumbs wondering why he hasn't got any leads; and this doesn't inspire a great confidence in our hero from the audience. That being said, the mystery still moves well and the underground world of snuff film-making is very intriguing. The drama stems from the girl in the video's mother and Welles' resulting lust for revenge. This actually works a lot better than I thought it would; but it still doesn't really make you feel anything for any of the characters. In the final third, the movie turns into a revenge thriller and it somewhat loses it's way, but it's still more than exciting enough and there are scenes towards the end that are very powerful.As I said, the world portrayed in this film is intriguing. It's a journey into the unknown for the audience (at least I hope it is!), and the way that it is shown in this film is excellent.

The director; Joel Schumacher has proved himself to be something of a one hit wonder after the magnificent 'The Lost Boys', but this film is more than enough to prove otherwise; his direction is superb, it's moody when it needs to be, it's exciting when it needs to be and it's morbid when it needs to be. The acting all round is good, with Cage gaining all the major plaudits. Cage should make more films of this nature; he has a sleazy look about him that could be utilized. Not to mention the fact that he's very cool...Overall, 8mm isn't a great film and it most certainly could have been a lot better. If you want a film about snuff films, I would recommend 'Tesis' over this one, but if you want another after watching Tesis; 8mm is the place to be. Not a great film, but well worth watching.

Before you want to make me suffer because of my blasphemy, I want you to listen to what I have to say. After you've read it you can still quarter me and burn my remains as much as you like. Hahahahahaha.I never judge before I've seen a movie with my own eyes. It's too easy to say that you love or hate something, just because everybody else says it is great or awful, without actually seeing it. When I watch a movie I always start with 7\/10 as the final score. Is it a very good movie, my rating will go up, is it a bad one, my rating will fall. Very fair I would think, no?Well, I saw The Fellowship of The Ring and it certainly had some great scenes, but overall I wasn't convinced by it. Don't you think that the story line (the battle between good and evil) is a little bit too thin? I know it is very popular since 9\/11 and everybody needs his heroes, but this kind of thinking is just too black and white. Look at the battle scenes the bad guys (I don't remember all their names, but that doesn't matter) attack with hundreds, even thousands, yet our 9 dear friends know to kill them all without suffering too much losses themselves (at the end of the movie only two were killed). Doesn't anybody ask himself questions than? I think they would have been killed by the first attack, end of the movie, now let's go home!Second reason why I didn't really like the movie Often I was thinking But what are they actually talking about???? Too often I got to hear so many weird names of places and people, making it impossible to stay focused. I'm not saying they had to be called John and Bill on their way to Washington and New York, but names like 'Idoknowhereiamrightnowbutijustdontwanttotellyouia' certainly don't help. Third reason why I think this wasn't the best movie I've ever seen the duration of the movie. I don't mind watching a movie for three, four hours, but at least it has to have a good pace. The first 1.5 to 2 hours were so slow, I sometimes had the feeling I would fall asleep. If I were the editor of this movie, I would have cut it in half. Thirty minutes to get to know the different characters and the reason why they start their journey, another hour for the journey itself. There would still be plenty of time to show all the beautiful landscapes, the many battles with the different evil creatures,...And yet, I have some good critics too. I have to admit that, even though the story isn't much too my taste, the movie had some nice features as well. For example I loved those 9 ghosts on their black horses. I really think they looked cool. Same for the special effects. The demon the magician had to fight just before his death, or the water in the form of horses that flooded the 9 horsemen were absolutely astonishing and great to watch. But as I said at the start of this review, it just isn't enough to save the movie. As a conclusion I want to say that the real heroes in this movie were the magnificent landscapes, the marvelous special effects, but that they can't save the lack of a good story and characters I can identify myself with. But I'm in a generous mood today and I give this movie a 6\/10. Now come up with your matches and lighters...

The first 1.5 to 2 hours were so slow, I sometimes had the feeling I would fall asleep. If I were the editor of this movie, I would have cut it in half. Thirty minutes to get to know the different characters and the reason why they start their journey, another hour for the journey itself. There would still be plenty of time to show all the beautiful landscapes, the many battles with the different evil creatures,...And yet, I have some good critics too. I have to admit that, even though the story isn't much too my taste, the movie had some nice features as well. For example I loved those 9 ghosts on their black horses. I really think they looked cool. Same for the special effects. The demon the magician had to fight just before his death, or the water in the form of horses that flooded the 9 horsemen were absolutely astonishing and great to watch. But as I said at the start of this review, it just isn't enough to save the movie. As a conclusion I want to say that the real heroes in this movie were the magnificent landscapes, the marvelous special effects, but that they can't save the lack of a good story and characters I can identify myself with. But I'm in a generous mood today and I give this movie a 6\/10. Now come up with your matches and lighters...

I mean, visually it is OK, but any other movie that would rely so much on nothing else but its special effects would just be crushed by all the critics. Before you want to make me suffer because of my blasphemy, I want you to listen to what I have to say. After you've read it you can still quarter me and burn my remains as much as you like. Hahahahahaha.I never judge before I've seen a movie with my own eyes. It's too easy to say that you love or hate something, just because everybody else says it is great or awful, without actually seeing it. When I watch a movie I always start with 7\/10 as the final score. Is it a very good movie, my rating will go up, is it a bad one, my rating will fall. Very fair I would think, no?Well, I saw The Fellowship of The Ring and it certainly had some great scenes, but overall I wasn't convinced by it. Don't you think that the story line (the battle between good and evil) is a little bit too thin? I know it is very popular since 9\/11 and everybody needs his heroes, but this kind of thinking is just too black and white. Look at the battle scenes the bad guys (I don't remember all their names, but that doesn't matter) attack with hundreds, even thousands, yet our 9 dear friends know to kill them all without suffering too much losses themselves (at the end of the movie only two were killed). Doesn't anybody ask himself questions than? I think they would have been killed by the first attack, end of the movie, now let's go home!Second reason why I didn't really like the movie Often I was thinking But what are they actually talking about???? Too often I got to hear so many weird names of places and people, making it impossible to stay focused. I'm not saying they had to be called John and Bill on their way to Washington and New York, but names like 'Idoknowhereiamrightnowbutijustdontwanttotellyouia' certainly don't help.

The 1997 version, directed by Adrian Lyne, certainly has it's merits, and is headed by two very good leads in Irons and Swain. But it is this, Stanley Kubrick's adaptation, that I prefer overall. Kubrick said in an interview after the film's release, Had I known what I would've had to cut out, I probably wouldn't of made the film. It's a surprising irony though that what had to be suppressed or changed from the book works to his advantage. Like other works under the master's belt, this has some comedy that is so dark that you almost (or do) feel guilty after laughing. The innuendo, even decades later, is still as provocative. And when it gets disturbing, it doesn't go too far over the line. I have not read the book, but I have heard much about it, what was different, and I think Kubrick at least is most successful at infusing his trademark touches to the material.For starters, there is the acting. Like with for example Full Metal Jacket, the supporting actors somehow outrank the leads. This is not to say that James Mason (Humbert Humbert) and Sue Lyon (Dolores Lolita Hayes) are not highly believable in their parts. But in looking at Peter Sellers in his multiple roles via the curious, insanely oddball Quilty, and Shelley Winters as Lolita's mother, they are simply flat-out brilliant (I would choose a better word if I could, believe me). Right from the first scene, which happens to take the last scene of the story in place, Sellers doesn't have me for a second thinking that he isn't perfectly off-the-wall. As was in Dr. Strangelove, his contributions to the project are incalculable. Winters, on the other hand, finds that balance with Mrs. Hayes as a lonely middle-aged woman looking for companionship, though unable to shake her over-protective tendencies.As for Mason and Lyon, their scenes together are at the least a little overtly melodramatic (which might have been the idea, it may take another few viewings to really grasp the weight of their performances) and at best helps define what the film is about. Mason finds the right notes, if a little anxiously and stuffy at times, in how Humbert is almost like a kid trying to break out of his middle-aged professor image. When he meets Lolita he's awestruck, and falls for her hard, very hard, which sets up what happens to the two of them for the rest of the film. What is even more interesting is how the dynamic is placed with Lolita, who is wiser in ways Humbert is not, and how the sort of idea of mutual youth is tempting, but definitely not everlasting. As the film unfolds it's third act, the film becomes an intense kind of morality tale, where male insecurities are touched upon with Humbert, and even Quilty to a degree. Kubrick, being one of the finest of dramatic character psychologists, hardly skips a beat in making sure not to lose the strange bits (which must be some of the better bits in Nabokov's text) with humor.Then there is the most rewarding thing of all in a Kubrick film, which is seeing how he photographs the scenes and characters. It holds some of the moves and angles and lighting he's held to for all of his career (some shots show as a precursor to Eyes Wide Shut perhaps), and how the camera stays on the characters in many scenes (actually, almost all the scenes) adds that right tension and space between us and them. If anything else, just watch the film for the sake of watching a film moving and staying put and capturing faces in particular ways. Lolita, in the end, may not be one of my very favorite Kubrick films (though only time and repeat viewings will tell), but it's certainly worth a viewing. Some Kubrick fans may come to this after seeing the essentials like 2001, the Shining, or Clockwork Orange, however it could come as being a favorite in some circles. It certainly is, for my money, as enticing and intriguing a sexual satire I've seen in many a moon.

Kubrick, being one of the finest of dramatic character psychologists, hardly skips a beat in making sure not to lose the strange bits (which must be some of the better bits in Nabokov's text) with humor.Then there is the most rewarding thing of all in a Kubrick film, which is seeing how he photographs the scenes and characters. It holds some of the moves and angles and lighting he's held to for all of his career (some shots show as a precursor to Eyes Wide Shut perhaps), and how the camera stays on the characters in many scenes (actually, almost all the scenes) adds that right tension and space between us and them. If anything else, just watch the film for the sake of watching a film moving and staying put and capturing faces in particular ways. Lolita, in the end, may not be one of my very favorite Kubrick films (though only time and repeat viewings will tell), but it's certainly worth a viewing. Some Kubrick fans may come to this after seeing the essentials like 2001, the Shining, or Clockwork Orange, however it could come as being a favorite in some circles. It certainly is, for my money, as enticing and intriguing a sexual satire I've seen in many a moon.

As a compilation film, Atomic Café has resulted in a totally new film that is much richer and more meaningful than the sum of its parts.Atomic Café, will be more understandable if we are familiar with the roots of its historical material. As a history film, Atomic Café takes us to experience three levels of time. The first is the internal time, the Cold War, communism versus the free world, when propaganda about the atomic bomb was made to persuade the people that only nuclear weapons would protect them from the Evil Empire. The period of the'Nuclear Free' movement comes next. And thirdly, the present time, when the world is changed but has to face the same irony that still is just as relevant today, the fear of weapons of mass destruction.In the beginning, the film appears to be a straightforward history of America's development and use of atomic weapons. Historical footage is used to add credibility to the information presented. The power of the bomb is demonstrated by showing dramatic footage of the Trinity test; interviews with Bikini Islanders, and preserved eyewitness congressional testimony of atomic bomb veterans. The impact of the weapon is documented through footage of the bomb victims. The intention is not to make us become objective about certain issues, rather it 'is designed to make us question the nature of the information presented' (Freeman Reading Packet, 108).The film uses unique techniques. It is like a collage that 'sacrifices the conventions of continuity editing and the sense of a very specific location in time and place that follows from it to explore associations and patterns that involve temporal rhythms and spatial juxtaposition' (Nichols, 102). It is all about editing raw material and splicing segments? of military training films, civil defense films, archive footage, interviews, newsreel material, and fifties music. Many sequences are edited to show the most ridiculous side of the duck-and-cover drills and how naïve the Americans were at that time. To make it more derisive the film shows how the military training films were so amateurishly acted and misleading, such as the scene about the beauty of the H-bomb. I believe that the filmmakers have made their point in choosing all the footage for the film. Perhaps the intention is to challenge and deprive the intended message of the original footage.If we take a look in more detail, Atomic Café chooses and juxtaposes its various elements to support its point-of-view. One of the examples is the continual references to radio receivers. Perhaps it is a symbol that is used to invoke the idea of the power of mass media. The intention is 'to sensitize us to the danger of uncritical media consumption' (Freeman Reading Packet, 110). It is so ironic to see how people in the '50s could be so passive that they believed in every single thing that they heard about the atom bomb on the radio. We can see from the footage how people became so afraid and escaped to their shelter after hearing that a bomb was launched. Perhaps fear had taken such control of these people that the more frightened they were, the more they were easily persuaded.I guess it would be a great mistake to ignore the political message that is contained in the film. Maybe for some viewers this is just a gimmick about the Cold War and things that happens during the '50's.

The films portrayal of Elvis' birthplace of Memphis, possibly one of the most featureless, gritty and desolate representations of urban America ever committed to film, is a deceptively clever and substantial take on American subcultures.Without doubt, it is the first of the films three vignettes that makes the film stand out a little more than Jarmusch's other quirky offerings.

It's quite impressive that 15 years after its release, Jarmusch's depiction of alternative culture manages to capture the pretentious but proudly on-the-edges attitudes probably more apparent in today's retro-obsessed climate than ever before.Jarmusch's signature eclectic cast is another reason for repeated viewing, the subtleties of, in particular, Steve Buscemi's stuttering and nervous performance, are worth looking out for. As is the linking theme of Elvis' ghost in all three vignettes, a brilliant example of how to take a simple theme, and continually parodize its implications until its every mention leads to some sort of in-joke.

Not everyone has the opportunity to recognize, especially when one lives it, what is really important, what is in fact real; the truth of who we are and who others are. And to recognize that before the others and ourselves. Not everyone has that opportunity. Almost all of us fall in the lies and fictions of who we are, who the others are and the place of all of us in our world, but only few of us - lucky few - manage, in the end, but maybe still in time, to see the truth, the reality. And these ones, may consider themselves very happy.All it takes is to understand that, and we can be who we want to our own selves.If you like '80s teen comedies, this one is not to be missed. I liked this movie and i just wanted to share these thoughts i had after seeing it. Patrick Dempsey is good in it, and Amanda Peterson is absolutely great, loved her. Wish i had met a girl like her when i was in high school. But then again, maybe i did...7\/10 overall, a good movie.

Those new to the X-Men will probably not appreciate it as much. But all in all, Bryan Singer did a great job. It couldn't have been easy to adapt 40+ years of character and environment development into 104 minutes. But Singer rose to the challenge. People who don't read comic books don't understand that it is so much more than childish amusement. My English teacher referred to it as all spectacle and no depth. Flash, boom, crash But if that were true, any comic book would do. However, the various X-Men books have held on to spots in the top ten sellers for many years. This is because they speak to the human condition. Sure it's exaggerated, but that's how they get their point across. Any good story is first and foremost about people and how they deal with their situation. Movie, book, comic; sci-fi, drama, action. They are merely the vehicle by which the human condition is explored and no one genre is inferior to the other. Only the storyteller is inferior. X-Men is about family through friendship, loyalty, betrayal, being an outcast and finding your place, death, overcoming, sorrow, happiness, anger, bitterness, love, and how our experiences shape us. It is about human beings. When Bryan Singer set out to make the movie, he might have changed some superficial things (I was not a fan a Halle Barry's Storm), but he kept the core the same. And that is what makes this a great movie and adaptation. Too truly enjoy this movie, look not to the action (which is great) or the special effects (which are superb), they are only window dressing. Look to the interaction between the characters. Listen to the words they say. Watch their emotions. They are human, and humans can relate to them.
