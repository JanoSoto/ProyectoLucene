When I heard about the movie URBAN LEGEND I was scared that the stories, were not going to live up to their true nature, on film. Well, after the excellent opening scene, my worst nightmare had come true. URBAN LEGEND was a disorganized, unappealing, and not-at-all scary, bad movie. The major flaw in Urban Legend, is that it ventures far from the reality that the original stories had created in their own way. For example; what was the killer thinking, wearing a heavy parka in a very warm environment? Especially in a heated swimming pool arena. Or what about the improbability that a person can fall many floors from a window, land on solid ground, but still manage to get back up and go for the kill again? Also, what made the stories scary, was very simple. The actual danger was not realized until after the fact. It was at that point when the characters realize how close they were to the danger. In URBAN LEGEND it is too late for the characters to even realize that they are in danger, before they are killed off! The acting was uneven, the storyline was another SCREAM copycat, and the murders were nothing to really remember. The legends about this film are true- it's  horrible!!!

However, the way it was handled was original and that's why I loved it.  The dialogue is a huge factor in it.  Kevin Williamson is one of the best screenwriters in Hollywood now and his self-referential lines are classics. I love when the characters talk about famous people and movies we have all seen.  It makes the characters more realistic and like people we know.  My favorite line was the references of Neve Campbell and Jennifer Love Hewitt.Robert Rodriguez makes another great flick after From Dusk Till Dawn.  His camera angles are amazing and I love how his characters in his movies shoot guns.  The score added to the effect of the action on the screen.  My favorite character in the film was the one played by Clea DuVall.  Her character was smart, brave and tough.  She reminds me of one of my best friends and i love her for those very same characteristics.  Clea DuVall gives the best delivery of a line in the movie No... f***ing... way! Elijah Wood, I think, is one of the best young actors of our generation and has been great since i first saw him in Radio Flyer and The Good Son.One of the creepiest things in the movie was the teacher played by Piper Laurie.  She looks EXACTLY like my drama teacher from high school.  It was so creepy.  My and my best friend went crazy about that for days.  I'm not sure if it was intentional or not, but, what is up with Josh Harnett's hair? It was messed-up in Halloween H20 also.  Is it a fashion statement?  Was his hairdresser just never available for him?Rapper Usher Raymond served no purpose in the film, except to draw in a few little girls and call Elijah Wood an anal probe.  Anyone could have played that part and it would have the same impact.  I'm not saying Usher is a bad actor, he just had an underwritten role and played it so stereotypically. The special effects were awesome, although, they were obviously special effects.  The pool scene at the end was awesome.I had a lot of fun watching this film.  Yes, it is predictable and it isn't entirely original, but it was fun.  And, the overall thing I loved about this film is that it doesn't leave it open for a sequel.  That really ticks me off.  If this film is successful enough to the point where the makers wanna make a sequel, that's fine.  But don't leave the ending open for one. There has been too many bad movies for that lately.  Kevin and Robert, keep up the good work!  You two are the bomb! ","genre":null},{"date":"2 January 1999","score":"","review":"  This movie was fun.  It wasn't original and that was its downfall.

I had made up my mine that Wes Craven was a very over-rated horror director, producing more 'bombs' than 'five-stars'.

Horror movies must be more than just blood and gore to make it scary, you need the human emotion. If you can't feel or relate to a character, who cares if they die? In SCREAM 2, you do feel for and relate to the characters and are horrifed (hopefully- or problems may be setting in!) when they get killed off. Unlike the opening scene of the first SCREAM, nothing in this movie was as disturbing, which made it more entertaining. There are many scenes in SCREAM 2 which are bound to become classic and imitated time and time again. The camera angles are well done, the acting is definitely convincing, and the music is tense.

This movie proved it.In fact everyone from this fine gentleman and little Kulani were all in fine form. I also enjoyed the fact that the young man in the story came from the inner city and his grandmother helped raise him so he was polite and caring. The role of Alfre found herself because of the love of her family not a man. The only problem with the movie was the presence of Nathan (sloppy symbolism) and the heavy-handed ending.

Armageddon was one long, continuous, unbelievable scene.  In the opener, a meteor falls from the sky, scoring a direct hit on a large Polynesian man, causing an explosion powerful enough to heave cars into the air, but miraculously leaving unscathed the 10-pound, so-ugly-he's-cute dog with which he'd just been fighting, as well as its owner.  From that scene, I knew my eyes were in for a painful oh, you gotta be kidding me rolling experience.  And I never did get past the fact that I was asked to believe that NASA could put together a mission to simultaneously send *two* space shuttles out past the moon to blow up an asteroid the size of Texas with one nuclear warhead (okay...they sent two, but only one was expected to be needed and, in the end, actually used) with only 18 days to work with, from the first moment they even realized they had a problem, to the end of the mission.  Come on...these are the guys who need a couple of years of planning to send one shuttle into earth orbit!  That's why we have four shuttles... so they can be rehearsing three, while one is actually putting on the show.Maybe I would've enjoyed the movie more if it hadn't been so predictable. But, not once in the entire movie did anything surprise me...from the deaths of the peripheral characters, to the time-worn use of countdowns reaching their final seconds before success is achieved.  My God, they even had a which wire should I cut to defuse the bomb? scene!  I thought we put that to rest in the Lethal Weapon series.  This is supposed to create suspense? The group I was with formed a quick pool to guess what the timer would reach when they finally shut the detonator down (what do you think?...less than a second left?  2.4 seconds?  more than 5???).  But was there ever any doubt that they'd defuse it?  No...not really.And I'm not even going to go into the physically-impossible special effects. I'll leave that to the people who went home after the movie and worked out the actual gee-forces that would be involved in the slingshot maneuver around the moon.  I'll just say to any director out there...please...just once in a science-fiction movie, don't let a space ship swoop and dive around asteroids, like some high-tech Piper Cub.  Space shuttles have wings so they can land, once they return to Earth...other than that, they have no use, because there is no air in space!Okay...mama always told me, if you don't have something nice to say, don't say anything.  So, on the plus side for Armageddon was Steve Buscemi's comic relief.  He actually looked like some schmuck who was pulled off the street and asked wanna go up into outer space? and had the time of his life doing it.  Liv Tyler was cute as the lone female voice in the Boys' Club.  I'm more impressed with her acting every time I see her in a new movie.  I hope she gets a shot at some truly dramatic roles someday soon, to see what she can do with them.  Bruce Willis played the same character he's played in every other successful movie he's ever done, and he does it well.  But, other than those, the other characters were derivative and predictable.I just didn't see what all the fuss was about.  They could've done this as a remake of John Wayne's Hellfighters, saved about a gazillion dollars on useless special effects, and *really* turned a profit.  Or...maybe Hellfighters In Space was what they were going for in the first place.  If so, they tried a little too hard. ","genre":null},{"date":"2 January 1999","score":"","review":"  Well, they say that when you watch\/read science-fiction, you have to leave your disbelief at the door...but this was ridiculous.  Armageddon was one long, continuous, unbelievable scene.  In the opener, a meteor falls from the sky, scoring a direct hit on a large Polynesian man, causing an explosion powerful enough to heave cars into the air, but miraculously leaving unscathed the 10-pound, so-ugly-he's-cute dog with which he'd just been fighting, as well as its owner.  From that scene, I knew my eyes were in for a painful oh, you gotta be kidding me rolling experience.  And I never did get past the fact that I was asked to believe that NASA could put together a mission to simultaneously send *two* space shuttles out past the moon to blow up an asteroid the size of Texas with one nuclear warhead (okay...they sent two, but only one was expected to be needed and, in the end, actually used) with only 18 days to work with, from the first moment they even realized they had a problem, to the end of the mission.  Come on...these are the guys who need a couple of years of planning to send one shuttle into earth orbit!  That's why we have four shuttles... so they can be rehearsing three, while one is actually putting on the show.Maybe I would've enjoyed the movie more if it hadn't been so predictable. But, not once in the entire movie did anything surprise me...from the deaths of the peripheral characters, to the time-worn use of countdowns reaching their final seconds before success is achieved.  My God, they even had a which wire should I cut to defuse the bomb? scene!  I thought we put that to rest in the Lethal Weapon series.  This is supposed to create suspense? The group I was with formed a quick pool to guess what the timer would reach when they finally shut the detonator down (what do you think?...less than a second left?  2.4 seconds?  more than 5???).  But was there ever any doubt that they'd defuse it?  No...not really.And I'm not even going to go into the physically-impossible special effects.
