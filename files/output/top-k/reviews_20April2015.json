Superficially set in the gang haunts, streets, bistros, apartments, pawnshops and eateries in the cheesiest corners of modern Los Angeles, this dizzily convoluted noir plunges us into a kind of retro-nightmare fantasy land (formed of Tarantino's own pop-drenched experience) that keeps looping back on itself and traps us in a cul- de-sac of double-crosses, absurdity, arousal and danger, never completely sure of where anyone's going or why &#x96; creating a sheer directionless excitement that only Tarantino can conjure. The structure itself is wickedly ingenious Three interconnected stories, bracketed by several preludes and a few codas, are told deliberately out of sequence, with the same cast - a bloody band of outsiders - popping up everywhere. Most of the characters are familiar - the boxer who refuses to throw a fight (Bruce Willis), an obsessive war veteran (Christopher Walken), a mob boss's jaded wife (Uma Thurman), two desperate young lovers starting a crime spree (Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer), a pair of single-minded hit men who operate within a twisted code of honor (John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson) - but Tarantino's approach to their behavior consistently avoids the stereotypical. By and large these mugs exist in a moral vacuum which, for Tarantino, is the ideal atmosphere for cracking jokes while cracking open heads. Their tales all start slowly, but soon everyone's destiny plays out as the stories dovetail into outlandish twists. Stuff happens in Pulp Fiction, exhilarating, jaw-dropping, visceral stuff but Tarantino weaves the stock stories into an amazingly coherent whole. Unlike other action-thrillers, this movie gets its charge not from action pyrotechnics but from its electric barrage of language, wisecracks and dialog, as the lingo takes on a murderous eloquence - a verbal swagger. The tension Tarantino creates between the threat of guns and the greater threat of verbal fusillade is electrifying. It's hard to imagine any viewer leaving this extravagantly demented low- life lollapalooza without carrying away at least a few indelible moments. The entire cast, like Tarantino, also seems to revel in sloshing around in this muck, each one of them having a time of their lives.Pulp Fiction also makes it clear, despite its gory content, that Tarantino isn't just some punk nihilist on a sick joyride; his movies are all about consequences. There is a moral core in Pulp Fiction too- a subversive one. But ultimately this is also what makes the movie so unexpectedly buoyant. Despite the drugs, the blood, the language and the grit, Pulp Fiction is fundamentally light-hearted. It's fluff!

I heard so much about it and with Sci-Fi being one of my favorite genres I was genuinely excited.The film started with a overture and I didn't mind. But then it goes to establishing shots of a desert. They were good but it lasted for minutes. I didn't understand why they needed so much of these shots. Did they film a lot and couldn't decide which one was best so they just put them all in? I sure hope not. From there on we get early humans evolving to find their first tool. While I think it could have been cut down it was a good sequence. Then we go into space and when our protagonist is on his shuttle it is a very cool few minutes with stunning visuals and outstanding music. From then on he gets his assignment to go to Jupiter after contact was lost with the ship they had recently sent out. When our hero gets on the ship he bonds with HAL 9000 which is a good moment in the film. Later when a fellow astronaut goes outside the ship to fix something it gets boring. While he is fixing it we get a dearth baser like breathing for the whole time. An that happens when anyone is in space. When he gets back on the ship the two astronauts slowly start to realize HAL is plotting something. They plan to shut him down. This is a part I will not spoil seeing a it is one of my favorite sequences ever. It show the two astronauts trying to stop HAL and while I wouldn't recommend the whole movie I definitely advice watching this wonderful set of scenes. From then on our protagonist enters a rectangular shaped object, which I later found out was a Monolith, whatever that means. He enters the Monolith and we get a disorienting and confusing ending\/climax. He enters the Monolith and it looks like Star Wars hyperspace on drugs.

A little before my time, but that doesn't stop me from loving such comedies, especially when John Hughes is in charge. Weird Science is another geeky invention of the 80's and I just love how over-the-top the film is and how the film knows it. Any film that turns militaristic brothers into ugly monsters or a beautiful woman freezing grandparents gets a check plus in my book. The film isn't the best teen film from the decades, but it's sure one of the most cheesiest and entertaining ones. John Hughes's film is about two unpopular, bullied kids named Wyatt and Gary who are trying to find true love. They decide to generate a woman through the use of Wyatt's computer. But after Lisa is created, the situation they created vastly spirals out of control. The film has a plethora of enjoyable performances. Anthony Michael Hall and Ilan Mitchell-Smith certainly made there characters relatable, awkward, and funny. I liked Kelly LeBrock's sexy performance as Lisa. Robert Downey Jr was pretty good as one of the bullies, almost Tony Stark-like. Bill Paxton was highly enjoyable as the older brother super involved with the military lifestyle. Overall, Weird Science is an over-the-top movie but in a fascinating, enduring way. It's essentially a product of the 80's, a great decade for movies. The film may be weird and quite funny, but it does have relevant thematic issues that every kid should take a note of.

Of course Lean made other films, like Dickens adaptations, but this is so very intimate, mostly about two characters (maybe two other ones are supporting, but that's it) and the relationship they have, an emotional affair that never really, far as we can see, develop into sex. But Lean was at his best when he made his epics intimate, when it was just about two characters in a room or a place trying to figure things out - those are the scenes that made Kwai and Lawrence so compelling, was taking the high stakes of human beings amid the large vistas. Here, the locations are set in gloomy old England, immediately post-war, and is simply about two adults - Celia Johnson as Laura and Trevor Howard as Alex - who know they've made a connection, and know they have to move on. How can they? One of those tremendously dramatic scenes in films, the kind that one may take for granted, happens not too soon after the film begins. We see the couple together about to separate - for good, it seems - as the sort of End at the beginning style of non-linear storytelling. At a café one of Laura's friends, played by Everly Gregg, comes in and won't.. stop.. talking. A stream of words, perfectly friendly, but without any shred of a sense of what's going on in front of her unless it's spelled out. The two women get on the train after the couple separates, and she continues to talk. Laura narrates, but it's more about the immediate thoughts in her head, as Lean cuts between close-ups of Gregg's non-stop mouth, and Johnson's face, sullen, distant, and her thoughts shift between I wish you were dead. No, that is wrong, I didn't mean that. But I wish you would stop talking. It's one of those moments that made me sit up and take notice. Brief Encounter isn't about to make these characters, just because they're in their 30's (verging on 40's) with marriages and kids, not have thoughts and feelings that drift into how people think and feel. But so much of what this film is about is repression, how one must stuff real feelings underneath for responsibility. Of course, Laura loves her kids and, to a large extent even, her husband, who also talks and talks, though isn't as unpleasant to listen to as the chatterbox Dolly. But she still has thoughts - more narration, but the kind that is a rarity in intelligent movies, that reveals about character instead of spelling things out - and we feel for her even as she is doing something wrong in the eyes of many.The theme of Brief Encounter is universal, love that cannot be, going back to Shakespeare. But somehow this story spoke more to me - maybe as I'm an adult and not a teenager anymore - than, say, Romeo & Juliet. Laura and Alec, and as played by these two magnificent actors, mostly due to their restraint, but also in how warm and kind and generous they are as actors for their characters, are people who become so raw and moving that they become embedded in the audience's consciousness long after it's all over. There's also a nice contrast with a working class couple, who we see from time to time at the café the middle class couple regularly meets at. It's interesting to see how their relationship develops in contrast to the main couple (perhaps obviously so, the only nitpick about the movie). But it makes Coward's play richer too; not all hope is lost for everyone, and, as usual, life goes on - until it doesn't.This is a small triumph about love in the face of all odds, and how mature people deal with it. Few tales of infidelity have ever been this rich, and though it may be aped by others it's hard to come close to its purity. And amid the ultimate sadness, there are still many moments of happiness between this couple. Hell, we even get a scene where they go to a Donald Duck cartoon! Perhaps today it might not work as well due to modern audiences expecting more passion, more sex. That might be fine for today. For 1945, its sense of showing love develop like this is never less than touching, and it holds up due to its sharp dialog, class distinctions, and the richness of Johnson's character and performance (Howard, too, is quite good, though is in a way kind of a supporting character too despite the length of screen time it's Laura's story, ultimately).

However, there is something that most probably have never even considered. If you look at all the elements that make up this film, it could be considered the best of a number of genres. It could be considered the best noir film, the best thriller, and even the best war film ever. And I'll tell you right now that it sure as hell is the best romance ever put on screen. Casablanca has it all and it never gets old. The plot is timeless. Humphrey Bogart plays Rick Blaine, a self-proclaimed drunkard and American living in Africa during World War II after being forced out of Paris by Nazi oppression. He's a mysterious fugitive, and he runs a bar and gambling joint as a loner. One day, a woman named Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) walks in with the famous Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid). The scene that follows between Rick, Ilsa, and Rick's piano player Sam (Dooley Wilson), is perfect. Rick is shocked to see her and emotion flows from the scene from all three characters. These emotions include surprise, fear, and anger. As we learn the backstory, a romance between Rick and Ilsa in Paris, we become closer to each character. Not just Rick and Ilsa, but Victor too. We are caught in a love triangle for the ages. Both men love Ilsa and Ilsa loves both men. Should she stay in Casablanca with Rick or should she go to America with Victor? Should Rick give Victor the transfer papers he is hiding from the Germans or keep them for himself? These are the questions that appear and it is thrilling to see them answered. The biggest strength of the film is the plot, driven by an excellent screenplay. There's a reason this film contains five or six of the most famous quotes in film history. We never get tired of hearing Bogart say Heres looking at you, kid. Speaking of Bogart, he and Bergman give tremendous performances as the star-crossed lovers and they are supported by some wonderful supporting performances, especially that of Claude Rains as Captain Renault. The film is shot beautifully. Other than Citizen Kane, it is probably the best display of black-and-white in the history of American cinema. Nothing is particularly spectacular or special about it, but it is done so flawlessly. Casablanca is deservedly heralded as an ultimate classic because it does so much near- perfectly.

Based on the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Phillip K Dick, this was director Ridley Scott's second sci-fi film after Alien (1979). It's set in L.A. of 2019, which is now a polluted dystopia full of huge overbearing billboards and enormous skyscraper blocks that resemble Mayan temples. The heavy clouds and constant rain ensure that all events play out in a constant darkness. In this future there are advanced androids called replicants, which are used for dangerous activities such as off-world colonisations. A rogue group of these machines rebel and return to earth with deadly intent. A detective who specialises in assassinating them - a blade runner - is given the task of seeking and 'retiring' them.The specific combination of a world in permanent darkness and a detective storyline featuring a world-weary policeman results in perhaps the ultimate example of tech-noir, which is a combination of science fiction with the feel of traditional film noir mysteries. The very original production design used to construct this future world is probably the single most notable feature of the film and is what defines it. Both the cityscapes and the retro-styled interiors are very well conceived and delivered. The script and acting are both good too with Harrison Ford perfectly cast in the lead role and Rutger Hauer never better as the lead android; we also have a very memorable turn from Daryl Hannah as a pleasure model replicant. Rounding things off is a famous synth score from Vangelis; unfortunately, the film only features the brilliant main theme in the final credits.There have been three different cuts of the movie over the years. I saw the original one several years ago and have recently seen the 'Final Cut' (I never saw the 'Director's Cut'). There are quite a lot of amendments in this last version but the main one that people remember mostly is the ending in which an earlier unicorn dream and origami model are used subtly to suggest that the protagonist is a replicant himself. The ending is certainly darker than the original one but not without hope, after all the message of the film is an ironic one in that it is suggested that it is only the replicants who experience true living in this world. Human drudgery on earth is nothing compared to what these androids experience in their shorter lifespan. So when Ford's character exits at the end knowing his true nature, he realises that he may in actual fact be the fortunate one.

For those of you who do not know he wrote (Lawrence of Arabia, Doctor Zhivago, and A Man For All Seasons) three movies I have seen at least three times each. The film consisted of an all-star cast Robert De Niro, Jeremy Irons, Ray McAnally, and Ronald Pickup. There were upcoming actors people who be familiar with, but May not know Liam Neeson was in this and Aiden Quinn was in this. The cast is made up of the finest actors and extras any film crew could ask for to make a film of this magnitude. People reading this review should be familiar with a brilliant conductor, orchestrator, and composer by the name of Ennio Morricone who wrote the Oscar- Nominated worthy musical score of The Mission (1986). Morricone opened my eyes to the world of such beauty. As other readers, year after year, read this review and think what the heck was he blabbering about I may tune into one of his pieces and find myself in a trance unable to wake for a few minutes to a several minutes when listening to his composed scores. Ennio Morricone like all great composers can assemble a classical score that allows the audience to have a connection with the music. Each piece he has composed was specific for the movie he did, but every music score he has ever composed is symbolic. It represents how the audience can lose themselves in their thoughts and minds for a few minutes to a few hours. You may know some of his other works such as; The Man with No Name Trilogy (Dollars Trilogy), Once Upon a Time in the West (1968), Cinema Paradiso (1988), and The Untouchables (1987). All of which got some recognition, but he has composed hundreds of other musical pieces that are considered masterpieces. When he dies he will be remembered always. If you ever heard one of Morricone's musical scores at least one of his musical scores would move your heart, your mind, and your body. It is not possible to not be moved when you listen to the beauty in his music he created. If you are not moved by any of his music you are either deaf or do not have an interest in music. The film revolved around the events of the Treaty of Madrid 1750; in which at the time Portugal and Spain were the so called Superpowers of the known world. Great Britain would become the Superpower shortly, but they would lag behind these two countries for now waiting their turn. Portugal and Spain were discovering new lands and colonizing these lands they discovered such as the continent of South America. Both countries wanted a part of South America so they happened to draw an imaginary line across the continent and determined who would control what boundaries. As history suggests to us countries will try to exploit anything possible to gain control of land and its resources for wealth, influence, and power. It seems the Spanish saw the tribes in their boundaries, the Guarani Indians, as potential converts to Christianity, while Portuguese saw the inhabitants as nothing more than animals, only appearing to look like a human in flesh. Portuguese wanted to use these Indians as slaves for slave labor when the Treaty of Madrid occurred; Spain ceding part of Jesuit Paraguay. Between what each country's government wanted and the Catholic Church the region was unstable for years. The film is about the work the Jesuit Priests are trying to accomplish in South America before and after the Treaty of Madrid was signed by Spain and Portugal in 1750. The Jesuit Priests unlike certain people tried to learn the inhabitants' culture and language before they tried to convert them to Christianity and set up missionaries. The Portuguese did no such thing to learn their culture as they felt they were inhuman and they could not be taught. I will not bore you with any more details as other reviewers have told you plenty about Robert De Niro's character Rodrigo Mendoza (a slave trader), Jeremy Irons character Father Gabriel (Jesuit Priest). Ray McAnally's character Cardinal Altamirano who must decide what missions will remain under the Church's protection and must be done away. He is sent by the Vatican to decide such matters. The film is full of moral social commentary, as it shows what happens when an unsuspecting\/unwilling people are conquered. Did the Guarani Indians really want to be converted to Christianity? Are we to think a peaceful, remote colony of Guarani Indians left on their own for thousands of years really wanted to become westernized or found? Who are we to judge what culture is more superior? The Mission forces us to think about topics as well. What would you do if we were part of the Guarani Indians whose culture was taken from us? What would we take with us? Everyone has their own answers to these questions. The film is a timeless classic, but some people will see it not. If everyone who has a good heart or a functioning brain they will realize this film is not bad. The director of the film said this, The first two movies I made The Killing Fields (1984) and The Mission (1986), I loved making, but in some ways they've been an albatross round one's neck. Everybody thinks that's what you're supposed to be doing. These two movies were huge projects unlike his small projects thereafter.

Unfortunately, trouble seems to follow him.Or...Plot line Bored, directionless Charles Oakley (Joseph Cotton) &#x96; a jobless, thirty-something, single man, with a lot of money &#x96; is being stalked by men who look like gumshoes. After expertly giving them the slip, Oakley decides it's best to hide out with his sister's family in the sleepy, wonderous town of Santa Rosa, CA &#x96; where he is known as Uncle Charlie. Unfortunately, his favorite niece and namesake, the fawning Young Charlie Newton, is becoming too inquisitive...In this collaboration between Alfred Hitchcock and Thornton Wilder plot lines don't do this film justice. There is a richness of detail in the characterizations and the dialogue that still holds more than seventy years after the making of the film. In truth, Hitchcock would never be able to achieve the communal feel that he masterfully captured in this film, and Wilder would never be able to weave the tension or menace that kept this film going all the way to the end in any of his works.This was the second Hitchcock film I had seen as a child &#x96; the first being 1934's The Man Who Knew Too Much. I remembered thinking that this filmmaker must concentrate on family films &#x96; dark, family films, though.It is not an average Hitchcock film. There are no monuments to climb such as Big Ben. Nor are there any ships to wreck. If you're a Hitchcock fan, you'll also miss the gunplay and extended chase sequences. Young Charlie is not a cool, icy blonde. She is a raven head, young adult who speaks her feelings plainly. And Uncle Charlie? He is Hitchcock's first (Norman Bates being the second) anti-hero. He also speaks his feelings plainly. But boy can these Charlies keep secrets! The Charlies are the set pieces in this Hitchcock film. Joseph Valentine photographed them in bookend poses, in order to emphasis the closeness...UNNATURAL closeness...between the two. Instead of guns, there is a lot of power play between these self made twins, flipping who is in control and who's not.IMO Young Charlie is arguably Hitchcock's best Heroine. She has many emotional hurdles to overcome, and she does it without fueling anyone's suspicions that something is amiss. Her aim to protect her family is one many of the viewing audience can understand.Of the suspense master's heroines, Lisa Fremont was the most head strong. Melanie Daniels was the most sympathetic. Jill Lawrence and Frances Stevens were the most able, either through wealth or skill or both. The Second Mrs. de Winter (the only heroine without a first name) had to grow the most on screen &#x96; literally from a nobody to a formidable mistress. And Iris Henderson was the smartest &#x96; by far. But none of them had to survive the trails that Young Charlie had to. And Young Charlie had to change greatly also, in the end becoming an Ice-Cold Heroine.I believe that the only three heroines who give Young Charlie any competition were the two spies, Eve Kindell and Alicia Huberman; and Carol Fisher. Carol Fisher was the most knowledgeable of the heroines; Eve was more steely, and Alicia faced far more dangers. But Young Charlie wasn't cajoled into taking action, like the spies were. Her moral compass was instantly set to Family once she figured out what was going down. (Note how she is not taken for a fool once she is put under interrogation. She sets the terms.) And more importantly, Carol, Eve and Alicia were provided for by established institutions and very capable Hitchcock heroes. (Cary Grant played the knight in shining armor in both spy cases; Joel McCrea's John Jones provided the metal for Carol.) Young Charlie didn't have that luxury. In a great performance by Wright, Charlie's wits were all she had to keep her alive.She needed it. For all though there is much debate as to who is the best Hitchcock heroine, there is very little over who is the best antagonist. That honor goes to Joseph Cotton's creepy Uncle Charlie. Prequels are needed for this character. This layered, hard to pin down, portrayal of the bad guy (?) was what Hitchcock had wanted for Johnnie, Cary Grant's role in Suspicion. But the studio balked at their matinée idol playing a cold-blooded killing villain; so, Johnnie's ending was re-shot to show that he was Mr. Okay.No such road blocks stood in Joseph Cotton's way. As it was, he was able to craft one of the most memorable characters in film history. Why the studios favored Grant over Cotton, idk. Maybe they had high hopes for the end film. (It got an Oscar nomination for Best Story.) (Strangely enough, the only heroine who garnered attention from the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences was the weakest, Johnnie's wife, Lina - the only heroine without a last name - as played by Joan Fontaine.)P.S.Young Charlie gets involved with the silliest love story Alfred Hitchcock ever directed. In a documentary on the film, Theresa Wright said that his wife, co-screenwriter Alma Reville, Patricia Collinge, who played Emma Newton, and Wright, herself, backed Hitchcock off of exploring the relationship any further, due to Young Charlie's age and the tribulations that the character was suffering. As it is filmed, it becomes another trial for Young Charlie having to deal with a love sick fool. Collinge rewrote the scene to distance the love interest.

Carol Fisher was the most knowledgeable of the heroines; Eve was more steely, and Alicia faced far more dangers. But Young Charlie wasn't cajoled into taking action, like the spies were. Her moral compass was instantly set to Family once she figured out what was going down. (Note how she is not taken for a fool once she is put under interrogation. She sets the terms.) And more importantly, Carol, Eve and Alicia were provided for by established institutions and very capable Hitchcock heroes. (Cary Grant played the knight in shining armor in both spy cases; Joel McCrea's John Jones provided the metal for Carol.) Young Charlie didn't have that luxury. In a great performance by Wright, Charlie's wits were all she had to keep her alive.She needed it. For all though there is much debate as to who is the best Hitchcock heroine, there is very little over who is the best antagonist. That honor goes to Joseph Cotton's creepy Uncle Charlie. Prequels are needed for this character. This layered, hard to pin down, portrayal of the bad guy (?) was what Hitchcock had wanted for Johnnie, Cary Grant's role in Suspicion. But the studio balked at their matinée idol playing a cold-blooded killing villain; so, Johnnie's ending was re-shot to show that he was Mr. Okay.No such road blocks stood in Joseph Cotton's way. As it was, he was able to craft one of the most memorable characters in film history. Why the studios favored Grant over Cotton, idk. Maybe they had high hopes for the end film. (It got an Oscar nomination for Best Story.) (Strangely enough, the only heroine who garnered attention from the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences was the weakest, Johnnie's wife, Lina - the only heroine without a last name - as played by Joan Fontaine.)P.S.Young Charlie gets involved with the silliest love story Alfred Hitchcock ever directed. In a documentary on the film, Theresa Wright said that his wife, co-screenwriter Alma Reville, Patricia Collinge, who played Emma Newton, and Wright, herself, backed Hitchcock off of exploring the relationship any further, due to Young Charlie's age and the tribulations that the character was suffering. As it is filmed, it becomes another trial for Young Charlie having to deal with a love sick fool. Collinge rewrote the scene to distance the love interest.

Maybe this is just too dated for me now or I remembered it differently but the version I saw recently was a special edition with extra footage and in high definition and I couldn't be any more unimpressed. A deranged psycho and mass murderer manages to escape from an asylum by killing a member of staff and makes his way towards a actors studio. That right there is the first plot hole with this, if this guy is so deranged and psychotic, why would he only be serviced by one unarmed, wafer thin orderly and be able to make his way out before the alarm is raised? Several actors who are putting on a stage play about a mass murderer are required to stay late and work on various scenes and they are not able to leave until the director is satisfied. So at the directors request, the studio is locked up and the key is hidden. The recently escaped psycho manages to get locked in with them.From then on it's just a stock standard stalk and slash fare where the killer has typically anticipated every move and manages to be in every place the victims are, even though he's never been there before and is deranged. He never makes a mistake, a whole group of people never manage to gain the upper hand and the local police are all bungling idiots. I'm cringing watching these people stumble from one stupid death scene to the next. In savage irony one of the first who gets killed is also the one who was responsible for hiding the key. Despite all the gory death scenes I was simply bored to death in this. Plus it takes far too long for it to get going. With all of the bickering and bitching going on whilst on and off the set, I'm actually wishing for all these academy award hopefuls to die horribly, so when they do, it's no great loss.There are a few moments in this of genuine tension but they just didn't redeem the movie enough to drag this into a realm of interest.I guess for fans of eighties horror this would be a must see and a must own but for someone with just idle curiosity, borrow it or rent it only.

Indeed he made many movies and of which many are imprinted in the popular. But with so many movies of course there are one or two movies that are easily forgotten including this movie Rope. It's a no holds barred movie that will leave you breathless throughout the viewing experience.Right at the beginning, it already tells you that is a story of two men who had committed a murder for the sake of proving it is an 'art', the perfect crime. The story's thrill is not whodunnit but the thrill comes from the question will the killers be caught and if so how? That is the ultimate question. The actors John Dall as Brandon and Farley Granger as Philip played excellently as two partners in crime with the former being a psychotic superior who revels in trying to search for applause and the latter being submissive. Brandon thinks that only superior individuals are the ones that can commit murder and thus it's a privilege to the select few. The two actors performances were superb in expressing what kind of relationship both has and it is obvious that there is homosexual connotation in this relationship. Having said this, it appears that Alfred Hitchcock is fascinated in the dark recesses of the human psyche and it felt that this movie is a precursor to Psycho. James Stewart plays as the protagonist who had suspected that something is up and he played really well in this role. Without spoiling too much, Stewart appears to be the viewer in the screen as he tries to discover the truth.It's not the performance that I truly enjoyed but the technical aspect of the movie is the one that I truly marvel. Hitchcock was a pure genius in making every shot counts and making subtleties in shooting the movie in seamless continuous shot (it was technically impossible at the time so there were cuts but the camera goes behind a person to 'fade away'). The continuous shot is what made this movie impeccable because there was no break given to the viewers which for me left me literally breathless until the end of the movie and hanging by a thread. This technical trump card was enhanced by the excellent dialogue that are both compelling and thought-provoking to present the theme of morality and logic and Nietzschean philosophy. The themes were enhanced by the setting, lighting and props that complemented each other to create a suspenseful mood.Overall I love this movie because of the subtleties to express the theme of morality of murder raised in this movie which was in turn questions raised from the real life trial of Leopold and Loeb (from which Brandon and Philip characters were based upon). Indeed while Rope is not sophisticated and heavy on philosophy, the dialogue and subtleties in lighting, acting and props wave these themes for audiences to consider. These things are what made me admire Hitchcock even more but most of all the genius use of continuous tracking shot to leave the audience breathless was an absolute genius. I couldn't even emphasize this more. Rope is indeed an underrated gem in all Alfred Hitchcock filmography and filmmakers could learn many valuable things from the movie from lighting to props, dialogue and shooting. I praise Hitchcock.

This movie is just boring all throughout. Also,i felt it was too scary for children. It made my little cousins cry. The songs were bad in my opinion. I hated every character, and i really didn't care what happened to them, really i just wanted this movie to end! Disney is capable of so much more, which I saw in 2015 Cinderella! That Beats out this any day of the week. There just wasn't anything for me in this movie, very bland and boring. I really don't know what else to say about it, it was bland and poor!

This is gross and stupid. I am some one who as seen all the movies they are making fun. I liked most of them. They did not insult these movie. They probably like these movies. It is not so bad to make fun of horror movies if you are being funny. But they were not being funny they were just being sick and stupid. Even the bad horror movie they made fun of they did not point out how stupid they were they had stupid collage hummer. The bad horror movies there make fun of are better movies. This movie is pooh. Don't believe me There is scene were James Woods is taking a pooh. And just proves my point. Don't see this movie it is not funny it just pooh.
