This scene doesn't create dramatic tension, but does induce nausea.Sigourney Weaver is a gun  opponent, and allegedly only agreed to do Alien3 if the producers would eliminate the use of guns in the film to make an anti-gun statement.

It is never explained how she got implanted with the larvae, but this is one of too many story holes to count.In the final scene, to prevent the bad guys from getting the queen larva she is infested with, Ripley leaps into a convenient pit of molten lava to sacrifice herself for the sake of humanity, just as the queen larva bursts from her chest, in slow motion.

Jennifer Jason Leigh is terrific as typical high school girl who thinks having sex is a rite of passage into acceptance, and Ray Walston is upstaged by none as the no-nonsense teacher.  The movie has many funny moments, with a few degrading and depressing moments thrown in out of left field that spoil the fun and have you reflecting on how depressing the good ol' days were long after the fun starts again.  Worst case  Jennifer Jason Leigh loses her virginity to the school creep in a very depressing tunnel (he couldn't even spring for a hotel), we are given a very gratuitous closeup of her breasts as she looks at the dreary, dripping ceiling, and later she discovers she's pregnant and has an abortion.  When her brother, Judge Reinholt, finds out, she says Please don't tell mom and dad.  He is shocked, not that she had an abortion, but that she would even think he would tell. Are you kidding?  Come on!  He replies.  What a bro'. Why squeal on your fifteen-year-old sister to your parents that she had an illegal abortion?  They might do something silly like get her birth control and counseling on sex (not to mention a physical examination that could save her life.)  Adults are seen peripherally with an us against them attitude, and the movie doesn't even seem conscious of it.  The alienation from adults and depressing mistakes kids can make dampens the overall enjoyment of the film, which frankly could have done without it.  Why even include these scenes?  If you're going to have a raunchy film, show the breasts and get on with it, and if you want a message, why show a scene where it's shown as *good* to hide the abortions from the parents?  It almost feels like a message started to bubble up at one point and was beaten down again before it could emerge.It could also have done without the how to perform a b****** on a carrot scene in the cafeteria, while cheering guys look on.  The producers of this film were in their 50's I believe when this film was made.  Do they really believe our youth had degenerated to this level or close to it by the 80's? Or did they think they were too obtuse to be insulted by it?  More rhetorically, did they care?  Needless exploitation scenes like this really detract from the film, and could have been easily edited out with no loss of continuity.If you see the movie, you will probably have a lot of fun; but I think you too will notice these moments like five-feet speed bumps on the open highway.Happiness is good health and a poor memory.

Well, this is another one, which came out in the tail-end of the '80s, and is blessed to have snagged a good director in Albert Pyun and some guy name Van Damme.The movie's plot is essentially this post-apocalyptic world; plagues killing folks; maurauders; hero; scientist needs to get from point a to b with info on plague cure; maurauders do bad things; hero kicks their ass. You get the hint.Onto the movie itself. First, a few pointsThis is a decent action movie. I recommend watching it with the sound all the way down. There are some truly inspired action scenes, such as the one where Van Damme lures his pursuers into sewer pipes, then waits for one of the thugs while perched high in an alcove. Very inspired and well done. In fact, many of the action scenes in this movie is very well done.But, as usual, acting is not Van Damme's strong suit. Look, the guy just overacts, okay? It's what you'd expect from a muscle-bound man -- high over-compensation factor. He can't act, so he overacts. He's a short guy, so he over-pumps himself up. You get the drill. The rest of the cast aren't all that great, either. All b-actors who have since vanished off the face of the Earth.But, as mentioned before, for all its faults this movie does have its moments. And these can usually be found -- and ONLY found -- in the action scenes. The running fight between Van Damme and the bad guy's crew in the plains is pretty good stuff.

Well, this is another one, which came out in the tail-end of the '80s, and is blessed to have snagged a good director in Albert Pyun and some guy name Van Damme.The movie's plot is essentially this post-apocalyptic world; plagues killing folks; maurauders; hero; scientist needs to get from point a to b with info on plague cure; maurauders do bad things; hero kicks their ass. You get the hint.Onto the movie itself. First, a few pointsThis is a decent action movie. I recommend watching it with the sound all the way down. There are some truly inspired action scenes, such as the one where Van Damme lures his pursuers into sewer pipes, then waits for one of the thugs while perched high in an alcove. Very inspired and well done. In fact, many of the action scenes in this movie is very well done.But, as usual, acting is not Van Damme's strong suit. Look, the guy just overacts, okay? It's what you'd expect from a muscle-bound man -- high over-compensation factor. He can't act, so he overacts. He's a short guy, so he over-pumps himself up. You get the drill. The rest of the cast aren't all that great, either. All b-actors who have since vanished off the face of the Earth.But, as mentioned before, for all its faults this movie does have its moments. And these can usually be found -- and ONLY found -- in the action scenes. The running fight between Van Damme and the bad guy's crew in the plains is pretty good stuff. You don't see a lot of running kung-fu fighting anymore on the screen, and this was very well done.So, terrible acting, terrible writing, but terrific direction and action scenes. Too bad Albert Pyun never made it out of the B-movie market. The man had style. Why did I say 'had?' Well, I've seen some of his movies lately, and it seems he's lost quite a bit of it.

It's a film that you'll still be laughing after watching it five times, as much as you did the first time.  As for director Jay Roach, I find this film to be his best personal achievement, far better than both AUTSIN POWERS films and MYSTERY, ALASKA.  And after watching this film, you'll more than likely agree with me. Ben Stiller stars as Greg Focker (that's F-O-C-K-E-R), a Chicago male nurse who is in love with school teacher Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo).  Just when Greg is about to propose to marriage to Pam, Pam gets a call on her cellular that her younger sister, Debbie (Nicole DeHuff) is getting married in a week after knowing the guy for a few months.  But what is all right with this marriage is that they got permission from Pam and Debbie's parents, Jack Byrnes (Robert DeNiro) and Dian Byrnes (Blythe Danner).  But it's Jack who calls the shots for the family. So as Greg and Pam head over to Long Island for Debbie's wedding, Greg figures that this is the perfect opportunity to get approval from Pam's father to marry her.  But Jack Byrnes is very protective of his first born child and doesn't really care much for Greg.  Greg is very nervous and worried around Jack, and who can blame him, Jack has got to be the most intimidating father of all time.  As Greg keeps making accidental blunders around Jack, it makes Greg even more worried when Pam tells Greg that her father worked as a interrogation agent for the C.I.A.  Also, Jack favors and adores Pam's former fiance Kevin Rawley (Owen Wilson), who is a multimillionare who is a carpenter for a hobby.  So one mistake happens after another builds on top of each other making this a weekend of hell for poor Greg. Where director Jay Roach crashed with his last two comedies (AUSTIN POWERS 2, & MYSTERY, ALASKA) Roach scores again, if not his best score with this film.  I found this along with CHICKEN RUN to be the funniest film of this year.  I was laughing on and on again throughout this entire film that I nearly lost my voice.  And what makes it better is that like AIRPLANE and A FISH CALLED WANDA the jokes keep on coming to by the end you're tired from laughing so much. Both DeNiro and Stiller do very great jobs in this film. Stiller is fun as the poor fella Greg, similar to his Ted character in THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY, Greg tries his hardest to make things right, but they turn out to be the opposite.  And Robert DeNiro is proving that his comedic work is just as excellent as his serious work.  With, ANALYZE THIS, WAG THE DOG, and my favorite film of all time MIDNIGHT RUN, DeNiro is a natural with the comedy genre.  And with this film, it shows that DeNiro still has his talent, after almost losing it in ADVENTURES OF ROCKY & BULLWINKLE.  The rest of the cast are also good, but Owen Wilson stands out as the very impressive Kevin. Before Jay Roach was making this movie, he said that the script was the funniest thing he has ever read.  And by watching this film, you too can see on why this movie is so hysterical.  If Roach continues to make more movies like this one, he'll be a stand out in Hollywood. It's a shame that the American Film Institute has already picked the most funniest films of all time.  Since if they picked the films out later next year, PARENTS would have been at least on the top twenty as the top comeides of all time.  Even when I sit and write reviews, I still get chuckles from thinking about scenes from this movie.  This is quite a impressive fall season, after experiencing one of the most disappoining summers in film history.   With PARENTS, along with TITANS, NURSE BETTY, and ALMOST FAMOUS it seems that this fall there needed to be a funny and witty comedy, and MEET THE PARENTS is it!

We were more than pleasantly surprised!First and foremost, the animation was phenomenal!  The fluid motion and obvious emotion of the characters was a great example of what animation should be!  The animators departed from the more simplistic style of the television series making Digimon The Movie more of an event than a film adaptation.  The photo-realistic background paintings made the settings come alive.  The mixture of computer and traditional animation blended smoothly, one style never overshadowed the other.The story was cohesive though it seemed a bit long in parts.  It breaks down into three acts.  Act One goes into detail about the first experience the Digidestined had with the Digital World and introduces a character named Willis who was mentioned once on the current series up until this writing. Act Two takes place some time after the original Digidestined have saved the Digital World.  Finally, Act Three deals mostly with the new Digidestined.  Willis plays a vital role in all three of these stories though we don't see him interact with the other characters face-to-face until the third act.I'm the last person to try and find some kind of moral lesson or meaning in a movie.

A MAP OF THE WORLD follows Alice over a period of a year, as she is center stage in two tragedies--the little girl's death and her arrest weeks later involving a seemingly unrelated matter.     Alice is married to Howard (David Strathairn), a man who is living his dreams of owning his own dairy farm.  They are urbanites now living in rural Wisconsin.

Alice and Howard, along with their two young daughters live a simple but harried life, that comes crashing down after the death of the little girl.     On paper this sounds like a predictable TV movie, but its strength is not in contrived plot twists, and overly dramatic courtroom scenes, but rather in how one ordinary woman handles herself in the midst of tragedies that have engulfed her.     Sigourney Weaver is wonderful as usual in the role of Alice.  She understands how often one has to heal themselves before they can continue the relationships with the ones around them, even their own children.  Her husband David is supportive but is increasingly frustrated as Alice seems to be using her jail time (they are unable to come up with the bail) for her own interesting form of therapy.

This is the most regretful episode of my life for the film has now been deleted. My life was honestly changed as that half an hour was a real time anomoly, obeying the theory of relativity and breaking that particular convention by immersing me so fully that it seemed to last forever and yet, not long enough. 'Shanghai Triad' does not contain that one off quality, however, it is in itself a fascinating film. The colour scheme, of many Yimou films remains, his use of colour is deeply moving as it becomes sublime and almost 'old school'. You can see movies of the studio system being played out again but in a whole new style. Red is so prominent once again and for reasons we can only speculate. Personally I see the colour red as an exciting colour, it conveys to me a sense of a past in which I did not belong to, how I did not exist. The fascination I have in history pre-1982 and more importantly the early 20th century glamour and ancient history.The splendour of the whole thing is beyond belief, it could almost have the production values of a Hollywood mainstream movie. It shows that perhaps you can create a better effect with lower production values. The Tang household is splendid, but it's vastness perfectly encapsulates a lonely feeling that puts you in the place of the child as well as any cliched point of view shots ever could. It is moments like these that prove Yimou's background as a cinematographer, he is a master of the visual, able to simply show a character's mood in an implicit sweep of camera and minutely fine detail within the mise-en-scene excluding cliche from his work completely. This is the sort of filmmaking we would associate with Ridley Scott, Scott is a visualist, he works with far darker tones than Yimou, which from a personal point of view, makes Yimou my prefered choice, but Scott himself blended both dark and light in 'Thelma and Louise' like Yimou has done for most of his career. The characters themselves have layers of light and dark which are conveyed well in all of their surroundings.This comparison with Scott brings me to the point in Triad when the empathy shifts from the boy to be shared by him and Bijou. This does echo a bit of the Roy Batty syndrome which was probably the reason for 'Blade Runner's' limited success on it's original release, or so says Robert McKee. But Gong Li's performance is outstanding. She nails Bijou's nasty streak to a tee and then compels us to believe that she is more than that. Of course it is helped when the viewer feels that the situation she is in is a frightening one, not unlike mountaineering where one false step could end up in death, at what ever height you are at. Li is one of the finest actresses in the world, not to mention that her beauty is unparalleled. (Despite the fact that she is just four years younger than my mother) The film may not be seen as very moral but it is clear that it has heart as we feel so bad about the events that end the film. Li shows her hardness of character and complete vulnerability then finally her loss of control, shame and regret. This heart is not made of solid stone, rather a quite flexible rubber.It requires a period of reflection, one that does not equal that of 'Raise the Red Lantern' but is the only film to have such a numbing effect since. By now though, I have Lantern in such a high regard that it borders on gaining a mythical quality as I have yet to see it in it's entirety. It's not every day that a heavily opinionated young man will be reduced to a pathetic single syllable, but when Triad is finished, many of you will be reduced to it too, lay back and just clear your head of anything other than the film, all that enters the head will be Wow.

First of all, the bad guy is such a pansy. All he does is walking around and laughing that stupid gitter and never, ever being as bad as he want to be. Who came up with this guy? Did the screenwriters even look at the first two movies. Gary Busey in the first movie he's a real badass and he's cool too. The germans in LETHAL WEAPON 2 are also fantastic. That chubby boss really got on my nerves and Adolf was mean as hell. We're talking carisma. Those bad-guys from the first two made me angry! I got so p****d on them, I'm still angry. They kidnapped Murtaugh's daughter, had salt in his wounds, gave Riggs electric shocks, killed Murtaugh's vietnam'buddy's daughter, the german's were even worse. They killed both Riggs' wife and Rika, and Adolf was coward enough to throw a throwing knife in Riggs' leg before he started the fight. When Riggs ripps down the stilt-house I was cheering and jumping up and down in salvation. Now of course, I wanted such a scene in LETHAL WEAPON 3. Never came...No matter how hard I tried I never got angry on this guy. Not even when Riggs burned the place down, or when the guy shoot Lorna. He was just so boring. I mean, he got scared when the police got to the hockey arena. I mean, what would mr. Joshua had done in a situation like that? Just wondering.Other reasons is the flat script and that the rawness was gone. The end-fight was pitiful when you compare it to the ones in LETHAL WEAPON and LETHAL WEAPON 2. This movie simply isn't brutal enough. Why, oh why couldn't Shane Black write a Lethal 3 to make the same feeling appear. The rawness, the humor, the smart jokes, Murtaugh's problem-jokes (the gurdle, come on!), the badguys, the good guys, everything. And wasn't Martin Riggs supposed to be a lethal weapon. Here he is more of a tame slingshot with a temper. Though I liked Joe Pesci, he's still funny.
