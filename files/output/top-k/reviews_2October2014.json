[{"date":"2 October 2014","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" A movie with a preposterous plot, exotic locations, absurd action sequences, and so much chemistry between attractive actors that we don't care. Gets by well enough on style and star chemistry and the basic allure of watching a tightly-planned caper unfold. A certain sunny sloppiness almost redeems Jon Amiel's throwback caper flick.Connery and Zeta-Jones not only look great together, they work well together, too.Connery and Zeta-Jones are such fun to watch together it almost doesn't matter how little sense the movie makes -- and their relationship is far more gleefully perverse, weirdly chivalrous and surprisingly interesting than the trailer makes it look.Cleverly updates the formula with a sprinkling of fun, fin-DE-millennium touches.Entrapment luxuriates in the best Hollywood big bucks can buy superb sets and cinematography, spectacular locations, expensive stars. During the opening credits the camera glides through a romanticised Manhattan skyline. The steel and chrome gleam, the lights of the skyscrapers are digital jewels and the frame of the screen is dynamically pierced at odd angles by a laser-like red beam. This sequence holds out a tantalising promise for the movie, particularly when the camera rests on a sinuous cat-burglar entering a high, tightly shut window with elegant ease. We expect an exciting, sleek and slick caper movie, something like To Catch a Thief (1954) or at least (let's not be too greedy) Arabesque (1966). It's not the stars' fault that Entrapment is disappointing. Sean Connery gets the Cary Grant treatment here, made the object of his co-star's desire. Catherine Zeta-Jones chases him just as surely and shrewdly as Audrey Hepburn chased Grant in Charade (1963). Given the 40-year age gap between them, her instigation is presumably meant to make their romance less risible, but it's an unnecessary precaution. Close-ups reveal Connery's skin is losing the battle with time, but his appeal was never really based on youth.Connery's stardom rests on his ability to represent a man completely at ease with his masculinity and his sexuality better than any other star of his generation. There was always something a bit suspect about prettier men like Paul Newman (cf. Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, 1958) while tougher guys such as Clint Eastwood seemed too stiff to be turned on by anything but seaminess (Tightrope, 1984). Connery, however, deploys his physical size, gruff and commanding voice, a glance both sure and sly and a stillness that can pounce into graceful movement at any moment to project a sexuality so confident it can afford to be nonchalant and playful. We are easily convinced that what Zeta-Jones wants from him, give or take a couple of billion dollars, is delivery on the promise of a rough good time.Zeta-Jones more than holds her own here. Connery may be the object of her desire, but Zeta-Jones is meant to be the object of ours. The sight of her leotard-clad figure practising gymnastics in order to avoid the burglar alarm's lasers is more spectacular and pleasurable than the action set pieces. She emerges from Entrapment a full-blown star, flirting with such intelligent sultriness not even a man of Connery's strength can resist. Good alone but even better together, the two have an undoubted chemistry.Entrapment aspires to be nothing more than a bit of glamorous nonsense, but although it has done all right by the glamour, it has perhaps done too well by the nonsense. Very badly structured, the story begins to feel ripped off half way through, its maze of double-crossings never delivering a narrative payoff. At the unbelievable and tacked-on ending, even a cynic might feel a twinge of discomfort at the lack of even a half-hearted gesture towards a moral rationale for the action. We're meant to root for these thieves just because they look gorgeous, seem meant for each other and are good at their work.The fact that the combination of sex and capital as spectacle is thought to need no other rationale says a lot about millennial culture, and would make a good subject for another movie. But this is by-numbers genre work which has forgotten a few sums. Entrapment fails as a caper film because it neglects that fundamental ingredient - a credible plot, evidently something even the biggest chequebooks in Hollywood can no longer guarantee.

The tag for the film is accurate I guess, this legend did have it coming for sure with so many variations out there at the time...most notably and laughably the Kevin Costner debacle. Also not forgetting the Patrick Bergin Robin Hood flick that was emulating Costner's version!Of course being a Brooks film the cast is made up of all his regulars...and I'm sure if his older regulars weren't dead he'd have used them too. Amy Yasbeck begins her brief Brooks career here as Marian before rejoining Brooks for Dracula. Dick Van Pattern is back after working with Brooks in 'High Anxiety' and 'Spaceballs', Megan Cavanagh and Matt Porretta both went on to Dracula along with Yasbeck and finally the magnificent pair of Dom Deluise and Robert Ridgely are both Brooks film veterans.Naturally there has been many liberties taken with the plot...well actually its based around other Robin Hood movies really, nothing to do with the actual fable at all. Its clear to see the classic Errol Flynn version and the classic animated Disney version are the two main influences here. Brooks pretty much follows both of these films scene for scene whilst adding his own unique brand of spoofery. This whole approach does actually work well in all honesty because you can enjoy the cartoonish tomfoolery and it also kinda harks back to a different age of cinema. Whether this was intentional or not I'm not sure, it probably just happened because they were spoofing two classic films but the quaint visuals, simple effects and colourful characters are very appealing.There is a thin line between the silly childish humour and the slightly more risky adult humour which I think is handled well. I say adult humour but its not really that bad, just a touch of toilet humour. Whilst most of the laughs fall flat I can't deny there are some nice chuckles to be had and some clever imaginative send-ups. The usual blend of visual slapstick and cheesy dialog is to be expected but much of it is all in the delivery and luckily this movie does have some noteworthy comedic performances.Its quite a surprise that Elwes does actually put in a solid funny performance as Robin Hood, what's even more surprising is the fact he does have a slightly similar resemblance to Flynn...a blonde Flynn. His little tufts of facial hair, the fact he's British, that wry smug smile of his when he fights and all tied together in the classic green and brown attire. At the same time Richard Lewis is also a great Prince John! I loved how his mole kept moving across his face in each scene and his 80's mullet hairdo, plus this guy can deliver a funny line. He has this great whiny nervous tone to his voice which really comes to life when he panics and cries 'hurt them! hurt them!!'.I also must confess to enjoying Brooks small cameo as a Rabbi, could of gone another way but the old ones are the best ones I guess. Eric Kramer is also surprisingly amusing as the towering Little John, not so much to say but he is good with the visual comedy side of things as was Blankfield as the blind 'Blinkin'...sounds utterly cringeworthy I know but it does work. It was only Rees as the Sheriff of Rottingham (*groan*) that seemed to swing and miss for me, clearly trying way too hard to hammer those funny lines in. Same could be said for Tracy Ullman as the witch who didn't even really need to be there.As I'm sure everybody knows by now a film like this is all about the delivery, the comedic performances of the actors, if that aspect is nailed then the film is reasonably secured. Its not about the effects or sets or costumes...although its nice if they look good but end of the day its whether you can laugh with the film and not at it for being crap. Personally I think this movie just about makes the grade, its earned somewhat of a cult status over time and I can see why. There is a lot of embarrassing crud in here this is true (Dave Chappelle), some visual gags are terribly simple bordering on downright infantile whilst some of the visuals are very basic.

But why is Lion king just as good now when we're adults?My own theory of this matter is (without mention the nostalgic factor) is that the movie has a perfect balance of light and dark. Not only in the sadness\/comedy area but also in the actual nature way. Sceneries are different as the journey goes on and something happens inside of us during that journey. We feel uncomfortable in the desert and in the dark, and happy and relaxed in the jungle with all the green. This mix of emotions bring a tone to Lion king thats hard to shake off. Lion king affects you after you've watched it and when you've seen it, doesn't matter how many times you've watched it, you tell someone you've seen it.

Not only in the sadness\/comedy area but also in the actual nature way. Sceneries are different as the journey goes on and something happens inside of us during that journey. We feel uncomfortable in the desert and in the dark, and happy and relaxed in the jungle with all the green. This mix of emotions bring a tone to Lion king thats hard to shake off. Lion king affects you after you've watched it and when you've seen it, doesn't matter how many times you've watched it, you tell someone you've seen it. And that person will agree and probably say yes, I've watched it like a thousand times, It so good and you'll reply yes I've seen it a thousand times before too just to make sure to the other person that he does not like it more than you. I think its parental responsibility to pass this genius movie onto the coming generations. Lion king will always be one of the satisfaction marks, movie based.

Kevin Costner is in my top 5 actors of all time (ranked third). and the soundtrack made up almost entirely of Elvis Presley tracks is superb.

He is always reliable, but here he is truly awesome. Overall the movie is silly, but I enjoyed a lot of it. The likable cast is headed by good old KC, Kurt Russell (always a good Elvis) Courtney Cox (in a career low performance, with awful accent to boot) her former husband David Arquette, Christian Slater, Kevin Pollack, Ice T also has a small role.It's not hard to see what attracted a cast like that to a movie about a gang of criminals robbing a casino dressed as Elvis. Sold it differently, I think it might have done differently. It had an excellent trailer, but seems confused about what type of movie it is. The robbery is superbly shot, as is the finale, but some scenes miss the target inbetween, and it runs a little too long. Cox is the obvious weak link here, not just for her performance, but her character is confusing too, as we never quite understand her motives, and her kid is as annoying kid actors get.But this is Costner's show, and his likability excuses the unpleasant violence his character often uses.For my money 3000 Miles To Graceland is a highly professional piece of work, suspenseful, with a good sense of pace and atmosphere it makes for perfect entertainment.Given the talent involved, I'm surprised this failed to find an audience.

It has some of the best characters in a Disney movie, and some of the most annoying, it has some of the best songs in a Disney movie, yet some of the most forgettable. Filled with greats and not-very-goods, it nearly looks like it was done by more than a single studio- because the moments that are good- are really good, but those who are not, are sometimes extremely annoying.So let's begin with the good parts shall we?I'll begin with Frollo, which, in my honest opinion- is the greatest Disney villain ever! I mean, God! It's even an enigma how this complex and twisted villain even appeared in a movie that is originally for kids... Frollo does terrible things yet he keeps insisting on how he is a righteous man, convincing himself. He fears God yet still do those terrible things- always blaming the others. When he wants Esmeralda he sees it as a sin, and we see all the twisted visuals in his mind- like many people watch and judge him for his acts. Good lord that's a complex villain. In my opinion he is truly the high-part for this movie.Now, also Quasimodo is a great character- though good-heartened he is mislead on thinking he is a monster by Frollo, and keeps in the shadows fearing people's reactions of his appearance.The characters of Esmeralda and Phebis aren't as interesting though they are okay I guess, just more regular and not-conflicted people. I mean, it looks like the movie is going to challenge Phebis' goodness against his will to obey, but it was obvious on how it's going to end on that part.(And here's the part why I added a spoiler warning) Though what I did like is them being together at the end - I thought it was brilliant! Finally a movie that doesn't sell us that if we're goodhearted enough we'll get the girl- finally a movie that says Sometimes, you just can't get what you wanted- but you must learn to accept it- just brilliant!Another great part are the visuals and the animation- this movie is BEAUTIFUL, it looks great and the atmosphere is great, with the orchestral music truly adding a lot to the atmosphere.Now, about the music- really only 2 songs were truly memorable and great with the others being entirely forgettable, but The bells of Notre-dame and especially the song Hellfire we're memorable and Hellfire also being visually magnificent and with a lot of content.So now I'm going to address them... The Gargoyles... God I hate them so much- every time they were in the film it felt like the film took 10 steps backwards, they were not funny, really annoying and every time they went in I facepalmed. You know what? If they were imaginary, only a product of Quasimodo's loneliness I would have tolerated them. It nearly looked like they are indeed a part of his imagination at the beginning. But no... they helped in the final confrontation, proving they are real- just awful. They had no meaning and we're just annoying me when they were on screen.Oh right- the final confrontation! The confrontation between Quasimodo and Frollo is one of the most epic ones.So- this movie had extremely well done characters and moments, but at the other side, there are annoying characters and boring moments. But is this movie a good one in general? Well, yes!

But no... they helped in the final confrontation, proving they are real- just awful. They had no meaning and we're just annoying me when they were on screen.Oh right- the final confrontation! The confrontation between Quasimodo and Frollo is one of the most epic ones.So- this movie had extremely well done characters and moments, but at the other side, there are annoying characters and boring moments. But is this movie a good one in general? Well, yes! Though it has it's forgettable and bad moments and characters the parts which are great- are truly great.If you haven't seen it- you should defiantly check it out.Recommended 8\/10.

Those expectations are dashed quickly. This is, after all, directed by Roger Corman. There's nothing frightening or mysterious about this. Instead the movie goes for laughs, as two rival sorcerors\/wizards\/magicians (Price and Karloff) go head to head with each other, with Lorre stuck in the middle - sometimes a raven, sometimes a man, sometimes a bit of both. Yes, it's a rather silly movie, which unfortunately creates expectations by being named after Poe's poem. From time to time it works in that it brings forth a few chuckles - but it doesn't accomplish much else.To give them credit, the cast seemed to take this seriously enough and played their parts well, although I understand from what I've read that the three leads did recognize the sheer silliness of it all and had their share of fun while making it. But a few chuckles and a decent cast aside, this just isn't a particularly good movie.

The links these films share is that they're collaborations between Teshigahara, novelist Kobo Abe and composer Toru Takemitsu, they're shot in B&W, and they offer interesting takes on one's identity and how its fragility may be manipulated.Woman of the Dunes is the best of the trilogy and one of the greatest accomplishments from the Japanese New Wave. The story follows an entomologist getting tricked by the villagers into living with a mysterious widow, and digging up sand for them, which gets sold illegally. The woman's life is doing nothing but digging sand for them, and the protagonist scoffs at that very idea, however he slowly realizes that the life he left back in the city is just as unfulfilling as the eternal sand-digging Sysiphus-style.He develops Stockholm syndrome and falls in love with the woman. Lots of things happen, and in the end, his personality has completely turned topsy-turvy and is torn to pieces (evidenced via the water ripples in his reflection). He chooses to stay in the dunes, and his name (Jumpei Niki) is revealed through a document appearing on-screen. His opinions on the dullness of city life are apparent in the beginning of the film, where he talks about how in the city the only things that make you a person are certificates, documents, social conventions, papers and more papers. It was evident that nobody in the city cared for him because no one came to search for him later on when he was stuck in the village. Once a prisoner, there were people who acknowledged him, be it the sand woman, or, to a whole different extent, the villagers. Yes, shoveling up sand for days and days only to help his captors is pointless, but the life he left behind gave him even less fulfillment.There is a lot of visual symbolism. The most obvious example is that throughout the film, Jumpei's figure is shown behind slats and bars, thus symbolizing his captivity (this effect is also used extensively by Yoshida and Kobayashi, who made films more or less at the same time). Notice how the opening credits feature various stamps, grotesque drawings of urban images in midst of sporadically spread lines, resembling a dune swallowing up a city, much like the dune life swallows up a city man. And then of course, there's the insect Niki collects, which actually catches its prey the same way the villagers caught Niki. Masks of all kinds are also used throughout the trilogy.The marvelous B&W photography of sand is, of course, the most prominent visual motif and perfectly captures the ubiquitous sand's intruding nature. This expresses itself nicely during the extreme face close- ups, where we see the sand accumulated in Niki's and the woman's pores. In the desert, time means nothing yet Niki, coming from a city, checks his watch all the time as a mean to reflect his technical, control freak-like mind.The performances are marvelous and unforgettable, the locations varied between sandy nothingness and a claustrophobic sand-ridden set, and the most important scenes are slow but they nonetheless stick with you.

Françoise is a lean and feeble boy, from a petit bourgeois family, he cannot do sports (swimming is an exception) by virtue of his heart condition, he knows Maïté is his soul mate, but they can never be lovers, after he is sexually aroused by his rural classmate Serge (Rideau), son of a farmer with Italian lineage and whose elder brother would later fall in battle at the front line (after being unwillingly transported back to Algeria since Madame Alvarez refuses to offer a helping hand). A boarding school bromance is burgeoning, they become close friends and Françoise comes out to Maïté, she calmly accepts it with sincere encouragement, meanwhile for Serge, his tryout with Françoise is more or less out of a young boy's curiosity, in fact, he is more interested in Maïté, who abstains form his courtship in light of Françoise. Thankfully, it is not a clichéd love triangle, instead it is a more dynamic quartet, the fourth force comes from Henri (Gorny), an Algerian-born French exile who is newly transferred to the class, he has lost his father in the war and becomes extremely cynical to the mainland bourgeois class (who is apathetic to the end of Algeria's colonization) and hostile to the radical leftists and communists (who are in favor of Algeria's independence). He is the alien, brings a radio in the class, picks on Serge and provokes Françoise for his sexuality, openly defies his teacher Madama Alvarez and reluctantly to accept the help from Monsieur Morelli (Nolot), until finally decides to drop out before the exam and by coincidence, meets Maïté in the communist headquarter in the still of the night, where her kindness thaws his malicious intention.Eventually all four gather together for an excursion near the riverside with wild reeds waving around, as they let off their most honest and profound feelings, it is also a siren call to culminate the rite-of-passage of their blazing youth. The ultimate take of a 360 degree shot sterlingly singles out the lush atmosphere with a meaningful punchline, a lyrical rendition of the precious moments in one's adolescence, feeling love, experiencing heartbreak, accepting disappointment and facing an unknown future. Téchiné magnificently teases out impressive and heartfelt performances from these four young actors, Morel, Bouchez and Gorny all rush into the top 10 tier of my yearly rank. Morel is unpolished but a pitch perfect choice for Françoise's sensitivity and integrity; Bouchez is a legitimate sensation, her Maïté, undergoes the choppiest emotional journey in the film, is utterly compelling in every frame; Gorny is detestable at first, then segues into a more sympathetic character thanks to his unfettering ire and the flitting touchiness for a wounded soul. Rideau's Serge, is offered less material to chew on apart from his jock virility, but his unaffected detachment denotes an alternative psyche in the society which hardly changes. WILD REEDS is an intimately potent prose on how a controversial political situation can erode and alter the mindset of a young generation. Remarkably, it never begin to pall from its poetic aesthetics and robust narrative. It is deservingly a capstone in Téchiné's staunch career orbit.

The ultimate take of a 360 degree shot sterlingly singles out the lush atmosphere with a meaningful punchline, a lyrical rendition of the precious moments in one's adolescence, feeling love, experiencing heartbreak, accepting disappointment and facing an unknown future. Téchiné magnificently teases out impressive and heartfelt performances from these four young actors, Morel, Bouchez and Gorny all rush into the top 10 tier of my yearly rank. Morel is unpolished but a pitch perfect choice for Françoise's sensitivity and integrity; Bouchez is a legitimate sensation, her Maïté, undergoes the choppiest emotional journey in the film, is utterly compelling in every frame; Gorny is detestable at first, then segues into a more sympathetic character thanks to his unfettering ire and the flitting touchiness for a wounded soul. Rideau's Serge, is offered less material to chew on apart from his jock virility, but his unaffected detachment denotes an alternative psyche in the society which hardly changes. WILD REEDS is an intimately potent prose on how a controversial political situation can erode and alter the mindset of a young generation. Remarkably, it never begin to pall from its poetic aesthetics and robust narrative. It is deservingly a capstone in Téchiné's staunch career orbit.

Françoise is a lean and feeble boy, from a petit bourgeois family, he cannot do sports (swimming is an exception) by virtue of his heart condition, he knows Maïté is his soul mate, but they can never be lovers, after he is sexually aroused by his rural classmate Serge (Rideau), son of a farmer with Italian lineage and whose elder brother would later fall in battle at the front line (after being unwillingly transported back to Algeria since Madame Alvarez refuses to offer a helping hand). A boarding school bromance is burgeoning, they become close friends and Françoise comes out to Maïté, she calmly accepts it with sincere encouragement, meanwhile for Serge, his tryout with Françoise is more or less out of a young boy's curiosity, in fact, he is more interested in Maïté, who abstains form his courtship in light of Françoise.

Not only is it an excellent film, it's a really relevant one. It was true back in 1993, but I think it's even more true in today's world. It's the little things in the daily lives of people that can drive them crazy, as evidenced in this film. The film itself is a little clunky at times, but it has a hard-boiled script which created tough characters, but these characters work thanks to the tremendous acting.Schumacher's film is based off a simple premise and that is what would happen if someone went crazy over the daily stresses of life. This one man named William Foster only wanted to attend the birthday bash of his ex-wife's daughter. But of course he is dealt with being stuck in traffic on the hottest day of the year, so he begins a mental collapse with those standing in his way paying for it. Whether it's an over-priced soda or some gang members getting in his way, he is hell-bent on letting society know his intentions. Now it's up to a retiring cop, Prendergast to stop Foster's urban rampage.This film is incredibly acted. Michael Douglas gives one of his best performances as Foster. He does well in balancing the fine line between calmness and a quick temper to boot. While not his best performance, Robert Duvall does a good job as the elder cop on Foster's tail and is suffering with domestic issues.Overall, Falling Down can be seen as a satire at times, but its message is clear as day and it practically means that our society is crumbling apart. While this film is also seen as a crime drama, there is dark humor aplenty. There are some witty one-liners that Douglas would utter every so often. This film can also be seen as racist at times, but I don't believe Schumacher is playing to the stereotypes. Every urban area has their own nationality, so each race is fair game. This is a very good, action-packed film that effectively tackles an every day issue in our lives. I rate this film 9\/10.

The Shawshank Redemption always gives to me the feeling that it is separated between two very different acts. Although this separation isn't balanced in the runtime, it is, in a way, the manner in which the film is constructed.At the beginning, we are introduced to Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a man accused of murdering his wife and her lover. He is sent to Shawshank Prison for life, and there he meets Red (Freeman), the man who can get you anything you want. Over the years, Andy will become good friends with Red, be brutally abused by a group of aggressive homosexuals, and participate in a series of scams orchestrated by the warden. All the time Andy spends in incarceration seems like a living hell, thus setting up the dark, absorbing environment of most of the movie's runtime. By the time we get to the last part of the film, we see a pleasant payoff that presents itself in a different tone, one that while sometimes present in the movie's gritty prison setting, lashes out fully in the last few scenes.Directed masterfully by Frank Darabont, and with career defining performances from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, Shawshank lives on as a cinematic landmark. It's a movie that captures the essence of good storytelling and lives up to its legacy through that, while also being a competently made film, with a diverse soundtrack and a beautifully planned production design.For me, The Shawshank Redemption represents assuming responsibility and coming to terms with a complicated situation, while also having the strenght to triumph over adversity. As Andy says, hope is what keeps a man mentally stable and in my estimation the most powerful feeling in a movie like this.Rating 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"2 October 2014","score":"","review":" This subtitle might sound a little cheesy, but in fact the movie presents us with a story of having to cope with a harsh reality, and in the end, managing to move on from it.
