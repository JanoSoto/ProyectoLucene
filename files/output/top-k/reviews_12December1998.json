On the Town is just great of fun to watch, especially for native new yorkers who weren't around in the late 1940's when it was made. Funny how the city looks so much the same. Kelly is at his usual charming best, a little weak on voice and dramatic technique but more than makes up for it with his stupendous dancing and that smile. Sinatra is perfect as the shlub with the nice plain face who Betty Garrett's taxi driver can't help but fall for. Some of the song and dance numbers lose you but New York New York and the title number are priceless. Again don't expect Singin in the Rain, because missing here are the very lavish numbers and statements about Hollywood et al. This is simply super entertainment, MgM technicolor style.

It was not a GREAT film, and the one thing the trek genre needs is a GREAT film.  It falls short in several respects. The special effects are not done my ILM this time, and it shows.  There are shortcomings and they are obvious.  The first half of the film was ok, but then it mires itself in trekdom, never to return.  No particular plot is explored to its fullest extent, probably the result of the entire ensemble cast requiring some screen time.  And please quit giving us Andriod 101 in every single film -- OK, WE GET IT!  He's a machine that wants to be human, NO DO SOMETHING WITH THAT.  This film left a very bland taste in my mouth. Please, for the next film, pull in some blood from outside the Berman, Piller, Frakes triumverite and make a REAL MOVIE.  And would one of them please shell out the cash for a real space battle once (along the magnitude of season 6 DS9 battles).  Quit super-scooping explosive gas and just shoot each other.  But, for about an hour of good laughs and the mediocre continuation of the series, ST9 fits the bill.

This movie is not really science fiction although some say it is the best sci-fi movie to date.  It is more of a fairy tale, which is set in a galaxy far, far away. It has all the ingredients of a fairy tale good vs. evil, the dashing prince charmings coming to the rescue of a princess, and lots of daring do along the way.  It's almost like the story of King Arthur in outer space. What sells it to the audience?  At that time, its special effects were considered a marvel of cinematic movie making.  Today, the special effects would be considered, well, okay.  The characters have become household names Darth Vader, Obi-Wan Kanobi, Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Chewbacca, R2D2, C3PO, and Princess Leia.  People, as a whole, have spent a zillion dollars on Star Wars' toys, video games, etc.  As a result, George Lucas became very rich and famous.  The movie's score is the best masterpiece of cinematic music ever recorded on film.  Lucas does a brilliant job of directing.  The film won 7 Academy Awards.  Harrison Ford became an international super star.  This all says a lot for just one movie!!! (well, not a whole lot...I could have gone on further and wrote a book about the success of this film.)  So, why not claim it as the GREATEST MOVIE ON EARTH IN THE 20TH CENTURY...(so far)?
