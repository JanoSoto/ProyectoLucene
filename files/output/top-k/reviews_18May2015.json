Following on from The Road Warrior--a film which created a much-imitated cinematic aesthetic of its own (I'm looking at you Waterworld and Steel Dawn)--Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome finds Max having to shoulder a mantle of responsibility he doesn't want.Lacking any of the high-octane action of its predecessors until its final act, Beyond Thunderdome is a noticeably more emotional affair. This can perhaps be attributed to George Miller famously losing his passion for the film (after the death of his long time friend and producer in a helicopter crash while scouting locations for this movie) and standing aside to let George Ogilvie take the reins, though Miller would stay on to direct the action sequences. The pathos of characters like Pig Killer (enslaved for trying to 'feed the kids'-- a man whose life means less than swine) moments like Blaster's 'reveal' and Savannah's tell of the children escaping a 'Pox- eclipse' (especially the children chanting Captain Walker's final message, literally carved in stone, before he set out into the wasteland with 20 other survivors-- presumably the last adults--to seek help) and the arrival in the ruined dust-bowl of what was once Australia's Sydney Harbour, particularly tug on the heart strings. Despite this, Beyond Thunderdome's action is still excellent. The Thunderdome sequence may be the most unique spin on gladiatorial combat ever conceived, and the final chase, though short and literally 'on rails' is still an exciting, brutal pursuit.By introducing the children at the oasis and changing its focus, Beyond Thunderdome has come in for the same criticism levelled at Return of the Jedi going cutesy. But the kids of Crack in the Earth become a responsibility Max has to shoulder, when--in their naive optimism--a small group of them leave in the night to find home, he follows them into the wastes to save their lives. In his choice, Max completes a character arc, from a vengeful husband and father, to aimless, selfish, burned-out drifter, to a man who literally leads a small exodus and whose self-sacrifice saves the others. Perhaps due to American dollars helping finance the flick, some goofy humour drips in--some slapstick skillet-to-the-face jokes, some schadenfreude moments (usually at Angry Anderson's character Ironbar's expense, though a poor spectator of the Thunderdome match also springs to mind as I write)--changing the tone somewhat compared to its beloved predecessor. I love this flick and genuinely think it's on a par with The Road Warrior. It has its own identity and emotional arc which I find really satisfying. Maurice Jarre's score is superb, from the clanging, jarring (no pun intended) percussion of the entrance to bartertown, to the orchestral strains of skyraft and the lament for Sydney Harbour, Jarre helps to heighten the emotional core of the movie. All in all, Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome is a fitting end to Gibson's tenure as Max it has heart, it has action, it has a few surprises (like the fact that Tina Turner can genuinely act) and deserves to be viewed in a better light.

A young man, Jim Craig, loses his father and needs money to keep the family farm; he finds work on a ranch, where he does odd jobs, and becomes involved with the owner's daughter. Subsequent events test him, and eventually he reaches manhood. A simple universal tale of an everyman coming of age, based on a poem by Australian Banjo Paterson. The film is not strong on plot and is uneven on character development; however, occasional excitement erupts in conjunction with a herd of wild horses, which are beautiful to behold and lovingly photographed.The performances range from professional to competent to passable. Obviously cast for marquee value, Kirk Douglas plays two estranged twin brothers, although no camera trickery is utilized to place him in the same frame with himself; while always a pro, Douglas is more effective as the stern ranch owner than as the colorful peg-legged bearded prospector, which is more caricature than character. The film's nominal lead, Tom Burlinson, is colorless and bland; while somewhat pleasant looking and solidly built, he is not the young John Wayne that the film needs, and he lacks the charisma to carry such a slight film and engage the audience in his struggles. Burlinson fades into the background whenever veterans Douglas or Jack Thompson, wasted in a small thankless role, are on screen. However, Burlinson's love interest is played by Sigrid Thornton, a young actress with dark intense eyes, who bears a striking resemblance to Elizabeth McGovern; unfortunately, her looks are more memorable than her performance.The first feature film by director George Miller, The Man from Snowy River shows the director's roots in television; the budgetary constraints are evident, and the staging static. However, the scenic mountain locations of Victoria, Australia, are often breathtaking and reminiscent of the old American West. Bruce Rowland's music is a major asset, and Keith Wagstaff's photography of mountains and wild horses is excellent, although the camera work is at times self conscious; an upward zoom for a sweeping bird's eye view of the two young people on horseback dwarfed in a spectacular landscape does little but call attention to itself. The Man from Snowy River is uneven, leisurely paced, and demands patience; other than Douglas, the actors do not stand out. The film is an earnest effort by a new-to-film director, worth seeing, but ultimately it fails to make a lasting impression.

Place functions as a key element in Fargo. The blindingly white winter of North Dakota's Fargo is used evocatively and satirically, and the folksy dialect of the mid-westerners is exaggerated and distinct. The immaculate, whitewashed setting, and the carefully constructed cinematography acts as a prime vehicle for fostering the outrageous story as it unfolds in perfect chaos. The stylistic device of the 'true story' claim, manipulates audiences into suspending their belief and accepting the film as it is. ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"18 May 2015","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" It's 2013. The world is desolated after wars. A man with no name (Kevin Costner) travels the American west with his donkey Bill. He tries to avoid any civilization. He's performing in a settlement when the Holnists led by General Bethlehem (Will Patton) come demanding Pure Blood recruits. The man is taken, his donkey is killed and he's given the name Shakespeare. He escapes and finds a mail truck. He wears the uniform and takes the mailbag. He uses the 15 year old letters to con his way into Pineview pretending to represent a restored federal government. He is overwhelmed by the town's hopes. Ford Lincoln Mercury is taken by him and begs to be sworn in as a postman. Sheriff Briscoe is suspicious and kicks him out. Abby and Michael can't have children. They decide to have Abby conceive a child with the postman.I really like the idea of communication reviving civilization. If only the movie stuck with that simple idea. Not to mention the fearsome three hours running time. Like Waterworld, this has a lot of goofy post-apocalyptic ideas that take the seriousness out of the movie. The Holnists should lose some of the silliness while maintaining the dark menace. Abby and Michael should be much more simplified. Trying to romanticize Abby and the postman is a fool's errant. It would so much better to have a single Abby falling for the postman. I like Ford Lincoln Mercury's story but not his name. The movie needs to simplify and shorten the plot. It has some great sentimental melodrama but it's destroyed by the overlong overwrought silliness.
