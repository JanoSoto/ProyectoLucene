I work hard, I love, I laugh - but there's something not right. A lack of identity perhaps? Or maybe a lack of purpose? Or are those one and the same? This is about a man who has been living a life he's hated. Most of his life has been wasted. In face of death, he decides to stop being, and to start living. He decides to give himself purpose - to do something for himself, and for the people he cares about. It is like a dream. The beautiful sunsets over the ocean and the pink and orange sky that fill the film are like a painting. We too often dull our lives. Whether it is killing our souls with the routine of a job you hate, or escaping reality by abusing drugs, many of us live lives we dislike because it is often too hard to do the right and good thing. It is easy to procrastinate. It is easy to stand aside in fear. Even when your wife leaves you, and your son cuts you off. It is hard to stop doing what you 'have' to do in order to do what you want to do - what you need to do. This is your life, and it is ticking away. I'm not saying you must quit your job to enjoy life. But if you can't enjoy life because of your job - then change now, because otherwise you will just keep living for your job while your life falls away until there is nothing left but your job.In face of death, George (Kevin Kline - the best I've ever seen him) finally realizes that he can make life worth living. Not just for himself - but for his son, and for others around him. The great shame is that he realizes this so late in his life. A wonderful movie. It takes you, the viewer, and makes you think about how you are putting off your life. How you are always delaying. You absorb yourself in work, and school, and drugs, and video games, and whatever else. Life is passing you by. And one day, you will wake up and realize you never built your house - you never gave yourself the life you wanted.I want to volunteer in Africa. I have wanted to for 2 years now. I am always putting it off. Too much school. Too much work. And one day, I fear I will wake up on my deathbed, wondering how I never did it. This movie always strikes me, and strikes me hard. I must build my house now - not later. Now. Or my life will have been a waste.

Risky Business, Just One of the Guys, Better off Dead, Woman in Red, Sixteen Candles, National Lampoon's Vacation, Fletch, Valley Girl, Revenge of the Nerds, Back to the Future, 3 O'Clock High, Weird Science and countless more.Many of these movies (and others unlisted) defined the 80's for me. I can watch them again and be taken back to a century that I truly loved.Then there were the 80's movies that I missed, purposefully or otherwise. Some of these I still haven't seen because they look totally uninteresting. Pretty in Pink, Footloose, and St. Elmo's Fire are some that I chose not to experience. They all appeared very unappealing to me for the actors and themes. Kevin Bacon as a dancer? Pretty boy Rob Lowe? Pass.I've seen bits and pieces of Elmo's Fire on cable, not enough to have stored in memory, but enough to know that I did the right thing by skipping it when it came out. I'm not interested at all in the conquests of Rob Lowe, nor do I care about the slutty adventures of Demi Moore. Andrew McCarthy is a bore, and Judd Nelson will always be John Bender to me. I can't see him getting into politics! In my opinion this movie does not define the 80's at all. I didn't know any rich fantasy people who dressed in high fashion like this, and didn't care to. These characters were self absorbed and unlikeable. The dialogue is bad and the acting is average at best. If you want to experience the real 80's then see some of the films at the top of my list. Try Streets of Fire with Michael Pare - NOT St. Elmo's Fire with Rob Lowe. Forget the soundtrack. Nothing memorable here either. Music in the 80's was much better than that. Instead of his mediocre St. Elmo's Fire song try listening to John Parr's Naughty Naughty which is much more powerful. Take it from someone who lived through the 80's.

Shortly after reading the book, we were shown the 1992 film adaptation in that class. I first heard about this much earlier adaptation of the book around that time, but it took me seven years to finally get around to watching it, even though I had been intending to watch it for quite a while by the time I did. I knew this version was widely praised, which gave me fairly high expectations. It may not have fully met these expectations, but if not, at least it came very close, and I would say it's just as memorable as the book.In the 1930's Great Depression era, George Milton and Lennie Small are two migrant ranch workers in California who dream of having their own place someday. Lennie is big and strong, but he is also mentally handicapped, and George has to look after him. He means well, but often gets into trouble, doing things he doesn't realize are wrong, and George is always the one who has to get him out of it. After leaving town to escape from a mob started by Lennie feeling a woman's dress, the two of them soon get jobs on another ranch. Here, their co-workers include Candy, an elderly man who won't likely be able to work on the ranch for much longer, and Crooks, a crippled black man who faces discrimination because of his race in this era. The ranch owner's son is Curley, a belligerent young man who hates Lennie from the moment he first sees him, and has a lonely wife named Mae, whom he tends to neglect, but doesn't want any other men to have anything to do with her, being the jealous type.The cast really helps carry this film, including the two co-stars, Burgess Meredith as George and Lon Chaney Jr. (the son of the Man of a Thousand Faces, Lon Chaney) as Lennie. Both of these actors fit their roles well, and are both memorable. Chaney's portrayal of a mentally handicapped character may not be flawless, but it's still good. Most of the other cast members' performances also stand out, and it helps that they were clearly given a good script. There are times when the score doesn't fit the scene very well, and there may be certain other slight flaws, but they are far from enough to ruin the movie. In addition to the acting and script, there are a number of very interesting characters, several of whom one can easily sympathize with, and some very well crafted heartbreaking scenes, starting with Candy losing his dog. The score in these scenes does fit them well. This adaptation of Steinbeck's novella was also very nicely filmed.This first ever film adaptation of a John Steinbeck story is not perfect, but overall, it's still very good, and very faithful to the book. It does take some liberties, such as giving Curley's wife a name, and they obviously left out some detail, but the differences are minor, at least for the most part. Anyone who has read the book knows that Of Mice and Men is not a cheerful story. It's a tragic drama set in a tragic era, and this movie is much the same as the book, so keep that in mind if you're planning to watch it. If you're an emotional kind of person, you could easily find tears in your eyes at times, and if you're not, you could still at least come close to tears. If you've read the book and were impressed with it, and\/or you like dramas from the classic era in general, I really think this 1939 screen adaptation is worth checking out.

It also means that The Ruling Class is now regarded in film circles as a significant movie. Of course almost any film student will tell you that significant is not necessarily synonymous with entertaining, critically acclaimed, or well-made.So if you are considering a purchase or have just had a confused post-purchase viewing experience the following discussion may prove useful. This is a British film, one I originally watched on the BBC a few months after its release. It was neither a critical success (mixed reviews) nor a box office sensation and hitting the BBC so soon after a theatrical release back then was not much different from going direct-to-video today.It was a counter-culture film, and much of my original enjoyment came from the obvious tweaking of certain cultural and political institutions. Much of this stuff has lost its power and appeal over the years.It has a lot of expressionistic and allegorical elements; this sort of stuff was (and is) relatively rare in an English language film and probably accounts for much of the current cult status of the film. The black comedy aspect of these elements has held up very well and you will understand the film better and enjoy it more if you don't take it literally.Jack, the 14th Earl of Gurney (Peter O'Toole), has recently inherited the family title and a place in the House of Lords of the British Parliament. The story actually begins with a cheerfully provocative black comedy sequence as his father, the 13th Earl (Harry Andrews), accidentally hangs himself while performing what is apparently a long-standing self-pleasuring ritual.Jack believes himself Jesus Christ and his family believes that they can get their hands on the estate once he produces an heir. Their idea being to have him committed and then become guardians of the child. Carolyn Seymour plays his uncle's mistress who is brought in to marry Jack. Her character throws a wrench in the works by falling in love with her new husband. Other than Jack, Seymour's character is the only one that undergoes any real change during the course of the film and she sells this transformation quite nicely while also providing one of the best striptease sequences you are likely to stumble across in a mainstream movie.As already noted the running length is 154 minutes, that's about the length of two movies and if the film were being produced today I suspect that it would be done as two separate films. Indeed it is really two stories with each having an entirely different tone. About midway through the film, the Jesus version of the 14th Earl is replaced by a Jack the Ripper version. In the process a farcical and relatively light-hearted black comedy is instantly transformed into a much darker story. Black comedy gives way to dark fantasy and hallucinations as the wheels fall off the story until a visually stunning ending.The 1972 theme being essentially that being forced to conform to the ritualistic practices of upper class British society produces a monster. That not being able to do your own thing unleashes a monster on the world. Unfortunately the basic cause and effect of this whole process is glossed over and one is left wondering why the film you have been watching has been replaced with something entirely different and far less entertaining.O'Toole underplays his two characters, don't expect a lot of Gary Oldham type excess. Jesus is more a mild narcissist than a booming holy roller. Jack (the Ripper) is much better mannered but obviously smoldering beneath his polite exterior.The laughs mostly come from the discomfort of Jack's family and from Alastair Sim's apoplectic bishop and Authur Lowe's collectivist butler who abuses the family with a Benson type frankness.There are two great musical sequences, a hunt club performance of Dem Bones (a homage to The Prisoner) and the climatic scene in the House of Lords (a surreal montage of decay to the music of Pomp and Circumstances and Onward, Christian Soldiers).Then again, what do I know?

Her character throws a wrench in the works by falling in love with her new husband. Other than Jack, Seymour's character is the only one that undergoes any real change during the course of the film and she sells this transformation quite nicely while also providing one of the best striptease sequences you are likely to stumble across in a mainstream movie.As already noted the running length is 154 minutes, that's about the length of two movies and if the film were being produced today I suspect that it would be done as two separate films. Indeed it is really two stories with each having an entirely different tone. About midway through the film, the Jesus version of the 14th Earl is replaced by a Jack the Ripper version. In the process a farcical and relatively light-hearted black comedy is instantly transformed into a much darker story. Black comedy gives way to dark fantasy and hallucinations as the wheels fall off the story until a visually stunning ending.The 1972 theme being essentially that being forced to conform to the ritualistic practices of upper class British society produces a monster. That not being able to do your own thing unleashes a monster on the world. Unfortunately the basic cause and effect of this whole process is glossed over and one is left wondering why the film you have been watching has been replaced with something entirely different and far less entertaining.O'Toole underplays his two characters, don't expect a lot of Gary Oldham type excess. Jesus is more a mild narcissist than a booming holy roller. Jack (the Ripper) is much better mannered but obviously smoldering beneath his polite exterior.The laughs mostly come from the discomfort of Jack's family and from Alastair Sim's apoplectic bishop and Authur Lowe's collectivist butler who abuses the family with a Benson type frankness.There are two great musical sequences, a hunt club performance of Dem Bones (a homage to The Prisoner) and the climatic scene in the House of Lords (a surreal montage of decay to the music of Pomp and Circumstances and Onward, Christian Soldiers).Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.

Although this is told from the memories of a now-adult Jean Louise Scout Finch, this movie is multi-dimensional. You see the events from the points of the children, the adults, the victims and the so-called superior whites. It is a stunning and shattering revelation that one group can think itself superior and give little or no thought to those who are inferior. And when one man - Atticus Finch - dares to do just that, he is vilified and literally spit upon by one of the seemingly superior whites, who, in reality, is a lout, a boor and a drunk. Most reviewers have praised the performances of the children and of Gregory Peck and most rightfully so. But to me, the performance that stands out most is that of the gentleman who portrays Rev. Sikes. When he says, Jean Louise! Jean Louise! Stand up ... your father's passing - it is the most riveting scene in the entire movie. No matter how many times I see it, it tears me up inside. Wow! Another riveting scene to me is Brock Peters as Tom Robinson, as he testifies in his own behalf. With tears streaming down his face, he tells what happened at Mayella's house. The pain in his face is palpable. But what I remember about Brock Peters, however, is what he did off screen. At Gregory Peck's funeral, Mr. Peters, who died 2 or 3 years later, praised Mr. Peck for his performance and he thanked the late actor for the privilege it gave him to work on TKAM. That was 40 years after the movie and yet Mr. Peters still praised Mr. Peck. THAT was classy.

Some RomComs are delightful, some are plain boring, and some like this one are thoughtprovoking and often distressing along the way.8 out of 10 because it's a good story, even if some aspects of it made me angry! I was simply disgusted by the TV show scenes. What filth the TV programme was - bringing someone on under completely false pretences. Birdie believes she's on the show for a nice time - a makeover. Now when she discovered it was instead a setup to insult, hurt and degrade her by her nauseatingly immature and spiteful exhibitionist husband and his current equally immature and spiteful lay, why didn't Birdiee slap her repulsive husband and tell the whole TV audience what she thinks of him for playing this dirty trick? And then demand that makeover she was told she was getting or threaten to sue the TV co. for false pretenses? I think they'd then have either had to agree to her demand - or hurriedly hustle all three protagonists off the stage if Birdie kicked up enough of a fuss.But I suppose she'd find that when she agreed to appear on the programme she signed some legal doc and didn't read some fine print that told her she couldn't complain no matter what the outcome. Now if I saw a clause like that in any contract for appearing on TV, no way would I sign and hadn't she ever seen this TV programme before and realised what it was really like?However, for this story to work, she has to have her confidence smashed and be unable to think what to do when faced with her smirking husband and his vicious bit on the side. It's a feature of some Sandra Bullock movies that I have to say I don't often like though sometimes it works well. In this it's debatable. Do we want the movie to show how Birdee recovers her confidence eventually? Or do we want to see her putting up a spirited defence and shaming the gutless berk she married?Wouldn't the TV people receive mail from people backing Birdee against her ex? Why wasn't this passed on to her? Yes, of course she'd be distraught and after an initial outburst become very depressed. And yes, she may well be so shocked at the time she wouldn't know what to say, as is the case in this story, and it's not easy to be so feisty as I suggest she could have been. But I do seriously wonder at the legal situation raised here.Anyway, the story is as it is, one has to forget one's outrage at such disgusting and spiteful TV filth and get on with the story which is the usual kind of sad stuff for those left behind when a husband commits adultery and makes off blithely with his current fancy. It's clear Daddy didn't really care much at all for his kiddie - all he does is phone a few times. What about visits? Tough if it's a long journey. But perhaps one should be grateful he didn't try to visit in case he also tried to snatch the child. Did he pay alimony? Well, Birdie gets a mediocre job and that's quite amusing even if disappointing she can't get anything better in this back of beyond type town - however, she shows that anything can become better if you make something of it yourself.In the end Birdee wins out and things improve for the daughter who after continually standing up for her vile father and thereby hurting her loving and caring mother deeply, finally discovers in the most hurful way what a file b...... her father is. A sad discovery that would surely damage her a little for life, but her mother gets together with an old flame and all turns out happily. Not a film I'd watch again too enthusiastically because one gets so annoyed with the despicable husband and squeeze getting away with everything. But I'd recommend it to anyone who likes Sandra Bullock to see it at least once. As always she acts superbly. spite of that, I am amazed at some of the carping against this movie.

I won't attempt to summarise the plot, just watch the movie and let it pull you in, pretty much the way that Greer's character does to Mitchum.The movie seems to me to rely a little less on the more expressionist exhibitions of noir cinematography, although there is darkness and shadow at key scenes, particularly when Greer kills Mitchum's erstwhile partner, out for his share of the finder's fee and I also enjoyed the car-subjective shot in the very opening scenes, a little reminiscent of Welles' tour-de-force tracking shot at the start of 'Touch of Evil'. From there the typically convoluted plot takes us on Mitchum's travels as he tracks down only to fall irresistibly for gangster's moll Greer, on the run from spurned tough guy Kirk Douglas. The myriad plot developments this time are discernible (not always the case with film noir narratives) and as ever all the loose ends are violently tied up up by the conclusion, taking in a bitter-sweet final vignette just for good measure to allow Mitchum's new girl-friend to let his memory go and get on with her life.The acting is as good as you'd expect, Mitchum the definition of tough laconic-ism, ditto Greer as dangerously beautiful and Douglas as malevolently powerful, with everyone else in support right on the money too. The dialogue is just short of Chandler \/ Hammett standards, but still contains some genre classics, none more so than Mitchum's 'Baby I Don't Care' (taken later as the title of an excellent biography of Mitch's) uttered mid-clinch to Greer as he willingly trips, stumbles and falls for her considerable, but perilous charms.Quite simply, one of the best thrillers to come out of the whole noir era which I heartily recommend.

I was surprised, this movie was ahead of its time and is a huge influence in today's modern cinema. Unlike most monster movies, this one had heart. You felt bad for the creature at the end. King Kong is truly the 8th Wonder of the World. The actors also gave very convincing performances! I highly recommend people to watch this movie! This movie will stand tall for many years to come, and it will be known as the Grandfather of all Epics! Highly recommended, a true classic that will be remembered for decades, even centuries to come! Long live King Kong!

The set-up three gunslingers wander through the war-torn country in search of personal gain.Lee Van Cleef is a hit-man (the Bad), Eli Wallach is a bandit (the Ugly), and Clint Eastwood is a lone gunman with scruples (the Good). Wallach's and Eastwood's stories are intertwined, and they eventually meet up with Van Cleef, although he disappears for long stretches of the film. The saga is long and drawn out and the characters are put through a lot in their quest for riches.But I'm not sure that's what the movie's about. It seems to preach the gruesomeness and pointlessness of war, showing wounded soldiers, some who've lost their legs or arms on the battlefield. The three main characters are just passing through. They have no allegiance and their outsider's point of view helps emphasize the absurdity of all that meaningless killing. I wonder if the gunmen's quest is merely the framework for an anti-war movie...Still, there's plenty of gunslinging action, as well as cannonfire and explosions. This Italian-made western is a pretty big production. The biggest of Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns, yet, following the low-budget Fistful of Dollars and For A Few Dollars More.If Eastwood's man with no name in Leone's Dollar Trilogy is meant to be a single character, this film (the final of the three) shows the birth of that man. This is where he acquires his iconic poncho.As far as westerns go, this isn't the usual John Wayne cowboy fare. If you've seen Leone's earlier westerns, you have an idea of what to expect, except this movie is different even from them. It's not about saloons or cattle trails, cowboys or Indians. It's not even about a ruthless villain that must be stopped. It's about three men all looking out for themselves and all after the same thing. Three men who don't trust each other and who can handle a pistol. The movie is violent, but fun. It takes place across many locations, right in the middle of Civil War action. The war is the backdrop, not the Old West. The whole thing is not quite like any other western film I've seen.IMDb currently rates this as #4 on its Top 250. I don't know if I'd rate it that highly after my first viewing, but it's good. There are many effective stretches with sparse dialogue and the film is full of black humor. There are several memorable sequences. An enjoyable watch. ","genre":null},{"date":"29 December 2009","score":"","review":" The setting the American Southwest (Texas?) during the Civil War.

Basically it is 1943, during World War II, and the United States Navy have established bases in the Solomon Islands, ready to invade New Guinea and the Central Pacific. On one of the island lives French planter Emile De Becque (Rossano Brazzi), who is wanted by the Navy to be a scout to snoop around the Japanese held islands. To make this possible, he is approached by U.S. Navy nurse Ensign Nellie Forbush (Golden Globe nominated Mitzi Gaynor), but is is obvious it's not just his services she is interested in, they slowly fall in love. The other slight love story going on is between Lt. Joseph Cable (John Kerr)and islander Liat (France Nuyen), daughter of philosopher Bloody Mary (Juanita Hall). You also see a musical comedy show as they wait for war to get closer, which is does with some planes bombing nearby, but don't worry, all live happily ever after. Also starring Ray Walston as Luther Billis, Russ Brown as Capt. Brackett, Jack Mullaney as The Professor, Ken Clark as Stewpot, Floyd Simmons as Commander Harbison, Candace Lee as Ngana - Emile's Child, Warren Hsieh as Jerome - Emile's Child, Tom Laughlin as Lt. Buzz Adams and Rebecca's Joan Fontaine as Polynesian Woman. The performances are alright, and there are some good moments of war and romance combines, but personally, I would only see it for the songs, but not bad at all. The songs included There Is Nothing' Like A Dame, Some Enchanted Evening (number 28 on 100 Years, 100 Songs), I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outta My Hair and Happy Talk (remade very well by Captain Sensible). It won the Oscar for Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography and Best Music for Alfred Newman and Ken Darby, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical. It was number 39 on The 100 Greatest Musicals. Good!
