This is the true story of artist Jackson Pollock (Oscar nominated Harris), who towards the end of the 1940's, was trying to find his spark again. He was an expressionist who only painted what he wanted, and had no care for meaning or genre. First he used his brush and painted random lines and shapes, but then he found that he could create much more interesting expression with the brush by dripping the paint onto the canvas. His paintings made a real breakthrough, and he had critic praise, including an article in Life magazine. But old demons were bound to come back, and his wife Lee Krasner (Oscar winning Flubber actress Marcia Gay Harden) had to tolerate his alcoholism, which was ultimately forced her out, and killed him in his fatal car crash, along with one of two women. Also starring Amy Madigan as Peggy Guggenheim, Jennifer Connelly as Ruth Kligman, Jeffrey Tambor as Clem Greenberg, Bud Cort as Howard Putzel, John Heard as Tony Smith, Val Kilmer as Willem DeKooning, Stephanie Seymour as Helen Frankenthaler, Sada Thompson as Stella Pollock, Kenny Scharf as William Baziotes, Barbara Garrick as Betty Parsons and Everett Quinton as James Johnson Sweeney. Harris gives a very convincing portrayal, as well as good directing skills, and Harden does give an Oscar worthy performance as his patiently suffering wife.

Basically, it is filled with two dozen character, living in Nashville, both connected, disconnected and reflecting about both the country-and-western music craze (what Nashville is best known for), and a political debate. What makes this film stand out is not only the fact there is no real story, but the unconventional use of overlapping sounds, especially during dialogue, and the fact that this film is pretty hard to give a genre, because it has many musical, comedy, drama and tragedy. I personally remember this film more for the great music, with songs made apparently by the actors themselves. Starring, in alphabetical order David Arkin as Norman, Barbara Baxley as Lady Pearl, Ned Beatty as Delbert Reese, Karen Black as Connie White; Oscar, BAFTA and twice Golden Globe nominated Ronee Blakley as Barbara Jean, Timothy Brown as Tommy Brown, Keith Carradine as Tom Frank, Golden Globe nominated Geraldine Chaplin as Opal, Robert DoQui as Wade, Shelley Duvall as L.

Generally the killer has a very specific method, and the killings that have taken place since Cole came to LA have seemed a little different to him. And since he's Steven Seagal, of course it needs to be personal. Because like it or not, ole' Steve's just good at revenge, man.The latest murder is Cole's ex-wife and her new husband, so he is brought almost miraculously into a personal involvement in the case (that he came from New York to help find a serial killer and then that killer managed to kill his ex-wife is what I call a Movie Miracle), but luckily his partnership with LA Detective Jim Campbell is interesting an amusing enough to carry us past such small snags.Ad by the way, Campbell is played by Keenan Ivory Wayans who, you may have noticed, is one of the Wayans brothers, but don't let that deter you. He does manage to give a less impressive performance that Seagal in the movie but is leaps and bounds better than his idiot brothers tend to be. At the very least, when he's involved with train wreck movies like White Chicks and Little Man, at least he has the good sense to hide his face.If you ever see Marlon's name anywhere, however, run for the hills!Of course, in The Glimmer Man, Detective Campbell's only role is to make the LAPD seem at first to be the hardcore precinct, and then immediately afterwards he transforms into nothing but comic relief. And not that he's bad at it. It was moderately amusing when he stumbled across powdered deer penis in a Chinese herb store while Taft was at the counter stumbling through some broken Chinese with the store clerks, but I've lived here in China for two years now and I've never seen anyone eat nor have heard anything about anyone eating deer penis, powdered or otherwise.On the other hand, sheep penis is a different story. I've had that myself. It was one of my Chinese friends who explained to me that the Chinese eat everything that runs along the ground except cars, and everything that flies in the sky except airplanes. In fact, by far my favorite late night food (meaning around 4am after a long night of bar-hopping) is barbecued sheep testicles and eyeballs at a location that my friends and I have lovingly dubbed the dirty street. I know it sounds frightening but trust me, those eyeballs are DELICIOUS.Can I just make one suggestion though? If you ever find yourself with the opportunity to eat sparrow, make sure to eat the head first. It's a small bird, so they serve it with everything but the feathers, and you eat everything, too. Claws, bones, beak, everything. But if you save the head for last, like I did, then by the time you bite into the skull you get cold brains squirting into your mouth, and trust me, that's even a little worse than it sounds&#133;So anyway, while tracking the serial killer, it seems that Cole's old boss, played with satisfactory menace by Michael Cox (who you may remember as the movie world's first Hannibal Lecter) is attempting to enter into a shady deal with the Russians to get super-rich off the black market sales of chemical weapons. Needless to say, Cole comes off as a little nuts when he, the new guy, starts trying to convince people that there is a high-level conspiracy going on involving the Russians. Not a good way to make a first impression.There are some good action sequences (if not exactly original) and enough fight scenes to satisfy the Seagal fans (who will admittedly make up most of the audience, except the film critics who warn everyone else away), although it's all made a little goofy by the fact that Lieutenant Cole, at one point, explains that violence is against his religion. Yeah, right.The buddy-cop angle is a clever addition to the Seagal formula and has spotty success here, but the majority of people of course are going to find it a disappointing action movie unless they're a die-hard Seagal fan. Personally, I happen to believe that movies from people like Steven Seagal and Jean Claude Van-Damme speak to a certain adolescent childishness in us that should never really be completely forgotten. No, they're not Oscar winners, nor will they ever be. But if you can't find at least a little fun in some of them, you might think about lightening up a little bit!

His cold-hearted ruthlessness and drive never go over the line into caricature; he is always devastatingly believable, enough to send chills down your spine.Claude Raines, another very fine character actor, gives perhaps the most well-rounded performance in the movie, as a once idealistic politician who has allowed himself to abandon all sense of honesty in the pursuit of personal gratification, only to have his former, almost forgotten self brought back to him by the son of an almost forgotten former friend.

At one point Gaston offers his hand in marriage to Belle,but she rejects and this serves a hard blow to Gaston's ego.While traveling to a fair, Maurice who is Belle's father and an eccentric inventor , becomes lost and loses his horse Phillipe in the night as wolves chase him. Cold and tired, he stumbles upon a mysterious castle and enters it. One by one, the enchanted household items, Lumière the candelabra, Mrs. Potts the teapot and Cogsworth the clock and head of the household warmly welcome him and shelter him from the cold. But a horrifying Beast discovers Maurice and, in a fury, locks him in a dungeon on top of the castle tower. Belle, who worries when Phillipe, returns home without him, decides to seek out her father. Eventually, Belle winds up at the Beast's castle. She finds him at the tower dungeon and tries to break him free, but the Beast catches her instead. She offers herself in exchange for her father's life, against his wishes. The Beast agrees and releases her father.

Prior to watching, I had heard good things about it, and had also been informed, that there was a particularly clever and well-thought out twist awaiting the eager viewer at the end of the film. Sadly, for me, this was not so. Getting the criticism out of the way first, which'll provide me the opportunity to leave this review on a high note... Firstly, starting from the very beginning. I was quite disappointed with the opening. I watched this on Channel4, and stupidly, listening to the pre-film clip featuring a bunch of taxis in New York, I heard the presenter explain that next film is Vanilla Sky, which has one of the best opening sequences in any film. This got me on the edge of my seat, and why not? Television cannot be wrong right? (Apologies for the over-using the sarcasm) The opening sequence was good in what it was meant to be. But i was disappointed in it's choice of song. I'm an avid fan of Radiohead, and Everything In Its Right Place is one of my favourite songs, but for me, the song was unable to compliment the sequence, and the two juxtaposed each other. (However, in a sense, this can be viewed less as a criticism, and more as a praise, as the song itself is about juxtaposition.) Moving swiftly on, and away from the film's opening and going right into the deep end. (Metaphorically speaking, though it's not a particularly good one) The ending featured a twist (Which i shall not give away) which for one, appalled me. It went against everything i was ever taught in primary school. In basic learning! There are many other ways you could have ended the film, whilst retaining it's prominent themes. But this, did not, and i was appallingly disappointed. Now for the bit people love, as lovers of film hate reading criticism of films they like (Hell, do people ever give proper deserved ratings out of 10 any more?) There were positive parts to the film. For one, (Although i wasn't impressed with the choice in the opening scene) The soundtrack for this film is brilliant. Every song chosen (apart from the first one) are brilliant in complimenting the film, and matching to the vivid imagery displayed. I may not be tempted to buy the film, but i am very tempted to buy the soundtrack Another strong praise is actually Tom Cruise, who i take my hat off to, if i wore a hat, which i do, if you count a woolly winter hat as one, but i'm not wearing it now, so i shall only metaphorically take it off. Cruise, who is an actor i have little respect for, shines through in brilliant form in this film. He is supported by a very strong supporting cast of Penelope Cruz and Cameron Diaz, who provide mystery within Cruise's character's life, which for me was poorly summed up. For the people who say Cruise cannot act, this is a prime example of how he 'can' act. Another thing i liked within this film, was a small subtle thing. The references to French New Wave. By law, i'm supposed to hate French New Wave, having been forced to study it in my Film Studies classes, but oddly, i like the films, and it was amusing to spot posters of famous films like Breathless within this film. Last point i shall make, as no doubt, anyone who has had the capacity to read this far is probably bored out of their skull, and is wishing they had strayed over to the message boards to find posts 'not-by-me' (Which sadly, won't work either, as i've been vividly expressing the parts i dislike about this film) The other thing i loved was Mis-En-Scene, which ties in with my last praise for the film. There were some beautiful shots within this film, and although i may not have liked the concept of the ending sequence, i certainly loved the look of it. The beautiful sky, with it's rich colours. It was simply just beautiful to look at.Too sum up my elaborately labelled points which hold absolutely no relevance to anything whatsoever. This film for me, despite having it's good points, is simply average. Yes, i may have loved some parts, but there are a thousand other films which i like for the same reasons, and more! For me, this film just could not live up to it's terrible conclusion, and what might be unfair to describe as, but i'll say it anyway, over-rated beginning. Certainly watch this film, I'm never one to say what you should watch and what you shouldn't. But it's not a film i'll be re-watching in a hurry.

He is supported by a very strong supporting cast of Penelope Cruz and Cameron Diaz, who provide mystery within Cruise's character's life, which for me was poorly summed up. For the people who say Cruise cannot act, this is a prime example of how he 'can' act. Another thing i liked within this film, was a small subtle thing. The references to French New Wave. By law, i'm supposed to hate French New Wave, having been forced to study it in my Film Studies classes, but oddly, i like the films, and it was amusing to spot posters of famous films like Breathless within this film.

There were some beautiful shots within this film, and although i may not have liked the concept of the ending sequence, i certainly loved the look of it. The beautiful sky, with it's rich colours. It was simply just beautiful to look at.Too sum up my elaborately labelled points which hold absolutely no relevance to anything whatsoever. This film for me, despite having it's good points, is simply average. Yes, i may have loved some parts, but there are a thousand other films which i like for the same reasons, and more! For me, this film just could not live up to it's terrible conclusion, and what might be unfair to describe as, but i'll say it anyway, over-rated beginning.

Prior to watching, I had heard good things about it, and had also been informed, that there was a particularly clever and well-thought out twist awaiting the eager viewer at the end of the film. Sadly, for me, this was not so. Getting the criticism out of the way first, which'll provide me the opportunity to leave this review on a high note... Firstly, starting from the very beginning. I was quite disappointed with the opening. I watched this on Channel4, and stupidly, listening to the pre-film clip featuring a bunch of taxis in New York, I heard the presenter explain that next film is Vanilla Sky, which has one of the best opening sequences in any film. This got me on the edge of my seat, and why not? Television cannot be wrong right? (Apologies for the over-using the sarcasm) The opening sequence was good in what it was meant to be. But i was disappointed in it's choice of song. I'm an avid fan of Radiohead, and Everything In Its Right Place is one of my favourite songs, but for me, the song was unable to compliment the sequence, and the two juxtaposed each other. (However, in a sense, this can be viewed less as a criticism, and more as a praise, as the song itself is about juxtaposition.) Moving swiftly on, and away from the film's opening and going right into the deep end. (Metaphorically speaking, though it's not a particularly good one) The ending featured a twist (Which i shall not give away) which for one, appalled me. It went against everything i was ever taught in primary school. In basic learning! There are many other ways you could have ended the film, whilst retaining it's prominent themes. But this, did not, and i was appallingly disappointed. Now for the bit people love, as lovers of film hate reading criticism of films they like (Hell, do people ever give proper deserved ratings out of 10 any more?) There were positive parts to the film. For one, (Although i wasn't impressed with the choice in the opening scene) The soundtrack for this film is brilliant. Every song chosen (apart from the first one) are brilliant in complimenting the film, and matching to the vivid imagery displayed. I may not be tempted to buy the film, but i am very tempted to buy the soundtrack Another strong praise is actually Tom Cruise, who i take my hat off to, if i wore a hat, which i do, if you count a woolly winter hat as one, but i'm not wearing it now, so i shall only metaphorically take it off.

The plot was also very good, on a parallel with the original, but that was the intention, and the music by Bruce Broughton was appropriately fitting.

It was that same stability that most hurt the German film industry, as the Dawes Plan imposed the reduction of all exports, leaving many independent production companies without foreign markets for their product. In the years to come Hollywood would seize this unique financial opportunity to break down its only European rival, but before major box-office flops like Fritz Lang's epic rendition of Die Nibelungen (1924) and Metropolis (1927) and FW Murnau's Faust (1926) would bring UFA to its proverbial knees in debt to German banks, little films like The Last Laugh (1924) and Varieté (1925) were the toast of the town in both sides of the Atlantic.Emil Jannings plays an aging hotel porter who takes great pride and pleasure in his job and especially the lavish uniform that comes with it. In the miserable middle-class neighborhood he lives, being able to wake up in the morning and go to work dressed like in such a prestigious uniform is like being a general. That is until a younger man is hired in his place and he's demoted to the, undignified in his mind, job of lavatory attendant. Not bearing to lose face back home with gossiping neighbors and relatives, the old porter steals back his uniform and returns home as if nothing happened, the uniform a symbol not only of his social status but also of purpose in life.What is most striking about The Last Laugh is the way Murnau externalizes the psychological in a grand, theatric way that could only work on stage and in silent cinema. Watch for example the look of pure anguish and horror in Janning's face when he's asked to turn in his uniform, stripping it off like he's being skinned alive. Recoiling without it into a state of defeat and abandonment like a man stripped of his own identity, with nothing to live for.Obsessed with artistic control and exercising complete authority over the minutest details of lighting and décor, German directors pushed for an increasingly studio-bound cinema to the point that UFA in the years between 1919 and 1927 became the best equipped movie studio in the western world. The Last Laugh is no exception. The facades of apartment blocks in the background with light slanting over them, the low-class neighborhood, the busy street in front of the hotel, all of them replicated in great detail within studio limits. It's within this geography that Murnau transposes Jannings' internal world. As is proper for the inward journey of the self the protagonist faces, the aging porter starts at the busy front of the hotel only to find himself exiled in the dark bowels of the basement where he remains hidden, that is until the film's tacked-on happy ending.The only false note in an otherwise perfect film is the happy ending Murnau and scriptwriter Carl Mayer (of Caligari fame) were forced to devise by UFA executives anxious for the box office success of their movie. It's not that it doesn't work because such a tragic tale precludes a happy ending, after all one of the most memorable endings in all cinema is that of Capra's It's a Wonderful Life and it doesn't get any more saccharine than that, but because it happens in such a tacked-on deus-ex-machina fashion that it feels like a complete cop-out. It's lame now and it was lame then and Murnau no doubt understood that as he flashes a title card (the only title card in the film) more or less apologizing that that's how the movie would've ended if I didn't have a boss to keep happy so here's a they-lived-happily-ever-after epilogue, take it with a pinch of salt or ignore it altogether. It's noteworthy however that it's not pure schmaltzy tripe. It feels as though Murnau is taking a perverse, vulgar pleasure in delivering what was asked of him.Exceptionally photographed, with a modern feel to Murnau's camera-work that places it well ahead of its time compared to other silents, a great example of purely visual storytelling without the cumbersome crutches of the title cards, The Last Laugh stands not only as a triumph of Weimar cinema but as masterpiece almost 100 years later.

Why do I love this movie so much and why do I believe that this is the best movie ever made? Those who are quick to point out it's lack of modern-day sophistication with it's somewhat dated special effects (you know, the type who watch a movie to look for mistakes) have really missed the sweeping grandeur and simple beauty in this movie. Few films are as good at the end of the movie as they are at the beginning. Logan's Run is just the opposite. It only gets better as it goes along. By the end of the film, one can be forgiven for feeling like he or she has experienced something so wonderful and compelling that few of us have ever really experienced in our hard-bitten modern day to day lives. The musical score alone is more than worth the price of admission and that's just one wonderful element of this magical film. But let me tell you why this film is so good First, the story is simply superb. The world has experienced something apocalyptic, whether nuclear or environmental is unknown as it has happened so long ago. The survivors (at least those in this part of the world) have built a large domed city to keep them safe from the outside. In the centuries that followed, people have all but forgotten 'outside'. As Logan says, Outside? There's nothing outside. All they know now is within the domed city. It has become a hedonistic place where every whim is at your fingertips, every pleasure is possible, every desire is fulfilled, nothing is forbidden. But, as the poster for the movie put it, ...there's just one catch.Naturally, being a limited space, population could quickly get out of hand. But the problem has been neatly solved in an unusual way. 30 years is all the life anyone gets. When you hit thirty, it becomes 'Lastday' and your only option is to try like hell for 'renewal' in a fiery ritual known as Carousel. It's something that everyone has been taught to believe can renew a persons life, allowing them to be reborn. But it's really a brutal form of population control. Naturally, as in every society, there are those who question the authorities and decide they'd rather live in the here and now. They decide to break the law and RUN. Some of them believe there is a place called Sanctuary where Runners can live in peace. That's where Logan comes in.Logan is a policeman called a Sandman who has always unquestioningly believed and followed the dictates of the city, as has most everyone else (sound familiar?). As a Sandman, Logan's job is to track down and eliminate Runners. And that's exactly what he happily does until one day when he is told that he must find Sanctuary and destroy it. Without giving away too much more, I'll say that things don't go along as he planned and with his new companion, Jessica, they eventually find there way outside the city into a world that's become an overgrown eden of sorts filled with the decaying ruins of deserted, vine covered cities.The world is unlike anything anyone has seen for hundreds of years and while they're at first shocked by the disorder and wild greenery everywhere, eventually they find there a freedom they could never have understood before. In the decaying ruins of the Capital D.C. they find 'Old Man', marvelously played by Peter Ustinov (the acting by all the principals is another reason to watch this movie), and through him they come to realize that they can live together in peace and grow old.Though they want very much to stay, they finally decide to do the right thing.

Return of the Jedi is the most brilliant of the original three films. It is mind blowing and the best story, battles, creatures and more!! It also ironically is the film that probably has the most memorable and pop culturally significant moments. Right from the beginning you have the world of Tattooine and Jabba The Hut and eventually Princess Leia's infamous gold slave bra and outfit. The object of every teenage boys fantasy in the eighties. Yoda's touching death and Luke's full circle training as a Jedi. The intense and special effect driven escape from Jabba The Hut with Han Solo and the incredible final showdown between Luke and his father Darth Vader while an incredible battle rages on Endor with the adorably creepy Ewoks. All of this is packed into the third installment and it is truly a spectacle to see. Considering the film picks up exactly where Empire Strikes Back ends you really need to watch all three films but this one installment makes the entire original series worth while. Return of the Jedi is by far the best!!The entire original cast returns as well as the new characters picked up from Empire Strikes back. I would love to go into detail of the entire cast but I can only break it down slightly. Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher are still brilliant feisty heroes and their romance comes to full fruition. Mark Hamill definitely gets the biggest character arc as he becomes full on hero from his original rather naive young Skywalker in the first film. While Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker and Peter Mayhew return to their infamous sidekick roles they don't change much from the previous films but there is nothing wrong with that by any means. They are great characters and fun to watch and there is no reason to change them. David Prowse and James Earl Jones reprise the best villain in movie history as Darth Vader who has also come full circle in his character and the final battle between him and Luke with the Emperor goading them on is just awesome...worth watching just on it's own.As good as the original cast is returning in this film the true brilliance of it is the masterful special effects. Jabba The Hut and his entire world around him, the Ewoks and their world and the incredible battles that happen, can all be mostly attributed to the brilliant creations of George Lucas and director Richard Marquand. Marquand actually appears to be a mostly new director but he handles this project like a complete pro and probably set him for life. However you feel about the Star Wars Universe you can't help but respect the original films and how they progressively got better. Return of The Jedi stands alone as being an absolutely brilliant film in story, characters and special effects.

They are great characters and fun to watch and there is no reason to change them. David Prowse and James Earl Jones reprise the best villain in movie history as Darth Vader who has also come full circle in his character and the final battle between him and Luke with the Emperor goading them on is just awesome...worth watching just on it's own.As good as the original cast is returning in this film the true brilliance of it is the masterful special effects. Jabba The Hut and his entire world around him, the Ewoks and their world and the incredible battles that happen, can all be mostly attributed to the brilliant creations of George Lucas and director Richard Marquand. Marquand actually appears to be a mostly new director but he handles this project like a complete pro and probably set him for life. However you feel about the Star Wars Universe you can't help but respect the original films and how they progressively got better. Return of The Jedi stands alone as being an absolutely brilliant film in story, characters and special effects. One of my favorite films hands down. 10\/10 ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"},{"date":"27 February 2009","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" If you watch all three of the original Star Wars films, by the time you reach the end of Star Wars Return of The Jedi your jaw will be on the floor and you will be forever a fan of the Star Wars universe. Return of the Jedi is the most brilliant of the original three films. It is mind blowing and the best story, battles, creatures and more!! It also ironically is the film that probably has the most memorable and pop culturally significant moments. Right from the beginning you have the world of Tattooine and Jabba The Hut and eventually Princess Leia's infamous gold slave bra and outfit. The object of every teenage boys fantasy in the eighties. Yoda's touching death and Luke's full circle training as a Jedi. The intense and special effect driven escape from Jabba The Hut with Han Solo and the incredible final showdown between Luke and his father Darth Vader while an incredible battle rages on Endor with the adorably creepy Ewoks. All of this is packed into the third installment and it is truly a spectacle to see. Considering the film picks up exactly where Empire Strikes Back ends you really need to watch all three films but this one installment makes the entire original series worth while. Return of the Jedi is by far the best!!The entire original cast returns as well as the new characters picked up from Empire Strikes back. I would love to go into detail of the entire cast but I can only break it down slightly. Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher are still brilliant feisty heroes and their romance comes to full fruition.

I can't find any part of this movie that I don't like. I don't understand the negative reviews. Yes, this is a kids movie.I'm 18 years old now and that would be prime age to hate a kids movie, yet I love it as much as I did as a youngster.This is a unique take on the Peter Pan story and it proposes an interesting question; What if Peter Pan grew up? From there the movie takes you on a great mystical adventure in Neverland of Peter Pan re-finding himself and his youthful spirit, remembering his past, and rescuing his kids from the sinister Captain Hook. It is a wonderful story.The casting of Robin Williams and Dustin Hoffman was great. Bob Hoskins is perfect for the role of Hook's right hand man Smee. John Williams of course conducts a masterful score. The child actors play their part very well. Steven Spielberg made this movie people, I don't see why you need to compare this movie's success to say 'Jaws' or 'ET'. Because Spielberg makes many great movies I understand that he has set a standard for himself, but just because this movie wasn't groundbreaking doesn't make it bad. It is a great movie in my opinion.This is my favorite movie of all time. I give it 10\/10 without any reservations.

Julie Andrews is more than splendid as the nanny, and I absolutely love her voice. Dick Van Dyke, despite the accent, should have gotten an award for his performance for sheer energy and enthusiasm, but I liked him marginally better in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. David Tomblinson is a blast as the father, as are the children. There is solid support also from the likes of Glynnis Johns, Hermione Baddely and Elsa Lanchester. (who I believe was Charles Laughton's wife) Plus Ed Wynn in a hilarious characterisation as Uncle Albert. The songs and choreography are what makes so timeless, as well as the outstanding animated sequences. One of my favourite scenes was the one on the ceiling, with the terrible jokes, but you couldn't help laughing at the ridiculousness of it all. In contrast Mr Banks walking to his financial doom ties with Feed the Birds as the most moving scene of the film. It also teaches some nice family values as well. I highly recommend this film. 10\/10, without a shadow of a doubt.
