This movie, though, really made me want to write something. I saw this movie more than a month ago, now that I think about it. Anyway, I'll just cut to the chase. There will be some spoilers and I will reveal who the killer(s) so read with caution or don't read until you have seen the movie. I guess I can start with the plot. More of the same, with Sidney being stalked once again by a messed up psycho. I was sad to find out that she plays a small role in this. She was the main character in the first two but now she is just alone and isolated. Well, who could blame her after all that's happened to her? She lives in a house deep in the woods. She still talks to friends and family but keeps a low profile. She works for a crisis hotline. Good job, I guess. Well, killings start to happen on the set of Stab 3 Return to Woodsboro and Sidney gets thrown into the mix by a nosey detective played by Patrick Dempsey. Call me corny, but I actually liked the idea of bringing in an old 80's teen star. He did a good job and really confused me about him being the killer. I just suspected him all the way but was surprised when he turned out to be a good guy. Dewey and Gale have drifted apart and don't really like each other as much as they used to but still have a thing for each other. Dewey is working on the set of Stab 3 and is no longer a police deputy. Gale is not really a news reporter but sort of a talkshow host-type person. Killings mostly happen to the cast of Stab 3 and people who have something to do with the movie. I thought it was really scary and made me jump a lot of times. I thought it was funny but didn't have the edge Kevin Williamson gave it and I miss him in this one. Well, Sidney shows up for the climax which, I must say, was good but didn't live up to my expectations for the third and, supposedly, last chapter in the trilogy. The killer turns out to be her long, lost brother but he is known through the movie as the director of Stab 3, Roman Bridger. I found that to be a little odd. He wasn't much older than Sidney but said that he was sort of kicked out of the house and some how Sidney didn't even know she had a brother. Like her parents wouldn't have told her she had a brother who was born around the same time as her?!? I really wish there would've been two killers, though. Well, it was a nice twist but all that stuff about 'all bets off' was just to get people excited because they thought Sidney might actually die. She lives and I'm glad she did but it might have been good to step up all the hype by just killing Gale or Dewey or even both. It is pretty violent, though. It was way more bloody than the first two.  I still liked it but was expecting a bit more from the greatest horror series ever made. It was very thrilling and had lots of action, laughs, and, of course, screams and I liked the script but I think it would've been better if it had been written by Kevin Williamson. He made the horror genre better with this trilogy. Speaking of trilogies, I didn't really like the fact that the door was left open for another sequel. I thought they said it was the last, didn't they? Oh well, as long as the fourth is good, go ahead and make it but if it sucks, it just goes to show you, Hollywood will do anything for a buck.

Running time 90 minutes. Rated PG-13. (for sexuality, nudity, and sci-fi violence)What a bad position for the film industry to start out the new year with. Supernova may just be the year's worst film--and it's only January. There is such little intelligence, characterization and structure existent. I was never intrigued, but daydreaming throughout the entire production's running time. This is a complete waste of time--a true walk out.Supernova is a movie in which there is almost no story, only briefly related concepts sloppily quilted together with imagination-deadening special effects and action sequences. What plot there is centers around a space vessel on a mission to recover a distress call. The crew consists of Nick Vanzant (James Spader), Kaela Evers (Angela Bassett), Yerzy Penalosa (Lou Diamond Phillips), Danika Lund (Robin Tunney), A.J. Marley (Robert Forster) and Benjamin Sotomejor (Wilson Cruz). They become endangered species when a mysterious man named Troy Larson (Peter Facinelli) is recruited on board in reference to the rescue mission. He also brings a bright extraterrestrial object with him, one that not only disguise his identity, but also retransforms his body with youth.Shall we count the ways Supernova  recycles its plot?1.  The method the filmmakers choose to execute the villain's defense, which consists of self healing power and eternal youth. This concept is from the visually arousing Terminator 2 Judgment Day.2.  The movie's crew is stranded aboard a large ship in the presence of some kind of extraterrestrial object that beholds great powers. Remember the circular power source in Sphere?3.  In 1998's Star Trek Insurrection, a mysterious race on an isolated planet withholds the power of eternal youth. That vary idea is present in this piece of garbage.4.  Event Horizon contained a possessed human as the villain, who gradually eliminated the crew members of a massive deserted space craft containing an unknown object. Exactly like the antagonist and space ship of Supernova.I could barely understand anything that was going on in the story, and what I did understand bored me. The entire plot is strained out of nothing. There is no explanation of why certain events and motives take place, or what the extraterrestrial object's purpose is. When we do finally receive an explanation of what is happening, which is well into the second half, it is already too late for the film to achieve anything with its material. We needed introduction near the beginning, not half way through.Supernova inherits no introduction of its characters, motives, intentions, or situations. Nor does it bother to develop any of the above. The most maturation we get of a character is a brief line of dialogue explaining one's social position. Because of this horrible misfortune the filmmakers precede in, I despised the characters here. Each is immoral, and or nasty in their own way, thus much of the time, I was rooting for the bad guy to attack some interest for us. However, instead of giving us with a variety of gruesome encounters between Troy and the other crew members, we acquire several brief, lifeless assaults that lack so much passion it is a shame I gave the antagonist any hope in the first place.There is a lot of sexual content in this film, enough to give the PG-13 rating a serious run for its money. The sensual scenes have no impact, though, because no romantic chemistry is present. There is a difference between love and sex. Like the tagline to Chasing Amy states, Sex it easy, love is hard, the writers of Supernova forget attempting the difficulties of developing a chemistry rich relationship between anyone in the movie. Although there was some believability with the characters of Lou Diamond Phillips and Robin Tunney. For the most part, however, the writers provide us with muscular, shirtless males, tight fitted, when clothed, females, and sexual encounters that only lead the immorality destruction of the characters.I am a little flabbergasted to see so many names listed in the film's cast list. Such actors as James Spader, Angela Bassett, Lou Diamond Phillips, Robin Tunney, and Robert Forster, who are all capable of better performances than what they have contributed in this disaster of a science fiction flick. Even these popular performers can't elevate beyond the indecisive dialogue and self destructive plot provided for them.According to my sources, the director of Supernova isn't a man named Thomas Lee, but several higher ranked directors who have enlisted themselves behind a false identity. I will not reveal who these veterans are. I understand their concerns for their futures as directors.

I was afraid the ideas might come across as too cheesy, but it has such a strong and talented cast that seeing how they treated these ideas appealed to me, and in the end, it was the cast and the effects that made the movie.I walked out of the theatre thinking, It's been done before, but I am glad I saw it. The special effects are gorgeous - but almost too perfect.  Life & death action just does NOT seem to pack the same punch when it is done in the slow motion world of zero gravity.

However, the same slower speed that created these problems also allows us time to truly feel and reflect on the emotions of loss & love, which are both deeply felt here.If you are looking for action and a movie that will hold glued to your seat and sweep you away, look elsewhere. But if you want characters with depth and ideas that will still leave you thinking hours after the movie, check this one out. The special effects are well worth seeing on their own and this is definitely a movie with something for everyone - even women who are not at all into Science Fiction will *love* the zero gravity dance scene and be touched by the relationships.BTW--- is it just me, or was the evolution sequence almost exactly a fully developed version of the first section of one that was originally cut from the movie, _Heavy Metal_?

Mystery Men takes its place  among the classic comic-strip spoofs on TV like  Batman and Captain Nice and cartoons like  Underdog and Super Chicken.  The same spirit  lives in all of them  the comic tongue-in-cheek  tone; the courage to aim for the heroic in life at  the risk of looking ridiculous; the  not-so-sure-footed way that these characters manage  to prevail over their adversaries.  It's the  misfired spark of nobility igniting in the weak and  the ordinary, and it's wonderful to see it glow so  high and bright here.Mystery Men opens on a party at a nursing home.  I  wish Kinka Usher had had the sense to give more  energy and life to the old people in the scene.  As  it is, it looks like something George Romero might  have devised.  We need to get the feeling that these  old people are as sharp as everyone else, or it  feels patronizing.  By the time the Red Eyes crash  the festivities, you half expect Tom Waits who plays  a weapons inventor with a penchant for ladies in  their eighties to stand up and shout  Just what  this party needs--a little excitement!  If writer  Neil Cuthbert had any sense, he would have had Waits  mixing it up with the intruders and egging on the  partiers to do the same.  It would have made for a  rousing beginning, and a better introduction of the  troublesome trio the Shoveler (William Macy); the  Blue Raja (Hank Azaria); and Mr. Furious (Ben  Stiller), who seem to come out of nowhere to save  the day. There are many other problems to Mystery Men than  I care to go into; among them that the villain  Casanova Frankenstein needs to have as cultivated a  sense of the absurd as the rest of the people in  this movie, and he doesn't.  Geoffrey Rush is the  wrong actor for the part; he needs to be way over  the top to make the conflict between good and evil a  galvanic one.  And Rush has never exhibited a talent  for the outre.  You hope for the ripe theatrics of a  John Lithgow in The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai  or the dry, debonair diffidence of a Paul Freeman  in Raiders of the Lost Ark.  Instead what we get  is pastiche; something half-baked and not fully  realized.There are too many ideas running through Mystery  Men for anyone to tie them neatly together, and  that may be its deepest problem.  But whatever kind  of a mess it is is the kind of mess I love.  Ben  Stiller has always seemed to be slumming in the  roles he takes.  This one is no exception, but he  goes at it with such conviction that you come away  feeling that he'd learned something about comedy  growing up in a household run by Jerry Stiller and  Anne Meara.  His Roy is related to all the put-upon,  overly sensitive, chronically defensive types that  Woody Allen made popular.  And whether it's  wheedling his way into the affections of the  waitress at his favorite hangout (the sleek Claire  Forslani), or questioning the wisdom of a fellow  superhero (Wes Studi as the Sphinx), or giving a new  member of their elite group (Jeaneane Garofalo in  what are possibly her funniest moments on screen) a  hard time, he makes it always fun to watch.  I  couldn't exactly say that about him in There's  Something About Mary.Jeaneane Garofalo proves with this performance that  she should have been the star of One True Thing,  not Renee Zellweger.  I don't think I have ever seen  funnier exchanges between a daughter and father  (okay, so he's dead and his skull is in a bowling  ball, so sue me) in the movies.  And the funny part  about this role is that it feels like a screwball  reprise of Emily Watson's spellbinding talks with  God in Breaking the Waves.  And in this version,  the girl doesn't die, and bells don't ring in your  head.William H. Macy does something very difficult; he  makes stolid magnetic.  You understand right away  what's attracted Jenifer Lewis' Lucille to Eddie.  You can also understand her exasperation.  The barbecue alone would be enough to drive me over the edge, but when Eddie's adorable, half-breed son looks up at his father and says I believe in you, Daddy. to which Lucille sighs and exclaims, Roland, don't encourage your father, you feel like standing and hailing Neil Cuthbert as a first-rate wit. With Hank Azaria (whose only moment of note in film up to this point was his bare behind in The Birdcage) and Louise Lasser (Has it been more than two decades since we first took note of her in Bananas and Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman?) as son and mother who share a fondness for silverware; Greg Kinnear as Captain Amazing and Ricky Jay as his publicist; Kel Mitchell as Invisible Boy; Paul Reubens as The Spleen; and Lena Olin who, if she didn't have the few lines in this movie that she has, would seem to be visiting the set.

I've seen great movies (Citizen Kane, the Graduate, Taxi Driver, Clockwork Orange, Silence of the Lambs, etc.) and this movie definitely ranks up with the big boys. First of all, the acting was superb. Kevin Spacey is brilliant and we see some of the insanity in his character that we saw in SEVEN. Annette Benning is easy to hate but at the same time you feel so sorry for her. Every actor in this movie delivered. The cinematography was wonderful as well. It had a film-noir look at times. I loved the rose petals and the other symbolism.   With that said, this was an unbelievably well written movie. There were so many twists and turns. You were on the edge of you seat even though we all knew the main character was going to die because he told us so in the first minute of the film. Having a dead character as the narrator is quite original as well. I loved this movie more and more as it went on. Almost every character is despicable but yet it is easy to sympathize with each. Even the horrible marine officer neighbor is a truly woeful character.   This movie is so great because it is not the typical movie. It does not have a happy ending nor any truly happy moments. It carries a resounding message that things are not as they seem and people suffer. Yet at the same time it shows that beauty can shine through ugliness. I was speechless after this movie! Go see it on the big screen while you have the chance! It deserves all the numerous Oscars that it's nominated for!!! A masterpiece!

Written by Leslie Dixon and Kurt Wimmer. Running time 113 minutes. Rated R (for sexuality, nudity, and some language).\tThe Thomas Crown Affair is a production of clever writing and sly, unconventional twists, with a sneaky and lightweight plot. It begins on a positive note through style, high stakes and crucial events, and concludes with some of the same kind of material. The only flaws in the production are a lot of flat dialogue, a slow moving, non-progressive second act, and unnecessary scenes that only distract us from the true theme of action. If not for these problems, we would have had one heck of a mystery thriller that may have played with our minds like a curious cat with a spool of string. \tThe movie begins with a rich sense of visual action and enticement. The Metropolitan Museum of Art is the setting, where a filthy rich individual named Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan) burglarizes the building of a Monet worth over one hundred million dollars. Within this first rate setup, the producers grant us several twists and turns, unexpected occurrences, but little character development. The official assigned to this complicated case is Michael McCann (Denis Leary), who teams up with an insurance investigator named Catherine Banning (Rene Russo). When Catherine meets Thomas at a banquette, her skepticism arises about this man, who has nearly everything money can accommodate. However, Crown has devised a foul proof heist with the Monet, and it will be very difficult for anyone to prove he committed the crime. Although conviction is not her main goal, she attempts to seduce her way inside the Crown mansion to examine the artifacts there, and possibly convince the thief to return the painting so that her company doesn't have to write an enormous check. \tCrown and Banning become closer. She becomes more suspicious. He teases her with clues and temptations along their cat and mouse chase. Eventually, he takes her to his resort in the tropics where they exchange outcomes and gather information about each other. Complications ensue when she suspects Tom to have another mistress, and she reluctantly becomes overly involved in his status, and is forced to choose between the life of an insurance investigator or Thomas Crown's partner. \tA lot of the second act includes wasted time through scene after scene consisting of cat and mouse-like material. These wondering sequences do develop chemistry, but really do not move the story forward. There are also segments that clarify Thomas Crown's motives, treating us like slowwitted dummies, through intercut visits with an unclassified psychiatrist (Faye Dunaway). Naturally, these demonstrations are meaningless, and contribute nothing to the story.The casting is perfect, eminently with Pierce Brosnan as the title character, who performs with elegance and style. He presents his character with firm knowledge of the script and scenarios. Rene Russo is also devilishly clever, handling her role with glamorous style, and charming intimacy. Surprisingly overlooked here is Denis Leary's character. He doesn't induce much intrigue here because he is a puppet of the plot.The Thomas Crown Affair may embody style and allure, but  much of the dialogue is flat. Many of the conversations only restate what is already obvious, thus obtain in a dreary, dual fashion.  Although, aside from the unsuccessful soundtrack, I did enjoy a lot of the movie's éclat, it did have somewhat of a smarty pants tone throughout. It is almost if the film thinks it is better than it actually is. The film is directed by John McTiernan, whose most famous credits include Medicine Man (1992), The Hunt for Red October (1990), Last Action Hero (1993), two of the Die Hard films, and the more recent The 13th Warrior. Coming from a mostly belligerent individual, I was expecting something more action packed with Crown. Instead we receive more romantic chemistry than action, and more intellect than injury.  Whereas The Thomas Crown Affair is not a remarkable movie, I even struggle to recommend it, I still enjoyed enough of the overall presentation to call it good.

Right off the bat, this is an unlikely scenario, because astronauts are normally quarantined for a period of time before a mission. Plus, staying up late and drinking on the night before setting off on a major (or any) space flight is just plain stupid.Fast-forward 13 months. The first Mars mission has landed successfully and has been on the surface for seven months already. Huh? How about throwing in a scene of this historic landing? Isn't some dramatization of the first person to step foot on Mars (who happens to be African American) worth a minute of film? Plus, I would expect a celebration on Earth for this event. Well, at least I would have liked to have seen this.On the Mars surface, while exploring a strange mountain, a storm develops suddenly and a weird funnel cloud forms out of this mountain and soon envelops the astronauts. I say soon envelops rather than immediately envelops because the astronauts just stand there, for way too long, watching this strange bending and twisting tornado come toward them. The realistic reaction would be to RETREAT and get the hell out of there at once, but, defying all logic, they just stand there and gape at it. This results in the deaths (one rather gruesome) of all but one of the astronauts. Maybe their deaths were a reward for their idiocy.When a garbled message from the surviving astronaut, is received at the space station orbiting Earth and a rescue mission is hastily formed by what seems like just a handful of people rather than a gung-ho team experience like in Apollo 13. Again, a feeling of small scale production.In the final scenes where the astronauts view an elaborate presentation of the last days of Mars' civilization as well as the origins of life on Earth and are hand in hand standing in a circle, I expected either Sister Sledge's We are Family or the Coca Cola classic I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing to start piping up on the soundtrack.

Also, Gary Sinise needs to work on his smile... it comes across as a sneer. At times, Sinise looks uncomfortable and in his role. The plot? A rather simple one with hardly any surprises. The sets and hardware were realistic and done well. Again, it seemed like this whole movie just involved a small group of people, a limited cast and settings perhaps to keep the focus on the point of the film. Was it worth seeing? Overall, yes, but unless you are a big science fiction fan, I would recommend seeing it on video since (yes, I'll say it once again) it does have the feeling of a small scale production and although it looked great, but not outstanding, it's not really spectacular on the big screen.

Other movies are destroyed by an overkill ratio of effects to story and style. What most movies don't have is atmosphere and life. It's hard to point at exactly why, but after watching this movie I felt it had both. First of all, many critics have and will attack this movie on the basis of its length. I've never felt this was a valid criticism personally, and in this movie I think it was necessary to transform a simple detective tale into the dark and somewhat confusing story it finishes as. The movie moves slowly, but the sights and sounds along the way add momentum to the overall feel. Nevertheless, those requiring frequent stimulation doubtlessly will be annoyed with all of this. Secondly, much criticism has been devoted to certain cliche areas of the movie such as the black-robed coven and the sex scene by firelight. I think there was a bit of humor in both...however it didn't detract anything to me. At the point of the sex scene, most observant viewers will have likely drawn conclusions to the nature of Mrs. Seigner's character...it merely struck me as simple symbolism of Dean Corso's coupling with evil.

Other movies are destroyed by an overkill ratio of effects to story and style. What most movies don't have is atmosphere and life. It's hard to point at exactly why, but after watching this movie I felt it had both. First of all, many critics have and will attack this movie on the basis of its length. I've never felt this was a valid criticism personally, and in this movie I think it was necessary to transform a simple detective tale into the dark and somewhat confusing story it finishes as. The movie moves slowly, but the sights and sounds along the way add momentum to the overall feel. Nevertheless, those requiring frequent stimulation doubtlessly will be annoyed with all of this. Secondly, much criticism has been devoted to certain cliche areas of the movie such as the black-robed coven and the sex scene by firelight. I think there was a bit of humor in both...however it didn't detract anything to me. At the point of the sex scene, most observant viewers will have likely drawn conclusions to the nature of Mrs. Seigner's character...it merely struck me as simple symbolism of Dean Corso's coupling with evil. Somewhat hokey perhaps, but intended. The movie never gave me the impression of seriousness; it is a fantasy piece after all. And finally, that the movie strays away from the religious I felt wise. The movie wasn't really about religion. It was about humanity and the darkness within...and overall, it was something of a ghost story type...like The Omen movies. If it had become bogged down in religious issues of good and evil, it would have become another boring story that has been done over and over again. (Read...Stigmata perhaps?)Overall, I felt the movie had a dark, yet fun feel to it. The visuals are outstanding. The acting is terrific. The music is well done. (Give me a break on the cliche music bit. James Horner made a career on it) If you're looking for some deep message here, avoid this. If you're attention span clocks out at an hour and a half, avoid this. If you're looking for a movie with a dark, mysterious life of its own give this one a look. I give it a nine of ten.

There was a lot of humorous moments and the whole theater was laughing throughout the film.I personally like Julia Roberts and I would probably go see her in anything.  This movie is probably going to be one of my favorites.  My husband and I are very justice issues-oriented people.  We like to see the little man win.  I grew up in the Sacramento Valley where PG&E serviced us as our electric company, and I was horrified to learn that they would do such a thing to a small community.  We could have been one of the families hurt by this company's negligence!  I had taped the Oprah Winfrey segment that featured Julia Roberts, the real Erin Brockovich and Ed Masry.  My husband and I watched it when we got home from the movie.  Erin and Ed Masry both said the movie was pretty true to the real story.  I like how quirky life is, and how destiny works -- Erin, a single mom with 3 small children to raise, finds herself victim of a car accident that changes her life completely.  She goes to Ed Masry to represent her in a lawsuit, they lose the case and she is without anything -- no job, no money, wrecked car and desperate.  Indignant that Ed told her she would win no problem, she goes back and demands a job from him.  As you will find in the movie, Erin Brockovich is a hard woman to say no to.  I don't think anyone would have a chance if they tried.  Julia Roberts portrayed her character extremely well -- with heart, intense passion and conviction. It's a wonderful story about someone who doesn't let fear get in the way of doing the right thing. As far as the clothing -- you have to remember that Erin Brockovich was Miss Wichita (? I think she said) and her whole sense of who she was prior to going to work for Ed Masry revolved around her appearance.  Those clothes were very much the 80s, and she was comfortable enough with her body and sexuality to wear them.  The real Erin is a beautiful woman.  According to the real Erin, her skirts were even shorter than the ones Julia Roberts wore in the movie!Go see it.  It might make you think twice about doing nothing next time you see someone being victimized.  Besides, like one of the other comments about this movie said -- you want to just see what is going to come out of her mouth next!  This movie made me want to meet the real Erin.  I love people who have no fear, and aren't afraid to stand up for what they believe is right.  This is a gutsy movie about a gutsy woman!

That brings me to the actors the supporting actors -among them Christopher Plummer and Philip Baker Hall (also to be seen in The Talented Mr. Ripley and Magnolia) - are all very good and Al Pacino does a good job as Lowell Bergman, but the one who beats them all is Russell Crowe as Jeffrey Wigand. Crowe (who was already great in L.A.Confidential) is simply outstanding! I honestly think that Russell Crowe should get the oscar and not Kevin Spacey (well, Spacey is great in American Beauty, but he already got an academy award for The Usual Suspects).  To me The Insider is just a perfect film and I already consider it as one of my alltime favourites. It is a real gem, flawless, essential. The very best film of the year. A well deserved 10! Can't wait to get on it DVD.

I was prepared for the worst. At least I knew I'd get to look at Christina Ricci. But this movie surprised me and left me with a sense of fulfillment for having watched it. I did not waste my time after all!The story takes place on New Year's Eve 1981 and incorporates 3 storylines into one. All the characters are tied together in one way or another and the movie centralizes around the New Year's Eve party and a woman's apartment (which no one shows up at until she's drunk and passed out).This tale of sex, booze, and cigarettes showed the ridiculousness of these things and made us laugh at the same time. Despite the party being the central theme of the movie...we do not get to see it at all. This leaves a lot to the imagination. The movie was shot so that it alternated between characters and storylines but intertwined them beautifully. Every member of the star studded cast put in a great performance and this movie was truly well done. I enjoyed it very much and give it a 9 out of 10. If you're not offended easily...go out and rent this movie today!

I suppose that imagining that I was Nordic and lopping off English heads was preferable to being a cowboy and picking on the hapless Red Indians.\tThe likes of Kirk Douglas, Tony Curtis, Ernest Borgnine, Frank Thring and Janet Leigh in movies like The Vikings (1958) made for pretty good childhood fantasies and I reckon that sometimes it's O.K. not to grow up.\tIn The 13th Warrior Jose Antonio Dominguez Banderas stars as Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan. Other characters include Herger The Joyous, Buliwyf (perhaps he was the red headed one with the Scottish accent), Melchisidek (Omar Sharif in a cameo) and Queen Weilew who was played by the less glamourously named Diane Venora.\tDon't worry too much about her though. She's just there to pat Ibn's brow, and other things belonging to Ibn, between battles.\tBut those names do have a certain broad sword ring to them don't they.\tThe idea is that Arab poet Ibn (Banderas) has been lusting after the wrong woman in Court and has been sent off as some sort of diplomat to the Vikings who have a spot of bother. \t A village is being besieged by mad demons. 13 warriors must go and Banderas must help out. \tAnd so the carnage begins.
