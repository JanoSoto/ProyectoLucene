For a movie to do that, it has to be very good, and I applaud Scream for its ability to do so (though I'm getting kind of tired of the style it created for a few reasons which I will list here).Scream is your standard slasher movie, albeit with a few major differences. First and foremost, it is a curious mix of scares and comedy, which I will get to later. Second, unlike most slasher movies, it's pretty smart. The characters do dumb things, but they talk smart, and the fact that they still do dumb things makes it pretty funny sometimes. Finally, it's well done. It all seems very fresh and nothing is sloppy or hammed up. Very welcoming.The plot is standard, but given the purpose of the movie, that's what it should be. It's a slasher movie that pokes fun at itself and the earlier entries into the genre, so it's only natural that it takes this route. Basically, a costumed psychopath is stalking and brutally murdering local teenagers (after they drink or have sex, and\/or do stupid things...again, part of the joke). But it centers around one local teen, Sydney Prescott (Neve Campbell) who is of course, not without a dark past.That's pretty much it. Sound familiar? It should. Again, that's the point. But what rises it above the level (significantly) is that it knows what it's doing, and isn't trying to hide it (therefore not assuming its target audience is dumber than the characters that inhabit the worst entries into the genre). The characters are actually pretty intelligent (thanks to the smart script and the solid acting across the board), and even know the rules of the slasher movies, and of course the people who laugh at the warnings die gruesome deaths by making the mistakes that they were warned about (again, it's being funny and scary at the same time).Now about that purpose I was talking about, the fact that it's aiming for both laughs and scares, sometimes at the same time. It's certainly ambitious, which is rare for a big studio, and unheard of for a horror movie, especially a slasher movie. However, I have to admit, it doesn't work like it's supposed to. The laughs dilute the scares for the most part (though there are a good few creepy moments). The beginning scene with Drew Barrymore, is excellent, though not very scary. Still, it's commendable for how well it's done. I admit that I didn't see the final twist coming, which is kind of surprising (and probably should be rather embarrassing) since it was probably meant to lampoon the feeble attempts of the same obligatory task that was made by its predecessors. Then again, movies like Scream are typically not my kind of movie. But it's a modern classic of sorts (as close to it as a mainstream movie will come), so I had to check it out.While it doesn't work like it's supposed to, that doesn't mean it's a waste of time, not by a long shot. Scream may not be the best horror movie, but it's undeniably engaging, and never boring. I was always involved in the movie, and its interesting tone helps a lot. It's a fun movie, in a way, but it still manages to be pretty dark and grim. The recognition for that goes to Wes Craven, rightly known as one of the masters of the genre. He puts a lot of effort into the movie, and it shows. His goal is clearly not to have the most brutal deaths and the most sex, booze and gore he can cram into a single movie (though there are significant amounts of all of them and then some). He loves what he's doing, and wants to make it the best he can, and for his part, he does the best that can be done with the material. The new mixture of laughs and scares not working is not his fault, it's the concept that doesn't work. That statement is proved by all the future horror flicks that try to use the same method, which has long worn out it's welcome (even though it never really came).The acting isn't that important, as it's not that kind of movie (slasher movies aren't supposed to be). That said, all the acting is believable, and serves the film's purpose solidly.Writer Kevin Williamson is clearly very talented, especially since this was his first script. He is an idea man (something that is almost extinct in mainstream Hollywood), and he has about as much know-how and as strong of a love for the slasher movie as Craven himself.Speaking of, Wes Craven deserves most of the credit for pulling this movie together. Again, this movie doesn't quite work like the filmmakers had perhaps hoped, but it could have been a complete mess. Applause goes to Craven for preventing that. Actually, he makes it work well enough that almost none of the horror movies these days aim for just scares, which is kind of a shame now, because after 11 years, I kind of miss those movies.Do I recommend it? Sure, just know what you're going into. If you're going into it expecting a pure scarefest like Halloween, you're probably going to be disappointed because that's not what Scream offers. It's a slasher movie that offers a commentary on itself. Now that's something you don't see every day.

Most modern horror movies fit into this category.Then there are those movies that don't simply cause the tension and adrenaline to pump through your veins harder than usual. They actually frighten you to a level that you've never experienced.Halloween is such a film. It takes so many risks that would make most movie producers cringe. But nearly all of them work. Halloween is awe-inspiring in its simplicity, and terrifying as a whole.The story is simple. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is babysitting some kids on Halloween night, while a madman is on the loose after escaping from a mental institution after brutally murdering his older sister 15 years ago. Of course, the madman, later known as Michael Myers, begins killing the local teenage population, and eventually he comes after Laurie.Sounds familiar, right? Just another brainless slasher filled with dumb teenagers and gobs of gore. Not a chance.I think James Berardinelli puts it perfectly in his review of Halloween Because of its title, Halloween has frequently been grouped together with all the other splatter films that populated theaters throughout the late-1970s and early-1980s. However, while Halloween is rightfully considered the father of the modern slasher genre, it is not a member... He has a point, and for a number of reasons. First and foremost, it's downright terrifying, whereas most entries into the teen slasher genre are dumb gore-fests (one could argue that many recent ones are tongue-in-cheek, but most of those fail as well). Second, there is almost no violence (very little of which is bloody). John Carpenter knows that violence does not equal scary, and he relies very little on it (actually, the body count is pretty low). In fact, one can argue that this isn't really a horror movie, at least not by todays standards of having the most deaths that can be crammed into a single movie, each gorier and more sadistic than the last. He relies on ideas for scares, and also skill. Third, while some of the characters may do stupid things (that sometimes seal their fate), they don't do them because they're dumb. The characters are real people, so instead of thinking that the characters die because they're idiots, we're frightened because they're making a mistake.One of the main reasons why Halloween is so scary is because it is so easy to believe that it's real. Nothing is hard to swallow in this film. There's no supernatural, there's no ridiculously creative plot elements, or inventive murders, or whatnot. Instead, all the set pieces and camera work (save the opening sequence) are simple. Carpenter just sets the camera in place and says action. What we get is the feeling that we're actually seeing a murder take place right in front of us.Horror movies are probably the most difficult films to make because in order for something to be scary, everything has to be perfect, and ideas never work twice. It's a hit or miss game, which is why if I were to tell you all the good ideas that Carpenter has (which I'm not), they'd seem primitive (particularly since they have been repeated with lesser effect over and over again through the years).Acting here is not a plus point because it doesn't need to be. This is a movie about scary ideas, not a movie about dramatic, conflicted characters. The actors act like real people, not characters from a story. Nothing more. The exception to this is whoever plays The Shape, or later known as Michael Myers. It can be scary to have a person say nothing and simply kill, but it's hard to pull off (and even harder to keep people from asking why). But the guy pulls it off, and the result is terrifying.This is Carpenter's movie through and through. He directed it, co-wrote it, co-produced it, and wrote the chilling score of it. This is a man of brilliance, and his later movie The Thing supports this statement, though The Thing is not as scary as Halloween. Unfortunately his success has dramatically diminished, as it happens when the lure of big money for less freedom is taken advantage of once big time producers recognize your potential. As good as this film is, it's not without flaws. The famous opening scene is disturbing, but not very scary. And not many of the scares work for the first part of the movie. It's not that it's bad, it's just that there's no good reason to fear The Shape. Luckily, Carpenter mostly uses this time to set up a relationship between the characters and the audience. While there's no intimacy in this relationship, it fits the purpose. We grow to know the characters, but not so much that it's disheartening when they die. But once the film gets to Halloween night, that's when Carpenter kicks things into high gear and it NEVER stops until you get to the end.While Halloween may be flawed, it is only slightly so. It is an immensely terrifying film, and a must see for anyone who loves scary movies. Be warned though, this movie will scare the living hell out of you!

This is a man of brilliance, and his later movie The Thing supports this statement, though The Thing is not as scary as Halloween. Unfortunately his success has dramatically diminished, as it happens when the lure of big money for less freedom is taken advantage of once big time producers recognize your potential. As good as this film is, it's not without flaws. The famous opening scene is disturbing, but not very scary. And not many of the scares work for the first part of the movie. It's not that it's bad, it's just that there's no good reason to fear The Shape. Luckily, Carpenter mostly uses this time to set up a relationship between the characters and the audience. While there's no intimacy in this relationship, it fits the purpose. We grow to know the characters, but not so much that it's disheartening when they die. But once the film gets to Halloween night, that's when Carpenter kicks things into high gear and it NEVER stops until you get to the end.While Halloween may be flawed, it is only slightly so. It is an immensely terrifying film, and a must see for anyone who loves scary movies. Be warned though, this movie will scare the living hell out of you!

From the start, he knows exactly what could go wrong if he becomes a rat for IA, but he still goes ahead and does it. The real problem is that when everything DOES go wrong, he is just astonished. Unfortunately, that astonishment translates into Treat Williams bellowing and shrieking for almost three hours, while the audience just shakes our heads in indifference. His Danny Ciello is everything which is wrong with cop movies or cop TV shows; the self-pity and self-obsession, the constant rationalization, the hiding behind cop myths and partner myths, and the corruption. The movie is such that to have a point, the viewer would have to empathize on some level with it's protagonist, but this protagonist, and the actor who portrays him, make that impossible. His issues are non-issues. He wasn't taken in, he wasn't deceived, he knew exactly what was going to go wrong, and then it did. His only real issue is that he's upset about it. We aren't upset for him, because he walked right into it. When he lies, he's not convincing. When other characters believe his lies, they just make us angry at their stupidity. When he lies again and again about giving drugs to his informants, he wears out our patience completely, and when he reacts in fury that no one believes him, we get up to do the dishes.Toward the end of the movie, James Tolkan's prosecutor character confronts Ciello and says, That's how you got here, don't you understand? Williams' facial expression here is unintentionally hilarious, because it is obvious that he does not, in fact, understand, anymore than he has understood anything else that's happened in the film.Lindsey Crouse as Danny's wife has all the personality and warmth of a statue in a dump in the dead of winter. None of her interactions, or her purpose as a character, make any sense. Neither do Williams' interactions make any sense. In the beginning, he smacks his brother around. His brother is screaming his head off, and Danny is beating the hell out of him, but we don't know what they're talking about, and it is not clear what this is supposed to show us about either of them, so there's no point to any of it. This scene, like most of the film, just comes off as an acting class exercise of some sort. If he's not screaming at someone or trying to choke them to death, he's hugging them like they are his dearest friends. None of these are ever appropriate to the scene or to the characters.The movie is easily an hour too long. A 2-hour film, or a 90-minute film, would have been fine, because there is not enough story for more than that. You could chop out the middle hour, have a placard that said 3 years later, show the concluding scenes, and it would be over. Having no story allows Sidney Lumet to practice cinematographic techniques without distractions. A film school student might enjoy watching his touches here and there, but an acting student, or a viewer hoping to be entertained, should avoid it like the plague.

He liked recognition from time to time, and to be able to get his voice out to as many people as he could. But- and this is from the looks of the film and from what else has come up about Guthrie- he never sold out. He wasn't a political figure, but his songs had that driving force of politics, of something inspirational, that couldn't be reached through typical rhetoric. When Guthrie goes through the fields of workers picking artichokes or workers at a factory and he goes on and on singing his protest songs until the bosses beat him up and wreck his guitar, it's about as close as a political act as one has ever seen a singer\/musician in a based-on-a-true-story picture. But at the same time Hal Ashby isn't out to make an entirely explicit 'message' heavy movie, even if there is, of course, messages to be taken to heart.It's about the man himself, and the times and circumstances that drove Woody Guthrie on his own, apart from his family, in mid 1930s depression era America. One could look at the film as an examination of a man caught in such dire times, of a country where the line between rich and poor was so significant there was barely any middle ground. But one can also look at it as the story of a wanderer, someone who- as his protégée Bob Dylan would later make as his proclamation in Like a Rolling Stone with no direction home- always felt a little restless. His journey is what really counts and shapes his music and outlook. It almost comes close to what it must be to have faith; if you want to sing, just sing, as Guthrie tells a bunch of kids (a little simplistic but with a kernel of truth), no matter what it's about. To suddenly find more meaning in the songs from the circumstances becomes part of the narrative, of a man who could be a hero in the historical sense while not being the kind of man who would be entirely one to aspire to be. He's happy to just walk down a road and sing his songs for anyone who will hear, as his family leaves him behind and any chance of conventional success floats by the wayside.It's hard not to make messages in a film where its character in real life once had the ultimate f***-you to the establishment right on his guitar case (This machine kills fascists). But it's the high skill of film-making, and the performance at the lead, that enrich what is already potent, awesome material. Haskell Wexler, the late-great cinematographer behind Cuckoo's Nest and Medium Cool, puts his stamp significantly as a work of Americana of the traditionalist sense a dust-storm is like something both alien and beautiful, while the train scenes are exciting, lush with vibrancy with dirt all around. Ashby, too, has a mark here from his editing days; there's not one transition from scene to scene that doesn't have a fade, making it a step removed from the usual lot of films at the time (even Ashby's) where just a straight cut-to or a jump-cut would suffice. He could've made this film, in the technical sense, twenty years before and it wouldn't of made much of a difference.And finally, David Carradine. If Kill Bill is the guiltiest pleasure of his career, Bound for Glory is his serious triumph as an actor. He's got that quality, which may or may not have been like the real Guthrie, that sucks a viewer in even when the character does something or says something that shouldn't feel like it's the thing to do as the protagonist of the story. He's a character led solely by his convictions, and Carradine enriches that through the performances of the songs, and his own self-confidence radiating just walking down a road or going to do something out of the goodness of his soul. From every moment he's on screen, as if in some kind of folk-rhythm mode out of Kung-fu, he's mesmerizing, in a performance that should've been nominated along with De Niro, Finch and Giannini in the best actor race (albeit more low-key than the others).

Given the film's astronomical success, it wasn't long before a sequel came along Mad Max 2 wastes no time whatsoever, introducing us to another ragtag band of murderous psychopaths mere moments into the film. Meanwhile, Max has since abandoned his family dwelling (his family having been mercilessly slaughtered in the first film) and is something of a drifter, living on dog food and always in search of gasoline for his trusty, and now iconic vehicle - the V8 Interceptor. Max eventually stumbles across a small community with a rather copious gasoline supply, the only problem being that the town is under siege by a villainous gang.This sequel takes a little more time to get going than its predecessor - rather than throwing us headlong into the action as the original film did, this takes a more stoic approach to things, with Max observing the carnage from afar before deciding to get involved. It might just be that his personal tragedies have taught him to exhibit an air of tact, in assessing a situation before running in all guns blazing.Viewers will quickly realise that this is as unforgiving and morally devoid as the original film - led by the imposing, monstrous Lord Humungous, the evil gang viciously murder inhabitants of the town in an attempt to pilfer its gasoline supply. The fact that they ultimately give the townspeople 24 hours to peacefully hand over the town (and moreover, its gasoline reserves) would suggest that they are slightly more humane than the antagonists of the first film, but rest assured that this group are as brutal as anything seen in the first film.As you can expect, Max becomes caught in the middle of the squabbling inhabitants, and ultimately acts as a directional force, a leader in their fight, although Max doesn't take this as a charity case - he's getting as much gasoline as he can carry out of it. In this sense, it's great to see that the character of Max never lets up in looking out for his best interests first, and as such, he is something of an anti-hero.The first half of Mad Max 2 may be a little restrained for some - the action is few and far between, but is essentially build-up for the action-packed second half, beginning with Max engaging the gang in a high-speed automobile demolition derby. The smashmouth style of car-chase direction from the first film quickly returns in full, violent force, as well as the rather homoerotic attire of the villains.From this point, the narrative follows a similar structure to the first film - both Max's side and the opposing gang incur losses in a string of violent exchanges, each time regrouping and then returning to fight soon after. Max, the unlucky soul that he is, merely wishes to get out of dodge with his gasoline and his car (frankly he doesn't see this as his battle), yet as it turns out, in another ironic twist, Max may well have been safer in the town, as he is waylaid and left for dead moments after leaving. Furthermore, the enemies crawling around the desert wasteland are now more dangerous than ever, using nitrous oxide to drive even faster (and as such, more dangerously) than before (and you thought The Fast and the Furious used that gimmick first?).Max ostensibly ends up right back where he started, thanks to what is near-enough Max's only foible in the series up to this point. Max, driven only by his own need to escape these heinous monsters, agrees to aid the town in their escape, resulting in a full-throttle, white-knuckle thrill ride, taking place both on the lush desert terrain and even in the sky to a degree. The exciting finale is explosion-laden and every bit as unforgivingly brutal as the original film's, and no matter how many times a body is hurled under a car in this film (and no matter how many times I watch it), it is still shocking.Max Rockatansky, now black and bruised, with enemies literally coming from all angles and directions, is solidified as an action-hero by Gibson's steely performance, portraying a character who never lets up, and will not be stopped with such gusto and enthusiasm that it's near-impossible not to take a shine to both Max as a character and Gibson as a performer.After an exciting and bombastically violent finale, as with the first film, the desert sand has little time to settle before the credits hit. Miller clearly has no interest in providing any padding or gentle decline for the audience, and frankly, this film is all the better for it.As a sequel, Mad Max 2 is seemingly unnecessarily but ultimately well-executed. It takes a little while to get to the meat of the matter, but once it does, it delivers as many adrenaline-fuelled thrills as the original, with as much directorial craftsmanship also.

One finds it hard to both read and comprehend the book at the same time. I myself read the novel before I saw any of the film adaptations. Why? I don't know. I just had a curiosity for the book. And while I did find it difficult, and I mean VERY difficult to read, I found it kind of fascinating and it became number one of my list to try and find and view the various film versions that had been adapted over the years. The first one I managed to see was an infamous, rare version from the 30s starring John Barrymore. It was a very loose adaptation and not exactly faithful to Melville's original writing. The second version I saw was this popular and well-praised version starring Gregory Peck as the madman Captain Ahab hunting for the white, disfigured whale that took off his leg. The 1956 version of Moby Dick is a true masterpiece, a very well-done and splendid sea story that manages to stay faithful to Melville's original novel. And being a film done in more modern times, it can make it easier for others to understand what was happening all the time in the novel.The film was perfectly cast in all regards. Gregory Peck, more famous for playing the popular cinema hero Atticus Finch in the film adaptation of To Kill a Mockingbird for which he won his only Oscar in his career, played quite the opposite of a character in Moby Dick. Here, he is the wild and vicious Capt. Ahab whose primary concern to hunt down the notorious whale responsible for the loss of his leg. Peck's performance was exactly what I wanted. It reminded me very much of Robert Shaw's performance in another sea story classic Jaws (1975). Unlike the 1930 version of Moby Dick, this version depicts Capt. Ahab just as I had imagined him after reading the book. I had pictured Capt. Ahab as being tall, wearing dark clothes, never changing his expression, and being at a state where you couldn't possibly imagine what he was like before he first encountered the white whale. I can't imagine what Ahab could have looked like or acted like prior to losing his leg and becoming a hysterical madman obsessed with gaining his vengeance.But what I love most about Moby Dick is that it has substance. It's a film that knows what it's suppose to be and does a great job at it. It was meant to be a great sea story and while it does not really provide for all of the symbolism that Melville wrote into his book, it doesn't need to. The film was not suppose to be an allegorical masterpiece, but just a simple sit-back-and-enjoy it masterpiece. Director John Huston even stated in an interview that he never could understand Melville's style of writing and therefore, I assume he did not see a need to incorporate allegory into the film. Really, it works out better, because it's about the hunt for a dangerous and powerful animal. It's not suppose to be trying to give lessons for the future generations. And it doesn't.Special effects wise, the film was a triumph for its age. True, by today's standards, it's not the greatest. The lighting on the characters in the green-screening was a bit flawed. But then again, today's standards did not exist in 1956. Moby Dick himself and the other whales seen on the screen were all created using mechanical creatures that would simply rise up and down in the water and in some cases, open and close their mouths or even leap into the air. The final battle with Moby Dick is spectacular. We don't see the white whale for a long time and he is just referenced countless times by Ahab and the others about how enormous, powerful, and legendary he is. And by the time we see him at last, he almost seems vulnerable and typical, except for his paleness of the skin. But when attacked, he becomes a vicious monster that matches his reputation or even exceeds beyond it.In short, Moby Dick is a very good movie and for its age, a true masterpiece.

That is why they always give good reviews to bad films and bad reviews to good films. Overall no matter what ever happens there will never be a worse film than Crap Fiction. Any movie in the IMDb bottom 100 is better and I would like to salute anyone who has given it a 1 out of 10.

I intended to watch Pulp Fiction & Reservoir Dogs after I seen Kill Bill Vol 1 & 2 which I really liked because of the same director Quentin Tarantino. He became my favourite director after I seen Kill Bill Vol 1 & 2 but no longer when I seen Pulp Fiction. It has all the possible bad things in a film and the list is endless. There is nothing but drug use and swearing that made my ears bleed, the F word was repeated more times than the number of heartbeats of a person's lifetime. None of the stories were appealing...in fact I just don't know what's going on because there was no structure or plot. The film was about 2.5 hours and I hated every second, it was Extremely boring that I had a sore head & I felt like ripping my arm out and constantly bash my head with it. Anyway I can go on forever.I just don't know why it's #5 on the IMDb top 250? Maybe because mostly people have accidentally clicked on 10 instead of 1 out of 10. Quentin Tarantino must have pulled the script from his bum and was running about in a circle with it then his wife must of hit him on the head with a rolling pin and said, You promised me no more rubbish films! He must of found a brain in a fruit bowl before he made Kill Bill he also looks like a idiot and talks like a girl. Now I don't intend to watch Reservoir Dogs.

Well, that was it's whole purpose. Like The Brother McMullen, this star-vehicle was written and directed by Townsend about his dream to make it as a professional actor, trying to break into Hollywood, while at the same time, trying to over-come the cruel limitations mainstream Hollywood has set up for black people who want to act... and actors, in general.Whereas the '70's was the birth decade of the blaxploitation, so many of them were just cheap, cheesy, corny knock-offs of popular white films. Blaxploitation got more blacks into films, but the films themselves weren't really about anything. Hollywood Shuffle is a Blaxploitation film that really has something to say... that has an agenda.There is so much burning talent, so many struggling entertainers wanting to make something of themselves, that Hollywood can afford to treat the auditioning talent the same way a really strong cleanser treats germs.Townsend's efforts to make this movie are inspiring--he borrowed every dollar he could, asked for movie footage that was left on the cutting-room floor, called in every favor he could, threw everything he had and more to get this one made.To tell his story, get his foot in the door... and at the same time, tell a story about what this kind of life is like. For those with talent who dare to dream big.Greats Keenan Ivory Wayans and John Witherspoon have bit players as people who work at a hog stand in the neighborhood who don't ask for much out of life... and don't get it. They're the kind of cynics who believe, You're a fool for following your dreams. When you near the end of your journey in this world, you really fully understand the meaning of the old phrase, Nothing ventured, nothing gained. Townsend interlocks a variety of skits with this all-too autobiographical tale, all of which are pretty funny and inspiring. You have to admire the way that Townsend wants to put out some legitimate roles for black actors to play and black actors to idolize. But most of his skits go on too long after the point has been made and there are quite a few moments that feel like someone (Townsend obviously) should have punched up. Townsend is a far better actor than he is a writer\/director.Perhaps because he is only a filmmaker by necessity for this one. He's more interested in using this to make up of all those dream roles he never got to play and showing his chops as an actor than really making a great movie.There's a scene where he takes-off Siskel & Ebert--before everyone started doing it. Almost all the skits (where Townsend is fantasizing his dream roles as an actor) go on way too long, probably because Townsend is far less concerned with how funny the skits\/movie is and more interested in using this movie to play all the dream roles he never got to before.Every actor is perfectly cast, especially Townsend himself. It's great to see him playing all these roles you know he's always dreamed of doing (he plays them while his character actually IS day-dreaming).The movie captures the struggle of the out-of-work actor just right. We see lines and lines of actors warming-up, rehearsing their roles, going into the audition... all to hear, Thank you, next! But some blessed, precious few are picked.But those that are black are given racially-biased drivel to perform. Ethnic caricatures that shame and set back their race. Brothers and sisters who talk like stock characters from the slave era, wearing redneck farm clothes, picking cotton, eating chicken and getting stinking drunk. Townsend tirades many black archetypes, most of which went out of style around the same time as black-face. Lil' Bobby obviously wants to say something about the way the brothers and sisters are treated in the biz. There are some moments here you'll roar with laughter at, as well as put a lump in your throat and a strange feeling of hope and pride. Like many other breakthrough films, especially independents, Hollywood Shuffle was another arrival of a fresh new talent. It happens as often as the rise and setting of the suns, but here is a film where it feels a little more special&#x85; because Townsend was really about something. You can see it here, not only in some of his satirist scenes, but some of the quieter moments where real drama in brewing and dreams are at stake.We see where Townsend is asking himself if he's good enough, if he face the whole world (which is how it is when you're struggling to make it as an entertainer&#x85; or in life) and when life-long happiness is at stake. It almost hurts. And at the end of it all, when we wonder for Townsend's character, Bobby's sake&#x85; what will become of him? And then we realize we already know. We just found out.It's like looking in the sky at the stars like you always do&#x85; and then there's a brand-new star shining in the night sky, standing out just a little bit bigger than the others.

The film is seen in the eyes of a very intelligent young boy who's love of Rock and Roll was started by his older sister. His sister who's rebellious ways caused her to leave her strict household was always somewhat of a role model to him. Williams mother was very strict and very much set on her ways but having her daughter leave her really opened her eyes and made her raise William somewhat more leniently.He is a very intelligent young man who gets the opportunity of a lifetime to write for Rolling Stone. He gets to follow an up an coming band in their road to stardom and on the way meets a self titled Band-aid named Penny Lane. She is a free spirited groupie who refuses such a title and instead calls herself a fan of the music. It is Penny who introduces William to this wild life of Rock and Roll. His assignment is to go on tour with the band for a couple of days, but the band members are such party animals that they are always putting off any type of actual interview. This gets to be a problem for William since in Journalism it always helps to have actual quotes from the source the worst part of it all is that he actually becomes friends with the band so when it comes down to actually writing his story and revealing the groups downfalls he can't do it.Media in those days was different from today in the sense that before there was less available press time for bands as opposed to now where there are way too many media outlets for an upcoming band or singer. The many media outlets however don't mean that it is easy for a band to get press there is just a lot more of it. Now in days there are even celebrities who have gotten famous of sites like Myspace.com. Lilly Allen for example is a star from the UK who started posting her music on myspace, a talent agent heard it and now she's relatively famous and is signed to a major record label. Our growing media source however has changed negatively when it comes to celebrities privacy. In the movie William is reluctant to publish any negative remarks about the band so because of his reluctance the world may or may not find out exactly what went on behind the scenes.

His wife is pregnant and he knows that with a baby on the way he must try to find a better paying job.

One of which is a character played by Glenn Close, she is a cut-throat somewhat kneiving journalist and in the movie seems to be one of Michael Keaton's characters biggest challenges. She doesn't think that his story is valid and insist that he not run it, instead she wants to go for a safer less controversial cover. On the same day he has an interview with a competing much more renowned newspaper, he has to squeeze it in his schedule so this just adds to the pressure. He also has a dinner date with his wife and parents, whether he makes it or not I will not tell but I will say this, the ending is a heartfelt one and for the most part everyone ends up happy.The Paper was over all a pretty decent movie considering that it's not a movie that I would usually watch. The story line was touching and very unique. It gave viewers the insight on the thrill and the rush you get when working for a low budget paper. That especially interest me because It is a career choice that I am still considering. I was also pretty surprised to hear that it was nominated for an Oscar, I'm sure that the A-list actors had something to do with it.

The main role is portrayed by Michael Keaton, he plays a head writer for this news paper and throughout the story he must decide whether it is worth it for him to stick it out that this paper or leave to a more prominent one. His wife is pregnant and he knows that with a baby on the way he must try to find a better paying job. To many people this would sound like a clear and easy decision to make but sometimes the most practical things can be the hardest to do. He loves his job and this is obvious when he spends the entire day trying to track a story down, he puts aside his own career opportunities, even his own wife to break the story.He has to deal with many obstacles on his way to actually getting the story. One of which is a character played by Glenn Close, she is a cut-throat somewhat kneiving journalist and in the movie seems to be one of Michael Keaton's characters biggest challenges.

Kim) Harry has to investigate the death of rock star Johnny Squares (Jim Carrey) when he is discovered dead in his trailer on the set of a horror film. With help from a local new reporter Samantha Walker (Patricia Clarkson) Harry discovers the existence of a dead pool, a list of celebrities which horror film director Peter Swan (Liam Neeson) & some of his friends bet on who will die before a certain date. It quickly transpires that someone is systematically going through Peter's list & killing the celebrities off one-by-one & Harry learns that his name is on the list which makes him a potential victim...Directed by Buddy Van Horn this was the fifth & to date final Dirty Harry film, I haven't seen all of them as yet but I thought The Dead Pool was a pretty good if unspectacular 80's tough cop thriller. The script by Steve Sharon is alright, it has a fairly good story that tries something different for the genre although one has to say I felt it had more potential than it ultimately delivered. The idea of a dead pool lottery style bet about celebrities dying could have made for a great film but here the idea is underdeveloped, it's never revealed what the point of the dead pool is in the first place. I mean it's seemingly nothing more than a silly bet between a horror director & a few of his friends, it's never revealed what the actual prize was meant to be or just how seriously those involved took it & it gets forgotten as the number of murder victims grow. What I'm trying to say is that I never felt there was sufficient reason behind the killings & the climax which reveals it was the work of a lone psychotic was somewhat underwhelming. The Dead Pool also tries to say something relevant about media coverage of crimes & cops, this is quite well handled & the point is made effectively enough. The makers could have had a lot of fun with the dead pool & turned this into a gripping thriller, as it is it's a decent action thriller that passes the time but ultimately doesn't live long in the memory once it's over.Director Van Horn does alright, it moves along at a decent pace, there's some good action scenes & shoot-outs along with an imaginative car chase in which Dirty Harry is chased across San Francisco by a remote controlled car packed with explosives! Harry himself is still a great character & he has everything it took to be an action hero back in the 80's, the utter & total contempt for authority, the droll one-liners & the need to use excessive & deadly force at all times which he also had during the 70's of course. He has it all, he's maybe a bit old but he still holds his own as he blows bad guy's away left, right & center. There's some violence & a bit of blood which helps things along nicely.Technically the film is good, it has that solid Hollywood big budget feel to it & it's well made especially the car chase. Shot on location in San Francisco despite, according to the IMDb, the cities residents (people with obviously too much time on their hands) protesting that 'Dirty' Harry Callahan would be a bad character to represent the city! The acting is OK, there are early roles for Liam Neeson & Jim Carrey while the members of Guns N'Roses appear as extras at the funeral of Johnny Squares.The Dead Pool is a solid action thriller, it's not the best one ever made but it's far from the worst. Dirty Harry fans should like it & general action fans should too, worth a watch if nothing else.

To call her wild is a mistake. But to call her beautiful, now you're on to something. That woman is Nell.Nell is played by Jodie Foster, giving an extraordinarily passionate performance of zero inhibitions. This is a woman so in love with life. But a life built on her terms. To the outside observer, she appears unrestrained. Even animalistic. And she speaks a language completely alien. But that's how she likes it.Nell is a woman of pure spirit. And a fiery spirit. She lives in a shack in the woods, where the only company she ever shared was that of her mother, and her twin sister. Both have died in Nell's lifetime. The sister in childhood. And the mother in adulthood. Nell is perfectly capable of looking after herself in her private solitude, but it isn't long before outside civilisation comes calling.Dr Jerome Lovell (Liam Neeson) discovers Nell, and when he can't seem to get through to her, he has no choice but to call in some help. Dr Paula Olsen (Natasha Richardson) is an ambitious young scientist who thinks Nell would be best served being observed behind the walls of an institution.When this matter goes to court, the judge decides to have Jerome and Paula observe Nell in her natural habitat for three months. Then Nell's future can be determined.I suppose in some sense, Nell has implausibilities. There are questions that did keep nagging in the back of my mind through all this. Like how Nell's mother provided for her daughter. We see a courier dropping off supplies. But where Nell's mother got the money from is anyone's guess. Its a testament to Michael Apted's smooth direction and smart screenplay by Mark Handley and William Nicholson that these occasional illogicities don't completely capsize the film.But more importantly its Jodie Foster's vibrant, spirited performance that carries the entire movie. As I was watching Nell (movie and character), I kept being reminded of Rain Man. Nell is not exactly autistic, like Dustin Hoffman's character, but she is closed and sheltered from society. She screams when confronted with the unknown. Lashes out at others like a trapped animal.Nell is a film that asks a great deal of its audience. The first 25 minutes requires Jodie Foster to scream and mumble an incomprehensible language. You may feel entirely tempted to switch off the film in frustration. But if you have patience, it will be rewarded.I enjoyed Nell so much more than Rain Man. I've never been able to understand what people saw in that film. Dustin Hoffman's performance seemed rather irritating. He never really stripped his mental condition away, to see the tortured man behind the impairment. And his Oscar win was unbelievable.Jodie Foster by comparison runs rings around Hoffman. You're never in any doubt there is a fragile creature behind Nell's tough exterior. Nell's private language may be baffling, but watch the emotions conveyed in Foster's face and her expressive eyes. Its a superb performance of surprising, accessible depths.Liam Neeson and Natasha Richardson are OK. Even if, in a sense they are competitors, they become surrogate parents to Nell. Something that Nell seems to recognise, and even accepts. As good as they're performances are, this is Foster's show.Jodie Foster has always been one of my favourite actresses. And Nell is one of the meatiest roles she's ever had the pleasure of sinking her teeth into. She so completely immerses herself in the part. Its one of the things I've always admired about Jodie Foster. Once she loses herself in a character, she never abandons it. She stays true to it.And Handley and Nicholson have crafted a truly complex character that Foster does a superb job of bringing to life. I like the way they've sketched a whole life story for Nell. They don't shortchange us on the details. Nell's mother had a stroke, and she could only speak out of one side of her face. This is what formed the basis of Nell's language. The only other person who spoke Nell's language was her twin sister. Something they secretly shared. And when she died, a piece of Nell died with her.For the most part, Nell steers admirably clear of forced sentiment. Its only towards the end that it goes a little off course. Apted sadly resorts to that cliché of many a melodrama. The courtroom speech. Nell speaks her heart, with Jerome as her interpretor. I get the impression Apted wasn't sure how to close the book on this. Its unfortunate the way he chose to attempt it, because it only strips Nell of the mystery and intrigue that made her such a fascinating character to watch.But still, Nell is a quite wonderful film. Jodie Foster again shows off her fantastic versatility as an actress. And its so refreshing to see a tender story that's actually tender but (mostly) avoids the clichés that come with it.

Shortly after two cops arrive looking for Billy, Nick senses something is wrong then a big guy named Slag (Randall 'Tex' Cobb) turns up & things get violent. Despite being blind Nick is a master swordsman & takes the bad guy's down but Lynn is shot dead in the process, feeling responsible Nick sets out to find Frank & discover what sort of trouble he is in & protect Billy at the same time. However the bad guy's are only just starting & Nick finds himself in danger every step of the way...Directed by Phillip Noyce Blind Fury is one of those cheesy 80's action comedy flicks which is almost impossible to dislike despite knowing that you should. The script by associate producer Charles Robert Carner is a very light hearted remake of the Japanese martial arts film Zatoichi Challenged (1967) & thankfully doesn't take itself too seriously which helps the already silly central story, I mean sequences when Nick who is totally blind dodges guy's with automatic machine guns, defeats other swordsmen who can see & drives a van in a high speed car chase by having the young boy Billy give him directions like 'left', 'right' & 'straight on' really do need the viewer to suspend their disbelief. However if you can & just take Blind Fury for what it is then there's plenty of fun to be had here, there's some cool fights, shoot-outs & even a cool car chase to keep you entertained across it's 90 odd minute duration. The character's are likable which helps, there is some funny dialogue & the film also has a Lethal Weapon (1987) feel to it with the whole clichéd mismatched partner plot where at first Nick & Billy dislike each other but as they get to know one another a mutual respect & strong friendship forms & despite being clichéd it actually works rather well in Blind Fury.Director Noyce does a good job, he keeps the pace up & things moving along nicely with some well choreographed action scenes. Blind Fury is also notable for some laugh out loud hilarious scenes as well, the opening montage of the Vietnamese villagers training the blind Nick with a sword & a vegetable are almost as funny as the scene in which Nick is sitting against a tree & he hears a buzzing sound & after one swipe of his sword there is a shot of a cut in half bee falling to the ground! Just the whole idea of a blind man cutting a flying bee in half with a sword is just too funny for words & has to be seen to be believed. As does the bit when Nick cuts the eyebrows off a bad guy with his sword! Unfortunately it's sometimes hard to relate Nick with blindness as he does all sorts of things a blind man in reality would find impossible, he has sword fights with people & wins, he walks around buildings & places he's never been before & never bumps into or falls over things, he drives a van he'd never sat in before & there are many things he does which he would have to be able to see to do. Nick's blindness could have been used much more effectively than it was. The violence isn't too excessive, there's a severed hand & Nick cuts a bad guy in half at the end but there's not much else in the way of graphic violence.Technically the film is good & has a solid 80's action feel to it, according to the IMDb Blind Fury was shot in Houston, Texas & in Reno, Nevada & strangely in Australia. It's well made & looks nice enough for what it is. The acting is alright, Rutger Hauer is Rutger Hauer I suppose which says it all while Noble Willingham puts in a bit of practise as the bad guy in preparation for his similar role in the Bruce Willis action flick The Last Boy Scout (1991) made a couple of years after Blind Fury.Blind Fury turned out to be a much better action flick than I had anticipated it would be, there's some neat action, a decent story & some funny moments that passed 90 odd minutes pleasantly enough for me. A must for cheesy 80's action junkies like me!

Shortly after two cops arrive looking for Billy, Nick senses something is wrong then a big guy named Slag (Randall 'Tex' Cobb) turns up & things get violent.

However the bad guy's are only just starting & Nick finds himself in danger every step of the way...Directed by Phillip Noyce Blind Fury is one of those cheesy 80's action comedy flicks which is almost impossible to dislike despite knowing that you should. The script by associate producer Charles Robert Carner is a very light hearted remake of the Japanese martial arts film Zatoichi Challenged (1967) & thankfully doesn't take itself too seriously which helps the already silly central story, I mean sequences when Nick who is totally blind dodges guy's with automatic machine guns, defeats other swordsmen who can see & drives a van in a high speed car chase by having the young boy Billy give him directions like 'left', 'right' & 'straight on' really do need the viewer to suspend their disbelief. However if you can & just take Blind Fury for what it is then there's plenty of fun to be had here, there's some cool fights, shoot-outs & even a cool car chase to keep you entertained across it's 90 odd minute duration.

The acting is great, the film has a great pace of action and horror, the Aliens look scary especially the Alien Queen.After the events of ALIEN Ripley when into hyper sleep and her ship floated through space and now it's been picked by a salvage crew who find Ripley alive in her cryotube so they take to the ship run by the company and once she recovers she's told that she's been floating through space for years, she soon gives her story of what happened to the company but of course they don't believe her so her license is taken from her but she then learns that the planet was made livable and a colony is there, Ripley is then told a while later that they've lost contact with the people on the planet and they need her to go there since she's encountered the Aliens before, at first she refuses but then she thinks about and offers to go if they're there just to eliminate them not to capture and study.While they wait to reach the planet Ripley meets some of the Marines, and while having dinner Bishop does his famous knife trick but cuts his finger where Ripley sees the white android blood and asks Burke why a android is with them but the Marines always send a android on a mission but Ripley doesn't like him since Ash malfunctioned and tried to kill her and was working under company orders. Soon they land on the planet and the Marines go in, all they find is acid burns.

Ripley tells them that Burke was going to impregnate her and Newt so that the Company would have the two Aliens, he would also sabotage the Mariens cryotubes.
