All in all, it's consciousness is what makes it everything that is wrong with our world. Man On The Moon is not for one second taking itself too seriously. I've always been a fan of Carrey but it is Man On The Moon that made me realise that there is no higher level of acting than this. THIS IS EASILY HIS BEST PERFORMANCE.Man On The Moon has the most extraordinary of beginnings and the story relation is different yet captivating and it doesn't make you wanna be anywhere else for one second. Based on the life of Andy Kaufman, this film manages to recreate the life of an extraordinary man. Many people felt Jim Carrey is Andy Kaufman. The level and kind of humor this film contains is not meant to be understood by an average movie go'er. Between the 41st minute and 91st minute the film goes into an enjoyable dull period where most actions by Andy have no explanation.I hate Bongo drums but I cannot believe anyone can possibly sound better on them than Andy in the film. The reason the casting of this film is perfect is because Jim Carrey has one big heart for a comedian. Andy's funeral was the most touching scene in the film and almost a tearjerker.I'm trying really hard to explain what it was about this film that touched my heart but I cannot quite get there because my comprehension fails me.

I realize some will dismiss the film because of its Rockwell-like sentiment (and because it's fashionable to dislike anything that's too sentimental these days), but I also think the story is balanced by an undertone of nasty, ugly reality. Remember, Jim Carrey's screenwriter is thrown into a rather spectacular series of events which end up with him taking an adventure in an almost latter-day Wonderland. A credit to his dramatic acting ability, he has a kind of wary disconnection throughout the whole film. (Even as he lives amongst all the virtue, idealism and patriotism of the Lawson citizens he does not seem to entirely believe it.) But every Oz must have its Kansas, and even Carrey 'wakes up' towards the end of the film to deal with the ugliness of the HUAC witch-hunt. But my favorite performer- and indeed the best thing in the movie- is Martin Landau. His patriarch who wears his heart on his sleeve is absolutely stunning throughout, and he gives the story a lot of earnestness and optimism (especially when he talks about the magic of movies- which I admit I kind of agree with). A strong second best performance comes from Laurie Holden, playing the beautiful law student who may (or may not) know Carrey from the past. Check it out.

However, as I recently became familiar with the works of Linklater through the mesmerizing rotoscope-animations of Waking Life and the film adaption of Philip K. Dick's A Scanner Darkly, the first in which the main-characters of this piece appear, I decided to give Before Sunrise a shot.First and most importantly should be said, that this movie effortlessly manages to dodge every cliché-filled pitfall of your typical, superficial Hollywood-love-fest. As with most of Linklater's work, this movie is extremely driven by it's dialogue, here to the point where you, on few occasions, almost find it to much. Fortunately, Linklater has a rare ability to write characters and dialogue with an unusual feel of honesty and depth, which is really what keeps this movie as captivating as it is.And this is where Before Sunrise truly separates itself from all it's pretentious, dreamworld love-flick-imitators. Because, as the common love-flick tends to focus on a ridiculous plot, a highly unrealistic yet still very predictable storyline, all usually disguised well in silly humor and poor acting, which never really seems to try and connect with it's viewer on anything but a hollow, dream-world level. Before Sunset steers clear of all that, by simply telling a story of two people connecting, and delivered in a way that enables most viewers to reflect their own experiences in the story. Granted, the romance unfolding in this picture is of the rare kind, but every piece of it is believable and never attempts to be more than it is.Combined with some fine and credible performances by the two main characters and a director who almost constantly manages to balance the story and the atmosphere just right, so it never ever gets mushy or uninteresting, this is definitely one romance-movie that is worth the watch. It is not packed with big allusive incidents, nor does it pretend to preach any real deeper meanings, but it does provide a compelling story of two people connecting, and does so in a way that most people will be able to relate to on an emotional level, and be able to appreciate on an intellectual one for the very well-written story, dialogue and directing.Hopefully the sequel which is next on the list will be as rewarding.

Why the movie didn't do better, I will never understand. The story of a man who is looking for love in a world that doesn't understand him is universal, it doesn't matter if he is gay or straight. Arnold Beckoff is a female illusionist in a successful club in New York. In the opening, as we watch him assume his stage persona (Virginia Hamm, we hear him expound on his views of relationships as a gay man who can be self assured and still not like himself much. We watch a typical performance with admiration for the work involved. After the performance we see Arnold and his friend Murray headed out for a nightcap and see Arnold's insecurities up close. While Murray appears to have a more hedonistic approach to the gay bar scene, Aronld clearly appears out of his element. As he bumps into Ed, we see a classic film meet-cute. They are both awkward and shy, but clearly attracted to one another. As the relation ship develops, we see that Arnold has almost a need to be in love, while Ed feels he needs to be in love-with a woman. Ed believes that he has to project an image, not just for his family and friends, but for himself. That is the one thing we learn that Arnold has no problem with, he wants people to know he's gay, and that is something he accepts in himself, whether or not his family does. We see a family dinner with his brother and parents, and that scene broke my heart. When his father offers him money until he gets back on his feet, I was uncomfortable and didn't understand why until a minute later when Arnold and his brother are out on the patio having a smoke, and Arnold reveals he makes more money than his father, and I realized just how uncomfortable his parents were with his life and the choices he has made, his mother especially. Soon Arnold does find love with Alan, a young model who came to one of Arnold's shows. Alan, like Arnold, is comfortable with who he is, and he and Arnold become a couple. Ed comes back briefly into their lives at this point, as he and his wife invite them to visit the rural home that Ed has rebuilt. This central part of the film is taken from the second play in the Trilogy-Fugue in a Nursery. This was the part that I felt the film did a disservice to by opening up. In the play, this takes place with the four characters in the same bed, with a wonderful lighting effect that highlights the actors as they interact with each other. The film does not ruin it by any means, but you do not get the urgency that the play brings out and the quick cuts become jarring, in my opinion. This section brings tension to both couples, but Arnold and Alan overcome it, and look forward to adopting a child, and moving to a new apartment. However, the night they move in, Alan makes a choice that while heroic, changes the course of Arnold's life. The change is what we see in the final part of the film. We learn that there have been changes with Ed as well. The section of the film becomes ultimately a healing. How family relationships change, how romantic relations change and mature, and how the first generation (Arnold's mother) comes to understand the third (David, Arnold's adopted son) as well as deriving a better understand of her son and the life he has made for himself. This is ultimately an uplifting and emotional film, with dream performances. I urge everyone to see it, but I think it may hold the most meaning to those people who have a friend or family member who is gay, but just doesn't understand. Watch this film and get some answers.

It features elements from almost every kind of comedy that has been made before. An unrelenting farce, Mad World never gives you a moment to rid yourself of the smiling face that you'll have during the two and a half hours it lasts.The story is supposedly very simple and it begins quite quick. An old prisoner who escaped from jail has a serious accident and before passing away, he reveals to the five witnesses around him that he buried a treasure in Santa Rosita Park under the big W.The five men agree to search for the treasure altogether, but because one of the guys is accompanied by his wife, another one by his spouse and his annoying mother-in-law, two of them are together and the last one is alone, dividing the treasure into equal parts becomes too much difficult (ah, women...), so it becomes every man for himself.From that moment, the movie turns into a monumental collection of goofy moments, involving more and more characters, each one earning his merit. They're all played by legendary comedic actors, ranging from Spencer Tracy to Jonathan Winters, and including Milton Berle, Sid Caesar, Buddy Hackett and Mickey Rooney. Other legends are also only cameos, such as Buster Keaton and the Three Stooges.The comic elements of Mad World are so much diverse that we could think that every joke or funny moment that has been put on screen is presented here.The movie is profoundly silly but is also surprisingly intelligent. I say intelligent because each gag is carefully plotted and it never seems out of context and never looks like an excuse.The result, for each scene, is the following one everything that could possibly go wrong DOES go wrong. And each plot element that could make the treasure chase easier for one of the contestants hides a trap that cancels the character's excitement and ignites ours.To prove it, just consider this part Melville (Sid Caesar) and his wife Monica (Edie Adams) are in Santa Rosita well before the others. All they have to do is go to the hardware to get a shovel and a pick. They're told that the owner is downstairs in the basement so they go there. However, the owner was upstairs and he unconsciously locks the basement, confining Melville and Monica into the basement.There are so many comedic moments like this one that we could almost forget that it is a treasure hunt. It's because of the quality of the Roses' (William and Tania) screenplay and of Stanley Kramer's solid direction, which is surprising when you consider that Kramer is a drama expert.The makers of the movie are so talented that they're able to turn a very simple plot into a comic extravaganza that lasts for about 155 minutes and we never notice time's running. And even when they all arrive into the Santa Rosita park, there's about one hour remaining, but surprises occur at every corner and the comic lot goes over again.The different jokes portrayed on screen vary from the unintentional firing of several firework boxes to the very last one (and most classic one) the legendary banana peel on which we stumble. Some of the most unforgettable moments are the tower controller falling and hanging from the tower, Melville and Monica jailed inside the hardware basement and their numerous escape attempts, Dingy and Benjy trying to fly a plane and the list goes on and on and on...However, the best moments are certainly the climatic triple-car chase and the slapstick finale in a condemned building and on a firetruck's ladder...So, so, so... You want to laugh a lot and you don't know what to rent, buy or watch? Look no further. This hilarious near-celebration of comedy itself is unrelentingly funny from the beginning to the end. Because of the laughs it provides, it makes you understand how the world is mad, mad, mad, mad...

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy"},{"date":"29 August 2006","score":"9 out of 14 people found the following review useful","review":" It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World could be described as the quintessential comedy. It features elements from almost every kind of comedy that has been made before. An unrelenting farce, Mad World never gives you a moment to rid yourself of the smiling face that you'll have during the two and a half hours it lasts.The story is supposedly very simple and it begins quite quick. An old prisoner who escaped from jail has a serious accident and before passing away, he reveals to the five witnesses around him that he buried a treasure in Santa Rosita Park under the big W.The five men agree to search for the treasure altogether, but because one of the guys is accompanied by his wife, another one by his spouse and his annoying mother-in-law, two of them are together and the last one is alone, dividing the treasure into equal parts becomes too much difficult (ah, women...), so it becomes every man for himself.From that moment, the movie turns into a monumental collection of goofy moments, involving more and more characters, each one earning his merit. They're all played by legendary comedic actors, ranging from Spencer Tracy to Jonathan Winters, and including Milton Berle, Sid Caesar, Buddy Hackett and Mickey Rooney. Other legends are also only cameos, such as Buster Keaton and the Three Stooges.The comic elements of Mad World are so much diverse that we could think that every joke or funny moment that has been put on screen is presented here.The movie is profoundly silly but is also surprisingly intelligent. I say intelligent because each gag is carefully plotted and it never seems out of context and never looks like an excuse.The result, for each scene, is the following one everything that could possibly go wrong DOES go wrong. And each plot element that could make the treasure chase easier for one of the contestants hides a trap that cancels the character's excitement and ignites ours.To prove it, just consider this part Melville (Sid Caesar) and his wife Monica (Edie Adams) are in Santa Rosita well before the others. All they have to do is go to the hardware to get a shovel and a pick. They're told that the owner is downstairs in the basement so they go there. However, the owner was upstairs and he unconsciously locks the basement, confining Melville and Monica into the basement.There are so many comedic moments like this one that we could almost forget that it is a treasure hunt. It's because of the quality of the Roses' (William and Tania) screenplay and of Stanley Kramer's solid direction, which is surprising when you consider that Kramer is a drama expert.The makers of the movie are so talented that they're able to turn a very simple plot into a comic extravaganza that lasts for about 155 minutes and we never notice time's running. And even when they all arrive into the Santa Rosita park, there's about one hour remaining, but surprises occur at every corner and the comic lot goes over again.The different jokes portrayed on screen vary from the unintentional firing of several firework boxes to the very last one (and most classic one) the legendary banana peel on which we stumble.

He carries the film flawlessly and is without a doubt the most talented actor in the film. Road House for the most part comes across as campy, and filled with gratuitous nudity and violence galore (an absolute eighties action flick to a T.) Despite the moments of gratuity Road House actually supports a fairly strong storyline if not a might predictable and sadly the supporting cast kind of falters against Swayze's strong performance. Nonetheless Road House is a classic for a reason and is the perfect escape film to get your blood pumping and feel good at the end of it.Patrick Swayze leads the cast playing professional cooler (bouncer) Dalton. Swayze is slick and quiet and kind of brooding. He's almost got a Clint Eastwood type persona where you know anyone who crosses him is gonna get an ass kicking and that's exactly what happens with style and grace. Swayze moved like a master when it came to Martial Arts and dancing in those days and this shows off his action skills. He is the only one in this cast who doesn't come across as campy and rather empty. His character has depth and importance and he carries the film. Kelly Lynch plays the eighties gal, Dalton's love interest Dr. Clay. One minute she seems so empty and annoying and then a couple of times she really lets loose a decent performance. Overall though she was hired because she's blonde and gets naked on cue. Sam Elliott looks very tough and plays a good role as Swayze's mentor Wade Garrett. Unfortunately he's not really utilized enough and we don't really get a good feel on him until it's too late. Still he does decent in his role, second best performance to Swayze. Ben Gazzara plays bad guy, family boss Brad Wesley. He's alright as a enemy to Swayze but he's very campy and never really scary but more annoying. The stuff he does to Swayze just makes him look like a scared little kid and he ends up meeting a brutal end. I think a better actor could have made for a terrific adversary.Road House takes on an unusual story about bouncers and gives them a very real existence and you fall in love with their story. It's a story about bravery and friendship and struggles and a fight breaks out every five minutes which gives you enough action to keep you happy. It's exactly everything that eighties classics are known for and that's why it's a must see and it truly is entertaining. Director Rowdy Herrington kind of lucked out I think in doing this film because it's just one of those things that became a cult phenomenon and in one hand you wonder why and in the other you can't help but love it.

I'm just being exceptionally brutal because this film had so much potential, but it lost itself in a swamp of modernist absurdism which doesn't have a point. This is yet another film where the director chooses style over substance. The result is two hrs of gimmicky schlock which will intrigue the film school teachers, but those of us who are looking for a fulfilling literary experience (poetry, plot, theme, etc) will be highly disappointed.SCRIPT There are basically 10 lines of dialogue which are repeated a dozen times each. Count how many times someone says, Beloved is the man who sits down. Literally about 12. Well, that's one Swedish phrase that's been etched into my brain for no good reason. Honestly I haven't heard so much repetition since the last time I sang 99 bottle of beer on the wall round the campfire.VISUALS The entire film has a very drab, bleached white appearance which makes you want to smack the side of your VCR a few times. Yes, this is just another gimmick which is initially novel, but it gets old after 45 minutes of the same thing. Also, each scene was filmed entirely in one shot. Usually I consider that to be a huge plus (e.g. Alfred Hitchcock's Rope, Bela Tarr's Werckmeister Harmoniak). But in this case it was too obvious and excruciatingly dull. Rope and Werckmeister worked well with the continuous shot because the camera was dynamic and fluid, much like the human eye. But in this film the camera only moves once in the entire picture, so there are no dynamics at all. Combine this with the aforementioned bleached-white lack of contrast and shadow, and the result makes you feel like you're a security guard watching a video monitor at the mall. For 2 hours.MUSIC To all you ABBA fans, don't get your hopes up. It's true that Benny did the soundtrack for this film, but that only consists of about 4 chords and 12 notes played on a cheap synthesizer. It ain't no Dancing Queen that's for sure.HUMOUR This movie is so thick with situational sarcasm that I couldn't tell where the gags were. In that sense it is indeed like Monty Python (which others have pointed out), but--make no mistake!--this refers to the mood only. There are no funny lines in this film. So just imagine watching a Monty Python flick with the sound turned down, and there you have it. Not exactly a laugh riot anymore, is it?HIGHLIGHTS So what's left to like about it? I'll tell you what it's just plain different. It's so different that it managed to hold my attention all the way through, as I was hoping that there would be some sort of payoff.

And this smile, coupled with Reginas evil chuckle throughout the movie makes me wonder just why the Davis Diva didn't deliver the 'money moment' accompanied by this deliciously evil smile. Wyler and Davis' fights over the interpretation of the character of Regina Giddens are legendary, and indeed the reason they never worked together again. Could this be a result of one such spate? And if so, just who won out? But I'm being pedantic. I'm also digressing and off on a tangent, which I shall come back from now. Lillian Hellman and her writings have come under much scrutiny, and too often for her outspoken political comment and left-of-centre lifestyle. But two academic comparisons of her dramatic (and subsequent film) scripts that spring to mind are those of parallels to that master of morals and realism, Henrik Ibsen; another with Classic Greek Tragedy. Both Mr Ibsen and Mr Aristophanes were concerned with the greater common good and of mans inhumanity to man. And Hellman does not let us down on this one. Davis and cast deliver one of the most spectacular ensemble performances in cinematic history with a tale of avarice and greed that can apply to any of the so called Globalized corporations of today. Davis and her colleagues can be seen as early prophets of todays greed and selfishness in society, and we could easily lose the period costumes and transpose this story into modern times. Hellman could easily have been predicting the horrors and terrors of the current global drug companies and their willingness to let millions of Africans die of AIDS due to lack of much needed medicines....just as Regina Giddens sits quietly by and watches her husband Horace die of a heart attack rather than climb the stairs to get his drugs for him.

On Tin Cup he couldn't be told that a scene of him beating a security guard to a bloody pulp because he forgot his ID card wasn't going to endear him to the audience in a romcom (I never saw the finished film, but I believe the preview audiences succeeded in getting that scene cut). In The Postman he couldn't be told that ending a film with a statue of him being unveiled was really not a good idea. At all. And in Thirteen Days he couldn't be told that adopting a Boston accent was not a good idea when it makes him sound just like Elmer Fudd. For the first quarter of an hour you're just waiting for him to say Be wewwy, wewwy qwuiet. I'm hunting Wussian Miss-eyells. So it's a testament to the strength of the film that it survives that hurdle and emerges as a gripping thriller even though we all know the ending.Although Costner gets top billing, the film really belongs to Bruce Greenwood and Steven Culp as JFK and Bobby Kennedy, avoiding impersonation (and the accent) to give quite superb performances. While the film is occasionally guilty of overglamorizing the dynamic duo, it's surprising to see just how little control they were able to exercise over the Chiefs of Staff who seemed hell-bent on escalating the Cuban Missile Crisis into a full-scale invasion. Considering the final result, it seems particularly timely now to see a drama about a president desperate to avoid a pointless war over weapons of mass destruction that he knew DID exist at a time when we have a president who was desperate to start a pointless war over weapons that he knew DIDN'T exist for all the corruption, spin and dilettantism of the Kennedy administration, this was one of those fortuitous examples of the right leader at the right time.The film certainly manages to pull off the rare achievement of instilling a real sense of pride not in action but in diplomacy, with most of the drama taking place in conference rooms (although there are a couple of genuinely exciting pieces of film-making in the spy flights over Cuba). Indeed, perhaps the most genuinely stirring moment is Adlai Stevenson calling the Russian ambassador's bluff at the UN, the sort of thing which doesn't exactly pull in the kids at the multiplex. This doesn't always pay dividends, however. The biggest problem is that it loses tension by being so confined to the political and military players there's no sense of the very real fear that spread throughout the world that this really was IT and that the mushroom clouds would start sprouting any minute. As a result the movie does begin to lose its grip towards the end, and doesn't entirely dodge mawkishness. The sporadic early shifts from color to black and white are a real failure, too. With the archive footage in color, there simply seems no reason for them, and they seem to have been thrown in arbitrarily purely to give it an imagined cutting edge. Still, they're fairly minor flaws in an impressive thriller.

Hopkins has never been better - and while it is easy to see how his portrayal of Hannibal Lecter won him his Oscar, this portrayal of the emotionally repressed butler, who refuses to see what is before his eyes is a better example of acting by far. The word, I think, has to be mind-blowing.There is a scene with Emma Thompson, where she teases and taunts him, eventually prising the book he has been shielding from his hand only to see that he has been reading an old-fashioned romance, rather than the joked off racy book, wherein Hopkins says almost nothing, but his eyes and his body language are so expressive that it's almost hard to breath. To perform this well, you have to be matched by an equal talent - and Hopkins and Thompson had already proved their ability to play an equal game in the previous year's Howard's End. Here, Thompson plays a woman who keeps pushing gently and decorously to elicit a response from the repressed Mr Stevens. Her final push (announcing her engagement to another man) and her defiant, heart-broken reaction to Hopkins' studied non-reaction is a great moment. It's a brilliant film. Fantastic screenplay from a terrific novel and masterclass performances - and for those who fear such things, there is no swooning adoration of lacy thrills or male musculature that is something of a feature of other Merchant Ivory films. Ugliness is allowed into the beautiful house where most of the action is set - and it's a bigger, better, more engaging film for that. Unforgettable.

The coach (Gene Hackman) picks a lineup that excels in every way, a group he's had his eye on for quite some time (which really makes no sense if you think about it and realize where he's picking people from, but ignore that).I think there's nothing about the plot an the twists that aren't completely predictable. I've seen many movies like this before and probably will again in the future. The only difference here was the cast.Keanu Reeves delivered a less than stellar performance. He has been known to have good roles (I really enjoyed The Lake House), but he is also known as a really bad actor, and this role really added to the latter. Gene Hackman is a final actor, and was fine in this role... unfortunately it didn't require him to do much besides wear a suit and hat that were forty years out of date.The cheerleaders were, well, decent. Many people have said the cheerleaders are hot (and are supposed to be because of some of the questionable scenes and the fact they're playing ex-strippers). I don't know. The head cheerleader was attractive in a motherly way and one of the cheerleaders was remarkable, but overall they were bland or looked like mental patients. If you're into the dumb blonde thing, maybe they're for you. Personally, I think they could have been written out entirely.The team (besides Reeves) was perfect. The Welsh kicker was interesting and made me want to rent Trainspotting, the Chinese guy was hilarious in his quest to gain more weight. He also set up John Madden for his only good line in the film about a Fat guy dance. (Seriously, does anyone really need to see more John Madden?) The x-con was alright. Orlando Jones had a weak backstory, but he's a goofball actor and is given too much screen time in all his films (please stop giving him roles).Overall, a patterned film that was entertaining but not really one that stands out. I'd even rather watch Varsity Blues if I wanted a football film. This one has heart, but unfortunately lacks originality.
