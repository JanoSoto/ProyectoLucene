I had no idea what this movie was really but there was nothing else on last night and I also noticed that it was directed by Paul Verhoeven which have directed quite a few movies that I really liked so I decided to give it a try. As it turned out, this is another movie that is somewhat above the usual standard for movies given on SyFy.It has a rating on 27% on Rotten Tomatoes which is just bullshit. But then, the so called professional critics used by the Rotten Tomatoes are dimwits who trash every movie that is not intellectual enough for their self-imagined refined tastes. I do not know why they continue to use these clowns for their official rating system instead of the real audience? On IMDb it holds a 5.6 out of 10 rating which is more realistic. I was hesitating between 7 and 6. In the end I gave it a 6 because, as I said in the title, it is a quite okay movie but not a fantastic one.The story of the movie is a fairly standard one. Scientist experiments on himself, experiment goes wrong, scientist goes mad, hack hack, chop chop, scientist dies, happy ending for the remaining survivors. Thus the movie pretty much relies on its special effects which are indeed quite good. The various invisible effects, not to mention the scenes where Caine is partially visible due to smoke or water effects, are quite enjoyable to watch.Kevin Bacon is making quite a performance as a very disagreeable fanatic scientist. He is doing a remarkably good job of it even when he is covered by a latex mask which of course is quite a feat being deprived of any facial expressions. The rest of the cast was fairly standard Hollywood fare, that is, fairly bland.On the whole I found the movie quite enjoyable. It was perhaps a bit slow at the beginning and Cain's show of megalomaniacal attitudes was indeed becoming a bit tiresome after a while. As I said, his roles was a very disagreeable one. Once he became invisible things started to become more interesting although it took a wee time for things to speed up even then.It was certainly not a wasted movie evening and the movie is worth at least 6 out of 10 stars.

But even his disappointments I find are not that terrible, certainly in comparison to the worst of other directors' resumes. The Trouble with Harry for me may fall short of being one of his top 10 films(Psycho, Vertigo, Rear Window, Rebecca, Notorious, The Lady Vanishes, Strangers on a Train, Shadow of a Doubt, North By Northwest and The Birds) and it is one that seems to divide audiences, but it is nowhere near among his weakest like Jamaica Inn, Topaz, Under Capricorn and The Paradine Case. The Trouble with Harry does come across as pedestrian pace-wise sometimes, but even if people don't like it(and that is absolutely fine) I do find it difficult to believe personally that they'd give it a score that indicates that it has no redeeming values, then again that may be just me.Dissenting opinions, saying that the film is not funny and that it has no plot, and that it was a flop at the box office might indicate for some that The Trouble with Harry is not a great film. I think a large part of why was how it was promoted\/marketed. Anybody thinking it would be a murder mystery and that it would have suspense like Hitchcock's master of suspense nickname suggests will be disappointed, and I don't think it helped that Paramount clearly didn't know how to promote it. The Trouble with Harry is an acquired taste and I wouldn't go as far to say it's perfect, but to me it is an example of a film that succeeds at being different. Besides, how a film did at the box office or how much money has made has never been an overriding factor in how I judge films anyway, it isn't a fair criticism and there are many examples of films that made lots of money but actually aren't that good.The Trouble with Harry is really well-made for a start. The cinematography is wholly professional and sometimes has a dream-like look to it. The scenery is a genuine beauty, and I'd go as far to say that The Trouble with Harry is one of Hitch's most visually pleasing films. Hitchcock splendidly directs, the opening sequence was a truly great touch and set the scene of the film really well, sure it is different to what he is known for, but there is the odd suspenseful moment. And there are those suspenseful moments you can tell that it is Hitch directing, which is more than I can say for something like Jamaica Inn or Under Capricorn where I was struggling to tell where it was Hitchcock directing or not. Bernard Hermann would do even better later with Psycho and especially Vertigo but the music score for The Trouble with Harry is still an atmospheric one that does a fine job fitting with the film.I'll also say that I am one of those who did find The Trouble with Harry very funny, often hilarious. Black humour works wonders when done right, and the black humour I found was done right here. It is very wry and deliciously ironic, also with some of the one-liners with Edmund Gwenn and Mildred Natwick quite ahead-of-its-time. Some will find the story plot-less with not much of a point, compared to other Hitchcock films that is true as there are more tautly written stories. However the story here while somewhat odd is clever and I did love how dramatically understated it was. The characters are disparate and will not come across as very likable to people, but like with the subtle storytelling and understated drama to keep them like that- and to have them spending the time thinking who did it? and did I do it?- was a deliberate choice and one that came off very nicely. The most endearing character is Miss Graveley, closely followed by Arnie.From an acting point of view, The Trouble with Harry is as excellent as the humour. Dwight Marfield is a little wooden, but it is not enough to harm anything and doesn't stick out too much like a sore thumb to everybody else. It is better to judge John Forsythe on his own, rather than comparing him to the likes of Cary Grant and James Stewart. His performance won't be up there with one of the greatest in a Hitchcock film, but his ruggedly handsome looks, subtle comic delivery and quiet intelligence makes it an above decent one. Shirley MacLaine was in her film debut, and it is a very charming and sweet(but not overly-so) debut indeed, again like Forsythe she works better being judged in her own way as well. Their chemistry is convincing enough, but that between Gwenn and Natwick was stronger. Mildreds Natwick and Dunnock are very easy to like and seem to be thoroughly enjoying themselves, while Jerry Mathers is similarly likable(and cute). I found Edmund Gwenn to be the one who dominated though and in a good way, he has brilliant comic timing and is very commanding and cool, it really helps that he has the best lines along with Natwick(their chemistry was adorable).Overall, really good, even great, film that shouldn't be dismissed so quickly. 9\/10 Bethany Cox ","genre":null},{"date":"8 May 2013","score":"","review":" While Alfred Hitchcock is my favourite director, I am not going to say that he hasn't made a disappointing film(and actually I haven't come across that many Hitch fans that have said that).

Dwight Marfield is a little wooden, but it is not enough to harm anything and doesn't stick out too much like a sore thumb to everybody else. It is better to judge John Forsythe on his own, rather than comparing him to the likes of Cary Grant and James Stewart. His performance won't be up there with one of the greatest in a Hitchcock film, but his ruggedly handsome looks, subtle comic delivery and quiet intelligence makes it an above decent one. Shirley MacLaine was in her film debut, and it is a very charming and sweet(but not overly-so) debut indeed, again like Forsythe she works better being judged in her own way as well. Their chemistry is convincing enough, but that between Gwenn and Natwick was stronger. Mildreds Natwick and Dunnock are very easy to like and seem to be thoroughly enjoying themselves, while Jerry Mathers is similarly likable(and cute). I found Edmund Gwenn to be the one who dominated though and in a good way, he has brilliant comic timing and is very commanding and cool, it really helps that he has the best lines along with Natwick(their chemistry was adorable).Overall, really good, even great, film that shouldn't be dismissed so quickly. 9\/10 Bethany Cox ","genre":"Comedy, Mystery"},{"date":"8 May 2013","score":"","review":" While Alfred Hitchcock is my favourite director, I am not going to say that he hasn't made a disappointing film(and actually I haven't come across that many Hitch fans that have said that). But even his disappointments I find are not that terrible, certainly in comparison to the worst of other directors' resumes. The Trouble with Harry for me may fall short of being one of his top 10 films(Psycho, Vertigo, Rear Window, Rebecca, Notorious, The Lady Vanishes, Strangers on a Train, Shadow of a Doubt, North By Northwest and The Birds) and it is one that seems to divide audiences, but it is nowhere near among his weakest like Jamaica Inn, Topaz, Under Capricorn and The Paradine Case. The Trouble with Harry does come across as pedestrian pace-wise sometimes, but even if people don't like it(and that is absolutely fine) I do find it difficult to believe personally that they'd give it a score that indicates that it has no redeeming values, then again that may be just me.Dissenting opinions, saying that the film is not funny and that it has no plot, and that it was a flop at the box office might indicate for some that The Trouble with Harry is not a great film. I think a large part of why was how it was promoted\/marketed. Anybody thinking it would be a murder mystery and that it would have suspense like Hitchcock's master of suspense nickname suggests will be disappointed, and I don't think it helped that Paramount clearly didn't know how to promote it. The Trouble with Harry is an acquired taste and I wouldn't go as far to say it's perfect, but to me it is an example of a film that succeeds at being different. Besides, how a film did at the box office or how much money has made has never been an overriding factor in how I judge films anyway, it isn't a fair criticism and there are many examples of films that made lots of money but actually aren't that good.The Trouble with Harry is really well-made for a start. The cinematography is wholly professional and sometimes has a dream-like look to it. The scenery is a genuine beauty, and I'd go as far to say that The Trouble with Harry is one of Hitch's most visually pleasing films. Hitchcock splendidly directs, the opening sequence was a truly great touch and set the scene of the film really well, sure it is different to what he is known for, but there is the odd suspenseful moment. And there are those suspenseful moments you can tell that it is Hitch directing, which is more than I can say for something like Jamaica Inn or Under Capricorn where I was struggling to tell where it was Hitchcock directing or not. Bernard Hermann would do even better later with Psycho and especially Vertigo but the music score for The Trouble with Harry is still an atmospheric one that does a fine job fitting with the film.I'll also say that I am one of those who did find The Trouble with Harry very funny, often hilarious. Black humour works wonders when done right, and the black humour I found was done right here. It is very wry and deliciously ironic, also with some of the one-liners with Edmund Gwenn and Mildred Natwick quite ahead-of-its-time. Some will find the story plot-less with not much of a point, compared to other Hitchcock films that is true as there are more tautly written stories. However the story here while somewhat odd is clever and I did love how dramatically understated it was. The characters are disparate and will not come across as very likable to people, but like with the subtle storytelling and understated drama to keep them like that- and to have them spending the time thinking who did it? and did I do it?- was a deliberate choice and one that came off very nicely.

He is a stylish director, using kinetic, frantic camera movements to both advance plot and visually please the audience. Unfortunately, here he completely drops the ball and is unable to string together the narrative of what is one of the most basic and re-told stories in American movies.Sharon Stone is the lone gunslinger who wanders into town with an apparent grudge against its' head gangster, Gene Hackman. Hackman chews the scenery like he is back on the set of Superman and is clearly having a blast, Stone on the other hand is so woefully miscast that it is just embarrassing. She never for a moment convinces us that she is anything more than a Hollywood princess playing dress up and when she has to square up to Hackman it is like watching a teenager throw a temper tantrum. Stone doesn't realise the director thinks he is making a comedy, which is something she probably should have cleared up with him as she, in her role as producer, hired him. Russell Crowe is underwhelming as the bad guy turned good and he can't hide that Ozzie accent. Leonardo DiCaprio rounds out the key players and he is fine as the young brash wannabe legend, showing that movie star charisma and handsome smile that would define him for a generation of teenage girls a few years later. He is also responsible for the films only real moment of humanity. Lance Henriksen, Woody Strode and Mark Boone Junior are among the supporting players who fail to make any kind of impact due to the lousy script and direction so flimsy the film seems to lunge from one scene to the next with no sense of purpose or vision.The plot revolves around a shooting competition in which the contestants 'draw' on each other upon the strike of the clock tower bell. This gives Raimi plenty of opportunity to showcase some unusual and potentially exciting visuals but he is unable to inject any tension into the proceedings. Leone can make us feel the tension even when we know the outcome, whereas when watching The Quick and the Dead I found myself with one eye on the clock like one of the characters in the movie.Lastly, I'll mention Alan Silvestri's score, which is routine and dull.

A very intricate film that the viewer has to pay close attention too. I like how Kubrick pieces scenes together which all eventually form into one major storyline. It has a good mix of mystery and action. I Also like how it takes place at a raceway instead of a bank it is an untypical heist. It has a lot of planning behind as well as side stories for each of the characters. Showing you the story from each characters point of view.

Al must have mingled with the right circles on the comedy scene, though, because an odd blend of before-they-weres fill out UHF's cast Fran Drescher, Victoria Jackson and an especially hyperactive, scene-stealing Michael Richards would all go on to bigger things later in life.

What this film does is amazing, it takes you through one man's journey from a young man, whose outlook on life is like any other at a young age, to someone whose hate is fueled by the unfortunate death of a loved onto him trying to save another loved one to a similar fate. Each and every performance is significant, from the small, but effective roles portrayed by Fairuza Balk and Ethan Suplee, as members of the DOS that Norton's character at the start of the film has brought together, as kind of a new age Nazi regime. The two performances in the film to really look at here goes to Norton and Furlong themselves, the characters are both shown to be bright individuals despite their obvious ignorance and as we get to know them, we begin to really want them to succeed in a turn around. Of course, with Norton's character we see him already changed, trying to put the pieces of his family back together, due to his actions in the past and its through flashbacks we get to see his turnaround. Another performance that should thrown out there is by Guy Torry, who plays Norton's cell mate of sorts(they don't share a cell, but they have the same work duty), his character is likable and he manages to make you feel like your there in the film helping him to turn Norton around. The main focus of the movie starts out with Furlong's character on the verge of becoming the hateful clone that his brother was locked up for going too far with, while we see him as a caring member of the family, its hard to see his ignorance come out, simply due to skin color and feeling that society is now so focused on being equal they are screwing over the white race, which as a white person living in the projects, I can relate(although, I don't grow any hate over it). Edward Furlong does a phenomenal job in this film, although, they look nothing alike, you really feel they were brothers with a tight bond. Another aspect of the film that really sends a great message is how the story the told in present time, with the flashbacks being told in black & white, it keeps the film feeling surreal, while still giving you the message the scene is trying to get out, with the most effective scene coming in the form of what ultimately got Norton landed in jail and what Furlong is thinking of when he finally has his turnaround. Although, I put in that there are spoilers in this review, I think its best you watch this film to see how the ending plays out, its an unexpected and very non-cliché. One that will have you watching through the credits as you wrap your mind around what you just watched. 5 out of 5 stars I will also have to note that this film has never gotten a decent DVD release, no commentary, no featurettes, nothing. The studio needs to wake up and give us something like that.
