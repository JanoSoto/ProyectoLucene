With revolutionary effects, great fight scenes and just a story on an epic scale, A New Hope is just one film that you will not forget easily and one that can make you fall in love with Star Wars. I liked even the actors who basically were all starting out and I found the movie to be strongly an amazing film, and here below is why so.The story is just so massive but in a 2 hour film, a lot of things go on but all things are resolved well to say it is just this one film with a lot of plot points. The story is also very interesting and you can't help but feel if you miss anything then you should rewind and see what happened because it can get a grip on you. The action quota is pretty good to say it isn't all about that kind of stuff, some great gun battles, space fights and of course the legendary lightsaber battles.Mark Hamill is just young Luke Skywalker in this and although he never takes the role to new heights in cinema, he still solidly commands it and never puts a step wrong. For me the real hit of this film is Harrison Ford as Han Solo with his cool persona yet also very edgy when aggravated, he delivers a performance that basically eclipses that of the main man Skywalker. Carey Fisher is good as Princess Leia and Alec Guinness also in his finest role in his older age, just shows how well some can act in Sci-Fi which is never seen to be always that well award winningly acted.George Lucas is just awesome in making this film with it's directing and writing and setting into motion a critically crazy franchise of films, he directs it perfectly and no other person could have made this even a little bit better, it is what it is. He also delivers so well on the screenplay and the actors say there lines with complete ease and how you would expect them to do it. The effects are just so brilliant for 1977 and work even in the future with modern effects, just beautiful sets to look at completely. If any criticism comes it's way, well, there isn't much to pick out if truth be told and if they are they are minor. I didn't think the film was perfect even if this review seems like I did so far and the reason I didn't is mainly because of the maybe slower parts toward the end of the movie where it can seem as if you have been worn out by all the things going but in all cases you shouldn't dislike it for doing that.If you want possibly the best Sci-Fi film ever then this is a true contender and to say I didn't find this flawless yet I did think it sensational then it goes to show how much more some will love this if they haven't already viewed it. I guess those who should stay away is anyone who hates an epic space drama really if that makes any real sense, you get the stereotypical people where one hates Star Wars and never wants to hear of it ever again after watching it and the other is in absolute love with it.Overall I found it Strongly a Sublime piece of cinema history and one I think will never be forgotten in the tapestry that is film. You know a lot of people see Star Wars fans as nerdy but I think anyone can love this even if they are not mega fans afterwards or anything like that, it is just good fun all round. Oh and one more thing to add is the comedy, the film is actually very funny in certain parts and really mixes up beautifully to create legendary movie.

Ir made me think about what his heaven would be like, if he was watching his family grieve and I hope he's found peace. This film hits home for a lot of us, obviously because Robin killed himself. I don't believe people who commit suicide out of sadness or loss of hope go to hell, I believe they go to heaven like everyone else - Maybe that's just me being idealistic. As a film though, this moved me a lot. It was quite a sad film but at the same time there were moments of joy and sweetness. The acting was superb. I've never seen Robin act in this kind of role and I think it brought out his gentle, loving side people who knew him often spoke about. He spoke with this fascinating softness that makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside.I feel he should be more well know for this role because its a great film. Annabella was also brilliant , she really brought out the raw emotion and pain a widow goes through after not only losing her children but then her husband. Although Cuba played a small part in this, his was also a great piece of acting (I wouldn't expect anything less from him). I cried a lot through this film, all for various reasons including the death of Robin and that pain of seeing him being wonderful and I am really going to miss him, also the film was very moving and does make you think, it also made me think of my life and what I'd do if certain people tragically left my life. So it hit home on quite a few levels. For its time the CG is actually pretty good, I've seen worse CG in films nowadays.

I'm sure in 1975 everything in this film would have been out of nowhere and nonsense. After seeing a movie like Anchorman, it's hard to say I laughed as much because Anchorman is so much more out there. It outdoes this film. But regardless, I appreciate this film, as I appreciate Monty Python, because I know it did a lot for comedy. Without it, there'd probably be no Anchorman as we know it.GOODThe WRITING is good. Even for a nonsense comedy, it creates some likable characters and interesting scenarios. JOKES ARE PROPERLY SET-UP and even though the film essentially uses the set-up-punchline by scene formula rather than focusing heavily on a story, everything feels relevant enough (unlike a 100 Hundred Ways to Die in the West or whatever that movie was called).The ACTING is great. Not much to say, but you never feel like your watching an actor. While the COMEDY is aged from what I saw, it still had some very funny moments.

When I first saw this movie on TV, I hated it and feel bad for Lea Thompson and George Lucas who happens to be one of my favorite filmmakers gets to be an executive producer of this movie. As time went by, I gave this movie another look on Netflix and I started to laugh at for some reason. After watching it, I thought the movie wasn't that bad, but its by no means a good movie and I do see other movies that are very much worse than Howard the Duck. I did have a fun time watching this movie by making fun of it. For me, this is one of those movies that I has to be seen to be believe that no one like George Lucas would get involved in this, and get his friends that worked with him on his second feature film American Graffiti. Willard Huyck co-wrote and directed the movie, while his wife Gloria Katz produces and co-write it. The movie is based on a Marvel comic book that was created by Steve Gerber, and it was Marvel's first movie; everything about this movie does have some weird elements like a female duck in a bathtub showing off her breast, which it is not real nudity and you have a condom that happens to be in Howard's wallet along with Thompson's character trying to make out with Howard in bed. Everyone who have seen this movie cannot make up their minds if this movie is intended for kids or adults. I have read some of the comics, and to me as I agree with Thompson's comment about the movie that comics were very much for adults (No I don't mean showing nudity or anything like that I mean for its own kind of bizarre type of humor). Parents that have bought this movie on VHS OR DVD are going to think that this is a kids movie, which it is not because no one is familiar with Howard the Duck because they have never read the comics; it is rated PG but I think it should have been either R or PG-13. With that said, I thought Lea Thompson has done a great job for her role a Beverly Switzler, and for also doing most of her signing work. Jeffery Jones is over the top, but seems to be having for playing the villain as the Dark Overlord of the Universe. Tim Robbins in this movie was just pretty much overacting, but I have gotten used to him. The special effects by ILM was not really that bad because I have seen movies that have bad special effects. The duck suit itself that everyone keeps talking about looks fake; to me, I thought it looked okay, and I thought the special effects team and the rest of the film crew did tried to put their best effort to bring Howard come to life in live-action form instead of an animated feature as what they originally were going for (It was Universal's idea for live action, watch the features on the special edition DVD's extra feature). They can't used CGI because this movie was made in the 80s, and there is nothing more that you can expect. Of course, the animatronics would have been better if they took it to Stan Winston or Jim Henson for creating the duck suit or this movie could have been made years later so they would make Howard CG, which it would have made a better movie. Speaking of the duck suit, I thought the stop motion animation for the Dark Overlord looks kind of cool, and Phil Tippet does a fine job with the look of the Dark Overlord. Of course, it may look cheesy but I think it does add a charm to it by just providing a B movie feel. The music by John Barry was very good, and I think the songs by Thomas Dolby were also good too. My favorites are Hunger City; Don't Turn Away (Both Dolby's and Thompson's); and the Howard the Duck theme. The movie doesn't feel boring, but I do think the pacing of this movie goes by pretty well. Overall, it may be bad, but I really enjoy it. Howard the Duck really deserves to be seen, and it depends on whether you think this movie is either underrated or just so bad its really good. If you think this movie stinks, so be it. For me, I enjoy watching this movie on how bad it is and really am going to have fun time as I just turn off my brain for some entertainment. Mindless entertainment as what I mean. I give this movie an 8 out of 10.

The movie is based on a Marvel comic book that was created by Steve Gerber, and it was Marvel's first movie; everything about this movie does have some weird elements like a female duck in a bathtub showing off her breast, which it is not real nudity and you have a condom that happens to be in Howard's wallet along with Thompson's character trying to make out with Howard in bed. Everyone who have seen this movie cannot make up their minds if this movie is intended for kids or adults. I have read some of the comics, and to me as I agree with Thompson's comment about the movie that comics were very much for adults (No I don't mean showing nudity or anything like that I mean for its own kind of bizarre type of humor). Parents that have bought this movie on VHS OR DVD are going to think that this is a kids movie, which it is not because no one is familiar with Howard the Duck because they have never read the comics; it is rated PG but I think it should have been either R or PG-13. With that said, I thought Lea Thompson has done a great job for her role a Beverly Switzler, and for also doing most of her signing work. Jeffery Jones is over the top, but seems to be having for playing the villain as the Dark Overlord of the Universe. Tim Robbins in this movie was just pretty much overacting, but I have gotten used to him. The special effects by ILM was not really that bad because I have seen movies that have bad special effects. The duck suit itself that everyone keeps talking about looks fake; to me, I thought it looked okay, and I thought the special effects team and the rest of the film crew did tried to put their best effort to bring Howard come to life in live-action form instead of an animated feature as what they originally were going for (It was Universal's idea for live action, watch the features on the special edition DVD's extra feature). They can't used CGI because this movie was made in the 80s, and there is nothing more that you can expect. Of course, the animatronics would have been better if they took it to Stan Winston or Jim Henson for creating the duck suit or this movie could have been made years later so they would make Howard CG, which it would have made a better movie. Speaking of the duck suit, I thought the stop motion animation for the Dark Overlord looks kind of cool, and Phil Tippet does a fine job with the look of the Dark Overlord. Of course, it may look cheesy but I think it does add a charm to it by just providing a B movie feel. The music by John Barry was very good, and I think the songs by Thomas Dolby were also good too. My favorites are Hunger City; Don't Turn Away (Both Dolby's and Thompson's); and the Howard the Duck theme. The movie doesn't feel boring, but I do think the pacing of this movie goes by pretty well. Overall, it may be bad, but I really enjoy it. Howard the Duck really deserves to be seen, and it depends on whether you think this movie is either underrated or just so bad its really good. If you think this movie stinks, so be it. For me, I enjoy watching this movie on how bad it is and really am going to have fun time as I just turn off my brain for some entertainment. Mindless entertainment as what I mean. I give this movie an 8 out of 10.

When I first saw this movie on TV, I hated it and feel bad for Lea Thompson and George Lucas who happens to be one of my favorite filmmakers gets to be an executive producer of this movie. As time went by, I gave this movie another look on Netflix and I started to laugh at for some reason. After watching it, I thought the movie wasn't that bad, but its by no means a good movie and I do see other movies that are very much worse than Howard the Duck. I did have a fun time watching this movie by making fun of it. For me, this is one of those movies that I has to be seen to be believe that no one like George Lucas would get involved in this, and get his friends that worked with him on his second feature film American Graffiti.

Dickey states in his novel that one day, the American wilderness will soon expired because of the technology that we have today. He states that the rivers and streams in the wild is very useful to our environment. Even after Dickey's passing, we still today struggle through this hardship. The fact that in today's world, the environment is still hanging in the balance.The movie version of the bestseller is a perfectly great example of his theory. Four Atlanta businessmen, Ed, (Jon Voight), Lewis, (Burt Reynolds), Drew, (Ronny Cox), and Bobby, (Ned Beatty), are spending their weekend canoeing down an Georgia river that will soon turn into a lake, thanks to the local power company damming the river. The four men all come from different backgrounds and perspectives. Ed is a mild- mannered everyday man who has a wife, a kid and a profession he enjoys. Lewis is a outdoors-man. He is very concerned by the fact that the river is turning into a lake. He even has his philosophy about machines taking over the land that America sits on. Drew is a very deeply moral person. He doesn't seem to bother anybody since he spends most of his time playing his guitar. Bobby is a lovable, sometimes clumsy person who seems to have a big heart. In the beginning of their canoe trip, the group tries to communicate with the locals by telling them that they want someone to drive their cars down to Aintry, which is the closest town near the river. The folks, however, are not very friendly. Some are inbred, while other suffered from the living conditions.After settling in, the boys decides to canoe down the river and along the way, they run into a pair of backwoods men. One of them is a mountain man, (Bill McKinney), who turns the movie into a very sinister adventure film. As the canoe trip becomes more and more dangerous to handle, the boys find themselves in constant danger after committing an murder in the woods since one of the mountain man raped Bobby. The cinematography of the movie is very beautifully done by Vilmos Zsigmond. He does know how to photograph unfake shots of the mountains and especially the white water. The whole movie is very well- photographed since the movie has a very deceiving look of the wilderness. It also as if there's something evil lurking under something beautiful. It always nice to see a movie where there's an authentic look and feel of nature itself. Even though some people never went canoeing down a river, this is a perfect example what could happen when you travel through the rapids and the jagged rocks that are in the river.One of the best scenes in Deliverance is when Drew and a local boy feud against each other with their musical instruments. Drew is strumming his guitar, peacefully. The local boy, with a very dark look on his stoned face, plucks on one of his strings on his banjo. This scene is famously called Dueling Banjos, since the music involves shows the contrasts of city life and country life. Of course, that is very significant in the movie. But never done quite like this before. The attitude that the boys have on the locals is another example of the city life\/country life contrast. Lewis seems to taunt the locals by instigating them. But, even with his wisecracks, Lewis doesn't seem to realize that he could wound up being hurt if he doesn't close his mouth.Ever since Deliverance was released, people had mixed feelings toward the way the locals were represented in the movie. Billy Redden, who plays the banjo player, said that he enjoyed working on the movie and said that it is just a movie. Yet some locals thinks the movie is an insult to those who live in deep Georgia. In my opinion, a movie is a movie. I doubt that the makers of this movie were creating a land that was slipping away at the time. In fact, there are a lot of ideas that Deliverance has to offer.Several critics stated that the movie is an allegory of the Vietnam War. To some, that is a very interesting point because according to Lewis, the boys, not knowing that they going into uncharted territory, are raping the land. They have no idea what they are about to get into. That statement can be made about the ongoing Vietnam War that was going on at that time. And besides, the unforgettable climax of the movie is a example of what the American soldiers experienced while coming to America. The fact that Ed, suffers from what happened on the river. Not only Ed, but Lewis, Bobby and even Drew.Out of all of the movies that Burt Reynolds starred in, this is his best. This movie is long before he starred in Smokey and the Bandit in 1977. His performance in Deliverance is great and also interesting because you think that they would hired an different actor to play Lewis. But, Reynolds is outstanding. He doesn't grandstand or overact his part. He plays Lewis very sharp. Jon Voight, who at the time was struggling to become a serious actor is very well-casted in this movie. To me, Voight plays Ed in a very mild-mannered way. He is very open- minded especially in a scene where the boys talk about what they are going to do with the body. Voight in that scene holds himself back while the others try to figure out what to do. The two lesser known actors, Ronny Cox and Ned Beatty, did a very good job. Beatty is perfect as Bobby, the clumsy and always cheerful businessman. ★★★★ 4 stars.

Obviously it has inspired numerous sequels and remakes, and its influence in film and American culture is undeniably great. But taken on its own merits, is there anything truly magnificent about The Magnificent Seven? By all standards, it's competently made, but it surprisingly lacks in two key areas character development and exciting action sequences.The Magnificent Seven (itself a Western remake of the 1954 film, Seven Samurai) is about a team of seven Americans that are hired to defend a small Mexican town from bandits, who have repeatedly returned to pillage the town over the years. The seven Americans quickly realize they are outnumbered, so they must also train the town to fight.As previously mentioned, there are two major problems with The Magnificent Seven. The first of which is character development. The film has seven primary characters, and while some are faithfully developed (primarily Chico, a hot-headed youngster), most of the other characters are given little defining traits or dimensions. I would argue that only two or three of the seven protagonists are given personalities with any kind of depth. The other four are given a single notable feature (one is on the run, one is good with a knife) to support their presence. If nothing else, the villain, Calvera, is entertaining to watch, even if he is drawn equally thin.The other big problem is the ineffectiveness of the action sequences. They fail to raise one's pulse, and though the finale does seem to have genuine stakes (and actually follows through on its risks), it lacks any element of fun. Given the serious circumstances, one could forgive the lack of joy involved, but there is little tension or even thrill to compensate for this.There are a small number of other issues as well. After the first 80 minutes of the film, The Magnificent Seven begins to drag, and it never really picks back up. As a result, the last 45 minutes seem incredibly long. Also, an unnecessary love story has been shoe-horned in, but isn't developed at all, and finds itself swaying closer to comedy than touching poignancy. While not without memorable moments, there is little of outstanding notability in The Magnificent Seven, excepting its massive legacy. It takes surprising risks with an ending that's more somber and less triumphant than most modern Hollywood endings, and though the characters themselves are lacking in identification, the performances are great.Many of the poorly written characters are saved by strong performances. Admittedly, some do fall prey to melodrama, but they still hold up reasonably well. The standout performance belongs to Horst Buchholz who makes the most of an annoying character, and incidentally, the one that's the most developed. Yul Brynner, who portrays Chris Adams (arguably the leader of the seven) is an intimidating screen presence, despite the fact that he plays a protagonist. The same could be said of James Coburn. The villain portrayed by Eli Wallach is enjoyable to watch, and is certainly the most entertaining cast member.Elmer Bernstein's score is easily the most magnificent element of the film. The main theme is proudly performed in the opening titles (perhaps the best part of the film) and is given several reprises throughout the film. The Mexican influence seeps into the score, allowing for a bit of color in the form of guitar and castanets. The only real problem with the music is the absurd overuse of one particular guitar chord is played on its own at least a dozen times (or more) throughout the film. It's a tad distracting, but it is only a small blemish on an otherwise, highly entertaining score.The Magnificent Seven is a perfectly watchable movie, but it's a long ways off from great, and even a recommendation would feel generous. Had its characters been stronger, and the action sequences more thrilling, The Magnificent Seven could have been something great. Alas, its flaws and slow third act keep this legendary Western from living up to its legacy. It's not bad by any stretch of imagination, but it's a disappointment nonetheless.

Yul Brynner, who portrays Chris Adams (arguably the leader of the seven) is an intimidating screen presence, despite the fact that he plays a protagonist. The same could be said of James Coburn. The villain portrayed by Eli Wallach is enjoyable to watch, and is certainly the most entertaining cast member.Elmer Bernstein's score is easily the most magnificent element of the film. The main theme is proudly performed in the opening titles (perhaps the best part of the film) and is given several reprises throughout the film. The Mexican influence seeps into the score, allowing for a bit of color in the form of guitar and castanets. The only real problem with the music is the absurd overuse of one particular guitar chord is played on its own at least a dozen times (or more) throughout the film. It's a tad distracting, but it is only a small blemish on an otherwise, highly entertaining score.The Magnificent Seven is a perfectly watchable movie, but it's a long ways off from great, and even a recommendation would feel generous. Had its characters been stronger, and the action sequences more thrilling, The Magnificent Seven could have been something great. Alas, its flaws and slow third act keep this legendary Western from living up to its legacy. It's not bad by any stretch of imagination, but it's a disappointment nonetheless.

How was it? It was not the Godzilla that everyone remembers. This is not Godzilla. Today, many people that talk about this movie will refer to the monster as Zilla instead of Godzilla. The monster does appears in Godzilla Final Wars, which it is now being part of the Godzilla universe. With that said, the movie was produced and co-written by Dean Devlin along side co-writer and director Roland Emmerich who has directed movies such as Universal Soldiers; Stargate; The Patriot; The Day After Tomorrow; 10,000 B.C.; 2012; and the classic popcorn entertainment Independence Day. Emmerich has done a horrible job and he should never had directed this movie because he was not fan of any the Godzilla movies. Also, the look of the Godzilla looks nothing like the King of the Monsters that everyone loves and remembers. Oh, the CGI of God...oh, I'm sorry Zilla looks pretty much awful because it looks like that you would see on the Syfy channel. Although, there may be some practical effects but the CGI looks by far the worst. The story itself is horribly written, and some of the jokes don't work for example where Matthew Broderick's character looks at all fishes being putted together in a big pile, and turns to one of the soldiers and said That's a lot of fish. How is that funny? Its not! Oh, even most of the cast that I feel sorry for are very much given a bunch of bad dialogues which makes most of the characters look stupid. I am not counting Matthew Broderick and Jean Reno because they are like the only two characters that I like, but at times might be given a bad direction. Same goes to Maria Pitillo, who is not only given a bad direction but a bad performance. However, I do feel bad for the actress, and I don't think she was that bad. Despite on what I say about giving most of the cast a bunch of bad dialogues and making characters look stupid I do say that the acting in this movie is not bad. I also don't mind the song that played during the movie's end credits Come with Me sung by Puff Daddy featuring Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page. Oh, I also thought spoofing Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert was very unnecessary because Emmerich did that intentionally because Siskel and Ebert never gave their movies a positive review. I know that many directors don't make movies for the critics, but they could at least just respect their opinion on a movie that they criticize on. Also, maybe just deal with criticism that whether he or she accepts it or not. I wish I can go on more about this movie, but everything else that many fans of Godzilla had already pointed out this movie on why this movie sucks. Overall, this is not Godzilla and it is not a fun popcorn entertainment as Independence Day was; but it is not the absolute worst movie of 1998 because I think the Psycho remake is the absolute worst movie of 1998, which I will review it for another time. For right now, stick with the original classic 1954 movie, and some of the other Godzilla movies. Even the 2014 reboot. I give this movie a 2 out of 10.

Their father, who has driven them far into the wilderness for a picnic, suddenly takes out a gun and begins shooting at them. After they run away he sets the car on fire and shoots himself in the head. Lost in the desert, they would seem to have little chance of survival, until they are discovered by an Aboriginal boy. Although he cannot speak any English, and they do not speak a word of his language, they manage to communicate using sign language and the Aborigine uses his tracking and hunting skills to help the children.Although the film was made by an English director, Nicolas Roeg, it was shot in Australia on an Australian theme and can therefore be seen as one of the earliest films of the Australian New Wave of the seventies. Roeg's photography of the outback recalls that of Peter Weir in Picnic at Hanging Rock, perhaps the best-known New Wave film. This was Roeg's second feature film and shows many of the techniques for which he was to become famous, especially extensive cross-cutting and the symbolic use of montage. One of his themes is the contrast between the children's safe, ordered life in Sydney and their ordeal in the desert. The film opens with a brief montage of scenes of the Anglophone city, a place of military parades, of school uniforms, of butcher's shops, of radio broadcasts and of swimming-pools He then reverts to some of these images later in the film; for example, shots of the Aboriginal boy butchering a kangaroo he has killed are intercut with shots of a butcher chopping meat, possibly to indicate that the preparation of food is something fundamental to both cultures. The film is notable for its photography of the landscapes and wildlife of Australia. During the early scenes, when the children are on their own, the bush seems like something alien, harsh and threatening. Later, however, after the Aboriginal boy has joined them, and especially after they discover a lush green oasis, it still seems alien but in a different way. It has now become a place of wonder, of life, even of plenty for those who can understand its secrets. (From a reference to Remembrance Day we learn that the action takes place in November, the Australian spring). The shots of the animals and birds also seem to have symbolic meanings. Creatures like snakes, scorpions, an eagle hovering overhead and a thorny devil seem to symbolise the dangers confronting the siblings, while a possum and a cockatoo in the oasis speak more of nature's bounty. There is much that is mysterious about the film. It is never really explained why the father should have killed himself or have tried to shoot his children, although it is hinted that money troubles may have played a part. It is not explained how the family, originally from Sydney, should have made it so far into the outback. (References to Adelaide suggest that we are now in South Australia). We do not even learn the names of the main characters; they are merely referred to as the girl, the white boy and the black boy. Yet these gaps in our knowledge should not be regarded as goofs or plot holes. They merely add to the air of mystery which is an important part of the film. In his review Roger Ebert described it as being about the mystery of communication, and I think this was a perceptive comment. When it comes to the basics of survival, food and water, the siblings and the Aborigine are able to communicate despite their lack of a common language. When it comes to matters of the heart cultural differences get in the way. In a key scene near the end the Aborigine performs an elaborate dance in front of the girl. She simply interprets this as a strange ritual and tells her brother that this is the Aborigines' way of saying goodbye to people they like, unable to understand that he has fallen in love with her and this is in fact a courtship dance. Difficulties in communication can also arise between people of the same cultural background. At one stage in their wanderings the children find a deserted mining town where they meet an elderly white man but are unable to make him understand they are lost; his only concern is that they are trespassing and might damage company property. To say that Walkabout is simply about communication, or about cultural differences, or survival, or the relationship between Man and Nature, or the clash of urban civilisations with other, older ways of life would be to oversimplify the film, even though it is about all those things and others. It is not a film with a single, obvious meaning, but a hauntingly beautiful, complex cinematic poem in which many meanings can be found each time one sees it. It marked the emergence of the lovely Jenny Agutter as a major star, confirming the promise she had shown in The Railway Children the previous year, and of David Gulpilil as the first Aboriginal film star. Mention should also be made of John Barry's fine musical score. It also marked the arrival of Roeg as a major auteur. Although he has not always fulfilled his early promise, Walkabout is a masterpiece of the cinema.

The thing about Chuckie's 1984-1986 movies were they hit the video circuit only months, after hitting the screen. This pic, a moronic POW Vietnam tale, I now feel embarrassed or ashamed for watching it back in 1986, during my teen years. This prequel was so trashy and bad, not trashy and good.

Packed with sincere performances from its young but terrific cast, this film's real strength lies in the right balance it finds in each of its filmmaking aspects & the manner in which it captures the time that memories are made of.Based on a Stephen King's novella & told in flashback by a writer recounting his boyhood journey after learning of his friend's demise, Stand By Me is set in the town of Castle Rock and concerns a group of 4 adolescent boys who take a hike across the countryside to find the missing body of a dead kid in order to become local heroes. The adventure turns out to be life-changing experience for them as they learn more about themselves, the nature of friendships & the need to stand up for what's right.Rob Reiner's direction is admirable for the film is beautifully structured from start to finish & has a serene atmosphere that adds an incredible amount of warmth to the whole story. Screenplay keeps the innocence of its characters alive while managing to subtly deal with its underlying themes. Cinematography is beautifully carried out, editing provides the drama its required pace to connect with the viewers & the choice of music is tastefully done.Coming to the performances, Stand By Me features a young cast in Will Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman & Jerry O'Connell in their respective roles of Gordie, Chris, Teddy & Vern. And although everyone delivers fabulous performances, it's Wheaton & Phoenix who end up impressing the most and played their part extremely well.

A celebration of childhood, friendship, young passion & the time when we were always curious to discover new things, this nostalgic masterpiece is an ode to those years in everyone's life when friendships is at its most pure, innocent & selfless.

A celebration of childhood, friendship, young passion & the time when we were always curious to discover new things, this nostalgic masterpiece is an ode to those years in everyone's life when friendships is at its most pure, innocent & selfless. Delightfully recommended.

Animals have been focused on in Disney films since it was first founded in 1923, but never have such tiny creatures been the main focus on. Once every year, some grasshoppers come to an anthill and eat what the ants have made. One year, a bug named Flik (Dave Foley) by accident drops the seeds into the river. The grasshoppers give the ants one last chance to find the food by the next season. Flik goes off to find help, and meets up with a circus crew, giving the ants some hope... This plot can actually relate to the real world. We get many ants who all have to work together in order to protect their future, similar to how our society requires teamwork and problem solving in order to function. Children can find this message inspiring as well, but it's surprising how adults may find this plot suitable. The beautiful animation truly captures the difficult lifestyle that certain insects live in order to survive. It may even be considered an animated nature documentary about natural selection in the ant life by some. The animation is very beautiful and coordinated in a unique and visually striking way that is balanced with pure fun and some heartfelt animation with a clever script and great voice overs.
