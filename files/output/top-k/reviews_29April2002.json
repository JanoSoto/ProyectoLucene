However, I feel people need to watch more movies just like this, to understand that issues such as drugs are not going to go away without some sort of backlash against them. Drugs affect everyone, not just the users and the distributors, and Traffic proves this to be true. Traffic is a film that pushes beyond new boundaries.Interweaving three complex stories about the international drug trade, this story cuts to the very heart and soul of the fight against the drug epidemic. From the highest level of the US government, where a conservative politician who's just been appointed as the US drug czar learns that his daughter is a drug addict. The story then follows to the corruption on the streets of Mexico, where a crooked, yet dedicated cop struggles with his conscience when he learns that his new boss may not be the anti-drug official he made himself out to be.Praise for this movie has to go to Academy award winner Steven Soderberg, who did one fantastic job to bring this film to our screens. I enjoyed his work on `Erin Brockovich', but I think this film proves that he is a great talent. It must have been difficult to keep up with all the different locations this film had, yet Soderberg did it as only he can. He deserved the Academy award for Best Director of this movie, and rightly got it.The story of this film is so heavy, yet intriguing I am not sure where to start with it. I enjoyed the storyline that contained the US government official dealing with the drug problem, as it probably was the one character that I could feel compassion for the most. It would be difficult to have any child dealing with drugs, whether they distribute them or take them. Yet with this story we see how bad drugs can be for both the young teenager and for the parents, and what effect it has on the father the most. The situations that the audience gets to see the young teenage daughter put herself through and what she will do to get her next hit was also distressing and good to see on-screen. No ghosts were let lie in this part of the story. Then you have the two undercover cops, who are on the lookout for a drug ringleader and his wife. This part of the story involves a young wife and son, whose life could be endanger if the wrongs of their Husband\/Father are not righted. This shows how drugs not only affect individuals, but also people that you are connected to and love very much. The two cops are very good in this story as it is funny how they look after another criminal connected to the drug racket, and will help prove that the drug ringleader is guilty of the charges that have him facing a lengthy prison sentence.Finally the story also follows the drug problem in the streets of Mexico. People are heavily into drugs here, and could be blamed for the problem infiltrating its way into the United States. With the laws not being as stringent in Mexico, drug dealers can get away with giving drugs to anyone they feel like, whereas in America, the deals are done more cautiously.The cast of this film is of the highest quality. To have the now happily married couple of Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones on the same film was a good thing. The reason I say this is because at no stage do we see the pair together onscreen. If this was to happen I believe it would have ruined the feel of the film, it would have for me anyway. Erika Christensen brilliantly portrayed the role of the Caroline Wakefield. I believe she would have needed to go into some sort of drug counseling environment to get the feel for this role, and whatever she did, she made this role her own.The winner of the best supporting actor Benicio Del Toro, was a worthy winner with his role in this film. I felt he brought a very uneasy feel to this movie, which suited it perfectly. Yet there are so many other stars that make this a great cast. With Stars like Benjamin Bratt, James Brolin, Miguel Ferrier, Don Cheadle and &#145;Erin Brockovich's', Albert Finney.The story of this film is definitely a poignant one. Drug dealers might get money for what they do, and some romantic action in the bargain, but do they consider the consequences of who they are selling the drugs to? If young people are experimenting with drugs, then the chances of an overdose is very realistic, as young people are not mature enough to realise that what they are doing to themselves is bad enough to even kill them. This was evident in one of the opening scenes of the film, where one of the young drug users has overdosed and suffers a fit. The others around him panic and have no idea what to do.   So all in all this movie is something that needs to be followed up by topics that include alcohol, sex, smoking, criminal activities, drag racing, where the problem can be as big as that of drugs. This movie is what people have needed to see in a long time, as it proves no-one wins when it comes to a topic like that of drugs. If we can learn from movies, then I believe they have done one part of what they are meant to do, teach us about what life is really like. If it is easier to get drugs than alcohol, then the world needs to have a go hard look at itself. If that is the case we need to start to protect people from something that is very dangerous.

Well in this movie the bride to be has anything, but cold feet. She might as well be wearing running shoes down the alter, as that is what we get to see, not once but many times, and it is a funny thing to watch as well. Ike Graham is a big-city newspaper journalist who causes an uproar with an unflattering and wildly erroneous story about Maggie Carpenter, a small-town woman whose reputation for leaving men stranded at the alter has made her a local legend! But while Ike plans to prove he was right about Maggie all along&#133; and Maggie plans to even the score with Ike.. neither expect the sparks that fly when they finally meet! Now considering that Pretty Woman was one of Hollywood's biggest films of the eighties, and with good reason, it was always going to be difficult to cash in on its success for a second time. I believe that &#145;Runaway Bride' was trying to do such a thing. Although I personally enjoyed this film, I can see why some people might not have. It did not have the same appeal that audiences everywhere had for Pretty Woman. Perhaps the cast was in some way responsible for the movie being a popular choice for movie-goers to want to see. Undoubtedly, the onscreen presents of both Julia Roberts and Richard Gere is a big deal for movie fans. I can see why, this film for me backs up that relationship. Roberts is a star in her own right, who deserves all the accolades that come her way. You can not help but like her and that great smile. Gere has had a very good career also. With movies that include The Jackal, alongside Superstar Bruce Willis, Final Analysis and Primal Fear.I enjoyed the story that was presented to audiences in this film. Having a girl that continually runs out on her husband to be is an interesting concept, which was well adapted to the bigscreen.  Though I would hope in real life that a girl as gorgeous as Maggie Carpenter is, would not bolt for the church door when you are about to commit to her for your whole life. The story for this movie was written by two people, Josann Mcgibbon and Sara Parriott. I feel they both Director Garry Marshal also deserves a mention. You could feel (well I did at least) some part of Pretty Woman coming through in this film, and this undoubtedly was because of Garry. He has done some incredible work which include movies such as  The other sister, Beaches and TV shows the caliber of Mork and Mindy, Happy Days and Laverne and Shirley.This movie also had some good lines when it came to the issues of love, relationships and how men and women interact with each other. The one line that stands out the most would have to be when Maggie asks of Ike &#150;`Is there one &#145;right' person for everyone?'I love his response -`No, but I think attraction is mistaken for rightness.'I totally agree, because I think people can make so many mistakes when it comes to looking for that right person. That is the reason, I believe, for the high separation\/divorce rate. You need to be able to act like you always do around someone, in order to be able to say they are in someway &#145;right' for you, because if you cant then there is no point even trying to make a go with them.The music of &#145;Runaway Bride' was of significance to me, so much so that I did not realise how good that it was the first time. Martina McBride's tune of `I love you' was an obvious favourite from the film, with other artist including Coco- Lee, the Dixie Chicks, with a great rendition of the classic hit `You can't hurry love' , and U2. This is one soundtrack I definitely want to add to my collection.So the lesson this movie gives to its audience is that marriage might not be for every person.

I enjoyed the whole premise of the film. In addition having recently been getting medical help for some mental troubles, I would not have minded having Nathan Conrad as my Psychiatrist.`You want what they want, don't you&#133; I'll never tell&#133; any of you'. These are the haunting first words the near catatonic young patient utters to psychiatrist Nathan Conrad. Her Name is Elizabeth and she has been institutionalized for over a decade&#133; but now she has viciously battered a man to near death; and unless someone can break through to her, she will be locked away in an asylum forever. Conrad senses more than just meaningless ramblings coming from this disturbed young woman &#150; she is hiding something from deep in her past. And the sheer terror of it is about to consume her. But what this young girl knows will cut Conrad to the core and tear his family apart. His Daughter has just been kidnapped and it is linked to the secret Elizabeth holds. What is the connection? Who is behind it? How can he break through psychosis to reveal the truth?This is a terrific movie. All praise has to go the people behind the scenes that got the right feel for a great story. Director Gary Fleder, who was part of a film that I did not find much enjoyment from, that being &#145;Fight Club.' Well he has won me over with this brilliant piece of cinematography. I like the mood that he created for the audience, in addition to how dark that this film was. Yet I feel that it was not too over the top. I have seen darker films, where it has ruined the feel of the film completely.I also like how the story of this film was brought to the screen. Again it was another movie that was taken from a novel. These days we are getting many movies that are like this, but when they work, I can not see any problem with that. The novel this film was based on was &#145;Don't say a word' by a novelists Andrew Klavan. It was a terrific movie, so I can't see why the book would be any different.The cast of this film was first class. Michael Douglas is a screen favourite for many movie lovers and I am no exception. He was great as Doctor Nathan Conrad, a loving father and professional doctor. This has been one of his better roles in a long time. Douglas is one of the better actors I have been privileged to see. Brittany Murphy, who was the other important link in the whole movie, played the disturbed mental patient, Elizabeth. Her role was so good in this that you would have to expect some sort of training, but from all reports she had no help, but acted just the way that everyone from the film wanted. It must be a special talent to be able to do that. I enjoyed her role in the other mentally based drama, Girl Interrupted. Again her role in that film must have been no challenge as she is a natural at that sort of role. In fact her role was not too far away from eventual Academy award winner, Angelina Jolie.Other cast members include comedy man Oliver Platt, who was also good in a serious role as Dr Louis Sach. In addition to X-men star Famke Johnson, who starred as Conrad's Wife. Then you have the role of the Conrad's daughter, who was portrayed extremely well by young actress and singer, Skye McCole Bartusaik. This girl has a great opportunity to start a terrific movie career and I hope she can do so. The bad guy of this film was English actor, Sean Bean. The audience I feel are at no stage meant to like him, but you also want him to get his way or the Conrad's could lose so much. Bean was good in his role on the popular, but in my view, the disappointing &#145;Lord Of The Rings'.This film has an interesting side to it, by fact that it has many different stories rolled into one. Firstly you have the bad guys, who are in a spot of bother after years of trying to change the past. You have the family of the Conrad's, which is important for viewers to try and be close too. Then the relationship between Conrad and Elizabeth, which is of most importance to the whole story. I like films that use this style of story, because it keeps people interested in a movie and makes you watch even closer.In closing, Don't say a word is the sort of film I can sit back and love to watch. I am glad that I did not have to go to any sort of psychiatric care, while I was sick, because it looks like a daunting place. We need to be more aware of people who have mental problems, because they are people that can bring much to the world we live in, if given the medical help needed.

But these days, you can't keep your hopes too high when it comes to big Hollywood movies.  Despite its flaws, I was entertained and engrossed by the intriguing, though flawed, storyline.  The performances are great.  Morgan Freeman is enough reason to check this movie out.  Since he's a prestigious actor, he continually waits for a good script to come along, which is why he makes a movie about once or twice a year.  He takes the back seat and plays a supporting role this time around, but the limited time he has on screen is well spent.  In fact, he does something a little different  he plays the comic relief.  His character of an alcoholic, washed-up attorney with a prostitute girlfriend and a house that hasn't been cleaned in ages, leaves much room for humor.  Freeman has some great moments that made me laugh hysterically.  Ashley Judd gives another commanding performance.  Needless to say, she's great eye candy, being one of the most beautiful actresses in showbiz.  And Jim Caviezel, from Angel Eyes and Frequency, gives his best performance up-to-date.  I would get into detail about his performance, but I don't want to give away certain things about his character.  Just see it for yourself. The film does contain the usual array of plot holes and cliches.  In one scene, Ashley Judd is being slowly followed by a car behind her as she's taking a morning jog.  She tries to flee from the car, knocking on the door of an electronics store which is still closed.  As it turns out, the person following her is a woman asking for directions.  First of all that doesn't make sense and second of all we've seen that scenario before.  And speaking of scenarios we've seen before, like in all these types of movies there's always a scene where our main character is abducted by a strange individual who drives him\/her to a secret location and exposes all sorts of secrets essential to cracking the case.  Yep, expect to see one of those scenes as well.  You simply have to laugh at this film a little; as I said HAVE FUN.  And the surprise ending is pure Hollywood and I can honestly say I saw it coming from a mile (or two) away.  But it was delivered in a nifty fashion, and I can say that for most of the film.  Besides, it's kinda fun playing Count the Plot Holes.  It's kinda like when you used to watch those old Godzilla movies and look for the zipper in the back of his costume. The sexy Amanda Peet has a short, but scene-stealing role as Judd's chain-smoking sister.  High Crimes is high on fun, as long as you don't take it seriously.  Hell, I can tell Carl Franklin wasn't taking the movie seriously when he made it, adding a good supply of humor.  It doesn't break any new ground, but very few films do nowadays.

And the one who is arguably the leader of the pack, Leelee Sobieski, takes on the starring role here, in `My First Mister,' a story of two very different people, of different generations, both of whom are alone in the world (though in different ways and for different reasons), and who ultimately find what they need in one another-- and without even consciously looking for it.  Directed by Christine Lahti, It's a study, not only of human nature, but of the expansiveness and resiliency of the human spirit and of the heart, and how it is possible for two people to defy category and definition, and intuitively reach out to one another by allowing fate, or destiny-- or whatever you want to call it-- to take them beyond the parameters set by society, where-- as in this case-- they are able to find fulfillment in it's purest sense.  It's a revised chapter taken from the age-old book of The Human Comedy, updated to a contemporary setting to illustrate that now as much as ever, no man is an island; that everyone needs someone, that there is someone for everyone and, moreover, that one will instinctively seek out that kindred soul, often finding him in the most unlikely of places.\tJennifer (Sobieski) is an unhappy teen; she's adopted a goth look and lifestyle, embraces her autonomy, but in so doing has alienated just about everybody around her, including-- or perhaps especially-- her immediate family.  she simply cannot relate to her mother, Sylvie (Carol Kane), who seems perpetually mired in the &#145;50s (her appearance and attitude part of her own defense mechanisms and survival tactics), or her step-father, Bob (Michael McKean), a nondescript individual who is just...there.\tWhat Jennifer longs for is a place of her own, which she equates (albeit subconsciously) to independence, and toward that end she begins looking for the gainful employment that will enable her to achieve her immediate goal.  And it is during her job search that she encounters Randall (Albert Brooks), the manager of a men's clothing store.\tNecessity may be the proverbial mother of invention, but here it becomes the driving force that makes the connection between two people who-- if not for that necessity-- would never have known the other existed.  As it turns out, however, due to some quite personal circumstances and reasons of his own, Randall is something of a singular individual, and is able to see beyond Jennifer's outward appearance and attitude, and agrees to give her a job on a trial basis.  And it's the beginning of a unique relationship that will ultimately change both of their lives forever, and in ways that neither of them could possibly have imagined.\tThis is the first feature film that Lahti-- a fine actor herself-- has directed, and she does an exemplary job with it.  She knows her characters and the emotional terrain with which she is dealing, and subtly fills the story as it unfolds with pathos and poignancy, which she delivers with care and sensitivity.  Lahti has an eye for emotional detail and, perhaps due to her own extensive acting background, knows how to extract the precise sentiment she's endeavoring to express from her actors.  And because of the way it's presented, when the story takes an unexpected turn, the transition is so seamless it comes across as entirely real and convincing, which of course gives it credibility, and makes it believable.  Lahti has a gentle touch tempered with a restraint, and it gives her film a natural flow and a rhythm that draws in the viewer and makes for a satisfying and involving experience.\tComplementing Lahti's style, and assuring the success of this film, are the wonderful performances by Sobieski and Brooks.  Sobieski runs an emotional gamut in this film, and she does it with a poise and maturity beyond her years, making her journey from disenfranchised goth at the beginning of the film, to the individual she is at the end, plausible and convincing.  She manages to convey all of the emotional layers of her character, which enables the viewer to relate to the complexities of who this young woman is and what she's feeling, which-- since this is a character driven story-- is integral to the overall success of the film.  And Sobieski makes it so, with a memorable performance.\tA big part of the credit for the film's success has to go to Albert Brooks, as well.  As he does here with Randall, Brooks has an innate ability to create a character that is so normal, so average-guy-on-the-street, that it adds that total sense of reality to the film.  It's the little things that Brooks does so well, and that make all the difference; he gives the audience someone with whom they can truly empathize and identify, because he so succinctly manages to express all the affecting elements of everyday life-- the minutiae of day-to-day existence, as well as the corresponding emotions-- through his characters, and it's why you're going to remember Randall for a long, long time.  Like Ben Stiller, Brooks has a straightforward, often wry delivery that works so well, and which he uses to great effect.  And it certainly serves him well here.\tThe supporting cast includes Desmond Harrington (Randy), Mary Kay Place (Patty), Kevin Cooney (Doctor), William Forward (Customer) and Lisa Jane Persky (Sheila).  An entertaining, well crafted and delivered film that promises one thing and ends up giving much more, `My First Mister,' in the final analysis, is an engaging story that goes deep and touches the heart, and without any maudlin sentimentality attached.  Ultimately a transporting experience, this is one that will take you to a place you'll want to be, and you'll be glad you took the journey.  And that's the magic of the movies.

And the one who is arguably the leader of the pack, Leelee Sobieski, takes on the starring role here, in `My First Mister,' a story of two very different people, of different generations, both of whom are alone in the world (though in different ways and for different reasons), and who ultimately find what they need in one another-- and without even consciously looking for it.  Directed by Christine Lahti, It's a study, not only of human nature, but of the expansiveness and resiliency of the human spirit and of the heart, and how it is possible for two people to defy category and definition, and intuitively reach out to one another by allowing fate, or destiny-- or whatever you want to call it-- to take them beyond the parameters set by society, where-- as in this case-- they are able to find fulfillment in it's purest sense.  It's a revised chapter taken from the age-old book of The Human Comedy, updated to a contemporary setting to illustrate that now as much as ever, no man is an island; that everyone needs someone, that there is someone for everyone and, moreover, that one will instinctively seek out that kindred soul, often finding him in the most unlikely of places.\tJennifer (Sobieski) is an unhappy teen; she's adopted a goth look and lifestyle, embraces her autonomy, but in so doing has alienated just about everybody around her, including-- or perhaps especially-- her immediate family.  she simply cannot relate to her mother, Sylvie (Carol Kane), who seems perpetually mired in the &#145;50s (her appearance and attitude part of her own defense mechanisms and survival tactics), or her step-father, Bob (Michael McKean), a nondescript individual who is just...there.\tWhat Jennifer longs for is a place of her own, which she equates (albeit subconsciously) to independence, and toward that end she begins looking for the gainful employment that will enable her to achieve her immediate goal.  And it is during her job search that she encounters Randall (Albert Brooks), the manager of a men's clothing store.\tNecessity may be the proverbial mother of invention, but here it becomes the driving force that makes the connection between two people who-- if not for that necessity-- would never have known the other existed.  As it turns out, however, due to some quite personal circumstances and reasons of his own, Randall is something of a singular individual, and is able to see beyond Jennifer's outward appearance and attitude, and agrees to give her a job on a trial basis.  And it's the beginning of a unique relationship that will ultimately change both of their lives forever, and in ways that neither of them could possibly have imagined.\tThis is the first feature film that Lahti-- a fine actor herself-- has directed, and she does an exemplary job with it.  She knows her characters and the emotional terrain with which she is dealing, and subtly fills the story as it unfolds with pathos and poignancy, which she delivers with care and sensitivity.  Lahti has an eye for emotional detail and, perhaps due to her own extensive acting background, knows how to extract the precise sentiment she's endeavoring to express from her actors.  And because of the way it's presented, when the story takes an unexpected turn, the transition is so seamless it comes across as entirely real and convincing, which of course gives it credibility, and makes it believable.  Lahti has a gentle touch tempered with a restraint, and it gives her film a natural flow and a rhythm that draws in the viewer and makes for a satisfying and involving experience.\tComplementing Lahti's style, and assuring the success of this film, are the wonderful performances by Sobieski and Brooks.  Sobieski runs an emotional gamut in this film, and she does it with a poise and maturity beyond her years, making her journey from disenfranchised goth at the beginning of the film, to the individual she is at the end, plausible and convincing.  She manages to convey all of the emotional layers of her character, which enables the viewer to relate to the complexities of who this young woman is and what she's feeling, which-- since this is a character driven story-- is integral to the overall success of the film.  And Sobieski makes it so, with a memorable performance.\tA big part of the credit for the film's success has to go to Albert Brooks, as well.  As he does here with Randall, Brooks has an innate ability to create a character that is so normal, so average-guy-on-the-street, that it adds that total sense of reality to the film.  It's the little things that Brooks does so well, and that make all the difference; he gives the audience someone with whom they can truly empathize and identify, because he so succinctly manages to express all the affecting elements of everyday life-- the minutiae of day-to-day existence, as well as the corresponding emotions-- through his characters, and it's why you're going to remember Randall for a long, long time.  Like Ben Stiller, Brooks has a straightforward, often wry delivery that works so well, and which he uses to great effect.  And it certainly serves him well here.\tThe supporting cast includes Desmond Harrington (Randy), Mary Kay Place (Patty), Kevin Cooney (Doctor), William Forward (Customer) and Lisa Jane Persky (Sheila).  An entertaining, well crafted and delivered film that promises one thing and ends up giving much more, `My First Mister,' in the final analysis, is an engaging story that goes deep and touches the heart, and without any maudlin sentimentality attached.  Ultimately a transporting experience, this is one that will take you to a place you'll want to be, and you'll be glad you took the journey.  And that's the magic of the movies.

Phil Noyce has produced here a piece of cinematic poetry when it could have easily been tendentious agit-prop. The story from the 1930s of three half-cast aboriginal girls walking 2000 km of Western Australia to escape the clutches of white assimilationists is seen through their frame of reference. We see the harsh beauty of the countryside as they do, not an alien landscape but as their back yard. They have all been brought up in the desert and together know how to survive, a point eventually realised by their pursuers, who then lie in wait at their destination.The three young girls, Mollie, Grace and Daisy, are stunningly portrayed by Everlyn Sampi, Tianna Sainsbury and Laura Monaghan. Molly, at 14 the oldest, has the largest part but the three of them function together as if they really were sisters. Their mother and grandmother , played by Ningali Lawson and Myana Lawson (daughter and mother in real life) are equally convincing, as is David Gulpilil as the relentless black tracker.The most difficult role in the film is that of A O Neville (Mr Devil, as the aborigines called him), Chief Protector of Aborigines, a sincere and energetic advocate of the monstrous policy which resulted in a generation or more of half-cast children being removed from their families. It would be easy to pillory Neville as a monster, but Kenneth Branagh manages to give us a rounded picture of a man who was not inhumane, who tried to advance what he saw as the welfare of his charges despite lack of money and enormous logistical problems (not to mention an unco-operative police force). Had it not been for these obstacles the aboriginality of Australia would probably have been reduced to a few scattered reserves in the deserts run as freak shows for tourists.Some critics of the armchair lefty variety have criticised the movie as not being political enough, and its true there's plenty of room for righteous (or leftist) indignation on the topic of the stolen generation, but I think a more overt political message would have diminished it. Imagine say, if John Pilger had made this film. Instead we have a near-classic. Never I have I seen the visual power of the Australian landscape better depicted, and seldom have I seen a better celebration of the human spirit. And this is a true story. The real Molly and Daisy take their bows at the end. Things didn't quite work out for them the way they might have, but they survived and stayed with their people.

At that point, it's back to every man for himself.

His fingerprints would have been on the plastic and yet no one in the film picked up on this. I know most films nowadays stretch creditability but this was ridiculous. No one in the police department thought to fingerprint the plastic that the body was wrapped in! I guess you could be forgiven for the slip up by the lads but there again, one of them was a supposed expert when it came to forensics. Did he not notice that his accomplice was not wearing gloves? Tacky. The only thing I found really disturbing about this movie was the relationship between the two boys and how one seemed to control the other. As we all know, unfortunately, life does imitate art imitating life and this type of scenario happening in real life is very believable and frightening.

It's supposed to be. It has an almost old-school style that involves an odyssey for the main character through the streets of New York. There are almost two threads to this movie, one of the adventures during a 24 hour period through Bill's mind and also his connection to his wife Alice. They won't come together until the end. The result is a film that has almost two climaxes, one in the middle and one near the end. Both are great scenes, especially the one in the middle, it has to be one of the greatest pieces of cinema ever put on film. You might not see the climax at the end coming, or wonder how it could be even possible, but it's incredibly appropriate. You also get a film that has meticulously crafted interiors that you see both in the night and the morning after. The problem of having a thematic climax in the middle is that the morning after scenario can get a little boring, but that contrasts the great rising action in the first half. But by the second half you have even more to think about.The film is a great way of expressing the philosophy through colors; there are references to rainbows and colors that go out of their way to be symbolic. This is definitely one of the best dream worlds ever pictured. While some of the dialogue is a little far-fetched (like the philosophical argument husband and wife get into) much of it is very realistic communication. You really get the idea that the characters don't know what they are going to say next. The film has a wit all of its own. Eyes Wide Shut is an experimental film that uses an old framework (an odyssey, chronicles of secondary characters that are met on the way, and even chorus elements) that you won't see very much of today in movies and it succeeds. Eyes Wide Shut is a film where the chorus (the secret society) is able to communicate with and control the main character. If you want philosophy you can keep coming back to, this film is for you. If you want entertainment and happen to be a patient person, I guarantee this will hold your attention. It's especially absorbing the first time through. Don't expect a sexual romp, though. People are just starting to think this one out, one day it will probably be regarded as 2001 is today, though it may never have the same mainstream appeal because of its content matter.

Sofia Coppola appears to want to explain that the restrictions of parents with high expectations can break your heart and also end your life.  The movie is not bursting with the energy and feeling that you want to reach out and hug it as Ghost World proved but there is a sense of foretelling the fates of the four beautiful girls by allowing them to witness teenage rites of passage and experience excitement in the short moments before their untimely deaths.The Virgin Suicides is restrictive in that the focus is always on what is revealed at the end with the demise of four siblings and not on the fundamental qualities of the lovely sister's lives.  Certainly their lives are rooted in being cooped up in the home they share with Kathleen Turner and James Woods and they exist solely as empty creatures who are already dead in spirit but not yet in being.  Lux Lisbon is the only sister who seems to believe that there is a way out of the misery and appears to have an outgoing personality that will prevent her from allowing her spirit to die.  Inexplicably we find that she is little more than a facade who is not comfortable with the person she appears to be and her life ends tragically like all the rest.

But when he's sentenced to a community service assignment, he must coach a ragtag team of peewee hockey players who can't skate, can't score and can't win. First he teaches the hapless team everything about winning and they teach him that winning is not everything. Watch the pucks fly as they battle their way to the most important game of their lives!This film is a great story for young up and coming sports &#145;people' to watch and learn that winning is not the be all and end all of sport. Sure there are some people such as Coach Reilly, because they are not true sports lovers. Instead they treat sport as a serious event, not something that as Gordon Bombay says should be &#145;fun'. In Australia, and my part of this country, we have Aussie Rules football, which again is a very team orientated sport. Although it can have some extraordinary individuals that play, the theme is still the same, that a team has to stick together and try as hard as it can.This movie has a very young and funny cast, with some old heads thrown in for good team balance. The obvious star is Emilio Estevez, who stars as Gordon Bombay. While he is a very aggressive character in the beginning, Gordon brings his knowledge and experience to a group of young kids that would make any sports coach proud. Estevez has had a good movie career, with some of his more well known movies being The Breakfast Club, St. Elmo's Fire, and an unaccredited role in Mission Impossible . The other main star is a very young Joshua Jackson who portrayed Charlie Conway, a good ice-hockey player, who reminds his coach a lot of himself as a young peewee hockey player. Jackson has made a name for himself in Hollywood starring in films such as Cruel Intentions, the disappointing Skulls and the popular TV drama, `Dawson's Creek'.Other cast members also include the rival coach of the Hawks Ice-Hockey team, Coach Reilly  played by veteran actor Lane Smith.  He also starred in another great film I saw recently, which happened to be on another popular sport, that of  golf, the film being `The Legend of Bagger Vance'. All the characters that are on the Mighty ducks team are likeable people. The team consists of a fat kid, a silent kid, a nice kid, a wiseacre kid, a figure-skating princess, and a tough kid. The whole formula works for me anyway. I thought that this film had some impressive Ice-Hockey scenes that looked real, though I will never know if they are real or not. Ice-Hockey is a demanding sport and this movie shows that this is the case, with heavy bumps and unrelenting pressure on players. It was good to see that this sport has both males and females playing together, again the movie shows how well the two can gel. So, if you think that sport is not your thing, but want to give it a go, perhaps this film is what you need to watch. Although this isn't the most talented group of athletes to take the ice, and in the beginning the Ducks do really &#145;suck', they prove that with some good coaching guidance and team camaraderie, anything is possible if you put your mind to it.QUACK QUACK QUACK &#150; Go the Ducks!Rating 8\/10 or 4 Stars ","genre":null},{"date":"29 April 2002","score":"17 out of 24 people found the following review useful","review":"  The Mighty Ducks (aka as the Champions), is one of the great Disney movies I have seen.

The formula for the success of the longest running, the British Coronation Street and Eastenders for instance, is self-identification, the depiction in a heightened dramatic form of the sort of problems we all live with, bringing a degree of comfort and assurance to the audience watching a fictionalisation of its collective angst.  When we liken a finite form such as a film to soap we tend to use the term in a derogatory sense isofar as we see it as dramatising trivia.  However we must be careful about this as there have been examples of very high cinematic art that conform to the conventions of soap opera, The Best Years of our Lives for instance in the '40s, the German Heimat a few years back and more recently Edward Yang's A One and a two.  It is that very element of everyday anxiety viewed with such perception and truth that makes the Taiwanese film so compelling.  Yang has moved away from the youth violence of A Brighter Summer Day.  His middle class family is involved with commerce and careers.  However noone has an easy time of it.  Each member of the family is plagued in their different ways by their inadequacy in coping with the infirmity of their eldest member.  At the same time the father is troubled by his work and the complication of the reappearance in his life of a woman he met many years ago, his wife is seeking spiritual advice from a Buddhist guru, his teenage daughter becomes the butt of romantic jealousy from the girl next door.  But it is the 8 year old son who seems most able to come to terms with the vicissitudes of life.  He survives the spiteful taunts of his little girl peers and a bullying schoolmaster.  His defence is an enquiring mind which he applies to his surroundings with a Kaspar Hauser fortitude and innocence.  We already know that if any of these characters will be a survivor it is this youngest.  Yang shoots the film with an almost Ozu-like purity, preferring long held shots rather than camera movements, although unlike Ozu he does not make a fetish of this.  Often we see action through windows but not  at a distance as in Rear Window so everything has an immediacy.  It will need a few more viewings to assess whether A One and a Two is on the same level as Yang's earlier A Brighter Summer Day.  At the moment something tells me that is does not quite measure up to that savage masterpiece.  Its very gentleness could be the reason, although I recognise this is hardly a valid argument.  After three viewings it remains for me a rather elusive work, compelling in its way but curiously difficult to evaluate.

However we must be careful about this as there have been examples of very high cinematic art that conform to the conventions of soap opera, The Best Years of our Lives for instance in the '40s, the German Heimat a few years back and more recently Edward Yang's A One and a two.  It is that very element of everyday anxiety viewed with such perception and truth that makes the Taiwanese film so compelling.  Yang has moved away from the youth violence of A Brighter Summer Day.  His middle class family is involved with commerce and careers.  However noone has an easy time of it.  Each member of the family is plagued in their different ways by their inadequacy in coping with the infirmity of their eldest member.  At the same time the father is troubled by his work and the complication of the reappearance in his life of a woman he met many years ago, his wife is seeking spiritual advice from a Buddhist guru, his teenage daughter becomes the butt of romantic jealousy from the girl next door.  But it is the 8 year old son who seems most able to come to terms with the vicissitudes of life.  He survives the spiteful taunts of his little girl peers and a bullying schoolmaster.  His defence is an enquiring mind which he applies to his surroundings with a Kaspar Hauser fortitude and innocence.  We already know that if any of these characters will be a survivor it is this youngest.  Yang shoots the film with an almost Ozu-like purity, preferring long held shots rather than camera movements, although unlike Ozu he does not make a fetish of this.  Often we see action through windows but not  at a distance as in Rear Window so everything has an immediacy.  It will need a few more viewings to assess whether A One and a Two is on the same level as Yang's earlier A Brighter Summer Day.  At the moment something tells me that is does not quite measure up to that savage masterpiece.  Its very gentleness could be the reason, although I recognise this is hardly a valid argument.  After three viewings it remains for me a rather elusive work, compelling in its way but curiously difficult to evaluate.

The Rookie is a Disney production, yet it doesn't have that Disney feel.  And it doesn't feel G-rated either.  In fact, this movie does a fine job at avoiding overused cliches in the genre of sports dramas and stands on its own two feet.  The premise of a high school science teacher suddenly becoming a major league ballplayer seems a little far-fetched, but it's a true story!  So I can't complain it was unconvincing.  The performances are terrific.  Dennis Quaid is good in virtually every movie he does, and he again delivers a subtle, convincing performance.  Brian Cox is great as his workaholic father, who tries to convince him that there's more to life than baseball.  Rachel Griffiths is perfectly cast as Quaid's wife, who also tries to discourage him from baseball.  Though Griffiths is Australian, I don't think any American actress could've played her role better, and she perfectly dons a Texas accent.  I have few bad things to say about The Rookie other than it was long and dull.  I didn't enjoy the overuse of country music on the soundtrack, though I know that it was used simply to give the movie a Texas feel.  You can't expect the soundtrack to include Metallica!  And though the movie does a pretty good job at avoiding cliches, there are still a few that exist.  Like what I was talking about earlier, about Quaid's wife and father discouraging him from baseball.  There's one scene where his Dad gives him a speech\/monologue--standing inside the house, many feet away from his son--about how there's more to life than baseball.  Done with his speech, he closes the door and goes back into the house.  No Goodbye son or anything like that.  Then he comes home and his wife gives him the same speech, only she goes outside to the porch to apologize to him minutes later and they give each other the you were right, I was wrong run-around.  Another problem is the film takes too much time stressing the fact that Jimmy Morris is a brilliant pitcher.  I think if the director cut out most of his pitching scenes, the movie would be about 85 minutes.  Now, I love that scene in which he pulls off to the side of the road to practice pitching by throwing the ball towards a meter, which measures the speeds of passing cars.  The meter reads 76 MPH.  Then when he goes to pick up the ball, we watch as it changes to 96 MPH.  Once we watch that scene, we already know that he's a brilliant pitcher, we don't need it pounded into our skulls.  I don't even know how good of a batter he is, because they never show him at bat!  There's a good deal of things I give this movie credit for, but all in all it just doesn't deliver.  Sure, it doesn't have the formula cliches of last year's Hardball, but it also doesn't have the charm and fun of Hardball.  I wasn't uplifted, nor entertained, so this movie pretty much left me cold.
