Upon arrival, they learn that a strange aircraft has been discovered built of alien materials to which they gain access and discover a giant frozen alien lifeform. They bring it back to their base, where a careless soldier allows it to thaw, and the crew find themselves under siege from the giant monster that doesn't seem to be able to be killed. Soon, Carrington and Hendry find themselves at loggerheads, as Carrington wishes to preserve the beast for scientific research, and Scott sees it as a threat to humanity and will stop at nothing to destroy it.I was surprised at how different this throwback sci-fi is to its much more popular and admittedly vastly superior remake The Thing (1982). John Carpenter's re-imagining is more sophisticated and memorable, but Christian Nyby's original, based on John W. Campbell's novel Who Goes There?, has a lot going for it and is one of the more exciting and politically-charged of the 1950's sci-fi's. Nyby directed under the watchful eyes of Howard Hawks, so naturally, this is a very American tale, and very much a product of its era. In an America wary of Communist infiltration, Cornthwaite's Dr. Carrington is portrayed as a maniacal madman, who is willing to sacrifice the lives of his colleagues for scientific data, whereas Tobey's Hendry is the square-jawed American hero, who sees the need to stamp out the threat before it can bare its influence across America. Obviously this is a bunch of nonsense from an ignorant time, but it cements the film as being historically and politically significant, as well as being extremely good fun.Little is seen of the 'Thing' itself (played by western legend James Arness - who passed away last year), which allows the film to build far more tension than the many rubber-suited creature-features that were churned out in the 1950's. It is usually hidden away with shadows so the film never feels silly, and really makes an impact in one impressive scene which sees Scott set it ablaze. It is a fully-body burn, something which is extremely dangerous even by today's standards. An un-involving romantic sub-plot between Hendry and Carrington's secretary Nikkie Nicholson (Margaret Sheridan) aside, the film breezes by and is very good fun, and if you can see past all the political nonsense, then this is one of the best of the B-movie sci-fi\/horrors to come out of the era.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com ","genre":null},{"date":"19 May 2012","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Upon receiving a request for re-enforcements from brilliant scientist Dr. Carrington (Robert Cornthwaite), General Fogerty (David McMahon) dispatches a U.S. Air Force team led by Captain Hendry (Kenneth Tobey) to a remote area of Alaska.

(Incidentally, she's great in Below, which I highly recommend as a WWII sub movie - but it's best watched without any reviews, and even without looking at the box - it's best viewed totally fresh, with zero foreknowledge.

His first few lines, I was... are rather haunting, when you sit down to think about it; they convey a lot of the atmosphere of the film, and go far towards reminding you the world of the Postman is very different.Daniel von Bargen is excellent, and provides a very good foil for Costner to play off towards the beginning of the film.

Some of the costuming stands out positively (especially the improvised uniformity of the Holnists and the carriers), while the costuming for pretty much everybody else is slightly overdone - you can tell there was work put into it, but sometimes almost too much.Overall, the theme is one that may be lost on many folks, and was especially lost at the time.

The book depicts in savage detail numerous and grotesque acts of violence towards women, mixed with a pornographic level of sexual content, that led to a great deal of controversy and outrage on its release.Set among the wealthy elite of Manhattan at the tail end of the 1980's, 'American Psycho' spans about three years in the life of privileged investment banker 'Patrick Bateman'. The book documents his everyday activities, told from his detached, self-obsessed perspective. There are frequent accounts of sex acts with prostitutes that 'Bateman solicits'; these (hardbodies) as he puts it are subjected to the worst descriptions of torture, rape, mutilation, cannibalism, and necrophilia. Originally optioned in 1991 just after its release, hoping to cash in on the wave of controversy generated by the book, the idea of an 'American Psycho' movie was shopped around the major studios. A number of scripts were drawn up, some scripted by Ellis himself, but treated the movie as a joke, Ellis even ended his script with 'Bateman' breaking into song, joined by the whole of New York.Instead the studio settled on Mary Harron, who had achieved a level of success with her 1996 film 'I shot Andy Warhol' (a period piece set in the sixties), Harron was given the task of creating 1980s Wall Street; at the peak of its 'greed is good' mentality. Initially, she considered a number of actors for the role of Bateman, including Billy Crudup, Ben Chaplin, Jonny Lee Miller, and Jared Leto. Eventually, Harron offered the part to Christian Bale, a little known, at the time British actor.Having accepted the role, Bale was met with contempt from producers, who tried to talk Harron into casting Edward Norton instead. Refusing, Harron stuck to her decision, insisting she would only make the movie if Bale was her lead. The studio finally relented, but as compensation they insisted the supporting cast be rounded out with big name actors. Agreeing, Harron hired William Defoe to play Kimball and Reese Witherspoon to play Evelyn.With knives pointed squarely at the 'yuppie' juggler, Harron and her writing partner Guinevere Turner, set about to turn Ellis's episodic un- filmable novel into a viable movie. That scathingly dissects the wretched yuppie consumer driven lifestyle, under the movies sharp script. Along with a hypnotically unhinged performance by Bale, the movie turns what could have been a sadistic run of the mill serial killer movie, into something darkly comic and unique.What little plot exists in the movie is loosely strung together by the murder of Paul Allen and the investigation into his disappearance. 'American Psycho' deliberately feels incoherent and detached as people fail to recognise each other, and often mistake one person for another, as they have becomes so interchangeable. Just as 'Bateman'spends all day in his office but never works, and visits 'ATMS' to with draw cash to an already over filled wallet. These people and their lives may look glamorous and filled with purpose, but scratch the surface and you'l find there's nothing there.Speaking recently in an interview, Harron spoke of how she saw 'Bateman' as an alien life form, trying to copy our mannerisms, to fit in, as he puts it. He acts as human as he can, but he's so twisted by greed and status that he's stopped being one of us, more of an entity, collected from the cesspool of all that was rotten in the greed is good era.Bale inhabits 'Bateman', in a way no other actor possibly could. His skin an orange glow, his body a rippling series of muscles, covered by exquisitely designed suits. He so inhabits the character, that when you see him on screen you just see 'Bateman', never a performance. Having watched an appearance by Tom Cruise on the David Letterman show, Bale modeled his character on what he calls this very intense friendliness with nothing behind the eyes masked by an appropriately phony smile.During the shooting of the film, Bale never dropped character even speaking in an American accent off set at all times. It was only at the wrap party, that he finally spoke in his own British accent, to the surprise of the crew members who thought he was speaking that way as a joke. It's that level of commitment that makes Bale the perfect casting choice, told at the time it would be career suicide to play the consumer monster; it instead had the opposite effect, leading to another American psycho, 'The Batman'.Filled with endlessly quotable dialogue and classic scenes, like Bateman's moonwalk in the infamous 'hey Paul' scene. The movie has taken on another life since being released, even surpassing the notorious book that it was based on.

Eventually, Harron offered the part to Christian Bale, a little known, at the time British actor.Having accepted the role, Bale was met with contempt from producers, who tried to talk Harron into casting Edward Norton instead. Refusing, Harron stuck to her decision, insisting she would only make the movie if Bale was her lead. The studio finally relented, but as compensation they insisted the supporting cast be rounded out with big name actors. Agreeing, Harron hired William Defoe to play Kimball and Reese Witherspoon to play Evelyn.With knives pointed squarely at the 'yuppie' juggler, Harron and her writing partner Guinevere Turner, set about to turn Ellis's episodic un- filmable novel into a viable movie. That scathingly dissects the wretched yuppie consumer driven lifestyle, under the movies sharp script. Along with a hypnotically unhinged performance by Bale, the movie turns what could have been a sadistic run of the mill serial killer movie, into something darkly comic and unique.What little plot exists in the movie is loosely strung together by the murder of Paul Allen and the investigation into his disappearance. 'American Psycho' deliberately feels incoherent and detached as people fail to recognise each other, and often mistake one person for another, as they have becomes so interchangeable. Just as 'Bateman'spends all day in his office but never works, and visits 'ATMS' to with draw cash to an already over filled wallet. These people and their lives may look glamorous and filled with purpose, but scratch the surface and you'l find there's nothing there.Speaking recently in an interview, Harron spoke of how she saw 'Bateman' as an alien life form, trying to copy our mannerisms, to fit in, as he puts it. He acts as human as he can, but he's so twisted by greed and status that he's stopped being one of us, more of an entity, collected from the cesspool of all that was rotten in the greed is good era.Bale inhabits 'Bateman', in a way no other actor possibly could. His skin an orange glow, his body a rippling series of muscles, covered by exquisitely designed suits. He so inhabits the character, that when you see him on screen you just see 'Bateman', never a performance. Having watched an appearance by Tom Cruise on the David Letterman show, Bale modeled his character on what he calls this very intense friendliness with nothing behind the eyes masked by an appropriately phony smile.During the shooting of the film, Bale never dropped character even speaking in an American accent off set at all times. It was only at the wrap party, that he finally spoke in his own British accent, to the surprise of the crew members who thought he was speaking that way as a joke. It's that level of commitment that makes Bale the perfect casting choice, told at the time it would be career suicide to play the consumer monster; it instead had the opposite effect, leading to another American psycho, 'The Batman'.Filled with endlessly quotable dialogue and classic scenes, like Bateman's moonwalk in the infamous 'hey Paul' scene. The movie has taken on another life since being released, even surpassing the notorious book that it was based on.

The book depicts in savage detail numerous and grotesque acts of violence towards women, mixed with a pornographic level of sexual content, that led to a great deal of controversy and outrage on its release.Set among the wealthy elite of Manhattan at the tail end of the 1980's, 'American Psycho' spans about three years in the life of privileged investment banker 'Patrick Bateman'. The book documents his everyday activities, told from his detached, self-obsessed perspective. There are frequent accounts of sex acts with prostitutes that 'Bateman solicits'; these (hardbodies) as he puts it are subjected to the worst descriptions of torture, rape, mutilation, cannibalism, and necrophilia. Originally optioned in 1991 just after its release, hoping to cash in on the wave of controversy generated by the book, the idea of an 'American Psycho' movie was shopped around the major studios. A number of scripts were drawn up, some scripted by Ellis himself, but treated the movie as a joke, Ellis even ended his script with 'Bateman' breaking into song, joined by the whole of New York.Instead the studio settled on Mary Harron, who had achieved a level of success with her 1996 film 'I shot Andy Warhol' (a period piece set in the sixties), Harron was given the task of creating 1980s Wall Street; at the peak of its 'greed is good' mentality.

After the Lewis boys hit Terry's car he is determined to get his revenge. The boys meanwhile have got it in for Bryn after he refuses to pay any compensation when their father is hurt on one of his business sites. They start off their cycle of revenge by urinating on Bryn's daughter as she sings at the local karaoke night... things quickly escalate to killing pets and ultimately the boys' parents and sister are killed when Terry is trying to set fire to their dog... from then on things get darker as the boys set about getting their revenge and Terry tries to find somebody else to blame.As stated before this is not 'Trainspotting' so if you expect something like that you will be disappointed, it is however very funny for the most part although you are likely to suffer mood whiplash half way through when people start dying. Real life brothers Llyr and Rhys Ifans do well as the Lewis brothers, bringing a real sense of anarchy to the roles, Dougray Scott is the other most notable actor; bringing a sense of menace to the part of Terry while still being funny. While it is for the most part fairly funny there are few genuinely likable characters; even the ones we are meant to like are criminals!

'Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan' was a vast improvement over it's ambitious, but seriously flawed predecessor. It was going to be a tough act to follow, especially considering how it ends. Fortunately, the cards looked good and the result was another strong entry in the long-running series.Pros Great performances. Strong direction by Mr. Nimoy. Beautifully scored. Well written. Plot full of twists and turns. Most of the effects are good. Fast paced all the way. Some good touches of humor. Nice production design, especially on the planet.Cons Some dated visuals. Christopher Lloyd does fine, but isn't very menacing here. The killing off of a certain character was too soon.Final thoughts Many feel that the odd numbered 'Trek' films are the weakest. III may not be the cream of the crop, but it's no dud either. It delivers the kind of Sci-Fi entertainment one hopes for. So many sequels are made solely for the money. This film on the other hand was a labor of love and it shows.My rating 4\/5 ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"19 May 2012","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" The Serpent and the Rainbow is true horror, a deeply sinister tale just dripping with flavour and atmosphere. It's based on the non-fiction book by Wade Davis, and tells the story of anthropologist Dennis Alan (Bill Pullman) who travels to Haiti for the purpose of investigating what could be causing supposedly dead people to still be alive. He finds himself in a whole lot of trouble, what with his stubborn insistence on solving the mystery and poking his nose into places where other people don't want it. His chief antagonist is local policeman Dargent Peytraud (an effectively scary Zakes Mokae), a man who's not exactly subtle about his malevolent intentions. Fortunately, Dennis has some allies, in the form of crusading doctor Marielle DuChamp (gorgeous Cathy Tyson) and business owner Lucien Celine (Paul Winfield). There are some absolutely great horror moments in this very competently made chiller, and some very vivid characters. Dennis, unfortunately, is an intelligent but not terribly likable protagonist, and Pullman can't do much to make us want to root for him; it's the other actors & characters that really make this sing. Tyson is appealing and Winfield solid as always; Brent Jennings as Mozart, Conrad Roberts as Christophe, Michael Gough as Schoonbacher, Badja Djola as Gaston, Theresa Merritt as Simone, and Paul Guilfoyle as Andrew Cassedy are all fine, especially the engaging Jennings and the haunted Roberts who is able to mine his part for much pathos. Adding to the feel of the piece is its political subtext as the movie takes place during the reign of the notorious Baby Doc Duvalier. Makeup and visual effects are nicely done, and the movie has some good zombie action and highly surreal moments. It sizes up as one of the more interesting and entertaining films of Craven's career, projecting a strong sense of doom & gloom; it could have used some more humour, and the finale gets a bit silly, but overall, it's definitely worth a look.

Elliott Gould is about the last person I'd think of casting as Marlowe, and his take on the character quickly made me forget about the original source material and had me viewing the story as a Seventies murder mystery. On that level the picture works well enough for me. I enjoy the sarcasm coming from a straight character like Marlowe, though the writing was somewhat lacking in the snappy banter department. The contrast to Bogey getting grilled by Ward Bond and Barton MacLane in The Maltese Falcon is what I'm referring to, the dialog here didn't quite pull it off. I know, Bogey was Sam Spade in that one, but you get the idea.Cinematically the picture's a treat, and I don't think I've ever been as enthralled with a filming technique as much as the one used here when Roger Wade (Sterling Hayden) and his wife (Nina van Pallandt) have the conversation in his study as Marlowe hangs out on the beach behind them. The double exposure technique, or whatever it's called, constantly shifts your attention between the parties and adds to the surreal nature of the crimes being investigated.You know, when gangster Marty Augustine (Mark Rydell) had his henchmen strip down in that confrontation with Marlowe, I didn't know what to make of that guy with the bulging muscles who looked like Arnold Schwarzenneger. Turns out it was him after all when I checked the uncredited cast list, imagine that. I'd also like to find out how Jim Bouton was selected to play the part of Marlowe's pal Lennox. Not being that much of a baseball fan, I didn't recognize him playing the character, but learning about it after the fact made me do a double take.The kicker in all this of course is the fatal ending for the already presumed dead Terry Lennox. I don't know that Chandler's hero ever took it personally, but here was Marlowe collecting payback big time. Just goes to show that you can only take friendship so far.
