Without giving away too much, Shrek is a clever twist on the fairy-tales and kid's movies that we all know, wrapped with comedy that's really funny simply because you just wouldn't expect it from a kid's film.

A bit shocking but there,i still love this film i can't put my finger on. maybe because its funny,oddly charming,exciteing and inventive that's why. I know the film is far from sophisticated and has some very bad lines of dialogue in the script,but it's obviously because it's a tribute to the b. movies of the 1950's. This was never intended to be a serious film. I mean come on its about a giant beer swilling,cigar chomping,sarcastic duck for christ sake. What the critic's expected this film to be like i will never know. Its not as if it was intended to win oscars,in less they expected the next E.T. I still think this is better than most kid's films(yes it is a kids film you know) of today and dare i say it,but i'd rather watch this than sit thought toy story any day of the week. Even if you don't have kids,if you still haven't seen this undervalued gem see it know and make up your own mind.You may enjoy it It's not that bad.p.s i am mentality stable.

If you have read the book you'll probably want to see the film just out of curiousity, you may still want to see it because of what you've read or heard from friends.

Scorsese draws brilliant performances out of each and every one of his actors, scoring an Oscar nomination for Loraine Bracco (The Sopranos) and a win for Joe Pesci.  Pesci shows us a glimpse into true evil as Tommy DeVito, a man so caught up in power and greed that he's lost any semblance of humanity.  Liota's performance hits the mark as well.  Each time a murder is committed in his presence, he has a brief moment with the camera in which he agonizes over the realization that it is just another part of the job. His understated performance somehow allows the viewer to actually sympathize with his situation.  `Goodfellas' is about a family.  Liotta's kids know their Don as `Uncle Pauly' and literally jump up and down with enthusiasm at the prospect of going to his place for dinner.  They cook together, laugh together, and dig graves together.  Don't miss it!
