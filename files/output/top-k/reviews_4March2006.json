The film starts off in 1976 in Manchester, England where Tony is a local television news reporter. After seeing a performance by the group The Sex Pistols on stage Tony tries to get his station to televise one of their performances. Soon many punk groups are coming after Tony and so he and some of his friends create a record label called Factory Records and a club called The Hacienda Club. With the help of Tony and his record label he helped launch such bands as The Happy Mondays, Joy Division and New Order. This film tells the story in a false documentary like fashion. 24 Hour Party People has good direction, a good original script, a great performance by Steve Coogan as Tony Wilson, good cinematography and good film editing. The film has a very intelligent script that is often filled with good dialog and some very unique and clever moments. It also has a neat visual look to it with it's cinematography and visual effects that I thought really looked good and really set the mood for the type of film that this is. I thought Steve Coogan did a very good job playing Tony Wilson and Coogan plays him as a smart but yet sometimes frustrated individual and he also brought a lot of humour and wit to the role as well. Other than being a good looking film and having a good leading performance 24 Hour Party People is also a fascinating film and I liked the way the director and screenwriter told the story as a mockumentary and included some off the wall scenes in for fun. This film is interesting, neat to look at and a lot of fun. I also think that anyone who is a fan of the 80's club and music scene will also appreciate this movie and it's unique style and way of telling it.

Evidently the writer of Pie 1 (Adam Herz) wasn't overly excited about doing another but it's fortunate that he did, because he surpassed what was done in Pie 1 on many levels. Herz and the supporting story editors gave the characters and giving their lives more dimension. We see them all again here one year later (although produced two years after Pie 1), having all gone through the pivotal first year of college. In some ways, we're seeing a re-vamp of the events of Pie 1...but now we go a few steps further. For instance, the character of Michelle Flaherty was seen ever so briefly in Pie 1 and Pie 2 and now we get to know her almost completely. Steve Stifler is his usual obnoxious self, and he's become even more-so in a year's time. Then of course, there's the principal character, Jim Levenstein - no longer a virgin but still quite innocent - and by the end of the movie, he's pretty much come full circle. The acting is pretty superb all around, and the director got the best out of the actors. Jason Biggs is not a big talent, but he has many small-but-bright moments throughout, and his adeptness at physical comedy is given a good display here. Seann William Scott's comedic range over the two flicks is huge, and it's hard to imagine anyone else playing the part of Stifler. The supporting actors (who all returned from Pie 1) are at their best as well, with splendid newcomers George Wyner playing the Senior Counselor at band camp, and Denise Faye & Lisa Arturo playing the house owners. The subplots in Pie 2 (Band Camp, the guys' summer job of painting houses owned by beautiful women, and so forth) bring hilarious results. Adam Herz has a unique ear for dialog and characterization - I hope we see more of his work in the future. Personally, I think Pie 2 would've been a good place to stop. Pie 3 was a bomb and Pie 4 bears only a tiny resemblance to Pies 1, 2, and 3. The greatest aspect of Pie 1 and 2, but especially 2, is that they appeal to a surprisingly large audience, like Animal House, American Graffiti, and Fast Times at Ridgemont High preceding them by 20 years and longer.

My husband loved it and I'm hoping to get hold of it for my 18 year old son to watch.It's not your typical comedy romance, with two attractive young stars dating in a traditional manner or having sex shortly after the opening credits. The romantic leads are both wonderful in this unusual tale, with Sally Field engaging as the young divorcée, Emma Moriarty. The amazingly charismatic James Garner plays the older widower, Murphy Jones, an affable, laid back pharmacist 30 years or so her senior. Emma has just moved to Murphy's small town to set up a horse ranch nearby with her teenage son, Jake. Murphy gives Jake a part time job at his drug store to help out the young widow, tries to send business her way, and even recommends some eligible town gents for her to date (though he clearly has his eye on Emma himself).Barely has an attraction begun between Emma and Murphy when there's 'trouble in paradise'. Emma's sexy but ne'er-do-well ex-husband, Bobby Jack, shows up, convinces Emma to let him stay with her & their son for awhile, and tries to rekindle the fire, so to speak. Of course Jake wants his dad back, so pressure is put to bear on Emma. Meanwhile, right in front of the ex, Murphy is carrying on a rather unusual courtship of Emma! He ends up staying for supper with the 'happy little family of three' nigh on just about every night, even joins them for a hand or two of cards. Bobby Jack is naturally not pleased with this turn of events, and the competition between the two of them for Emma's affections makes for some pretty witty dialogue and amusing scenes, especially at a local square dance. Also, the contrast between the two men in terms of their inner character gives Emma cause for reflection...the charming but cheating, good for nothing Bobby Jack versus the easy going but hard working, caring, and principled Murphy.

Even before the unleashing of immense power occurs, the audience has been reeled in, and is ready to fight or flee from the Martians along with the characters.When the violence does erupt (with the symbolic brutal slaying of a priest), the ensuing battle scene is a delicious movie-viewing moment. You really want the army to blast these Martian creatures to kingdom come.The character the audience usually follows (especially after the war begins) is Dr. Clayton Forrester (Gene Barry) who is not just the routine superfluous character (with boring personal problems) of recent horror films, but a scientist who is trying to solve the mystery of how the people of Earth can fight back before they're annihilated.

From Animal House and Caddyshack (the slobs versus the snobs) to John Hughes and Savage Steve Holland, to more serious fare like Six Degrees Of Separation, filmmakers have availed themselves of this last group of people they can target with a broad brush of easy scorn.Which is one reason why Whit Stillman's debut film, Metropolitan, is so refreshing. By taking a more sympathetic, inside look at a group of affluent East Side Manhattanites home from college, Stillman makes a case for an underlying core of goodness beneath the Thurston-and-Lovey veneers.Making the foray into their world for us is Tom Townsend (Edward Clements), literally and figuratively a red-headed stepchild in this world of privilege, having little money (his big secret, which he guards carefully with the help of mass transit, is that he lives on the West Side) and a defensiveness about his place in high society he manifests by adopting the stance of a disapproving socialist, though in reality he is more than a little too shallow to feel anything that deeply.The truth of Townsend is immediately obvious to members of an upscale social set that call themselves the Sally Fowler Rat Pack, but they take him in anyway because he knows their world and seems like a good audience. Running the group is Nick Smith, who you can call a snob, as well as sexist, obnoxious, and of late, rather weird. Just don't call him tiresome, or you'll get an argument.Nick is also a good guy beneath his preppie bluster, a fellow who champions Tom and breaks down Tom's highminded resistance to joining their circle with snarky logic (You'd rather stay at home and worry about the less fortunate, but has it ever occurred to you you ARE the less fortunate?) He also has real values he honors, sometimes at no small risk to his nose.

The film is tragic, exciting, suspenseful, and intelligent. From detailed depictions of the Soviet military to the rare glimpse inside the Afghan social structure, this film takes the viewer to places that few films have ever dared to venture. The film is compelling on many levels, and it will stick with you for a long time after you see it.The film centers around a five-man Soviet tank crew hopelessly lost in Afghanistan after taking part in a vicious raid on a tiny village. The survivors of the village vow to chase this tank to the edge of the earth in order to achieve badal, which is a fancy word for revenge. Steven Bauer (of Scarface fame) plays their young leader. The tank crew is led by a hard-nosed commander who would seemingly trade the lives of his crew for the safety of his tank. He's played by a slimmed-down George Dzundza who you may recognize, but not be able to name the other films he's been in. (Deer Hunter, No Mercy are a couple of them.) Also on board is an idealistic young driver played by Jason Patric. He and the commander are at odds from the very beginning, and that conflict takes a turn you would never guess at the film's outset. The tank crew and those in pursuit have numerous skirmishes as the film plays out. The film is so well-crafted that the viewer can emphasize with whatever characters are in the camera lens. We know the Soviets are pigs for the way they have behaved during their invasion, but it's amazing to see what the commander will come up with next to keep the tank running fast enough to keep them just ahead of the rebels who are hot on their tail. Scene after scene punctuates the tragic human cost of such an invasion, and the devastated lives left in its wake. The film is extraordinarily violent. Director Kevin Reynolds leaves nothing to the imagination regarding the brutality of the Soviet invaders, and the destruction that their weapons have brought to Afghanistan. The film is technically astounding in many respects. Filmed in Israel, the vast desert landscape is a beautiful but desperate backdrop for a film about the savagery of military conflict. I'll bet you won't be able to get some of the violent images out of your head for days after seeing this film. Nor will you be unable to imagine yourself in the shoes of the tank crew completely cut off from help and at the mercy of a merciless commander and an unforgiving desert. George Dzundza walks away with the film from an acting perspective. How about his line regarding their standing orders once the tank has been disabled by the rebels? As he passes out grenades to the remaining crew members he utters the unforgettable dogma Out of commission, become a pillbox; out of ammo, become a bunker out of time, become heroes....See this film. 9 of 10 stars.The Hound.

From detailed depictions of the Soviet military to the rare glimpse inside the Afghan social structure, this film takes the viewer to places that few films have ever dared to venture. The film is compelling on many levels, and it will stick with you for a long time after you see it.The film centers around a five-man Soviet tank crew hopelessly lost in Afghanistan after taking part in a vicious raid on a tiny village. The survivors of the village vow to chase this tank to the edge of the earth in order to achieve badal, which is a fancy word for revenge. Steven Bauer (of Scarface fame) plays their young leader. The tank crew is led by a hard-nosed commander who would seemingly trade the lives of his crew for the safety of his tank. He's played by a slimmed-down George Dzundza who you may recognize, but not be able to name the other films he's been in. (Deer Hunter, No Mercy are a couple of them.) Also on board is an idealistic young driver played by Jason Patric. He and the commander are at odds from the very beginning, and that conflict takes a turn you would never guess at the film's outset. The tank crew and those in pursuit have numerous skirmishes as the film plays out. The film is so well-crafted that the viewer can emphasize with whatever characters are in the camera lens. We know the Soviets are pigs for the way they have behaved during their invasion, but it's amazing to see what the commander will come up with next to keep the tank running fast enough to keep them just ahead of the rebels who are hot on their tail. Scene after scene punctuates the tragic human cost of such an invasion, and the devastated lives left in its wake. The film is extraordinarily violent. Director Kevin Reynolds leaves nothing to the imagination regarding the brutality of the Soviet invaders, and the destruction that their weapons have brought to Afghanistan. The film is technically astounding in many respects. Filmed in Israel, the vast desert landscape is a beautiful but desperate backdrop for a film about the savagery of military conflict. I'll bet you won't be able to get some of the violent images out of your head for days after seeing this film. Nor will you be unable to imagine yourself in the shoes of the tank crew completely cut off from help and at the mercy of a merciless commander and an unforgiving desert. George Dzundza walks away with the film from an acting perspective. How about his line regarding their standing orders once the tank has been disabled by the rebels? As he passes out grenades to the remaining crew members he utters the unforgettable dogma Out of commission, become a pillbox; out of ammo, become a bunker out of time, become heroes....See this film. 9 of 10 stars.The Hound.

","genre":"War"},{"date":"4 March 2006","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" There are some movies that qualify for the definition 'classic' and this is surely one.Carpenter has made a number of interesting horror\/suspense movies, but it is THE THING that truly ranks as his masterpiece.The plot is almost as old as the creature. A group of people go somewhere isolated, stumble upon something very nasty, and seem powerless to deal with it. But it is also a bit of a who-done-it, leaving the viewer to second-guess which amongst a group of suspects might be the real villain. A nice little job for Poirot.The story unfolds with some Norwegians in a helicopter chasing a runaway dog into an American Antarctic research station. After a brief skirmish both are killed. Two of the American team then fly-off to investigate the Norwegian base a few miles away, unaware that the enemy - in the form of the dog - is now already within. What they find at the Norwegian base is chaos and death, and a grotesque artifact burned and frozen in the snow. They bring it back.The artifact must be seen rather than described, and gives rise to one of those truly classic moments. It is placed on an examination table in the medical facility and unwrapped to the bald explanation 'we found this'. 'This' is not clearly seen. The camera shifts at about waist-level between the tightly clustered men, switching between tantalising glimpses of bizarre anatomy and expressions of shock and disgust amongst those assembled. One feels like a child struggling to see beyond a crowd of grown-ups, which heightens the sense of vulnerability. What can be seen is slowly thawing-out; it glistens and drips, as chilled vapour rises.The undoubted star of the show is Rob Bottin, for this and many other frightfully disturbing effects. They are all the more remarkable for a movie that predates computer-generated imaging. What you see is pretty-well what you get shocks and gore a-plenty. During my first viewing in 1982; when the infected dog's head split open, someone actually ran out of the cinema.The movie unfolds with sustained periods of slowly-building tension inter-spaced by moments of almost hallucinogenic monstrosity. As it gradually becomes evident that this thing could be anyone, members of the group no longer trust each other. That, and the stifling intimacy of small rooms and narrow corridors add to a sense of paranoia.Carpenter employed Ennio Morriconi to provide the music score. This was a wise choice because Mr Morriconi is able to dilate upon the simple themes of horror and suspense in the way that only a professional musician can, evaluating the impact that events may have upon the broader spectrum of human feelings. There is a particularly well-rendered piece during the flight to the Norwegian base, in which the helicopter is seen in long-shot against the huge expanse of frozen wilderness. The music is weighted with string instruments and imparts a sense not so much of horror as one of tragedy and despair - which is what this organism truly represents beyond our own simple fears the utter destruction of all life on earth.And where there is no music, there is the endlessly moaning wind.The set pieces are simple and entirely believable, from the cheesy common-room where you can almost smell tobacco and stale socks, to the dank frost-bound storage areas. The wrecked Norwegian base is sublimely executed. Notice the pink tinge around the block of ice from which the original fossil was apparently cut, hinting of organic tissue and unpleasant circumstances.This is, strictly speaking, a 'B' movie. It contains no 'stars' except perhaps Kurt Russell. But because of their unfamiliarity on screen, the other actors are all the more plausible as ordinary people. They are aptly chosen and play their parts with understated conviction. Radically, it is an all-male cast, so there is non of the 'romantic' digression expected in most other movies. You are given nothing else to consider but the creature and how to deal with it, just like the actors themselves. This focuses thought and draws you into their dilemma.Horror aside, if you're into thought-provoking science fiction, this is the stuff. The most disturbing element for me was the realisation that such an organism could exist. An anti-virus this is one that instead of changing host cells into copies of itself, rather assumes a similitude of the organism instead, thereby also inheriting its intelligence. Such a thing could leap 4 billion years of evolution with just one single infection. Imagine HIV with a 3-figure IQ; truly, the stuff of nightmares. I've docked a point because I am fed-up with Hollywood helicopters that apparently can't hover. The Norwegians could have done this and simply shot and bombed the dog to hell. I also think that someone on the American team would have considered putting the animal into quarantine, at least until more was known. After all, the Norwegians would hardly be chasing it for fun. It might perhaps have had rabies. And all animals - including humans - have fleas, lice, or just skin mites. These would likewise be infected and infectious. Then, being nosey, I wanted to see inside the spaceship. Finally, check-out the scene where the monster has absorbed the other dogs and throws-up two big arms to punch a hole in the roof. As it hauls itself up, you hear the sound of a squeaky winch or block-and-tackle, which one suspects is what they used to lift it; but whoever forgot to oil the wheels also forgot to edit-out the noise.The quirky ending suggested a sequel, but - for whatever reason - it never happened (good job Sigourney Weaver wasn't in it).Don't dwell on my nit-picking though; this is definitely a collector's item. In half a century, movie buffs will still be talking about THE THING.

After you've seen it once, think about it a little bit and then wait a little while and see it again...that is how good this flick is!

Directed by journeyman studio veteran Irving Rapper, it's an unabashed, only-in-Hollywood soap opera with Bette Davis at the peak of her popularity as she evolves from a distraught, overweight spinster to a glamorous Boston society social maven in about ten minutes. Probably to Tom Cruise's horror, it's also a big valentine to the positive effects of psychoanalysis, a new science which must have been viewed with a great deal of skepticism at the time. Yet for all its plot contrivances - and there are quite a few - this is ultimately sublime entertainment thanks mainly to the stellar performances and the simple fact that the story is never dull.The plot focuses on heiress Charlotte Vale, a walking disaster of sheltered neurosis in sensible shoes and a virtual slave to one of the most dominating mothers in screen history. Charlotte's concerned sister-in-law Lisa brings Dr. Jaquith to the Vale mansion where he convinces Charlotte to seek psychiatric treatment at a posh sanitarium. Although still insecure after she leaves on a life-altering pleasure cruise, she finds inevitable romance with architect Jerry Durrance, who of course is married to an unstable woman. Overcome with guilt and breaking an engagement to an available prospect, Charlotte returns to the sanitarium, where she meets troubled young Tina, who of course turns out to be Jerry's daughter. From this ultimate contrivance, plot threads get sewn together in short order, cigarettes lit under the moonlight and Davis coos her big line, Don't let's ask for the moon; we have the stars. In what amounts to a showcase for her versatility, Davis is superb in both before and after modes, even playing a romantic shipboard teenager with sincerity in a flashback sequence. Paul Henried plays Jerry with requisite Continental charm, but he is truly overmatched by Davis in their scenes together. Claude Rains fares better in the pivotal role of Dr. Jaquith providing his medical advice with convincing paternal authority and genuine warmth. Gladys Cooper - who would play the far warmer mother of Henry Higgins in My Fair Lady two decades later - portrays Charlotte's iron-willed mother in a sharply uncompromising manner befitting the intimidating stature she holds in the family. Broadway luminary Ilka Chase is fine in one of her few screen appearances as sympathetic Lisa, and Bonita Granville - grown-up since her sinister turn as the rumor-mongering child in William Wyler's These Three seven years earlier - plays the bratty niece June with enthusiasm. The print condition on the DVD is excellent, though there are no other extras included.

Bull, I say! The film (directed by George Miller) is a extremely intense tale of a post-apocalyptic world that takes place sometime after the collapse of civilization (don't ya hate when that happens?). A world where anarchy, violence, death, and sometimes very bad taste in wardrobe reign as roaming bands of marauders (always roaming, always in bands) kill for what's left of the remaining stores of gasoline. Now that's just the set-up in this second film of what, at least to this day, remains a trilogy that began with the incredibly manic Mad Max (1979) and the third, and slightly lame ( Remember those frigging' stupid kids? How about Tina Turner? What the *bleep*, eh?!!!) entry Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, which is still pretty good even though it turned into more of a 80's Indiana Jones and the Lost Children of Never, never-land type o' adventure.Now, there ain't much in the plot department, but gives a crap when there's so much carnage and bizarre stuff to sit through, drooling as you're witness to some of the most spectacular car crashes put on film (even by todays standards as far as I'm concerned)! I mean WOW! What a *bleeping* movie! It's like an apocalyptic western\/samurai car crash hold-no-barred hardcore experience like no other. Except, of course, for the billion knock-offs that followed, some of which, like the ridiculously bad yet somehow awesome Metalstorm (which is, as the makers of that film explain, not a rip-off AT ALL cause, even though it takes place in the future, it's on another planet!!! Oh yeah?!!! Then what's with the lead dude's very strong resemblance to Max?!! Ya dumb bastards!!!).Anyhoo, when you watch The Road Warrior, you're not looking for plot or story (although it's there, and it's good tale of redemption as far as I'm concerned), you're looking for cars that crash and go boom. And this flick's got 'em. It's main set-piece is an astonishing well-sustained chase sequence involving Max, a beat-to-frigging-crap semi and a long damn road . It's like that scene in Clint Eastwood's The Gauntlet, but way faster! It's still the best chase sequence EVER! And screw all you Matrix Reloaded fans if ya disagree!!!The only thing these films RIP you on is the T&A! I found, and still find, this film to exhilarating and I never, never tire of it. I have enjoyed every minute, every second, every frame of this picture. Many times. In Pauline Kael's case, my guess as to why she didn't enjoy it is that she has no wiener. I mean no disrespect, I like her writing. It's just that, as I've been reading through her reviews lately (I manage to find a used copy of one of her review books and decided to check it as I've heard a lot about her) I find that Kael and I do NOT have the same tastes in film. But then again, what do you expect from someone who couldn't appreciate great films such as Raiders of the Lost Ark and Return of the Jedi? I've read that Tarantino is a big fan of her work and I haft to wonder&#133;why? She'd totally hate his movies!!! From what I've read she seems to hate almost anything that's a guy flick. I'm not just a guy flick watching, uh&#133;guy, either (not all the time, anyway). I like the mushier, sensitive, more thought provoking crap, too. I like a good, well-told love story every now and then. But you're not gonna find it watching The Road Warrior. And you're not gonna find much that's thought provoking either and if you were hoping, what the hell were you thinking?!!! As for Ebert, I forgive him, cause he seems to at least get it.The Road Warrior is one of the greatest picture of all time (at least on my list) and some might be snobbish and say it's story is almost non-existent (and I won't disagree with ya there) and that's there's no point to it, really, but not every film HAS TO HAVE a point. It's an experience, pure and (in this case, very) simple. My only hope is that if they indeed make a fourth in the series (and end it) that the filmmakers make Max's end, and this may seem corny, a happy one where he's not left on those bleak blacktops wandering the wastelands forever alone.

Oh yeah, and that notorious scene at the beginning where the guy is sent down a waterfall is bound to a cross.That scene, of mixed horror and spellbinding beauty, is a lot of what The Mission is like. Being as critical as possible, The Mission is one of the greatest, and certainly one of the most beautiful films ever made.The synopsis The setting is the 17th Century, South America. Our Protagonist is Jeremy Irons, a priest who, unlike the Hollywood stereotype of villanous priest, is really quite pacifist - Ghandi-style. I generally find Christians annoying, but I might just get along with this guy. He sets off, alone in the jungle, to start a mission to try and convert the natives to Christianity. He climbs the cliffs next to the waterfall and at the top runs into some naturals and manages to avoid becoming the guy in the opening scene by playing an Ennio Morricone theme on his oboe. Another character has to come into play here, and its Robert DeNiro. After Irons has successfully set up a small mission and befriended most of the naturals, he runs into DeNiro, a slave trader who takes some of the naturals captive. This time the camera follows DeNiro who inevitably kills his brother in a fit of jealousy. When Irons meets him later in jail, he is ready for redemption, so Irons, and another priest played by some guy called Liam Neeson (!) take him up the cliffs with them, DeNiro carrying a huge pack of armor. DeNiro mercilessly drags himself up out of self hatred. After making it to the top (barely) he feels redeemed and becomes a priest of the mission.I won't tell you the rest of the plot, but it involves Irons, DeNiro and young Liam trying to save the mission from Portuguese soldiers who would like to solve the problem of the naturals by enslaving them.The Mission was made by the people who made The Killing Fields which is a great film, but not as great as this. If Chris Menges' photography in The Killing Fields was pretty, in The Mission its stunning. If Roland Joffe(director) had an Axe to grind in The Killing Fields, he has an army of axes to grind here. If Haing Ngor was great in The Killing Fields...well, DeNiro is maybe not quite as great as Ngor, but still worthy of a huge amount of attention.And The Mission had a WAY better score than Star Wars ","genre":null},{"date":"4 March 2006","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" (This will be the first of 30 essays on films that I believe are the 30 greatest of all time.
