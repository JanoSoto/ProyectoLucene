The problem with this criticism is that, in the case of Fight Club, the movie's message is not confused. It knows exactly what it's saying; but many people don't.Not only do some people jump to the conclusion that Fight Club is condoning violent or sociopathic behavior, but they think it's condoning fascism and terrorism, when it's actually outright mocking it. It's showing the juvenile pointlessness of it. Not only do some people miss that it's satirizing the teenage-rebellion mentality, but they assume it's pandering to it.Fight Club is the story of two people representing two extremes the Narrator, a white-collar worker who's become a slave to consumerism and the social construct around him, and the other is Tyler Durden, a violent nihilist with no regard for society or others, who feels the human race has been emasculated by materialism and advertising. Essentially, these two are exact opposites. But as the two of them become friends, they start an underground boxing club for the catharsis of people who feel just as trapped and emotionally apathetic as they do. Ultimately, Tyler takes this entire concept and evolves it into Project Mayhem, a group devoted to vandalism and general mischief, but from there, it actively grows into a terrorist organization.The thing that SHOULD be the giveaway that it's not promoting this behavior is through the DEATH of an innocent man as the result of these actions, and the fact that we see the misguided members of Project Mayhem lose their personal identities to a dangerous cult mentality. I said it once and I'll say it again Project Mayhem and their violent beliefs are not being condoned. And yet, to give you an idea of just how much the themes in Fight Club are taken out of context, there was a real-life incident with a kid in Manhattan who, influenced by the movie, attempted to blow up a Starbucks, as the Space Monkeys are seen doing in this movie. Of course, despite how obvious it was that this behavior was being mocked in the movie (and, once again, how they show an innocent man get killed as a result), authorities proceeded to scapegoat this movie, as if it was the fault of the film itself that someone foolishly misinterpreted the message and attempted an act of terrorism. The film blatantly portrays Tyler Durden as a fascist and a terrorist, and yet, people actually think it's promoting him, simply because it doesn't outright tell you what to think. Fight Club is attacked by everyone from politically correct New-Agers and prudish moralists with mantras of ZOMG THIS MOVEEZ VIOLINZ FOR THE STOOPID TEENAEGERS LOLZ!11 (and of course, shouted down by so-called cinephiles for being unconventional in nature, and for being a Hollywood film). I recommend actually thinking this film over instead of going by knee-jerk reaction. If the things that happen in this movie disturb you (especially the ending), then good. They SHOULD disturb you. In short Fight Club is condoning Tyler Durden's actions and beliefs as much as Schindler's List is condoning the Holocaust.Of course, that's my take on how the message is misconstrued, so what else does Fight Club have to offer? Well, as you'd expect from Fincher, it's a remarkable-looking movie, and the actors make the absolute best of it. It's consistently funny, full of unforgettable characters and dialogue, and most of all, it captures the world and feel of Generation X quite unlike any movie I've ever seen. But therein lies something fascinating it's the absolute film for its time and place, yet it doesn't feel dated at all. The reason, I theorize, is because it does such an outstanding job of making you a part of the time in which it's set, and giving us something timeless to think about.So what, in my opinion, is the true message of Fight Club? Fight Club is--and this is important--NOT telling you what to think. It's simply asking you to reflect, question things. Question society, question the false prophets.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"2 August 2010","score":"","review":" I watched the film The Breakfast Club which was made in the year 1985. This movie really revolves around the typical stereotypes that we are all aware are created during those tough high school years. There are five teenagers that are the main characters in this film who all end up in detention together and there they actually learn more about themselves and the others around them than they ever learned before. Some major characters in this film that are worth mention were Emilio Estevez who played Andy Clark, Molly Ringwald who played Claire Standish, Ally Sheedy who played Allison Reynolds and Judd Nelson who played John Bender. I think the theme of this movie revolved greatly around the letter that was written instead of the essay. The letter changed in many ways, yet by the end of the movie it showed to all involved and to the principal that each person is viewed differently, by all involved and by the principal himself. The theme also involved no matter what they found out about each other or revealed to each other, most of the time, teenagers will revert back to their old ways that they are comfortable with, which is what some or most did and do. I think if I had to compare the theme of stereotyping to another movie I could do that easily to the movie Crash that I viewed a little while back. I think the same type of stereotyping of people is used in that film to portray what people truly think of each other and how their thoughts and feelings change as they go back to their normal lives. I believe the angle and lighting were both very important and portrayed very well in this film. The most important scenes took place in detention in the school library where the lighting truly showed how the room was bright and vibrant and even let the sun shine in so that they could all see what they were missing outside by being in trouble that day. It is not at all gloomy which I think is the way it should be due to the nature of what the students are discussing and trying to unravel about each other. I think that the lighting and angle helped to make the theme more believable where most people viewing the movie would begin to think what it might be like in that library on a Saturday when they should be out having fun.

","genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller"},{"date":"2 August 2010","score":"2 out of 11 people found the following review useful","review":" The most famous conspiracy of all time gets the big-screen treatment and boy, what a treatment it is. Famed and controversial filmmaker Oliver Stone appeared to be in way over his head with JFK, pouring what probably amounts to decades of investigation and research into three-plus hours of screen time, enough to convince even the most stringent of government sympathizers that Lee Harvey Oswald could not have possibly assassinated President John F. Kennedy.Even if you're not a fan of historical conspiracy, if you appreciate film you'll be blown away by the technical precision of Stone's effort. The conspiracy itself does guide much of the film's run time (that's not to detract from its powerful ideological arguments between characters), so it can be weighty for those who don't enjoy the learning aspect. However, the masterful blend of contemporary scenes and archive footage give JFK an unparalleled documentary-like feel.The use of various cameras, lenses and film stock makes a lot of the film's footage appear to be archive footage, so naturally it's hard to distinguish fact from fiction, but the result is more fascinating than confusing. Whole sections of the film belong to two monologues Jim Garrison's (Kevin Costner) closing argument to the jury at the film's end and the mysterious source X (Donald Sutherland) explaining to Garrison how the Department of Defense, FBI and CIA all could have collaborated to carry out the assassination. Without mixing in compelling visuals, these scenes would consist only of talking heads. Not only do these visuals work, but they also make sense. It's no wonder cinematography and editing were the two victories JFK scored at the Academy Awards.Although Stone's focus is the material itself, the characters are still compelling. The story centers around New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison, who three years after the assassination has an epiphany and opens the first investigation of the president's murder, finding it impossible to believe that Oswald (Gary Oldman) alone could have fired three shots from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository and been successful.The film delves a bit into Garrison's family life, which shows how his obsession with the case has hurt his family and upset his wife. Sounds pretty typical, but the writing from Stone and Zachary Sklar creates such deep empathy that you understand exactly where each character comes from. The same happens in the other dramatic scenes between Garrison and the people he questions or Garrison and members of his investigative team that begin to question the whole thing. Costner is downright believable and you're with him and behind him every step of the way.The rest of the cast is flooring. There are a number of cameos and small parts filmed by huge names. There's everyone from the tandem of Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon (not together however) to Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, Kevin Bacon and Sissy Spacek to John Candy. When you watch a film that has so many excellent faces appear for brief minutes, you get the sense that the film is important. Any script that draws in that many names must be special and JFK is. The film occasionally loses itself in all the conspiracy exposition, but anyone who finds it interesting will discover the seemingly insurmountable run time much easier to handle than expected.

And the film is more fun than one could ask for, natch, but its real surprise is that, rather than simply a guilty pleasure, it isn't half bad in any regard, boasting enough of a brain and thematic backbone to, in combination with its combustible mayhem, easily cement it as a genre classic. Boasting one of the most impressive genre resumes in cinema history, director John McTiernan certainly knows his salt in terms of hard-thwacking, supremely satisfying action and Predator, one of his earliest offerings, consistently fires on all cylinders. McTiernan is wise enough to concentrate on the minutiae within the bombastic, dwelling as much on details such as exactly how the team members strap on their weapons, cock their heads to listen for threatening sounds or sing songs to themselves to quench nerves coming away as just as memorable as any explosive showdowns. Such an attention to detail is what truly elevates the film from the chaff, with a painstakingly creeping sense of peril and dread leaving the audience constantly scrutinizing background trees, the soft crinkle of ferns, the hiss of breathing and any unexpected movement as the film stalks away from the familiar comfort of civilization into the horrific isolation of an alien jungle. For its use of sound alone, the film should be considered a classic of horror as well as action. With its claustrophobic arousal of tension, the film is unquestionably indebted to Spielberg's Jaws, the Predator's infra-red POV fittingly substituting for the lurking underwater shark cameras, yet in many ways the film eerily foreshadows aspects of Spielberg's Jurassic Park, bringing the cycle of influence (whether conscious or not) full circle. To mention McTiernan's film in the same breath as such classics is no accident, as he cannily utilizes such established conventions to bend viewer expectations and sympathies (it is worth noticing who the audience is 'watching' at what point during the film, alternatively aligned with Dutch or the Predator, making traditionally black and white sympathies murky) to draw them in all the more. While the film may lag a bit near the middle, with several 'apprehensively wandering through the jungle' scenes feeling extraneous, to say nothing of the genre cliché unapologetically yet clumsily speckled throughout (Stick around! smirks Dutch as he fastens an enemy soldier to a door with a knife), it is exceedingly rare to see such astute talent and focus dedicated to a film which could easily have been written off as an expendable B- feature. Of course any good 'creature feature' would be nothing without its antagonist, and the Predator itself is a spectacular creation. An ingeniously inventive design, from invisibility- yielding chameleon armour to sinister clicking call to its fusion of the organic and technological, the Predator is a force of almost every antagonistic nature combined, and, chillingly enough, in the fleeting segments the audience is left alone with it, shown to be a more sophisticated extrapolation of the testosterone-pumped yahoos of Dutch's team that it hunts. Though it may be a stretch, the Predator can be seen to represent the essence of 'manhood', the masculine ideal, steadily overcoming all other semblances of machismo represented by Dutch's team and absorbing them into itself, taking skins, spines and heads for the sake of proving itself. As odd as it may seem to consider Arnold Schwarzenegger an example of progressive masculinity, Dutch, while introduced in a flurry of cigars, bulging biceps and one-liners as just as an example of the same kind of cocky manhood as his team, is the only male in the film willing to depart from the usual role of hyper-physical masculine, privileging running from the Predator for the sake of protecting his men rather than pursuing it on a macho vendetta like the rest of his team. McTiernan's introduction of Anna, the only female in the film is particularly interesting reduced to a nearly nonexistent role, she serves primarily to articulate the attitudes of the men around her. While the majority of the team instinctively try to repress or conquer her (the Predator outright ignores her, opting instead for fellow machismo to overpower), Dutch is the only one to give Anna her say, trust her and release her. It is only through these departures of traditional masculinity that Dutch can defeat its epitome, the Predator (complete with an ironic, mockingly vaginal face), which, fittingly enough, destroys itself when Dutch demonstrates mercy towards it, unable to accept its defeat by a less primal form of manhood. In terms of performance, apart from said occasional one-liner, Schwarzenegger is refreshingly reserved, delivering, in spite of himself, a performance of credible steely focus and rough compassion, a fitting emotional anchor for such a grisly film. Similarly, Bill Duke is excellent as solemn soldier Mac, as adept at delivering a grim whisper as a heartbroken sob, and injecting the film with raw compassion and heartbreak. Jesse Ventura also stands out as the most gung-ho of the pack, his brazen tobacco spitting (This stuff will make you a goddamned sexual tyrannosaurus!), minigun-toting Blain providing the definitive final word on good, old fashioned, macho posturing. Whether appraised for its underlying sociological group interactions, gender politics, or simply the volume of gasps and explosions, Predator proves difficult to beat on the action\/thriller front. Impeccably constructed and fun as can be, McTiernan's film is a must- see for all those capable of stomaching exploding heads and\/or Schwarzenegger's sizable biceps. -9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"2 August 2010","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" With a premise reducible as 'Schwarzenegger vs. superpowered alien in jungle from the director of Die Hard', it would seem a given that Predator could hardly be less than a rip- snorting good time.

In the movie Shower, from mainland China's Xian Film Studio directed by Yang Zhang (Spicy Love Soup), this dichotomy of the new and the old is symbolized by the shower and the bath. The shower is a fast convenience that takes water for granted while the bath and especially the bathhouse is a tranquil way of life. Master Liu (Zhu Xu also in King of Masks) is owner of such an establishment where you can bathe, get a massage, get treatments like cupping, get a manicure, play Xiangqi (Chinese Chess), or challenge local patrons to cricket fighting. It is analogous to a men's club (or Cheers) where regulars come to relax as well as socialize (and everybody knows your name as well as your problems). Liu lives with his mentally slow son Er Ming (wonderfully played by Jiang Wu) who helps out with the daily chores.Shower starts off with an idea by bathhouse denizen He Zheng of an automated shower (reminds me of the automated restrooms in large cities like San Francisco or the suicide booths in Futurama) where you pay your money and get put through an automatic human wash that sprays soap, water and scrubs you to a healthy clean. It is a clever idea by a slacker whose entrepreneurial ideas tend to fizzle and who still needs to fix the neon sign for the bathhouse. It is entirely appropriate that he is telling this idea while relaxing in the caldarium.The drama begins when Da Ming (Pu Cunxin), son of Liu, comes to visit from Shenzhen after an extended absence. He came after misinterpreting a postcard that Er Ming sent that seemed to show the death of his father. While Liu was happy to see him he then realized the only reason his son came to visit because he thought he was dead. Da Ming decides to stay for a few days though his faster pace existence is evident by the fact he only takes showers now and not baths. Things have changes so much between them at one point that Liu wishes his son had not even shown up (though at this point Da Ming had lost his younger brother while buying a ticket home).The distant relationship between Liu and Da Ming is counterbalanced between the beautifully simple and close relationship between Er Ming and Liu. Liu takes care of him but allows Er Ming to help out with the business and even exercises with him. It is a touching kinship that seems realistic and not forced. Da Ming is awed by this bond. He has spent so much time away that he is an estranged prodigal son. The biggest strength of this film is it's characterization. There are many wonderful supporting roles in this film. There is the impotent Zhang and his shrewish wife. There are the bickering cricket trainers and fighters (including Mr. Wu who has possibly used illegal substances to beef up his cricket.) There is Miao Zhuang who loves to sing Eduardo Di Capua and Giovanni Capurro's O Sole Mio in the shower. And He Zheng the daydreamer who owes lots of money. I am quite impressed by how well all of their lives are interconnected throughout many of the subplots.Small spoiler in this paragraph I do no have much to complain about this film (other than the multitude of men's buttocks shown). It would seem that the impending doom of the district, including the bathhouse, to be replaced by a shopping mall would seem a contrite stereotypical plot device but for Beijing and the surrounding areas it is really happening. I did think one scene involving Er Ming and a hospital felt forced and tried to be too emotionally manipulative, but that was probably the only moment that I felt was mediocre..The central theme to this movie is water. There is an emotional flashback scene where Liu talks about Er Ming's mother from the northern province and how much families had to sacrifice just to get enough water for the daughter to take a bath before her wedding day. Water is a purifying force. When Mr. Zhang had problems with impotence it was solved with a special potion and a bath. When Miao Zhuang could not sing in front of the neighborhood, water was used to cure this disorder. Water is also a destructive force. The only death took place in water. Er Ming used a water hose to disrupt a moving party. It is also a healing force Liu and Da Ming made peace during a storm. In the film water is analogous to life. The wooden plaque at the end of the film sums up the movie with the aqueous statement Heaven Shower's Us With Blessings.Shower is one of my favorite mainland Chinese films. It is bittersweet, poignant, funny yet emotional complex movie I have watched several times. There is no sugary-sweet ending so it feels more natural. What stays with me though is the memory of the characters and how they remind me of characters that frequent every archaic establishment. Personal note I may be biased for this film in certain aspects because I used to manage an arcade that was eventually torn down to make way for a larger parking lot.

Da Ming decides to stay for a few days though his faster pace existence is evident by the fact he only takes showers now and not baths. Things have changes so much between them at one point that Liu wishes his son had not even shown up (though at this point Da Ming had lost his younger brother while buying a ticket home).The distant relationship between Liu and Da Ming is counterbalanced between the beautifully simple and close relationship between Er Ming and Liu. Liu takes care of him but allows Er Ming to help out with the business and even exercises with him. It is a touching kinship that seems realistic and not forced. Da Ming is awed by this bond. He has spent so much time away that he is an estranged prodigal son. The biggest strength of this film is it's characterization. There are many wonderful supporting roles in this film. There is the impotent Zhang and his shrewish wife. There are the bickering cricket trainers and fighters (including Mr. Wu who has possibly used illegal substances to beef up his cricket.) There is Miao Zhuang who loves to sing Eduardo Di Capua and Giovanni Capurro's O Sole Mio in the shower. And He Zheng the daydreamer who owes lots of money. I am quite impressed by how well all of their lives are interconnected throughout many of the subplots.Small spoiler in this paragraph I do no have much to complain about this film (other than the multitude of men's buttocks shown). It would seem that the impending doom of the district, including the bathhouse, to be replaced by a shopping mall would seem a contrite stereotypical plot device but for Beijing and the surrounding areas it is really happening. I did think one scene involving Er Ming and a hospital felt forced and tried to be too emotionally manipulative, but that was probably the only moment that I felt was mediocre..The central theme to this movie is water. There is an emotional flashback scene where Liu talks about Er Ming's mother from the northern province and how much families had to sacrifice just to get enough water for the daughter to take a bath before her wedding day. Water is a purifying force. When Mr. Zhang had problems with impotence it was solved with a special potion and a bath. When Miao Zhuang could not sing in front of the neighborhood, water was used to cure this disorder. Water is also a destructive force. The only death took place in water. Er Ming used a water hose to disrupt a moving party. It is also a healing force Liu and Da Ming made peace during a storm. In the film water is analogous to life. The wooden plaque at the end of the film sums up the movie with the aqueous statement Heaven Shower's Us With Blessings.Shower is one of my favorite mainland Chinese films. It is bittersweet, poignant, funny yet emotional complex movie I have watched several times. There is no sugary-sweet ending so it feels more natural. What stays with me though is the memory of the characters and how they remind me of characters that frequent every archaic establishment. Personal note I may be biased for this film in certain aspects because I used to manage an arcade that was eventually torn down to make way for a larger parking lot. The amount of diverse characters there, like in Shower, was immense.

Most have already seen and understand the beauty of Gordon Willis' black-and-white photography of New York City, the inspired wit and sophistication of Allen and Marshall Brickman's script, and the fine line Allen walks in directing between tragedy and comedy. Yet, how can I share in words how great an experience this film is? A psychiatrist could have a field day trying to dissect and analyze all the subconscious and hidden feelings and motivations that occur between the three main adult characters, but what it really breaks down to is that Isaac, Yale and Mary represent a part of nearly every human being that has or will attempt to start and maintain some sort of healthy and meaningful relationship. None of them seem to have the ability to share their feelings without any hindrance or caution at all; they all hide behind their own insecurities and excuses. In most romantic comedies today, these insecurities would be the central aspect of the characters; we would notice their acting out rather than their true agenda. Here, Allen is comfortable enough with the material to let the actors shine through and deeply express what each person really wants, or thinks they want.That being said, the acting here might be the best of any Woody Allen movie. Allen is great by toning down his usual stand-up persona and allowing the character of Isaac to really seep in and show himself as more than just neurotic and slightly narcissistic. Michael Murphy as Yale is also very good, somehow able to command our sympathy for someone who just might be the most unlikable person in all of Manhattan. But, Diane Keaton as the intellect Mary with enough personal issues to make Freud buy a new couch really steals the show and is in my mind, Keaton's best performance in a long and wonderful career. Her monologues when she discusses art and culture indicate someone who has learned all that is unnecessary to really live life. Indeed, Isaac even alludes to this, saying she truly knows nothing of what it means to feel like a person.There is also something extraordinary in the music Allen uses, particularly Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue. The film bookends with magnificent wide-angle shots of the overview of Manhattan and the music adds to the cinematography to create a feeling of wonder and awe; how can a city this terrific and life-changing be available to all of us to visit? This is really a love letter to NYC and having not been there before, I cannot express now how much I want to go if only to visit the museums and theaters and parks these people have available at their will.I cannot end this review without pointing to Mariel Hemingway's Oscar-nominated performance as Tracy, the 17-year old high-schooler who is the most honest and forthright of all the characters in her feelings and expressions. Perhaps Allen feels innocence and naiveté are the best form of allowing yourself to be honest. Her performance balances out the zaniness of the three leads and the final scene between her and Allen really strikes a note rarely seen in movies, much less romantic comedies. Roger Ebert said this is a film not about love in the present but love in the past; realizing you've lost a good thing and cannot recover. This is Allen's deepest regret and it is a testimony to help us understand that in every relationship we attempt, this outcome always lingers as a possibility.

This film also contains great acting performances from all the cast, mainly Naomi Watts, who is captivating as she switches between multiple facets of her character, Justin Theroux who is perfect as the casting director, and Laura Harring, who gives a darkly sexual performance as the woman with amnesia. This movie is a must-watch for the intelligent film-goer, it stands apart with a certain group of films from the recycled Hollywood garbage that people watch today. Mulholland Dr. is a work of art, it isn't meant to be interpreted logically scene after scene but rather an experience of the mind, as if unraveling the mysteries of a sinister puzzle box.

I wasn't expecting much, as had no real interest in David Lynch, ( at that time i had only seen Dune, which was a pretty crappy movie to be honest). Well after watching the movie I had left feeling awestruck. I was mesmerized by its non-linear and confusing film noir-narrative. But I was still left in a daze of what the hell it all meant. This was my first Lynch film, so i wasn't prepared for the weirdness that transpired. First thing I did after watching Mulholland Dr. was that I went and logged into my computer, 'googled' it and read several theories on how people deciphered the film. I later regret doing this, as Mulholland Dr. is a film for you, the viewer, to draw your own conclusions on. This picture merits countless viewing and requires careful focus to catch all the clues and hidden themes.

Since Mr. Hitchcock had already directed another English film, Secret Agent, the title was changed to Sabotage, not to be confused with Saboteur, which the director made in America in 1942, which is not a remake. The achievement of this film is tremendous, even when the viewer knows from the start who the evil character is. Mr. Hitchcock pulled it off in surprising, and simple ways, that paid off handsomely in this thriller, that in spite of having been made more than 74 years ago, still merits a view by fans of the director. Mr. Hitchcock knew how to keep the suspense, as he proved here. The viewer is kept at the edge of his seat as one watches Stevie, the young boy going on to deliver the bomb, that unknown to him, his brother-in-law thought would surely go to its intended target. Because of the parade, and not being able to cross the street by the police barricade, he has no other way to get to Picadilly by taking the bus as time gets closer to the deadline of 1.45pm.The other fantastic sequence involves the killing of Verloc. It is done without any sound, practically, yet, the impact it creates in our minds is nothing short of shocking because, basically, Sylvia Verloc, cannot believe the monster she has married, could be the one responsible for the death of her own brother. The ironic twist at the end comes unexpectedly at the end without even a hint of what is going to happen to the Bijou when all the evil doer is trapped inside the apartment trying to retrieve the bird cages.Sylvia Sidney made a wonderful Mrs. Verloc. She is not the typical blond the director favored, but she brought a great presence to the film. Oskar Homolka underplayed his Verloc to an amazing effect. He is menacing without doing much, which goes to show what good actor he was. John Loder is seen as Ted, the undercover agent assigned to watch what was going on at the theater next door. Diamond Tester added a touch of innocence to the action; we all know he is a good kid who did not deserve his tragic end.Sabotage is vintage Hitchcock that must be seen by serious fans.

Fortunately, the black community has its own underground group, known as The B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D. created to undermine The Man's plans to Whitewash the world.Eddie Griffin stars as Undercover Brother, a funky '70s throwback hero with a huge Afro and platform shoes, who drives around in a pimped-out Caddy performing acts of Kung-Fu derring-do to aid the African American cause. Normally a lone wolf, he is drafted into the B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D. when a black war hero (Billy Dee Williams)'s plans to run for President are derailed by a mind control drug designed by The Man.

I'm not sure, but as one of my favorite films, I'll give it a try. Most of the film Casablanca takes place in Rick's Café Americain &#x96; a nightclub in the Moroccan city of Casablanca that lends itself to people looking for a way to escape the Nazis; these can include refugees, gamblers, even crooks. Rick's is owned by Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart). Rick has gone to Casablanca to escape the Nazi's, a lost love and sticks his neck out for no one. The plot centers on some letters of transit that have been given to Rick for safe keeping. The letters will allow the bearer to escape to the United States, and freedom. Unknown to Rick is that these papers are the reason that his lost love Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) and her husband Victor (Paul Henreid) find their way into Rick's nightclub. Rick is torn between using the papers for him to get out of Casablanca and take Ilsa with him, or give the papers to the couple, so that they can escape the Nazis. Also central to the story line is the song As Time Goes By, a song that was special to Ilsa and Rick during their romance in Paris. Rick has forbid Sam (Dooley Wilson) his piano player to play the song since Ilsa left him alone at the train station in Paris. When Ilsa and Victor come into the club, Ilsa convinces Sam to Play It Again Sam, Play It Again. When Rick hears it, he is furious, until he sees who requested the song. Thus begins the revival of Rick and Ilsa's love affair. Even though by today's standards the scenery and special effects are outdated and at times seem corny, it doesn't detract from the charm, romance, mystery and allure of the story of the film. The lighting and camera angles used to shoot the film contribute to the mystery and allure of the city of Casablanca as well. This can specifically be seen in the lighting and camera angles used for the close-ups of Ilsa. The soft, diffused lighting on her face, gives her an almost angelic quality. The emotions are so evident in her expressions, especially her eyes. While watching this film, the lighting used, reminded me of another of Ingrid Bergman's later films, The Bells of St. Mary's. The lighting used seemed to be similar, and in The Bells of St. Mary's, Ms. Bergman played a nun, so she was angelic in a way. I found that the film Casablanca still held the same allure, mystery and romantic adventure after viewing it for the 20th time as it held the first time.

He has two people he is desperate to impress &#x96; a friendly elevator girl, played by Shirley MacLaine, and his suave, unscrupulously boss, played by Fred MacMurray. What starts out as a cute film takes a dark turn, with some moments involving suicide that made me genuinely uncomfortable. Shop Around the Corner came to mind as I watched it, only instead of a handful of kind characters, we're left with Jack Lemmon as the one decent person in the film. Any pleasure derived from this film will largely depend on the viewers' opinion of him. I found him appealing, but I could also understand someone finding his jittery style too annoying to tolerate. This is a well-written romantic comedy that is at once sweet and cynical in tone, one that does not skip over the darker human emotions and tendencies. As I watched it I found myself unable to keep from smiling at some points and ready to cry at others. It isn't a romance between two gorgeous people who in the real world could have anyone they wanted. The romantic leads are two cheerful nobodies who are used to struggling while watching others succeed. Their vulnerability makes for a less fun romantic comedy, but a touching one nonetheless.

There is no reason not to like it. The songs are great, the characters are some of the most likable in history, it never feels slow, and it is just so entertaining. The effects for the time were great. The colors are bright and energetic. Do I really need to say anything about this film. People have said that they love it for years and they will continue for years. It is one of my favorites also. It brings a smile to my face watching it. It makes me feel good to be part of something that is passed down from generation to generation like a baseball glove that belonged to your grandfather, or a ring that belonged to your grandmother. It feels like something that brings us together. We are all brought together through this classic.4 stars out of 4 ","genre":null},{"date":"2 August 2010","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Wizard of Oz is a timeless classic.

This lacks subtlety, and subtlety along with gusto is what the film was most in need. If this was intended in tune with other quasi-farcical moments, it was a ghastly error.An improbable phone-call between Ouisa and Paul muddles whatever premise and goes on forever. That much for dramatic economy.Yet Channing and Sutherland shine through, and Channing gives a tour-de-force in a nutshell during her final, small monologue, which may well be the film's moment. Afterwards smacking with a stupid closure (slapping a tree's leaves the way she did the moment of creation between God and Adam at the Sistine Chapel) of a ho-hum symbolic-and-so-manhattanite-released conclusion.This sounds worse than it is, and maybe it is, going from extreme, supposed subtlety, some good, very good lines, to cardboard situations and skimmed if not skipped direction. Watch it for its good moments and since the word imagination garlands the film with some of its best lines, imagine the film it could have been.
