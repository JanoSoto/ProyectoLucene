This detracts from the emotional involvement required to get the maximum impact. I personally didn't even believe that Sophia was remotely real and was quite surprised to discover that she did, in fact, exist.Stories of this nature are more satisfyingly terrifying when the ultimate basis of the main character's experience is psychological. Unwilling to go all the way, the makers of this movie draw the tooth of insanity by creating a pseudo-science fiction explanation for all that has gone before. As is frequently the case when people not fully versed in the genre attempt science fiction, this story has a gaping logical hole in it, which need be plugged only with a single line of explanatory dialogue which was not forthcoming. We are all familiar with the concept of cryogenic freezing of a corpse after death, with the idea of being revived in the distant future when the battle against death itself has been won by our descendants. But this film takes the idea one step further - that you can spend your death living out a fantasy - a Lucid Dream. What they completely fail to explain is how exactly a dead person, a corpse with a dead brain, which is being deep frozen in order to cease all activity and the changes wrought by time to enable revival centuries hence; how such a dead body, then, is supposed to *experience* the said Lucid Dream. Such an ability represents a victory against death even better than physical revival would be. You wouldn't even wait to die in order to experience a perfect life from whatever moment you wish, you'd pay large amounts of money to experience such a thing without dying. So why bother with the antiquated idea of cryogenic freezing of the corpse after death (necessitating Aames to have undertaken a suicide that was impossible to believe in, knowing the character) when he could simply have decided to get frozen and live a better life?Tom Cruise is very good as the man who sees a different kind of life possible through the sight and brief encounter with Sophia, and later excellent as a man dealing with the solitary life of a disfigured man. However, Penélope Cruz is considerably less adept at displaying exactly what it is supposed to be that Cruise is falling in love with, although this is really down to her part being underwritten.To the user whose comment asked for a response to his theory that the whole thing was an examination of David Aames fear and rejection of his own love for Julie (Cameron Diaz's character), I'm afraid that user has been blinded by the fact that the woman is played by Cameron Diaz. There is absolutely nothing in the film or in her performance to suggest that she is anything but the villainess of the piece, the ultimately suicidal, violently obsessive stalker that she is intended to be. Diaz plays the part very well and courageously, and any attempt to see her character as being any better than she is supposed to be is basically a detrimental opinion of her performance.

What`s new in this film, is that the old Pakistani`s sons don`t want to marry the proposed brides not because they love other girls.

Billy lives a lazy live of goofing around and being drunk by the pool before midday.  When his father decides to hand the business over to associate Eric Gordon because Billy is too dumb to do it - having only passed his school exams by his father paying his teachers.  Billy doesn't want to be cut out so agrees to go through school all over again - doing one grade every two weeks.Adam Sadler films are very much a matter of taste - if you like him doing his usual `dumb guy who makes good' stuff then you'll be right at home with his early films.  I am in two minds about it, his humour is generally very lowbrow but he does have a few funny moments in any film.  That is the case here, overall the humour is very childish but it does have an occasional moment that is just so off the wall and out of the blue that they are hilarious.  Examples include the blue duck, an invisible penguin, the fight between shampoo & conditioner, the principal who's wife is a slut and a hilarious response to Billy where `wrong' would have sufficed!Do these few funny moments save the film? No, they make it bearable, else I would have been angry with no laughs - but one every ten minutes make it OK, if not really worth watching.  The plot is stupid and the characters are rubbish.  I know that these things are not what the film is about, but one has to wonder how stupid the writers think the audience are when they simply switch Veronica from hating Billy to being totally in love with him with no explanation or reason!  Of course this is a minor problem - the bigger problem is the fact that the film isn't consistently funny enough to work.Sadler is his usual self - if you like that you'll like that if not you won't.  He has a few good moments but generally his performance is childish and not funny.  He has an imagination on him for the weird that happily creates the funny moments but his performance is painful.  Worse still is Wilson; she cannot act in anything I've seen and here she must carry some blame for being totally unable to phase her growing affection for Billy - instead it's like she just flicked a switch.  The support cast is OK although it's sad to see Whitford slumming it when he is better than this.Overall this film has enough laugh-out-loud moments that appealed to my sense of humour and made me semi-glad I watched it.  However it is a major problem that the film has no plot, characters, logic or consistent laughs. A weak film, albeit a weak film that has a handful of hilarious moments and the odd very imaginative touch!

I am in two minds about it, his humour is generally very lowbrow but he does have a few funny moments in any film.  That is the case here, overall the humour is very childish but it does have an occasional moment that is just so off the wall and out of the blue that they are hilarious.  Examples include the blue duck, an invisible penguin, the fight between shampoo & conditioner, the principal who's wife is a slut and a hilarious response to Billy where `wrong' would have sufficed!Do these few funny moments save the film? No, they make it bearable, else I would have been angry with no laughs - but one every ten minutes make it OK, if not really worth watching.  The plot is stupid and the characters are rubbish.  I know that these things are not what the film is about, but one has to wonder how stupid the writers think the audience are when they simply switch Veronica from hating Billy to being totally in love with him with no explanation or reason!  Of course this is a minor problem - the bigger problem is the fact that the film isn't consistently funny enough to work.Sadler is his usual self - if you like that you'll like that if not you won't.  He has a few good moments but generally his performance is childish and not funny.  He has an imagination on him for the weird that happily creates the funny moments but his performance is painful.  Worse still is Wilson; she cannot act in anything I've seen and here she must carry some blame for being totally unable to phase her growing affection for Billy - instead it's like she just flicked a switch.  The support cast is OK although it's sad to see Whitford slumming it when he is better than this.Overall this film has enough laugh-out-loud moments that appealed to my sense of humour and made me semi-glad I watched it.  However it is a major problem that the film has no plot, characters, logic or consistent laughs. A weak film, albeit a weak film that has a handful of hilarious moments and the odd very imaginative touch!

There's nothing better than a roomful of inebriated people (mostly girls) jumping and screaming on cue to make a horror movie more enjoyable.  I watched it again after I'd sobered up and was only slightly less impressed.The hero and heroine are likable, if not entirely believable.  They do some really stupid things and share some occasionally dimwitted dialogue, but at least they're brother and sister, sparing the teen-weary audience the obligatory makeout scenes.  The Creeper is impressive as well, although we never find out exactly what the hell he is.  He rather resembles a gargoyle and is able to fly with some rather stunning looking wings...but seems to prefer dressing up like a human and driving a big ol' yee-ha truck with a personalized license plate (BEATINGU) through the cornfields of the Midwest. Go figure. (How he stood in line at the DMV undetected to get that done, I'll never know.)The old abandoned crow-infested church where our villain likes to hang out is a nice set piece - moody, gloomy, drippy-wet and stinky, the walls and ceiling studded with the varnished remains of previous victims who have been ripped apart and methodically sewn back together again.  Why on earth anyone would want to investigate this place is beyond me, but that's exactly what our brother-and-sister do just minutes after being terrorized on the road by our title monster.  Yeah, right.  Okay, so some of the plot devices don't really work all that well...including an incredibly annoying psychic woman who likes to sing the old Jeepers Creepers song in an off-key, quavering voice that will have your nerve endings screaming for mercy.  But the shot of the Creeper near the end, as his wings unfold and his face blossoms open, is so incredibly impressive that it almost makes up for all of the films little flaws.  The horrific ending is also a shocker, an unexpectedly brutal climax to a film that had been played mostly for laughs up until that point.This film isn't all that bad.  It could have been a lot better if it had not swerved over the horror\/comedy line so many times and just picked which side it really wanted to be on once and for all.  Perhaps this is why I preferred the sequel.

There are only glancing similarities. Most every reviewer has pointed this out and now so have I. But that makes it far from disappointing. It starts right into the action and tosses a mystery in your face. Before you get a chance to ponder too long the fit hits the shan. I love this movie. It is so nightmarish, grotesque, and at times hideous. The special effects are stomach churning every time - and fascinating - almost beautiful. And yet it isn't necessarily a 'gross-out'. There's plenty of blood and ooze to last a couple of sequels - it's just the nature of this beast - whatever it is. The movie keeps you tensed and eventually resolves to a logical ending. Then I wonder why a sequel was never made? Now I understand this didn't exactly pack them in at the box-office. It's just as well. It would have been hard to equal this in a sequel.The acting is exact and convincing. Russell is, well, as you've seen him before and since. But he does it well. No-one really stands out, but everyone is competent and the character development works so well you don't even notice it happening. The background music is taut. Perfect.The real show stopper is the special effects. For maximum effect - beware. Many cable channels will show this movie but they always cut it. When they do this they take away some of the more interesting effects. Yes, they are intense and disturbing - but that is the whole point - innit? That is why this one is a 'keeper' in my library. Great Halloween night flick! Just maybe not for the feeble or green, if you know what I mean?I have viewed this multiple times and still find it worthy.

Though to be honest, my expectations of this film were not very high. My only hope was that the movie would at least respect the comics' origins, continuity, and personalities of Peter and the rest of the characters. I was both impressed and pleasently surprised by how well this was done.The plot is exciting and dramatic, and doesn't get boring even if you know the story inside and out. Tobey Maguire does an excellent Peter Parker, nailing the role perfectly; from the sharp intellect to the cheesy jokes. I was equally impressed with almost all the other actors. The special effects were beautifully done, and truly succeeded in adding excitement to an already superbly crafted, suspenseful script.This movie stays true enough to the comics to satisfy even the most devoted fan, while at the same time delivering action, adventure, drama, suspense, and romance, making Spider-Man an enjoyable experience for all. My only complaints; the mediocre actor who played J. Jonah Jameson failed to portray the character convincingly. I was dissapointed with their interpretation of the character, and even more dissapointed with the flawed, overexaggerated acting used to convey the character.I also felt that not only was it unneccesary to go against the comics by having Peter's webs naturally produced by him, but that it was detrimental to the character of Peter Parker; as him creating the web-shooters on his own showcased his intelligence and creativity, qualities that the movie could've shown in greater light. I thought the Green Goblin could've been made to look a lot more authentic, I wasn't very impressed with the new, sleek, cheesy metallic-looking Goblin. Also, while the actor who played Norman Osbourne did a great job of acting, once again I think the character could've been captured better.Though all in all, Spider-Man makes for a great movie.

The special effects were beautifully done, and truly succeeded in adding excitement to an already superbly crafted, suspenseful script.This movie stays true enough to the comics to satisfy even the most devoted fan, while at the same time delivering action, adventure, drama, suspense, and romance, making Spider-Man an enjoyable experience for all. My only complaints; the mediocre actor who played J. Jonah Jameson failed to portray the character convincingly. I was dissapointed with their interpretation of the character, and even more dissapointed with the flawed, overexaggerated acting used to convey the character.I also felt that not only was it unneccesary to go against the comics by having Peter's webs naturally produced by him, but that it was detrimental to the character of Peter Parker; as him creating the web-shooters on his own showcased his intelligence and creativity, qualities that the movie could've shown in greater light. I thought the Green Goblin could've been made to look a lot more authentic, I wasn't very impressed with the new, sleek, cheesy metallic-looking Goblin. Also, while the actor who played Norman Osbourne did a great job of acting, once again I think the character could've been captured better.Though all in all, Spider-Man makes for a great movie. Far better than most of the garbage being put out nowadays. It's certainly refreshing to see a movie which succeeds in using modern film technology and special effects to tell a superb story. For the most part, excellent acting and screenplay. Though my only dissapointment is this movie could've easily been so much better than it already is, if only a few minor details in the screenplay and choice of actors were altered.

Unfortunately, thanks to Jackson, that will not be possible for a long time.Watching this movie left me with the impression that with any sort of budget at all, then this story simply couldn't be stuffed up. Fantasy just provides so many opportunities for making an interesting film. There were many moments in this film that were potentially more interesting than the way that Peter Jackson did it, although of course you always have to use your imagination due to the poor execution. The way they tried to show the wraith world from Frodo's point of view for example. Or the way that Galadriel showed Sam what was happening back home for another.Another thing I really appreciated in this version - the silent moments. There were moments when dialog was spoken with no background music against a still back-drop. Compare that to the grandiose swooping camera of the Jackson films, and the intrusive score which seemed designed to stress how each and every scene was the most poignant and powerful scene we had ever watched. Jackson's films were full of their own importance, this was quieter and a lot more modest.Jackson and co hit this with more than US$270 million dollars in production costs, at least $90 million dollars more for marketing, a massive tax break from the NZ government, and also gained massive savings from filming in NZ not the USA.

Of course a lot of things were wrong, the acting was awful and pretty much sunk everything, and the pace was too fast. Naturally they cut a lot, and adapted other scenes, and for this they deserve credit.

There's actually a curious similarity between the structure of the Jackson and Bakshi films near the beginning - in that they both deviate from the original books in the same way - although of course some of this could be coincidence.This was not a good film, but the potential was there.

Knowing my extreme interest in mafia-related movies, this film was recommended to me by many sources. I really had no idea what to expect. Unlike the Godfather Trilogy, which show you the intricate interworkings of the mafia, this movie is really an introductory to mafia life ---- Mafia 101, if you'd like. It's seen though the eyes of a young Italian boy named Calogero. Not to repeat what's been said in every other review, but Calogero lives in Little Italy, New York. His neighborhood is a hangout for the mafia, headed by a man named Sonny.   One day, Calogero witnesses a shooting by Sonny, but refuses to turn him into the police. I particularly liked the scene where the boy was brought to look at a lineup of hoodlums, to pick out who the shooter was. When he came to Sonny there was a long gaze between Calogero and the mafia king. But the boy didn't turn him in. After that, Sonny befriended the boy --- and became a second father. Through the years, there was a battle between Sonny & Calagero's real father (played amazingly by Robert DeNiro). Of course the father didn't want Calogero hanging out with those types of people. A side story involved the battle between black & white neighborhoods ---  and Calogero falling in love with a black girl from the wrong side of the tracks. Personally, I thought this girl (Jean) could've been more likeable. She didn't seem like anyone you would risk your life to walk home.This movie has a surprising & sad ending --- which I won't tell you in case you haven't seen it. All things considered, this was one of the best movies I've seen. Definitely one that I could watch over & over again. And a definite must for my video collection.

He is approached by Capt Korso, telling him that he holds the map to where his father hid the powerful Titan craft. However the Drej want it every bit as much as humanity.I came to this film by mixing it up with that other multiplex sci-fi animation that was fully computer generated. I forget it's title but I realised quite quickly that this film wasn't it!  However, the opening 5 minutes are so gripping that I was hooked, however it couldn't keep it up and the tone was too uneven to be successful.  On one hand you have a basic sci-fi plot that looks great, has style and moves well.  The action is surprisingly bloody at times but at other times it chickens out of killing characters - preferring Looney Toons type reaction to explosions.The biggest area where it shows it's second speed is it's characters. They have character traits that are interesting and not everyone is as they seem, but they have all been through the Disney style machine and been made cuter and funnier than they should have been.  This is a major down side as the material and delivery required darker characters. Sure it would have made it less of a kids movie but it would have been better.  As it is, it is still an enjoyable sci-fi despite this kid-friendly shine to it.The voice cast are good on paper but not all as good in reality.  Damon is a solid All-American lead and does well, while Pullman adds much needed weight to his role.  Barrymore doesn't sound like her hearts' in it and Garofalo's voice simply doesn't suit her character or her dialogue.  Likewise both Lane and Leguizamo contribute to the Disney effect by playing it too humorous at times - they do OK but don't fit what I was looking for.Overall this is an OK sci-fi despite the weaknesses.  If I had the choice I would watch something else but, for what it is, it is pretty enjoyable but should have stuck with the darker tone that at times it has to good effect.
