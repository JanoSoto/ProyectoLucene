Even the slightly censored version (which is the only one around it seems) delivers the strong content.The final 3rd is especially hard hitting, the killers motive (at last) expertly handled with no psychobabble motivations on display.Nic Cage does a good job while Phoenix, Gandolfini and Stormare steal the show.
