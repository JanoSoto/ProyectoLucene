M. Night Shyamalan took his time writing and directing this tremendous work of film. I find it cornball when people proclaim movies as art that are all about themes and expressionism, but I'm starting to understand that feeling after my most recent Sixth Sense view. Every time I watch the movie there seems to be something new I pick up that I didn't previously notice. The story is so solid, there isn't one crack in it. To go along with such a fresh screenplay was an amazing cast that headlined Bruce Willis, which I don't think it's crazy to say that this is his best work. The Sixth Sense is more of a drama than a horror film but when the ghost scenes occurred they were terrifying and unforgiving to the viewer. On a lighter note too, it was nice to see the family dog make it through a scary flick for once. Definitely check out The Sixth Sense (9\/10) because it is still worthy of a watch even if you know the twist.

And one of them brought his dame with him.For the purposes of the film, that would be Edward G. Robinson's Johnny Rocco character, a semi-retired mobster who moves into a hotel in Key Largo off-season to make a big score, taking with him a few of his boys and an old flame, Gaye Dawn (Claire Trevor).Humphrey Bogart's Frank McCloud is a former Army major who fought in Italy, and comes to pay his respects to the father (Lionel Barrymore) and widow (Lauren Bacall) of a fallen comrade, who run the same hotel. He's not a gangster this time, but he's still a tough guy, as Rocco and his bulls find out when they try and take McCloud for a ride.Key Largo is a brilliantly acted, moody and suspenseful film worthy of the talents of all concerned, including director\/co- screenwriter John Huston. It's got a distinct Hemingway vibe about it, kind of Soldier's Home meets The Killers with McCloud a sort of Nick Adams figure. He hardly says very much, but he makes you pay attention when he does speak. (Bogart and Bacall earlier made a movie based on a Hemingway novel that didn't seem much like Papa at all!)Trevor won the film's lone Oscar, and deserved it, but Robinson steals the picture. As mark.waltz points out in his July 2012 review here, the name seems a callback to the crime-boss character Rico that Robinson played in Little Caesar, and he's still the same trigger-happy dumbbell here that he was then. He exudes menace and cruelty, and also a sense of bewildered helplessness at his present condition that's rather affectingAfter living in the USA for more than 30 years, they called me an undesirable alien.

He chews a mean wad of gum and has a hilarious monologue while trying to distract an angry Rocco about people bringing back Prohibition so the gangsters can have the old days back.What I don't like so much about the film is the odd subtext, which plays up McCloud's current disillusionment on account of Rocco being present. Did he really think World War II was the war to end gangsterism?There's also a subplot about some local Seminoles who huddle around the hotel when the hurricane strikes. You kind of need them late in the film for the tragedy that triggers McCloud's late burst of action, but it doesn't make any sense on its own. It feels tacked on and a bit stagey, like much else in this film.And what's with the anger directed at McCloud for not plugging Rocco? Did that scene ever make sense as a display of apparent cowardice on McCloud's part? What was he supposed to do?Max Steiner's overbearing score is another letdown. I didn't even think much of the final confrontation between McCloud and Rocco's gang. It's a bit too easy and low-key.But what's good about Key Largo outweighs what's not. Bacall does fine work playing a part rather than burnishing her star power, and Bogart shows how to let another screen legend (Robinson) rant on and on without losing his own magnetism.

On a global scale, it was the first video game-film adaptation to turn a buck, which should count for something despite the routine bashing it receives for how shoddily it portrayed the most popular fighting game of the time on the big screen. I was personally never a huge STREET FIGHTER fan, but while I can certainly spot the plot line unfaithfulness, I can't help but notice just how fun the movie is. It's a poor adaptation and a questionable action movie, but nevertheless a decent teenaged adventure when taken at face value.The story When the mad warlord General M. Bison (Raul Julia) is poised to overrun the earth in pursuit of his own personal empire, it will be up to a multi-faceted group of fighters - including Colonel William Guile (Van Damme), reporter Chun-Li (Ming Na), and conmen Ryu Hoshi (Byron Mann) and Ken Masters (Damian Chapa) - to stop him.This film is definitely over-cast, comparable to MORTAL KOMBAT ANNIHILATION in terms of saturation. No less than fifteen characters from the original two games - more than half of their combined casts - are featured, resulting in a stifling deficit of character development, since next to none of them have the appropriate amount of screen time for it. The actual casting choices of these characters can also be taken to task, but I'm pleased that - through the admirably accurate costumes and cosmetics - most of the performers at least *look* like their animated counterparts (in some cases, like Robert Blanka Mammone, you almost wish they didn't). Personalities and backgrounds have been addled with as expected to accommodate the tournament-free premise, but none of them bother me as much as the case of M. Bison he's the single goofiest part of this whole immature adventure, practically a forerunner to Dr. Evil, having been written so comically that it's impossible to consider him threatening even when he's snapping guys' necks or shooting electricity from his fists.The movie never has a problem with pacing, rolling along fittingly enough at a video game's pace and always presenting you with some silly or bombastic event to watch; it's never boring. Sadly, there's not nearly enough fighting going on, and when it does happen it's not that great. It seems amazing that, considering what it's based on, the movie only has a 'round half-dozen fights, depending on your definition of a fight (i.e. I don't consider it a fight when Guile and his team ambush some soldiers and Kylie Minogue does a cool but unnecessary pro wrestling move), and even more amazing how very bland most of them are with Benny Urquidez supplying fight choreography. Some of the performers just aren't good, and some of them surprisingly so (is this the same Damian Chapa who rocked the house with Michael Worth in U.S. SEALS 2? I hope not!), but other times they just feel stifled. For example, the showdown between Ryu and Vega (Jay Tavare) was my favorite of the movie, and really felt like it could've gone somewhere were it not for the cramped locker room they were in.Apparently, the critical lashing STREET FIGHTER received moved Van Damme to choose his future roles more carefully, so in a pinch, I'll accredit every good movie he did subsequently to this minor disappointment. Seeing as this particular franchise hasn't done too well in live-action film regardless of who's involved, I can't be too hard on this first attempt and will continue to regard it neutrally and enjoy it by accident every few years.

No less than fifteen characters from the original two games - more than half of their combined casts - are featured, resulting in a stifling deficit of character development, since next to none of them have the appropriate amount of screen time for it. The actual casting choices of these characters can also be taken to task, but I'm pleased that - through the admirably accurate costumes and cosmetics - most of the performers at least *look* like their animated counterparts (in some cases, like Robert Blanka Mammone, you almost wish they didn't). Personalities and backgrounds have been addled with as expected to accommodate the tournament-free premise, but none of them bother me as much as the case of M. Bison he's the single goofiest part of this whole immature adventure, practically a forerunner to Dr. Evil, having been written so comically that it's impossible to consider him threatening even when he's snapping guys' necks or shooting electricity from his fists.The movie never has a problem with pacing, rolling along fittingly enough at a video game's pace and always presenting you with some silly or bombastic event to watch; it's never boring. Sadly, there's not nearly enough fighting going on, and when it does happen it's not that great. It seems amazing that, considering what it's based on, the movie only has a 'round half-dozen fights, depending on your definition of a fight (i.e. I don't consider it a fight when Guile and his team ambush some soldiers and Kylie Minogue does a cool but unnecessary pro wrestling move), and even more amazing how very bland most of them are with Benny Urquidez supplying fight choreography. Some of the performers just aren't good, and some of them surprisingly so (is this the same Damian Chapa who rocked the house with Michael Worth in U.S. SEALS 2? I hope not!), but other times they just feel stifled. For example, the showdown between Ryu and Vega (Jay Tavare) was my favorite of the movie, and really felt like it could've gone somewhere were it not for the cramped locker room they were in.Apparently, the critical lashing STREET FIGHTER received moved Van Damme to choose his future roles more carefully, so in a pinch, I'll accredit every good movie he did subsequently to this minor disappointment. Seeing as this particular franchise hasn't done too well in live-action film regardless of who's involved, I can't be too hard on this first attempt and will continue to regard it neutrally and enjoy it by accident every few years. Fans of the games who somehow have yet to see the film should avoid it unless they're intentionally looking for something to heckle.

In fact, it has been sometime since I last watched this, but having stumbled upon it again here, I feel it's my duty to give it the review it deserves. Bully is quite simply, one of the best movies ever made. A sweeping statement I know, but having watched thousands of a similar vein, I can't ever tire of the dangerously hypnotic truth that sets these characters apart from so many. Each living the American Dream, or so they believe, yet their actual lives are thick with angst and desperately torn by insecurities that they fulfil with drugs and sex. Clarke's ability to depict them as the true, purified white trash they are, is a depressing portrait of the teens that fight against the seemingly dull reality of life. We meet Marty & Bobby, friends at heart, yet closer to the shore are signs of detrimental physical and mental abuse. Bobby's battles are somewhat deeper than Marty's, but both live uncertain lives. Bobby's issues are with his father, his sexuality and the claustrophobia that new friends can bring when Marty is no longer his 'best pal'. Then in comes Lisa, Marty's one and only true love &#x96; a fresh faced young, but naive girl who only wants the best for her blooming boyfriend. Add punk Heather and fun-loving Ali and the recipe is starkly brilliant for the melting pot they are about to enter. Various encounters Bobby has with both Marty and Heather lead to the rest of the group deciding Bobby's fate. As I'm sure most of you will be able to piece together the puzzle, I won't spell out for you the rest as it really is something you need to experience yourself.The thing about this film is that, such a simple premise, can make for such impending questions about society and life. What we believe to see, as harmless and pathetic teenagers trying to get by, turns into a sincere questions about the realms of life, friendship and morality. Clarke digs deep underneath the spectrum to upturn the lives of these symbolically 'innocent' teens, to show the audience the very fact these individuals thought they would get away with such a crime, yet this is something we are able to believe &#x96; these kids aren't a product of society but society is a product of them. An example pans to the end of the film when Ali asks her mother directly whether or not if one of her friends was part of a murder or crime, how important would it be to report it? This is a great depiction of how naive these kids are and the belief that anything they did or carried out was completely above suspicion. What we're left with is a sour taste in our mouth, unable to truly process the events carried out in the second half. Clarke doesn't miss out any detail - certain scenes are fuelled with sex, violence and drugs, but this is done with dramatic effect and for the audience to delve into the lives of these delinquents, to try and understand their lives and backgrounds. What also always got me was the true form of Marty's and Lisa's love, initially it's quite hard to believe the authenticity of their passion, but as the film evolves, their relationship becomes so boldly intense. Soon we realise that Lisa's love for Marty doesn't hold back on any episode, the fight to the bitter end sends her in a dismay of love, hate and anger that sets to blow her final fuse of guilt as she confesses everything to her friend. The ending is something that to me, always stands out, and brings an array of emotions to front which when you have gone on the journey with these characters, can't help but feel confused, bitter and angry. With the fear of over-telling, I can't promote this film enough, if you like to explore the darker sides to humanity that haven't necessarily been explored then this is something you should experience. You'll never regret it. ","genre":null},{"date":"10 May 2015","score":"","review":" A film that will continuously be in your thoughts for years after viewing it.

Enraged, he husband grabs a gun and kills the man she accused of the crime. When arrested, Frederick Manion (Ben Gazzara) claims that he didn't remember any of it, but nobody really believes his story. His wife turns to a relatively unknown country lawyer for help, and after meeting with the Manion's, Paul Biegler (Jimmy Stewart) agrees to take the case. It's never clear whether or not even he believes his client's story, but either way, Biegler is determined to get the man exonerated. Many law professors consider this film to be the most accurate depiction of a trial ever fictionalized on film. Likewise, the Academy was also very impressed, giving Anatomy of A Murder seven Oscar nominations, but does the film really stand the test of time? For 1959, the Manion's were as promiscuous and dysfunctional a couple as could be on film, however in 2015, they are rather tame. That's not the only thing that gets lost in time, as the laws surrounding the insanity defense have also changed, making the whole premise around this trial more than somewhat outdated. This film simply doesn't have the impact in 2015, that it did in 1959, but that doesn't mean it's not entertaining. Jimmy Stewart stars as Defense Attorney, Paul Biegler, who unfortunately isn't the most interesting man in the world. He's a very bland character, without much depth, but he is an intelligent lawyer, who finds every trick and loophole in the book to defend his client. Jimmy Stewart was a tall lanky man with a strange voice, who I thought was a natural when it came to physical comedy, but Stewart preferred to play a more intelligent character, especially later in his career, and Paul Biegler is a textbook example of that. Anatomy of A Murder is on almost every top 100 list you can find, and in it's time it absolutely belonged there, but by 2015 standards, it's very long, tame, and outdated, despite the excellent story and depiction of a courtroom.

That's not the only thing that gets lost in time, as the laws surrounding the insanity defense have also changed, making the whole premise around this trial more than somewhat outdated. This film simply doesn't have the impact in 2015, that it did in 1959, but that doesn't mean it's not entertaining. Jimmy Stewart stars as Defense Attorney, Paul Biegler, who unfortunately isn't the most interesting man in the world. He's a very bland character, without much depth, but he is an intelligent lawyer, who finds every trick and loophole in the book to defend his client. Jimmy Stewart was a tall lanky man with a strange voice, who I thought was a natural when it came to physical comedy, but Stewart preferred to play a more intelligent character, especially later in his career, and Paul Biegler is a textbook example of that. Anatomy of A Murder is on almost every top 100 list you can find, and in it's time it absolutely belonged there, but by 2015 standards, it's very long, tame, and outdated, despite the excellent story and depiction of a courtroom.

Well, what could I expect? The makers of The Exorcist certainly weren't aiming for plausibility here. No. Their goal was to gross the audience out like it had never been grossed out before and make a huge pile of money doing it. I'm sure we'd all agree that they succeeded very well on both counts.As far as Reagan's possession goes, I think it was a really screwy one and kinda wimpy, too.To begin with, since she seemed to be fortified with an incredible amount of physical power, this left me wondering why the hell she would allow herself to be confined, like a prisoner, to her own bedroom. I would think that whatever it was that was possessing her would be itching to go out on the town and, you know, turn a few heads around on Main Street, or something wickedly-fun like that. But none of this kinda thing happened. There were no aborted escape attempts, either.All-in-all, it was a kind of stupid demon. Boring and unadventurous, if you ask me. But apparently Reagan did get out once (or did she?) to desecrate the virgin Mary icon in the church. And her desecration was so artistically done, too. It was an amazing piece of art work for a mere 12 year old whose previous examples of clay figures were lumpy turtles and the likes.

As much cliché as it sounds, i didn't blink once throughout the movie as this movie will be a through entertainer and a sad remainder of the past. As both the director and the writer for this masterpiece, he has successfully and accurately depicted the horrors of the Vietnam War taken out straight from his memory lanes when he volunteered to joined to fight for his country. Charlie Sheen is amazing with his voice narration and genuine facial expressions. Williem Dafoe is surprisingly the good guy here and he is amazing too. But most importantly Tom Berenger gave the performance of a lifetime as an insane but ruthless leader and a true fighter. The score has served it's purpose of providing dark, serious atmosphere and combined with the voice narration of Sheen who has dialogs that hit right in the feels , this movie is a must. It's not just the acting and the dialogs that are moving but the story itself is touching. With characters struggling to cope up with this new found freedom, they inch closer and closer to insanity each passing day. The war has turned some into maniacs as it titillates their darker propensities of those, exposing their inner demons which, in turn, gave birth to animistic behavior like raping children , killing innocents as a 'revenge' and burning down villages . And they enjoyed doing it. Not a feeling of guilt, not a single regret.The question that haunts me is after the war, those lunatics who survived , what did they do with their lives? How did they adjust back to the society? Well, what i think is that most of them ended up in the streets as those homeless , drunk , vets that are found so much in abundance in the States. States.
