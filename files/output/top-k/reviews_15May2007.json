[{"date":"15 May 2007","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Shrek is an excellent movie that I have never heard a bad thing about. It is such a funny movie that is very easy to understand and get into. Shrek is a very cute family movie and is very funny. This movie is full of different fairy tales which is a great idea. All of the characters are easy to love and laugh with. They are all such life-like characters but at the same time cartoons. This is a great movie for all different ages. Mike Myers is the perfect actor to play Shrek's roll. He is a very funny man and can make anyone laugh. Everyone is amused by Donkey, played by Eddie Murphy. There is a lot of comedy in this movie, which is why it is a different type of cartoon. Princess Fiona, played by Cameron Diaz, is a perfect fit. She is a energized and outgoing princess who has attitude, but the right kind of attitude for this movie. Shrek is a character who is wanting to be alone at the beginning of the movie when all of the fairy tale characters come to his swamp to avoid the evil Lord Farquaad. As the movie carries on, he becomes more sensible and nicer to everyone. Overall, Shrek is a great movie for all ages. There's no way anyone can go wrong with Shrek!
