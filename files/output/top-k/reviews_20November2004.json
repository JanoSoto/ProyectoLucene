I hoped that I was wrong the first time, when I saw this disaster in the theatre. I wasn't.This movie is a combination of a bad script and worse acting. The worst thing about this movie is that it cannot be unmade. It will forever diminish thegreatness of the original three episodes. After a somewhat indifferent reaction from me toward episode 1 and a backlash from a mass of star wars fans abouthow bad it was, I thought for sure Lucas would get it right.Wrong.Even the special effects, which are amazing throughout most of the movie, take over the story. George Lucas would have done well to take a Peter Jackson- type approach by not letting the visual effects overwhelm the story. They did. And, there is something inhuman and cold about the effects. I was reminded of it while watching the trailer for the third episode. The armies of troops look very digital. There is no warmth or humanity in them like you see in the first three movies where you had to have guys in actual suits to play the parts.Hayden Christenshianndn........ (not even worth remembering) is anabomination to this series. Natalie Portman, shame on you! You're supposed to be theatre trained... I am not looking forward to seeing the third movie. I'm struggling because I almost feel obligated to finish out the series. But, I don't know if any of these people deserve my money at the box office.And, while the Yoda fight is kinda dope, seeing it again makes it seems SOcartoon. So cheesy. They should have made it a lot more gritty and real andhard-nosed than try to make a killer battle scene between the most powerfuljedis. After the glitz of seeing it the first time wore off, I have nothing left but to see it for what it truly is. Also, this crew tried way too hard to fit the story of Darth Vader's rise into three movies. It is too great a time to fit such depth. It shows. The first two movies had to rush to tell stories, and worse than that? The makers didn't even tell a good story or enough story in the six hours or whatever time. Instead, they tried to hide the disgrace they made with lots of digital effects that don't compliment the story and with idiotic, contrived, forced humor and interaction.Shame on the actors too for not doing more with such junk writing.

He can get you whatever you need cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods. But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for murder. He's apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details involving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality; all that counts inside prison is its own society - who is strong, who is not - and the measured passage of time. Red is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes up in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been rehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out of his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that he has been institutionalized - that, like another old lifer who kills himself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on the outside. Red's narration of the story allows him to speak for all of the prisoners, who sense a fortitude and integrity in Andy that survives the years. Andy will not kiss butt. He will not back down. But he is not violent, just formidably sure of himself. For the warden (Bob Gunton), he is both a challenge and a resource; Andy knows all about bookkeeping and tax preparation, and before long he's been moved out of his prison job in the library and assigned to the warden's office, where he sits behind an adding machine and keeps tabs on the warden's ill-gotten gains. His fame spreads, and eventually he's doing the taxes and pension plans for most of the officials of the local prison system. There are key moments in the film, as when Andy uses his clout to get some cold beers for his friends who are working on a roofing job. Or when he befriends the old prison librarian (James Whitmore). Or when he oversteps his boundaries and is thrown into solitary confinement. What quietly amazes everyone in the prison - and us, too - is the way he accepts the good and the bad as all part of some larger pattern than only he can fully see.The partnership between the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is crucial to the way the story unfolds. This is not a prison drama in any conventional sense of the word. It is not about violence, riots or melodrama. The word redemption is in the title for a reason. The movie is based on a story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King, which is quite unlike most of King's work. The horror here is not of the supernatural kind, but of the sort that flows from the realization than 10, 20, 30 years of a man's life have unreeled in the same unchanging daily prison routine. The director, Frank Darabont, paints the prison in drab grays and shadows, so that when key events do occur, they seem to have a life of their own. Andy, as played by Robbins, keeps his thoughts to himself. Red, as Freeman plays him, is therefore a crucial element in the story His close observation of this man, down through the years, provides the way we monitor changes and track the measure of his influence on those around him. And all the time there is something else happening, hidden and secret, which is revealed only at the end. The Shawshank Redemption is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption.All in all, I think it is a very good film and worthy for everybody to watch, the most important sentences ¡°Hope is a good thing , maybe the best of things, No good thing ever dies.¡± It is really make us thinking deeply, and another one which was said by Red, he said that there has one kind of birds that you could never keep him in the cage, because every feather of his body was covered by the brilliance of freedom. I think everyone should remember this , everyone of us are covered by some brilliance of our own, we should never give up no matter how difficult it is! And we should remember that ¡°hope is a good thing¡± ,we should have hopes for all our lives!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ","genre":null},{"date":"20 November 2004","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" When i first watched it i like it at once,it is really a good film.i can learn a lot of things from it.¡°The Shawshank Redemption, which is a movie about time, patience and loyalty - not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair.The story is narrated by Red Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur.

He can get you whatever you need cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods. But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for murder. He's apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details involving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality; all that counts inside prison is its own society - who is strong, who is not - and the measured passage of time. Red is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes up in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been rehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out of his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that he has been institutionalized - that, like another old lifer who kills himself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on the outside. Red's narration of the story allows him to speak for all of the prisoners, who sense a fortitude and integrity in Andy that survives the years. Andy will not kiss butt. He will not back down. But he is not violent, just formidably sure of himself. For the warden (Bob Gunton), he is both a challenge and a resource; Andy knows all about bookkeeping and tax preparation, and before long he's been moved out of his prison job in the library and assigned to the warden's office, where he sits behind an adding machine and keeps tabs on the warden's ill-gotten gains. His fame spreads, and eventually he's doing the taxes and pension plans for most of the officials of the local prison system. There are key moments in the film, as when Andy uses his clout to get some cold beers for his friends who are working on a roofing job. Or when he befriends the old prison librarian (James Whitmore). Or when he oversteps his boundaries and is thrown into solitary confinement. What quietly amazes everyone in the prison - and us, too - is the way he accepts the good and the bad as all part of some larger pattern than only he can fully see.The partnership between the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is crucial to the way the story unfolds. This is not a prison drama in any conventional sense of the word. It is not about violence, riots or melodrama. The word redemption is in the title for a reason. The movie is based on a story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King, which is quite unlike most of King's work. The horror here is not of the supernatural kind, but of the sort that flows from the realization than 10, 20, 30 years of a man's life have unreeled in the same unchanging daily prison routine. The director, Frank Darabont, paints the prison in drab grays and shadows, so that when key events do occur, they seem to have a life of their own. Andy, as played by Robbins, keeps his thoughts to himself. Red, as Freeman plays him, is therefore a crucial element in the story His close observation of this man, down through the years, provides the way we monitor changes and track the measure of his influence on those around him. And all the time there is something else happening, hidden and secret, which is revealed only at the end.

The exception, the one thing that was a little funny, every once in a great while, was Levi Stubbs, the voice of the extra-terrestrial evil plant(yes, you read that right). He did a pretty good job, and was occasionally funny. The special effects were somewhat good, for a late 80's film. I don't know if my strong dislike for this film came from the fact that I mostly loathe musicals, that I found the humor to mostly consist of the same in-your-face not-in-the-least-bit-subtle humor that you see in most crappy TV shows and comedies today, or simply from the fact that I had expected it to be the Roger Corman horror-comedy of the same name, which I have wanted to see for some time(same as just about all of the other Corman-directed films, after seeing, and really liking, The Terror and Frankenstein Unbound) since the ads that promoted the showing of this movie all talked about the Corman version, or some fourth reason... but I did. I disliked it. A lot. The plot is dull and poorly paced. The musical numbers are awful. The characters are clichés and stereotypes, and poorly written ones at that. The acting is laughable.

Can you imagine how good this could have been if these great comedians had gotten to do what they do best? Steve Martin, Rick Moranis, Bill Murray... even James Belushi, though he's always lived in his brother shadow. The film is just a mess of an 80's musical with bad music.

It makes its point and pulls no punches doing so, illustrating the impersonal coldness of war and the desolation in rendering an 'enemy' of someone who you'd really have no issues with on an individual basis. This message is particularly well-captured in one especially harrowing scene - I won't divulge in the details, for the sake of those still yet to witness this masterpiece, but needless to say, it's a real tear-jerker. The war depicted here is not one of glory and heroism, but one of hardship, horror and desperation.(Also, isn't it kinda eerie how those dramatic battle sequences, in which the opposing soldiers become little more than human targets, now, with retrospect, echo the vicious gameplay of a shoot-em-up video game?)The only really noticeable problem with this film comes in the heavy use of US accents, which clash somewhat with the German setting and therefore sound just a little offbeat. Nonetheless, the well-assembled cast more than compensate with some truly impassioned performances, notably from Lew Ayres, who is simply brilliant as Paul, the young protagonist coming of age in this harsh environment. His friendship with long-time solider Katczinsky adds moments of warmth as well as sorrow, and the dialogue exchanged between the close-knit group of soldiers is both absorbing and believable, drawing you closer into their world and experiencing their own frustration and disillusionment along with them. Right from the start, we know what's inevitable for the optimistic young soldiers as they head out to the trenches, but at the same time we value their hope and innocence and yearn that they might be able to retain it all the same, making it all the more tragic as the events of the battlefield lay waste to their youthful spirits.With its gripping direction and powerful imagery, it's a film that manages to leave a considerable imprint on the viewer, and I speak from experience on that one - upon reaching the end, both myself and the entire party I viewed it with were left speechless, and it took a good couple of minutes before any of us could pluck up the courage to break that uneasy silence. I don't know for sure when I'll be up for watching it a second time, but that final feeling certainly won't be going away from me any time soon, and I can almost guarantee this the kind of film you'll be glad for watching at least once.

I found them all engrossing to various degrees... loving Fargo and Lebowski but finding Hudsucker and Miller's Crossing somewhat lacking and empty pieces.I didn't see Blood Simple until I was 18 and on my own at a small film festival in the heart of the Adirondacks. I had attended the festival to see a panel discussion on adapting novels to film (a panel featuring Milos Forman, Paul Schrader, Michael Ondaatje, an Russell Banks - all this in a rather tiny winter resort town). I decided to spend the day there, watching whatever movies sounded interesting. On the playbill, I saw that they were showing a movie by the Coen's - Blood Simple. I remembered seeing the film in the video store with its awful cover (those tacky shoes and handcuffs probably deterred me more than anything else from watching the movie until that point). I thought I'd take a chance.It was one of the finest uses of $7 in my life. Because of the panel, I arrived about 20 minutes in and was a little dis-oriented. I was nevertheless engaged completely within minutes. It was a gorgeous re-formatting of the film with vibrant colors and beautiful photography. The acting by some of my favorites, Dan Hedaya, Frances McDormand, and M. Emmett Walsh, was superb and it had the characteristic Coen dark humor that made Fargo such a gas.I was sad that I had not seen it until that afternoon.On the ride home, about two hours worth of peaks and valleys, I decided to rent it at the local video store, which I did, and thereby watched the film for the second time that day. It's safe to say that that's the first time I've ever done that and, I think, the only time.That speaks not only to the film's power but also its entertainment value. Yes, Blood Simple is very artful in its cinematography and direction and action, but it's also incredibly engaging for the audience. The plot moves along quickly and twists in unexpected directions. It's a movie that connoisseurs and laymen can enjoy together.I've gotten into many arguments in recent years with Coen fans about this movie's relative worth. Most of them are close in age to myself and are usually unfamiliar with the film. They find it hard to believe that the Coens could have made a movie that is arguably better than Fargo or Lebowski (there are some days where I like Fargo better and some days I like Blood Simple better; to me, they're the cream of the Coens' oeuvre, followed closely by The Man Who Wasn't There - an incredibly under-rated masterpiece).Believe it, please, and see this film if you have the chance.

It could have done without so much blood, even if it is only graphic, and the one scene with Jack\/Tyler doing it with Marla. It was very clever that in that scene you can't see the guy's face, which contributes to the fact that Jack and Tyler are the same person. The script was very sharp; it gives just enough hints so you can figure out that they're the same person, but it doesn't give too much away. Kudos to the writer! This is one of those movies that really make you think, since it's so unpredictable, and when you see it for the second time, you like it even more because you can just sit back and enjoy it.Fight Club has a really strong message behind it; it's not just a bunch of men getting together to hit each other and taking their angry, hurt, and disappointment out on others, it's a bunch of men trying to prove and find themselves. No, fighting doesn't solve anything, it just relieves the pain until you find it within yourself to face your problem and be free, but to do that, you have to make sacrifices (a.k.a. Jack losing all his furniture, which was exactly what Tyler, his freer half, wanted.) We all have an image of ourselves as this perfect person; what we would be like if we could remake ourselves. Tyler is this person to Jack, only his desire is so strong that Tyler becomes out of control and creates Project Mayhem. I think that was the only flaw in this movie. Something like a small fighting club to a large scale project to remake the world. But it wouldn't have had the same effect as it did would it? And the ending just clicked, it was that good.

It's faster, fresher, wittier & much better made & more fun & explores a brand new avenue in the series. Seemingly ignoring Part V, Part VI was just plain fun in my view. What's notable about this film, is that besides the plot being pretty much the same, there are indeed several new wrinkles in the films structure, in particular the tone of the film, it should be noted that despite the praise critics gave SCREAM for being classy, with it's characters being very self aware of themselves in a horror movie, Part VI invented this idea, not SCREAM! (Ironically enough McLoughlin was actually asked to direct the first SCREAM film at one point) Part VI thought up the self aware & referential angle to the horror genre, unlike previous entries, the kids know of Jason & his legend. He also adds several doses of humour, most notably in the roadside signs Dangerous Curves Ahead & Speeding? & also has characters in his script, that break the fourth wall, especially in a scene where the gravedigger stares into the camera Some folk, have a stranger idea of entertainment. Which leaves one wondering, are the makers of this film making fun of the audience of themselves? the series? it leaves it open for interpretation, as well as McLoughlin staging moments for the audience to provide the punchline & another scene where a sexist paint baller has his arm jerked out of it's socket by Jason & is thrust into a tree, to which there's a bloody smiley face carved into the tree & Tommy's run from the cops in the cemetery where Jason was buried, that is staged like a game of PAC-MAN. McLouglin also adds some strange twists on profanity & his one sex scene is not only played for laughs, but also is the only sex scene to make this instalment in this series to not feature any requisite nudity & the director wisely jettisons all the carbon copy, stereotypical characters of the previous films & makes his kids much more real & innocent. McLoughlin also stretches his low budget pretty good, he manages to stage an impressive underwater fight scene, two car chases, adds more suspense. The killings although toned down when compared to most instalments to this series, were still pretty inventive & effective in their execution & Director McLoughlin deserves credit for creating a really good horror movie with touches of humorous comedy bits. The acting & suspense was great, I particularly enjoyed David Kagen's portrayal as the tough as nails Sheriff, he was a real joy to watch & Jennifer Cooke has to be without a shadow of a doubt, the best most interesting & sexy heroine's of the entire series. The Jason make-up was really neat, there's no slow spots in the movie either, as Tom McLoughlin keeps things well paced & entertaining to keep the viewers mind from wandering. In fact, I can honestly say that Part VI is the best film alongside IV. The films has a good pace to it, witty one liners, humorous comedy bits, action, a great Gothic feel, a lead heroine that would be a guys ultimate dream girl. The character of TOMMY JARVIS has also changed, in fact, the portrayal given by Thom Mathews here & written by the director, bears almost no resemblance to the character in Parts IV & V, for starters, he doesn't wear glasses, is better looking, is no longer a troubled violent prone youth like he was in V & not once does he ever carry any of the masks he created as a child. The character as displayed here is more of a young JAMES BOND than anything & far more likable as a lead. Speaking of Bond, there's even a JAMES BOND spoof at the beginning of the film with Jason walking & turning around to thrust a machete at the audience before the credits roll. Director Mcloughlin manages to keep the films pace flowing throughout the film, giving us a high body count that seems to occur every five minutes, while at the same time, managing to keep his story from completely sinking. The kills are inventive & the rock score by ALICE COOPER coupled with a very good Gothic like score from series mainstay composer HARRY MANFREDINI really adds a magical quality to the film. McLoughlin is clearly a fan of the Hammer horror classics, in particular FRANKENSTEIN, since Jason is resurrected via a lightning bolt in a very eerie looking cemetery. Part VI is the only one after the original to set it's action at an actual camp & not a lake house cabin like the others. Another thing I feel helped the film be a bit more suspenseful than the others is in the fact that unlike the first film, where the camp was set to be opened, this camp is opened & full of kids who's lives are in danger as Jason prowls the camp & brutally hacks up the counsellors, you really wonder what Jason's intentions are for the kids, will he leave them alone? or does he want them dead too? Mcloughlin also throws in a few nifty idea's about death & the afterlife. Also worth mentioning is how the film appears to be a modern day take on the Frankenstein story. C.J. GRAHAM was perfection as Jason! My only complaint, the cemetery scenes, which are just begging for a CHRISTOPHER LEE & VINCENT PRICE cameo!

How these 2 were cured of their disease at the end of the movie when Jesus died of the cross was truly bizarre and unbelievable. How they did it in the old film, with Jesus healing them while dragging the cross, was much more believable and effective.Overall, a poor film, not worthy of it's praise.3\/10.

Sure this film may not suit every one, many people who love Lynch's other movies might feel alienated when they watch this, but if they can sit through the first half hour or so they will probably start liking it. The story is both full of joy and sorrow, and really hard not to like. The only problem I had with this movie was the slow pace, it was often relevant to have the movie as slow as it was, but sometimes it just didn't work very well.It's also very well acted. Richard Farnsworth didn't play Alvin Straight, he was Alvin Straight, clearly one of the most memorable performances I've seen.One you shouldn't miss, though it is somewhat slow at times.8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"20 November 2004","score":"","review":" Talking about an odd turn for David Lynch, the man who has brought us some seriously weird and unpleasant stuff like Lost Highway and Twin Peaks has made one of the warmest and most touching movies of the nineties.The plot is just to strange to not be true an old man visits his brother by riding a lawnmower through several states of America.

And I'm not saying my father is bad at all, but this movie just showed me how far fathers would go to save their child. This movie got me so emotional but this is such a great movie!

Every time i watch this i find new jokes that i didn't notice before, and it just seems to get funnier after each viewing, plus i can watch this a 1000 times and it never gets old!. Leslie Nielsen and Priscilla Presley have great chemistry together,and the ending was great plus,Ricardo Montalban is extremely menacing as the main villain. This is absolutely one of the funniest movies ever made, and if you have not seen it, where have you been, see it immediately!. The Direction is awesome!. David Zucker does an awesome job here, with good camera work, keeping the film funny at all times, and keeping the film at a great pace!. The Acting is fantastic!. Leslie Nielsen is AMAZING as always, and is at his absolute funniest here, he has you constantly laughing, his character, is extremely likable and he was just a lot of fun to watch, this is his best role in my opinion!. (Leslie Rules!). Priscilla Presley is very pretty, and is good with what she had to do, and had good chemistry with Leslie. Ricardo Montalban is fantastic as the main villain, was just great, i loved his lines!, he was also extremely menacing. George Kennedy is good in his supporting role, the scenes with him and Leslie are very funny. O.J.
