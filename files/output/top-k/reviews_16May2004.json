It was recommended to me so I went out and bought it and I was BLOWN AWAY. One of my favorite aspects of this film was how well the music went with the film. It takes place in the late eighties and the soundtrack includes such artists as Tears for Fears and other popular bands of the age. The musical sequences in this movie are fantastic. They carry along the story w\/o using dialogue, using only the actions of the actors. Which brings me to yet another reason I liked this film. The acting was superb. Jake Gyllenhaal was FANTASTIC as a troubled, confused teen. I am a teenager and although I do not have psychological problems, his portrayal of Donnie Darko was SPOT on with all of the other troubles and dilemmas of every day life as an adolescent. The actual script is also VERY well done. The scenes are well written and directed. My personal favorite is one in which Donnie is fighting with his family at the dinner table (lord knows that happens to all teenagers). Overall, I absolutely LOVED this movie and as a first time writer and director, I thought Richard Kelly did an absolutely FANTASTIC job. I bought this movie for TEN DOLLARS at Best Buy, so if you have 10 bucks to burn, GO BUY THIS MOVIE. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!!!

(What Would Walt Do?)  Having seen this with my goddaughter recently, I can safely say that Walt would have done  *The Little Mermaid*, and he would have done it in much the same way that director John Musker does it here.  (Though ole Walt may have looked askance at Ariel's flirty seashell bra, to say nothing of her frank sensuality.)  So how did this film save the Disney Studio?  By going Back to Basics  tirelessly detailed animation; Hans Christian Andersen; clearly delineated heroes and villains; hilariously inadequate male love interests; amusing sidekicks.  It is no accident that this movie resembles  *Snow White*  more than any other  modern  Disney cartoon  it is clearly attempting to mine, once again, the Old Stuff, the Classic Motherlode.  It was a triumphant return to form, after two decades of forgettable attempts to be more  relevant  (*Black Hole*, anyone?)  to post-Sixties audiences.Every one of the 84 minutes counts in this picture.  Not a scene is wasted, not even the musical numbers, which -- for once -- build character or advance the plot.  Lean, mean, and to the point.  Doubtless, the hand-drawn animation provided the incentive for brevity and clarity.  More recent Disney films, relying on cheaper and easier computer graphics, have shown a marked tendency of bloat.  The story's  deadline  of 3 days -- during which Ariel is magically granted legs in order to pass as human and hence make the Prince give her a true love's kiss, thereby making her human forever -- also tightens things up.  More suspense is added when the evil sea-witch Ursula, as a further condition for granting Ariel's wish to be human, removes the mermaid's magical voice -- the one thing that the Prince would recognize about her.  It should be added that evil Ursula is truly nasty as well as comical, providing just the right foil for the sweet mermaid.  Simple Good vs. Evil, here -- no  Golden Bough  moral complexity of, say, *The Lion King*, in which the animals worship the birth of the very creature who will likely grow up to eat them.  *The Little Mermaid*  keeps it simple, stupid -- Walt would've approved.

Bond wants revenge on a drug lord that has nearly killed his best friend Felix Leiter(David Hedison, reprising the role from Live and Let Die), feeding him to the sharks, an event that happened to Felix in the original Live and Let Die novel.  The authorities are to slow to act on what the criminal has done, and finding that MI6 has refused to allow him to be involved in the matter, Bond quits, and now on the run, has only two allies in his search for Sanchez, Pam Bouvier, a tough-as-nails ex-army pilot, and Major Boothroyd himself, Q, who not only provides the usual assortment of deadly devices, from an explosive alarm clock(which is never used, I might add) to a camera that turns into a sniper rifle, but also actively aids Bond in the field as well this time around.  Sanchez himself is also a great villain, he is not the typical conquer-the-world, villain like Blofeld, Drax, or even Trevalyn, he is just a crook trying to control his area of his crime market(drugs).  The film is the most violent of all 20 movies, so much in fact that the film almost received an R rating.  Sadly, these factors, as well as the huge supply of big named films that also came out in 1989, resulted in why the film bombed, as well as leading into one of the factors of the infamous Bond franchise limbo period.  The film was bashed by both critics and moviegoers alike.  However, that is not to say that LTK has gone completely without any success.  The movie has become a cult classic among many hardcore Bond fans for these reasons, so it's not that the movie was a complete failure, just something that the public may not have been ready for.

When I first saw it as a little girl I didn't understand the true concepts of the movie. I just got a little scared by the ending. Anyway, the basic concept is that 4 boys go out on a search during the summer to go look for a dead body that was rumored to be out on the tracks. The whole trip takes basically 2 days. But these 2 days teach the boys life lessons that they'll take with them forever. The story is being retold by Gordie as an adult after the passing of his friend. (Not a spoiler because IMDB.com says it in the plot outline). Throughout the story you see Gordie mature and become able to stand up for himself. Before the trip begins you see Gordie's home life is basically none at all. Ever since his brother Denny passed away (a role by the always yummy John Cusack) his parents tend to ignore him. Writing was always his escape. His friend Vern (played by a cute lil chubby Jerry O'Connell) tells the gang (also consisting of Vern-Corey Feldman<3 and Chris-the late River Phoenix) that he heard about a dead kid who went missing and is supposedly dead on the tracks. The gang jumps on the chance to go looking and they make up lies to their parents to let them go missing for 2 days. However, there is a slight problem. A bigger, more dangerous gang, also knows about this body and they want dibs on it first. The leader being a young Keifer Sutherland.This movie is definitely worth the time spent watching it. It shows compassion, caring, and basically, growing up. I think River Phoenix plays an excellent role and it shows the kind of great career he would have had as a great actor. Also it's pretty funny to watch Jerry O'Connell with a squeaky voice ;). It has laughs and tears and puts it all together pretty nicely.

Unfortunately, I saw only about an hour of this before turning it off. Besides starting off with the much taken out of context Rodney King beating, this film makes me wonder if indeed Spike Lee knows how to tell a story. His camera movements might be good, but I found myself very confused by how the story line kept jumping across. I remember one scene where, out of nowhere, the scene cuts to X's father being killed.The best way to have done this movie, in my opinion, would've been the way the book did. Start it with X meeting Alex Haley at the end of his life and have the movie go chronologically with X providing voice-over narration.

Casablanca is also one of the few places where it is possible to get free of charge to American, the free country during the war. Rick's Cafe is the coolest place in town. One day a known Czech underground leader arrives with his beautiful wife, Ilsa, to whom Rick once had a short but wonderful affair in Paris. Finally! Finally, i had the chance to view one of the most famous movies in the history, Casablanca. Some may say it's a mother to all future romantic movie, and there are indeed many things in the movie that have been copied one way or the other, but that is mainly because this movie seems to have written a small manual for how to make an interesting love drama. I haven't seen many movies this old, so who am I to judge, but there is no doubt this movie has aged like a very fine wine, even today, black and white as it is, this is still a movie that will always stand as a remarkable romantic movie, maybe even the mother of all romantic movies. I can at least say that even now, so many years after, and my young age taken in consideration, this movie still has an effect on me, and it never gets boring at all, it keeps the perfect pace for all 110 minutes, which is quite outstanding.Now for those who think Casablanca is just a romantic movie, it's not, actually it has many others aspects to it. And i think that is why this movie works so well, we see other problems being taken up, perfectly they are adjusted so there are not too many of them and the romantic issue is still the main theme, but the sub problems works well. Especially i noticed how the movie always got our interest opened for something that feels kept as a secret, for example the past of both Rick and Ilsa, before they met in Paris. That single thing was never revealed until very late in the story, which for me meant that i was constantly curious to find out more throughout the movie.The movie is quite good directed, the director have found an nearly perfect pace for the movie all along, it never gets boring and manages to be entertaining and interesting all the way through, something that i think is quite amazing, the time flew by so fast I was amazed when it ended. And that is indeed a good thing, i hate it when movies have to bring up boring sequences, and it's something that for me drags down a lot in my overall opinion, but Casablanca really impressed me on that.The acting is also quite good for this movie, acting in the earlier days are usually very different than modern days. That goes for this movie too. Best was Mr. Bogart, i actually thought he did a very good job playing a cynic man, who deep within had a heart of gold, all it took for it to open was the one woman.

I haven't seen many movies this old, so who am I to judge, but there is no doubt this movie has aged like a very fine wine, even today, black and white as it is, this is still a movie that will always stand as a remarkable romantic movie, maybe even the mother of all romantic movies. I can at least say that even now, so many years after, and my young age taken in consideration, this movie still has an effect on me, and it never gets boring at all, it keeps the perfect pace for all 110 minutes, which is quite outstanding.Now for those who think Casablanca is just a romantic movie, it's not, actually it has many others aspects to it. And i think that is why this movie works so well, we see other problems being taken up, perfectly they are adjusted so there are not too many of them and the romantic issue is still the main theme, but the sub problems works well. Especially i noticed how the movie always got our interest opened for something that feels kept as a secret, for example the past of both Rick and Ilsa, before they met in Paris. That single thing was never revealed until very late in the story, which for me meant that i was constantly curious to find out more throughout the movie.The movie is quite good directed, the director have found an nearly perfect pace for the movie all along, it never gets boring and manages to be entertaining and interesting all the way through, something that i think is quite amazing, the time flew by so fast I was amazed when it ended. And that is indeed a good thing, i hate it when movies have to bring up boring sequences, and it's something that for me drags down a lot in my overall opinion, but Casablanca really impressed me on that.The acting is also quite good for this movie, acting in the earlier days are usually very different than modern days. That goes for this movie too. Best was Mr. Bogart, i actually thought he did a very good job playing a cynic man, who deep within had a heart of gold, all it took for it to open was the one woman.

The movie won three Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Editing. I still think that it deserved more than three awards out of ten, including awards for Stallone, Shire and Meredith. Rocky also revamped the image of the boxing movie bi giving it a new look that is still imitated to this day and also made Sylvester Stallone a major movie star. There are three things in this movie to watch for the extraordinary script written by Sylvester Stallone, the score elegantly orchestrated by Bill Conti and finally, the final fight between Rocky and Apollo, which is one of the best boxing fights filmed to this day.

I am also not a great fan of sporting films in general, although there are a number of exceptions. Despite this, however, I generally love baseball films, of which there were a number of good examples in the late eighties and early nineties. ('Eight Men Out', 'Field of Dreams' and 'The Natural' all spring to mind). There is something about the sport that seems to lend itself to the cinema; perhaps British filmmakers should consider making a film about cricket, as the two sports have a lot in common. During the Second World War many of America's male baseball stars were drafted into the forces, and it appeared that the nation might be deprived of its favourite sport. An entrepreneur therefore had the idea of creating an all-female baseball league. 'A League of their Own' tells the story of some of the women who played in that league. At the centre of the drama is the rivalry between two sisters, Dottie and Kit, who sign for the same team, the Rockford Peaches. The sisters have contrasting characters. Dottie is the more talented player, but Kit is more aggressive and determined to succeed. Kit's aggression and the sibling rivalry between her and Dottie lead to dissension in the team's dressing room, and Kit is traded to a rival team, the Racine Belles. The climax of the film comes when Rockford and Racine meet in the finals of the league championship, with Kit and Dottie on opposite teams. The film has some interesting observations about the social values of the era in which it is set. During this period there was a conflict between traditional views of femininity and the need, caused by wartime conditions, for women to take on what had historically been masculine roles. Before the war, there had been only very limited opportunities for women in professional sport; most sports, such as tennis and athletics, in which women were permitted to compete were strictly amateur. During the war, they were allowed to take part, but were still expected to conform to the ideal of being 'ladylike'. In the film, players are selected as much for their sex appeal as for their talent (Ernie Capadino, the cynical, sexist talent scout, wants to leave one player out of the team because he considers her insufficiently glamorous) and they are required to attend a 'charm school' and to conform to a strict code of sexual morality. Dottie and Kit can be seen as representing the two sides of this conflict. For all her talent, Dottie's heart is not really in professional baseball, and her real wish is to return to her old life as a housewife as soon as her husband returns from the war. Kit, on the other hand, is single, and sees the game as a way of escaping from her previously dull existence. Although Geena Davis was quite good as Dottie, the two best performances came from two actors I had not previously heard of, Jon Lovitz in the cameo role of Ernie Capadino, and Lori Petty as Kit, who brought out the fierce determination and will to win of her character. I am surprised that she has not gone on to become a bigger star than she has. It was interesting to see Madonna (normally found in starring roles) in a supporting role as Mae, one of the Peaches who rebels against the strict moral code.Tom Hanks stars as Jimmy Dugan, the coach of the Rockford Peaches, in a role created largely because the filmmakers felt that they needed a big male star. Dugan was himself a famous baseball player in his time, but his career was wrecked by his heavy drinking. At the beginning of the film, Dugan is played as a figure of fun, making blunders such as urinating in front of the women, but being too drunk to notice or to care. Later on, Dugan sobers up and develops into a mixture of inspirational coach and dispenser of homespun philosophy along the lines of 'There's no crying in baseball'. At neither stage, however, does the film bring out the genuinely tragic aspects of Dugan's fall from grace as a great, or potentially great, athlete ruined by alcoholism. (One can think of modern parallels such as George Best or Diego Maradona). The actor may be at fault here; during the early part of his career Hanks always seemed a limited actor, convincing in 'Mr Nice Guy' roles but unable to portray more unsympathetic characters. ('Bonfire of the Vanities' being another example). There were one or two other things about the film that I did not like. I felt we should have seen more of Kit between her transfer to Racine and her reappearance in the finals. The opening and closing scenes, showing a reunion of the surviving players more than forty years later, did not add much to the story. (They did, however, correct the misleading impression given in the rest of the film that women's professional baseball came to an end with the war; in fact, it survived until 1954). Overall, however, this was an entertaining film, well worth watching. 7\/10.

Dottie and Kit can be seen as representing the two sides of this conflict. For all her talent, Dottie's heart is not really in professional baseball, and her real wish is to return to her old life as a housewife as soon as her husband returns from the war. Kit, on the other hand, is single, and sees the game as a way of escaping from her previously dull existence. Although Geena Davis was quite good as Dottie, the two best performances came from two actors I had not previously heard of, Jon Lovitz in the cameo role of Ernie Capadino, and Lori Petty as Kit, who brought out the fierce determination and will to win of her character. I am surprised that she has not gone on to become a bigger star than she has. It was interesting to see Madonna (normally found in starring roles) in a supporting role as Mae, one of the Peaches who rebels against the strict moral code.Tom Hanks stars as Jimmy Dugan, the coach of the Rockford Peaches, in a role created largely because the filmmakers felt that they needed a big male star. Dugan was himself a famous baseball player in his time, but his career was wrecked by his heavy drinking. At the beginning of the film, Dugan is played as a figure of fun, making blunders such as urinating in front of the women, but being too drunk to notice or to care. Later on, Dugan sobers up and develops into a mixture of inspirational coach and dispenser of homespun philosophy along the lines of 'There's no crying in baseball'. At neither stage, however, does the film bring out the genuinely tragic aspects of Dugan's fall from grace as a great, or potentially great, athlete ruined by alcoholism. (One can think of modern parallels such as George Best or Diego Maradona). The actor may be at fault here; during the early part of his career Hanks always seemed a limited actor, convincing in 'Mr Nice Guy' roles but unable to portray more unsympathetic characters. ('Bonfire of the Vanities' being another example). There were one or two other things about the film that I did not like. I felt we should have seen more of Kit between her transfer to Racine and her reappearance in the finals. The opening and closing scenes, showing a reunion of the surviving players more than forty years later, did not add much to the story. (They did, however, correct the misleading impression given in the rest of the film that women's professional baseball came to an end with the war; in fact, it survived until 1954). Overall, however, this was an entertaining film, well worth watching. 7\/10.  ","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Sport"},{"date":"16 May 2004","score":"43 out of 52 people found the following review useful","review":"  Like most Englishmen, I know about as much about baseball as the average American knows about cricket. I am also not a great fan of sporting films in general, although there are a number of exceptions. Despite this, however, I generally love baseball films, of which there were a number of good examples in the late eighties and early nineties. ('Eight Men Out', 'Field of Dreams' and 'The Natural' all spring to mind). There is something about the sport that seems to lend itself to the cinema; perhaps British filmmakers should consider making a film about cricket, as the two sports have a lot in common. During the Second World War many of America's male baseball stars were drafted into the forces, and it appeared that the nation might be deprived of its favourite sport. An entrepreneur therefore had the idea of creating an all-female baseball league. 'A League of their Own' tells the story of some of the women who played in that league. At the centre of the drama is the rivalry between two sisters, Dottie and Kit, who sign for the same team, the Rockford Peaches. The sisters have contrasting characters. Dottie is the more talented player, but Kit is more aggressive and determined to succeed. Kit's aggression and the sibling rivalry between her and Dottie lead to dissension in the team's dressing room, and Kit is traded to a rival team, the Racine Belles. The climax of the film comes when Rockford and Racine meet in the finals of the league championship, with Kit and Dottie on opposite teams. The film has some interesting observations about the social values of the era in which it is set. During this period there was a conflict between traditional views of femininity and the need, caused by wartime conditions, for women to take on what had historically been masculine roles. Before the war, there had been only very limited opportunities for women in professional sport; most sports, such as tennis and athletics, in which women were permitted to compete were strictly amateur. During the war, they were allowed to take part, but were still expected to conform to the ideal of being 'ladylike'. In the film, players are selected as much for their sex appeal as for their talent (Ernie Capadino, the cynical, sexist talent scout, wants to leave one player out of the team because he considers her insufficiently glamorous) and they are required to attend a 'charm school' and to conform to a strict code of sexual morality.

My wife, however, who is herself Chinese, tells me that in the Far East there is a tradition of using martial arts elements in many different cinematic genres, including historical romances. 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is a rare example of a film of this type to have achieved success in the West. Set in Imperial china, it tells the story of two warriors, Li Mu Bai (male) and Yu Shu Lien (female) and their attempts to recover a valuable sword which has been stolen by a young girl named Jen Yu. Jen is the daughter of a wealthy aristocratic family, and outwardly a respectable young lady, but she is secretly in revolt against her background and the limited possibilities open to her, and has secretly been receiving martial arts training from a notorious outlaw named Jade Fox. (Also a woman; strong female characters are a tradition in martial arts films).Intertwined with the action sequences are two love stories; one between Jen and her bandit lover Lo, the other between Li Mu Bai and Yu Shu Lien, who are obliged to hide their feelings for one another by the austere warrior code to which they subscribe. I found that the romance between Jen and the desert nomad Lo was never quite convincing; it seemed like the East Asian equivalent of those old Hollywood desert epics where the heroine ends up falling in love with the sheikh who has kidnapped and ravished her. The love between Li Mu Bai and Yu Shu Lien, however, although at times it is so repressed as to be virtually invisible, does lead to the most poignant and tragic scene in the film when they realize their feelings for each other when it is too late. Although I could never believe in her love for Lo, the character of Jen is an interesting and ambiguous one. At one level she is an arrogant and spoilt brat, whose mischief-making leads to pain and suffering for others. At another level, however, I found myself sympathising with her and her impatience with her stifling conformist background where she is expected to be dutiful and obedient and to achieve nothing in life other than to marry the boy of her parents' choice. Her theft of the sword can be seen both as wanton disobedience and as a necessary act of justified rebellion. The lovely Zhang Ziyi, who seems set to succeed the luminously beautiful Gong Li as the queen of Chinese cinema, did well to suggest both sides of her character. Of the other characters, Michelle Yeoh as Yu Shu Lien was probably the best; Chow Yun-Fat as Li Mu Bai seemed rather too stolid.What really made the film stand out, however, was its visual beauty. This may seem a strange quality to praise in a martial arts film, but the fight scenes were the most beautiful of all, particularly those between Yu Shu Lien and Jen. I should point out that this is in no sense a realistic film. The characters have powers that verge on the supernatural (although in the context of the film this is attributed to their rigorous martial arts training). They are able to run up vertical walls, float through the trees, bound effortlessly across the rooftops and leap high into the air and hover there. This is achieved not by computer-generated effects but by stunt work on wires, often performed by the stars themselves rather than by stunt doubles. The result is a strange, breathtaking aerial ballet of an exquisite beauty which contributes to making this a haunting, surrealist film. 8\/10.
