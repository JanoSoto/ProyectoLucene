Mr. Tom Ripley later in the movie kills Dickie and lies to Marge about what happened to Dickie, by saying that he left. The movie seems to be kind of dull in the beginning until the scene where Tom Ripley murders Dickie. That is when you learn more about Mr. Ripley that he is a psychopath. He spends time with Marge and he goes around disguising himself as Dickie around one of his other girlfriends Meredith (Cate Blanchett).What makes this movie slightly confusing is that at times the plot got scrambled, sometimes it looked like everyone knew that Mr. Ripley murdered Dickie, but at other times it looked like everybody was oblivious to what he did. What really shows that Mr. Ripley is a psychopath was when he killed another person in the movie, Freddie Miles, wondering where Dickie is (Phillip Semoyur Hoffman). The confusing part was the ending when he met another person, a homosexual named Peter (Jack Davenport). At the end of the movie, they are together on a boat, and nothing happens to Mr. Ripley, except that he disguises himself as Dickie still. But still this movie was very intriguing, a little strange, but a movie I would highly recommend. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"28 June 2003","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  SPOILERS COULD BE IN THIS REVIEW The story starts with when Mr. Ripley (Matt Damon) is sent to help bring a father's playboy son Dickie (Jude Law) back home.

And I think at the time of this release we had gotten Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Star Wars so our expectation levels were running higher for special effects and whimsy than this.But I still can get entertainment out of this film.How?By remembering how old I was when I saw it and WHOM I was with when I saw it. My family.I was a child. This film wasn't in my all time top ten, but it was...fun. It was one of those movies local channels threw on Sunday afternoon before or after a televised ball game..or when a ball game was rained out. Come on, admit it..you remember!And that's the point. This film's special effects were nice..not spectacular..not even up to Ray Harryhausen's standards, but the Harryhausen mark was there which made it entertaining (Admit it, you LOVED the walrus scene!! How 'bout that Cyclops?!?! As a child this was all good! You remember!!).For very young girls, this Sinbad was REALLY nice to look at back then. For the very young guys, so was Miss Jane Seymour and Miss Taryn Power. Then there was the story which was kinda fun, the adventure which was kinda whimsical and the happy ending where the bad guys got theirs'.This was done at a time of assuming children would love this kinda stuff. Back then, more would have. Now, most children don't even think Spy Kids can give them a buzz.This movie is about childhood and remembering what it was like to have an imagination and watch a story unfold for nothing but the sheer enjoyment of it...the fun of eating Good 'n' Plenty, Snowcaps, Malted Milk Balls and Popcorn without thinking about calorie content to make this even more fun to watch...and the eye candy of Wayne, Seymour and Power help a so-so story that's really better than a lot of stuff I've seen today that they charge ya $10 a ticket for! Parents may not have liked it as much as the children but that too is part of the fun!Have a heart when watching this. Watch this as a fun romp....as remembering when families watched shows together (..or in my case my dad mumbling under his breath about how the game was due on and he had to sit through this 'crap' first!), the pre-teen tingles of watching a handsome Wayne, young Seymour and\/or Power (...ya know...before having breast implants and weighing 95 pounds was mandatory in Hollywood for women to do this kind of film work?!?) and telling your parents you were REALLY interested in the story...really.Maybe I've got a more nostalgic view about this film..its because I'm not looking for academy award winning material with this kind of film, but it does its job of...entertaining...and if you have children and want them to be children for a tad longer, this may be the film fare for them. Or just for you, if you want to curl up with some popcorn and remember the good old movie fluff days where special effects were done by hand and stop motion photography by the grand-daddy of the genre and a Sinbad movie where Sinbad actually looked like you might imagined him to look like back then and evil characters who were evil and got theirs....pretty much simplified.Open your mind and when you have a moment...enjoy. Don't take it seriously just sit back... watch...and HAVE FUN..with your children, as a family.

However, one thing has bothered me for years. While it is sad and stunning to see mankind reduced to such a state, I don't know how realistic it is to see so many people willingly commit suicide. Of course, we did see that many years later in the real life incident at Jonestown, but that was more murder at the hands of a religous fanatic than suicide.Humankind has always had a built-in survival instinct. If not, then we might not be here now talking about this film. We live in a hostile environment, whether through nature or at our own hands, but we have managed to last through all of it. AIDS is as hopeless and devastating a disease as radiation poisoining and yet there are some patients who have denied the inevitable and are still alive. There is something in mankind that simply refuses to give up.A previous poster mentioned the lack of anyone in this film even considering building an underground shelter in advance of the inevitable. I think that is a good point. The final scene shows a sign that reads, There Is Still Time...Brother. Perhaps they should have taken that to heart and tried to find a way to save someone before it was too late. Instead we have people simply walking around in a daze and the only people who show any life, seem to be trying to find ways to accelerate their demise, such as in a brutal and absurd car race that promises only death as the final prize.The scene near the end with the young sailor and his wife in bed reminiscing about how they met, on the beach, was touching but her sudden announcement that she's ready to have that cup of tea now, does not ring true. People who have not seen it, should check out the Showtime reprise of this film, from a few years ago. That scene is done in a far more emotional manner, with the couple sobbing as they end their lives in bed with their crying child between them. It is admittedly hard to watch, but looks far more realistic than what is done here, with the child not even on screen. You can't have it both ways.If you're going to show the end of the world and the despair of people to such a degree that they would even consider such a thing, you need to take it all the way and not pull any punches at the end.In spite of this reservation, this film and the book it is based on, remains an object lesson for all of humanity. It should be required viewing and reading for all world leaders who dare to place themselves ahead of and above the safety and the survival of the very people they profess to lead.

You can't have it both ways.If you're going to show the end of the world and the despair of people to such a degree that they would even consider such a thing, you need to take it all the way and not pull any punches at the end.In spite of this reservation, this film and the book it is based on, remains an object lesson for all of humanity. It should be required viewing and reading for all world leaders who dare to place themselves ahead of and above the safety and the survival of the very people they profess to lead.

Other than that it was incredibly predictable and sad. So there are these people who work with bats. One is the sexy smart, save-the-day woman and the other is the comic-relief black guy. They are asked to go to the town of Gallop, Texas to help with the bat problem. They meet a tough cowboy guy, and the scientist who created the evil bats. The scientist looks scary and drops subtle hints. Bats attack, they barricade a school (why a school? I don't know). They play opera music, the black guy doesn't like it, hilarity ensues. Then they get attacked by the evil bats. Shockingly, the chicken-wire doesn't hold them off. Equally shockingly, the generator doesn't work, so they can't electrocute the bats. And, most shockingly of all, the scientist guy tells us that he created the evil bats... ON PURPOSE. Then the bats kill him, the rest go to the bat cave and kill all the bats and they all live happily ever after. Bad, bad movie.
