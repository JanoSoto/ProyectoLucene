This thing was battered back in 1996 when it was released by movie critics, because of everything from the storyline to the sound track to Robert De Niro's haircut. First of all, the storyline, in my opinion, actually better than what everybody says (it isnt great, but Gigli would be a rated a 6 with a storyline of The Fan quality.). Second of all, that is one good sountrack. When you can get all the quality songs from Gimme Shelter to Nine Inch Nails tunes on your soundtrack, you have hit the jackpot. And lastly, De Niro is a great actor, no matter what his haircut is.OK, all ratings aside, lets get to my full view of the The Fan. (Spoliers herein).The story revolves around the frustrated, unemployed Gil Renard (De Niro), who, despite all his problems surrounding his job and family, seems ecstatic about the big aquisition of Bobby Rayburn (Wesley Snipes)from the Atlanta Braves, for $40 million big ones. Renard is a huge Giants fan, the kind of fan who keeps team memorabilia and wears a team watch, and the kind that will skip work just for opening day. Renard isnt doing good at work however, showing up late for work and ignoring the orders of his boss, so he soon becomes a former employee for his company. To make matters worse, he is divorced, and is having troubles with his wife and his young son Richie, who he only gets to see with parenting time.Deniro is most definately the protagonist here, and a pretty good one too. We follow the Renard character throughout the movie, and his deteroiration too. We find that Renard is a very troubled character, who seems to not be able to handle the curve balls thrown at him in life (he proves this with the comment baseball is better than life. its fair). He is also very obsessive too, especially when he talks about how him and Coop could have made the big leagues.If there is anything wrong with this movie, it is the overuse of the music. Certain points deserved music (ie. the bug getting stabbed, the Gimme Shelter scene), but there was way too much music played in this movie, possibly more than i have ever heard in one movie before. The acting here was great, Deniro turned in another great performance, with Snipes and company turning in good supporting roles.Overall, a good movie, one that shouldn't be taken too seriously, but rather should be watched as some entertainment.7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"4 October 2003","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  This is a film that I have to consider underrated.

The film is set during the Depression, in the Coens' version of the deep south, a south that glows with the gold tones of a sepia tinted photograph and features a supporting cast of weird and wonderful characters. Loosely based on Homer's Odyssey, it features George Clooney as Ulysses Everett McGill, a convict who escapes from a chain gang with 2 dim-witted side kicks, Pete (John Turturro) and Delmar (Tim Nelson Blake), in a bid to stop his ex-wife from remarrying.  Along the way they meet a blind oracle, a young black gee-tar player who has sold his soul to the devil, a manic-depressive bank robber, a trio of seductive sirens, an evil one-eyed Bible salesman, and also manage to influence the race for the governorship of the state of Mississippi, integrate the races in the deep south, and have a hit record as The Soggy Bottom Boys.Clooney proves to be more than capable of handling himself in the Coen comedy universe, and gets some of the funniest moments of the film as the hair-obsessed Everett (the image of Clooney in a hair-net is one that is not going to go away).  Everett is a feckless petty crook, not nearly as smart as he thinks he is, but in the kingdom of the witless, the half-witted man is king.  Pete and Delmar are truly witless (dumber than a bag of hammers), and much of the film's comedy comes from their prat-falling and face pulling,  but just as much comes from the wonderful dialogue, which in places is so sharp it could cut itself.Pappy O'Daniel `Thank God your mammy died givin' birth. If she'd a seen ya she'd a died of shame!'Everett `Well ain't this place a geographical oddity, two weeks from everywhere!'Tommy `I had to be at that there crossroads last midnight, to sell my soul to the devil.' Everett `Well ain't it a small world, spiritually speakin'?  Pete and Delmar just been baptised and saved. I guess I'm the only one that remains unaffiliated.' Delmar `Oh son. And for that you traded your ever-lasting soul?' Tommy `Well I wasn't usin' it.'Throw in the wonderful gospel and blue-grass soundtrack, the tendency of many of the major characters to burst into song, the slightly over-the-top (in a good way) acting, and the dreamy, slightly out of reality quality of the southern setting, and the film starts to have the feel of an old-fashioned feel-good musical.  This culminates in a rally of the Klu Klux Klan, which is choreographed like an MGM musical, with marching blocks of knights of the KKK performing an elaborate dance and forming the shape of the cross.  Like the dance dream sequence at the bowling alley in The Big Lebowski, this is totally unexpected, but completely at one with the universe they have created.  The plot of the movie is rambling and episodic, much like the work on which it is based, with characters drifting in and out of the narrative, and no big emotional pay-off at the end - but that doesn't matter. What matters is the journey, and it's a journey well worth taking. Where else would you get to see a cow on the roof of a cotton shack, or a police van that shoots itself up from the inside out.

It has something to say, and certain images and scenes evoke feelings and ring true or are funny and cool.  The tone is actually that this is an extraordinary movie that you either get or you don't.  The trouble is, I think I got it, and it still wasn't that great.  I think it might just boil down to this  Bill Murray gets to our hearts and makes us laugh easier than Gene Hackman, who needs tailor-made material to do it.  You can even see that here, as it is Hackman's show with Murray, unfortunately, only a bit player.  The last scene, where Murray says Oh, God no, about something the touring boy can't do, made me wish we had seen more of him throughout the movie.  Oh well, we  always have Rushmore.

Brian De Palma has delivered a top notch film here. Everything in it is at the top of its game. The score is fantastic, as well is the writing.The acting is top notch. This film tells the tale of Al Capone , the vicious and sadistic gang lord of Chicago in the 1920's (played EXCELLENTLY by Robert De Niro). Capone runs everything and everyone in the city. No one will stand up to him. But one man has the courage. That man is Elliot Ness (Kevin Costner in the role he was born to play). Elliot Ness is portrayed as a man who believes in good and truth, and a man who wants to clean up a dirty town. While he is good of heart, he is naive about how to do it. He meets a man named Jimmy Malone (Sean Connery in the role that finally won him a much deserved Oscar). Malone , much like Ness, has a good heart but unlike Ness, he knows how to fight Capone. He schools Ness in the way to get Capone shoot fast and shoot first! After Ness assembles a gang of men with morals like his called The Untouchables , the wage their righteous war on Capone and his henchman. Everything about this film is excellent. But the man who owned this film was Kevin Costner. He has had plenty of experience playing heroic good guys, but this is his performance. No one else seems right for this role. He plays Ness as an everyday man who decides to do some good in a bad town. Hats off to Andy Garcia, who plays one Of Ness' best friends George Stone, a straight arrow, loyal memeber of Ness' gang.

Far from the studio romantic comedies of the likes of Nora Ephron, Sprecher focuses her lens on the tiny everyday minutia of life and seeks to find and show some meaning in it all. Her movies work and are so fascinating &#150; at least the 2 she's made so far - because it seems as though she really believes in it instead of playing to an audience. Also unlike Ephron, Sprecher films will be ones to admit that not everything comes out happy or wrapped up in a neat little package. Her first film, &#145;Clockwatchers' (1997), knocked me out in this regard (9.0 out of 10). What we thought was going to be a quirky independent film about the wacky shenanigans of 4 women temps became a quiet stewing in the general malaise of office life. That was a film so fresh and surprising that grabbed me and took me for a ride. '13 Conversations' doesn't have that sense of surprise, nor does it have a backdrop at which to base, and bat around, its lofty ideas. With '13 Conversations' Sprecher has set out to make a movie about nothing short of life itself.  Sprecher, and co-writer Karen Sprecher, use the now fairly common technique since &#145;Pulp Fiction' of giving us several seemingly unrelated storylines and cleverly tying them all together before the final scene.  I have to admit I love this plot structure, watching it all come together. However, instead of letting the actions and characters inspire us in pontificating the film's greater themes Sprecher puts the cart before the horse, giving us the point and then making it again just in different ways. When the stories do connect it is in moments few and far between. By sidestepping story and characters she puts all her eggs in one basket essentially thinking that a movie about life, fate and the cosmos is profound in and of itself. With gusts of wind and twists of fate, `Life' is practically another character in the movie &#150; and not just another character, but a big star that the studio shelled out 20 million bucks to get and insist his face be shoved in ours for as much of the screen time as possible. Unfortunately, Sprecher's love of the abstract ideas results in a movie where the theme overtakes the plot and swallows the characters. A movie where I didn't end up liking it as much as I like the idea of it and it's intentions.   Matthew McConaughey (against type), Clea DuVall, Amy Irving, John Turturro and Alan Arkin all give terrific performances. Sprecher gets them all to stare blank faced into the camera and talk in monotone voices as much as M. Knight Shyamalan. Another big problem is that not all the stories are that interesting. As the movie cycles between them we grow fond of some and tired of others all unbeknownst to Sprecher. Clea DuVall and Amy Irving's stories fail to carry their water and McConaughey's hit and run becomes tiresome. The most interesting and purely entertaining of the lot is John Turturro's - who is just about forgotten as the movie progresses - and Alan Arkin's. Arkin's particularly, which starts out telling us of a man who is constantly happy to the annoyance of his boss and co-workers. Arkin's story successfully gives off the feeling of a the classic domestic &#145;Twilight Zone' episode. So cheerful and ordinary that it's almost creepy and sends us waiting for the other shoe to drop.  Sprecher is a phenomenal director. It's just here she seems to be trying to do it all - make a movie about everything for everyone. While, none of the characters beyond Arkin's are that interesting it's not easy to tell at first glance because the Sprechers have put such terrific dialogue in their mouths. She broaches the abstract - things she desperately wants to talk about, but just puts so many balls in the air that the movie sprawls out of her grasp and into abstract, detached nothingness itself. But it's an admirable effort, worth a look, that few others would attempt. And I must say the ending is classic. Tightly and cleverly executed in a cinematic world of drawn out and overly explained fade outs, it's one that leaves you in the seat in silence for a moment after it has ended.

But, however, believe it gets more hype then it deserves. Don't get me wrong, this flick is *beyond* great, but it's a far cry from a masterpiece if you ask me. But before anyone attacks me, allow me to explain.I really felt that the movie was to much focused on Jack and Rose. This isn't a bad thing all, but their wasn't alot of chemistry between them. I suppose I can't complain about it to much, hence the fact James Cameron cut out a lot of scenes that showed their relation development. Many historical scenes suffered the same thing, and it was very disappointing to me. The story is well-presented, though, and it's not your average ''rich girl falls in love with rich boy'' tale. The Actors do a good job portraying their roles, especially Billy Zane, who simply makes his character, Cal Hockley, come alive. Special effects are pretty good to, but, feel somewhat animated (mainly the ''Flying'' scene and the shot of the *CGI* man falling from the stern).Their is also many historical flaws in the movie, one of them has to do with the fourth funnel, which in reality was used as a dummy and also to amuse (a liner having four funnels what something symbolic back then) passengers on the TITANIC, but in this film, it's seen puffing smoke. Molly Brown's character was poorly portrayed, she looked like a complete wimp when one of the crewmen yelled at her (the scene should have been the other way around).

Iures is frankly charismatic, on the order of Yves Montand, and is the only character given any developmental background.  That is to say, the performances aren't bad -- but the movie is. Where to begin.1.  We meet Clooney at a Senate hearing while he is being asked to account for his arrest during a fist fight in a saloon in the company of a foreign spy and a prostitute.  He's one of those roguish wisecracking mavericks we are supposed to like immediately.  (In case you don't like fist fights, foreign spies, or whores, he has an explanation that absolves him of depraved tastes.)2.  The dialogue is ineffable.  We've got AUTHORIZATION, boys!

There are the Russians of course, since we can't seem to get over the Cold War.  And then the German are shown hard at work doing evil, a stretch, true, but still World War II was no pink tea.  The chief villain describes himself as a Serb, a Croat, and a Moslem.  Iraq is brought up in the first few minutes, and the stolen nukes are headed towards Iraq.  North Korea was not invited to the party.4.  The action scenes were I'm sure generated by computer.  A truck entering a bridge is blasted by a helicopter, swerves wildly, knocking down utility poles and whipping around cables that emit sparkling fountains, before finally smashing through the railing and being jolted to a halt by the cables now wrapped around its axle.  Clooney is dropped onto the truck bed by cable from a helicopter.  A surving villain knocks the pistol out of his hand and we get the obligatory shot of it skidding across the floor out of reach.  Another fist fight while the cables snap their stops one by one and the truck dips farther off the edge of the bridge.  (Cf., the elevator scene at the beginning of Speed.)  The helicopter crew decides the truck is about to take its final nose dive and they yank Clooney back up, but the cable was somehow wrapped around his neck and is strangling him, so he whips out a knife and cuts the metal cable in one swipe.  He drops back into the truck, finishes off the heavy, saves the stolen nukes, and the truck finally pulls loose of its encumberances and drops towards the gorge below, exploding halfway down, and leaving a Harvard-educated Pakistani astrophysicist dangling from a bridge girder.  (None of this is made up, I swear.)5.  Clooney, Kidman, and an accomplice complete a dangerous theft and make off happily in their car.  The accomplice mentions that they are in an embassy car so it's armor plated and has bulletproof windows.  I leave you to guess whether this datum turns out to be important in the next 60 seconds.6.  Those cars skidding and twirling and pirouetting along the rain-slick streets of Vienna, the driver, Clooney, having presumably learned his skills at the feet of Remi Julian or however it's spelled.7.  Iures intends to explode a nuke at the UN Building but is wounded and goes to ground a few blocks away.  Clooney poses the perfectly reasonable question of why Iures just doesn't blow the thing up now, since it will take out half of New York City.  Kidman shouts back, You don't UNDERSTAND.  That's not what he wants.  He wants his death to MEAN something!  Well, you can tell just from this exchange that Iures is a man of no mean principle.

Kidman must figure out how to disarm the primer so that only the pre-primer will explode (or something).  She hacks at the fiendish device with fingernails, screwdriver, and pistol butt, while Clooney counts aloud the number of seconds remaining.  Nine.  Eight.  Hurry up!  Seven.  Doing the countdown in a situation like this, it's true, is a dirty and thankless task, but somebody's got to do it!My mind is so benumbed by exposure to radiation leakage that I can no longer count past eight.

Following the release of LICENCE TO KILL, MGM and United Artists became involved with legal issues that would last until 1992 and prevent another Bond film from being made for six years. During that time, Timothy Dalton, in my opinion the best actor to play James Bond, resigned. An actor who had originally been chosen to play the role in 1987 before being called back to REMINGTON STEELE, Pierce Brosnan, was selected. The stakes were high for this Bond adventure; the Cold War was over and conventional Hollywood wisdom stated James Bond was dead and that action films suffer when released in the winter. Both were defied, and GOLDENEYE remains the most successful Bond film in terms of generating revenue.The film replaces the Fleming-style dark Bond with a more Connery-esque style, harkening back to DR. NO and GOLDFINGER. Pierce Brosnan's Bond combines elements from all the previous actors; Connery's womanizing and overall style, Lazenby's compassion, Moore's reliance on gadgets and humor, and Dalton's vunerability; but it is largely Connery's style that is used. Brosnan carries the film successfully and plays a great Bond. I personally would've prefered them staying with a Fleming-esque style; in scenes where Dalton would've been nervous, tense, and anxious, Bronsan remains to calm, and for a man who lost his wife, he seems far to compassionate towards his ladies; but it works all the same. His portayl of Bond relfects that this character is from an era long since over, but finds his place in the world today. This film plays a twist on the villain. He plans to make millions, but isn't rich to start with. His main motivation is the British betraying his parents in WWII. And he is a former ally and close personal friend to 007; Alec Trevelyan, alias 006. The British felt he was too young to remember the events of WWII and Bond's changing their plan at the beginning of the film in Bond's final mission in the Cold War era results in the right half of his face scarred, hence his new name; Janus, the two-faced Roman god. Sean Bean plays the role magnificently and is completely believable. Bond's woman in this film is more a liberated woman of the 90s, but surprisingly, is less Bond's equal and less heroic then four of her predecessors; Pam Bouvier of LICENCE TO KILL, Melina Havelock of FOR YOUR EYES ONLY, Pussy Galore of GOLDFINGER, and last but certainly not least, Teresa di Vicenzo of ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE (a brief, indirect reference to her is made by Alec). The villainess are Xenia Onatopp, played by X-MEN's Famke Janssen. She looks different in this film, but still is great for the role. Alan Cumming, also from X-MEN, appeares as the double-crossing computer geek Boris, a humorous character. The Russian general, the other villain, I found to be over-the-top and too one dimensional. Desmond Llewelyn returns as Q, but is the only veteran Bond actor; Robert Brown and Caroline Bliss resigned from their roles as M and Moneypenny. The latter is now played by Samantha Bond, in a much more modern and enjoyable style then her predecessors while still retaining Lois Maxwell's grace and charm. The M in this film is not Sir Miles Messervy, but a new superior, a woman. She is as tough as her predecessor, and Judi Dench helps return to the M\/Bond scenes what was lost when Bernard Lee died. Despite her skill in the role, Nobody Does it Better then Lee. Joe Don Baker, who previously played the villainous Brad Whitaker in THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS, returns as Felix Leiter's CIA replacement Jack Wade. He is another comedic character and one the audience enjoys. Rounding out the cast is Robbie Coltrane as Valentine Zukovsky, an enemy-turned ally of Bond's from the Cold War.The film has more faults then has been stated, however. At times, the special effects look rather fake, including the use of bluescreen CGI in sequences where models and miniatures would've been far more effective. The film's music is pleasant to listen to but not Bond enough and often works against the scenes. As I said before, the heroine isn't tough enough and one of the villains is over the top. And sometimes Janssen's accent is too shaky.The film's faults don't give a lot of damage and it is a very good match-up with GOLDFINGER. I give it an 8 out of 10.

Following the release of LICENCE TO KILL, MGM and United Artists became involved with legal issues that would last until 1992 and prevent another Bond film from being made for six years. During that time, Timothy Dalton, in my opinion the best actor to play James Bond, resigned. An actor who had originally been chosen to play the role in 1987 before being called back to REMINGTON STEELE, Pierce Brosnan, was selected. The stakes were high for this Bond adventure; the Cold War was over and conventional Hollywood wisdom stated James Bond was dead and that action films suffer when released in the winter. Both were defied, and GOLDENEYE remains the most successful Bond film in terms of generating revenue.The film replaces the Fleming-style dark Bond with a more Connery-esque style, harkening back to DR. NO and GOLDFINGER. Pierce Brosnan's Bond combines elements from all the previous actors; Connery's womanizing and overall style, Lazenby's compassion, Moore's reliance on gadgets and humor, and Dalton's vunerability; but it is largely Connery's style that is used. Brosnan carries the film successfully and plays a great Bond. I personally would've prefered them staying with a Fleming-esque style; in scenes where Dalton would've been nervous, tense, and anxious, Bronsan remains to calm, and for a man who lost his wife, he seems far to compassionate towards his ladies; but it works all the same. His portayl of Bond relfects that this character is from an era long since over, but finds his place in the world today. This film plays a twist on the villain. He plans to make millions, but isn't rich to start with. His main motivation is the British betraying his parents in WWII. And he is a former ally and close personal friend to 007; Alec Trevelyan, alias 006. The British felt he was too young to remember the events of WWII and Bond's changing their plan at the beginning of the film in Bond's final mission in the Cold War era results in the right half of his face scarred, hence his new name; Janus, the two-faced Roman god. Sean Bean plays the role magnificently and is completely believable. Bond's woman in this film is more a liberated woman of the 90s, but surprisingly, is less Bond's equal and less heroic then four of her predecessors; Pam Bouvier of LICENCE TO KILL, Melina Havelock of FOR YOUR EYES ONLY, Pussy Galore of GOLDFINGER, and last but certainly not least, Teresa di Vicenzo of ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE (a brief, indirect reference to her is made by Alec). The villainess are Xenia Onatopp, played by X-MEN's Famke Janssen. She looks different in this film, but still is great for the role. Alan Cumming, also from X-MEN, appeares as the double-crossing computer geek Boris, a humorous character. The Russian general, the other villain, I found to be over-the-top and too one dimensional. Desmond Llewelyn returns as Q, but is the only veteran Bond actor; Robert Brown and Caroline Bliss resigned from their roles as M and Moneypenny. The latter is now played by Samantha Bond, in a much more modern and enjoyable style then her predecessors while still retaining Lois Maxwell's grace and charm. The M in this film is not Sir Miles Messervy, but a new superior, a woman. She is as tough as her predecessor, and Judi Dench helps return to the M\/Bond scenes what was lost when Bernard Lee died. Despite her skill in the role, Nobody Does it Better then Lee. Joe Don Baker, who previously played the villainous Brad Whitaker in THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS, returns as Felix Leiter's CIA replacement Jack Wade. He is another comedic character and one the audience enjoys. Rounding out the cast is Robbie Coltrane as Valentine Zukovsky, an enemy-turned ally of Bond's from the Cold War.The film has more faults then has been stated, however. At times, the special effects look rather fake, including the use of bluescreen CGI in sequences where models and miniatures would've been far more effective. The film's music is pleasant to listen to but not Bond enough and often works against the scenes. As I said before, the heroine isn't tough enough and one of the villains is over the top. And sometimes Janssen's accent is too shaky.The film's faults don't give a lot of damage and it is a very good match-up with GOLDFINGER. I give it an 8 out of 10.

When Paul Giamatti is turned blue, I lose my breath. It is an incredible metaphor, although many may disagree. Our fearless hero, Jason (played by Shakespearean and longtime theater actor Frankie Muniz), is reminiscent of Ben Hur and Lawrence of Arabia. In other words, a character so powerful and awe-inspiring, it makes you believe that they are almost a second coming of good old JC himself. The scene where Jason (Muniz) and female lead Amanda Bynes try on clothes and props in the movie studio may make you laugh, but it proves to be the film's most poignant and memorable scene. This too is a metaphor, for trying different things in life. In other words, next time you feel like breaking into a movie studio and aimlessly knocking props over and wearing movie costumes that actually do cost money, do it. And that is an important message to get from the movie.
