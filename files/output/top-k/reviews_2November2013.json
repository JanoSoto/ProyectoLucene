[{"date":"2 November 2013","score":"","review":" 5.7 ! I can't believe how underrated this movie is. This is genuine,powerful drama. The first segment highlights the courtship of Amy and Virgil. It went well and stomped somewhat familiar ground and we thought it would pace the movie into expected and nice conclusion. The middle segment dealt with the operation and how Virgil had to retrain his brain to new-found vision as adult. ***SPOILER*** then the last segment makes an unexpected,tragic and cruel turn. If it was gut- wrenching to watch imagine how the real life Virgil for whom this true story was based on must have felt. Then the epilogue and closing remarks about the real Amy and Virgil. This is powerful stuff. Val Klimer I thought was as action kick-butt guy only - was I wrong! He intelligently plays the first blind Virgil who had reconciled himself, then as the sighted Virgil who had to relearn everything as an adult, and lastly the at-peace Virgil again when he went blind again. In between sighted and then blindness he saw his older sister for first time, commented how beautiful she was and how she had given up life to take care of him, having both been abandoned by their runaway dad. His relationship with Amy is more complicated. He needs her but wants to have some Independence, while Amy is all loving and supportive. To provide some irony Amy had brief moment close to submitting to Duncan, the scheming ex-husband who wants them back together again. But it was too brief a moment and Amy affirmed her love to Virgil by abruptly breaking away from Duncam. We see these characters in real life. They are around us. They are us. Just like having doubts about Val Klimer, I had initial doubt about Mira Sorvino who too often associates with light comedy. Here She was caring and devoted to Virgil and shows she never lost sight of who she is. Kelly McGillis' protective, self- sacrificing big sister was believable. I spent my whole life looking down, checking for pot holes so Virgil wouldn't fall in, she said. The medical staff was convincing. Ken Howard's brief but important appearance delivered the counterpoint. The script was intelligently written and many details about how the blinds adjust to their environment display careful research. This is the movie if you are in the mood for a well-acted and powerful drama. ","genre":null},{"date":"2 November 2013","score":"","review":" 5.7 ! I can't believe how underrated this movie is.
