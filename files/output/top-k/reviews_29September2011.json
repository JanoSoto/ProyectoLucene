To my compleat and utter shock, as the end titles ran, the words Directed by John Frankenheimer roll by.My Jaw Dropped in Disbelief, the same director that gave us the Original Manchurian Candidate, The Train and Grand Prix directed this? Comparing this film to Grand Prix I can now see some similarities. On my first viewing of Ronin, I did not guess in my wildest dreams that Frankenheimer was involved.Robert DeNiro, Stellan Skarsgård, Sean Bean, Jean Reno and Skipp Sudduth are four Mercenaries, or Ronin, hired by Natascha McElhone (Dierdre) by The Man in the Wheelchair (An Homage to another spy thing, I'm sure, there are always guys in wheelchairs) to recover an aluminum box. Ronin - A Samurai with No Master who hires out as a thief or Mercenary. This film focuses on the Ronin(s) played by DeNiro and Reno and their variegated talents and abilities, mostly the ability to keep adapting to new situations.Nobody ever tells us what is in the box or what it's for, just that Thieves and Spies are lining up dead to get it. And so these five Ronin develop a plan to retrieve said box. As with any spy\/heist flick there is a doublecross, a doublecross on the doublecross, and then there is a period of revenge. Nuff Said about that, I'm not gonna give any details Watch the film.In the traditional Japanese stories, the Ronin always perform Seppaku after their Revenge is acquired. But DeNiro (Sam) does not agree with the traditional Japanese ending of the tale, he calls the 47 Ronin stupid, in his POV they are idiots. He spends the rest of the film proving it. Mostly he proves it to fellow Ronin Jean Reno (Vincent).This film has more twists and turns than the Matterhorn or Space Mountain at Disneyland\/World (Or, Mister Toad's Wild Ride)... I enjoyed the plain unpredictable story, at no time was I able to guess future events in the story, as with most Frankenheimer films. There is a car chase through the South of France that rivals any James Bond or Jason Bourne car chase.This fresh story was a marriage of traditional and new-wave spy stories, and I'm sure the characters of Jason Bourne and the new Daniel Craig 007 took some things from this film. This film uses the whole culmination of Frankeinheimer's extensive talents as director, using techniques he's even pioneered, with ultimate polish. This is decisively one of his best works. I double... Triple and Quadruple-Dare Liman, Caton-Jones, Woo, and Ang Lee to surpass this film.The Music is perfect and fitting written by Elia Cmiral who mostly works on Modern B-Monster movies, uses a haunting Celtic melody, which could be either Scottish or Japanese, and mixes it with Modern Jazz rhythms- The soundtrack is the second best thing about the film. What is missing and not missed, is the modern tendency to hire one modern Rock Band to play the Theme Song of the film, like Moby's work in the Bourne moovies (Although I like Moby's work) - Or, the James Bond Themes done by whatever Rock Band is a top-10 artist at the time of release. Musicians and Artists scrabble for Movie rights, and this film uses no Bands or Artists. Jivan Gasparyan plays the movie theme on a Duduk and Cmiral orchestrates around this simple erie melody. In this respect, makes the soundtrack for the film superior - There is nothing I hate more, after seeing a great flick, and then the feeling is ruined by inappropriate top-10 songs shoved over the end credits (Except for the use of Black Sabbath's Iron Man in the movie of the same name).Someone appropriately said of this film Great action movie, Hollywood should watch and learn from this - I wholly agree.

It was a one of a kind film experience, one that has remained an undeniable classic for some time. Though elements of film noir have been duplicated from time to time in modern films, such as Sin City and the animated film Batman Mask of the Phantasm, the original films are simply a band apart. Film noir most specifically represented a time of change in American history. At a time when World War II was awakening people to the horrors men were capable of, and the perfect picture was that of that of the suburban family, film noir was almost a shadow cast by those things. The genre was an exposure of the blackness of the human soul. Housewives and insurance salesman, ordinary people that committed heinous crimes for the hunger of sex and money, not uncommonly both. Not to mention due to the censorship code being in full effect, the writers and filmmakers had to be subtle about their subject, and what it lead to was sharp characterization that didn't use just words. All of these aspects come together to form the mise en scene of Double Indemnity.Consider the cast Fred MacMurray as Walter Neff was a promising choice from the start. After all, prior to this role MacMurray had done light-hearted comedies, and the same went for after the role. The character of Walter Neff was obviously a lot darker than anything he'd portrayed before in his career, and to audiences it must of seemed very cold and unfamiliar to see him play the part as well as he did. The audience first meets MacMurray's character Neff as a confident and cool salesman, completely in control of his little world, till that is he meets the character of Phyllis Dietrichson, played by the luscious Barbara Stanwyck.Stanwyck is the temptress, a model example of the film noir femme fatale. Of course one of the fundamental key components of the film is the relationship between Stanwyck's character and MacMurray's. Right when they first meet, a low angle shot reveals to him a smooth-skinned angel, eyes glistening and all. We see him on the other hand from a low angle, before anyone even realizing that the cinematography is establishing the nature of their relations. The femme fatale was many things, a seductress, a siren, but to be more exact one might say bluntly a wolf in sheep's clothing.Edward G. Robinson is more of a character actor this time around, playing Robert Keyes. He is not only a friend of Neff, but he is the incorruptible 'detective' of the film. Even though he's just a claims man, it is made evidently clear he's somewhat of a protagonist. I use the word somewhat because throughout the film he inadvertently puts heat on MacMurray, saying A claims man is a surgeon. That desk is an operating table, and the pencils are scalpels and bone chisels. It is subtly symbolized that the occupation is a breeding ground of human treachery, for when Keyes refers to the claims themselves that he receives every day, he remarks they're packed with drama; with twisted hopes and crooked dreams. Another powerful film noir component is the nature of the story. While ach one obviously varies, at the root of all film noir is the temptation of money and so-called love, full of people who will literally kill for those things. The nature of the screenplay captures the dark side of the human nature perfectly. Notice how Barbara Stanwyck creates the mood of vulnerability, using it to deceive Walter. He at first seems to be weary, but he shot of their first kiss already sets up his inability to resist. The low key lighting helps to enhance this dark mood. Foolish Walter eventually does take the vile deed upon himself to orchestrate, and composer Miklós Rózsa adds a dark cue as he takes on the sinful task.The consistent hard lightning returns as Neff walks down the street, and tells the audience It was the walk of a dead man. The film opens up with his character confessing, so already it is known who has committed the crime, and yet as the climax draws closer more and more of the plan begins to fall thru, and one can feel a sense of disaster ahead.A combination of hard and low-key lightning adds greatly to the film, all of it used to heighten the character's emotions. Coupled with MacMurray's cynical narration, the effect is quite devastating. Remember the brightly lit outdoors of the peaceful suburb neighborhood in the opening scenes, where we even see innocent children running and playing. Once Walter enters the house, however, he finds himself in a gloomy otherworld, one from which he will not be able to escape. The ever present Venetians blinds cast prison bars on Walter in many scenes. This fusion of lightning and subtle symmetry set up the doomed aura surrounding Walter.Note the tight framing at first with the two 'lovers', but by half-way thru the film much looser framing is used as the two's trust diminishes with every exposed lie. It is in their final moments together the spacing becomes tighter for one last moment of intimacy. The final scene between the two is both a landmark for its music, or lack there of, and its visuals. There in that near blackness we see the glimmer of a gun. When the music stops as the curtains are shut, the only source of light in the room now gone, we hear the crack of the first gun shot.Double Indemnity is a classic by all means, the genesis of film noir.

I mean, You've got the boys piggishly chanting Debbie does Greek! and a poodle named Boner, right next to some of the worst movie violence ever seen, and I don't think they at all got the balance right-this didn't strike me as a type of movie that should have had any humour in it at all. And the bit when the old lady gets hit with the beer bottle has got to be the cheapest laugh ever committed to celluloid! I felt that the pace was very straightforward and kinda dull, but then it would flare up, if you will, when the violent murders happened, then go back to being average. Accept at the end. After the final murder the film thankfully has an energy that carries it straight to the end. The movie's got a couple of really corny but funny lines, my favourite one is when a gal yells at the boys to eat her f**k! What the hell was that?! Awesome! Charlie Sheen. Too cool for school.

I can't believe I used to think he looked cute! He looks and acts like the arrogant Hollywood brat I'm sure he was at that point. He had none of the presence that Caulfield did. I think that it would have been a very different and far better movie had someone else played Bo. Someone who wasn't Charlie Sheen. Because I feel that Chuck brought the movie down big time. In fact, for me he almost totally ruins it. The movie would have worked better if Chuckers had done a better job of appearing more shocked and traumatised by the killings.

There's an impressive intro sequence, with images of serial killers, and parts of speeches from serial killers, but I'm not sure if it's really them. It's kind of misleading, as it gives the impression that the movie is going to be one as shocking as, say, Henry Portrait Of A Serial Killer. And although it is indeed shocking and violent, it comes nowhere near the bleak nightmarishness of that great film. To me the most sickening bit in the movie is when the poor hippie chick gets shaken to death for absolutely nothing. Truly horrific. I thought Maxwell Caulfield was brilliant as the deceptively handsome, blue-eyed mass murdering thug Roy. He's really terrifying as a brawny bully stuck in a rut. There's not much you can say about the character really. He's big, he's mean, he's bitter, he's twisted. That's about it. Always scowling, always trying to bring anything bigger than himself down to his level. There's nothing sympathetic about him. There's a creepy scene early on where he is eyeing a couple at a party with this evil cold glint in his eye. Again, all the more frightening because it's coming from a pair of strikingly beautiful blue eyes. There are two little scenes that are supposed to give insight into his bleak world. One is where it shows Roy's home, the other is way later when he tries miserably to read. They both felt a bit quick and stuck in there to me, but they are both really funny though. I believe that when he gets shot down like the mad dog he is, that just maybe, that was what he really wanted...Despite how brutal and foul Roy is, he's the dark heart and soul of this movie. Imagine if someone as bad as Sheen was had played Roy. Not a pretty picture. Very violent to say it was directed by a woman. Not to say women can't make violent movies,(why would they want to?) but I was surprised that a lady directed this one in particular. But reading about some of the things that have happened in the life of the director, I could see where the movie's dark intensity could have come from. Penelope Spheeris herself is shocked by the film, saying that she would never make such a violent picture today. I think they were trying to make a movie with some great social commentary about young killers, but for me when it's over it really feels like it just fails in that way.

I viewed this film for a history of cinema class, and i have to admit that while I am certainly a fan of horror movies, I did not initially think that this film would be that good. I was clearly wrong. Karloff truly does play a good monster, albeit a monster with a good heart that is continuously misunderstood. But nonetheless, the performance is both captivating and a bit eerie. it is odd to think that the tale of Dr. Frankenstein and his monster has been around for almost two centuries, since Mary Shelley first published her novel in 1817. That being said, after viewing this film, it is clear why this story or tale has had such seemingly endless staying power with generations of viewers. This film touches on several key ideas that I believe must people can relate to the feeling of wanting to be GOD, or more correctly, to have total control of life and death, as well as the notion that sometimes once something has been done, it can not be undone. The latter idea is really what keeps the film going, as at anytime the good doctor could have simply put his horrid creation out to pasture, so to speak. But he can not, which further reinforces my point that some things are so deplorable and vile that once they are done, they are done forever. Secondly, this idea is again recognized in the fact that the monster does not die at the end of the movie, and obviously for Hollywood's monetary purposes this makes sense, but it just goes to strengthen my point. On the former point that I made earlier, in an often anarchistic, and at times lawless world, who would not want to be in control? I think that is one of the key things that resonates with viewers. But I digress; everything about the film was top notch. Often when viewing older films, I am left with a sense of wanting, or I wished that more could have happened. however, with this film, I was left with no such feeling. The movie runs smoothly, with bits of really funny material from Henry's father that help to detract from the overall seriousness of the picture, and the cast is obviously first rate. Additionally, the overall feel of the picture is extremely well done. The camera does not to be intruding upon performances when doing close ups, and the scenery, music ( or lack of), and minute details all help complete a truly great viewing experience. This is especially so in the scene where Maria's father carries her limp body through the village, and the camera pans to all the womens faces in their respective windows as the pop out to see what all the commotion is about. As the camera goes from face to face it helps to give the viewer the feeling that he or she could really be apart of this small village and the tragedy that has befallen it.

However, Titanic (1953) is a bit different because it really doesn't focus on WHY the disaster occurred but instead focused on one particular fictional family and how this horrible tragedy impacted on them. This is NOT at all a complaint--just an observation on the style of film this is.The Sturges family is very wealthy--but they also are a mess. The mother (Barbara Stanwyck) is unhappy about her sterile rich life and its impact on her children. Her marriage is loveless and her daughter, in particular, has become spoiled and somewhat soul-less. So, without telling her two children, she is embarking with to a new life in America--back where she grew up with simpler values. The husband (Clifton Webb) apparently has just learned of her plan to leave him and he desperately works to get aboard the sold out ship. He is determined to bring his kids back to Europe and make them American royalty.When Webb and Stanwyck eventually meet up on the ship, she announces that she is leaving him. She doesn't love him and, in a final slap in his face, tells Webb that his son is NOT his biological son but another man's! At this point, Webb becomes VERY cold towards his wife--which is understandable.

Not even looking in a mirror but I don't dare finish the phrase. I can see my reflection in the computer screen. Maybe that counts, I don't know. No hook so far, I'm safe.Most of you will be thinking that this film will be typical. Looking back at it now, from the teens to the nineties you will be thinking another typical Nightmare On Elm Street or Friday the 13th that will be remade very shortly as a Hollywood slasher flick. I have to say on first impression of this film, this was not the case.The first forty minutes follow Helen (Madsen), a student researching for her thesis on urban horror. To accompany her on her project is her best friend Bernadette (Lemmons), who unwittingly helps Helen delve deep into the theories behind one of the great legends, that of the 'Candyman.' Say his name five times and he'll cut you with his hook of a hand. They interview people from a rundown council estate, a place where a while back a girl was murdered after stating Candyman's name five times into the mirror. Her body was then sliced open from groin to gullet. The residents believe it has some mystic reason but Helen just shrugs it off and researches the building without any care. She finds, hidden away behind the mirror a secret lair, which has signs of life to it. Intrigued by this she goes in taking photos. Photos she believes will help her ace her project. Bernadette on the other hand is more interested in their safety.Helen gets rid of the shackle that is Bernadette and continues her research alone but comes unstuck when she meets 'Candyman' himself. A leader of the local gang who uses a hook to hurt people. She is attacked but not killed and then helps the police in capturing this man.Up to this point the film is good and I was pleasantly surprised at how much I was enjoying it. No silly teen girl doing things out of the ordinary, no shoddy acting to match the dreadful script. As a matter of fact the acting and script were pretty good. There is also believable reason as to why Helen pursues her interest alone. An untrustworthy husband and a desire to achieve greatness.I'm afraid after here though the film takes a huge dive. For starters the Candyman is finally introduced, the spirit of a slave who had his hand sawn off, his body smothered in honey to attract deadly bees and burnt on a fire, and that is the problem from there. He was much more believable when he wasn't seen. People say they thought Todd was excellent as the Candyman but I just found the whole role lame. The film had real potential up until we finally see him, standing like he has a rod up his arse in a parking garage. From there we see him hypnotize Helen into murdering the next load of victims and being arrested for it. Causing her to drop her obsession with the case and instead be an object of Candyman's desires.I won't tell you too much more as it may ruin a film many horror fans will love, I'm just a little disappointed that a film that started off so well ended so poorly. Madsen is brilliant in her role and takes the useless female actor cliché away from the horror franchise, well at least from this film anyway, and the score is intensely creepy although there is only so much organ playing I can take. Also many of the tracking shots giving you the sense that someone is watching you are great. It's just an absolute shame this film took a dive as it could have been something a hell of a lot better.

Because of this, I was somewhat familiar with the story and remember disliking it. However, it seems that this was because instead of watching the play being performed or watching this movie (that was adapted by Wilder for the screen), my class in middle school read the play--the worst possible way to understand and appreciate it. Now, 35 years later, I finally got around to seeing it like it should be seen--and I am glad I did.This is an interesting play because of its cast. In addition to a lot of familiar supporting actors such as Guy Kibbee, Fay Bainter, Beulah Bondi, Thomas Mitchell and Frank Craven (who assisted Wilder with the screenplay), the film marks the debut of Martha Scott and William Holden. I really appreciate how many of the actors are the same folks who starred in the Broadway play and how the studio let Wilder keep control of his script--this, unfortunately, is pretty rare. Too often, a studio buys a play and then completely changes it--showing utter contempt for the actors and playwright.As far as the story goes, it's quite peculiar in style. The closest film I can think of like this is the film version of Eugene O'Neill's Strange Interlude--but the O'Neill play didn't really work well on screen. Both featured characters speaking their thoughts out loud to the audience--an unusual innovation to say the least. Another innovation in Our Town is having the character of the Mr. Morgan (Craven) also acting as the narrator. Because of this unusual style and the leisurely pace of the film, it's one that might lose viewers who don't have the patience to stick with this one. Don't give up--especially when the film gets depressing--it's a delight and the payoff is definitely worth the long wait.Impressively written, full of wonderful performances and expertly directed, this one is well worth seeing.

The film includes cameos from Steve Martin, Richard Pryor, Bob Hope, Edgar Bergen(this is also his last film role),Elliot Gould, Big Bird played by Carrol Spinney and many more. The Muppet Movie is the first movie in a long time that has left me with a good feeling and a smile on my face. I definitely recommend The Muppet Movie.Rated G.1hr 35min\/95min.****\/**** ","genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family"},{"date":"29 September 2011","score":"","review":" The movie even though old and short didn't seem dated at all. The camera work through the village of the father carrying the girl was shot well in one continuous scene. The wedding and marriage wasn't really necessary but it distracted and took some moments away from the up coming raids or tragedy. When in the windmill at the end I felt sad for the monster because even though he was truly a monster he was doing everything out of not knowing any better since he was created by man. It was a good first horror movie to watch and looking forward to watching my second one. I would recommend that any horror film lovers start watching the old ones first and then the remakes, because I haven't seen any of the remakes but am now going to keep my eyes open and find them to see how different or similar they are to each other.

This is a cult film by now, especially in heavy metal circles. It's a better kind of fun, being able to laugh at yourself or how you viewed the world at one point.These people feel they matter, even though the music is mid-tempo chugging such as as was dime a dozen in 80's metal, the lyrics dumb - here deliberately over-the-top - but passing themselves as commentary, and the fans feel they matter; but we know they don't.The mockumentary tropes have been copied everywhere since, but they still work better than most here. They key is this godsend gift of the British; balance between where the joke begins and where the rest of the surrounding world is polite enough to let unfold.There is no scatological confrontation such as we find in Hollywood; everything is offered and accepted - jokes about vomit, sexism, dead drummers - with a kind of stoic grace. These people are brainless but endearing.This is why the wrap-around is so marvelous and has endured so well. We get a film that taps into the lives of people who feel they have tapped into the lives of people, who perceive themselves at the center of the world yet are continuously baffled to realize they revolve in some obscure periphery and no one cares. Their song about Stonehenge, full of dumb self-important musings about druids and ancient mystery, is confounded by a tiny Stonehenge prop; the ridicule literally descends on stage from above, the laughter here divine.It is a loving - never fully cynical, cold, mocking - affect though, that we may recognize from our own small efforts to matter in the grand scheme.

Jaws is adapted from Peter Benchley's suspenseful novel of the same name, and it tells the story of a great white shark searching for innocent prey on Amity Island, and it's up to the Chief of Police, a fisherman, and a oceanographer to help catch and kill the shark. Jaws is truly one of the many cinema masterpieces, and it's also one of the most thrilling movies ever to scare the life out of you. Steven Spielberg delivers an astounding job of directing such a suspenseful feature, besides all the trouble, or living hell, that has been caused on set while filming. The cast is pure genius, and it's filled with such talented actors. The late great Roy Scheider brings a golden performance as Chief of Police Martin Brody, Robert Shaw delivers fine acting as Quint, the shark-killing fisherman, Richard Dreyfuss portrays an incredible performance as Matt Hooper, the oceanographer, and Murray Hamilton does a great job playing the mayor of Amity. Also, John William's fantastic score helped set the suspense, and it helped raise the tension. Bill Butler's astounding cinematography, Robert Mattey's incredible shark effects, Verna Fields' groundbreaking film editing, Ron and Valerie Taylor's astonishing shark footage, and the excellent use of sound helped create the world of Jaws, and it brings a lot of art and hard work to the picture. Jaws is a spectacle of thrill and horror, and it never makes you back into the water. Trust me, I really can't go back in the water anymore.

Too artificial for me. That accusation could be levelled at just about any Sci Fi film of course, but we're all different! A year or so ago I told myself to watch some musicals to see if I could love them (at the age of 47!), and have since seen Cabaret (loved it), the Sound of Music (very good) and Singin' In The Rain (fantastic), so hopes were high for WSS. It gets off to a belting start with the mysterious graphic (what is it?!!) and has some great moments. The photography and sets are first class, some of the music & dance scenes have terrific energy and vibrance. For a film of its time it is a great period piece and tells us of the emergence of rebellious youth who don't anymore quake in their boots when the police arrive on the scene. So, why the 5 stars? For me there are just too many songs. The 3 musicals mentioned above felt like a film with a few songs; WSS felt like song & dance with a film tacked on the side. As the titles rolled, my Mrs said What a sad ending but I hadn't felt it at all. I'd seen Everybody's Fine the night before and that is sad towards the end, but not this. The reason is that apart from Natalie Wood's character I just couldn't relate to any of the characters as they felt so artificial to me. Anybody that breaks into song in even the most traumatic of situations feels remote to me, so much so that I couldn't really care what became of them. Anyway, WSS gets a score of 7.7 on IMDb (at time of writing in Sept '11) so I'm clearly in the minority! I'm glad I've seen it & I can imagine for the musical lover it is a must-see. For me I've seen it, glad I've ticked it off but won't watch it again.
