Religion, be it Christianity,Hinduism,Islam........ is based on a 'story' from a 'sacred holy story book' that portrays a human(s) who despite all obstacles emerges finally to save the world, by sacrificing himself for the sole purpose of annihilating the evil.All success stories no matter how big or small, are always at the basic level a fight against temptation. A successful athlete fights effectively the temptation to take it easy and relax, a good student fights the temptation to sleep early in exam days, a honest police officer fights the temptation of accepting a bribe&#133;.and so on. Success in life and defeating temptation are two sides of the same coin.Now Scorsese's movie (this one the closest to his heart) is conveying just that. The Jesus in this story is completely unsure of himself, in fact he is weak, he needs Judas to protect him, hold him. He, just like all of us wants to lead a normal life, get married and have kids, and why shouldn't he?? But no, he must not, he cannot, because that would come in the way of god's plan. So does he just tell his heart, 'Look, don't tempt me to live that life, I am born for a different purpose', and the heart would say 'All right, I'm sorry I didn't realize that, 'click' there, I turned off the temptation switch, it wont bother u any more' We all know its not that simple, temptations are a part of human life, thats what makes us who we are. So the movie portrays beautifully, the constant inner voice of Jesus asking god 'Why me??, don't I deserve a normal life??'. Finally he fights all the temptations and is crucified, but when he feels the monstrous pain of the nails biting through his bones through the wood, the mortal human side of him resurrects, and is again over come with the desire to say 'hell with it, I don't care ,I'm outta here'.***Spoiler**** And thats when the often misunderstood and controversial portion of the movie begins. The lord of temptations 'satan' deceives him into accepting the life he wanted, he gets married to Mary Magdalene, has children, grows old and is about to die an old man, when he is confronted with the truth that all this was a sham.He asks for forgiveness from the almighty and is granted just that.....and 'bam' he is back on the cross........elated to find all that just happened was just his whole alternate strayed life compressed into an ephemeral moment, the whole package designed by god to convince him that this is the righteous path....the solution to his life's conundrum, the end of all miseries.The problem is that we aren't as fortunate, we don't have the luxury of living the whole life and then begging god to put us back to the place where we succumbed to temptation. So the beautiful moral of this story is that to succeed in life, you gotta overcome the temptations of daily life that hinder your progress.I find this the most powerful portrayal of Jesus Christ in any movie. Most of the previous movies, show him as born a god, so he doesn't have to fight any temptations, he just has to get crucified. I say 'What's the big deal in that??, If I was god I could do that too.' But no I'm not one, fighting the temptations in spite being a human might bring me closer to one though. Will make me realize my dreams. Make me successful. Reach my final goal. Just how the real Jesus must have done it. And that's why this movie is so special. It approaches the subject of Jesus's personality from a different and more plausible perspective.

The father, unsure of how to explain to Ponette that her mom is in fact, not coming back, and unable to convince her that the visions she keeps having of her mother being around every now and then, he sends her away for a while to live with friends and to cope with her loss as best as the adults and young friends around her can help her do.Victoire Thivisol, as the young Ponette, does a great job. I hadn't thought about it before that, as another view points out, this was not the fake sorrow of an actress with glycerine tears and such, all of the performance was real. And, although the story is interesting in that you see how a young kid might actually react to the death of someone they know and love, and how others might help them to cope with that, I was annoyed that about three quarters of the movie was Ponette crying over one thing or another. I suppose this is quite unsympathetic on my part to think that, damn, this kid is crying again? In all, I say that this film is for an audience that particularly enjoys its emotional dramas. Ponette has a lot to offer there. For others, the story may become either repetitive or just altogether dull to sit through, as at least one viewer has already expressed.

I'd heard good things about it and knew that it had been nominated for several Oscars, winning one for best adapted screenplay. I saw Monster's Ball last week and was so impressed with Billy Bob Thornton's performance that I decided to catch up on a film I'd missed.It might be that I saw it too late, ten years after its release, after seeing Thornton in more sophisticated roles. More to the point, after hearing his witty commentary on Monster's Ball. It was difficult to find him believable in the part of Karl.I very much enjoyed the performances of Lucas Black as Frank, the young boy Karl befriends, and of James Hampton as Dr. Jerry Woolridge at the state hospital; also the brief cameo of Robert Duvall. Theirs were the best performances in the film. Natalie Canerday playing the boy's mother, Dwight Yoakum playing her boyfriend, and Rick Dial as Karl's boss, were stilted, as if playing their first roles. The camera angles didn't help, they worked against the story rather than enhancing it. Both problems are most likely the result of Thornton directing his first film.I realized what was going to happen about halfway through the film, and from then on it didn't hold my attention as I waited for the inevitable to happen.I think what surprises me most, considering the Oscar awarded, is that the dialogue and characterizations didn't ring true. Karl would say something in a manner too sophisticated for his character. Not so much the language he used as the thought structure behind the language -- he'd have to be a different person to say what he says.Toward the end of the film, Thornton the screenwriter took shortcuts, having Karl say exactly what the audience needed to hear in order to understand the story, without the screenwriter's usual cloaking in the reality of how the character would actually say it. John Ritter playing a gay store manager wasn't given enough original dialogue to avoid a stereotype. (And his haircut was ridiculous.) At times I saw Billy Bob looking out through Karl's eyes; the most striking example was his conversation with Vaughn about having Linda over to stay the night. Most of Thornton's performance boiled down to his manner of speaking, his choice of clothes and physical stance.In a number of scenes, he was moving more quickly than Karl would, as for example when he's packing up to leave the garage behind the Wheatley house. He lifts his mattress and pulls out a pile of cash, lets the mattress fall and immediately straightens the bedclothes. How, or perhaps why, could someone considered slow straighten the blankets that quickly? And someone who grew up living in a shed, sleeping in an indentation in the dirt? Karl was moving at Thornton's speed, not his own.

I was too young to see it in its original theatrical release, and first became exposed to it when it finally made it to broadcast TV in the the later '60 s. Even on the small screen and with commercials, it still had the ability to fascinate a 10 year old who saw it for the first time. Then it seemed to disappear until the late 1980's when I saw it again on a (defective) laser disc and finally in the 1990's on cable.I purchased the recently released DVD just this week. From the first shot of the MGM logo in brilliant color, and the glorious opening music of Russell Garcia swelling from the speakers of my home theater system, I experienced the thrill that people must have felt when the movie was first shown in theaters. The colors are vibrant and the movie has been restored to crystal clarity. Finally, you can see every detail of George's Victorian living room. At last we can read Mfg. by H.G. Wells on the time machine's console. Unlike the truncated picture version seen on TV, this widescreen DVD shows parts of the movie that haven't been seen in years (example when Philby points to the sky and says atomic satellite zeroing in you can finally SEE what he is pointing to).However for me the biggest treat on the DVD is a wonderful documentary about the Time Machine narrated by Rod Taylor. I think the documentary was made in the early 1990's for Turner Classic Movies. You can see that Taylor has very fond memories of making the film (stating that at the end of production that everyone connected with the film had the feeling that they had just made a classic movie). He also has great personal praise for George Pal, at one point doing a remarkable imitation of Pal's Hungarian accent! Thoroughly fascinating is the story of how the design of Time Machine itself was conceived, and it's subsequent history after the movie. Wah Chang and Gene Warren give a great exposition of how the special effects were done. Another little gem in the documentary is Rod Taylor reading a selection from H.G. Wells'original story. But the piece de la resistance comes towards the end. Whit Bissel shows up reprising his role in the movie, and--especially--there is a touching and wonderfully done reunion between Alan Young (as Philby) and Taylor set 25 years after the events of the movie. The script for this scene was written by none other than David Duncan himself, who wrote the script for the movie. This scene brought a tear to the eye and a lump in the throat of this hardened movie goer, I can tell you! I would recommend this DVD to all fans of great science fiction movies, and as an example of a time when these types of movies still made some demand on the intellect of the viewer--unlike the violent and CGI effects-laden popcorn for the mind that current sci-fi movies are (including the recent remake of this movie). The original Time Machine, compared to today's sci-fi movies, proves that the most elaborate computer-generated effects, gory violence, ear-splitting explosions, and MTV-style editing---cannot replace a good and challenging story.

But the cast of this film intrigued me a great deal and I love 80's Brat Pack films so I had to check it out. What a gripping, very real, look at cliques and emotion and young people living on the edge. Veteran film maker Francis Ford Coppola puts together a gritty, emotional ride revolving around two very different groups of young people, Greasers and Socs (pronounced Soashes). The best part of the film is that any one person can relate to at least one of the character from either side of the group. It examines the relations between two different cliques which everyone experiences in life but especially younger people in school and such.The lead is played by C. Thomas Howell back when he could apparently actually act and before his career went completely toilet side. I can say without any hesitation this is his best performance. He does a terrific job as Ponyboy Curtis. His parents have died and his oldest brother is doing the very best he can to raise him and give the opportunities and future that he or their other brother never had. Howell is just the essential, normal, troubled kid that so many could relate to. He suffers through learning to deal with the loss of his parents, his best friend in the whole world and the people he knows around him. Determined to find his place in the world he shows some of his tougher skinned friends that the world is a beautiful place even in the shadow of bad things happening. Ralph Macchio plays his best friend Johnny Cade. Macchio also does an incredible job of playing the troubled teen whose parents are alcoholic abusers who barely notice him. His emotion and tears touch you every time and his death is heart breaking. Macchio who of course is best known as The Karate Kid gives his best performance in The Outsiders as well. Patrick Swayze, in his rather small role, as older brother\/father figure to Ponyboy and the other kids in the neighborhood does a good job with what is given to him. You certainly get a feel for his struggle and his tough time dealing with the loss of his parents and you get a hint in the story of what he lost out on to take care of his brothers. He struggled to hold onto them no matter what. Despite these performances being good no one holds a flame to what actor Matt Dillon pulls off in this film as bad ass Dallas Winston (Dally.) An ex-con who is only still young, but is hardened by crime and life on the streets. He still pulls out all the stops to protect his friends when one of them (Johnny Cade) kills a Soc. defending Ponyboy. Dillon's emotions and performance absolutely moves you in such a powerful way. He's a commanding presence and never having been a huge Dillon fan he won me over easily in this performance. Now I understand where his fame was based this being one of his earliest films. The supporting cast is made up of young up and comers who did ended up making themselves into real names....Tom Cruise (one of his first roles), Rob Lowe, Emilio Estevez, Diane Lane, and crooner Leif Garrett as the leader of the Socs. They all have rather small roles not really giving them the opportunity to flex any real acting ability but they certainly add to the cast in a great way. Each one of them create a unique character in the small roles they are given.The Outsiders is a brilliant coming of age movie set in the sixties to the perfect (if not overtly predictable) soundtrack. The film, although geared towards teens is a violent look at hatred and stereotyping that ends up in the loss of dear friends. The climax of the film is the brutal fist fight battle between the Socs and the Greasers which although violent is a victory for the constantly harassed lower classes of the film, the underdogs so to speak. Coppola brilliantly created this world around them and in essence created a classic film that classrooms and people will watch for years to come. If you love eighties films or even just a real powerful drama The Outsiders is worth seeing. If for no other reason than it's fun to see all the big names in their youngest days. 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"12 March 2006","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" I am ashamed to say as a fan of literature that I have not read the novel.

The script and screenplay were terrible, focusing on pointless minutiae, skipping over the actual EVENTS of the story. The plot seemed to whizz along at lightning pace, yet nothing was happening. And the acting! The lines were delivered as if extracted through elaborate torture. I fell asleep in between the multiple, irrelevant and badly executed 'dramatic pauses' that Mr. Hofmund (Tootsir) laid thickly on. There are some very fine performances. Robin William (Mork the Ork)is a delight as the decent middle-aged slightly-unworldly cleric with a paunch pitch-forked into conflict with the never-never world when all he wants to do is forget the nightmares of his youth. Dame Maggie Smith is in good form as his splenetic and ambitious mother-in-law Grandam Wendy, and Bob Hoskins as slimy as only he can be as a politicking chaplain. Add the world's wimpiest Bishop, a frighteningly domineering Bishop's wife, and the entertaining yet mercifully brief appearance put in by pop veteran Phil Collins and we have an excellent cast. There is one scene in particular, which shows him grabbing Dustin's backside, which is completely out of character for him, and anyway Cap'n Hookie would have bitten his head off if he'd tried anything like that with him in real life, as he was always (despite anything else that can be said about him) very conscious of his dignity, as he was also...I suppose the filmmaker needed to dramatize what a selfish, self-centered person Hook was, but the characterization given to him in this screenplay is just not accurate & for me, it stuck out like a sore thumb. Just showing Beer-bellied Robins as the weak, stubborn, manipulated man he was, would have been enough -- the screenplay made him downright sleazy which I don't think is a fault you can put down to the Duke of Windsor, tho' he had many others!

Val Kilmar looks like him and even sounds like him. Val could have been a rocker!!! Great movie!!!

But this one is without doubt The One which comes to mind for me as the quintessential Wild West movie. I particularly enjoyed the beginning and end as they tie the movie together very well and leave the viewer wondering whether or not it is all fact or fiction. No doubt, just as in many retellings of history... there's a good mixture of both.Billy the Kid's role is convincingly played to the hilt by Estevez, who manages to be both frivolous and serious at the same time. The Kid is more than just handy with a gun and knows it. So he carries a huge ego and a wicked sense of humor that can turn deadly in a heartbeat. He is really just a naive, rebellious teenager - but with easy access to firearms and of course he has no respect for societal norms, including the law! I can't think of anyone else playing this role as credibly, so kudos to whomever was responsible for the casting.There's an impressive cast - many of whom were just appearing on the acting horizon when this film was made. Not one of them puts in a lackluster performance, but Billy steals the show. Highly Recommended viewing. Even for those who don't usually watch Westerns.

Love this film, great ensemble cast, its hard to pick a favourite character or performance. Ben Affleck gives arguably his best ever performance as the guy you love to hate, the school bully who just loves beating up little kids. Matthew McConaughey exudes Steve McQueen-esquire cool as Wooderson, the slightly older guy who has two loves in life, his car, and high school chicks! The story is a freewheeling affair, basically following the last day of term in an unnamed US school in 1976. The main character Randall 'Pink' Floyd is at a crossroads in life. Does he quite literally play ball as the star quarterback, follow orders and continue to live as high school royalty, or does he follow his more rebellious friends, for parties, beer and good times?!! The great trick with any retrospective film is to make you nostalgic for an age you weren't born in, and this film achieves this with style. Its amazing just how much young talent was on display in this film, Affleck, McConaughey, Parker Posey, Milla Jovovich, Jason London & Joey Lauren Adams to name just a few! Yet its Rory Cochrane who steals the film as a spaced-out stoner. If you haven't seen this film before, go and rent\/buy it. If you have seen it before, watch it again!

This movie is a hagiography...a worshipful or idealizing biography. Sir Richard picked his scenes well off the storyboard of Mahatma Gandhi's life. He tried to build up a life history treading two tracks..non-violence and India's freedom struggle. Otherwise, he left out many important facts that could be found given prominence in the man's autobiography. Plus, the short comings of the man were not dealt with.Sir Richard knew too well to leave out the minuses. I give him full marks for his deliberate attempt at hagiography. He is a master story teller...not a critic. Storytellers tell stories that catch your attention from once upon a time... to thus ends the tale. He used his people well...he would want none less than Nana Palsikar (a revered Indian actor from the yester-years) to play a minuscule but moving role of an old farmer dying of hunger. He created a gripping short story out of the intense Om Puri and his little role. Sir Richard packed too many people into the movie without losing the grip, the story or the simplicity. So much that each time I watch the movie (23 times so far!), I find someone I know whom I had not seen on the movie before.There is one important tool to visual story-telling...editing. This movie is a text book on movie-editing. The one reason I watch it again and again is because of this. The editor (John Bloom) deserves the Oscar. He made the story simple and dramatic at the same time. Sir Richard used symbolism to the best to narrate the movie. He creates the impact at the beginning itself, with Bloom snipping the film at the right moments. Gandhi's assassination in 3 short scenes and the abrupt break to a massive funeral that starts off with the slow-steps of soldiers accompanying the mortal remains of Gandhi on his final journey. It's dramatic and raises your anticipation. Cut to South Africa...the train and you know, the story is unwinding to tell you why that man shot the old man. That is storytelling.How do you narrate the passing of time and with it the increased popularity of a man in a movie? The scene where Gandhi arrives at Champaran. The soldier tells the police officer...He is coming! (Not exactly, but something similar). No name...no elaborate words to explain who is coming and what his story is. Just these few words and the movie positions Gandhi. Again...story telling.Another symbolism...the scene where Gandhi meets the Viceroy at the Viceregal House (now the Presidential Palace in India). Just one car with a motor cycle outrider that deposits its sole passenger who ascends the wide steps all alone, in a slow and poised gait, head slightly bowed. There is no one else save for two guards who stand to attention as the man in simple loin cloth and a wrap nears the final step. The scene lasts 20 seconds. It depicts the ascendancy of a simple man...yet another master piece from the movie. A scene with its own short story...Critics and analysts may go and watch something else. This is a movie for those who grew up reading stories and have not got over it. No wonder this movie has its immense following.

Follow his eyes especially when Jinnah is around...looks of a cunning fox that measures up the lion against the tiger and takes sides accordingly. If I fast I die, if you fast, we will take all sorts of trouble to keep you alive.Also Check out Nehru's role too...how the selfishness takes over...especially towards the end.

The noise and visuals were so electric that I enjoyed this film immensely. My only regret about the experience was that I didn't get a chance to redeem the Free Pepsi with purchase of large popcorndiscount coupons they were giving out that day!In a pleasant,average California suburb,ordinary teenager MArty McFly(Michael J.Fox,who was a youngish 24 when he filmed this) dreams of being a rock guitarist as he works his way through school,helping out brilliant-but-fringe local scientist Dr.Emmitt Brown(Christopher Lloyd,adding to his wide range of characters). When an unforeseen crisis interrupts Doc Brown's breakthrough time-machine revelation,MArty is thrust into the machine and becomes the unwitting first participant in time-travel. As if that weren't harrowing enough,he's just found a way to break up his younger parents BEFORE they met and now he has to feverishly find some way to get them back together,lest he and his sibs will never be born.If you can suspend some level of disbelief while watching this(and,really,when SHOULDN'T you suspend some disbelief when watching Spielberg\/Lucas\/Zemekis style of sci-fi films?),this film is as smooth as silk and one fun ride! Besides Fox and Lloyd,Crispin Glover(lovably strange and pathetic as Marty's once and future dad,George),Lea Thompson(cute and vapid as once and future mom Lorraine)and Thomas Wilson(thick-headed bully Biff,who is a lost treasure here,too) are excellent in fleshing out the characters that stick in one's mind regarding this film. Heck,Old MAn Peabody,Goldie Wilson,Jennifer PArker,MArvin Berry(cousin of Chuck)and the persistently bald and serious-as-heart-attack high school principal all add their own flairs in this movies persona. Robert Zemekis parlayed his Romancing the Stone success to create an even larger-than-life action-fantasy-comedy,with help from plenty of sight and sound FX and a hugely energetic soundtrack anchored by Huey Lewis and the News(remember them?). This film isn't just a renter,this is a keeper! Most people with a sense of fun who long for the eighties movies that accented style over dark or haunting substance should definitely buy this one,tape or DVD.

My only regret about the experience was that I didn't get a chance to redeem the Free Pepsi with purchase of large popcorndiscount coupons they were giving out that day!In a pleasant,average California suburb,ordinary teenager MArty McFly(Michael J.Fox,who was a youngish 24 when he filmed this) dreams of being a rock guitarist as he works his way through school,helping out brilliant-but-fringe local scientist Dr.Emmitt Brown(Christopher Lloyd,adding to his wide range of characters). When an unforeseen crisis interrupts Doc Brown's breakthrough time-machine revelation,MArty is thrust into the machine and becomes the unwitting first participant in time-travel. As if that weren't harrowing enough,he's just found a way to break up his younger parents BEFORE they met and now he has to feverishly find some way to get them back together,lest he and his sibs will never be born.If you can suspend some level of disbelief while watching this(and,really,when SHOULDN'T you suspend some disbelief when watching Spielberg\/Lucas\/Zemekis style of sci-fi films?),this film is as smooth as silk and one fun ride! Besides Fox and Lloyd,Crispin Glover(lovably strange and pathetic as Marty's once and future dad,George),Lea Thompson(cute and vapid as once and future mom Lorraine)and Thomas Wilson(thick-headed bully Biff,who is a lost treasure here,too) are excellent in fleshing out the characters that stick in one's mind regarding this film. Heck,Old MAn Peabody,Goldie Wilson,Jennifer PArker,MArvin Berry(cousin of Chuck)and the persistently bald and serious-as-heart-attack high school principal all add their own flairs in this movies persona. Robert Zemekis parlayed his Romancing the Stone success to create an even larger-than-life action-fantasy-comedy,with help from plenty of sight and sound FX and a hugely energetic soundtrack anchored by Huey Lewis and the News(remember them?). This film isn't just a renter,this is a keeper! Most people with a sense of fun who long for the eighties movies that accented style over dark or haunting substance should definitely buy this one,tape or DVD.
