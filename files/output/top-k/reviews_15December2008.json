[{"date":"15 December 2008","score":"","review":" There have been tons of films that depict addictive drug abuse, but no film does it quite like Darren Aronofsky does in Requiem for a Dream, using camera techniques to mess with your mind and visually drive you insane, much like the characters of the film spiral into drug-induced oblivion. The film is not particularly insightful--it is an independent film-- whose goal is clearly to make a film that shows drug abuse in a way never done before.Requiem follows essentially four characters whose lives go south because of drugs. There is Harry (Leto) and Tyrone (Wayans), two junkies who turn to selling dope to make a living, Marion (Connelly), Harry's girlfriend who will do anything for cocaine, and Sara, Harry's mother, an older, widowed woman who gets selected to be on TV and begins to take pills to suppress her appetite so that she can wear her favorite dress on air. Sara's story is the most jarring and unique to movie plots and therefore feels distanced from the others, but the technique is what matters in Requiem more so than the story itself.This is Aronofsky's film from beginning to end. Numerous camera techniques are employed, particularly rapid sequences of close-ups when the characters are doing their drugs of choice. In addition, Aronofsky uses camera mounts on characters at times and even security cameras to capture some scenes in Sara's storyline. Aronofsky also does various slow downs and speed ups, white fades and more in the editing process that continue to inject director presence into the material. He really experiments with everything with varying degrees of success. What makes Aronofsky's work so great, however, is not the techniques themselves, but how they are allegorical for drug addiction. He feeds them to us in steady and unobtrusive doses at first with the rapid close-ups for the first hour of the film, then as things start to go out of control in the plot, we get more and more abrupt changes in our viewing of the film from camera angles to the edits. It's brilliant because you can easily enjoy the beginning of the film, but by the end you feel really disturbed by everything and it all happens so quickly. Aronofsky actually psychologically messes with you, successfully.Other praise for this film goes mostly to Ellen Burstyn as Sara. She's hauntingly brilliant in showing the gradual turn to insanity. A much deserved Oscar nomination. Leto and Connelly are also good, but this movie is more about how Aronofsky makes them appear rather than how they act.Requiem is really an art film, not a Hollywood-friendly drug movie about the dangers of drugs, but an experiment with the human mind and its ability to be altered by fine director craftsmanship. While there's no true catharsis in the film, it's a movie-watching experience in its own little category by itself and worthy of a try if you're in the mood for something radical. ~Steven CVisit my site at http\/\/moviemusereviews.blogspot.com ","genre":null},{"date":"15 December 2008","score":"","review":" There have been tons of films that depict addictive drug abuse, but no film does it quite like Darren Aronofsky does in Requiem for a Dream, using camera techniques to mess with your mind and visually drive you insane, much like the characters of the film spiral into drug-induced oblivion.

The film centres on two characters, both of whom are the quintessential view of a middle-class conservative (American in particular) of what being free (and freedom itself) means, namely, an obnoxious, dope smoking and long-haired lazy drifter. Dennis Hopper's Billy is that very man and a slightly less obnoxious, more-open minded dope smoking, long haired, lazy drifter, or Wyatt, played by Peter Fonda.After a successful drug deal which involves exploiting several hundred Mexicans (no trouble there then, why break the habits of a lifetime), they cast off their obligations (Wyatt's dumping of his watch) and hit the road heading East on a coast-coast bike ride. They compromise their obligations from the get-go by their need of the dollar, for gas and supplies, therefore to be free in the USA you need money, in other words you can't be. Wyatt and Billy as far as being free go, enjoy their own commercially-funded status symbols e.g. their noisy choppers, leather gear and hope to retire in Florida.Tests to their freedom occur frequently, such as their reliance on their bikes and their own complete lack of knowledge in how to fix them. When Wyatt gets a flat, with little more than a patronising acknowledgement to his far more skilled-superior, and ultimately more independent and free man, their flat is fixed and both are fed without charge. Little is made of this but it is surely a critique of the free and wealthy Wyatt and Billy who extend little kindness to their fellow man. Is being free, the freedom to be an obnoxious buffoon, or a selfish, exploitative obnoxious buffoon? One key demonstration of kindness (necessary from a plot development idea, but out of character) is extended to what seems to be a lonely drifter, but is actually the head of a hippie commune. Wyatt and Billy view the commune's surroundings with undisguised contempt, but one of the members of the commune falls in love with Wyatt and offers him (for me anyway) the true concept of freedom, the freedom to be in love and (in my opinion again) our only real freedom in a generally unfree world.Wyatt's later acknowledgement that we blew it surely refers to this. Wyatt may also recall the fact that he and Billy have enough money to save the commune from certain death (by installing an irrigation system to save the commune's soon-to-die crops), but he was too easily fooled by his money and his greed.My view of this film is clear, Wyatt and Billy are criticised for a narrow-minded view of freedom and even when freedom (the hippie commune) appears in front of them (in the flesh of two pretty women) they don't see it, partly because they are both too stoned and partly because they are too stupid, similarly their ultimate nemeses display similar levels of self-destructive ignorance.Jack Nicholson's character for me is totally out of place in the film. His introduction, stay and departure are really only diversions from the two lead actors and Jack's involvement doesn't even serve to act as a link-man. He appears, tags along and his death does nothing to prevent Wyatt and Billy from travelling on. They don't even appear to go back into town to call the police.About the film techniques, some of the techniques, strange forms of editing are very poorly done and subsequently have no consequence in plot development and are therefore a waste. Much of the film is B-Movie and exploitation-like, the landscapes, the mountains, the people in the cafe, the poor black people waving from their horrible tin huts, the Mardi Gras celebrations and is therefore a movie full of clichés, but the essentially story is powerful and has a phenomenal final 10 minutes, that make for a very watchable film, even today.

While Jim is more or less a ladies man in Paris, Jules' native city of Vienna is where all of his girlfriends are, and he is immediately interested in pursuing a relationship with Catherine. The three of them become close friends, and although Jim feels attraction for Catherine, Jules marries her just in time for the start of the war. Fighting on different sides, Jules for Germany and Jim for the French, the two friends are in constant fear of killing one another in the trenches.When the war ends and both come out unscathed, they can only pursue their lives apart for so long before the three must reunite. The spontaneous Catherine believes she can still live on the edge as she did before the war, but her escapades have ill effects on Jules and Jim. She seduces Jim and rekindles their love, while still being married to Jules and living with him and their daughter. It becomes evident that she has not always been faithful to Jules and a relationship with Jim becomes more plausible. Jules would rather Catherine be happy than lose her to divorce, so he allows a relationship to take place.The love triangle becomes a square, and more corners are added as Catherine's mind becomes less set on one particular man. Catherine is constantly moving from man to man and can never make up her mind, but her lovers line up waiting for her to put out her hand. It is evident as time passes that the irresistible qualities she used to have are fading away and people are dropping out of her life one by one.The film comments on the affect war has on love and friendship, how two best friends can be made enemies just because of where they were born, and also how lovers can be pushed apart or pulled together by the slowness of mail. The film presents the love triangle in a way that may seem feasible at first but eventually falls apart. Love, fidelity, and life all take a major seat among the factors of this work.The opening montage is beautifully crafted and allows the portrayal of an entire story in only a few minutes while keeping the same emotion one would experience had they been watching a story in its entirety. The cinematography also enhances the story by capturing the landscape of Europe in beautiful way, and the characters of our story in a timeless manner. The acting is no less than perfect and provides an incredible sense of realism for this film.

You hear the most outrageous lies about it. Half-baked goggle-box do-gooders telling everybody it's bad for you. Pernicious nonsense. Everybody could stand a hundred chest X-rays a year! Well, as they say, when it rains. After going six months without a single top 300 entry, I have now seen two in a week.A deliriously demented film that was a cult classic the moment it hit the street, Repo Man is a film so memorable that it's tempting to just start naming off characters and occurrences, but instead, I'm put it in the form of a review Emilio Estevez plays Otto, a rebellious young punk who in his opening sequence, is getting fired from his job as a stockboy for mouthing off and attacking a coworker. One day, Otto gets unwittingly drafted into helping a man name Bud repossess a car, and from there, everything goes to sh-t. Angry old ladies, skinhead criminals, government agents, alien conspiracies and even crazy rival repo hombres float through as Otto floats through, amused and bemused, and occasionally terrified. Soon, a $20,000 commission comes up on the docket for anyone who can obtain a certain Chevy Malibu. This car becomes the crux of the film, and changes hands several times, including by rival reposessors, criminal thugs, and even his own co-workers.The film's scenes of repossesion document all the usual risks and dangers of the trade. He gets yelled at, spit on, assaulted and even shot at. He meets tough, cynical co-workers and thanks to one meeting in a repo'd car, even acquires a girlfriend. But if this was all the film presented, it would be a good film, yes, but it would definitely not get the accolades I'm giving it. No, the film has something else up its sleeve, and it is in fact given prominence in the opening scene. Somewhere on the shoulder of the California highway system, a one-eyed man in an eyepatch named J. Frank Parnell is driving the aforementioned Malibu that apparently has something that can...vaporize people in the trunk. Otto becomes very familiar with this car as well as people looking for its occupants before the film reaches its conclusion. On their first meeting, his girlfriend shows him a picture of what is apparently four dead aliens, and he drops her off at the United Fruitcake Organization, which is led by a woman named Rogersz with a metal arm. He also has several run-ins with some larcenous acquaintances of his, a group of ruffians who rob and assault several people and places throughout the film, and have some of the film's funniest lines (Let's go do some crimes!).Whoops, there I go just listing happenings again. Let's talk about the acting.

I saw this film when I was young, about the age of the protagonists in the film, and it really scared and thrilled me at the time. It was my introduction to the great Ray Bradbury, who not only wrote the original story but also the screenplay for this excellent film adaptation. The movie inspired me so much that I actually wrote my first short story as a sort of pastiche of its style and story. I still have the story I wrote saved in a box to look at and laugh from time to time. It would be interesting to take a look at it now, since I have just now seen the film from beginning to end for the first time in over 20 years. Funny, isn't it, how sometimes we forget what our favorite movies are? The story this film tells is so simple as to almost qualify it for a myth. Will Halloway (Vidal Peterson) and his best friend Jim Nightshade (Shawn Carson) are the only people in their little hometown who know the terrible secrets of Mr. Dark's carnival. Will's father, Charles (Jason Robards) is full of regret because his poor health does not enable him to be the kind of father he wanted to be; Will doesn't completely trust his father, because Charles has never really demonstrated the strength to be trustworthy. Together the three must combat the malevolent intent of Mr. Dark (Jonathan Pryce) and his freakish legion of roustabouts and carnies (including gypsy Pam Grier and the sinister Angelo Rossitto, who appeared in Tod Browning's 1931 classic Freaks).I know that I'm a sucker in general for these types of films, but they are few and far between at least as far as high quality stories that are well executed. The film does bear some resemblance to one of my other favorite fantasy carnival films, George Pal's Seven Faces of Dr. Lao which was adapted for film by Bradbury's close friend Charles Beaumont (after whom perhaps the main character of this story is named?). Mr. Dark is like the evil flip side of Dr. Lao -- like Lao he seeks out the deepest desires and fantasies of the town's inhabitants, but his goal is to enslave and devour the people where Dr. Lao seeks to awaken them to their better selves. Interestingly, character actor Royal Dano appears in prominent parts in both films, over 20 years separated in time.I really connect personally also to the whole paternal theme in this film. It is one of the primary themes of fantasy, the idea of searching for a father or of a father seeking redemption. Robards' character is fascinating and he gives a really wonderful performance. In some ways he resents his own father, who was a preacher and did not display affection, but only encouraged him to be firm and sturdy as a Christian soldier. His deep regret in life is that his health prevented him from saving his son from drowning, so that the boy had to be rescued by another man's father -- not coincidentally, the absent father of Will's best friend, Mr. Nightshade. In a more general sense, this particular trauma is tied into his feeling that he is not close enough to his son and that he's simply repeating the mistakes of his own father. Through the course of the story, the father and son find their love and trust for each other by way of confronting their dark fears and regrets which are exposed to them by Mr. Dark.Jon Pryce looks magnificent in his beard and top hat, and does a great job at exuding a sinister and demonic presence with great restraint and no camp at all. The director was able to keep everyone in the film very much focused on the kind of atmosphere that he wanted to create. The supporting actors all got nice moments... I particularly liked the odd bit towards the end with Rossitto dragging off Mr. Dark. Even the child actors help up their weight in the movie, which you don't always see.I would recommend this movie to everyone who likes fantasy with a dark edge, like Harry Potter books and movies, Terry Gilliam movies like Time Bandits, Tim Burton films, and particularly to anyone like myself who appreciates a scary carnival setting. This movie will please Ray Bradbury fans and those who are into The Twilight Zone and fantasy\/sci-fi storytelling of that type as well.

Unquestionably Spielberg's most satisfying film about WWII (and of his career, perhaps), Schindler's List is one of his many directorial highlights because of its message of hope, survival, and humanity during a time in human history that lacked any of those three. This is what Spielberg's vision of World War II was really about regaining a sense of hope, survival, and humanity in grave times.It's been a while since I saw it last. I saw this film about six years ago my sophomore in high school; we had to watch it as part of my world history class. Boy, am I glad I chose to show up those two days we watched this movie because I surely would have missed out on an incredible film experience. This is my favorite film about the Holocaust during World War II; Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) was pure fun about World War II, and Saving Private Ryan (1998) showed the personal cost of World War II.Spielberg is himself a Jew, and his personal feelings about WWII and the plight of the Jews during that time are no secret to anyone who watches his movies about that period in time; has anyone got the feeling he was secretly smirking to himself when Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) was making mincemeat out of those b******s, the Nazis, in Raiders of the Lost Ark? I do. Schindler's List is Spielberg's masterstroke of cinematic film-making. If Raiders of the Lost Ark showed a Jewish kid vicariously living out his fantasies of slaying Nazis, then Schindler's List showed us that that kid has finally grown up.Adapted from Thomas Keneally's book, this heartfelt - and oft-times horrifying - tale is about a German war profiteer named Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) who gives safe haven to over 1,000 Jews (including his loyal accountant, Itzhak Stern, played by a superb Ben Kingsley) in his factory after becoming sensitive to the horrors inflicted upon them by the Nazis, especially by the psychopathic, high-ranking Nazi commandant Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes). By no means a saint, his transformation from womanizing war profiteer who thought nothing of socializing with the Nazis to humanitarian savior is nothing short of a brilliant performance by Neeson, who gives this at-first loathsome character a heart and a human portrayal who risked bankruptcy and certain death to Save one Life, and save the World Entire.What's most striking about this production is its authenticity. Spielberg filmed Schindler's List at the real Nazi concentration at Auschwitz - just to give it that extra-real feeling of authenticity. To make the film fit the time, he chose to film it in black & white, much rather than the easier color print. However, when color does appear in one particular key scene, you get why Spielberg chose to put it there. There's also something so real and believable about the concentration camp scenes that make the imagery during those sequences unforgettable. Who can forget the startling sequences where the Nazis are making the Jewish prisoners strip in freezing-cold weather, and then herd them into darkened rooms where ominous-looking sprinklers loom overhead?Schindler's List is one of the key films about World War II, the Holocaust, and of the 20th century; maybe it's the definitive film about those three. Its historical significance will allow it to never become dated, and will make it one of the best films in the history of cinema. Steven Spielberg probably has, indeed, made the most satisfying film of his career.10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"15 December 2008","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Filmmaker Steven Spielberg's 1993 World War II\/Holocaust drama Schindler's List is a cinematic triumph.

This is my favorite film about the Holocaust during World War II; Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) was pure fun about World War II, and Saving Private Ryan (1998) showed the personal cost of World War II.Spielberg is himself a Jew, and his personal feelings about WWII and the plight of the Jews during that time are no secret to anyone who watches his movies about that period in time; has anyone got the feeling he was secretly smirking to himself when Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) was making mincemeat out of those b******s, the Nazis, in Raiders of the Lost Ark? I do. Schindler's List is Spielberg's masterstroke of cinematic film-making. If Raiders of the Lost Ark showed a Jewish kid vicariously living out his fantasies of slaying Nazis, then Schindler's List showed us that that kid has finally grown up.Adapted from Thomas Keneally's book, this heartfelt - and oft-times horrifying - tale is about a German war profiteer named Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) who gives safe haven to over 1,000 Jews (including his loyal accountant, Itzhak Stern, played by a superb Ben Kingsley) in his factory after becoming sensitive to the horrors inflicted upon them by the Nazis, especially by the psychopathic, high-ranking Nazi commandant Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes). By no means a saint, his transformation from womanizing war profiteer who thought nothing of socializing with the Nazis to humanitarian savior is nothing short of a brilliant performance by Neeson, who gives this at-first loathsome character a heart and a human portrayal who risked bankruptcy and certain death to Save one Life, and save the World Entire.What's most striking about this production is its authenticity. Spielberg filmed Schindler's List at the real Nazi concentration at Auschwitz - just to give it that extra-real feeling of authenticity. To make the film fit the time, he chose to film it in black & white, much rather than the easier color print. However, when color does appear in one particular key scene, you get why Spielberg chose to put it there. There's also something so real and believable about the concentration camp scenes that make the imagery during those sequences unforgettable. Who can forget the startling sequences where the Nazis are making the Jewish prisoners strip in freezing-cold weather, and then herd them into darkened rooms where ominous-looking sprinklers loom overhead?Schindler's List is one of the key films about World War II, the Holocaust, and of the 20th century; maybe it's the definitive film about those three. Its historical significance will allow it to never become dated, and will make it one of the best films in the history of cinema. Steven Spielberg probably has, indeed, made the most satisfying film of his career.10\/10 ","genre":"Biography, Drama, History"},{"date":"15 December 2008","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" 'Watership Down' is an animated film that kicks the usual animated film conventions square in the balls.It tells the story of a group of talking rabbits. Fiver, an apparently clairvoyant rabbit, has a vision that the warren is doomed, and tries to get everyone to leave.Of course his warnings fall largely on elongated, sceptical ears, but a few take notice (apparently he's made accurate predictions in the past - they're not completely gullible) and flee with him. However, their journey to this new safe place on a hill (something else Fiver prophesied) is far from safe, and they have to tackle all sorts of dangers on their way.But these rabbits aren't just fuzzy-wuzzy bunnies that go hoppity-hop. They have their own society and religion, and they worship Frith the sun god.Indeed, the first part of 'Watership Down' actually chronicles the rabbit creation myth. It's drawn in a highly stylised way, setting it apart from the rest of the film.The rest of the film is a much more literal replication of reality, with the English countryside drawn as it is. The rabbits, too, actually look and move like rabbits. Though they do have some anthropomorphic expressions, they are kept as rabbit-like as possible, anchoring the film firmly in the real world (as long as you ignore the fact that rabbits don't talk - at least not in English).However it must be said that the animation is terrible. There really isn't any other word for it. We're not talking about a Disney film here.But that doesn't mater when the story is great. 'Watership Down' is a lot darker than most animated films about fuzzy-wuzzy talking animals. It deals with themes like torture and death in a no-nonsense way, and yes, there is blood. That's not to say it's unsuitable for children, but it's PG for a reason.The characterisation is superb, and you'll find yourself caring about the characters weather you like it or not. Indeed, there I sat, a grown man reduced to tears by a film about talking rabbits. There's no denying that 'Watership Down' is a very moving film.It's usually about here when people try to justify being moved by saying It's not about rabbits - it's about people. But that's nonsense, because this story very clearly is about rabbits. Yes, these rabbits talk and have their own culture and religion, but if you have to call them 'people' to accept that then you seriously need to grow an imagination.Anyway, 'Watership Down' is a masterpiece in storytelling. The acting is completely sincere, and the music - or more particularly the key moments that lack music and let what's on the screen speak for itself - make the film all the more powerful.

More intense than Goldfinger, it sees SPECTRE at its most aggressive. The plot begins with the theft of 2 nuclear bombs. SPECTRE, through its agent #2 Emilio Largo (played by Adolfo Celi), holds the world for ransom, and it is up to Bond to figure out the who, when, and where of the attack. Largo is ably assisted by the best bad-Bond girl in the entire history of the films- Fiona Volpe (played by Luciana Paluzzi). She is both sexy and scary as Largo's top assassin. Unlike the later psycho-vixen in GoldenEye Xenia Onatopp. Volpe is a believable killer- not a overacted character meant for sexual innuendo jokes. Volpe is cool, confident, and a real killer. She easily steals most scenes she appears in. The featured Bond-girl is the character Domino (played by the gorgeous Claudine Auger). Domino is, to me, the most beautiful of the Bond Girls, even over Ursula Andress. Unfortunately, our femme-fatale is dubbed by the same actress who dubbed Andress's lines in Dr. No. Between similar plots and situations, the two characters (Honey Rider from Dr. No and Domino) come across the same, as if it was the same character in both films. Thunderball has no true weaknesses as a Bond film, except the vocal dubbings of many of the actors. Celi, Paluzzi, and others all have their voices overdubbed, and they do not always line up as well. A minor fault when watching. This movie is the Bond Formula at its strongest, being still young and not set in its ways. The plot is a bit hackneyed yet believable, even more so today. The thought of a couple of nuclear weapons being stolen and used as threats for ransom money is not that far-fetched today. Bond is still a detective here, but the fights and action sequences take precedence for the first time throughout a Bond film. There is enough balance to keep the film strong in terms of plot and realistic events with the super-agent storyline.

The defenders will seem to be not up to the task and the villagers will learn to find strength within themselves. The story has been repeated in The Magnificent Seven, a remake of this film, The Three Amigos, and A Bug's Life to name a few favorites. It's a strong core story and works because the looming threat of the bandits' return and the questionable strength of the defenders make for surefire suspense.Samurai examines a rigid class structure and how conflict can temporarily throw this structure out of alignment. The Samurai, the honored warrior class, do not socialize with the relatively low on the totem pole farmers. They serve noble families and are paid well, but an ongoing civil war has destabilized 16th century China and increased the likelihood that there will be samurai looking for work and food. The uncertain times bring the noble mercenaries and lowly farmer temporarily together.Young samurai apprentice Katsushiro will not surprisingly have a romance with the farmer's daughter. We expect as much. They will hide this romance from the girl's father, but not merely because he will disapprove of his daughter's indiscretion, but because it is an insult to the sacrosanct class structure. When the samurai is discovered, is his shame merely that of a man caught in a hidden affair or is it also due to his being caught in a dalliance below his station? Preparation for the coming fight makes up a large portion of the film. Director Kurosawa does an excellent job of laying out the geography of the village as the samurai survey the land they will defend and attempt to discover its weak points. These scenes give the viewer a sense of geography and allow us to participate fully in the film's epic closing battle. We are right in the thick of the action and have a grasp of the strategy taking place.The care taken in preparing the viewer for the battle is refreshing. Modern action film-making more often than not give an impression of tense battle with quick cuts of explosions or swords clashing accompanied by a heroic theme. We understand that chaos is taking place on an epic scope, but have no sense of what exactly is happening. Kurosawa carefully orients the viewer and never loses you in the mayhem. The skirmish at the climax of this film is very small in size, but Kurosawa still manages to create the sense of an epic battle. Forty armored bandits, a few with firearms, will take on about a hundred villagers. But the stakes are high. The villagers if they lose will surely die. They are not trained warriors and there are not nearly enough samurai to defend the village.The final battle is one of the best ever filmed. Deaths are sudden and brutal, but Kurosawa does not linger over them. He rushes us on to the next heated skirmish. The unskilled villagers fight badly, but fight with intense hatred. They swarm in large groups and thrust wildly and clumsily with their makeshift spears. Terrorized for years by the bandits, they act out with great fury when in battle. Cutting between wide shots of the village and close ups of hooves falling and spears thrusting, Kurosawa places us in the midst of the battle. The entire effect is thrilling and frequently disturbing. All of this is accomplished with no visible bloodshed.Kurosawa like Renoir also employs long takes and deep focus to great effect. In early scenes when the villagers are trying to recruit samurai,the director uses a combination of deep focus and forced perspective to underline the villagers' poverty.

The defenders will seem to be not up to the task and the villagers will learn to find strength within themselves. The story has been repeated in The Magnificent Seven, a remake of this film, The Three Amigos, and A Bug's Life to name a few favorites. It's a strong core story and works because the looming threat of the bandits' return and the questionable strength of the defenders make for surefire suspense.Samurai examines a rigid class structure and how conflict can temporarily throw this structure out of alignment. The Samurai, the honored warrior class, do not socialize with the relatively low on the totem pole farmers. They serve noble families and are paid well, but an ongoing civil war has destabilized 16th century China and increased the likelihood that there will be samurai looking for work and food. The uncertain times bring the noble mercenaries and lowly farmer temporarily together.Young samurai apprentice Katsushiro will not surprisingly have a romance with the farmer's daughter. We expect as much. They will hide this romance from the girl's father, but not merely because he will disapprove of his daughter's indiscretion, but because it is an insult to the sacrosanct class structure. When the samurai is discovered, is his shame merely that of a man caught in a hidden affair or is it also due to his being caught in a dalliance below his station? Preparation for the coming fight makes up a large portion of the film. Director Kurosawa does an excellent job of laying out the geography of the village as the samurai survey the land they will defend and attempt to discover its weak points. These scenes give the viewer a sense of geography and allow us to participate fully in the film's epic closing battle. We are right in the thick of the action and have a grasp of the strategy taking place.The care taken in preparing the viewer for the battle is refreshing. Modern action film-making more often than not give an impression of tense battle with quick cuts of explosions or swords clashing accompanied by a heroic theme. We understand that chaos is taking place on an epic scope, but have no sense of what exactly is happening. Kurosawa carefully orients the viewer and never loses you in the mayhem. The skirmish at the climax of this film is very small in size, but Kurosawa still manages to create the sense of an epic battle. Forty armored bandits, a few with firearms, will take on about a hundred villagers. But the stakes are high. The villagers if they lose will surely die. They are not trained warriors and there are not nearly enough samurai to defend the village.The final battle is one of the best ever filmed. Deaths are sudden and brutal, but Kurosawa does not linger over them. He rushes us on to the next heated skirmish. The unskilled villagers fight badly, but fight with intense hatred. They swarm in large groups and thrust wildly and clumsily with their makeshift spears. Terrorized for years by the bandits, they act out with great fury when in battle. Cutting between wide shots of the village and close ups of hooves falling and spears thrusting, Kurosawa places us in the midst of the battle. The entire effect is thrilling and frequently disturbing. All of this is accomplished with no visible bloodshed.Kurosawa like Renoir also employs long takes and deep focus to great effect.

You don't have to have a PhD in Film Studies to appreciate the movie.The film tells the story of Lieutenant Marechal (Jean Gabin) and Captain de Boldieu, two French officers fighting the first world war. Marechal is a pilot and blue collar guy while de Boldieu is an aristocrat. They are shot down by Captain von Rauffenstein, a German aristocrat, while flying a reconnaissance mission.

Whether one likes this film will depend largely on whether one likes Eastwood as an actor and the character he plays, Harry Callahan. Second, the film's villain, a fictional character named Scorpio, is derived loosely from the real-life Zodiac killer who terrorized the Bay Area a couple of years before this film was made.Dirty Harry is a loner San Francisco cop who does things his way. He's tough, hard-nosed, and no-nonsense. He gives the impression that he's tired and feels put-upon. He's fed up with the American legal system that, from his POV, pampers criminals. Since he operates largely outside the bounds of the law, he is a hero to Americans who feel powerless. He routinely gets the toughest assignments, and here he's assigned to Scorpio, a serial killer who kills from city rooftops.Color cinematography is quite good. There's some good sky shots of the city. A lot of scenes take place at night, which enhances suspense; these are the best scenes. My favorite sequence takes place at Mount Davidson Cross in a secluded area. With eerie sound effects, this sequence is quite suspenseful. Yet, I question how a large, densely packed city like San Francisco can be so utterly dark at night.I didn't care for the law and order political message in the film's second half. But that theme does accurately reflect American attitudes of the early 1970s. Also, Harry's distractions on a bank holdup and an attempted suicide seem superfluous. I would have preferred that the story focus exclusively on attempts to catch Scorpio. And the chase at the film's end goes on too long.Otherwise, Dirty Harry, a character study of an unusual cop, is a highly suspenseful film that is well constructed. For its time, it was a violent movie, though by today's standards, it's fairly tame. For viewers who like crime genre films, and for those who like Clint Eastwood, this film probably will be worth watching.

But that theme does accurately reflect American attitudes of the early 1970s. Also, Harry's distractions on a bank holdup and an attempted suicide seem superfluous. I would have preferred that the story focus exclusively on attempts to catch Scorpio. And the chase at the film's end goes on too long.Otherwise, Dirty Harry, a character study of an unusual cop, is a highly suspenseful film that is well constructed. For its time, it was a violent movie, though by today's standards, it's fairly tame. For viewers who like crime genre films, and for those who like Clint Eastwood, this film probably will be worth watching.

First, this film is very much a Clint Eastwood vehicle. Whether one likes this film will depend largely on whether one likes Eastwood as an actor and the character he plays, Harry Callahan. Second, the film's villain, a fictional character named Scorpio, is derived loosely from the real-life Zodiac killer who terrorized the Bay Area a couple of years before this film was made.Dirty Harry is a loner San Francisco cop who does things his way. He's tough, hard-nosed, and no-nonsense. He gives the impression that he's tired and feels put-upon. He's fed up with the American legal system that, from his POV, pampers criminals. Since he operates largely outside the bounds of the law, he is a hero to Americans who feel powerless. He routinely gets the toughest assignments, and here he's assigned to Scorpio, a serial killer who kills from city rooftops.Color cinematography is quite good. There's some good sky shots of the city. A lot of scenes take place at night, which enhances suspense; these are the best scenes.

In almost any other war that is popularly represented in films it can be difficult to draw the line between good guy and bad guy. Certainly a film made in one of the belligerent countries has a tendency to simply portray their own countrymen as heroes and those of opposing nations as villains.The Second World War does not have such wavy distinctions however. The war clearly pitted the allied nations, of which most were free democratic countries with one partner, the Soviet Union, a notable exception which could be described as the lesser of two evils at best, against the most brutal expansionist powers since the Roman Empire. This makes it quite easy for a filmmaker to vilify the Germans, Japanese, and Italians, but what of a film that features them as the main characters? What of a film that paints some of them in a heroic light nonetheless? Sam Peckinpah's Cross of Iron handles this issue quite well. In order to reconcile the heroism of the average soldier with the brutality of the government they serve the main cast of characters is a rag-tag group of soldiers that have found themselves in this war and just wish to do their job and come out alive, politics be damned. To heighten this, the main conflict in the story is not against the Soviet enemy, but against a politically motivated and glory obsessed party line Prussian aristocrat. This method of dealing with The Nazi Problem is really quite common in films from Germany as well as from other nations and does depend a bit on a popularized German stereotype, but it is effective in separating the actions of the common soldier from that of the regime, though one wonders how different this film would be if the enemy had been the Americans or British, rather than the admittedly inhumane Soviets.These distinctions aside the film is a fantastic testament to the ability of the independent and human spirit to endure the ravages of most brutal war and is certainly worth a watching for anyone interested in war films or cinema in general.

The film explores the lives of two pubescent girls who have never experienced a normal life. As the father of two grown daughters, I squirm at the film's brief glimpses into their demented home life. If the parents had not been killed in a car crash, their children may well have turned on them.For reasons left unexplained, the two girls determine to leave their unidentified home state for Kentucky; after surviving a car crash that kills their parents.The two girls are fraternal twins, and could hardly be more different. Rosie is the more aggressive and intelligent of the twins. She is filled with rage at her dead father and that rage is going to find an outlet when some man offends her. Violet is the more passive and naive of the two girls. She is more advanced into puberty than her sister and is really vulnerable to the first man who will treat her better than her abusive father.When the two girls stow away in the back of a pickup truck, they land in the home of an itinerant grounds keeper on an Army Post. The film was probably using an abandoned Army Post for these location shots. No operational Army Post would become so decrepit if the commanding officer hoped to have a successful career. The supposedly authentic military vehicles were really a hoot to see. I doubt that many of them would even run.The film soldiers on this Post are really homo erotic in their behavior. I suppose this tendency would pass muster in Hollywood, but never in the real Army. There is only one officer on this post and only one mid-level NCO. The budget limitations on this film really showed in the lack of anything resembling a real command structure.The two girls set up what passes for housekeeping in their limited experience. They sleep in their undies on sofa cushions on the living room floor of the shack that serves as living quarters for the grounds keeper. It took no mental giant to see that eventually the grounds keeper would wind up sleeping with one or both of these vulnerable young girls.The two girls start to drift apart when their environment is no longer as hostile as their horrible home life. Violet starts to make friends with the grounds keeper she works with daily. He is obviously responding emotionally to her feminine charms and that is very appealing to her developing sexuality. Rosie is enraged with both the grounds keeper and her sister as the formerly united front breaks down.The plot has the two girls attending a dance as supposed dates for the grounds keeper. They somehow came up with dresses that could pass muster for this event despite having been out on the road without anything more than the clothes on their backs. Obviously, some shopping never shown in the film would have been necessary to outfit the twins.Well, the film ends as Rosie maneuvers the grounds keeper into a vulnerable situation where she can murder him. Violet reacts by breaking the last bond with her sister and skipping out with the money stolen from the dead grounds keeper. My skin crawled as the abandoned Rosie hums a little tune as she plays Russian Roulette with the revolver she used to kill the grounds keeper.I suppose that I wanted to see the twins recover from their damaged childhood and live worthwhile lives. The eventual fate of Violet is left a blank. Rosie most likely commits suicide. Sadly, that happens in real life. This film really got to me despite its production flaws and limited budget. I really was yelling for Rosie to put down the gun as the film credits started rolling. This film would not be a wise choice for young children for obvious reasons.

Bruce Willis does what he does best; that is to say, he's annoying to the point where I was hoping someone would kill him and put us all out of our misery, even though I thoroughly enjoyed his character when he wasn't being mean to his wife. Glenne Headly was amazing and Harvey Keitel, one of my favorites, was once again the consummate cop.But the best part of this movie, for me, was the realism. The New Jersey accents sounded natural and unaffected, especially Harvey Keitel's pronunciation of Joyce's name as Jerce. The homes looked like regular folks lived there, not like designer-inspired movie sets. The clothes were real, the hairdos were real, and the way the characters behaved was real.I've seen this film a couple of times and I haven't found any glaring plot holes; everything follows a believable and sensible course. If Demi Moore's character is lying, she's doing a damn good job of it.The only problem I have with the story -- and it is a problem I have with many stories -- is that at some point the characters completely abandon their day-to-day lives. After Jimmy's funeral it seems that Joyce never returns to the beauty shop that she owns and Cynthia and Cookie never work another day in their lives, even though all three women depend on the income from their jobs. I would have preferred to see how Joyce's alleged descent into madness affected her business, how her customers reacted to her, and how she and the other stylists interacted during working hours.Overall I give this film an 8 out of 10.
