He growls, smirks, and spits his way through a terrific performance before his character is converted to Forrest's religion. Other than that, there's not much meat in this movie. I thought Hanks was pretty good as Gump, but it's not a role that you can screw up too badly because there's very little character to slip into.The biggest problem with it is the artificial, plastic directing job, something that other Zamekis productions suffer from also. The sequence of dying Lt. Dan ancestors is particularly egregious - it's supposed to be funny, I think, but doesn't quite make it. I'm also at a loss to explain why we needed the Gump within a Gump voiceover narration. It only adds to the syrupy tone with the kind of pseudo-humor you see in many TV commercials. This story could have told itself quite well without this and similar directorial tricks.I was a little bit bothered by the right-wing sensibilities present, but not all that much. I'm used to the co-opting of counter-culture product to prove alternate ideals (like the idea behind John Lennon's Imagine). Using a false history as a dramatic device is OK with me, just do something interesting with it. Hollywood has a tendency to de-legitimize creativity as merely the accident of situation. Zamekis has done this before in Back to the Future, where Chuck Berry supposedly gets his inspiration for Johnny B. Good from one performance (instead of years of hard work). I hate it when this is used for a joke - and not a very good one, usually. Just like many things in this movie, it's pandering to the nostalgia of the audience. Similar things are done to Bear Bryant. But I digress.The best scene in the movie is when Hanks sees Sinise at the dock and runs into the water to greet him. It sums up both characters beautifully. And despite (or maybe because of) the heavy borrowing from other movies, other good scenes are the barroom scene with Hanks and Sinise, the orgasm scene, and the initial meeting of Hanks and his Drill Sergeant. I mention these because they don't typify the piled-on heavy sentiment that the rest of the movie employs.

Case in point is the widespread comparison to Saving Private Ryan.  As others have said, these two movies share little in common beyond being war movies and are good for very different reasons.Saving Private Ryan, while a good movie, is about as unsubtle in its presentation as a movie can possibly be, displaying gratuitous gory action and having an obvious and shallow theme (about courage, sacrifice, rememberance and all that...worthy to be sure but nothing new).  It is a mainstream, mass-appeal action movie with a politically-correct, All-American theme.  Its popularity was written in the stars.Then we have The Thin Red Line.  People aren't sure what to make of it. Some people come in expecting typical war movie and are bitterly disappointed.  Others are just bored with it and couldn't care less about the questions it raises.  My take is that it is a cerebral, fascinating, thought-provoking movie depicted with superb cinematography and a unique style.  Its multiple meanings are right there under the surface if you care to look, although the real meaning is in the feelings it (should) evoke.It isn't the characters who are all having these philosophical episodes while under fire...it's supposed to be you, as we see the events though the eyes of the rather dreamy fellow the movie mostly follows. SPR tried to make you feel like you were there.  TTRL presents the action more as a case study in humanity, where the individual personas are unimportant compared to the broader questions about life itself.  In this way it goes far beyond the token anti-warness of Saving Private Ryan (although admittedly foregoing some of the high-adrenaline action of the latter).One of the negative reviews here hit the nail on the head comparing the movie to a nature documentary.  That reviewer didn't see the relevance of showing the singing natives, the colorful animals, and the beauty of the island.  He must have trouble with such concepts as irony, juxtaposition, imagery, and all that other jazz your English teacher droned on about in high school.  Where is the anti-war message? asks one reviewer.  Well, it's the entire movie.In the end, The Thin Red Line works on many levels.  It will go down as a misunderstood classic because it doesn't sit down with the audience and patiently explain a nice, easy, Hallmark-card sentiment.  It flies right over the head of Average Joe.  That may sound arrogant but it's the simple truth, and you don't have to be Einstein to comprehend this movie.

This film is so snappy and stylish and exciting that it almost doesn't need a story but it DOES have one, and one that is, I think, a little deeper than most reviews suggest.First off, the performances are wonderful. Stamp is amazing, but the film is virtually stolen by his Latino sidekick, whose every moment on screen is just precious. I wish other directors would watch this movie to get an idea on how to liven up the dull moments of their more conventional movies.Now, the ending THIS WILL BE A MAJOR SPOILER IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE, but if you have, consider this interpretationIt feels like a bit of a letdown when Wilson doesn't kill Valentine, but looked at another way, the ending offers a grace note that illuminates all that came before it. When Valentine tells Wilson the detail about Jenny holding up the phone and threatening to call the police Wilson remembers her doing the same thing to him. And he knows that she wouldn't have called the police, but Valentine DIDN'T know that. In this way he realizes that it is not really Valentine who is responsible for her death, but he himself bears most of the responsibility by creating this need in a daughter that sought a father substitute in Valentine. I take his violence through the whole movie as his projection of his own guilt onto others--there are many discussions with the Lesley Ann Warren character about how he doesn't take responsibility for the way his daughter turned out--at the end he turns away from violence and takes the responsibility for her death upon himself. In doing so he realizes that his daughter was not running away from him, but searching for him in other men. It's really kind of a very beautiful, very literary ending, but one that is I think too subtle for most viewers.I wish more paid film critics were up to the task of interpreting subtle films, but nowadays you have films by Cronenberg, Spike Lee, Kubrick and others who are just over the heads of critics.

This is one of the most brilliant horror films I have ever seen!For those of you this movie is BAD, I think your reasons are unjustified. I'm going to list the many reasons why people thought this movie was bad.1. It was a home made movie-----The whole premise of this movie was to show the footage of three filmmakers who went into the woods and disappeared. The ads clearly said that this was their footage? What were you all expected. A glossy, high budget, special effects driven film, with lots of scary music and gore? Come on, these were film students!! The film remain true to that premise and did not deviate from it in any way. This was to look like a home video, and that made the film seem all the more real, therefore, much more effective.2. Those kids were so stupid....Oh, as opposed to those brilliant teenagers we see in movies like Friday the 13th, I Know What You Did..., and countless other slasher films? Give me a break!!! Heather, Josh, and Mike were about as naiive as you and I, but they certainly were not stupid!! Many said they should have carried a cell phone with them. How many people in 1994 had cell phones compared to how common it is today for people to have one? Some said they should have been better prepared for camping. Hello! If any of you who said that had an ATTENTION SPAN would have learned that Heather is the type of person who goes camping and is familiar with navigating her way through the woods. Most importantly, these kids would have found their way out of the woods if they were not scared out their minds!! They were researching a legend, that they apparently believed was not true. Nothing these kinds ever did made me want to shout STUPID! STUPID! at them. I however have wanted to do that to many of the characters in several films. Plus, the characters in most slasher films have a choice to what danger they put themselves in. They know a killer is on the loose. In Blair Witch, the kids were lost in the woods before they realized something unexpected was hunting them down.3. The acting was TERRIBLE!...There were many people who saw this film and thought it was real. Oh, but how could that happen if the acting was so bad? They should have known by that it was all fake, right? I think many of you have confused bad acting with raw acting. The acting in this film wasn't meant to be dramatic, otherwise the film wouldn't have worked. The fact that the acting was so raw, made the film all the more realistic.4. Nothing ever happens in the movie, it's so boring....Apparently you who say this do not know how to use your imagination. Plenty happens in this film. Imagine how you would react if you heard strange noises in the form of laughing in the woods, or if someone was attacking your tent, or if you then found and area of the woods with all these occultic symbols, or if you heard your friend screaming in the woods and you were unable to help him, and then find parts of his body wrapped in his clothing...Many of these things gave me the chills becuase I was able to put myself in their shoes.5. They should run for their lives....What in the world do you think they were doing the whole movie?? They were walking, and running, and running, and going in circles and losing their mind. If you knew what it feels like to be lost, you'd understand that panic ensues and thinking your way out of a situation becomes harder and harder. And when they heard Josh's voice in the house I wasn't surprised they went in after him because that is something I would do in such a desperate situation.I guess many of you still need to the graphic violence and gore for a movie to entertain you and simply can't use your imaginations. Go on and continue to be entertained by the brainless horror films like Friday the 13th. I guess the Blair Witch Project is just way out of your league.This was one of the most original films of the decade and was so worthy of the hype. Many films used hype like TBWP. Psycho comes to mind as Hitchcock stated that NO ONE would be admitted after the beginning of the film. This sparked everyone's curioisity thinking that something happens at the beginning. There's nothing wrong with this as long as the film lives up to that hype. Psycho and Blair Witch both did that.Face it, Blair Witch Project will go down in movie history as one of the greatest horror films ever made along with Psycho, Halloween, The Exorcist, Jaws, Silence of the Lambs, Seven, and Scream. All of these films redefined the horror genre and expounded the limits of what horror films could do at that time.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy"},{"date":"12 October 1999","score":"","review":" Forget the talk of plot twists, this is just plain great movie making that deservedly put M. Night on the map. Not really a movie about the occult, it's more what you might call a psychological drama. Bruce Willis gives the most solid performance of his career as a child psychologist attacked by one of his charges and changed forever. Haley Joel Osment is his new charge, a child who simply can't fit in with his peers with a very different way of looking at things. Toni Collette is grand as the troubled mom trying to find a way to solve Haley's problems. They really don't make movies this good very often at all, I don't know what won the Oscar for Best Picture in 2000 but I can tell you what movie should have won. A fantastic and effective score accompanies this most exceptional movie. Highly highly recommended.

Its based on the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle book, and is not related to the recent Steven Spielberg Lost World, which is based on a book by Michael Crichton.  The dialogue is silly to the point of being hilarious, but this is in part due to the fact that its a silent film; long complex dialogue can't be flashed on the screen.  Furthermore, when you think about it, much of the writing in today films is worse(The 1997 Lost World isn't exactly a stunning work of drama), a thought which is really sad.  The special effects, created by the Willis O'Brian, who did the effects for King Kong, were easily the best of the time.  They seem even better when you consider that many years after this film, dinosaurs and monsters where men dressed in suits or lizards attacking scale sets.  I recently saw the 1992 version of this film and found it quite amusing that the dinosaurs in it where much less convincing than those in original, almost 70 years earlier.  This film was in many ways the predecessor of all the travel, adventure, monster, and sci-fi films.  If you watch Spielberg's Lost World, you'll note that it borrows many ideas from this film.

You laugh, you cry, you are carried away.Kate Winslet stars as a seeker after the truth. She thinks that she finds something meaningful with an Indian guru. Her white trash Ausie family thinks otherwise, and they kidnap her to have her deprogrammed by the number one U.S. deprogrammer, played by Harvey Keitel. This leads to a conflict in which each character explores, changes, figures out what he or she is looking for, or at least figures out what to next in their lives to fulfill them.This is a movie with great sparks of humor, some wonderful laughs, some wonderful cinematography including some visual treats involving a third eye, or a lighted match. Just when you think the movie will get bogged down into a heavy discussion, it is lifted up by some surprise plot twist, or by characters going further than you dared thought they would go.It carries you along, and you don't want it to end. After you think it has ended, there is a very satisfying coda, so that you know where the characters wound up after the transforming events of this film.This is a great great film.
