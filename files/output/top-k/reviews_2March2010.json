[{"date":"2 March 2010","score":"","review":" The hook that New Line Cinema is using to draw people into 15 Minutes is that people are addicted to sensationalistic violence, and as one character puts it, If it bleeds, it leads. The draw here is that there are two psychopaths who are using this known fact to bring themselves fame by documenting the gruesome murders that they commit and selling them to the media. While this is true, the social satire of the film is really only visible during the beginning and at the end. The bulk of the film is a standard order police procedural, but it's still engaging.Two immigrants, Emil (Karel Roden) and Oleg (Oleg Taktarov) have come to the United States to collect their share of a bank robbery they committed. When their cohort had spent their share of the loot, Emil kills him and the guy's girlfriend, while Oleg captures it on the camera he just stole. It doesn't take long before they realize the potential of filming their violent crimes. Hot on their trail are an alcoholic cop named Eddie Fleming (Robert DeNiro), who is the famed pet of tabloid guru Robert Hawkins (Kelsey Grammar, and arson investigator Jody Warsaw (Edward Burns).The film is a mixed bag. There are some good things about this film, and there are some that are awful. I'll give it credit for taking some chances and going in unexpected directions, but it also has some moments of jaw-dropping stupidity. And while there's some genuine tension in the film and the premise is interesting, I felt a little let down. Not only isn't the social satire original, it's not even effectively wedded into the main story. Also, I felt betrayed by the advertising of this film; I was expecting a cat-and-mouse type thriller between the cops and the criminals, and the media who is exploiting it. However, seeing as writer\/director John Herzfeld wasn't trying to go for this angle (at least I hope not...), I can't really blame the film for this, just the studio.The acting is adequate. Eddie is a role that Robert DeNiro could do in his sleep. It doesn't require to stretch his range, but then again, DeNiro is still highly enjoyable to watch when he's not really trying, so it doesn't matter. Edward Burns seems a little out of his element, but his performance isn't a complete bust. The villains are the stars of the show. If you want a frighteningly psychopathic Russian villain, they don't come any better than Karl Roden. Emil is one nasty piece of work whose logic to his plan is frighteningly plausible. His counterpart, Oleg Takratov, isn't as smart and too starry-eyed by fame to be as dangerous as Emil, but he's not everything he seems to be. The part of Richard Hawkins deserves to be played in an over-the-top manner (is there any other way to play a Jerry Springer\/Geraldo Rivera clone?), but Grammar doesn't go far enough to be truly vile, though I liked the fact that he gave Hawkins a small dose of humanity (whethere it was genuine or not is up for debate). Small parts by Melina Kanakaredes (who is wasted as Eddie's girlfriend), Vera Farmiga, and Charlize Theron (in a blink and you'll miss it appearance) are great.This isn't an especially bad film, but I don't know if there's enough good stuff to outweigh the bad.

There's the basis for a good story here, but the film doesn't seem to know how to handle it so that, once escaped prisoner Kevin Costner hits the road with his little hostage in tow, the story seems to stop going forward. Costner is very good in the role of Butch, a petty career criminal whose fate is inextricably linked to the sheriff, played by Clint Eastwood, who is leading the manhunt for him. In fact, the character of Butch is well-written &#x96; more so than any other of the characters, who all seem rather flat and unfocused in comparison. His accomplice in the prison escape is a strictly by-the-numbers bad guy, but at least he brought some life to the film while he was on screen.The story seems to be focused on the fact that the father makes the man, and prison discipline is no substitute for an absent father. Not exactly earth-shaking stuff, but the film seems to think so. It worries the subject like a dog growling at the bone clamped between its jaws while trying to develop a sense of pathos through the growing relationship between Butch and his captive. Of course, Butch sees echoes of himself in the fatherless Philip, the son of a devout Jehovah's Witness mother who refuses to allow him trick or treating. Tellingly, Philip (or Buzz, as he chooses to be called once free of his mother) spends much of the film dressed as a ghost.I don't like to criticise the performance of kids in films, but the young lad who plays Philip really needed a couple more years in drama school before appearing in front of the screen. The film's meandering pace shudders to a virtual halt in the last fifteen minutes, just when it should be working up a head of steam, and the finale seems to last forever. This is something of a surprise, because even when he's telling a slight tale, Eastwood usually manages the pacing of his films very well.

Based on the television show of the same name it is also probably the most successful and best television show to movie I have ever seen. It also has that major plus in that at the end of the movie you are done with your journey and everything wraps up rather nicely. The story has Dr. Kimble accused of murder and we speed through the trial as the police do not believe for a minute Dr. Kimble's story of a fight he had with the actual killer, the one armed man. Well through some good and bad luck at the same time, he finds himself free of the prisoner transport he was on and now he is set loose to try and clear his name and bring the real killer to justice. On his trail though is a United States Marshall played by the very good actor Tommy Lee Jones. In fact, Jones would win an Oscar for his performance in this movie. He would later reprise this role, but with little success in the film U.S. Marshals, my thinking is though that it might have done better at the box office had they not simply made almost a remake of this movie with the wrongly accused escapee, but instead had him track someone actually guilty of the crime. This one though has some great cat and mouse as you really pull for Kimble (played by the excellent Harrison Ford) to connect all the pieces and find the party responsible for his wife's death. Most of the action is confined to the city of Chicago I think it was, but there is enough action and such to make up for the lack of locales. Though there is a great scene involving a dam and the inner workings of it as Kimble is almost caught right off the bat by Gerard (the marshal).

In 1930, they created the Hayes Code, used to tell what could and couldn't be in a movie. The Code was used for 38 years, until 1968, when it was replaced by the rating system used even today by the MPAA. And when the rating system started, the worst rate a movie could get was and still is the X rating, used in most cases only for Adult movies. But even with a X rating, the 1969 John Schlesinger's movie 'Midnight Cowboy' was able to win 3 Oscars, including best picture, being the only X-rated movie ever to win an Oscar with such a rating. This proves how good and powerful this movie is, and how it shocked the late-1960's society.'Midnight Cowboy' tells the story of Joe Buck (John Voight), a Texas greenhorn that, bored with his life in the countryside, decides to move to New York and work as a hustler. But he finds out that life in New York isn't as easy as he thought, until he teams up with a city bum, named Ratzo Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman). Together, they struggle to survive in the city's hard life, while they become even more good friends. The movie's screenplay is based on a novel by James Leo Herlihy. I haven't read the book in which the movie is based on, but I can say Waldo Salt did a incredible job adapting the Oscar-winning movie's screenplay. There isn't one bit missing, and the movie flows in a incredible way. It doesn't lose its pace in one single moment, and the story here couldn't be better. Throughout these two iconic and unforgettable characters, the movie develops themes like homosexuality, drugs, the life in the city for those who have nothing, prejudice, etc. These themes are all incredibly presented, in a subtle but very ferocious way, reaching out for the very soul of the American society.The acting here couldn't be any better and this movie couldn't be more well-casted. I dare to say it's one of the best overall acting ever, along with movies like 'Kramer vs. Kramer' or 'A Streetcar Named Desire'. The whole cast does a perfect job, even with small parts. The Oscar-nominated performance by Sylvia Miles as Cass, one of Joe's clients is excellent. The rest of the supporting cast do an equally incredible job, especially Brenda Vaccaro as Shirley, other Joe's client. Aside from the not so-famous but excellent supporting cast, we have in the main roles two major stars, in probably the best performances of both's career - John Voight and Dustin Hoffman. They were both Oscar-nominated for their roles as Joe Buck and Ratso Rizzo respectively, and they both lost to John Wayne for his role in 'True Grit'. John Wayne was good, indeed, but his performance wasn't even the half of the job Hoffman and Voight did. This is certainly one of the biggest injustices in Oscar's history, but more for Dustin Hoffman. Of course Voight was also incredible, doing a naive but at the same time wild interpretation, which is perfect for the character, but Hoffman did what is probably one of the best performances by a male actor in movie's history. There isn't anything I can say to describe his work. Brilliant, absolutely brilliant.And even with this incredibly good screenplay, and one of the best overall acting ever, this movie wouldn't be the same without the Oscar- winning John Schlesinger's directing work. His direction is very experimental, but who wasn't in 1969? Now that the Hayes Code went down, anything was possible, and Schlesinger utilizes this in a incredible manner. He uses a few long, gentle shots, and others more vivid, with a fast editing when the character was stoned or in his dreams, for example. The use of flashbacks here is also great, as we follow the past events only in Joe's mind, so we don't really find out what happened in Texas with his ex-girlfriend, a quite important subject for the movie's story. Throughout the film, we hear a lot of the original song made for the movie by Fred Neil, called Everybody's Talking'. While the music is great, in a very nice folk style, its constant use bothers you after a while. The cinematography here also bothered me a little bit, the movie could have a darker treatment.Overral, 'Midnight Cowboy' is an almost perfect piece of cinema. The winner of the best picture Oscar in 1969, and the only X-rated movie to accomplish this, has a perfect screenplay, with unforgettable characters and dialogs, excellent lines, and a very nice pace. It also features one of the best acting work ever, specially with Dustin Hoffman, in the best work of his career. John Schlesinger is equally great, making this movie a must-see for anyone.9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"2 March 2010","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" The MPAA (Motion picture Association of America) was created in 1922 in order to regulate movie making in the United States by all the six major studios.

They were both Oscar-nominated for their roles as Joe Buck and Ratso Rizzo respectively, and they both lost to John Wayne for his role in 'True Grit'. John Wayne was good, indeed, but his performance wasn't even the half of the job Hoffman and Voight did. This is certainly one of the biggest injustices in Oscar's history, but more for Dustin Hoffman. Of course Voight was also incredible, doing a naive but at the same time wild interpretation, which is perfect for the character, but Hoffman did what is probably one of the best performances by a male actor in movie's history. There isn't anything I can say to describe his work. Brilliant, absolutely brilliant.And even with this incredibly good screenplay, and one of the best overall acting ever, this movie wouldn't be the same without the Oscar- winning John Schlesinger's directing work. His direction is very experimental, but who wasn't in 1969? Now that the Hayes Code went down, anything was possible, and Schlesinger utilizes this in a incredible manner. He uses a few long, gentle shots, and others more vivid, with a fast editing when the character was stoned or in his dreams, for example. The use of flashbacks here is also great, as we follow the past events only in Joe's mind, so we don't really find out what happened in Texas with his ex-girlfriend, a quite important subject for the movie's story. Throughout the film, we hear a lot of the original song made for the movie by Fred Neil, called Everybody's Talking'. While the music is great, in a very nice folk style, its constant use bothers you after a while. The cinematography here also bothered me a little bit, the movie could have a darker treatment.Overral, 'Midnight Cowboy' is an almost perfect piece of cinema. The winner of the best picture Oscar in 1969, and the only X-rated movie to accomplish this, has a perfect screenplay, with unforgettable characters and dialogs, excellent lines, and a very nice pace. It also features one of the best acting work ever, specially with Dustin Hoffman, in the best work of his career. John Schlesinger is equally great, making this movie a must-see for anyone.9\/10 ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"2 March 2010","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" The biggest name associated with The Milagro Beanfield War is its director Robert Redford.

Which I think is a shame. Cause a terrific director like him should be doing tons. Maybe, since he's done five masterpieces already, he's afraid that if he does more, than he'll go on a losing streak. I don't believe that will happen. It happened with Steven Spielberg once(I hated Artificial intelligence). But with Anderson, I doubt it's going to happen. Anderson's five films have been Hard eight, Boogie nights, Magnolia, Punch Drunk love, and There will be blood. I'll admit that I never saw Hard eight. But I saw the other four. and loved them all. Only a couple of them may sound familiar to some. Those few are probably Boogie nights, Punch drunk love, and There will be blood. I loved all of those, but none of them are my favorite. My favorite Paul Thomas Anderson film is called Magnolia. There are moments in Magnolia that will make you laugh, they will make you go Yeah, stick it to the man, and it will make you goWell, that's not very nice. But there is one moment that will make you go What the hell. That moment is a scene where it starts to rain frogs. That's another thing that I love about his movies. In some of them he throws in the most random of stuff and never explains any of it. Why did it rain frogs? We don't know. He does though. And he just wants us to go What the hell.Magnolia is the original Crash. Except that one won best picture of the year. American Beauty won best picture in 1999. Magnolia wasn't even nominated for Best Picture. Which I think is a crime. My top two favorite films of 1999 weren't even nominated. Magnolia was one of them. This is such a real movie. The performances are just spectacular. Especially from Tom Cruise. Now that surprised me. He was nominated. But lost. Which is another crime.Well, if you know the plot, then you know the plot to Magnolia. But I shall explain it. Magnolia is the story of a group of people living in San Fernando Valley. They are all connected in some way. John C. Reilly plays a cop that falls for a cocaine addict. The cocaine addict has problems with her father(played by Phillip Baker Hall), who hosts a game show. On this game show, is a boy named Stanley(played by Jeremy Blackman)who is being forced to play cause of his father. William H. Macy is also great as a nerdy guy who was once on the game show himself.Juilianne Moore plays a woman who married an older man for his money. But now he has cancer and she's in love with him and doesn't want to be in the will. The problem is that they don't know who will be in the will. Because the only other person that could be in it is the elderly man's son(played by Tom Cruise), who he hasn't seen since he was ten years old. Magnolia is occasionally funny, like most of his films. I loved everything about this movie. I loved it's occasional strangeness. I loved the lessons that it teaches. I also loved how it shows coincidences. Such as the opening scene. These actors are great. William H. Macy has played a dorky character in a couple of films. And he really succeeds here. Like always. Everyone does. Magnolia is just a masterpiece. Oh, I forgot to mention Phillip Seymour Hoffman. He is very good here too.

In the film, our main character, John Murdoch, wakes up in a dingy hotel bath tub, bleeding from his forehead. Scared and confused, he comes to find that he is the suspect in a string of brutal murders and hot on his tale is a mysterious organization known as the Strangers, who oddly resemble the cenobites in Clive Barker's Hellraiser, but whom have the ability to warp the world around them.Like The Crow before it, Dark City is heavy on set-design, bleak atmosphere and memorable visuals, but thankfully, the script (co-written by David S. Goyer) is smart enough not to hinge on special effects and set design, and rather, toys with your expectations while delivering something stream-lined and efficient, instead of being overly long and bloated like it very well could have been. Driving the film is Rufus Sewell as Murdoch, a character who is never sure if what he is seeing or doing is even real. While Sewell sells it, his co-star, Jennifer Connelly, unfortunately isn't given much to do other than look good and sad. Thankfully performances by William Hurt and Keifer Sutherland inject some energy into the narrative, only to bounce off of the underplayed humanity on display by Sewell.While The Matrix, released a year later, would overshadow its influence on the science fiction world and pop-culture in general, it's worth noting that the film still stands as one of the best genre films of the 90's and begs to be seen by anyone with a love for sci-fi in need of some refreshment. It's perhaps the best film by Proyas, and at a breezy 96 minutes, it gets the job done well, never wasting a moment or sacrificing exposition.

Granted, there are more difficult movies for one to jump into directing with but I've seen so many film sequels picked up by non-directors fail that I commend Rogers for a decent job here.

The film does a great job of bringing back that same raunchy yet occasionally heart-warming humor of the first; at points I almost felt as if the filmmakers were reaching a bit with the gags, but I still found myself laughing.The entire original cast returned for American PIE 2 (which is good because I doubt if it ever would have worked otherwise). Jason Biggs is back in the role that jump-started his career and retains that awkward presence that keeps finding Jim in the worst situations.

Norman Bates returns to the Bates motel after 23 years and is trying to get on with his life. Anthony Perkins reprises his signature role with class and gives Norman a dignity even though you know about his past. Norman is not the bad guy of the movie - he is the victim which is a quite clever change to follow on from the original. The trouble is how do you follow a film like Psycho? I think Tom Holland does a fine job of creating another story with the characters. Although its a shame Lila turned out the way she did but I can understand her anger and hate. Meg Tilly is so lovely in this film, her character begins to feel a little sympathy for Norman and he definitely feels something for her. When she is gone at the end there is a real sadness.

The first film, a VHS rarity from 1998 (surprisingly no DVD option yet), gave the opportunity to tour the back roads of Belgrade without leaving the comfort of the couch. It was dark, it was disruptive, it was random; it was Cabaret Balkan. Told in a storyline similar to that of recent films like Babel or Amores Perros, Cabaret Balkan takes a socially dynamic state, gives the viewers a smorgasbord of one-dimensional characters, and allows the traveling to begin. As a tourist destination, one may consider booking another location, but as a cinematic endeavor, it packs light punches, interesting stories, and that seedy darkness that seems to follow Serbia wherever it goes. From one sad story to the next, we are forced to enter the lives of virtual unknown, to ask ourselves what would be our response in a similar situation, and to accept &#x96; willing or unwilling &#x96; that this film speaks the truth. That chaos is normal in Belgrade. To believe that a normal passenger, on a normal night, can easily become twisted in the evil that stirs in this cold city. Cabaret Balkan asks quite a bit from its viewers, in essence to extend belief and trust that these endings speak for an entire world, but if you allow your mind to watch, your belief to be suspended, Balkan proves to be spooky, entertaining, and vividly depressing all at once.For those unwilling to experiment back with the VHS option, this is a film saturated in colorful characters. From fighting best friends, to a corrupt cop finding his comeuppance, to a bickering couple found in the worst situation possible, all the way to a man determined to win the heart of his sweetheart, Cabaret Balkan will take you on one wild ride. Despite our characters moving here and there, Balkan is one of those films that initially makes you think, That was a depressing film, but after thinking further one can still say this was a depressing film, but it worked. It makes you think about the lifestyles of the less-fortunate in these areas, it makes you consider the place and the people &#x96; transforming what happens in Belgrade and putting into modern life, no matter where you live. That is why Balkan resonates. It takes over-hyper events and somehow settles them into reality. This is not an easy task as each story shows a different side of this city, or of the human relation, but as the stories continue to blend, adding layer upon layer &#x96; Balkan becomes a stronger and stronger film.Alas, this isn't a film for everyone. Critics would argue that the inconsistent blend between the stories diminished the opportunity for authentic drama. Critics would argue that the disassociation between American audiences and what is political in Serbia would pull from the central focus. Critics would argue that not enough development of our characters hurt the overall effect of Dejan Dukovski's written word. In a small sense, they are right. Cabaret Balkan isn't without its faults, and casual film watchers would probably agree as initially this film just feels lackluster, but it is what remains in your mind long after the final credits rolled that makes this film applaud. It is a film that obviously tackled some difficult issues, in a place where difficult situations occur as the norm. The turning point for this film viewer was the story of the man trying to win his woman's heart. With orchestra and dog in hand, we follow him throughout his possible release until the climactic moment, but the eventual outcome of his sincere efforts is what shows the true horror that Balkan is trying to bring to light. My argument would be that perhaps it needed to end with this singular story, instead of the choice ending with the sadist and couple. To me, that story felt the least developed and utterly awkward. Realizing that it isn't Disney, it still felt choppy and misappropriated. As one small flaw for this film, in my eyes, would be this choppiness of getting from point A to point B. Perhaps it was the budget or just the lack of experience, but Balkan isn't subtle. The flow of scene to scene isn't there, and it demonstrates the struggles of our people (I get that), but a stronger frame to this film would have only heighted the experience.This was a decent endeavour into a world I knew very little about. It is a film that resonates long after it is over. It continues to surprise that this little independent feature still hasn't seen a DVD light of day yet. A broader audience would appreciate what our director was trying to create here.Overall, would I suggest this film to a friend or family member? I believe so. It had a strong enough messages, despite the lacking characters, and it felt fresh. It was dark, foreign, and sporadic &#x96; but it stayed consistent throughout.

But in the 1980s he was more famous for doing blockbusters like Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and the Indiana Jones series. In the mid 80s tried to change all that by making more serious, Oscar challenging films like The Colour Purple and of course, Empire of the Sun. This led to Spielberg gaining his well earn Oscar for Schindler's List.Starting in 1941, the Japanese army was getting closer to Shanghai. Many British ex-pats are starting to leave China for other British colonies. Jamie Graham (Christian Bale) is a wealth child living in a British area of the city. Jamie is a spoiled child, disrespecting his servants and lives a live of luxury. He is also smart child, who knows a lot about military aviation. When the Japanese troops finally takes Jamie and his family try and felt China. But Jamie is separated and forced to survive in the occupied city. Jamie quickly has to tie his destiny with Basie (John Malkovich), an American who ends up stuck in city, and shows himself to be resourceful, but morally, a little questionable. Jamie and Basie are captured by the Japanese, and forced to live in an internment camp. Jamie has to learn how to survive quickly.Empire of the Sun was based on the J. G. Ballard's semi-autobiographical novel, where he also had to live in Japanese occupied China. Here Spielberg shows his growing skill, working with a good script by Tom Stoppard. Spielberg tells a coming-of-age set during the horrors of war. Jamie really grows as a character, becoming a more caring character, shows how his innocence is clipped away. This is a more artist film by Spielberg with some of the scenes, aiming to put a lot of symbolism in the film. This ending up being very similar to the Soviet classic Come and See (highly recommended viewing). Spielberg shows the collapse of law and order in Shanghai, and tough conditions in a Japanese camp. But Spielberg also tries to show some balance in the film, with some Japanese characters in a more decent light, like a Japanese runaway technician.

Whilst this is a good film for the most part, there were some moments that felt a little forced and unrealistic. Spielberg also shows that he has a weak for over-sentimentality, but those moments are few and far between. The character of Mrs. Victor (Miranda Richardson) also felt very underplayed, and her part was properly cut from what was originally intended. There is a good cast.

But in the 1980s he was more famous for doing blockbusters like Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and the Indiana Jones series. In the mid 80s tried to change all that by making more serious, Oscar challenging films like The Colour Purple and of course, Empire of the Sun. This led to Spielberg gaining his well earn Oscar for Schindler's List.Starting in 1941, the Japanese army was getting closer to Shanghai. Many British ex-pats are starting to leave China for other British colonies. Jamie Graham (Christian Bale) is a wealth child living in a British area of the city. Jamie is a spoiled child, disrespecting his servants and lives a live of luxury. He is also smart child, who knows a lot about military aviation. When the Japanese troops finally takes Jamie and his family try and felt China. But Jamie is separated and forced to survive in the occupied city. Jamie quickly has to tie his destiny with Basie (John Malkovich), an American who ends up stuck in city, and shows himself to be resourceful, but morally, a little questionable. Jamie and Basie are captured by the Japanese, and forced to live in an internment camp. Jamie has to learn how to survive quickly.Empire of the Sun was based on the J. G. Ballard's semi-autobiographical novel, where he also had to live in Japanese occupied China. Here Spielberg shows his growing skill, working with a good script by Tom Stoppard. Spielberg tells a coming-of-age set during the horrors of war. Jamie really grows as a character, becoming a more caring character, shows how his innocence is clipped away. This is a more artist film by Spielberg with some of the scenes, aiming to put a lot of symbolism in the film. This ending up being very similar to the Soviet classic Come and See (highly recommended viewing). Spielberg shows the collapse of law and order in Shanghai, and tough conditions in a Japanese camp. But Spielberg also tries to show some balance in the film, with some Japanese characters in a more decent light, like a Japanese runaway technician.

Tom Cruise does enough to make comment of only because he plays an individual much against his usual character-type, and he delivers a real and powerful display.The cinematography manages to entice and enthrall the viewer in equal measure with its concerted unedited running shots and focus. The screenplay is steady, and when this is merged with the musical score the narrative flows quite nicely. However, the film prolongs its conclusion too long, you do toss and turn, and change your seating position regularly as some character arcs are not as responsive or enduring as others.Magnolia does have a lot to say, coincidence or connections being the main narrative tool. For that very reason it felt rather fancy for the film to have a prologue when it was quite explicit in Magnolia that lives were intertwined. The down-pour of frogs, a biblical reference to veer the story from the possible to the hypothetical was off-key, and much of the melancholy I believe could have been expressed in a much more cohesive structure.The best way I can describe Magnolia is as a failed attempt at greatness. It has its elements of brilliance; the screenplay really grips at times; the original use of the heartfelt song 'Wise-up' by Aimee Mann and the cast of characters is vividly memorable, the intelligent and smart cinematography and the great acting really do plant you into the world. However, the story is rather tiresome, and its running time eradicates the emotional heart of the film.
