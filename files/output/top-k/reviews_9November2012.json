[{"date":"9 November 2012","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Yes, that masked psycho with the Scream mask has returned for a third round of murderous rampaging. The first victim of his wrath is duo film survivor Cotton Weary (played by a pre X-Men Liev Schrieber) when he fails to reveal the whereabouts of the reclusive survivor, Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell)who is now hiding on an isolated estate as a crisis hot-line operator. When the murderer begins to leave pictures of Sidney's deceased mother, Sidney is soon drawn to the set of Stab 3 (based on her experiences from the previous films)alongside her fellow survivors, reporter Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox-Arquette) and retired officer Dewey Riley (David Arquette). Other players such as Parker Posey, Emily Mortimer and Scott Foley as members of the film-within-a- film join the three original cast members (with a brief cameo by Jamie Kennedy as Randy Meeks with posthumous advice to survive a trilogy). However, this third installment lacks the real scares that unnerve audiences in the first two films. You can easily predict the timing of the phone calls and the murders. If you want actual scares, then watch the first and\/or second film.

It had such great acting by both Chris Tucker and our beloved Jackie Chan! They shared such amazing chemistry and both their characters were lovable. The plot remains very basic and this is one of the strengths of this movie. Its a lot like 'Die Hard (1988)' where the plot is simply rescue the kidnapped\/hostage against overwhelming odds. The action in this film was purely amazing and the dialogue was well written. I pretty much enjoyed every aspect of this film, in particular the comedy. **SPOILERS**I, in particular laughed hard at the scene where Lee is like 'Wassup,my **** It was hilarious and the action sequence that followed was breathtaking. I also laughed hard at the scene where Lee is trying to stop any of the things being broken and then as soon as he walks away, it explodes! ***END OF SPOILERS*** Overall, highly recommend this movie to all comedy\/Jackie Chan fans!
