OK it's a movie from year 1984, great special effects at this time, but i didn't enjoy watching the movie, because lack of professional acting. By the way i read the book first, and i liked book better. Many important facts from the book, where unnoticed. I still wait for movie what completely understands the book. I played years ago computer game Dune, and there i felt like in book.I apologise for my bad English, because it's not my first language, and thats why i can't express myself the way i want. So i could continue my review in estonian, but i don't think that many people could understand it.

I've never been a subscriber to the the book was better cliché, but if you've read Frank Herbert's Dune, and enjoyed it... stay as far away from this movie as you possibly can.It's one thing to take some creative license in a book-turned-movie, but when you remove vital elements of the plot and randomly throw in new ones to cover it up (weirding modules??? what the hell?), you're just ruining the story. The Bene-Gesserit breeding plan is mentioned once at the beginning of the movie, and then completely done away with in the story. Baron Harkonnen is just some evil, insane fat man (not the despicable but cunning grandfather of Paul as in the novel). The fight between Paul and his cousin Feyd-Rautha at the end is just pointless filler with no relation to the plot. The entire portion of the story in which Paul befriends, earns the trust of, and becomes the leader of the Freman becomes he's the one from the prophecy OK let's follow him lol. Hell half of the movie doesn't even make sense unless you've read the novel, and then it's just butchered anyway.Add to the mix HORRIBLE ACTING (I don't know what you people who complimented it were thinking) and terrible special effects (standard for the 80's I suppose) and you get one steaming pile of refuse.I suppose I can't comment for those who saw the movie before the book, but even then, this is not an enjoyable movie. Maybe if you're really intoxicated. Maybe.

It will make you smile but not laugh, it will make you frown but not cry, it won't frighten the children and they will enjoy it. I'm glad I saw it on TV and did not pay to see it. Definitely made for TV and for quiet moments for adults. OK ten lines of text eh! Well it has Rik Mayell in it, he was definitely better in the Young Ones, never quite made any impact after that. Loads of potential but just something lacking, perhaps it's Adrian Edmondson, Nigel Planer, Christopher Ryan and Elxei Sayle. I watched this film with my son who I think has a VERY good memory for films and although he watched it loads on video has no recollection of it, which says quite a lot to me.
