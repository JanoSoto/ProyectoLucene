Now as soon as we get american writers to write the movies it will all be good. i also liked how they didnt kid up the movie like Episode 1 (star wars). all in all this movie is worth seeing in the threater. i still feel ripped off about shrek.

I anticipated the poor plot (hoping to be pleasantly surprised) and anticipated ground-breaking computer animation (hoping not to be disappointed).This movie was not ground-breaking.  It was not unique.  It didn't do anything new, and it didn't forge any new paths in the movie-going experience.  The characters were too few, and not consistently detailed (main characters had far more detail than minor ones).  They were animated poorly, and any scene with prolonged subtle animations (speaking, observing, etc) appeared immediately false and unbelievable.  Animated films work because they move properly.  Animation is as much an art as computer modeling, texturing models, and even making those stupid freckles and imperfections that people dwell upon.  All the freckles in the world won't make a poorly animated character look real. Many will complain that this is simply a fault of the state of technology, that currently Square pictures couldn't make as realistic a picture as they may have wanted.  That's all bogus.  Shrek was more believable, and it was an obvious cartoon.  Toy story, also believable.  Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, Snow White, Bambi.  All of these are animated films that have preceded Final Fantasy, and all of them were animated more professionally, more artisticly, and more accurately than the model actors in Final Fantasy.Ultimately, there is no excuse for this movie.  The plot was horrible (it is simply unacceptable for the plot of a ground-breaking movie to stink), and the visual element to the film, for which I paid my admission and waited over a year to see, was at points so unimpressive that I felt cheated.I could go on and on, but I'll stop here.  I am actually going to recommend this movie, because i want people to have some basis for comparison when a real movie is made (whenever that may be.  I'm still hoping for Lord of the Rings.  Dear God don't let them foul that one up too). ","genre":null},{"date":"12 July 2001","score":"","review":"  Like all of us, I wanted to like this movie.

I think the best action movie of the summer is Pearl Harbor. The movie is slightly flawed but it was a whole lot better than this. Save your money and see Shrek or Pearl Harbor instead.
