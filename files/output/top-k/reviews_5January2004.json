And it surely does, thanks to Figgis' intelligent script and direction, Cage's role as a down-and-out writer and his protracted self-destruction, and Shue's portrayal of a lonely hooker, lifting that old bromide beyond what could have been routine, to a level not seen since Jane Fonda's character in Klute. Excellent performances all around.With all that said, this film is not for everyone (in particular those who only respond to gratuitous sex, car chases, and mindless pyrotechnics). The lurid depictions of despair, self-loathing, and violence could put off even the most hardened social worker.

Hollywood rushed out a cluster of disaster films in this era designed to shock and astound audiences with massive CG inspired effects, which were vast becoming mainstream and affordable in their application of major studio films.  Each film attempted a larger, grander, direr situation for audiences to experience.  We were stuck in the middle of a tornado, (Twister) trapped underground a city, (Daylight) saw massive tsunamis wreak havoc, (Deep Impact) nearly wiped out by an asteroid (Armageddon) and found out what damage a volcanic eruption would do to LA. (Volcano)The unremarkable peers of Dante's Peak merely demonstrate why this film should not be underestimated or overlooked.  This film stands out in the pack as an intelligent, carefully paced disaster movie.The plot plays simply but effectively.  Harry Dalton (Brosnan), a US Geologist, has come to the picturesque town of Dante's Peak with a team of experts to monitor activity of its menacing volcano, which for about 3,000 years has remained silently dormant.   We know this 'sleepy' town is about to get a rude awakening.  Unfortunately for Dalton, his colleagues and most of the town think his theory of an eminent big bang is rubbish and his only believer is the town's Mayor, Rachel Wando. (Hamilton) The volcano subsequently erupts and these characters are 'in the thick of it' as they say.The surprising part of the story is the measured pace it gives the characters.  We get a long build up to the eruption, and the characters aren't rushed in their romantic moments or exposition.  We know that these characters have real lives, Dalton does field experiments on the mountain, and Wando works at her coffee shop.  The build up to the action accentuates its dramatic qualities, just as the characters aren't rushed, the audience isn't artificially forced into danger the minute the cinema lights go down.Perhaps the most intelligent aspect of the production is the casting.  The choice of Hamilton as Mayor Wando is inspired.  It is rare to see a female actor, chosen to play a romantic role opposite an attractive leading man such as Brosnan, who is over 30 and doesn't look like a variation of Barbie. Hamilton is an actor of courage and subtlety.  She knows strong characters, women who rely on themselves and their resolve to make it through. However, her intelligence is stimulating, and in Dante's Peak she gives Mayor Wando a sexy, sassy grounding in her realness and integrity.  She perfectly mirrors Brosnan, who is believable as the astute volcano expert.  It's easy to see Brosnan in any role that requires him to be heroic and say `well, that's just Bond.'  But that attitude is nonsensical.  The fact is, Brosnan has an engaging appeal to audiences, we want him to win, and we root for him and really believe this man could save the world.  No matter, not even a pair of glasses and straps hanging around his neck can make this man look ordinary. His face accounts for his knowledge.  A funny moment sees him pick up a rock and stare at it, Wando then remarks, `A man who looks at a rock must have a lot on his mind.'There is an adage about sexual tension that X Files creator Chris Carter used to say, in reference to the unresolved sexual heat between his characters, Mulder and Scully. It is the notion that if you get two intelligent people in a room together, sparks will fly. It is proved correct in Dante's Peak, and the fact that it works is testament to the talent of the two leads.Roger Donaldson is a talented Australian director who understands action and suspense.  His fourteen films to date as a director show an understanding of what makes tension on the screen.  (The Bounty, The Recruit, Thirteen Days.) The minute the volcano erupts we enter the action breathlessly and the direction of Donaldson evokes the destruction and panic in fine form.It would be easy for the story in Dante's Peak to be swept away violently by the river of lava gushing out the mountain's fiery mouth.

The 'boo' frights were terrific and many of them made me jump out of my skin. The scares work best when they are psychological and silent, or all in your head. Just imagine what this family goes through, particularly in the brilliant finale. M Night Shyamalan puts you right in their shoes and doesn't let up with the terror until the very last frame.--Is Signs a horror movie? Yes. Is it a sci-fi movie? Yes. But when it all comes down to it, what is this movie genre-wise? This movie, to me at least, was all about the tale of this family, and the strife they're going through after losing someone close to them. The father is a priest who has lost all faith and the kids prefer their father's brother. Signs is about aliens, but it's about how the alien attack affects the family and makes them bring out the love and trust they all must have in each other to survive such a horrifying ordeal. This was shown amazingly in the wonderful and tragic final dinner scene.--Mel Gibson gives one of his finest performances to date. He is a tour-de-force as Graham Hess; he sold me completely in his role. The inner turmoil the character was experiencing was so brilliantly portrayed by Gibson, during quiet, lonely moments or through big, dramatic scenes such as the aforementioned final dinner scene. Joaquin Phoenix was very strong and always believable in his supporting performance as Graham's brother Merrill. The adorable Abigail Breslin and another one of the Culkin clan, Rory Culkin, are terrific rising stars with a lot of talent at such young ages.--M Night Shyamalan continues his run of terrific writing\/directing efforts, he brings across the suspense of the situations in the film seamlessly, and injects a lot of emotion into the film. The strange and subtle camera movements and angles were also much appreciated.  THE BAD--I must warn that this section of my review has nothing more, nothing less than THE BIGGEST SPOILERS FOR SIGNS.

This question is what would the world be like with out me? The answer for this question is explored through the main character that because of his lack of achevements in his life feels that he has done more harm then good. This movie could be divided up into three parts the first part is when he is a child the second part is when he is an adult but a younger adult and the last part is when he is an older adult.This movie is about a man who thinks that because he didn't do any thing he wanted to do when he was a kid that his life is a failed one. This movie follows him from when he was just a child up until he wants to commits suicide in when he is about thirty or forty years old. The movie does this in a rather clever way by an angel telling the story of his life to another angel that is to protect George Baily from himself. The viewers first introduction to George is when he is just a child and is sleding in this scene George's brother falls through the ice, George jumps in after him and save his life. This scene was done to introduce something the George that was good and that at the end of the movie would be brought up. The next scene is George a little older and he is at work talking to two girls about what he wants to do when he is older. It apears from this scene that George has a great imagination and also at this early age he relises that he doesn't want to stay in his home town. This scene also is one that ties in to the end for in this scene George prevents his boss from delivering pills that were inadvertently poisoned. Scene continue like this for a little while showing good things that he did and expanding on his dreams.When he s a younger adult he is confronted with a problem, either he goes off and lives his dream and fathers life work and the last chance most of the people in his town to live a decent life goes down the drain or he can stay and work a job that he hates in a town he has wanted out of since he was just a young boy and help those people in his town who need it and further his fathers work. This decision does not come easily to him though he makes it time and again. He ends up helping hundreds of people in his town start business and build houses much to the dissatisfaction of the villain of this movie who is a greedy stubborn old man who would not give loans to any of the people that George and even if he did the people would not be able to afford them. George is given several opportunities to get out of his town and to leave his job but chooses to help his family and friends instead.The third part of this movie is when George is on the verge of committing suicide and is saved by his gaurdian angel and is shown how the world would be with out him. The scene of the world without him is not a pretty one all his friends are poor and have horrible lives and his brother whom he saved as a young boy is dead drowned at the age of eight. George is greatly affected by this vision and changes his out look on life. He is now happy about the choices that he has made and acts as if he wouldn't change them even if he could.

The viewers first introduction to George is when he is just a child and is sleding in this scene George's brother falls through the ice, George jumps in after him and save his life. This scene was done to introduce something the George that was good and that at the end of the movie would be brought up. The next scene is George a little older and he is at work talking to two girls about what he wants to do when he is older. It apears from this scene that George has a great imagination and also at this early age he relises that he doesn't want to stay in his home town. This scene also is one that ties in to the end for in this scene George prevents his boss from delivering pills that were inadvertently poisoned. Scene continue like this for a little while showing good things that he did and expanding on his dreams.When he s a younger adult he is confronted with a problem, either he goes off and lives his dream and fathers life work and the last chance most of the people in his town to live a decent life goes down the drain or he can stay and work a job that he hates in a town he has wanted out of since he was just a young boy and help those people in his town who need it and further his fathers work. This decision does not come easily to him though he makes it time and again. He ends up helping hundreds of people in his town start business and build houses much to the dissatisfaction of the villain of this movie who is a greedy stubborn old man who would not give loans to any of the people that George and even if he did the people would not be able to afford them. George is given several opportunities to get out of his town and to leave his job but chooses to help his family and friends instead.The third part of this movie is when George is on the verge of committing suicide and is saved by his gaurdian angel and is shown how the world would be with out him. The scene of the world without him is not a pretty one all his friends are poor and have horrible lives and his brother whom he saved as a young boy is dead drowned at the age of eight. George is greatly affected by this vision and changes his out look on life. He is now happy about the choices that he has made and acts as if he wouldn't change them even if he could.

This question is what would the world be like with out me? The answer for this question is explored through the main character that because of his lack of achevements in his life feels that he has done more harm then good. This movie could be divided up into three parts the first part is when he is a child the second part is when he is an adult but a younger adult and the last part is when he is an older adult.This movie is about a man who thinks that because he didn't do any thing he wanted to do when he was a kid that his life is a failed one. This movie follows him from when he was just a child up until he wants to commits suicide in when he is about thirty or forty years old.

The story only gets more entertaining as the mystery continues to unravel and by the end you will be satisfied and feel a sense of closure on the series.--Like the previous two films, Scream 3 maintains interest and is constantly entertaining, and therefore has a consistent rewatchability factor. I love watching this film and have done so many times, because it is entertaining. And that's a great Scream tradition!--Scream 3 is probably the funniest of the Scream films. The Parker Posey\/Courteney Cox-Arquette bantering was the most enjoyable; Posey in particular is a hoot and a half playing her over-the-top character. This instalment also has neat little comedic additions to it, especially the cameos, which are very enjoyable. Jay and Silent Bob were great, as was Carrie Fisher. Fisher particularly gets her justice in a hilarious scene.--The final instalment to the Scream series advances on the chase-stab-kill routine, giving us a few more original death scenes. I loved the mirror death, the explosion and the high-speed chase especially.THE BAD--The first two films were very gory and bloody, yet Scream 3 has toned it down quite a lot. We get hardly any blood and the killings aren't very graphic.--Neve Campbell gives a strong performance and Sidney is an interesting character still, yet it is my opinion that she doesn't have enough screen time.

Their pranks escalate to open warfare, and you learn that this is not the first time they've crossed swords over a woman. Who will win?Another superb performance by cinema's quintessential odd couple. The love-hate relationship between Lemmon and Matthau is just sincere enough to be touching, and just mean-spirited enough to be hilarious.

I have not read W. Somerset Maugham's novel, nor have seen the first one that preceded the film.Frankly, 'The Razor's Edge' is a terrible, horrendous, awful 'arthouse drama' movie, if not the worst movie ever to attempt at 'being serious' of a drama expected from well-made drama movies in terms of wasted resources and labor that went to the production of the movie realistically set in the early 20th century (about the only redeeming quality of the film I could say). I have no problem accepting Bill Murray taking a serious and risky role (I have yet to see Sofia Coppola's 'Lost in Translation' at the time I submit this comment), but this was a bad career move for Bill. Same could be said for Jim Carrey who took the risk and did quite well in 'The Truman Show' but 'The Majestic' an altogether different story. Bill tried his best at usual deadpan humor expected of him as a comedic actor and he comes off too stoic, somber, subpar, pompous and desperate.I wonder what the heck were adaptation writer\/director John Byrum and co-writer\/actor Bill Murray smoking when they attempted to make The Razor's Edge. Is their adapted version of the novel about enlightenment? Pursuing the simplicity of life? Poking fun of the rich? Preaching compassion and kindness? Sarcastic insight on hypocrisy, vanity and drudgery? From trying to stay awake viewing the film in one-sitting, it's apparent they did not have focus on these points and instead drag the whole film with lame, tedious and awful dialogues in scene after scene concerning the supporting characters' problems in contrived and cartoonish depiction and how Bill Murray's protagonist is a saint compared to Forrest Gump and Patch Adams. Hal Ashby's 1979 film 'Being There' accomplished the points I laid out above. Peter Sellers' swan song portrayal of Chance the Gardener was the saint compared to the impostering likes of Bill Murray's Larry Darrell and Tom Hanks's Forrest Gump.Apparently, Bill, John and the film producers were trying too hard to make the best Oscar bait movie to come along in the history of the 80's cinema, with them envisioning sweeping movie award ceremonies with the 'masterpiece' they produced. 'The Razor's Edge' failed at the box office not because of the audience's dashed expectation of Bill Murray's risky acting attempt at drama and utter apathy, but simply because the film is deadlier slow-paced, slothful, pointless, frustrating, wholly incoherent, disjointed and dreadful wallowing in Oscar-winning-conscious self-importance pretending to be a top-notch quality serious drama movie. In summary, 'The Razor's Edge' is an ideal cure for insomnia.  1\/2 out of **** stars ","genre":null},{"date":"5 January 2004","score":"4 out of 12 people found the following review useful","review":"  Normally I'm a self-professed arthouse snob who likes to watch slow-paced films that are truly well-written and directed, but this film purported to be a serious drama starring Bill Murray is horrible beyond belief in terms of its deadly lethargic pacing and consistently pointless dialogue scenes with the ensemble cast who tried their best to naturally perform but come off as superficial and contrived. I have not read W. Somerset Maugham's novel, nor have seen the first one that preceded the film.Frankly, 'The Razor's Edge' is a terrible, horrendous, awful 'arthouse drama' movie, if not the worst movie ever to attempt at 'being serious' of a drama expected from well-made drama movies in terms of wasted resources and labor that went to the production of the movie realistically set in the early 20th century (about the only redeeming quality of the film I could say). I have no problem accepting Bill Murray taking a serious and risky role (I have yet to see Sofia Coppola's 'Lost in Translation' at the time I submit this comment), but this was a bad career move for Bill. Same could be said for Jim Carrey who took the risk and did quite well in 'The Truman Show' but 'The Majestic' an altogether different story. Bill tried his best at usual deadpan humor expected of him as a comedic actor and he comes off too stoic, somber, subpar, pompous and desperate.I wonder what the heck were adaptation writer\/director John Byrum and co-writer\/actor Bill Murray smoking when they attempted to make The Razor's Edge. Is their adapted version of the novel about enlightenment? Pursuing the simplicity of life? Poking fun of the rich? Preaching compassion and kindness? Sarcastic insight on hypocrisy, vanity and drudgery? From trying to stay awake viewing the film in one-sitting, it's apparent they did not have focus on these points and instead drag the whole film with lame, tedious and awful dialogues in scene after scene concerning the supporting characters' problems in contrived and cartoonish depiction and how Bill Murray's protagonist is a saint compared to Forrest Gump and Patch Adams.
