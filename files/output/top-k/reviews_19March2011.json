With the movie almost divided into two subplots, the race to finish Cochrane's ship and the fight against the Borg, the movie contains both what is best with Star Trek. The sense of exploration and pure sci-fi action. And Frakes, in his role as director, handles the two plots very well. They interact without getting in each other's way, which is the tricky part. First Contact is simply entertaining from beginning to end.A key part is the cast. The crew of the Enterprise is very good as always, but it is almost Cromwell's depiction of the legendary Cochrane that makes the movie.

The film host a tremendous amounts of Hollywood talent notably; John Travolta, Samuel Jackson, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Harvey Keitel and even a brief cameo by Christopher Walken. The Hollywood star power comes together to create a very unique filmed based on the very bizarre lives of a couple hit men, a boxer, a man who takes care of problems and a mob boss and his wife.Pulp Fiction is a very dark humored film that focuses on the misadventures of several seemingly unrelated characters whose attempts to resolve issues in their bizarre worlds only to find themselves even deeper into trouble. Sam Jackson and John Travolta know in the film as Vincent Vega and Jules are a couple of hit men who carry on very humorous banter about such worldly items such as how Big Mac's are referred to in London. The banter between Vega and Jules adds to the dark motif of the film as the characters are presented in a very likable light even after they execute a man.One of the most significant characteristic of the film has very little to do with the actual characters but yet instead is on the way the film is edited. Bucking traditional movie flow Tarantino starts the movie with a scene from the end of the film. Much like the Tarantino film Reservoir Dogs the film jumps forward and backward at will and introduces characters throughout the film that seemingly has not tied in to each other or the plot if they ever do at all.While the film is set in relatively modern times in California the movie has a very old fashioned feel to it. The costumes worn throughout the film are dated to the seventies, Vega and Marcellus' wife go to an old fashioned shake and burger shop and the film's soundtrack also creates a retro vibe throughout the film. The dark theme that I mentioned early in the dialogue and action is carried forward in the lighting throughout much of the film.The dark vibe of the film however is clearest seen in the scene sequence where Marcellus and Butch who are held hostage in the basement of a red neck gun store. The lighting in this scene is very dark as it is in an old basement. A character is dressed in an all black gimp suit and Marcellus is taken off screen and sexually assaulted by the redneck store owner. While this event all takes place off screen the sounds creates a horrible visual image of the abuse going on.The Movie Pulp Fiction is a fantastic movie both in regards to entertainment and cinematic value. The movie creates suspense in the way it is edit and scenes are shown out of order and the dialogue is very witty and entertaining in a very dark and humorous way. This film is by far the best that I have ever seen of all Tarantino creations.

William Holden is perfect and dashing and manly and All American in the lead and top billed star. Jennifer Jones-looking beautiful- plays an Eurasian doctor who falls for a married man. Expert camera work by 20th ace Leon Shamroy and great set design. ( Hong Kong in those days was an isolated area adjacent to the then Red China and had a mystery all to itself. The back story of this movie is that William Holden adored by his co stars one of which Barbara Stanwyck made a truly moving and memorable reference to her golden boy when she was awarded an Honorary Oscar, William Holden was a real ladies man and co starred with Susan Hayward, Kim Novak, Sophia Loren, Lucille Ball, Judy Holiday and had affairs with co stars Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly and Capucine but when it came to Jennifer Jones, Holden and Jennifer did not get along at all in real life, Hard to believe because the chemistry of the two stars is so apparent on the screen.The ending of the film is memorable and Ms. Jones received Her 5th Oscar nomination. William Holden should have been nominated as well.

Mr. Hope masquerades as a fearless Indian fighter wedded to Ms. Russell as a government agent. Possibly the film's comedy highlight ends when Hope nearly kisses a Native American chief on laughing gas. At least, it's the film's least lifeless scene. In a surprisingly inept dub, thanks to the star's own laughable instrumental accompaniment, Hope sings Livingston and Evans' classic Buttons and Bows which became a huge million-selling #1 hit for Dinah Shore. At the time, audiences were ripe for Technicolor and a western spoof. In the 1940s, they seemed to always be in the mood for Hope, and The Paleface helped make him Quigley Publications #1 box office star for 1949.**** The Paleface (12\/24\/48) Norman Z.
