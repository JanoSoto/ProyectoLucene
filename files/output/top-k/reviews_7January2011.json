[{"date":"7 January 2011","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Having watched the film adaptation of The World According to Garp&#x97; perhaps John Irving's most well known novel&#x97;I was unconvinced that the epic scope of the Dickensian author's writing could be appropriately translated to film. Just hours after finishing The Cider House Rules&#x97; superior to Garp, in my opinion&#x97;I decided to watch the film. Its Oscar- winning, Irving-scripted screenplay, I reasoned, was about the only chance I had of being convinced otherwise.The Cider House rules follows the story of the unadoptable orphan Homer Wells. Trained in obstetrics by the orphanage founder and ether addict Dr Wilbur Larch, Homer grows up being told that he must be of use. When a young couple comes in search of Larch's less legal form of delivery, the now adult orphan is motivated to return home with them to experience life outside the orphanage.What I like&#x97;nay, love&#x97;about Irving's writing is its comprehensiveness the encompassing, breathtaking scale of how he writes. His novels often follow characters from youth to old age; from birth to death; from one extreme to t'other. The book-to-film transition is one of the most difficult jumps to make between media, and one which so rarely works to create a brilliant offspring. But enough of that for now. The Cider House Rules about which I write is the film, and must be judged as such. The beginning offers us a quick introduction to life at the St Cloud's Orphanage and to Homer Wells and his mentor, harried ever so slightly by the irritating and mawkishly sentimental music which floats at the threshold of audibility&#x97;it's so cliché as to be emetic. This is a minor problem however in the face of Michael Caine's performance&#x97;the cause of the film's well deserved second Oscar; the way in which he masks his distinctive accent alone is fascinating. The scenes of the emotional Caine are clearly the best the film has to offer, his quiet moments of breakdown genuinely quite moving. Unfortunately much of the film is spent away from St Cloud's, dealing with Homer's budding romance with Candy. The relationship never seems quite as complex or well-explored as it could be, doing little to really draw the audience into it. Little in the film is especially captivating, just barely hanging onto our attention as it lightly brushes themes and topics without ever really doing much with any of these. It remains consistently interesting, but never anything much more. Ultimately, this film suffers the same fate as the film version of Garp in attempting to bring a wide-ranging comprehensive story to the big screen, it loses the thematic and character depth of the source material. Whilst it does a fair job of exploring the rules with which we govern ourselves&#x97;the crucial cornerstone of the novel&#x97;it feels somehow incomplete. And despite the wonder of Caine's performance, his Larch is never so engrossing as the one on paper.Never boring, but never compelling, The Cider House Rules turns a fantastic novel into a just-better-than-mediocre film. Strong performances nevertheless and a touch of the book's important message give something of a positive spin however. Doing nothing so much as highlighting the gross differences betwixt the two media, it proves further to me that Irving is inherently unfilmable.

Bringing some of the greatest actors together Urma Thurman, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, Christopher Walken & Ving Rhames. Having solid actors really pushes the films to it's greatest limits.For some minor things, including the retarded rape scene with the cop and I wish Urma & Smauel L. Jackson should be in the film a bit more. i'll go through all the positive things about the film.Dialogue, 10\/10 The dialogue was hilarious and at times very powerful and the swearing was over the top which I loved.Storyline, 9\/10 The plot was very stylish and very easy to catch all the time and I like the flash moment back at the start. SO I think that deserves tremendous credit.Acting, 10\/10 Do i need to say anymore, it was freakin fantastic.Scenes, 10\/10 Everything about this film is really great and all the scenes (except for the rape scene) excellent and well executed. Most of the time I found the scenes really funny and for good reason, for e.g. I found the $5 milk shake or the story of a watch, lol. Even the action is compelling.Everything is well stable in this film and I highly recommend this to anyone who hasn't watched this yet.
