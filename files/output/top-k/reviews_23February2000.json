When I saw this movie, I went into the movie theater with the highest of expectations.  I loved Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights and Hard Eight, so I naturally expected I would love this movie too.  But instead, Magnolia was the biggest letdown I have experienced at the movies all year.  I seriously felt angry when I left the theater.What really gets my goat is that everyone whose opinions about movies that I respect seems to have taken a shine to this horrendous movie.  Oh, and then there are those people who say that anyone who didn't like Magnolia obviously didn't get it.  Trust me, I got Magnolia....I just didn't like what I got.The movie was well-acted by the whole cast.  I especially liked Melora Walters, John C. Reilly, Julianne Moore, and Tom Cruise.  But all their talents were wasted here, because the movie was so poorly written.  Paul Thomas Anderson was simply trying too hard to make the viewers give a damn about his characters.  Also, some of the characters could have been eliminated completely.  Did we really need William H. Macy's character? And not one but TWO fathers dying of cancer?  Maybe Earl Partridge (Jason Robards) and Jimmy Gator (Philip Baker Hall) could have been made into a single character.The movie was much too long and drawn out for its own good, too.  Don't get me wrong.  I am not afraid of long movies, or movies with an ensemble cast, but Magnolia was done in by both its length and its numerous characters and storylines.  Magnolia could have been a better movie if P.T. Anderson had spent more than five minutes in the editing room.  As I was watching this movie, I kept hoping it would get better (not a good sign), but it only got worse.  This movie just lacked cohesion, and the fact that it was three hours long didn't help.And what was the purpose of the music?  The background music never stopped and it drowned out dialogue at times.  i thought it worked in the very last shot of the movie....but not for the WHOLE THING! Instead of enhancing the drama, it took away from it.The sing-along scene was laughably bad.  And I don't even want to go into the frog plague.  Was that P.T. Anderson's attempt at being surreal? It sabotaged the movie, as far as I am concerned.  Many people consider it original and audacious.  I just consider it as the excess of all excesses this movie hurls at the audience. Paul Thomas Anderson has got some nerve.

Everyone rabbits on about how great Coppola's `Dracula' looks, for instance; yet one hears very little about `Frankenstein', which makes `Dracula' look like the hideous, cheesy patchwork quilt that it is.  A similar injustice is done to `Much Ado About Nothing' and `In the Bleak Midwinter'.  `Hamlet', too, offers absorbing views well worth staring at (and that didn't cost nearly as much as they look as though they did).  The `get the to a nunnery' scene, in a hall of mirrors, is technically dazzling.  I gather it was a nightmare to shoot.But every so often the sure touch fails.  The scene in which Hamlet meets the ghost of his father is risible, unworthy of the big screen, certainly unworthy of most of the rest of the film.  And as much as I enjoyed the art direction at the time I now wonder about the basic idea.  `Hamlet' has been re-set in the nineteenth century.  Instead of a grim stone castle we have a glittering palace out of Hans Christian Andersen - the advantage being that the throne of Denmark now looks like something worth fighting for.  But surely the same effect could have been achieved without altering the setting?  When Branagh made `Much Ado About Nothing', for instance, he did not explicitly deny Shakespeare's setting; he simply resorted to fantasy whenever he wanted an effect would have been anachronistic had the setting been realistically represented.  Perhaps Branagh thought that too much fantasy is unbecoming a drama.  If so, he was wrong.Also, although Branagh's `nothing but the best for Shakespeare's finest play' approach results in something truly special and captivating (I can't stress this enough), I can't help but find the film a little soulless.

I just found the film poorly executed. The washed out colors was particularly annoying to me. The absolute stupidity of some of the characters was beyond belief.The alien like monsters that could fly were acceptably competent as sinister adversaries but the story was extremely plodding and there were not enough scary scenes. The cinematography was not very well done. There was grade B movie dialogue executed poorly and with an accent of some sort. The special effect that you saw when the creatures were viewing the victims was tiresome and cheesy. Before people knew what an eclipse was here on earth they thought the end of the world as they knew it had happened. In this film even though most of the characters died at the hands of the malevolent creatures I still felt it was boring in comparison with other films of this genre.

Elodie Bouchez and Natacha Regnier never appear to be acting at all.  Not much happens in this movie, but its observations about friendship, social class, self-perception, and outlooks really say a lot.The scene in which Marie (Regnier) jumps out of the window to her death still resonates.  It was so unexpected and shocking, yet it fit into the movie perfectly.  She wasn't just killing herself because she was jilted by Chriss (Gregoire Colin).  She was genuinely dissatisfied with her life.Another thing about The Dreamlife of Angels that I loved a lot was the way it presented Isa's and Marie's outlooks on life as polar opposites.  And we see an overlapping and convergence of their outlooks. In the movie, Marie calls Isa a dreamer just because Isa has an optimistic worldview.  This is actually very ironic, because in the end, it is Marie who is the dreamer. She longs for a better, more substantial life with Chriss, the spoiled rich boy.  She only ends up deluding herself, and this distracts her from appreciating what life is all about.Isa (Bouchez), on the other hand, is the more realistic of the two.  While she may not be as cynical as Marie, she at least has both feet on the ground.  She never appears dissatisfied with her station in life.  She simply takes the good with the bad.

As I was talking to a friend of mine who is a literature major, we both agreed that Irving had a lot of good ideas, BUT his execution of them sucked. I've always found him too wordy, too meandering, and too coma-inducing to be considered interesting (and I've read more classics in the last five years than I did the entire time I went to high school). So, this said, it would have to be Tim Burton who would get Irving's most famous tale right.While I'm not a fanatical Burton follower, I do have a great deal of respect for his craft and films that many of his detractors lack and I think that I can safely say that this is probably the most serious film of his that I have ever seen. That may sound strange considering the fantastical elements of this story, but unlike previous Burton efforts (and I include the original Batman on this list), Sleepy Hollow feels more grounded in reality, even if more than a few historical liberties were taken. The mystery of the decaptations, which I expected would be rather quickly resolved (after all, practically everybody in America knows who did it, right?), surprisingly turned out to be central to the plot, which I felt was a good move to give the story a solid backbone. However, it is not a mystery in the traditional sense that the audience can figure out the clues with the detective. Burton does drop a few subtle hints that you're likely to miss because THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTS YOU TO DO. It seemed to me as though he wanted the audience to follow Ichabod's thinking, deductions, and conclusions rather than veer off on their own, thereby adding to the shock when the real culprit is revealed. Such a style requires subtle, painstaking work and it's to Burton's credit that, in my case at least, he succeeded.For all it's decaptations, blood, and somber atmosphere, the story does take a few Burtonesque touchs of humor that you can't help but at least smile at. My favorite has to be during the flashback to the Horseman's death (played with over-the-top relish by Christopher Walken). The Horseman makes a shushing sound to the two little blonds he runs into. One of them promptly snaps a branch to get his pursuers' attention. You have to see it to believe it. Another good one is when Nesmith asks Ichabod, Is he dead? Ichabod's logical but funny reply That's the trouble. He was dead to begin with. There are a lot of others but I won't reveal any more. Rest assured, though, they are there.Now as to the main cast, what can I say about Johnny Depp (positive or negative) that hasn't been said before? I will say that he is one of my favorite off-beat film actors (still love his stuff in Ed Wood) and his portrayal of Constable Ichabod Crane (no, you haven't wandered into the wrong movie; that's one of the changes that was added on early) is perhaps one of the most unlikely anti-heroes ever shot on film. A prim and proper shell of a man driven by reason and science, burnt by anguish over a very nasty childhood, Crane brings to mind Sherlock Holmes minus the nerves of steel (his teaming with young Nesmith would seem to verify this observation). This has to be the only movie that I've ever seen where the hero faints more often than the heroine. Speaking of said heroine, Christini Ricci admittedly does not have much to work with, but she infuses what she has with commendable skill. Perhaps one of the reasons for the minimalist screen time\/performance was to increase the uncertainty about her true nature. As to what that might be...I'm not going to tell you. Though his name isn't mentioned often, I honestly feel that Casper Van Dien, considering what I have seen of his mediocre acting skills, was born to play the part of the brave but brainless Bram Bones. His best moment has to be his fight with the Horseman (a piece of macabre comedy that Buster Keaton could have admired).The only other thing I've left to add about the film is that it is best that you pay attention to every detail, major or minor, during the movie.

I liked all of the other films, but this one was just not the same.The other three films had a very creepy environment to them and depended on suspense to scare you.  The third one was not at all suspenseful and the only thing scary about Alien³ was that it actually appealed to people.This movie had lots of grotesque scenes which were not needed to make the movie's point.  For instance, who wants to see or hear a little girls chest ripped open to search for an alien?  And who wants to see an alien jump out of a dog's stomach?I suppose you should see this movie if you liked the other films.  The only reason I say this is because it makes the series complete.  You have to be able to say you saw the entire Alien series.

(Aside  I wonder what the writers did with the other 23 hours the day this one was written?)I bought this movie (thankfully at a discount) upon a couple of pseudo-recommendations that it was cute or a good date movie.  I'm 30 years old and married, so I thought that might be a nice one to watch with my wife.  I'm now convinced that this movie was written BY teens, FOR teens. It should have had an NC18+ rating  not suitable for anyone over 18.The only thing that surprised me about the ending was that I was still watching it.  I'll tip my hat to Freddie in the lead role.  He may get type-cast in the cool student body president role, but he plays it well enough.  I believed it (although student body presidents don't actually wield any authority to boss other students around).  Rachael is cute enough for this role, but even the dork version of her early in the movie wouldn't be a dork in any high school I remember.I also found the plot conveniently skipping along when it had to set up future scenes (e.g. Zach has issues about choosing a college, or rather choosing his father's college).  It took just 2 minutes to throw this in so he could relate better to Rachael's character.  (See, I can't even remember who she was?!)The profanity, while probably typical for today's high school crowd, didn't have to be a part of this movie.  Profanity and a cute date movie won't ever go hand-in-hand in my book.About two-thirds into the movie, I was already wondering who I could give this video away to, because I don't believe I'll need to ever see it again. If you have to rent it, rent it, but you've been warned that this is nothing more than Saved By The Bell on steroids.
