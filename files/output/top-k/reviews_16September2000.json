Usual Suspects is one of the greatest movies ever (I think) and it was incredibly successful considering the director and writer had basically no experience. So where could McQuarrie go from there? He'll probably always be labeled as The Usual Suspects Guy.

He refuses to conform to the status quo and make his criminals sympathetic characters; no noble-criminal bull, Parker and Longbaugh are totally worthless human beings without a single redeeming characteristic. The acting is good (Juliette Lewis is especially great as the pregnant woman). While this is not the first-ever kidnapping-gone-wrong movie ever made, it does treat the material in a new way. McQuarrie also shot the movie very well, and much of it has the visual qualities of a Western (harsh lighting, bright sunlight, gritty desert landscape, etc). The plot is a little hard to follow at a couple points, and the ending is a little unclear. For the most part, the writing is great, but there just wasn't enough of it. (A good part of the movie is a huge action-packed finale that doesn't really use dialogue.)And even though the individual aspects of it were done well, they were sort of floating around, disjointed. The movie was lacking something to bring it all together a defining characteristic that leaves a distinct impression with you as you exit the theater. The best movies have this. For Pulp Fiction it was the absurdity of everything, for The Usual Suspects it was the Keyser Soze revelation. I don't think McQuarrie's heart was really in this.17\/20P.S.

Johnny Clay (Sterling Hayden) is fresh out of Alcatraz after five years, and immediately goes to work on a job he figures to be worth upwards of two million dollars.  He puts together a gang who are not real criminals, just `Some guys with problems and a little larceny in them.'  Marvin (Jay C. Flippen) is good for some front money Johnny needs; George (Elisha Cook Jr.) is a cashier at the track, and Mike (Joe Sawyer) is a bartender there; Randy (Ted de Corsia) is a cop with loan shark payment problems.  Clay's got it all figured out, a precision plan that can't go wrong as long as everyone does his part and keeps quiet about it, before and after.  But George has a wife, Sherry (Marie Windsor), who wants nice things, and he can't resist the temptation to let her know it's all going to get better real soon.  Trouble is, Sherry has a boyfriend, Val (Vince Edwards), who has more than a little larceny in him, as well.  As it is with all `perfect' plans, there are, after all, imperfections. \tThe presentation of this film is not one of them, however;  Kubrick keeps the tension high throughout, working with a tight narrative and an out of sequence chronology through which he dispenses bits of information, building the suspense, until it all fits together in the end like pieces of a giant puzzle (Much the same as Tarantino would do with `Pulp Fiction' many years later).  The stoic delivery, coupled with the stark black and white photography of the film, creates an almost surreal, fatalistic ambience that works so well with this material; especially at the end, for it underscores the climax and heightens the drama of the final moment, all of which makes for a truly unforgettable scene.   \tThe supporting cast includes Coleen Gray (Fay), Kola Awariani (Maurice), Joe Turkel (Tiny), and Timothy Carey, who makes his detached and indifferent hit man, Nikki Arane, one of the most memorable characters in the film.  It must be noted, however, that Elisha Cook Jr. gives what may have been his best performance ever, here.  His scene, after it all goes bad for him and he stumbles into his apartment, bullet holes in his face and wide-eyed with acceptance, to confront Sherry, is so cool and underplayed that it becomes one of the lasting impressions of the movie. \tKubrick wrote the screenplay (with some help from Jim Thompson with the dialogue), adapted from the novel `Clean Break' by Lionel White.  `The Killing' is one of Kubrick's earliest and best films; and it's not just for Kubrick fans or for those who love the `noir' genre.

The astronauts crash down onto mars, and walk around the red desert as out-of-place nature flute music plays. They find a fellow astronaut who has been marooned there for almost a year.  He has been using his computer to study the pattern of sounds coming from under the ground, and somehow (don't ask)  he records these sounds on a graph and learns they form the DNA double helix.  Since simple music communication was already done in Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind, I guess the producers felt they had to come up with something REALLY tricky for this.  The DNA graph is not complete, so the astronauts respond with the proper tones to complete the DNA and this opens a magical doorway.        The astronauts step onto the set of THX 1138, where everything is bright white nothingness, but then another doorway is opened. They step into a flashy planetarium.    I must admit I felt some suspense as I was wondering how the heck the movie would end, but the wannabe-profound feel of the next scene was really lame.  The humans meet a martian, who says nothing but shows them a three dimensional history film indicating that martians left mars to start a new life on Earth.  Upon seeing this, one character says They're us.  We're them, and they're us.  This is supposed to sound VERY DEEP, but it doesn't succeed.  This is the payoff for having sat through the previous hour of garbage?  I can almost see how this movie was started.  A bunch of studio execs sitting around  Hey, there haven't been many space movies lately.  Let's make one!      Anyway, the crew head back to their spaceship while one of the guys sticks around with the martian.  He wants to stay on the martian spacecraft to go on to some other world.        The alien ship takes off, and the human spaceship also takes off.  Of course, as they shoot across the galaxy the humans look through the window and can see their buddy shooting off to some other world.  And then the words The End actually appear on the screen.

I just like their next two films in the series (First Contact and Insurrection) better. However I did find much to like about Generations. The film begins with the christening of a new Enterprise ship. Old timers Kirk (William Shatner), Scotty (James Doohan), and Chekov (Walter Koenig) are the guests of honor at the event. The ship soon heads out into space and shortly thereafter into trouble. A solar ribbon called the Nexus nearly destroys the ship but the damage it does causes one major casualty. The film then zips ahead 78 years later to the current crew of the Starship Enterprise headed by Capt. Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart). Their introduced in a most awkward way (on a boat that looks like something from the past but has futuristic elements). Then they get up into their real ship (the U.S.S. Enterprise, of course), and discover that the same ribbon that appears at the beginning of the film (the Nexus) is about to pass by again. The villainous Dr. Soran (Malcolm McDowell), who was rescued from that earlier disaster, has a plan to destroy a star and get into the Nexus which is like being inside joy. This plot is kind of silly and it's made sillier by McDowell's performance. This is not one of the best villains in the series. But the special effects are very good, the music score is excellent, and there are many entertaining moments throughout. Stewart is good as Picard and would be even better in First Contact and Insurrection. Jonathan Frakes (Riker), Brent Spiner (Data), LeVar Burton (LaForge), Michael Dorn (Worf), Gates McFadden (Crusher), and Marina Sirtis (Troi) all do an acceptable job in their first big screen outing (and, like Stewart, would get better in the next two films). Star Trek Generations is a sci-fi\/adventure that runs hot and cold but there's enough good things in it for me to recommend the film.

And the result is a good but not great adventure; their weakest so far. It's not real bad, but this film is overlong and runs a little slow at times. I just like their next two films in the series (First Contact and Insurrection) better. However I did find much to like about Generations. The film begins with the christening of a new Enterprise ship. Old timers Kirk (William Shatner), Scotty (James Doohan), and Chekov (Walter Koenig) are the guests of honor at the event. The ship soon heads out into space and shortly thereafter into trouble. A solar ribbon called the Nexus nearly destroys the ship but the damage it does causes one major casualty. The film then zips ahead 78 years later to the current crew of the Starship Enterprise headed by Capt. Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart). Their introduced in a most awkward way (on a boat that looks like something from the past but has futuristic elements). Then they get up into their real ship (the U.S.S. Enterprise, of course), and discover that the same ribbon that appears at the beginning of the film (the Nexus) is about to pass by again. The villainous Dr. Soran (Malcolm McDowell), who was rescued from that earlier disaster, has a plan to destroy a star and get into the Nexus which is like being inside joy.

It's okay. It plays with the busted gold heist, gives the star a wisecracking urban adorability, and holds the audience interest through the end. It's heavy on the high tech, illegal surveillance angle. I lost count of the number of monitors the feds have as they track the Jamie Foxx character, so I hope they got a good deal at Circuit City. The movie does a lot with a little. For instance, in the first scene, we see Jamie Foxx and a friend about to rob a seafood warehouse for a couple of thousand dollars. Foxx makes a point to his friend -soon to be a coward- that they aren't hitting a shrimp joint. They're prawns. Foxx gets a lot of mileage from that exchange. Jamie Foxx is quite funny with the faces and the one-liners. However, it means the film is flipping between semi-comedy and murder\/thriller styles. That's hard to do. The suspense of the film is compromised by one thing. The tension of the last half-hour is based on the threat that the mastermind of the gold heist will kill Jamie Foxx's girlfriend and baby. It became clear to me early there was no way she and the baby were going to die, so that punctured the anxiety the movie wanted as a timebomb ticks down to the inevitable explosion. Finally, the ending of the film is preposterous. You don't see it coming, but when it comes, it's beyond my capacity for belief. Given the fact that the gold heist was busted, it's hard to understand how in the world the film's conclusion could have been arranged when the bank robbers were clearly in a state of confusion and duress. It's an attractive conclusion, shot with an aerial perspective, but it wasn't supported by the facts in evidence. I think Hitchcock or somebody like him said you have to design a film so it's immune to refrigerator logic. That's when the viewer of the movie gets home, decides to grab a bite, and when he is at the fridge, he thinks about the film, There's no way that could happen. That's the ending.Still, it's a good action film, it goes by quickly, it has a few laughs, and the photography is very good. Ebert was right, three stars.

Against the wishes of her father, Bill (John Goodman), but with his acquiescent approval, Violet (Perabo) begins her quest and soon learns what every aspiring newcomer to show business discovers  It's tough out there.  Soon, in order to pay the rent and keep the dream alive, on a tip she seeks employment in a bar called Coyote Ugly; the owner, Lil (Maria Bello) lets her `audition (work one night)' to see if she can handle their kind of action.  It's a tough gig, but Violet knows she's going to have to make certain sacrifices if she's to succeed.  And that is really what this movie is all about  Personal character, having the tenacity to maintain ideals and dignity, and deciding what and how much one must be willing to sacrifice to achieve one's goals; and most importantly, having enough heart to see it all through. \tPerabo gives a winning performance as Violet; she's fresh, somewhat naive (but not entirely), and the way she presents her character makes it easy to connect with her right away.  She becomes someone you care about quickly, and there are moments early on, especially when she first arrives in New York, that allow you to emphasize with her immediately.  There's a fragility about her, but at the same time she exhibits a strength of character and sense of morality that is becoming; and being able to convey this level of complexity convincingly is a tribute to her ability as an actress.  John Goodman also does a good job as her father, a caring bear of a man who obviously has nothing but the best intentions for his daughter at heart.  His performance, and the way the situation of his having to let Violet go is handled makes it believable, and helps create an emotional bond between them and the audience.  It's something with which many will be able to identify, and it becomes one of the underlying strengths of the film. \tOne of the weaknesses of this project comes, not from the movie itself, but from the `promotion' of the movie; in this case the theatrical trailer, which is a gross misrepresentation of what `Coyote Ugly' really is.  Certainly the `coyotes' and the bar are a significant part of the film, and it's all exceptionally well and tastefully done, and is a fun part of the movie and definitely gives it some life; but I think the presentation in the trailer will do more to alienate a cross-section of audience that ultimately would appreciate this movie, but initially at least will not even see it, and only because of a misconception caused by the preview.  It must be noted that this is a PG-13; there is nary a profane word, and no sex or nudity in it.  It is an upbeat, entertaining film that should be readily embraced by a much wider audience than one would expect simply from seeing the trailer.  The excellent supporting cast includes Adam Garcia (Kevin), Izabella Miko (Cammie), Melanie Lynskey (Gloria), Bridget Moynahan (Rachel), Tyra Banks (Zoe) and LeAnn Rimes (In a cameo as herself).  Hopefully, if only by word-of-mouth, this movie will gain the audience it deserves.  Reminiscent of `Flashdance,' there is a universal theme here of having a dream and going for it.  In the final analysis, `Coyote Ugly' is a decent film that will appeal to anyone who's ever had or pursued a dream.

It was customary to leave certain things to the imagination of the viewer, but in this film we could clearly see ghouls devouring human limbs and innards. Even worse than the gore is the lack of hope that gradually overtakes the survivors of the zombie onslaught. They are weary, confused, and on edge. The bleakness is augmented by the black & white photography, which usually appeared grainy due to the fact that so many prints of NOTLD (which lapsed into the public domain at some point) were battered and worn.Stylistically and thematically, the movie owes a lot to two earlier films Carnival Of Souls to some extent, and The Last Man On Earth to an even greater extent. While The Last Man On Earth involved the audience after the great plague has already wiped out most of humanity, Romero's film signifies the beginning of society's collapse; his protagonists spend most of the film bickering and fighting amongst themselves, and are unable to pull together long enough to survive. It's a bleak vision, and one that seems particularly plausible, even if the scenario of flesh-eating ghouls is not.Beware any versions of the film that have been tampered with in any way, be it colorization or the god-awful 30th Anniversary Version that features inept newly added footage that detracts from the film in a every conceivable manner.

A semi all-star cast, with all of the actors clearly playing themselves.  A deadly boring story, little action, and it all goes on for far, far too long.I simply wasn't interested enough to put in the energy required to follow the plot, and so as the film progressed I knew less and less about what was happening.  Despite the realistic feel (which on deeper examination seems carefully contrived), I cared nothing for any of the characters (in fact, I found most of them quite irritating, especially the two detectives) and I kept waiting for something interesting to happen (eventually, almost praying for something interesting to happen).  Unfortunately, nothing did.  There are those who might enjoy this movie, I suppose, but I thought it was a complete dud, about as interesting to watch as plain, unsalted white rice is to eat.  5\/10.
