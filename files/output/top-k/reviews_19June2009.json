Now, obviously with a Scream 4 (is it a sequel? Is it a reboot? Only time will tell) on the horizon, the Scream trilogy has essentially come unraveled, but what Scream 3 attempts to do is close out the popular 90's defining horror series on a positive, somewhat epic note. Despite its many short-comings, it mostly accomplishes its goals.It's been a few years since tragedy struck a third time at Windsor College and Sidney (Neve Campbell) has forced herself into hiding. While Stab 3 rolls into production (what happened to Stab 2?), a killer strikes with a familiar M.O., slashing his way through the cast, leaving the odd couple of Dewey (David Arquette) and Gale (Courtney Cox) to try to solve the mystery before the killer fleshes out his own un-happy ending. For Sydney, this means digging up old ghosts and coming to terms with tragic truths.To be frank, there's a lot wrong with Scream 3, but then again, what third sequel in ANY franchise is ever perfect? The biggest shift from the previous flicks is in the toned down gore and uninventive death scenes. Despite the franchise's popularity, it's more than apparent this time around that the MPAA and the studio were growing impatient with on-screen splatter. Meanwhile, the script, drafted by Ehren Kruger (of no relation to Freddy Krueger) is overly jokey, and comes across as b-grade Kevin Williamson, which is pretty sad. A lot of the humor in the film revolves around lampooning Hollywood clichés, but unfortunately, unless you work in the business, these jokes are trite, boring and only serve to bog down the real story at hand.The film's strongest point is the who-dunnit theme, which feels bigger and more important than in the previous two films. There's an unsettling sense of mystery that carries the film and keeps it interesting when many of the other ideas presented are stale. Also, the chemistry between David Arquette and Courtney Cox helps make up for an overabundance of unlikeable characters in the film, portrayed by likable character-actors such as Parker Posey and Patrick Warburton. The ending and the final reveal of the killer &#x96; while slightly contrived &#x96; makes for a perfectly satisfying ending that wraps the trilogy up in a nice and neat little bow. Overall, an enjoyable conclusion that lags in pacing and indulges a bit too much in itself, but more than makes up for it in the end. As far as third entries in horror franchises go, Scream 3 could be a lot worse.Look out for a cameo from Jay & Silent Bob, as well as the always-great Lance Henrikson as a seedy B-movie mogul.

With nothing to define the decade but cheap sequels and even cheaper direct-to-video productions, the timing was just right for a film to come along that both defined its era and spun the genre on its head. In the 60's, it was Psycho. In the 70's, Halloween. The 80's were owned by Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street. Enter Scream, the one true stand-out genre flick of its time, a film that has incited as much praise as it has criticism from horror fan-boys, as well as inspiring and reviving a whole new breed of self-aware slasher films that were, sadly, not nearly as good as this big-boy.After losing control of the franchise he started with A Nightmare On Elm Street, director Wes Craven got his groove back with Scream, settling in as the director of its two sequels and earning himself back some of the credibility that the late 80's and early 90's stripped him of. With a clever script from newcomer Kevin Williamson, it was the first slasher film where its characters were aware of what was happening to them. Heck, they even invoke a set of rules to survive a horror film, while blatantly taking stabs at the well-worn classics of the horror genre. While this formula became rather redundant by the time Scream 2 rolled around (let alone, I Know What You Did Last Summer, Urban Legend and the like) it was rather inventive and fresh for its time, and taken in the correct context, makes for a brilliant and unique slasher film.You'll spend the bulk of the film trying to guess the identity of the killer, but thankfully the script is smart enough to lead you astray and only by blind luck would you be able to identify him\/her.

Ritchie's debut Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels was a refreshing, lean, original, and very funny British mixture of Action Comedies\/Gambling Dramas\/Crime Thrillers. Lock, Stock.. also introduced Jason Statham with whom Ritchie went on to making two more films and Vinnie Jones, a football player turned an actor. Ritchie's next movie, Snatch, was my introduction to his work. It is simply marvelous and my favorite. It uses the same broken narrative as Lock and Stock, intertwines numerous plot threads which intersect and play off each other, and follows the characters who are over-the-top deliciously evil, marvelously clueless and always funny. The plot revolves around a stolen diamond as huge as these historic celebrated stones you might have seen on display in the Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom in London Tower or Washington Museum of Natural History or in The State Diamond Fund of Moscow Kremlin. No wonder that every character in Snatch tries to get it. Among them, low-levels gangsters of all sorts of mafia, including Jewish, Russian, and London based. Add to the mix the Irish Gypsies who can't be trusted because whatever they say could not be understood even by the native English speakers. Don't forget a sadistic crime boss who keeps huge pet pigs with very specific diet. And then there is a dog that likes to snatch and swallow things. All sorts of things.I've seen Snatch many times. It is one of my favorite movies that I can watch from any scene and I would not switch the channel on it. I think it is the best Ritchie's film. A lot of his fans prefer Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels but my favorite is certainly Snatch. It is so perfect in its nastiness. It does not preach anything; it does not have deep message or any other purpose than to entertain and entertain it does. I've seen it so many times that I happily expect the familiar hilarious quotes or scenes or exchanges between the characters which are the best part of the movie. I pay attention to the soundtrack and to Ritchie's style that is known for frequent fast cuts and quick edits. Just want to mention that the same technique was also successfully used in his latest, Rocknrolla in one of the most hilarious sex scene I've ever seen. Ritchie likes to return to the same point in time several times to tell the story (or to show it) from the different points of view. The scenes of violence, sometimes grotesque, have been staged and choreographed so well that you can't help admiring them and smile while watching. I enjoy acting by everyone and I believe that the famous (and not so famous but very talented) actors had as much fun playing their outrageous characters as I did following them on the dark and gloomy streets of London underworld.Snatch is enormously enjoyable -on one condition though.

Ritchie likes to return to the same point in time several times to tell the story (or to show it) from the different points of view. The scenes of violence, sometimes grotesque, have been staged and choreographed so well that you can't help admiring them and smile while watching. I enjoy acting by everyone and I believe that the famous (and not so famous but very talented) actors had as much fun playing their outrageous characters as I did following them on the dark and gloomy streets of London underworld.Snatch is enormously enjoyable -on one condition though. You have to appreciate this kind of dark humor that goes together with strong violence. Otherwise, I have something to declare - stay away from it.

Rightfully so, Cruise was nominated for Best Actor by the Academy for this film, and flat out should have won!

The next day one of those young men (Derrick DeMarney) finds her body on the beach and is arrested for her murder. He eventually escapes and takes a young woman (Nova Pilbeam) with him so that they can try and prove his innocence. This film has a very similar story to that of THE 39 STEPS but that doesn't take away from any of the charm or drama here. The movie works very well as a thriller and as usual, Hitch manages to throw in some nice dark humor. The best case of this is early one when the man is trying to claim his innocence but Hitch shows the reaction of the crowd, none of whom believe him. The look on their faces is priceless and this dark scenes comes off very funny. Another good running gag is the girl's dog who keeps getting in the way or in some cases getting left behind to where the duo must stop what they're doing and wait on him. Some of the humor doesn't work and most of this deals with the cops being made to look like idiots and one scene where the cops have to ride with some pigs. The writing is quite good from start to finish and the master does a very good job making it into his own. There are countless good scenes including the wonderful ending. I didn't care for how the killer gave himself away but everything leading up to it was very well done. Pilbeam is terrific in her role as is DeMarney and both have wonderful chemistry.

It is in Ingmar Berman's 1973 picture, Cries and Whispers, in which he brings the human condition and emotion alive through the feeling in his viewers. It is the story of two sisters and their maid, who are trapped in a mansion, watching over their dying cancer ridden sister that sends a chilling message about life and love. Filled with many close-ups, stagnant in pose, focused to attention and lead the viewer into their own sense of agony, Igmar Bergman's film follows tragic emotion with such perfect skill.Agnes, dying of cancer, lays still in her bed while her two sisters, Karin and Maria, watch over her to be of aid until her final breath. While in the household, Agnes' faithful maid, Anna, provides the comfort and warmth needed as that of a mother, a fiend and even a sister. Bergman weaves together a film with little dialogue, and perfect visual imagery that is the true mover of such a film. Facial expressions can tell stories through many of Bergman's pictures. Like such is an example in the opening of the picture in which Bergman eyes his shot on Agnes' awakening in such a hideous pain and anguish. Her womb cancer has taken over her feelings to relish her sleep and now in her final numbered days, she lays torn in pain with a sweat that suffers and destroys her enjoyment of her final days. What Bergman and his award winning cinematographer Sven Nykvist have created through this scene is one of the most gut-wrenching depictions of physical distress in motion picture history. No viewer can sit through the entire opening five-minute sequence and not find themselves at paralysis with what is shown. Bergman focuses the entire film of silence and viewer-ship of his actresses and expresses much symbolism in a film that is soaking in it. Where some films fail to create a story while engaging the viewers in an overexposure of metaphorical language, Cries and Whispers wins in multi-dimensions. Thought to be a heavy drama, cries and whispers could stand the test of being categorized in horror. Although not your typical horror of blood and demons, this film resonates like the interior of the soul as something with heart-break, Closter phobia, fear, silence, longing, sexual-disgust, self-mutilation and deception. All in all, it's silence that plays the key role in such a picture. Silence is deadly and it explains how horrible these women have come to be, women of repressed voices, and the message conveyed is that death is the only release from the pain of life.

Now that I've seen it while actually paying attention, I must say it's pretty disappointing. I can't even really remember one laugh, which is kind of a problem in a comedy. It's a weird thing though, I know it's actually pretty well-written. It's clever how all these plot lines intertwine, it's creative how everyone is held back from their goals by some unfortunate misunderstandings and whatnot. And I know those cow scenes are funny, but I just can't bring myself to be amused. The actors are also pretty annoying in this one, especially Rowan Atkinson, who plays some kind of Italian Mr.Bean rip-off. All his screen time in this movie is devoted to making some really creepy funny faces. Then again, the same can be said about Mr.Bean's Holiday. Even Whoopi Goldberg bothers me, I thought I'd never see the day. This thing isn't all bad though, the pacing is still pretty nice, there's hardly a boring moment. This wasn't really a chore to sit through, I actually wanted to know who would win the money. The outcome is really lame though. I'm not going to give it away, but just think of the absolute lamest possible outcome to this plot. The best I can say about this movie is that it's watchable.

No intricate symbolism to analyze, no hidden meanings to extrapolate, no big ideas to grapple with. Some movies (well all movies, but some more clear than others) simply take you by the shoulder and tell you let me tell you how life is. Good old-fashioned storytelling that in all the sound and fury and clamor of the quirky, self-referential, overplotted cinema of our days seems to have fallen by the wayside. TENDER MERCIES is this kind of movie, a low-key character study that has no easy answers to give, no big twists, no disparate plot strands to tie neatly in the end. It is left as open-ended as it began. A washed up country singer wakes up in the room of a cheap motel, the floor strewn with empty whiskey bottles, with nowhere to go and not even a coin in his pocket to make a phone call.When Horton Foote writes, all aspiring screenwriters should sit down and take notice. Not because he was a twice Oscar-decorated veteran (for this and TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD), but because he exemplifies great writing in the most simple, clear fashion possible - writing from the inside out. And whereas TOMORROW, his previous collaboration with Robert Duvall (playing a poor, illiterate farmer in a Faulkner adaptation), a stark, slowburn but ultimately dour southern Gothic story that lacked the affinity for the Gothic to make it work, was not a total success, Tender Mercies is. And it's great because it is clear, honest and immediate in its all-encompassing totality.An emotional clarity in the story reflected in Bruce Beresford's direction reflected back into the story. Everyone seems to be on the exact same page on the movie they're trying to make. Beresford doesn't intrude; he doesn't keep a minimalist distance either. He leaves enough room to the worldweary characters and rural scenery to speak for themselves but he's always there to add his subtle touches.Take for example the scene when Robert Duvall returns home late at night after he stormed out furious a few hours earlier. A subtle dark layer has been woven into his character in a previous scene when he was described as a mean drunk and we saw him getting out of a liquor store with a bottle in a paper bag. Back home his wife lies in bed anxious for his return. She hears someone bumble at the door, grappling with door and keys, staggering in the dark as he gets in. She throws the lights on and we see Duvall, not looking good. But he tells her he's not drunk, that he bought booze and poured it down the street. As the wife gets up from bed to make him something to eat, foreshadowed menace and domestic violence have suddenly turned into reconciliation with his old life and faith in his new one. The movie is filled with these small, seemingly casual but masterfully orchestrated, beats of action and dialogue, beat by beat creating a poignant whole.In the end we don't get the big catharsis. The heartstrings are barely tugged at all. But the combination of Duvall's realization (I don't trust in happiness, never have, never will) and the scene where he and a small boy throw a ball in an empty field, says all there is to be said. About Duvall's character and life as seen through the writer's eyes. Honest in its intentions, pure in its emotional power and empathy, this is the kind of movie to be cherished by a small audience and ignored by the rest.

What works extremely well is the humor that is spread throughout with the best example coming from the fight sequence in the baggage cart. The way the fight is handled was masterfully done and Redgrave's comic timing is wonderful. Redgrave, to me anyways, steals the film with his charm and laid back comic approach.

There have been many cases where I was immediately fooled by a sequel that had more packed in it (longer, bigger, more characters, more effects, more action, etc.) thinking with something other than my common sense! When I first saw DIE HARD 2 back in 1990 (the year it came out), I thoughtOh, it's not confined to that building and is instead in a big airport (Dulles), so it's got to be better! McClane gets to move around more, doesn't have to walk around barefoot, gets to interact with a lot of people, so it will be less uncomfortable.The action can be more spread out and is not restrictive. So it's got to be better.Wrong, wrong, and wrong!Again, with hindsight and repeated viewing, DIE HARD 2 continually gets downgraded by me as what is wrong with most Hollywood action movies, especially nowadays.What I realize is that part of the brilliance of the original DIE HARD was it's claustrophobic nature and that by limiting the action to that one skyscraper, it allows everything to be more personal, centrally located, and focused. You had to have everything happen in that one building, so you couldn't cheat or fool the audience. By design, the filmmakers had to come up with original ideas. In a situation like DIE HARD 2, there is action HERE, THERE, and EVERYWHERE to the point of just a bunch of the same action scenes, each with non-quotable, stupid dialogue and one-liners. The action in DIE HARD 2 is not unique, nor are any of the situations scary or tense, as they were in DIE HARD.Our hero is once again John McClane (played by the reliable action hero Bruce Willis, but this time in a thankless situation) and as previously stated, he is at Dulles Airport in D.C. waiting his wife Holly's (Bonnie Bedelia again) arriving plane so they can meet her parents for Christmas. A bad snowstorm has caused so that even planes at nearby airports must re-route to Dulles. This time, as opposed to in the original DIE HARD, these terrorists are actual terrorists, a group of U.S. military expatriates who plan to seize control of Dulles and force them to have the plane of a political prisoner routed to a special runway. This group is led by Col. Stuart (played by William Sadler). This is another huge problem with DIE HARD 2. The main villain is not effective. While in DIE HARD, Hans Gruber was truly diabolical, smart, charming, and relentless, Stuart in DIE HARD 2 is pretty much just a stock villain who has an eternal scowl on his face with no distinguishing characteristics. Very monotone character. Also, Stuart strangely doesn't seem to be fazed or surprised about McClane's involvement in trying to stop him, which I find unrealistic.Another problem is that whereas DIE HARD had a core of memorable supporting characters (Holly, Hans, Karl, Powell, Robinson, Thornburg, etc.) each with some character believability and depth, DIE HARD 2 is populated with virtually all annoying characters (the airport personnel led by Fred Dalton Thompson and Dennis Franz are spectacularly idiotic; at least in DIE HARD, even though Robinson wasn't too bright, he had legitimate reason to believe that McClane might not be on the up and up; these airport guys had no excuse, so why waste the whole 2 hours arguing with him!). Also, I found most of the more minor characters like the flight attendants on Holly's plane, the female news reporter following McClane around like his pet, that creepy drunk guy working in the underground part of the airport, etc. all annoying.Then you have John Amos (playing an Army major and a former colleague of Col. Stuart's) and his military squad pop in to save the day at the last minute, but again, it is not exciting or tense at all. In fact, with all the action in DIE HARD 2, none of it is thrilling, just by-the-numbers fare fake-looking fights and machine guns going off all over the place, but without the style, flair, and, dare I say, realism of DIE HARD. The action situations in the original were more sparse, believable, and well-staged.But the biggest offense of DIE HARD 2 is the cringe-inducing dialogue. It is really bad. One of the reasons many of the characters come off so bland, monotone, and annoying. I mean, it is unintentionally laughable. ALL characters are a victim to it.

The action situations in the original were more sparse, believable, and well-staged.But the biggest offense of DIE HARD 2 is the cringe-inducing dialogue. It is really bad. One of the reasons many of the characters come off so bland, monotone, and annoying. I mean, it is unintentionally laughable. ALL characters are a victim to it. And finally, amazingly, although it came out only 2 years later, this sequel seems way more dated than the original. In fact, the original doesn't seem dated at all to me. DIE HARD 2 is just a mindless action flick.

Along the way Donat pretty much kidnaps a woman (Madeleine Carroll) and the two try to prove that a group of spies are behind the murder and perhaps much more. This type of story is one that Hitchcock would revisit throughout his career with NORTH BY NORTHWEST being the most popular example. This film really gives the director his first extremely good film even though there are a few flaws here including how easy it is for our hero to constantly escape. He's got spies and cops after him yet he seems to escape with way too much ease. That's a minor nitpick but the rest of the movie is incredibly fun and manages to be entertaining from start to finish. What really carries the film is the IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT-type of romance and road trip that goes on between Donat and Carroll. With lesser actors this romantic side plot would have killed the film as well as the drama but the two actors are so great together that you can't help but want to see them go through all the flirtatious stuff. Donat really steals the film with his laid back style of acting, which manages to make his quite calm and collective even during the more suspenseful scenes. Carroll is quite cute and makes you enjoy her character even though she turns out hero in early in the film. The film has a very fast pace to it and you can see countless great touches from the master including a great scene early on in the train involving looking over a newspaper.

He's made an eclectic group of films (TOP GUN, RAIN MAN, COLOR OF MONEY, BORN ON 4TH OF JULY, A FEW GOOD MEN, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE, JERRY MAGUIRE, MAGNOLIA, MINORITY REPORT, COLLATERAL) and has ranged in these films for my money from very good to great, mostly great. In every one of these films, Cruise exudes confidence and a persona that etches itself into the film and onto the viewer as we watch him. Ironically, Cruise the man tends to get confused with the actor and there is a core group on ongoing fanatics in Hollywood who simply refuse to accept his brilliance and contribution to American film. The gentlemen can simply ACT. And this film I'm about to review is the genesis of this great actor.In retrospect, I had a difficult time thinking about what were truly the best films of the 1980s. The 80s decade is widely seen as a pop culture decade with a LOT of entertaining movies, but very few truly great films. Fortunately, RISKY BUSINESS (premiering in 1983) manages to overcome this, and for me, is easily a top 10 film of the decade, maybe top 5! Why? It is really ahead of its time. A film starring mostly teenagers (or actors playing teens), it is not the standard teen fare that the 80s threw at us. In fact, it is very adult in its mood, tone, and atmosphere. It is one of the atmospheric films I've ever seen, almost film noir-ish in nature. Most of the scenes are set at night and it has a sexy, cool mood that permeates throughout.As I've mentioned, RISKY BUSINESS stars the great Tom Cruise in his starmaking performance as Joel Goodsen. Cruise was about 21 when he played 17-year old high-school senior Joel. Joel is a rather shy, wimpy, underconfident son of upper class parents who live in a Chicago suburb. The start of the film has Joel and his friends (including Barry and Miles, played wonderfully by Bronson Pinchot and Curtis Armstrong) pondering their futures and places in the world. Joel is a member of the Future Entrepreneurs at his school and they must essay a project where they explain how they made money.Joel's parents go on vacation and he has the house to himself. Joel has a little fun while they're away, including that iconic scene where Cruise, sans pants, dances in his folks' living room to Old Time Rock n' Roll. Also, Joel gets the number of a call girl service and gets Lana! Ah, Lana! The object of many a teenage boys fantasies. Rebecca DeMornay plays Lana and this has got to be one of the sexiest, surest performances by an actress ever in such a role! I've seen a lot of hooker roles, but many of them seem either dull or fake. DeMornay plays it very sensually, yet still exudes believability. After their encounter, Lana steals an expensive object from Joel's home and he goes after her to recover it. As it turns out, Lana is in trouble because she owes money to her pimp Guido (Joe Pantoliano in a memorably sleazy performance).Needing each other (Lana needs a place to stay and Joel needs confidence!), Joel and Lana form an initially uneasy alliance, then form the plan to turn Joel's home into a brothel. Joel enlists his friends as Johns and Lana calls up her girls to provide, the, errr, service. Along the way, Joel gets into various scrapes and trouble, but in the end learns a valuable lesson about life and how people think and operate. In the end, I'm sure he's the better for having survived it! RISKY BUSINESS is a gem of a film that in hindsight should have been an even bigger hit than it was when it came out. The performances are uniformly excellent, the dialogue is top-notch, and the mood of the film is so self-assured and focused that you know an expert filmmaker must have been behind it.

Re-uniting Craven and screenwriter Kevin Williamson, the film also saw the return of its surviving stars as well as the now-iconic Ghostface killer, who, for obvious reasons, carries an alternate identity than that of the killer(s) in the first film. Stalking Sidney and her friends at college, the film centers around the damaged character and the paranoia that continues to cripple her life. As Deputy Dewey puts it You probably already know him...or her...or them. They're probably already in your life. They get off on that.The film can't help but feel redundant when compared to its predecessor, especially when it comes to its surprise finish. That's not to say the film is a complete re-hash though. Thankfully, it still puts your expectations through the loops and keeps you on the edge of your seat with some nail-biting suspense and gruesome blood-shed. In fact, when you compare it to other like-minded films of the time (see Scream rip-offs), it's downright nasty and fun at the same time! The college campus setting also helps change things up a bit, and with so many horror sequels ripe for the picking, Scream 2 is to horror sequels what Scream was to horror movies in general. It ups the ante, raises your expectations and (for the most part) meets them.The direction by Craven seems a little more confident this go-round, which is unfortunate since Williamson's script gives its characters clunky and awkward dialogue to spit, which severely drags down the film. The first one was whip-smart, but this one's a little milder. The tone of the flick and the overall plot is just-right; it's in the little things that bog the flick down. Even still, its flaws are minor, and it's got another great, talented cast, some of whom meet unfortunate and grisly demises. Keep an eye out for wacky Aunt Jackie from Roseanne herself, Laurie Metcalf, in a seemingly minor but memorable role.

Stalking Sidney and her friends at college, the film centers around the damaged character and the paranoia that continues to cripple her life. As Deputy Dewey puts it You probably already know him...or her...or them. They're probably already in your life. They get off on that.The film can't help but feel redundant when compared to its predecessor, especially when it comes to its surprise finish. That's not to say the film is a complete re-hash though. Thankfully, it still puts your expectations through the loops and keeps you on the edge of your seat with some nail-biting suspense and gruesome blood-shed. In fact, when you compare it to other like-minded films of the time (see Scream rip-offs), it's downright nasty and fun at the same time! The college campus setting also helps change things up a bit, and with so many horror sequels ripe for the picking, Scream 2 is to horror sequels what Scream was to horror movies in general. It ups the ante, raises your expectations and (for the most part) meets them.The direction by Craven seems a little more confident this go-round, which is unfortunate since Williamson's script gives its characters clunky and awkward dialogue to spit, which severely drags down the film. The first one was whip-smart, but this one's a little milder. The tone of the flick and the overall plot is just-right; it's in the little things that bog the flick down. Even still, its flaws are minor, and it's got another great, talented cast, some of whom meet unfortunate and grisly demises. Keep an eye out for wacky Aunt Jackie from Roseanne herself, Laurie Metcalf, in a seemingly minor but memorable role.
