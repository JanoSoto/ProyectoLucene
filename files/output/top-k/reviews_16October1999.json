In the year where the 100th anniversary of Alfred Hitchcock's birth is being celebrated, here is the germ of an idea on which he would have put his indelible stamp of creativity. The film as publicized in trailers and TV teasers persuaded many moviegoers to want to see it. However, the advertising has given away 90% of the plot. What's left is a flatly photographed and flaccidly directed yarn with so many holes in it that the audience was audibly making comments as the heroine, Libby, gamely portrayed by Ashley Judd, begins her journey of frustration, determination, and revenge.  One of Hitchcock's ongoing themes is the wrong person caught up in events beyond his\/her control (North by Northwest, The Wrong Man). Here Judd's character is wrongly accused and framed for the murder of her husband (Bruce Greenwood). Once she has an idea that he is not dead at all, why didn't she just call her lawyer? This is just one of the ridiculous holes in this Swiss cheese of a plot.  When one of her prison mates, the wonderful Roma Maffia, explains that she cannot be tried again for the murder of her husband (the double jeopardy of the title), Libby patiently builds herself up physically to exact revenge on him. Tommy Lee Jones is her parole officer who doggedly pursues her, first to recapture her, and later to help vindicate her. There is lots of action, pursuit and some suspense. Jones can play this role in his sleep. He is almost the same character he ably portrayed in `The Fugitive' and `U.S. Marshals'. The pity is in what could have been. Director, Bruce Beresford (Driving Miss Daisy) has definitely seen better days.
