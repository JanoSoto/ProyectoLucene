Wilcox, Forbidden Planet opens in the 23rd century, with Commander John Adams (Leslie Nielsen) of the starship C-57D landing on the planet Altair IV. Adams attempts to make contact with a human colony that was established on the planet several decades earlier. To Adams' surprise, this colony has perished. Only Dr. Edward Morbius (Walter Pidgeon) and his daughter Altaira (Anne Francis) seem to have survived.Late in Forbidden Planet, it is revealed that Altair IV was once inhabited by a race of aliens known as the Krell. Though the Krell are now extinct, Altair IV still possesses vast, subterranean caverns packed with working Krell technology. Doctor Morbius becomes obsessed with this technology, determined to learn its secrets. Morbius rationalises these obsessions &#x96; the alien machines may one day benefit humanity, he insists &#x96; but Capain Adams begins to suspect that something more sinister is afoot.Forbidden Planet's final act contains a shocking revelation. Aided by a machine capable of materialising conscious and unconscious desires, the Krell wiped themselves out. Using this same technology, Morbius destroyed all human colonists on Altair IV. He did this to preserve his monopoly on both Krell technology and his own daughter, a young woman who is adored by colonists, Adams' crew and whom Morbius himself has psycho-sexual longings for.Interestingly, Morbius is unaware that he has been slaughtering people. So blind is Morbius, that Adams must spell things out for him The machine instantaneously projects solid matter to any point on the planet, for any purpose! Adams explains. But like you, the Krell forgot one deadly danger &#x96; their own subconscious lust for hate and destruction! And so those mindless beasts of their subconscious had access to a machine that could never be shut down! The secret devil of every soul on the planet all set free at once to loot and maim! And take revenge, Morbius, and kill! Morbius, a man of science, has thus become warped by his own ego, his own unconscious, his own desire to play God. This kind of science bashing was typical of 1950s science fiction films, which tended to associate war and murder with technological advancements, scientists and an insurmountable human nature, rather than politics, class and economics. Where Forbidden differs from these films is its thick Freudian subtext (The ego is not the master of its own house, Freud once wrote, and the mind is like an iceberg, with only one seventh of its bulk visible!). In Wilcox's hands, man dare not risk exploring outer space unless he first confront the forbidden planets lurking between the ears.Along with The Thing, The Day the Earth Stood Still and Invaders From Mars, Forbidden Planet remains one of the best science fiction films of the 1950s. Produced by MGM studios, it was also one of the first attempts at a big-budget, serious science fiction film, utilising glossy Deluxe Color, expansive CinemaScope and a script (loosely based on Shakespeare's The Tempest) with high-brow pretensions. In keeping with producer Nicholas Nayfack's desire for cutting-edge spectacle, the film also utilised meticulous rotor-scoping by Walt Disney animators, and an innovative, entirely electronic film score. The first of its kind, Forbidden Planet's score predated the invention of music synthesisers by about eight years.Modern audiences will no doubt scoff at Forbidden Planet. But to those interested in early 20th century science fiction, the film offers many pleasures. Today it resembles a kind of meticulously constructed, retro artifact, filled with charming gadgets, robots, lasers, eye-popping colours, giant matte paintings and sets zanier than Frank Sinatra's living room. Sculpted by the finest craftsmen of its era, the film seems simultaneously modernist and unaware of its impending obsolescence; the world of tomorrow according to the world of yesterday.Despite its age, Forbidden Planet still boasts a palpable sense of menace. The film contains one famous sequence in which a Monsters of the Id attacks our heroes, a sequence which scared the hell out of 1950s audiences, and which would influenced a number of subsequent film directors. This monster is handled cleverly throughout the picture, Wilcox hinting at its presence with foot prints, casts of its claws and the ripples of energy which momentarily illuminate its invisible body. Elsewhere the film contains cinema's best aliens outside 2001 A Space Odyssey and Solaris, which Wilcox never shows, but hints at, alludes to and keeps resolutely alien.In a 1970s interview, Gene Roddenberry would claim that Forbidden Planet didn't influence his Star Trek franchise. Most film historians, however, cite Forbidden Planet (along with the 1950 novel, The Voyage of the Space Beagle) as a large influence on Star Trek. Within Wilcox's films we thus find precursors to Star Trek's transporter devices, along with Roddenberry's fondness for abandoned outposts, mad scientists, saucer-shaped spaceships, crews modelled on the US navy, and lots of chauvinists, gratuitous flirting, short skirts and bosomy young women.

Repo Man is all those things, it dares to be bold and challenging, its satirical edges slicing away at film genres and American societies. Director Alex Cox (how wonderful that such an American film is directed by a British guy) fills out this scuzzy part of L.A. with hippies, freaks, punks, aliens, scientist nutters, UFO nutters, effeminate coppers and the repo men themselves, a bunch of grizzled souls hardened by life's travails, but always with a quip, a smile and a gunshot at the ready.The dialogue fizzes with cheeky derring-do, some lines even today still quotable and used in pubs and clubs across the continents.

Performances are bang on the dollar, Stanton the class act, Estevez superb, Tracey Walter proving what his fans already knew, that he's a legendary character actor.From an opening involving a pair of smoking boots, to the glowing sci-fi nirvana finale, Repo Man kicks ass.

I know I am just adding to this long list of positive reviews, but I feel this film deserves to be my first review on this website. While this film may not be my favourite film, it is most definitely a film I respect. When I was young and watching 'The Goonies' and 'Back to the Future' I thought films were only made to entertain and were not made to convey a clear message about humanity. This film was the first film I watched that made me understand that the film medium could provide the world with such philosophical messages and could teach young people, like me, that life must be valued. Pretty deep right? Well this is the message that the film carries. Red values Andy's friendship and life. He does not want him to die and wants him to survive and when I was watching this film I thought... wow! Two prisoners, one who definitely killed another person, can be so rational and kind. I learnt from this film that the world is a horrible place and emotions can get the better of people; but through it all, it is about moving on and making sure that one is not affected by the emotional trauma that has arrived at their front door and instead take that trauma and improve themselves and other people like Andy did throughout the film. By the end, when Red and Andy are embracing on the beach, free, I see two men who have been through years of pain and self-pity clear of all negative thoughts; I see two friends that through all the emotional trauma that we see them going through are still strong.Now I can talk about themes and the impact that this film had on me all day long, but I have to praise everyone involved in this film. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman embody their characters perfectly and when I watch it now as a 17 year old who has seen his fair share of great performances these stick out as real people and not simply a performance. Frank Darababont, who not only directed the film but also wrote it, crafts a film that is very entertaining to watch but that also conveys these themes effortlessly and writes some very memorable lines that really affect one's perspective on human nature. The scene with Brooks is a scene that had me close to tears and that showed me the impact of being 'institutionalized'.Anyway, I have said enough about this film. It is very good and really pushed me into seeing films in a different light. If you want to read any more reviews or my list on my favourite films of all time please check me out.

It's a movie that was criminally overlooked upon its initial release, overshadowed by other movies that year like FORREST GUMP and PULP FICTION. The performances of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are the stuff of Hollywood legend, and the movie put Frank Darabont on the map.All of that being said, however, the movie is missing one thing that would have instantly propelled it into the stratos of fame when it was first released Jeff Goldblum. Imagine, if you will, the character of Andy Dufresne as portrayed by one of Hollywood's most charismatic and adorably dorky leading men. Goldblum would have certainly brought something special to the table, something that the public clearly noticed was missing, hence why it took so long for the film to be recognised as a masterpiece. Also of note is that the character 'Red', portrayed originally by Morgan Freeman, could also have been instead played by Jeff Goldblum. His trademark stutter, the sign of a man whose brain perhaps moves more quickly than his mouth can keep up with (though he is certainly a fast- talker!) would have lent a subtle humor to such classic moments as the narration describing Dufresne's escape. Alas, that isn't something we're ever likely to see, and will be forever left wondering What if?Finally, although there is little evidence to support this claim, I feel as if the movie would have greatly benefited from Jeff Goldblum's direction. He so clearly knows what to do in front of the camera that one can only assume he has quite a bit of knowhow behind it as well. In my semi-professional opinion, and with no disrespect meant to Frank Darabont (whose adaptation of THE MIST is, despite its lack of Jeff Goldblum, an amazing horror film), this movie is absolute garbage compared to what it could have been were it directed by Jeff Goldblum.My vote 4 stars out of 10, at least until a Director's Cut is released with all actors and credits replaced with Jeff Goldblum.

Although he is divorced from his ex-wife, Jackie(Susan Sarandon), she still has legal rights to visit her kids, the rebellious Anna (Jena Malone) and the bratty younger son Ben (Liam Aiken). At first glance, we take our sympathies towards Isabel who's trying so hard to win the approval with the rather difficult and exasperating kids and that Jackie seems quite judgemental over Luke's choice of a new fiancé because she's not from the same class system as her. But as the film progresses, we find ourselves taking pity over Jackie who in spite of her obnoxious character and her overbearing poisonous tongue, we discover that she has terminal cancer. Meanwhile the kids seem to adapt to similar behaviour patterns, and Luke just goes on what needs to be done without saying very much. In spite of the ensemble of talented performers, Stepmom was cursed by a mundane script and forceful attempt to get the entire audience in tears. The box office success was quite mediocre at best as Susan Sarandon was nominated for a Golden Globe for her performance. I was quite surprised that the Academy Awards neglected this film, since their mindsets are based on films that provide emotional backdrops from the characters. To me in my estimation the demographics of people who'll look up to this movie are likely upper middle-class women in the 30-40 year old age group. Perhaps the Anna Harrison character might attract the adolescent girl demographics especially those who have a divorced or deceased parent and are struggling with adapting to their new parent. The middle-aged parents who are sadly diagnosed with a terminal illness might also find the story intriguing and might have a better understanding of the physical and emotional stages they're going through let alone the hardships of those surrounding them. I might sound like an insensitive jerk, but I really did not feel at ease watching this movie. The acting and the cinematography were the best things going for this movie,but there was a lump in my throat after the final credits rolled. I really thought director Chris Columbus did too much manipulative tactics to force us into one tear-fest after another. The representing of the tear-factor shed very little impact plus there were many scenes that made me feel very uncomfortable. If you thought Stepmom was a feel-good movie, what were you thinking? When Isabel learns that Anna's had a nasty break-up with her discourteous boyfriend Brad Kovitsky (Jason Maves), she encourages Anna to inflict verbal abuse towards him by calling him names like limp-dick, while Ben is can be seen giggling at every word that's said. Gee, I thought adults discouraged kids to call others names, not encourage them. Sure Brad may have deserved that, but adults should know better that it's not appropriate behaviour. I was also taken aback by the rich, posh multi-million dollar estate that Jackie was residing in and clichéd of course was the fact that it came with a horse and a horse trail.It made me ponder at just how did a nice charming New York City fashion photographer like Isabel Kelly would ever get romantically involved with a much older, mundane guy like Luke and having to put up with two quite incorrigible children who clearly hate her for the sake of her existence. I also couldn't believe my eyes during the scenes at the school play where all the kids were dressed in perfect Hollywood style costumes and each and every one of their voices sound purely angelic. Didn't they have at least one kid who felt awkward or uncomfortable? That would have been believable. What's also strange was that Anna was six years older than Ben. How the hell are they in the same play? Shouldn't they be in different schools? Okay so maybe the scriptwriter may know the classic song of Ain't No Mountain High Enough by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell, but it makes me wonder how did Anna and Ben seem to know this song quite flawlessly? They were born in 1986 and 1991 respectively several years before this song was ever released. The other thing that bugs me was that the connection they had with this song serves as the unity between them. It also sickens me that they play this song on three occasions. Gaye and Terrell had other songs that weren't about going through get lengths to unite with one another.One a plus note I'm really impressed with the resiliency towards Isabel. I mean surviving through all the ordeals between this very hateful family, deserves a standing ovation. She standing up to the materialistic Jackie and her obnoxious step-daughter without the desires to strangle either one deserves my praises.Overall this is not a horrible film, though I can't really recommend it due to the hateful characters, the uncomfortable atmosphere and the details that make me cringe. We should feel sorry about someone dying, but we can't embody pity because of the venom that comes out of the victim's mouth. I would steer clear from this one.

Cathy Bates may have stolen the show, but playing against James Caan's low-key style made her performance even more arresting. After an accident in a remote location, famed novelist, Paul Sheldon (James Caan), is kept prisoner by his most ardent fan, a nurse named Annie Wilkes (Cathy Bates). There are many twists to the story, but shockingly, she stops him from escaping by breaking his ankles (in Stephen King's novel she cuts off one of his feet). Although the story is unusual, it reminded me of a few I had come across before. John Fowles The Collector is an obvious one, and even gets a mention in the novel Misery, but others are also interesting. Years ago, I used to love those collections of horror stories from Alfred Hitchcock and Pan Books etc. One was Marmalade Wine by Joan Aiken, which I read in the First Fontana Book Of Horror Stories in 1966. It was about a guy called Roger Hacker who goes for a walk through the woods and meets a once a famous surgeon who lives there as a recluse. Hacker unwisely boasts that he can predict the future, and the doctor invites him to sample his homemade wine. When Hacker awakens from a drug-induced slumber, he realizes he won't be walking home any time soon &#x96; the doctor has amputated his feet. It was actually made into an episode of Rod Serling's Night Gallery around 1970. Another along the same theme is The Man who liked Dickens by Evelyn Waugh, which I first encountered in The Ninth Fontana Book Of Horror Stories although it was actually written in 1933. It became a sequence in the novel, and then the film, A Handful of Dust.In that one, Tony Last, while on an expedition in Brazil, ends up alone and fever-ridden in the jungle.

When he recovers from his illness, he is happy to comply with the illiterate Mr. Todd's request to read aloud to him for a couple of hours each day.

He may have some other purpose in the building other than odd jobs.At its best, this completely off the wall and extremely stylized French take on post-nuke and cannibal cinema is one of the most original films of its kind. The co-directors, Marc Caro and Jean-Pierre Jeunet, give Delicatessen a striking visual design, largely avoiding cool colours like blue (although there are occasional flashes of green); the colour palette consists of a lot of yellows, oranges, reds, and browns. It's a clever hook, but also making this a worthy entertainment are the incredible energy and the consistent tone of dark, and farcical, humour. There's nothing else this viewer has seen that is quite like Delicatessen, and that can only be a good thing.The performances themselves are very stylized, with the well chosen actors going for broke a lot of the time. Pinon and Dougnac are appealing in the leading roles. Also leaving a big impression are Dreyfus, Karin Viard, Ticky Holgado, Anne-Marie Pisani, Howard Vernon, and especially Silvie Laguna as the troubled Aurore, driven to stage very elaborate suicide attempts by voices.

Characters This movie has such depth to each character and makes you feel for everyone. Everyone gas such a unique personality and it makes the movie greater than it already is. Setting The setting has a very dark atmosphere because of all the bad this that happen there but when Red and Andy have their talks between each other, you forget about all that and it seems nice.Story The story BY FAR is one of the best I've ever seen. The story is so amazing it has so much descriptive detail and includes all the characters in the story.Verdict This movie is the best one I have ever seen. It is my favourite Movie ever HANDS DOWN. I highly recommended this movie to anyone. 10\/10 for me ","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"19 April 2015","score":"","review":" Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) is a social worker who has chosen to pursue a unique method of therapy in which she is psychically transported into the mind of a patient while they are dreaming.

The overall plot was interesting and the special effects were quite good.

Some people are complaining about plot holes, just ignore that, there may be some minor plot holes but they didn't take away from the fun of this move.It's not really a horror movie at all, kind of a ghost movie, and there are some jump-scares. Those were fun too.I was skeptical that Keanu Reeves could pull off the part of a nasty wife-beating hillbilly, but he really did a good job! You could hardly recognize him. Maybe he's a good actor after all. The only place he started looking like the normal Keanu Reeves was in the court scenes, I guess without all the hillbilly clothes it's harder to project that image.Some people said they guessed the murderer, I had suspicions but I was never really sure. In fact I settled on the wrong person. They put a few false clues out there to throw you off the track.The part of the mentally disturbed Buddy Cole is played beautifully by Giovanni Ribisi. Wait until you find out what the blue diamond is all about...! Overall the acting was great, it really got me into the movie, into the feel of living in that little town.A lot of horrifying, disturbing parts, not for the kids! I gave it 8 out of 10. If I felt like I hadn't wasted my time, it gets at least a 6. This one I even watched a second time with my wife. Normally a multiple-watch movie would get a 9 or 10 from me, but it didn't quite make it, close though...

The violence, that's overwhelming in every single second, at the horror, that makes this movie breathtaking. But the best part, and I think not a single person would disagree with me, is the ending. The movie takes a great twist, that makes it one of the most surprising and brilliant movies, I've ever seen. Because it suddenly becomes clear to all, that this movie is not just about violence, but about a lost human being, that ends over the edge trying to feel, trying to make a difference in the predictable, boring nightmare he lives in. After reading some of the user reviews on this page, its clear that a lot of people don't get the movies message, and actually accuses it for promoting violence and terror actions. While watching the horrifying level of violence, just keep rising through the movie, I'm pretty sure to say, that the directors of this movie thinks violence is a bad idea. Especially, when an innocent man, who you have gone to love and sympathies throughout the movie, dies. I love the way Tyler Durden reacts to the society, by keeping questioning the things we along the way have taken for given. I, for one, highly promotes these kind of thoughts, and i think everybody should watch this movie, and then go out question the world we live in. That's how we grow as a society. So, point of this hole thing is, that if you think this movie is all about half-naked men fighting each other, you're terrible wrong. And just by the record, I'm a thirteen year old girl, so the thing about this being only a movie for men has kind of fallen to the ground. I would proudly recommend this movie to any person I know, because its quite incredible.
