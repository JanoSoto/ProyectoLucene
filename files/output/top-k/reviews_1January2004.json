I don't think I've seen one better. If there is one better, I don't think I could manage to sit through it, anyway. Though it is intense, violent, and bloody, it is also entertainment, albeit of the profoundest kind. Even those viewers who normally pass up opportunities to be shocked and appalled by on-screen violence should not deny themselves the chance of seeing this great film at least once.People discussing this picture tend to agree on one thing The Omaha Beach sequence that starts the story proper is the high point of the picture. I concur. It throws some awful imagery at the viewer, making you feel like you are a part of the landing. As bullets rip into the innards of men around you, you almost feel like you are in mortal danger. But the sequence works not because of the bloodiness, but because of the pacing. Despite the objections of some, director Stephen Spielberg doesn't push your face in gore unrelievedly, but creates a story in this sequence that has a clear beginning, middle, and end. Spielberg makes you feel the human cost of the battle in some small way (he never pretends to be capturing all of it) but keeps the camera focused on characters like Tom Hanks's Cpt. Miller and Tom Sizemore's Sgt. Horvath who you feel are going to make it through at least this fight. Much of the carnage is shown in small flashes, or in the corners of the frame. At the risk of trivializing the actual conflict, the result is like a rollercoaster ride, a mighty daunting one that you feel some measure of achievement after you sit through it once, and actually grows more powerful with repeat viewings, which is not as horrible once you have seen it once and gotten a good idea who lives and dies.The rest of the film can only pale in comparison, and is often unfairly dismissed for losing some of the momentum of Omaha. But how could any director, however great, sustain such momentum? And who would want to?Instead, the film goes into a section that I think is even more affecting, when we see the typing pool where female clerks rattle out pro forma letters from Joes who speak in male voices about how each casualty was the finest and best soldier they ever had the privilege of serving with. Then one woman notices her letter is addressed to the same mother as another she just finished typing, and the central plot is set in motion. Three brothers have been killed in action, it turns out, and a fourth is missing in action and must be found. Harve Presnell as George C. Marshall, U.S. Army Chief of Staff, recites from memory a letter sent by Abraham Lincoln nearly a century ago, in the process giving one of the most powerful performances in a movie full of them, and then we get a sequence that visually quotes Norman Rockwell as Mrs. Ryan wordlessly gets word of `the sacrifice she has laid on the altar of freedom.' Watching her collapse on her porch as the priest emerges from the black sedan is not easily done with dry eyes, because we understand by then how commonplace this sort of thing was.There are moments of humor in Saving Private Ryan, too, much of it from Tom Hanks' central performance. His laconic comment when a German on a loudspeaker announces the Statue of Liberty is kaput is priceless, and even as the body count mounts, there is a sense of this somehow being made endurable by the company of Miller and his men. Hanks keeps his schtick in harness most of the time, but when he does allow for some jocularity, we are actually grateful.The film slips a couple of times, but not in any major way. The biggest misstep for me was when Miller goes off and cries after losing one man. It's the one episode of actorly indulgence in a film that otherwise steers clear of such theatrics, though it may work for others.Even the final battle for the town of Remmel, though fictional, is done in a realistic and committed way. Some of the most violent and gruesome moments occur here, and they are all the more difficult to endure because we now know the soldiers fighting and dying in a way we didn't at Omaha.The music by John Williams and the cinematography by Janusz Kaminski are simply brilliant, neither calling your attention as they serve their scenes in an efficient manner.

Some might find this concept amusing (which would explain why a piece of garbage like Showgirls has such a big cult following ... although I'm sure that all the gratuitous sex and nudity helped out, as well), but I simply see no point to it. However, I'm willing to set my personal dislike of Verhoeven aside for a second and attempt to give an objective review of his 1990 sci-fi action thriller, Total Recall. And objectively speaking, this movie stinks. It's just not a good movie. And what's worse is that it's an especially bad movie. While at times I suppose the ludicrousness of the entire thing is mildly funny, most of the time it's just, well, ludicrous. Bad acting, bad script, bad filming, bad effects. Bad, bad, bad. It's really the only word that can adequately describe this joke of a film. Based upon We Can Remember it For You Wholesale, yet another brilliant Philip K. Dick short story is turned into mush when in the wrong hands. And in this case, those hands belong to Verhoeven (Starship Troopers, Hollow Man), a man known for distributing such words of wisdom as I love nudity and violence.

The script -- which, having had SIX screenwriters, leaves me to wonder which one thought Schwarzenegger would look good in a turban, and whether he was the same genius that came up with Ronny Cox's brilliant line, I'll blow this place up and be home in time for corn flakes! -- is just tragic.

I can just see Verhoeven and his six screenwriters sitting around a table and remarking on how brilliant the concept (which has something to do with dreams and implanted memories) is, when it's really just mush. And in the end, the entire movie is mush. And it's bad mush, at that. Maybe if it had a good sense of humor about how bad it was, it could have worked as a guilty pleasure. But instead it comes off more like Sean Young auditioning for Tim Burton as Cat Woman it's just sad.

Although it has been called the Mexican Pulp Fiction, I fail to see the connection except that both deal with lowlifes and jump around with time. Other than that, there are no real similarities.Like Pulp Fiction, though, it's divided up into segments. The first deals with Octavio (Gael Garcia Bernal) who is madly in love with his sister-in-law Susana (Vanessa Bauche) so he uses their dog Cofi to fight for money to run away with. Second is Daniel (Alvaro Guerrero) whose marriage to model Valeria (Goya Toledo) is jeopardized when their dog Richie falls underneath their apartment. Last is former guerillia El Chivo (Emilio Echevarria) who is assigned to murder someone, and also finds a wounded dog to take care of.All three stories are brought together by a car crash, each in a separate way. And all three stories show how important dogs are to people. In all of them, the owner of the dog is more concerned about the canine than other people. It could be showing the alienation of culture, but it could just be showing us three stories of people down on their luck in Mexico City.I am a big animal lover, and it was rather painful to watch so many dogfights and dogs in peril, but at least barely any of the fighting was shown. It seems at times like Amores Perros goes for shock value, with the sudden fights and the gritty feel and the strong animal gore, to make us choose how we feel. Also, the music sways us, although it's quite good.

Growing up in Texas, he lived with a family that was totally dysfunctional. He grew up in a shack, that had nothing more than a dirt floor. The father being a legless alcoholic, literally as well as figuratively. The mother worked as a prostitute. Henry was also forced into sexual activity with her clients. They forced him to dress as a girl and then would proceed to have sex with him. He was a child that grew up being raped.  He then grew up with such an intense rage that he became a serial killer. Are we surprised? Now, I am not trying to justify his behaviour. Rather, I am pointing out the fact that these people do not just fall out of the sky. There is no such thing as an inexplicable evil. That is, the person is just evil because they are. Yes, there seems to be some genetic evidence  for psychopaths. However the majority do not become killers. The ones who become killers are made. If you are truly interested in what makes a psychopath, I suggest you read, 'Not Guilty by reason of Insanity ' by Dorothy Otnow Lewis. Serial killers are often portrayed as being like Hannibal Lecter. Smart and talented creatures that have suddenly lost their moral code. The truth is most are a psychological mess. Losers that are full of conflicting emotions. There is also strong evidence to suggest that these people are made by a specific form of brain damage. Basically when you combine trauma in childhood and frontal lobe brain damage, you end up with Henry.  This movie is what happens when people are treated in an utterly horrific way. Michael Rooker is excellent as a psychopath who seems normal but deep down harbours a psychotic rage against society. He and Otis travel around killing. Why? Why not? The pointlessness of their lives is perfectly captured. People complain about the lack of plot. I think it perfectly captures the plot. It shows the emptiness of these characters. In fact Henry and Otis feel nothing unless they are killing. The emotional side of the characters has been like killed off by previous abuses against them. They are not unlike the living dead. Even when Otis's sister shows some affection towards Henry he cannot reciprocate. He can't relate to people, he can only get off on torture and death. Yeah, this is shocking. But it is also incredibly sad.  Here in New Zealand there are many shocking drunk driving ads that they play to try and get people to stop this behaviour. I feel that this movie is like that. The movie is an ad for psychopaths, who they are and the dysfunctional psychological world that they inhabit. It is a film that honestly looks at these kinds of people. This certainly does not glorify these people, which is a criticism that has been levelled at the 'Silence of the Lambs' series. This is why I think it shocks people. The serial killer kills for visceral, physical pleasure. As Ted Bundy stated, 'I killed because I wanted to.' Maybe, this is where the film falls down. That the characters motivations are not explained well enough. But either way the viewer is given a shockingly realistic interpretation of a serial killers world. Obviously this is a film that was made on a budget! But this just adds to the bleakness. In fact Chicago looks dirty, grimy and not like somewhere that you would visit. The performances of the rest of the cast are pretty average if not bad. So the film has some definite flaws. The exploitation factor is there. But then I think of films like Baise Moi and this film has nothing on that!  Overall I think this is an objective look at a world that those of us who come from normal backgrounds will find horrific. A world that we prefer would never exist, but however does exist. Maybe one day, as our society matures these people will cease to exist. Stories like these will become completely fictional. I really hope for that day. 7 out of 10.

Serial killers are often portrayed as being like Hannibal Lecter. Smart and talented creatures that have suddenly lost their moral code. The truth is most are a psychological mess. Losers that are full of conflicting emotions. There is also strong evidence to suggest that these people are made by a specific form of brain damage. Basically when you combine trauma in childhood and frontal lobe brain damage, you end up with Henry.  This movie is what happens when people are treated in an utterly horrific way. Michael Rooker is excellent as a psychopath who seems normal but deep down harbours a psychotic rage against society. He and Otis travel around killing. Why? Why not? The pointlessness of their lives is perfectly captured. People complain about the lack of plot. I think it perfectly captures the plot. It shows the emptiness of these characters. In fact Henry and Otis feel nothing unless they are killing. The emotional side of the characters has been like killed off by previous abuses against them. They are not unlike the living dead. Even when Otis's sister shows some affection towards Henry he cannot reciprocate. He can't relate to people, he can only get off on torture and death. Yeah, this is shocking. But it is also incredibly sad.  Here in New Zealand there are many shocking drunk driving ads that they play to try and get people to stop this behaviour. I feel that this movie is like that. The movie is an ad for psychopaths, who they are and the dysfunctional psychological world that they inhabit. It is a film that honestly looks at these kinds of people. This certainly does not glorify these people, which is a criticism that has been levelled at the 'Silence of the Lambs' series. This is why I think it shocks people. The serial killer kills for visceral, physical pleasure. As Ted Bundy stated, 'I killed because I wanted to.' Maybe, this is where the film falls down. That the characters motivations are not explained well enough. But either way the viewer is given a shockingly realistic interpretation of a serial killers world. Obviously this is a film that was made on a budget! But this just adds to the bleakness. In fact Chicago looks dirty, grimy and not like somewhere that you would visit. The performances of the rest of the cast are pretty average if not bad. So the film has some definite flaws. The exploitation factor is there. But then I think of films like Baise Moi and this film has nothing on that!  Overall I think this is an objective look at a world that those of us who come from normal backgrounds will find horrific.

This happiness ends when his parents are killed by a rhinoceros and James is left in the care of his cruel aunts. After much misery and hard work, James gets some magic crocodile teeth from a mysterious old man.  These cause a peach to grow large in the back garden along with some big bugs.  The aunts use the peach to sell tickets but James gets inside and uses it to make a break for New York along with the other inhabitants of the peach.Based on a great little book by Roald Dahl, this film does a good job or harnessing the imagination of that work and putting it into a dark twisted reality that would have made him proud.  The animation is pretty good - not the computer generated stuff of Pixar but models that actually help to make the bugs feel realer!  The basic plot is very simple but spiced up by several imaginative little adventures and some colourful little musical numbers, which although not very catchy certainly have the usual charm of Randy Newman's stuff.The jokes are not very adult orientated but they are not so childish that adults will be turned off the film.  It pitches it just about right - with some nice dialogue and nothing too reliant on slapstick over gentle charm that is amusing and enjoyable if never really laugh out loud funny.The cast are OK, while Terry is quite bland as James his support cast is fine.  Lumley is good as one of the monstrous aunts and the bugs in the peach are all strong with work from Callow, Dreyfuss, Thewlis and Sarandon. A New York cameo from Mike Starr is a nice surprise at the end as well.Overall this is not a great film but it is light and amusing.

Indeed, the film is not shot as an epic with sweeping scenes of battles or with elaborate sets or special effects.  So why all the fuss?This film has grown in stature because of the brilliant acting of the two lead characters, the remarkably witty and clever dialogue, and the war-torn romance that is the heart of the picture.  In other words, it is an actor-driven film with a terrific script and a story about love, war, and politics, i.e., a formula for a masterpiece.Put simply, Ingrid Bergman is electric in this film.  She is stunningly beautiful and turns in a remarkable performance as the brave and sensual Ilsa.  Her facial expressions alone convey more than most actresses can do with monologues.  She convincingly plays a young women torn between her ideals and affection for her husband-mentor and her passion for Rick, the one true love of her life.Not to be outdone, Bogart's performance is probably the strongest of his career.  He simultaneously manages to play a self-absorbed sulking saloon keeper, passionate lover, and sentimental patriot.  Rick is a complex and deep character, deeply wounded by Ilsa's choice to leave him at a train station in Paris to tend to her once forsaken husband.On top of this passionate romance, the film is paced by its political subplot, which is all the more interesting since it was filmed during World War II.  The script deftly weaves jabs at the Nazis and packs political themes throughout.  Moreover, the superb script conveys complex character interactions and messages without hitting the viewer over the head with explanation or narration.  Nowhere is this more apparent than in the underlying negotiating between Captain Renault and Rick on a variety of topics throughout the film.Bolstering the performances of Bogart and Bergman is the heady acting of Henreid and Rains.  Indeed, Rains' performance as Captain Renault is one of the great buddy-womanizer roles of all-time.  He is simultaneously charming and without conviction.  Henreid delivers a terrific performances as the political icon Victor Laszlo.  He is both dashing and courageous without ever trying to overshadow Bogart.This is a great film that gets better each time you see it.

When this movie came out, I wanted to see it, but a friend told me the solution and I was disgusted.  ANOTHER movie based on this tired theory?  Aren't movies based on historical events supposed to try and work in the known facts?  I finally got the movie (free) and was appalled.  They worked in enough facts to prove to me they did some research, but then ignored things like what these women did prior to their deaths, who they were, what their lives were like.  These women were not a clique of unfortunates who hung around together, though they might have known one another.  I mean, they did the same thing and lived in the same area!  But are we supposed to believe the police were stupid enough to miss something like a group of friends being killed off one by one?  If there had been that connection, wouldn't that be the MAIN thing known about the Ripper?It just bothers me that they are still doing Ripper movies with the same tired solution in this day and age.

The best part of any Sorkin project is invariably the dialogue, and The American President pulls it off brilliantly, combining ironic satire and soul-stirring powerful speeches seamlessly in a way that's simply inspiring.As I scroll down this comments page, I see a lot of people complaining about the film's liberal bias.  Well, yeah, excuse me but duh, this is a film about a liberal democratic president.  In the US there's basically two choices of who will be in the White House - a Democrat or a Republican. (A lot of people criticize the West Wing for the same issue, although as a longer-running series it had more time to delve deeply into issues.)But one of the reasons I admired this film (and the West Wing), is for its courage not to back down from controversy.  It's not afraid to say something strong, at the risk of offending some members of the audience.  The producers could've chosen some unimportant issues for the political subplots, but instead chose gun control and the environment, two extremely controversial issues.  Love them or hate them, at least it's plausible to assume that these issues would cause a very close political fight in Washington.  Somehow I don't see the fictional President coming up shy of the votes needed to pass a bill saying that the sun will rise in the East tomorrow.  The issues HAD to be controversial in order to make the film work.And my personal politics aside, I think that's part of what makes this work. Nobody wants a waffling president afraid to take a stand on any issue. People want leadership.  When Michael Douglas delivers his speech to the press corps at the end, you feel a shift in the room - someone willing to take a stand for what he believes is the right thing for the people.If you disagree with the politics, fine, but the film is open and honest about its political agenda.  Unlike some movies (like Michael Moore's manipulative, dishonest Bowling for Columbine, for example, that takes advantage of an audience through false footage and misrepresentation of fact), this is a romantic comedy that also works as a political statement without being too self-important.It is funny seeing Martin Sheen as the Chief of Staff and not the President. I hadn't realized how much of the movie's cast went on to the West Wing. Besides Sheen, there's Joshua Malina, and I think I saw a few other familiar faces.  And Annette Bening shows glimpses of the talent that later became so obvious in performances such as American Beauty.Overall, I give this film a 9.  See it if you have the chance.
