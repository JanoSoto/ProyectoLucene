[{"date":"5 January 2013","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" It turned out that there was a lot more to this movie than I was anticipating when I decided to watch it. I watched it largely on the basis of Alec Baldwin, who's a pretty good actor. But at the same time I knew that the basic plot revolved around a kid from the wrong side of the tracks, so to speak, who gets sent to a snooty prep school after getting in some trouble at home. I figured this would turn out to be a pretty typical teen-style comedy, with the bad kid heading off to the good school and turning it upside down, with the movie becoming little more than sex and drugs. It's true that there's a lot of weed in this, but much to my surprise there's no sex and not even a hint of nudity. It actually turns out to be a fairly complex study of relationships and commitment and the importance of taking responsibility for your actions.Shawn Hatosy was Tim Dunphy - the kid who gets sent off to this school. We find out early on that he has a troubled home life, loyally devoted to his wheelchair bound little brother Jackie (Tommy Bone) but with a distant relationship with his father, who's played by Baldwin, and who seems to have time to do little else but play poker with his buddies. (As an aside, dad's buddies are played by a pretty decent cast of actors, including George Wendt and Richard Jenkins.) For much of the movie we know nothing about Tim's mother, except that she isn't there. When her absence finally gets explained, it resolves some of the issues about what's going on between Tim and his dad, and perhaps explains his dad's emotional emptiness.The prep school part of the story is also more interesting than expected at first glance. There's some teen cliché stuff going on, but really less than I expected. Yes, as I noted, there's a lot of weed smoked over the course of an hour and a half, and there's the requisite evil adult character, in this case represented by My. Funderburk, played by Timothy Crowe, but even Funderburke (while a bit ridiculous at times) is less over the top than most similar characters in teen movies. As I said, there's neither sex nor nudity in this, but there is a surprisingly well portrayed romance between Tim and Jane (played by Amy Smart) - a girl from the right side of the tracks. It's one of those unlikely and somewhat unbelievable romances that nevertheless worked in this case, and I thought that Hatosy and Smart were good together. Ultimately, of course, what hijinks there were at the school leads to problems, and Tim has to decide whether to take responsibility for his actions or not, and the revelation of why Tim's mother is absent even leads ultimately to a sort of warming in the relationship between Tim and his dad.This actually turns out to be a much more interesting movie than one might anticipate. In fact, although it's set in a prep school and is at times humorous, I wouldn't really call this a teen comedy at all. It's got too much going on for that; it raises too many issues to be dismissed as just that. It's surprisingly well done.

After how good I've heard this was, I went into this expecting Die Hard or Commando with jets. I couldn't have been more wrong. Top Gun is about this super cool guy named Maverick, played by Tom Cruise. He and Goose, his funny-best-friend-with-a-family-and-a-little-boy- and who's-death-you-could-predict-within-the-first-two-minutes are at the top of their class in flight school. They go to the big boy's league where Maverick meets and fall in love with his teacher, Charolette, played by Kelly McGillis, and the two of them have about as much chemistry between them as Cruise has had successful marriages. It's pretty funny how there's much more sexual tension and chemistry between Maverick and Goose and Maverick and his rival Iceman, who's the antagonist because the film tells us he is; however his only crime for ¾ of the film is being the only character who tells Maverick he puts his squad in danger without kissing his butt in the same sentence. This film basically winds up being a really dull romance between Maverick and Charolette, with the actual plot nowhere to be seen as nothing ever really happens. Finally something does, in fact, happen, and there is some drama but by then it's too little too late. Some Russians show up in the last ten minutes so some explosions can get squeezed in at the end. Questions such as did this act of aggression lead to World War 3 are never answered. I also wonder why Russia's first move would be to shoot at two jets of trainees in the middle of nowhere. Move over, Pearl Harbor. There are some bright sides to the film, to be fair. They have some beautiful shots and stunts of the planes. The soundtrack is very love it or hate it, with 'Take My Breathe Away' and the ever classic 'Danger Zone'. You're only in danger if you watch this film and expect anything more than the dull, manliest chick flick in creation.

He's even more annoying than Hayden Christenson's Anakin Skywalker, which is saying a LOT. This was the first Star Wars movie where George Lucas brought in what were essentially cartoon characters, and there were times I didn't know whether I was watching a Star Wars movie or a space alien version of Roger Rabbit. I have the same complaint about this flick as I have about the other two prequels. Poor acting (except of course for the great Liam Neeson), boring characters (kind of goes with the bad acting, but also with poor character development), banal dialog, and a plot that takes a backseat to all those neat effects coming out of Skywalker Ranch. Plus there are too many unnecessary characters, Jar Jar being a prime example. But also, Liam Neeson notwithstanding, the Qui Gon character didn't need to be there either. They could have had Neeson play Obi Wan..he certainly would have been more interesting than Ewan McGregor, and Neeson's age was more in line with where Obi Wan's would have been 30 years earlier, given how old Obi Wan looked in the first Star Wars. Mcgregor was too young looking, which hurt the story's continuity. Ditto Anakin Skywalker. He should already have been a teenager at this stage. That said, as much as Jake Lloyd got panned for his performance, I actually thought the kid did OK with what he had to work with (especially when held up next to Christenson in the subsequent flicks). There were also unnecessary plot devices which added nothing to the story (i.e. Padme's double.) The bottom line is that I didn't care much about what happened to any of the characters. No amount of action and dazzling computer effects can make up for that (I had the same problem with the old Battlestar Galactica, which had Star Wars type of effects, but again, characters that did not draw me in). On the plus side, besides Liam Neeson, one of the finest actors of his generation (like Alec Guinness, he can take boring dialog and make it interesting), Phantom Menace has the single best light saber sequence in the history of the franchise. You don't realize how slow and lumbering the sword fights in the first three movies are until you see the Mach I pacing in this one. Other than the fact that he looks like a multi-horned Satan, Darth Maul is actually pretty bland until you see him fight..ninja style with his double ended light saber. Fun stuff.Overall, Phantom isn't bad..but it could have been better.

This movie is also unique in every sense. Even though the movie is targeted for children and is the movie that every single child watches during their child hood, its so good that even adults absolutely love it.The film follows the tale of Andy's toys who are, unknown to all humans, actually alive. During the movie, as Buzz, Andy's new toy comes, Sheriff Woody becomes jealous of Buzz as he becomes Andy's new favorite and attempts to put an end to it but Buzz gets his revenge. However, the two get captured by Sid, the evil kid next door that enjoys torturing toys and must try their best to escape. To be fair, this movie is one of the shortest films I've ever seen but also one of the most enjoyable.The voice acting for the film is just masterful. Tom Hanks voice acting of Woody is just brilliant and Tim Allen as Buzz was brilliant. The voice acting just added further strength to every aspect of the film.The animations for a 1995 film, being the first 3D animated film, is just visually amazing! Though it may not stand out against recent visual animations, this movie is just a joy to watch, even after 18 years! One thing that is incredibly cool is that they don't explain how exactly the toys ever were alive and its great to see such thing left anonymous. I also found the characters extremely entertaining and the way that Buzz and Woody become friends during the film is just well made! Also, having your main characters toys and in fact making a movie entirely based on toys can be some pain and something which people just laugh at but in this film, we as an audience are emotionally connected to these plastic toys! Its because, despite being toys, the director portrays these as human like things which makes it extremely interesting to us. The dialogue in the film is great and as a result it constantly made me laugh. I loved that little kid as a villain. I thought he was fascinating and I'm glad that very little time is spent about Andy. Despite being made for children all adults are sure to have a blast with this film. In fact, I don't see why nobody has yet to see this film. In case you haven't, be sure to remember that this film changed all animation films to come and that this is surely one of Pixar's ever most finest films!

Nearly all of the music on the soundtrack consists of blues-infused, upbeat country style which is consistent with the setting of this movie but not necessarily the tone. There is a dark underlying element to this story, most notably in the evolution of the main character Willis, played so wonderfully and engagingly by Matthew McConaughey it makes one shake their head as to why he would continue to make useless romantic comedies these days. Willis begins the film as bright, optimistic, a loyal son and brother but upset about the way justice is mistreated in south Texas. Determined to right this wrong, he becomes enamored with the idea of robbing banks, justifying it by claiming that the banks are the real thieves and his form of stealing would simply be a little thief taking from a big one. Though many of the subsequent scenes are nothing original in this genre, simply derivative of Bonnie and Clyde or Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, the four leads are all very engaging and likable, especially McConaughey and Ethan Hawke. Linklater keeps the audience at a distance with the use of the awkward music and the lack of character depth. In many cases, the supporting cast is simply that rather than an opportunity to reflect the brothers' view of their lives and worldview. Nevertheless, the film is as a whole better than the most recent of its kind. It has an innocent-like quality to it thanks to the fervent belief of Willis Newtown doing this was simply a way to make money and for that reason there was no reason for them to stop.

The man is still currently active, has starred in over two thousand adult films, and is one of the few straight male performers who has a face and not just a name. For someone who bears the number one spot on AVN's The 50 Top Porn Stars of All Time, Jeremy is not exactly what'd you expect. He is a short, hairy, rotund little man, yet he has proved that size matters in the industry, and you're height isn't what it is.Jeremy states in Porn Star The Legend of Ron Jeremy that he began his career during the golden age of the adult industry, which was from roughly 1975 to 1983 we're told. Other adult film directors, such as Jim Holliday state that during that time, adult films were professionally made and could compete with any B-movie production from Hollywood. They had talent, they had a script, they had direction, and they had solid special effects. They weren't just complete porn, but had some inkling of substance, along the lines of the softcore stuff you get on CineMax after 1100 PM. Now, we're told, the industry is over-glamorized, fake, lacks any form of substance, and due to performance-enhancing drugs like Viagra (which Jeremy is staunchly against, saying he wants to rely on himself rather than a drug), anyone can be a porn star in the current day and age.Jeremy grew up as Ron Hyatt, but adopted his middle name as his last name upon entering the industry. His father was a physicist, intelligent and supportive, but his mother was gravely ill with Parkinson's Disease, which led to her death shortly after being institutionalized in a nursing home. Jeremy went on to study acting and used education as a fallback career, obtaining a master's degree teaching special education. All he ever wanted to be was a performer, but an acting job is not a stable career, as we all know, and work in 1970 New York was difficult to come by. He feared that he'd never get the break he rightfully deserved because he'd never get the chance to show people he was a good actor since there was an appalling lack of work.After his girlfriend posted a naked picture of him in the new issue of Playgirl magazine, Jeremy seriously considered a career in the adult industry and began his odyssey in the 1970's, going on to star in well over two-thousand adult pictures and several mainstream films directed by the likes of Trey Parker, Adam Rifkin, and Troy Duffy. During the course of the documentary, we speak to people like Rifkin and Duffy, who recall working with The Hedgehog himself. Other interviews conducted are with industry stars such as Jenna Jameson and Tabitha Stevens, who recalls Jeremy's sweet personality as something light years more attractive than a bodybuilder's arrogant one.For a man seemingly having the job almost any male would want, Jeremy seems to be a rather undesirable man, chubby, hairy, and always appearing dirty, as we're told. Yet he's sweet, charismatic, always funny, cracking jokes, a good actor, and well-built, which is why he's achieved so much likability over the years and been so reliable. Even Holliday states that if you wanted a person to be a diverse actor in an adult film, you'd be hardpressed to find someone more qualified than Ron Jeremy.Yet this is where Jeremy begins to reflect on his career with sadness and the looming idea of feeling unfulfilled. He has always wanted to be a screen performer, and he has rightfully so been on the set of several films, doing little cameos and whatnot, but due to his profession and history, he is often the subject of much ridicule and joke to the point where many question if he can be taken seriously in a mainstream work. I think in even just his cameos he has proved he can. If Jeremy were to make a film tomorrow, I wouldn't hesitate to see it.Porn Star The Legend of Ron Jeremy, at seventy-four minutes, is a complete documentary, revealing, informative, and oddly enough, charming in its own right, examining a controversial industry and one of the most recognized performers in it. It neglects to provide a strong enough commentary on the industry from Jeremy himself, who briefly responds to the public's long-term idea that it degrades women, but having the title character be the concept of a full-length documentary is nonetheless a substantial one and the result is successful and highly entertaining.

I'm at a loss when it comes to films based on Hunter S. Thompson's iconic works. I adore his writing style; after reading his novel Hell's Angels The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs I felt I was transported to another world and was reading a newspaper story of an event covered by the event itself. Thompson wrote in a way that almost personified the story into feeling like you were given a firsthand account what was happening if the story wanted you to know itself. He labeled it as gonzo journalism, and one of the rules of gonzo journalism was before you could write the story, I assume, you had to get stoned to the point of being almost incomprehensible.But even if our writer at hand was incomprehensible through much of his publications, he found a way to make it all work to the level of professionalism and earned a heavy cult following that admired his writings, articles, and several film adaptations such as the 1980's film, Where the Buffalo Roam (unseen by me) and the most recent, The Rum Diary. However, no matter how hard I try, I can not seem to connect on a solid level with any film made off the works of Thompson and this is consistently isolating me from the cultists I so dreadfully want to connect with. I can admire Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas way more than I can recommend or even like it. There's a lot it does on the level of uniqueness and rebellion, yet there's little it does to give us clear insight as to what this whole trip represents.Our heroes are journalist Raoul Duke (Johnny Depp) and his alleged attorney Dr. Gonzo (Benicio Del Toro), who we first see speeding through the deserts of Nevada in a bright red convertible under the influence of mescaline, cocaine, marijuana, and several other drugs kept in their large suitcase that's stashed away in the trunk. They are heading down to the Nevada city to cover the Mint 400 motorcycle race, so Duke can beat the deadline for his article.One of the first scenes we are brought with is Duke in a mescaline-induced haze, swatting at a swarm of bats only visible to him. From there on out, it's complete and total madness. Duke and Gonzo blaze through the hallucinated backdrops of Las Vegas, under the influence of drugs a man of an unhealthy, unstoppable addiction probably wouldn't touch, lumbering from setup to setup, causing havoc, threatening violence, or simply envisioning things that are not there.The rest of the film I'm torn. On one hand, I see it as a possible commentary on God knows what. On the other, I see it as an exercise in insanity. I've read up on multiple interpretations and can't seem to agree or come to a solid understanding on any of them. Some have said it represents the death of the American Dream (as hinted in the book's title, Duke and Gonzo are searching for the American Dream), yet I am unable to look past the idea that two archetypes hopping from a ridiculous drug-fueled cacophony to another isn't representing the philosophy and idea of success in America.

I'm at a loss when it comes to films based on Hunter S. Thompson's iconic works. I adore his writing style; after reading his novel Hell's Angels The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs I felt I was transported to another world and was reading a newspaper story of an event covered by the event itself. Thompson wrote in a way that almost personified the story into feeling like you were given a firsthand account what was happening if the story wanted you to know itself. He labeled it as gonzo journalism, and one of the rules of gonzo journalism was before you could write the story, I assume, you had to get stoned to the point of being almost incomprehensible.But even if our writer at hand was incomprehensible through much of his publications, he found a way to make it all work to the level of professionalism and earned a heavy cult following that admired his writings, articles, and several film adaptations such as the 1980's film, Where the Buffalo Roam (unseen by me) and the most recent, The Rum Diary. However, no matter how hard I try, I can not seem to connect on a solid level with any film made off the works of Thompson and this is consistently isolating me from the cultists I so dreadfully want to connect with. I can admire Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas way more than I can recommend or even like it. There's a lot it does on the level of uniqueness and rebellion, yet there's little it does to give us clear insight as to what this whole trip represents.Our heroes are journalist Raoul Duke (Johnny Depp) and his alleged attorney Dr. Gonzo (Benicio Del Toro), who we first see speeding through the deserts of Nevada in a bright red convertible under the influence of mescaline, cocaine, marijuana, and several other drugs kept in their large suitcase that's stashed away in the trunk. They are heading down to the Nevada city to cover the Mint 400 motorcycle race, so Duke can beat the deadline for his article.One of the first scenes we are brought with is Duke in a mescaline-induced haze, swatting at a swarm of bats only visible to him. From there on out, it's complete and total madness. Duke and Gonzo blaze through the hallucinated backdrops of Las Vegas, under the influence of drugs a man of an unhealthy, unstoppable addiction probably wouldn't touch, lumbering from setup to setup, causing havoc, threatening violence, or simply envisioning things that are not there.The rest of the film I'm torn. On one hand, I see it as a possible commentary on God knows what. On the other, I see it as an exercise in insanity. I've read up on multiple interpretations and can't seem to agree or come to a solid understanding on any of them. Some have said it represents the death of the American Dream (as hinted in the book's title, Duke and Gonzo are searching for the American Dream), yet I am unable to look past the idea that two archetypes hopping from a ridiculous drug-fueled cacophony to another isn't representing the philosophy and idea of success in America.

It manages the neat trick of being fairly classy and rather trashy at the same time, as De Palma brings all of his directing skill to bear. This may not be his best but it's certainly one of his most well known, thanks in no small part to the excellent star trio of Michael Caine, Angie Dickinson, and Nancy Allen; Allen, of course, was married to De Palma at the time.Caine plays an eminent psychiatrist, Dr. Robert Elliott, and Dickinson portrays Kate Miller, one of his patients who's not getting any sexual fulfillment in her life. Unfortunately, once she is able to experience an afternoon of passion the satisfaction is short lived, as a tall, cold looking blonde woman in sunglasses and trenchcoat slashes her to death with a straight razor. (This has to rank as one of the scariest ever elevator rides captured on film.) A witness on the scene is high priced call girl Liz Blake (Allen), who's accused of the crime after stupidly picking up the murder weapon. So she ends up working with Kate's son Peter (Keith Gordon) to try to identify the woman, who Liz and Peter guess to be another of Elliott's patients.In the opening minutes of his film De Palma shows you what you're going to be in for, showing Dickinson pleasuring herself in the shower (intercutting shots of Dickinson with those of a body double) until a male stranger materializes behinds her and starts forcing himself on her. The combination of sex and danger is always stressed in this movie; as we will learn our killer has some severe psycho sexual problems. There are some highly memorable sequences, such as an extended seduction taking place inside an art museum, that being followed by a steamy coupling in the back of a cab. Other aspects that make it effective are Jerry Greenberg's editing (this was the man that cut The French Connection, after all), Ralf Bode's widescreen cinematography, and Pino Donaggio's haunting music.The actors each get an impressive showcase; both Dickinson and Allen look amazing to boot. Included in the cast are Dennis Franz as the investigating detective, David Margulies as the psychiatrist who explains everything for us in the end in case we didn't already get it, William Finley who does some uncredited voice work, and Brandon Maggart in a brief bit as a john.Overall, the film has a definite ability to get under one's skin. It's often genuinely spooky and could easily shock more sensitive viewers due to the level of sexual frankness on display.

The first half-hour, focusing on Christopher Plummer as Rudyard Kipling, feels like something to be endured. The second half-hour, the trek of Daniel and Peachy, reaches for an epic feeling, gets close, but lacks depth, lacks any sense of spiritual struggle by these men to get to their destination. (It's possible that this lack of spiritual struggle is a deliberate choice by the writers, i.e., the two men struggle physically but not spiritually, they do not grow, and this is the core reason for their later problems. Still, the trek needs more juicy danger and less fake snow.) Sean Connery, whose work I generally like, seems not well-suited to the broad, blarney-filled character of Daniel. He's trying too hard. He's far better at relaxed elegance. Saeed Jaffrey as Billy Fish is one-dimensional; the actor is talented but the role is pinched and thus is irritating at times. That said, Jaffrey's last moment is absolutely superb.Michael Caine is perfect as Peachy - exactly the right tone. The film's physical settings are mostly uninspired. The terrain, when they finally arrive at their destination, is ordinary, even a bit dry and dull, when we want gorgeous.The room full of treasure exemplifies for me one of the film's problems. The room has no magic to it whatsoever, it's just a pedestrian room full of not-very-gleaming gold, and un-cut big rubies that don't say big rubies so much as they say boring rocks. Huston decides with this treasure room to emphasize stark historical realism, to make us aware of the fact that rubies were probably not cut to gleaming perfection in the day of Alexander the Great. Huston thus abjures magic and fantasy. This is a mistake. We want magic and fantasy. They are fundamental to how we think of history, deep-down. Huston's basic problem, which he never resolves, is, how do I treat history? What is my conception of the past? Do I want to make a fun historical fantasy or do I want to make something real, something with the gritty, stark feeling of historical reality to it, as in my earlier project The Red Badge of Courage? Or....can I perform a miracle and stitch together the two genres?Raiders of the Lost Ark, six years after The Man Who Would Be King, achieves the miracle that Huston probably thought he could achieve. Raiders recognizes that if a history film receives a light seasoning of magic, if the director makes a significant-but-not-heavy-handed commitment to glittering fantasy, the project can click nicely, can bring to the surface our unconscious fantasies about the past - that it's a place of magic and mystery. (I'm not saying the past is actually magical. I'm saying that's how we feel about it, deep-down.) Connery's last shot is good.

Almost all of his films contain humour and some (like The Trouble With Harry) are overtly comic, but they all retain macabre or thriller elements. This on the other hand is in the classic style of the time - you can almost see Hepburn and Tracy in the roles - and as such it seems a little contrived in Hitchcock's hands. It's a lot of fun though, with good dialogue, and fine performances from all three leads; Montgomery (the father of Bewitched TV star Elizabeth) is agreeably resigned to his life's complications, Lombard is terrific as always as the needy, sulky, over-analysing shrew, and Raymond is wonderfully patient and strait-laced as the third point of an extremely grating love triangle. There are plenty of funny moments to keep it going, like the dialogue about the cat or the scene in the bathroom with the noisy plumbing, but it doesn't have the tension or objective sweep we are accustomed to with Hitch's films. All in all, a pleasant flick to catch on a slow evening but not the kind of movie we'd expect from the master of suspense.
