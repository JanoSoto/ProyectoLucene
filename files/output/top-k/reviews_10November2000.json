I just saw this film at a free sneak preview, and although I already decided I wouldn't pay for it if I had to, I figured, what the hell.  They were giving out free soundtracks and T-Shirts to those that came, so I was already in pretty good spirits about the movie.So the movie started, so far so good.  My friends are asking me if I wanted to leave.  It was only 10 minutes into the film, not enough time for me to detect anything wrong with a film...for me anyway.  About 30 minutes into the film, I realized why it was free.  An hour and a half into the film, I realized this thing was never going to end.  I was just waiting for it to end so I could leave.  Whatever the makers of Red Planet were trying to make fell flat halfway into the movie, and shortly after that, I realized it died and was never going to come back to life.  The rest of the movie wasted time and failed to excite or entertain me.I'm usually very patient with films, so don't gang up on me and tell me that long films with very little action bore me, because it's not true.  If Red Planet had something to say, I'd be very interested and enthused.  Red Planet was lacking plotwise and although the characters received a lot of screentime, I never really understood who they were.  I think they were trying to develop the characters after years of sci-fi films that go for the effects and overlook the characters.  Despite their efforts, they failed.  On a technical note, Red Planet is superb.  The effects and photography are very good, and the aura of sound will knock your socks off!  However, effects and sound are not essential to storytelling.  It's interesting that Carrie-Ann Moss was in this film.  She hardly does anything, and her lack of humor is never really explained(I don't know how I could've missed an explanation, but I did).  Also, she was in The Matrix, another effects and sound bonanza.  However, The Matrix had developed characters, and it had a plot, which is what made it work.I wouldn't call Red Planet a terrible film.  It's technically superb, and they did try to make a good film.  And even if nothing happens in a film, that doesn't bother me.  The problem was they forgot a plot and didn't know how to develop the characters.  Without those essential elements in a film, it can make a film with a promise a long, boring failure.

The movie has a strangely familiar beginning. A man running away from hooded cult members. Wasn't this how Halloween 6 started?

The Den however becomes a sensation because the eager public flocks to see the rats, er, Ghoulies. But everything is threatened again once the ghoulies start killing people.There is also a insipid romantic subplot, but I don't want to spoil anything.

The dramatic music by Bernard Herrmann greatly added to my overall enjoyment of the film.  This is a fast moving witty thriller in magnificent Technicolor with Cary Grant as Roger O. Thornhill giving the performance of a lifetime. Grant is mistaken for government agent George Kaplan and is thrust into one life threatening situation after another on the run from both the police and the bad guys! It's a roller coaster ride of thrills, suspense, comedy and romance skilfully put together with the expert Hitchcock touch. There are some spectacular set pieces in unusual locations such as the United Nations Building, New York's Grand Central Station, Mount Rushmore and who can forget the famous crop dusting sequence at Prairie Stop on deserted Highway 41.  Cary Grant wears the same suit throughout the film but stil manages to look as elegant as ever despite the many tricky and dangerous situations he finds himself in!  James Mason has never been better as the sinister Phillip Vandamm intent on eliminating Cary with the help of his two menacing associates Adam Williams and Robert Ellestein who played their villainous parts very convincingly. Eva Marie Saint was the usual Hitchcock ice cool blonde heroine while Jessie Royce Landis was excellent as Cary Grant's mother although in reality she was only a few months older than Grant! (They were both born in 1904). This actress was also with Cary Grant in another Hitchcock film to Catch a Thief in which she played Grace Kelly's mother. Martin Landau was impressive in his first screen role as the vicious Leonard trying to get rid of Cary at every opportunity! Veteran actor Leo G. Carroll was making his sixth appearance in a Hitchcock film as the CIA\/FBI Agent known only as the Professor. One of my favourite actresses Doreen Lang had the small part of Grant's secretary Maggie and can also be seen in other Hitchcock films such as The Wrong Man and The Birds. Surprisingly, North by Northwest did not win any Oscars and Hitchcock, Cary Grant and the film itself were not even nominated which in retrospect was a regrettable oversight. It was unfortunate that this was the year when Ben Hur scooped the awards and won an amazing total of 11 Oscars. The films nominated for Best Picture that year were Ben Hur (the winner), Anatomy of a Murder, Diary of Anne Frank,  The Nun's Story and Room at the Top.

Surprisingly, North by Northwest did not win any Oscars and Hitchcock, Cary Grant and the film itself were not even nominated which in retrospect was a regrettable oversight. It was unfortunate that this was the year when Ben Hur scooped the awards and won an amazing total of 11 Oscars. The films nominated for Best Picture that year were Ben Hur (the winner), Anatomy of a Murder, Diary of Anne Frank,  The Nun's Story and Room at the Top.  Looking at these titles today it is unbelievable to me that North by Northwest could not have been included in the nominations.  The best actor Oscar went to Charlton Heston for Ben Hur and the other nominees were Laurence Harvey (Room at the Top), Jack Lemmon (Some Like It Hot), Paul Muni (The Last Angry Man), and James Stewart (Anatomy of a Murder). Ernest Lehman's Oscar nominated story and screenplay was full of gems including Jessie Royce Landis asking the would-be assassins You gentlemen aren't really trying to kill my son are you?. And Grant to Leo G. Carroll I'm an advertising man, not a red herring! I've got a job, a secretary, a mother, two ex wives and several bartenders dependent upon me and I don't intend to disappoint them all by getting myself slightly killed!.  A Hitchcock masterpiece. 10\/10.  Not to be missed. Clive Roberts.

'SP B,L & U' is one of the FUNNIEST movies I have ever seen!!! It's ridiculously disgusting, painfully funny and undoubtedly original - Trey Parker and Matt Stone were great making this film, because A) they were original and B) they broke all the rules and weren't afraid to do so.And while, you'll never come across anything so gross in your whole entire life, you probably won't come across anything so damn funny either!! Whether it's Cartman's hippy-bashing, Terrance and Phillips' #1 singles or Chef's sexual advice, you won't be able to stop yourself from laughing at this little gem.However, the movie is very obscene - a swear word is uttered every like ½ second, there's more sexual references and gestures than Showgirls, and more violence than in Scream!!But towards the end, I got a little tired of all the songs. Uncle #@^&%!, It's Easy Mmmmkay and Kyle's Mom's A Bitch (In D Minor) were no doubt the best, but there are also some that you feel are 'dragged through' and are more or less boring.I'm sick of all the negative feedback South Park gets (especially about this movie) - it's an original, funny, imaginative concept which works very well with sick-humoured teenagers (as Box Office receipts will show you).

I have a real problem with motion sickness, and only had to glance away once from the rickety camera handling.  I did find it a very interesting film, frightening in its realism and well worth seeing.

You get to watch them get lost, and resolve it by screaming eff words at eachother (very productive) and actually attacking eachother physically because they are so incapable of dealing with crisis.  I felt so sorry for Heather, who is stuck with these two Simian idiots through most of the film and has to put up with their complete lack of humanity by any definition.  She's the only one with sense, and there's no question that this Project was about the challenge of working with assigned partners rather than people Heather might have selected herself....Watch them blame each other and spend their vocal cords on pointless, endless profanity, then turn on Heather in violent assault.  Their immaturity and barbarism cost the group its unity, the one thing that could have saved them all. After that it's just Divide and Conquer, the unknown forces taking advantage of the group's fear, chaos and instability, and picking them off one by one.

I don't know if it's a horror film or an exercise in gender comparison and typical, stereotypical male behavior, but The Blair Witch Project is certainly a creative and disappointing look at American youth gone wrong.  Interwoven with this is a macabre fable about The Blair Witch herself, who does a number on these three would-be documentary filmmakers. It has moments of humor, fright and strangeness (I am still not 100% clear on the ending), and is worth seeing for its shockingly real presentation of a one-of-a-kind story.

While the books do manage to remain faithful to scripture, their methods of fulfilling prophecy are often ridiculous (an example is their explanation for the Russian\/Arab invasion of Israel). Also, the books have an unmistakable preachy tone that will turn off unbelievers rather than bring them to the gospel. Still, I found myself reading these books because of my interest in the events of Revelation. For a similar reason, I watched this film adaptation. I am sad to say that it is a rather mediocre film bordering on poor. The acting is actually rather decent for the most part with occasional bits of poor acting and over-acting. The script is rather bad, though it is hardly unexpected when starting with the novel as a basis. The characters are poorly drawn and underdeveloped. Events feel scattered and disconnected. The dialogue sometimes sounds rushed. At least the book managed to flesh out its hokey conspiracy theory. Here, the viewer is left with an incoherent mess that only makes much sense if one has read the book. The pacing of the film is also very poorly executed with the opening and conclusion seeming extremely rushed, and the middle dragging to an excruciatingly slow trudge that makes it feel padded. The music is schizophrenic. At times, it successfully underscores the mood and sounds fitting for a motion picture. At other moments, it reminds me of sitcom and mini-series music. And still other bits remind me of a poppy MTV soundtrack that just doesn't belong in the film. I can give the film points for the scene of panic on board the plane, but that's it. The other scenes involving the disasters after the Rapture are far from compelling. The film also suffers from the book's preachiness although its message isn't quite as in your face. In all, I found the movie just as disappointing as the series. This is not the film to rally Christians around it. I hope that this film does NOT get any attention at the theaters next year. It would be more unnecessary bad publicity for Christianity. For an example of a compelling, intelligent, well-researched series based on Revelation that presents a realistic and Christian world view without offending the secular reader (who after all should be whom a Christian is trying to reach) read the Christ Clone trilogy by James BeauSeigneur. It's a great read and is a much better choice for unbelievers or believers who appreciate quality.

So if thats your attitude and you loved the first film, then best just stay at home and not disappoint yourself.  But for the rest of us free thinking open minded individuals, it may be worth taking a look see.  I have to admit that I was expecting this to be terrible, but I was shocked to find that it wasn't.  The acting is fine (no oscars here though), but the actual plot line and how it is tied to the first film is actually quite clever. It's all about expectation, this film is a not half bad teen shlocker in the final scream at the faculty last summer mould.  Pick up your popcorn, take out your brain and you may just enjoy this.

But his dying is what made the movie unique to me. Not your typical Hollywood ending.  I think if he had lived his pay it forward plan would have fizzled out. But because he died - and it was clear that so many people were touched by his plan, as well as the charm he exuded during the television interview earlier that day - the film suggested to me that the idea would indeed endure. In my first sentence I said I found the movie uplifting - and I did. Osment's death was not a downer to me because of the optimism i just expressedI personally have several friends who have seen this film attempt to start their own chain of good deeds. Wouldn't it be wonderful if that  really happened and REALLY worked?? Just call me a sentimental fool....

To me it seemed that ever aspect of this film was overdone for more of a dramatic effect from the simple eye staring when Ethan and Nyah first saw each other to the outrageous bike chase at the end.Despite the fact that this was initially a t.v. series, I believe the pace of the films were set with the first movie. This movie totally went beyond realism and went into total stupidity. Am I to believe that at the end of the film when the bike chase was going on that and they were heading at each other at what seemed 90 miles per hour each \/ BUT WAIT, lets lessen that. Lets say they were going 40 miles per hour each. The impact that they hit each other when they jumped off the bikes would still be 80 miles per hour. LET'S GO EVEN FURTHER. Had they survived that hellish impact, they would not be able to jump back up and start pounding on each other in a full fight. Like I said it was too unrealistic.The music during the action scenes were also too much. Just shoot the damn gun and scream. I don't need the music to make it sound dramatic.That is why I liked the first one so much more. It was believable, it had it's villains, as well as good guys. Then there were the people in between. It went to the edge of realism, but still kept you in the real world.Save your money for a good film.

The film's nice little twist is its script, by Leslie Dixon from Catherine Ryan Hyde's novel, which pulls us forward in time, then back again, then forward again. It's dizzying, and makes the story seem a whole lot more interesting than it actually is.  For the less sophisticated viewer, it will just be confusing--and this subject matter is not exactly the kind that draws crowds of intellectuals.Its characters, well portrayed by its dream cast (Kevin Spacey, Helen Hunt, Haley Joel Osment, Jay Mohr, Angie Dickinson, etc.), are so genuinely Real because (I guess) their lives suck so bad. For example, Arlene McKinney (Hunt) has two jobs and an alcoholic mother who ditched her as a kid, is an alcoholic in rehab herself and a former battered wife to top it off. It's good to put characters through a lot of challenges but this was ridiculous. No one's life is this terrible.New teacher Eugene Simonet (Spacey) gives his students an impossible assignment make the world a better place.

From his initial action, feeding and clothing a homeless drug-addict (Jim Caviezel), is formed an idea Perform conditional random acts of kindness. The condition is that if someone does something for you, you must do something nice for three other people. Trevor calls it pay it forward.Reporter Chris Chandler (Mohr) stumbles upon PIF in the film's staple-you-to-your-seat opening scene (it's great, it really is). From here he traces the phenomenon back from one person to another until he finds himself in the armpit of Las Vegas where it all began. Chandler's investigation, again, is the only reason this film worked for me. It's told concurrently with Trevor's story as it unfolds. We see the far-reaching results of Trevor's idea even as Trevor believes he's had no impact at all.This and the ending give the film a clear message just help one person and you already made the world a better place. Sometimes it's hard to do but that's why you have to do it. Like your grandpa used to tell you, anything that's worth having is worth fighting for...or something like that.
