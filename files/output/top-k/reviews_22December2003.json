I actually watch it quite a bit. One of the factors I ask for is a good rewatchability factor, and I Still Know What You Did Last Summer delivers on that level.--Though some of the plot twists aren't so good, I appreciated that I Still Know didn't just carry on with more murders but kept the story going as well as adding in new ideas and concepts, such as the history of Ben Willis and the family he had.--The setting for the film is beautiful. I loved the deserted island idea and dug that it took place in a storm (the rain machine is put to great to use). Having such a big setting allows for some great kills and lots of different places to have them.--The film is drenched in atmosphere. I loved the simple techniques used to create tension and suspense, such as the birds flying away when the killer enters the room (kick-ass cinematography), upwards shots of rain falling, the hook on the hand and the several different sets used for murders.--Ben Willis doesn't mess round! There is a truckload of gore and tons of bloody kills sure to please any horror buff!THE BAD--Stupid title. They didn't actually do anything last summer; it was two summers ago.--The editing of this film is shoddy to say the least. It looks like the actors had to go back into a studio and say their lines again while watching the movie and trying to fit in the dialogue like that a lot of the time, and it doesn't work. The words and mouth movements are out of time for a lot of the film.--Stupid characters are what we're used to in the teen horror genre, and this movie is a big thumbs up in that area (of course not a good thing). For example, when Julie is on the sun bed and the killer has turned up the heat and locked her in there. Julie's friends come in, panicking and going nuts and trying to bash it open. Why didn't they just rationally turn down the heat and figure out a way to open the sun box thing? Also they ditch each other too much instead of being safe, very frustrating.--One of the strong points of I Know What You Did Last Summer is that the killer had a real purpose behind his kills, but here Ben Willis just goes killing everyone for no reason. It makes the kills - albeit enjoyable - seem very pointless overall.RATING7\/10 - I may be in the minority, but I enjoyed this movie and had fun with it. It wasn't very well done or anything but hey I had fun and consider the movie a fun guilty pleasure.

At the start I had my doubts about his performance but as the movie went on he became more and more entertaining to watch.

We get the daggers, the warning person (the reporter this time) and that same wall thing we got last time. It makes the film seem like they had no ideas for a second movie, which makes me how the hell they're gonna come up with a good idea for the third film.--This movie is WAY too repetitive.

The film's storyline raises many issues of right and wrong and moral judgement, and how a person's place in society must influence their decision on how they practice the law. I also enjoyed messages and subtext showing how murder, whether in self-defence or pure viciousness, affect us. This is shown in a very subtle and respectable manner in a small moment near the end of the film where Nick Nolte is desperately trying to wash the blood of another man of his hands.--The performances in this film are astounding, especially from the phenomenal Robert DeNiro, who proves again just how much range he has. Juliette Lewis is also terrific and I really got the vulnerable yet strong feeling from her and she played the tormented teen very well, seeing the character from various angles. Nick Nolte and Jessica Lange were also respectable in their leading roles.--Cape Fear's best scene must go to the play theatre scene between the two best actors in the film - DeNiro and Lewis. They interact for what seems to be about 15 minutes, exchanging brilliantly constructed dialogue, their characters slowly building confidence around each other. It feels like one of the longest scenes in film history, it also feels like one of the best.--Martin Scorsese's direction of the film&#133;stylish, focused. He always keeps the suspense going, he has visual flair, makes simple shots look amazing and brings out the best in his actors. But that is of course what we've come to expect from this wonderful director after Raging Bull.--The cinematography in this film is very cool. I loved the use of red as a fade-in and fade-out, and the red skies were neat. The close-ups also helped with the intensity of some of the scenes, and also made me feel like I was watching the film at the theatre, which was a really neat feeling.--The score from the movie, especially the main theme, is thrilling and particularly memorable, I'll have that tune on my head for the rest of the week. THE BAD--The final showdown has a slightly weak ending. After all the build up I expected the send off of our main character to be more climactic, it kind of feels like a is that it? ending. It's frustrating that the flaw in the film is it's end, thus I left the film with a lower grade than I would have in the first hour and 45 minutes or so.--Robert DeNiro being attached to the bottom of the car?

Ryan Phillippe gives his first adult performance very well, putting on a believable accent and making his character very charming. Emily Watson is terrific as usual. Kelly MacDonald, the anchor of the film, is wonderful and gives a very underrated performance. Academy Award nominations went to the fairly good Helen Mirren and very funny Maggie Smith. Credit must also be given to Stephen Fry (a neat character in the film), Bob Balaban, Michael Gambon and the various other cast members.--Now that I think about it more, the main quality of the film is the way it manages to cleverly show the audience the way the house is run - separating servant from leisure man\/woman, rich from poor, rags to riches. Very neat factor in the film.--I loved the setting for the film. It gave it even more of an Agatha Christie feeling, and really made the whodunit story more atmospheric.

He executes the film very well and makes it feel like an Agatha Christie novel come alive in a stylish, intriguing manner.--The aforementioned giant cast of the film dazzles. Ryan Phillippe gives his first adult performance very well, putting on a believable accent and making his character very charming. Emily Watson is terrific as usual. Kelly MacDonald, the anchor of the film, is wonderful and gives a very underrated performance. Academy Award nominations went to the fairly good Helen Mirren and very funny Maggie Smith. Credit must also be given to Stephen Fry (a neat character in the film), Bob Balaban, Michael Gambon and the various other cast members.--Now that I think about it more, the main quality of the film is the way it manages to cleverly show the audience the way the house is run - separating servant from leisure man\/woman, rich from poor, rags to riches. Very neat factor in the film.--I loved the setting for the film. It gave it even more of an Agatha Christie feeling, and really made the whodunit story more atmospheric. The house itself looked delicious, marvellously decorated in several stunning and I'll bet expensive ornaments and jewels.THE BAD--There are no particularly memorable scenes or sequences in this film. When I look back on movies I love to think that part was my favourite or I'd see the movie all over again just to see that part! but I wasn't really mesmerised by this picture. It was somewhat forgettable.--This movie is too long. It could've been cut down considerably. If it had I feel the rating would've been higher as the other flaws don't compare so much to this MAJOR flaw. Three hours to tell this story is one hour and a half too much.--I was enthralled by the mystery of the film, and finding out whom the killer is kept me glued to my seat.

This doesn't make it a tedious  movie or anything, but it doesn't help the generally talky story along for audience  members who're convinced they've seen it all before. Scott knows how to make some  papers shuffled into an envelope exciting, but after an hour and a half I found myself  aching for the inevitable explosion. When there IS action, it's performed with a kind of  chipper proficiency. The cast and filmmakers' real relish here appears to be with the  characters and story (which, as a sidenote, is mildly informative) but what's the anchor  here? There's barely enough chutzpah in the dialogue & aesthetics to keep it interesting,  but never spectacular. Still, hats remain off to Scott and company for cutting it as close  as possible.

It's not Alfred Hitchcock; it's not even somebody trying to be Alfred Hitchcock.  For a director known for his tight plots, attention to detail, brilliant and innovative camera angles, unending suspense and getting the most from his actors, TORN CURTAIN fails on all fronts.  The pace is so sluggish and uneven that it makes Stanley Kubrick look exciting.  The plot is simply ludicrous, with far too many untenable points and downright errors and gaps to list here Flick a lighter in a house full of natural gas?  I doubt it.  Leave the party after only one dance and not attract suspicion?  Unlikely!.  Hitch and\/or his screenwriter(s) simply did not know how to -- or didn't make the effort to try to -- construct a plausible scenario of international intrigue. The cinematography is average at best, bad at worst.  The short shot of Prof. Armstrong (Newman) falling down the stairs is almost cartoonish. The fight scene is thoroughly contrived and so bad it is almost unwatchable. As for suspense, there is some, but it, like the plot, is uneven to the point where it loses its impact.  Most of the suspensful points -- such as Armstrong's and, later, Sherman's (Andrews') motives -- are resolved quickly, and early in the film.  TORN CURTAIN lacks the ongoing intensity and emotional absorption of nearly all of Hitch's other films.Finally, the acting, which is downright dreadful.  In addition to Hitch's name above the title, I looked forward to seeing Paul Newman and Julie Andrews perform together during their early years.  They try, but even these two great actors cannot redeem this picture.  Their performances are uninspiring to the point where they show little interest or emotional attachment to the events around them.  Paul Newman doesn't seem convinced that he himself is a brilliant scientist, so how could he convince the East Germans?  Julie Andrews fares a little better, but is still annoying in this role that, some say, she didn't really want.  The supporting cast, unfortunately, is far worse, made up of wooden characters who are entirely stereotyped and performed by either very bad actors or, at best, actors who Hitch made no effort to inspire.  The only brief glimpses of humanity are in Dr. Koska's daughter and the farmer \/ PI agent neither of whom, unfortunately, appear on screen long enough to redeem this amateurish production.Was Hitch lazy, inept, or distracted in his later years?

You don't even have to hear them say anything particularly funny to laugh at the sheer sight of the wacky duo lined up against one another, wearing the infamous clothing and sunglasses. And since their appearance on Saturday Night Live, and then later in their milestone feature film, they have infiltrated society.The Blues Brothers (1980) is, and will remain as far as I see it, the funniest SNL skit adaptation to ever hit the big screen. The problem with adapting characters from 5-minute skits on Saturday Night Live is the fact that they are just that -- 5-minute skits -- and are not substantial enough to merit any type of further focus. Backdrops are not needed -- all we need are quirky characters with distinguishing traits or gestures that will make us laugh.The Ladies Man, The Coneheads, A Night At the Roxbury, and Superstar are all examples of material stretched too far -- basically just skits multiplied by their original running length some 15 or so times. In fact, there are really only two or three feature length movies with SNL characters that are any good. I love Saturday Night Live, but even I have to admit that some things are not meant to be turned into a movie. I'd rather see a compilation of the character's best moments on the show hit the big screen as opposed to a weak plot-driven film about them doing many unfunny things a quarter as funny as anything on the television program.The Blues Brothers has a great plot (considering it's an SNL film) and a great pair of characters. Jake Blues (John Belushi) has just been released from prison, greeted by his taller (and more slender) brother Elwood (Dan Aykroyd). They visit the old Catholic home where they were raised as children by The Penguin, and are instantly thrust into a mission to save the orphanage by raising a ton of money before it is due to close.How will they do this? Reunite their old band, of course! But it won't be easy, because in the process they get entangled in the affairs of a Neo-Nazi and a heavily armed woman (cameo by Carrie Fisher). They also get entwined in a bunch of musical sequences with blues legends such as James Brown, Aretha Franklin, and Ray Charles. (John Candy also stars in this film, and in John Hughes' masterpiece Planes, Trains and Automobiles, he did the mess around to Ray Charles' song on the radio while driving an awful car.)It's all in the name of fun, of course. Oh, and in the name of God. Quoting Elwood, We're on a mission from God. Not exactly a laugh-out-loud line of dialogue, but the more you think about it, the funnier it becomes.All my readers are probably aware of the fact that I absolutely love Saturday Night Live and all its actors. (Well, most of them.) Especially the older posse of actors such as Bill Murray, Chevy Chase, Dan Aykroyd, Steve Martin (frequent guest host), John Belushi, et al. They're like dear old friends and every time I see them on old reruns of the television show I get instant nostalgia. When you become a fan of Saturday Night Live, you enter a sort of small group of friends you've never even met. You just somehow feel very close to the actors and their friends. John Landis, the film's director, was one of those close friends of Dan Aykroyd like Harold Ramis.The Blues Brothers are two of the best characters to ever come out of Saturday Night Live. We've seen a lot of characters like Mango and Mary Katharine Gallagher lately, but the best characters are the fondest -- Wayne and Garth, The Lounge Singer, The Coneheads, The Cheeseburger Guy, The Blues Brothers. And just about any character Steve Martin plays.I can't explain why I enjoy Saturday Night Live so much -- is it the humor? the acting? the familiarity feel? -- but I can say that I DO love it, and I love The Blues Brothers. Sequels can become nasty things or splendid things, and The Blues Brothers 2000, which reunited Aykroyd and Landis (the director), was a failure. A compilation of musical sketches and a terribly recycled plot, it was a sure sign that The Blues Brothers themselves worked not only because of Elwood but also because of Jake, and The Blues Brothers the movie worked not because of a recycled plot but because of an original one. (And here's advice for the filmmakers never, ever replace John Belushi with John Goodman ever, ever again.)I am sure that anyone who enjoyed Ghostbusters or any type SNL-alumni film will absolutely adore The Blues Brothers. I mean, this is the stuff legends are made of. Jake and Elwood Blues, two of the most familiar faces of all time. How can you not laugh at this film? It's impossible. Yes, it's a bit long, and yes, you have to sit through some blues music; but they're The Blues Brothers.

You don't even have to hear them say anything particularly funny to laugh at the sheer sight of the wacky duo lined up against one another, wearing the infamous clothing and sunglasses. And since their appearance on Saturday Night Live, and then later in their milestone feature film, they have infiltrated society.The Blues Brothers (1980) is, and will remain as far as I see it, the funniest SNL skit adaptation to ever hit the big screen. The problem with adapting characters from 5-minute skits on Saturday Night Live is the fact that they are just that -- 5-minute skits -- and are not substantial enough to merit any type of further focus. Backdrops are not needed -- all we need are quirky characters with distinguishing traits or gestures that will make us laugh.The Ladies Man, The Coneheads, A Night At the Roxbury, and Superstar are all examples of material stretched too far -- basically just skits multiplied by their original running length some 15 or so times. In fact, there are really only two or three feature length movies with SNL characters that are any good. I love Saturday Night Live, but even I have to admit that some things are not meant to be turned into a movie. I'd rather see a compilation of the character's best moments on the show hit the big screen as opposed to a weak plot-driven film about them doing many unfunny things a quarter as funny as anything on the television program.The Blues Brothers has a great plot (considering it's an SNL film) and a great pair of characters. Jake Blues (John Belushi) has just been released from prison, greeted by his taller (and more slender) brother Elwood (Dan Aykroyd). They visit the old Catholic home where they were raised as children by The Penguin, and are instantly thrust into a mission to save the orphanage by raising a ton of money before it is due to close.How will they do this? Reunite their old band, of course! But it won't be easy, because in the process they get entangled in the affairs of a Neo-Nazi and a heavily armed woman (cameo by Carrie Fisher). They also get entwined in a bunch of musical sequences with blues legends such as James Brown, Aretha Franklin, and Ray Charles. (John Candy also stars in this film, and in John Hughes' masterpiece Planes, Trains and Automobiles, he did the mess around to Ray Charles' song on the radio while driving an awful car.)It's all in the name of fun, of course.
