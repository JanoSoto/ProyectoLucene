A computer hacker, under the name of Neo, portrayed by Keanu Reeves, is drawn into this rebellion, and fight off against the machines. I'm obviously a fan of big sci-fi action thrillers that make you pay attention throughout. This movie is one of the best examples. The casting is golden, from Keanu Reeves' performance that left his signature as an actor, to Lawrence Fishburne as the mysterious leader of the Matrix, Morpheus. Hugo Weaving and Carrie-Annie Moss round up the supporting cast, and they perform just fine. But, my favorite thing about this movie, was all the incredible technological advantages that were added. This movie is filled with groundbreaking editing, fast-paced cinematography, astounding sound effects, and the jaw-dropping visual effects that are still memorable to this day. That slow-motion gun bullet scene is still quite memorable, you know! From the sharp well-written script, the incredible acting, the groundbreaking visual effects, to the smart directing of the Wachowskis, The Matrix is truly a favorite for all cinema lovers. It's a fun, non-stop, and exciting motion picture that will take away the 136-minute run time quickly. No wonder movies always go copy-cat on this movie!

The Breakfast Club is one of my all-time favorite movies. I can watch this over and over again, and I'm still entertained by what this movie has to offer.

This is a movie that I bet all audiences will relate to. This movie has consistent laughs, heartwarming messages, and memorable moments.

Andula is engaged with her boyfriend Tondo, but when she attends a social gathering with her friends Marie and Jana she meets a pianist named Milda and gets involved in a new romance.This slow-paced romantic comedy from the mid-1960s is a brilliantly written and directed social satire which portrays a young woman's non-conformist love life in a very low-keyed manner while making a sharp critique of notions of democracy during a period when the Czech government was still being ruled by a Communist regime. Slightly sad and charmingly humorous, this dialog-driven and condensed study of character from the Czechoslovak New Wave has a gifted cast primarily consisting of non-professional actors.The efficient bittersweet atmosphere which sets the tone and which is reinforced by the fine black-and-white cinematography by Milos Forman's frequent collaborator, Czech cinematographer Miroslav Ondríscek and the jazzy score by Czech composer Evzen Illín.

Not too surprisingly, the same reasoning can be applied for animation we're so used to CGI and 3D animated films that we forgot how groundbreaking Walt Disney's Toy Story was in 1995, and that we witnessed an event as historical as the release of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. It's not surprising by the way, that the two films are the only animated features included in the American Film Institute's Top 100 List.The comparison with Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs doesn't only rely on the technical achievement and the critical recognition, but also on what drove these two crucial aspects an endearing and universally appealing story. Snow White exploited all the comical possibilities of the dwarfs, in order to use physically distinct characters with different personalities attributed to each of them, while the Queen and Snow White could be modeled in more realistic designs; the setting also allowed the drawers to extend their talents and give it the touch of magic and exoticness the audiences needed back then. Toy Story does the exact same thing, it chooses the best setting that can justify a clever and playful use of three- dimensionality, by creating a sort of underworld made of different forms and colors, a world where toys come to life when the owner is absent. This choice is a strike of genius because it provides an escapist value in our own environment, Disney provided enough movies set in forests, mountains, jungles, and for its first 3D film, we have the first in-door Disney film, which gives an irresistible feeling of intimacy.This simplicity is the perfect counterpart to the complexity of special effects and the creativity of the screenplay because it also succeeds to add a little touch of nostalgia and hit a sensitive chord by waking the inner child inside of us. In 1995, we're in the middle of Disney Renaissance and its streak of successful films was so full of adventures and romance, thrills and laughs that Toy Story almost resonates as a comeback to the roots of the Walt Disney Company, childhood. Haven't we all played with toys when we were kids, whether they were dolls, Smurfs figurines, cars, monsters, haven't we all used our hands, totally invisible for our little eyes, and talked instead of characters, like magical puppeteers, imagining them sliding from a ravine that was our bathtub, or escalating a vertical mount, the bed-pillow. Toys were always alive for us, because our games were precisely what brought them to life, and in Toy Story, we always have the feeling that the creators are less 'making a film' than playing with toys like we used to do, engaging a tacit complicity with the kids in the audience, and the inner kids within the adults from the audience.Toy Story assumes that toys are alive, and the script is so well written that we're immediately convinced. There's no way Woody, the cowboy doll with Tom Hanks' voice couldn't be alive, that the cocky Buzz Lightyear is only a 3D talking image, that Mr. Potato Head isn't that grouchy figurine or that the Tyrannosaurus isn't that cute and somewhat coward creature, all the toys that belong to little Andy incarnate Disney's magical power, bringing things to life, and we realize how we all had a Disney inside us when we were playing with our toys. And Toy Story couldn't have a worthier villain a kid who destroyed toys, Sid a character I despised so much because I was definitely not a Sid when I was younger. Toy Story is an odyssey in the world of toys after which we don't see them the same way, calling them objects is almost insulting. Indeed, I've always felt guilty because as a teen, my mother told me to get rid of my toys, to give them to needier boys, and although I didn't play with them anymore, I remember how painful it was to say them goodbye, after Toy Story, now I feel better with myself.And Toy Story doesn't just takes its creativity and the cuteness of its characters for granted, there are the lines, the humor, but the story is here too, starting with the antagonism between the two 'lead' toys. Woody is jealous because Buzz, Andy's new birthday gift, became his best friend, in other words, his favorite toy, while Buzz doesn't know he's only a toy and lives in total denial about his true nature, which adds an unexpected bit of poignancy to characters that are not just three-dimension on a geometrical level. The film has its share of actions, mostly relying on the Buzz and Woody's duo trying to get back to Andy's house before the family moves in, but the emotional core of the film is their friendship. And progressively, their journey will allow them to understand the value of a toy, illustrated by Newman's Oscar-nominated song You've Got a Friend in Me; there would still be room for Woody in Andy's heart and there's an inner nobility in toys in the way they bring happiness during our most treasured memories.'Toy Story is a beautiful friendship story between two lovable toys, (have you noticed that Buzz and Woody makes buddy if you associate them), whose friendship culminate at the moment where both 'fall with style' in Andy's box. And I guess this is why we hardly remember how groundbreaking Toy Story was, maybe we just forgot about the special effects and the whole 3D thing, and simply remember the beauty of the story.

","genre":"Animation, Adventure, Comedy"},{"date":"11 January 2012","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Almost 20 years have passed since the nineties &#x85; Now, we are so familiar with the cell- phones, Facebook and the Internet that we're totally amnesic regarding these years where we had none, and we all scratch our heads wondering how communication was even possible back then. Not too surprisingly, the same reasoning can be applied for animation we're so used to CGI and 3D animated films that we forgot how groundbreaking Walt Disney's Toy Story was in 1995, and that we witnessed an event as historical as the release of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. It's not surprising by the way, that the two films are the only animated features included in the American Film Institute's Top 100 List.The comparison with Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs doesn't only rely on the technical achievement and the critical recognition, but also on what drove these two crucial aspects an endearing and universally appealing story. Snow White exploited all the comical possibilities of the dwarfs, in order to use physically distinct characters with different personalities attributed to each of them, while the Queen and Snow White could be modeled in more realistic designs; the setting also allowed the drawers to extend their talents and give it the touch of magic and exoticness the audiences needed back then. Toy Story does the exact same thing, it chooses the best setting that can justify a clever and playful use of three- dimensionality, by creating a sort of underworld made of different forms and colors, a world where toys come to life when the owner is absent. This choice is a strike of genius because it provides an escapist value in our own environment, Disney provided enough movies set in forests, mountains, jungles, and for its first 3D film, we have the first in-door Disney film, which gives an irresistible feeling of intimacy.This simplicity is the perfect counterpart to the complexity of special effects and the creativity of the screenplay because it also succeeds to add a little touch of nostalgia and hit a sensitive chord by waking the inner child inside of us. In 1995, we're in the middle of Disney Renaissance and its streak of successful films was so full of adventures and romance, thrills and laughs that Toy Story almost resonates as a comeback to the roots of the Walt Disney Company, childhood. Haven't we all played with toys when we were kids, whether they were dolls, Smurfs figurines, cars, monsters, haven't we all used our hands, totally invisible for our little eyes, and talked instead of characters, like magical puppeteers, imagining them sliding from a ravine that was our bathtub, or escalating a vertical mount, the bed-pillow. Toys were always alive for us, because our games were precisely what brought them to life, and in Toy Story, we always have the feeling that the creators are less 'making a film' than playing with toys like we used to do, engaging a tacit complicity with the kids in the audience, and the inner kids within the adults from the audience.Toy Story assumes that toys are alive, and the script is so well written that we're immediately convinced. There's no way Woody, the cowboy doll with Tom Hanks' voice couldn't be alive, that the cocky Buzz Lightyear is only a 3D talking image, that Mr. Potato Head isn't that grouchy figurine or that the Tyrannosaurus isn't that cute and somewhat coward creature, all the toys that belong to little Andy incarnate Disney's magical power, bringing things to life, and we realize how we all had a Disney inside us when we were playing with our toys. And Toy Story couldn't have a worthier villain a kid who destroyed toys, Sid a character I despised so much because I was definitely not a Sid when I was younger. Toy Story is an odyssey in the world of toys after which we don't see them the same way, calling them objects is almost insulting. Indeed, I've always felt guilty because as a teen, my mother told me to get rid of my toys, to give them to needier boys, and although I didn't play with them anymore, I remember how painful it was to say them goodbye, after Toy Story, now I feel better with myself.And Toy Story doesn't just takes its creativity and the cuteness of its characters for granted, there are the lines, the humor, but the story is here too, starting with the antagonism between the two 'lead' toys. Woody is jealous because Buzz, Andy's new birthday gift, became his best friend, in other words, his favorite toy, while Buzz doesn't know he's only a toy and lives in total denial about his true nature, which adds an unexpected bit of poignancy to characters that are not just three-dimension on a geometrical level.

When re-watching, every year since, sometimes multiple times, I always find my position in life determines how I view the movie. It is always a great movie, based on one of the better philosophy books written in the modern day (yes, Fight Club is a philosophy book, no arguments), but sometimes I view the characters with differing amounts of sympathy. Sometimes I wish I could join Project Mayhem, sometimes I am so glad I can't. But through and through this movie is anti-consumer, and it examines the way we have muddled ourselves into these collections of corporate brands as personalities, and it has never been done in a better way, before or since.I had never had the revelation that capitalism was evil and that actions are usually motivated by a want rather a need, until I saw this movie, and even at 13, I realized how gravely applicable this message was to our culture.This is, still, one of the best movies around.

Three guesses which one. Anyway, I figured this was as good a time as any to give this a review.Beauty and the Beast is a tale of a beautiful woman who meets a horrible beast and changes his attitude for the better. Simple, but Disney takes this tale to new heights. First of all, Belle(the beauty) is a very pretty young woman but is seen as an outcast in her village because she doesn't put out like the other girls and rather prefers to spend her time reading books. The most popular man in the village, Gaston, wants to marry Belle because he considers himself the most beautiful creature to ever enter the Earth and Belle to be as beautiful as him. But Belle can't stand him and keeps refusing his attempts at courtship.The plot really kicks off when Belle's eccentric father, Maurice, travels to a fair to show off his new invention. He get's lost along the way and is chased by a pack of wolves to a mysterious castle. There he finds that the household objects are all enchanted. There's Cogsworth(a clock), Lumiere(a candlestick), Mrs. Potts(A teapot) you get the gist. The master of the castle however, is a beast with a serious attitude problem. He locks Maurice in his dungeon and a few days later Belle finds the castle while looking for him. Belle opts to take Maurice's place as Beast's prisoner.What follows is the typical romance formula of two people who can't stand each other at first but slowly come to care and love for one another. Only this is one of those times where it's done perfectly. First of all they don't start really building a relationship until Belle chews Beast out on his temper and Beast saves Belle from a pack of wolves when she tries to leave. You start to see Beast's attitude really change for the better. He starts wearing better clothes, his voice becomes softer even his animation seems a little lighter. Near the end of the film Belle leaves to attend her sick father and Gaston finds out about the Beast and Belle's feelings toward him. He leads an assault on his castle which leads to an entertaining climax with the enchanted objects and a pretty intense fight between Beast and Gaston. This movie is great. The animation is great, the characters are well written, everything is great. And I don't think I have to mention the songs. I'm sure we're all familiar with Be Our Guest or Beauty and the Beast and they're great every time I hear them. Much like Lion King the only bad thing about the movie comes from an edit in the special edition. Human Again was designed for the original release but was cut probably for time purposes. It saw the light of day on Broadway and was added to the ten year anniversary edition in 2002. Well it's not a terrible song but it does interrupt the flow of the film.I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone of all ages. I'll probably go see it when it hits the big screen and I suggest you do the same.
