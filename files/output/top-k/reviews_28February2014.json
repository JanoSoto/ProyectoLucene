One of the biggest reasons behind this is when I started watching all these films that are generally considered classics, nearly every single one of them are nothing short of brilliant. There is almost always a reason why these films are timeless classics. I've been keeping Marathon Man on the back burner for awhile but I was pretty excited to see it. I love Dustin Hoffman and I was looking forward to seeing this. I have to admit that it sort of let me down. The movie, in my opinion, is okay at best. I know it was a big hit in 1976 and even had a lot of controversy around it because of the violence and content but I didn't feel like it held up very well years later. There is a lot of talent in the film but I felt like the characters and story were a little disjointed. It didn't flow very well and I found it hard to follow because nothing really stood out or came together very easily. I was amazed to find out how well respected this movie is and how much of it is considered iconic though I have never heard of the characters or the lines considered thus. To me the writing felt sloppy and it just misses the effectiveness that should have been there from a thriller like this.Dustin Hoffman is a legend and he has had too many great roles to count. I found his character almost drab in this. He seemed out of place (and I know to some extent that was the point) but I didn't find myself invested enough in his character. His chaotic and spiral into fear didn't capture me in the right way. I do understand why some would consider Laurence Olivier so brilliant in this. He is absolutely a twisted and blood thirsty villain who has some truly great scenes especially towards the end of the film. He definitely gives the best performance and considering the man was ravaged with cancer during this performance you have to give him props for an intense and villainous role. He takes an otherwise dreary script and makes it his own. The lack of chemistry though between Hoffman and Olivier was what made parts of the film seem so dull. Roy Scheider has a mostly small, effective role that he doesn't really get to do much with but he has enough charisma on screen to make his performance noticeable. Marthe Keller is decent but painfully predictable in her role as Hoffman's love interest. The moment she appeared on screen I had her entire character figured out because they made it so blatantly obvious. William Devane also has a very small role that is almost pointless and could have been played by any person.There are definitely a few intense, violent scenes that come out of nowhere adding to the shock value but it does nothing to make the story any more effective. I suppose if I had seen the film back in '76 it would have been less predictable, obvious and bland to me but this genre has been done before and done better since. This is the first film I have seen of John Schlesinger's but really his claim to fame is this and Midnight Cowboy. If you look at his film bio, he has had a string of movies that no one has ever heard of. I think perhaps he got lucky with those two films and that his talent isn't as great as his luck is. The directing and the writing feels clumsy and there are certain scenes where I could feel the tension and see the possibility of a truly great moment but the directing is foolish and leaves it in the dust. The closing scene of this film is probably the most effective but to me that scene in the water treatment plant could have been EPIC...and instead it was missing something. Again, Olivier commands the scene completely and Hoffman seems awkwardly out of place and almost bored. I very much wanted to like Marathon Man but it didn't hit the right notes for me. The reason to watch this film is Olivier without a doubt and the rest is lacklustre at best. 6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"28 February 2014","score":"","review":" In the last few years I have become an avid fan of classic film.

Well, there is some sort of plot about some Western gunslingers and the sheriff who chases them. But really the only reason the movie exists is to show off Russell's cleavage. She certainly looks great and director Howard Hughes is more than happy to let the camera linger on her fine female form. But breasts can only take a movie so far. It's not worth sitting through 2 hours of absolute dreck to sneak a few peeks of a babe in a low-cut blouse.The story in this movie never grabs your interest, it's a dull movie pretty much beginning to end. Matters are not helped by some truly wretched acting. Jack Buetel, playing famed outlaw Billy the Kid, is just terrible. He's stiff, unnatural and has all the personality of a block of wood. Meanwhile Russell has little to offer besides her ample bosom. She may have gone on to a respectable acting career but here, in the movie which made her a star, it is safe to say she had not yet honed her craft. The movie relies on there being some kind of spark between Russell's character, Rio, and Billy the Kid. Sadly two rather inept performances mean there is no spark at all. That relationship falls flat, the whole movie follows suit. Reliable Hollywood veterans Walter Huston, playing Doc Holliday, and Thomas Mitchell who plays Sheriff Pat Garrett come off better than Buetel and Russell. But even they can't really make much of what is a rather lousy script. The movie takes real-life characters and tosses them into a completely made-up story. You'd think if you were going to make up a story you would at least make up an interesting one. No such luck. The movie is a real snoozer. Anytime there threatens to be even a little bit of heat between Rio and Billy censorship standards of the 1940s dictate an awkward cut away before we actually see anything. The story and the acting are laughable throughout which means the absurdly cartoonish score fits right in. Hard to take anything seriously with that absurd music blaring the whole time. It all leads up to a conclusion which is just impossibly bad, by this point you're definitely laughing at the movie, not with it. Howard Hughes fought so hard to be able to show the world Jane Russell's breasts. Unfortunately those breasts did not have a movie to support them.

This film was one of the first live action films from Disney that I've seen, and I had a blast with it because Disney tackled one of my specialties which is sci-fi. This is a unique gem because this came out at a time when Disney decided to take chances to reach out to a wider audience, and personally I felt they were on the right track despite not good with keeping on it.I like the story, yeah it's an absurd plot but at least it's a simple uncomplicated one. The plot could of been anything else or gone any other way if you've ever read the history on the writing of the movie. In a way it's sort of the creepy\/haunted mansion scenario but in space. This film is more pulp sci-fi, it's not really concerned with logic, it's just being what it should be plain fun.Characters are good\/decent they all serve their functions and are played by a good cast. Maximillian Schell as Dr. Hans Reinhardt I thought was a solid villain, he's the typical mad scientist you can tell physically from his messy hair but also just simply the feeling this guy hasn't gotten out much, just way too much time alone. Underrated actor Robert Foster I though was solid as Capt. Dan Holland, he's the typical daring protagonist but he's got a little charisma which is why I like him. Even his friend Lt.Charles Fizer (Joseph Bottoms) whom is the typical hotshot.However the characters that stand out the most for me are the robots. From the two cute robots, the up to date one Vincent, voiced well by t Roddy McDowall and the robot that seen better days Bob voiced by Slim Pickens. I like the designs of them small, unique look almost like hovering trash cans not that that's a bad thing, but I really like the eyes of both of them which are friendly.I really like the back and forth between them it's pretty much the classic collaboration between both old and young, how both have the best in values. Both have charisma I like how Vincent sounds sophisticated and proper when Bob sounds like an old cowboy which feels right considering the model types both are. Even feel sad when something happens to one of them.I like the antagonist Maxamilian, sure he doesn't say anything but he's an antagonist about presence. I really like the design of him, from the crimson red color, height, glowing red visor, just brings out intimidation and says unfriendly. Though to me what really made me nervous as a kid was the fact that he was hard to kill and was armed with those propeller blades that could cut anything.The first half is a bit of a slow burn but I really like it because it's a suspenseful mystery. Your in the characters shoes as their all trying to orient themselves with the enviorment their in and the many questions they have like, what happened to the rest of the crew, why such a high population of robots? You can probably easily guess the answer to these questions but it's really the matter of building up to the final result that keeps us on our toes.However what really made the film stand out was in both it's production value and the music. The production value I really felt was on par, they had a big budget which I felt they used well. I really like the design of the robots from the ones I've mentioned to the flunkies. But what impressed me more is the design of the starship which I think is great, it looks like a world of it's own; from the vastness to the multiple rooms it had like a biosphere, a shooting gallery room, just anything. But also the amount of darkness in the ship which give it a dark and foreboding atmosphere.Even the visual effects when the characters go into the Black Hole. Some have complained about this sequence, but even that could of gone either way once again it's in the history. Also lets face it do we really know what's in a black hole. Personally I thought it was a beautiful and trippy ride, though I'll let you be the judge of that once you get to the sequence.The action sequences are decent, from most of the shootouts but one sequence I really liked was the one on one between Maxamilan and Vincent, it was pretty much a David and Golith battle, you could easily guess who wins if you remember that story.And the music I think is superb it's one of my personal favorite movie scores that I feel is underrated. I really love the theme song which has that sense of mystery and almost sense of dread. There was also a remix of the theme by MECO which I think is great because it's a more adventurous tune. Overall, it a fun film, it's not one of best Sci-Fi's in my book but like any interstellar expedition it's worth a trip.Rating 3 stars ","genre":null},{"date":"28 February 2014","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" This is another under the radar gem and another relic from my childhood.

This film is more pulp sci-fi, it's not really concerned with logic, it's just being what it should be plain fun.Characters are good\/decent they all serve their functions and are played by a good cast. Maximillian Schell as Dr. Hans Reinhardt I thought was a solid villain, he's the typical mad scientist you can tell physically from his messy hair but also just simply the feeling this guy hasn't gotten out much, just way too much time alone. Underrated actor Robert Foster I though was solid as Capt. Dan Holland, he's the typical daring protagonist but he's got a little charisma which is why I like him. Even his friend Lt.Charles Fizer (Joseph Bottoms) whom is the typical hotshot.However the characters that stand out the most for me are the robots. From the two cute robots, the up to date one Vincent, voiced well by t Roddy McDowall and the robot that seen better days Bob voiced by Slim Pickens. I like the designs of them small, unique look almost like hovering trash cans not that that's a bad thing, but I really like the eyes of both of them which are friendly.I really like the back and forth between them it's pretty much the classic collaboration between both old and young, how both have the best in values. Both have charisma I like how Vincent sounds sophisticated and proper when Bob sounds like an old cowboy which feels right considering the model types both are. Even feel sad when something happens to one of them.I like the antagonist Maxamilian, sure he doesn't say anything but he's an antagonist about presence. I really like the design of him, from the crimson red color, height, glowing red visor, just brings out intimidation and says unfriendly. Though to me what really made me nervous as a kid was the fact that he was hard to kill and was armed with those propeller blades that could cut anything.The first half is a bit of a slow burn but I really like it because it's a suspenseful mystery. Your in the characters shoes as their all trying to orient themselves with the enviorment their in and the many questions they have like, what happened to the rest of the crew, why such a high population of robots? You can probably easily guess the answer to these questions but it's really the matter of building up to the final result that keeps us on our toes.However what really made the film stand out was in both it's production value and the music. The production value I really felt was on par, they had a big budget which I felt they used well. I really like the design of the robots from the ones I've mentioned to the flunkies. But what impressed me more is the design of the starship which I think is great, it looks like a world of it's own; from the vastness to the multiple rooms it had like a biosphere, a shooting gallery room, just anything. But also the amount of darkness in the ship which give it a dark and foreboding atmosphere.Even the visual effects when the characters go into the Black Hole. Some have complained about this sequence, but even that could of gone either way once again it's in the history. Also lets face it do we really know what's in a black hole. Personally I thought it was a beautiful and trippy ride, though I'll let you be the judge of that once you get to the sequence.The action sequences are decent, from most of the shootouts but one sequence I really liked was the one on one between Maxamilan and Vincent, it was pretty much a David and Golith battle, you could easily guess who wins if you remember that story.And the music I think is superb it's one of my personal favorite movie scores that I feel is underrated. I really love the theme song which has that sense of mystery and almost sense of dread. There was also a remix of the theme by MECO which I think is great because it's a more adventurous tune. Overall, it a fun film, it's not one of best Sci-Fi's in my book but like any interstellar expedition it's worth a trip.Rating 3 stars ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Family"},{"date":"28 February 2014","score":"","review":" I have never watched such a wonderful and nicely plotted movie.
