This is where the struggle occurs for this film. It is an internal struggle because of the popularity of Metropolitan you want to enjoy this film, feel that brush of fresh air, and laugh at what others would consider intelligent banter, but even with the subtle humor between Eigeman and Nichols there is something missing that connects the crucial plot elements together. Stillman has created another valuable film, but it feels more like he was trying to reproduce the excitement of Metropolitan than create a new voice.One cannot argue that Wit Stillman's style of film-making is still seen throughout modern cinema culture. While watching Barcelona, there was this eerie feeling of watching The Darjeeling Limited again. Stillman's voice can be found in nearly all Wes Anderson films, the witty conversation, the intellectual characters, and the thin layer of plot are Stillman's characteristics seen today. Take Margo at the Wedding, Baumback uses Stillman with honor and respect, and can even been better seen in Baumback's early Kicking and Screaming. The key difference between these modern directors and Stillman's Barcelona is that they develop both plot and characters. Stillman's visual technique, his ability to capture the sense of normality, and control of the language is powerful in this film, but an apathetic feel for Ted and Fred, coupled with a lack of focus &#150; pushed Barcelona from challenging second film to average sophomoric effort. From a sales perspective, Ted and Fred couldn't persuade me to do anything, much less follow them around. Their jovial voice and constant bickering would amuse at first, but like the film became annoying near the end. From a character standpoint, Ted (Taylor Nichols) was enjoyable to watch. He felt like the stuck-in-sales type of guy that others could relate to. Aside from the religious dance scene (continuing with the unfocused plot idea), he was the quintessential hero of this film. Fred (Christopher Eigeman) covers the other end of the spectrum entirely. There was no belief that he was a Navy officer, his constant lying and possible theft (again &#150; that kayaking scene that lead ultimately nowhere) just created an annoying character that tried to be funny, but never was. There was this sense that Eigeman didn't understand he and Nichols' character relationship. One needs to ask, was Nichols' stutter part of the character, or just Stillman's lack of editing? Finally, what was Mira Sorvino doing here? Her accent was thicker than pea soup, yet as unbelievable as pea soup finding its way into a Whit Stillman film.The obscurity of the actors leading us through this political comedy\/drama, was a tough nail to bite, but the tougher one was the overall plot of this film. Stillman's goal was to make humor out of an odd anti-American culture in Spain. His actors, as mentioned, tried to bring the humor, but it was up to Stillman to bring us the connectors and overall themes of Barcelona. It is this area that I felt Stillman was at his weakest. While the actors were not quite the caliber of Stillman's original effort, they at least made me chuckle and think of Wes Anderson's films, but I felt forced and confused by where Stillman was headed with the camera. The bomb at the beginning seemed pass√©, the anti-Americanism comments seemed less real &#150; Stillman never quite secured the feel of realism with this film. Our two characters walk down the street, talk-back to those who oppose them, and show less emotion when the dramatic ending takes place &#150; there just wasn't that sense of fear. This felt insulting. Stillman's eye in this film felt bored, stale, and unenergetic. This needs to be a stand alone film for Stillman, but I found myself comparing it to Metropolitan constantly. This film was missing that freshness, or that sense of excitement, and that desire to see the unknown. The relationships were bland, the characters were humorous &#150; but un-follow-able, and the story itself felt forced. This wasn't Stillman's greatest outing. He made some choices that didn't translate well onto the bigger screen. The colors even tired my eyes &#150; it just wasn't the film I expected, or wanted, from Stillman.Overall, Barcelona was a second outing for Whit Stillman, but it wasn't the caliber of Metropolitan. This film felt old, used, and un-welcomed in Stillman's repertoire of characters and language. There was plenty of potential, but it went unused with people like Mira Sorvino attempting to capture the essence of a Spanish woman. Again, I want to state that this film had some very funny moments that were as dry as any martini one could hope for. It had my laughing, but it wasn't enough. I wanted a detailed story, I wanted some of the issues about being a salesman come out clearer, and I wanted that random scene of religion and dancing to carry more gumption. Barcelona felt as if Stillman would start ideas, but never quite complete them. This film reminded me of Kevin Smith's early work. Using the same actors, Smith would attempt to recreate the same characters in different environments with mixed results. The power and honesty of Smith's Clerks could never be recreated and thus the doomed Clerks II will never reach cult status. That analogy could be used for Stillman's Barcelona. He tried, but there is a reason this film wasn't nominated for the best screenplay category &#150; it just felt elusive and incomplete.Grade *** (hesitantly) out of ***** ","genre":null},{"date":"27 April 2008","score":"","review":" Barcelona is a bizarre film that captures your attention through the fast-paced repertoire, but looses you through unfocused political jargon that doesn't seem important, but is obviously an instrumental part of the film.

Soon Johnny will realize that he can see the past, the present or the future of the people that makes physical contact with him.This is the main plot of The Dead Zone, based upon a novel by Stephen King, as usual. The film begins with a little introduction of how the life of Johnny was and soon after that we have the impressive car accident that leaves him in coma. I love how since the accident, the film focuses in Johnny's mind making a really interesting study of this character and not just the usual sci-fi story with a character that has an unusual ability that uses it for being good or bad. First we see how Johnny face the situation that his girl is now married and how, after he discovers his new ability, he feel the pressure of the press feeling that his ability is a curse. When he feels that he can make a good friendship with Sarah he decide to use the ability for helping other persons, in this case for finding a murderer and although they find the murderer, Johnny have the sensation that he could stop him before he committed the murders. So again he feels that the people are abusing of him and he decide to return to his work as a teacher. The last part of the film is just the best with this little kid who is the proof that Johnny can change the way of the things and also with the political factor with Greg Stillson (Martin Sheen) that ends in a great way, specially the very end that is full of suspense and with a great and fair conclusion.Well, I recently re-watched Videodrome and now this film and both were released in 1983 so for me David Cronenberg was just really inspired and although both films have similar things, in the end both are quite different from each other being this film much more accessible. In fact this film is the most accessible film that I have seen in the entire career of Cronenberg.Anyway, Christopher Walken is really young here and really great just as Martin Sheen who also looks really young.

I haven't read the novel; I think I haven't read complete any book of King but I do have seen many films based in his work and definitely this is one of my favourites. 9.5 out of 10PS is funny and strange to see Walken talking about The Legend of Sleepy Hollow a couple of times in the film.

There's an intimacy to it, he brings us close to the characters. Also the way he uses the angles and straight lines of the windows, doors and buildings to frame his shots impresses us immediately with the dehumanizing nature of the city much as it did in his Oscar Winning American film Sunrise A Song of Two Humans. As if the impressive direction and photography weren't enough to distinguish this as one of the most impressive films I've seen from the early 20s, the whole affair is anchored by a brilliant performance from Emil Jannings. He plays a man who is retired from his position as a hotel doorman and demoted to the washroom, which leads to a sort of nervous breakdown imaginatively filmed and a fetishistic attachment to the uniform of his former office.This isn't a plot heavy film or a drama heavy film, basically it's a character study. It's remarkable for the fact that there are no dialog title cards, and only 2 or 3 informational title cards relating to various events and anchored to specific informational devices interior to the film (e.g. we see the boss' letter telling him of his demotion). The quality of the acting not only from Jannings but from the entire cast (perhaps with the exception of a broadly played gossip woman) we see very natural performances that you often don't in silent films.Of the 3 films I've seen by Murnau, this film impressed me the most. It doesn't have the melodramatic elements that make Sunrise a bit more predictable, and it doesn't have the languid pace that slows Nosferatu for me. It reminds me in some ways of the films I've seen from the 30s by Jean Renoir -- there's this fantastic way that the camera follow the actors around on the streets, pulling ahead of them momentarily and then allowing the main actor to zip through the frame while it focuses on incidental details. I'm thinking specifically of the scene where Jannings escapes after stealing back the uniform, but there are several scenes along these lines.Essentially I saw this film as a message of hope, interestingly couched with an explanation from the film-makers that in reality it would not have ended happily. It's too easy to see this card, one of as I said only 2 or 3 in the entire film and the only one that's not tied to a specific device, as Murnau's way of eating his cake and having it too. Is there a touch of the ending from this movie, with the two former bums riding off together, that comes to mind when you see Wilder's Some Like It Hot? Or has this been filtered by way of Mssrs. Lubitsch and Renoir et al? Either way I would describe the movie overall as purely cinematic, miles and miles beyond normal film-making techniques and taste of the early 20s and even arguably of today.

It's too easy to see this card, one of as I said only 2 or 3 in the entire film and the only one that's not tied to a specific device, as Murnau's way of eating his cake and having it too. Is there a touch of the ending from this movie, with the two former bums riding off together, that comes to mind when you see Wilder's Some Like It Hot? Or has this been filtered by way of Mssrs. Lubitsch and Renoir et al?

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"27 April 2008","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" From the very first shots of this movie, my friend and I were just in awe of the way Murnau uses the camera to set up his situation. There's an intimacy to it, he brings us close to the characters. Also the way he uses the angles and straight lines of the windows, doors and buildings to frame his shots impresses us immediately with the dehumanizing nature of the city much as it did in his Oscar Winning American film Sunrise A Song of Two Humans. As if the impressive direction and photography weren't enough to distinguish this as one of the most impressive films I've seen from the early 20s, the whole affair is anchored by a brilliant performance from Emil Jannings. He plays a man who is retired from his position as a hotel doorman and demoted to the washroom, which leads to a sort of nervous breakdown imaginatively filmed and a fetishistic attachment to the uniform of his former office.This isn't a plot heavy film or a drama heavy film, basically it's a character study. It's remarkable for the fact that there are no dialog title cards, and only 2 or 3 informational title cards relating to various events and anchored to specific informational devices interior to the film (e.g. we see the boss' letter telling him of his demotion). The quality of the acting not only from Jannings but from the entire cast (perhaps with the exception of a broadly played gossip woman) we see very natural performances that you often don't in silent films.Of the 3 films I've seen by Murnau, this film impressed me the most. It doesn't have the melodramatic elements that make Sunrise a bit more predictable, and it doesn't have the languid pace that slows Nosferatu for me.

The Natural is one of the best kinds of sports movies. It is a film that LOVES the game it is depicting. Sports movies often try but fail to convey their true appreciation for the game they are about. Other times, sports movies are simply parodies of the worst traits of their games. The Natural elevates its story and characters to mythical proportions. The results are generally moving.Robert Redford is the title character named Roy Hobbs. When we first meet him as a young man, he is all set to become perhaps the greatest pitcher of all time. An unfortunate tragedy robs Hobbs of the next 16 years of his career, and the next time we see him, he is an aging rookie just trying to play right field for the worst team in major league baseball known as the New York Knights. The Knights are quite a bunch of guys. Managed by a grizzled old coach (Brimley), they seem destined to be cellar dwellers until Hobbs is finally given the chance to play and his incredible hitting ability inspires all of them to play like champions. The owner of the team, a crusty old judge, will win full control of the team from Brimiley if they don't win the pennant. He and his cronies attempt to use money and beautiful women to trip Hobbs up, and his character is tested once again as an older man. Will he remain true to the game? Will the wounds from his previous accident prevent him from winning the big game? Apparently not. But I guess in the book, he strikes out in his final at bat. Come on! Robert Redford's ego is way too big to have allowed that ending to be filmed!!! The film scores its most points (or runs) in terms of its nostalgic feeling. You really come away believing that's how things looked for a baseball team in the 1930s. The acting ranges from exceptional to mediocre, to maybe just sub-par. Many of the supporting cast out-shine Redford in little scenes. The man just doesn't have the acting chops to justify his stardom. At least in this film, he isn't smug like he is in so many other films. Roy Hobbs is generally a humble and unassuming character that you feel compelled to root for. Even when he makes a bad decision. Support from Farnsworth, McGavin, and Duvall is outstanding. Kim Basinger might have been a little out of her element, however. But she is nice to look at.Although the film is loaded with mythology and symbolism, the basic lesson learned is pretty much Don't rely on your gifts alone. You have to work hard and make good choices in life, or all manner of things can bring you down. Redford also gets major props for developing a great-looking swing.

Feivel is adorable, and I can see why people would be attracted to watch a movie with such a cute little protagonist. Tiger, voiced by Dom Deluise, is a pretty interesting character, as a vegetarian cat who'd rather befriend mice, than eat them. But the odd thing in the relationship between Feivel and Tiger is, why this grown cat is now great friends with this tiny little kid mouse, and how fast they become best friends. It was just a relationship that should've spanned more time to make more sense.The animation is not great. It's really loose, and characters shapes change depending on the scene. Sometimes characters are enormously fat, next scene they could be just slightly fat, next scene they could have a huge head. The animation over emphasizes what the point of focus on the character is in a certain scene. For instance, One scene, a cat is supposed to look ferocious, it has a huge mouth with sharp teeth, next scene it's supposed to look nice, so it's stomach is out, because we all know fat cats are innocent.It may sound as though I hated this movie, but I actually, sort of like it.

Tiger, voiced by Dom Deluise, is a pretty interesting character, as a vegetarian cat who'd rather befriend mice, than eat them. But the odd thing in the relationship between Feivel and Tiger is, why this grown cat is now great friends with this tiny little kid mouse, and how fast they become best friends. It was just a relationship that should've spanned more time to make more sense.The animation is not great. It's really loose, and characters shapes change depending on the scene. Sometimes characters are enormously fat, next scene they could be just slightly fat, next scene they could have a huge head. The animation over emphasizes what the point of focus on the character is in a certain scene. For instance, One scene, a cat is supposed to look ferocious, it has a huge mouth with sharp teeth, next scene it's supposed to look nice, so it's stomach is out, because we all know fat cats are innocent.It may sound as though I hated this movie, but I actually, sort of like it. It's cute, but flawed in many ways, and by the end grows boring.

The Mouskewitz family decides to migrate from Russia to America after a particularly bad attack from cats. On the boat ride there, Feivel falls overboard and ends up being picked up by a pigeon, in New York.

Years ago, when I first saw this film in a reduced and very badly put together restoration from the 80s (with the Razzie-nominated Giorgio Moroder score!), I thought it was one of the worst silent pictures I had ever seen. Today (ironically in the then-distant 21st century when the film is supposed to be set) we at last have an adequate reconstruction, with a cleaned up negative, explanations of missing scenes and the original Gottfried Huppertz score, and we can see Metropolis for the masterpiece it is.The first thing that hits you when watching Metropolis is the powerful sense of rhythm, with an attention grabbing montage of industrial machinery. From here on the dynamic, kinetic flow of images is continuous &#150; creating an exciting and extreme form of visual storytelling comparable to the work Eisenstein and Abel Gance. In his previous few films you can see Lang trying to perfect the rhythm and structure of the whole and here he finally manages it. The drama is even structured and labelled like a work of classical music. The prelude establishes themes and characters and is full of impressive and grandiose imagery, yet never gets too frantic in pace. The intermezzo begins slowly before building up to the frenzy of the erotic dance\/nightmare sequence. Finally, the furioso section is a tour-de-force of non-stop action. Thanks to the Nibelungen films, Lang had learned by this point to direct crowds and action convincingly.The other strand in Lang's work that reached maturity with Metropolis was his architect's approach to shots and sets. He'd been using geometric patterns and massive interiors since the early 20s, but now you can tell he knows exactly what he's doing. One of the rules of cinema is the so-called line of action, which means you are supposed to keep the camera on one side only of two opposing actors, so that one is always screen-left and the other always screen-right. Lang completely ignores this rule, freely placing his camera at whichever angle he deems necessary. This technique would become harder for Lang when he moved to Hollywood, where sets were like rooms in a doll's house with three sides only. Here however, every set is a genuine space with four walls, and Lang shows these off to achieve a feeling of reality. This use of space is not just some aesthetic gimmick &#150; it is really used to enhance the film experience. Take for example the scene in which Rotwang captures Maria in the catacombs. Lang cannot exploit fear of the unknown because we, the audience, already know what is happening. Instead, he creates a real sense of enclosure and entrapment with his 360-degree coverage of the cave.The science-fiction setting of Metropolis makes acceptable the over-the-top visual effects of German expressionist cinema (such as double-exposures and animated titles) and, fortunately Lang knew where to draw the line on these flashy techniques. The unreality of the genre also allows for more stylised acting, and the Germans really were the masters of ham. Rudolph Klein-Rogge makes a typically crazed villain. Brigitte Helm also does a good job in several contrasting roles.So long as you can ignore the occasionally daft ideas of screenwriter Thea von Harbou, Metropolis in its current restored version is Fritz Lang's best film.

It begins with a woman who's sin was motherhood, who gives birth to a baby she can't support at a Charity Hospital which is kept pad-locked from the inside. She is forced to abandon it in an alley, and before long Chaplin wanders by and what follows is one of the best sequences of the film, as he is casually strolling by and then, through a series of odd but entirely believable situations, he is unable to get rid of it. It is no secret that little Jackie Coogan nearly stole the show from Chaplin (who was in top form) playing the little boy at 5 years old. Charlie's life is thrown into turmoil by the unexpected arrival of the baby, but eventually he sort of organizes his life and when the kid gets a little older they make a nice living together, the boy breaking windows and Charlie selling replacements. Soon the police notice so they have to cut and run, because there are other conflicts approaching which will warrant screen time much more than how they make money. It is interesting to watch the film oscillate back and forth from Chaplin's traditional slapstick comedy and a much more developed, dramatic story. The film is interspersed with pure slapstick and some genuinely moving moments (sometimes simultaneously, if you can believe that), but overall it is a truly heartwarming tale of friendship and family and survival, and it is never once predictable, all the way until the last frame.There is a quick scene where the kid gets into a fist fight with another little boy, and in between rounds,  Charlie is rubbing the kid down and congratulating him on fighting so well, and giving him hints for the rest of the fight. Meanwhile, the other kid's brother shows up, a massive oaf of a man who looks more like Frankenstein's monster than anything else. What follows is a pretty funny fight that looks startlingly similar to the fight between Charlie and the town bully in Easy Street. This is a slapstick set-up that is so simple that it could have been thrown in just to take up screen time, were it not for it's direct relevance to the story.At another point, there is pure slapstick taking place in their little shack of a home, as the 1921 version of Child Protective Services shows up to tear the young boy crying from Jackie's arms. I think this is the only time in any film that I've ever seen genuine, low-brow slapstick so seamlessly combined with a truly sad and heartbreaking incident. This combination, not just here but throughout the film, is The Kid's biggest achievement. There is a dream sequence near the end of the film that I am really not sure what to think about, although my understanding is that volumes have been written about it's symbolic meaning, both within the movie and in reference to Chaplin's personal life. And speaking of which, supposedly there were some legal issues involving money and divorce for which Chaplin sped the film stock to Utah for editing. I don't know which story to believe, that it was because of Chaplin's painful divorce or because he was unhappy with his salary (I would bet it's a little of both), but the film is here and I guess ultimately that's all that matters. In the five or six times that I've seen The Kid, I am always a little uncomfortable with that kiss that Charlie gives the kid when he finally rescues him from the back of that truck, if only because I am conscious that he is not the tramp's real son, either on screen or off. Then again, I am looking at it with 21st century eyes. Some of Shirley Temple's early films are also a little disturbing to me, although for not quite the same reasons. By this time, Chaplin was fully on the road to his career in full length feature films, and after 36 short comedies for Mack Sennett at Keystone Studios and a dozen or so more for Essanay and Vagabond (along with a few assorted others), Charlie was fast on the way to establishing himself as one of the greatest stars in the history of the cinema.

","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"27 April 2008","score":"10 out of 14 people found the following review useful","review":" A young ethnic kid from a rough area is up on a murder charge and to the jury of twelve men, it all seems a fairly open and shut case. So all are surprised when the votes come back with one not guilty in the pack. Juror #8 maintains he holds a reasonable doubt, much to the frustration of the rest of the group. The stalemate forces a debate over the details of the case which sees each man questioning others and themselves for their motivations and decisions. The heat in the room and the passage of time sees tensions rising by the minute.I'm not a massive fan of the Movie You Must See podcast crew because they mostly tend to discuss the events in a film rather than really critiquing or reviewing it (although at times this mates in a pub approach is OK). Anyway, one of the advantages of having anyone pointing out films you should see is that it reminds you that you should these films. So it was for me as I listened to 12 Angry Men and realised that not only had I never reviewed it but that I had not actually watched it for many years. Of course mentally I knew it was a classic but did I really understand why it was? So when it came on television recently I watched it again with new eyes.The films moves right into the jury room and pretty much this room is all we have for the duration. Initially the script does really well to have the viewer side with the majority because in the discussions the evidence does seem very clear cut and #8's doubts seem so general and non-specific. This is a good way to start because it means the viewer also has to question and we are taken along the journey just like the men in the jury. Gradually we get into the detail and doubts are tweaked out &#150; not to the point of solving the crime because that is not what it is about but it is done in a way that is interesting and engaging. It is not perfect in this regards though because some of the jumps are big, some of the assumptions are stretching and some of the knowledge in the room is a little too convenient. However what weaknesses there are in the material are covered by the fact that the delivery is roundly quite brilliant.Lumet directions from within the room and makes great use of such a small space. It feels like it could be a play (not sure if it was or not) but Lumet prevents this just feeling like filmed theatre. The camera captures the room, sticks close to characters, moves around, in and out accordingly and it never feels stiff. This aids the sense of tension from the audience point of view as we are not just left watching the room so much as being in it. The ensemble cast are another big factor in this delivery as they all deliver. On the surface of it the characters could easily be labelled racist, old, na√Øve, angry and so on but the actors don't let themselves be that basic and they also do a good job of pacing the building resentment and tension in the room to be convincing. Fonda maybe has top-billing but he does have the least showy role, leading those into his corner. Cobb and Begley have good turns as the anger of the room but everyone plays their parts very well. OK Balsam, Webber and Voskovec come out the least memorable of the lot but this is understandable when viewed beside such sterling turns from Fielder, Klugman, Warden, Sweeney and Marshall. There really isn't a weak link in the room.With modern cynical eyes it is perhaps totally hard to accept the film for its praise of the jury system and I do agree with the MYMS group when they made reference to the moment in HLOTS which is essentially the bitter reverse of this film. However this slightly flag-waving stuff is covered by the delivery being as strong and as well paced as it is.

Right.Okay...moving right along In Switzerland, an American playboy, Robert Marvin (a very young Robert Young) worms his way into the intrepid threesome from England, apparently intent upon stealing\/wooing\/seducing Elsa &#150; not sure which, actually.

Nick Cage has never been funnier -- after he's done so many bad movies, I sometimes try to figure out why I liked him in the first place and I always come back to this movie. Holly Hunter was perfect also, I love how she becomes the chief instigator of the caper and the way she grits her teeth and intones like Clint Eastwood I want that baby. Give me that baby.

Despite all the work to make it a darker effort than one might see, and more exotic with the Japanese locales, there's still the good-ol' American style to the story of I always get my man, and it's the main thing that keeps it into the conventional and even 'safe' territory. But where it strikes its best ground, and stays fresh outside of its 80's period (and at this point it's a period piece thanks to the drastic drop in crime in NYC, if not in how the yakuza works in Japan), is in its focus as a character study, as opposed to the action which is more or less to be expected (there's even a ritualistic beheading of a character, of whom I won't reveal).For Michael Douglas this was an attempt to deepened his persona as a star from what his two huge hits had been two years before (Wall Street and Fatal Attraction). Here he's not in a 'gray' area as a character, he's a fallen soul who curses like a sailor, is even more of a hard-ass than Harry Callahan, and will go to any length to get his man as it continues to go against the Japanese police force.

Cheng is somewhat effeminate and plays women in the performances, most notably the woman in the traditional opera Farewell My Concubine. Cheng is gay and in love with Duan who is classically masculine; Duan's feelings for Cheng do not go beyond friendship. Things between the two go along well until Juxian enters the picture as Duan's lover and subsequent wife. The story revolves around the complex emotional interplay between these three, played out against dramatic historical events. The history of China in the years covered would require a shelf full of books, but this movie concentrates on three eras The Warlord Era in the 1920s, the Japanese occupation of Beijing during WWII (and its aftermath), and the Cultural Revolution during the Mao era. The interweaving of the personal stories with the themes of the opera Farewell My Concubine, together with the historical events, is cleverly done. The telling of this epic runs to 171 minutes on the DVD. In keeping with its operatic theme this movie has an overture that sets the tone and piques your curiosity about what is to come. This sequence seemed artificial to me until I understood its intent.Most everyone will be impressed with the sumptuous color cinematography. The opera scenes are impressively filmed and, while I could appreciate the artistry involved, being primarily attuned to Western culture prevented my being captivated on an emotional level as I was, for example, by the operatic scenes in Amadeus. Cheng's singing sounded more like the harsh screeching of a cat than anything that would engage me. The atonal music and highly stylized acting in the operas were interesting as artistic phenomena of a foreign culture, but it would take significant exposure for me to ever truly enjoy such, if that were even possible.The extent to which this movie offers history lessons is not clear to me, nor is it clear how much is intended. During the 1920s the focus is on Cheng and Duan's training as young boys under the tutelage of a sadistic taskmaster. The child abuse is so graphic that some may be tempted to avert their eyes. Was the brutal treatment of the boys a symbol of the brutality of the era? I don't know. The political pressures of the Cultural Revolution must have been extreme in order to provoke the personal denunciations we see toward the end.One thing I found odd was that, while the characters must be at least sixty years old by the end, they look like they are still in their 30s.I admire this movie for its ambition and could appreciate it on an intellectual and artistic basis, but its epic sweep and cultural differences kept me at a distance.

I admired the credentials of the writer\/director and music director. I honestly think that this was a heartfelt, sincere effort to showcase one of America's cultural treasures.What went wrong? Not sure - but I think the writer-director was caught up in some sort of The Emperor's Clothes situation - no one willing to tell her she was over the top and off base - (catch her commentary with her husband\/music director - the poor guy cannot get a word in) Anyway...the movie.... shortly into it (3-5 minutes) I was coldly subjected to the oh-so phony bug eyed expression of the lead as she was passed over for a promotion. I actually hit rerun to view it again, because I thought I had missed a comment or something. Nope. no funny build-up. Just this Saturday Night Live over the top expression of shock. I kept watching, hoping that this was turning into a comedy of sorts.... The music pulled me in. But the acting had me rolling on the floor- along with the amateur plot and melodramatic editing. Every single character (and scenario) was a biased, overplayed stereotype. No exceptions. I do not know how these actors got through this without slitting their throats...Granny with her potions and road kill stew,the abandoned pregnant bleeding mother of a brood of barefoot hillbillies, and the esteemed doctor with her frustrated old maid- turned wanton wild mountain woman stuff (after having sex with the gruff bearded ex coal miner)- the joke complete with her running around in pantaloons and mussed up hair (and weird body language) (not to mention a plethora of bizarre bug eyed expressions)- did the director really ask this actress to keep popping out her eyes?PLEASE!
