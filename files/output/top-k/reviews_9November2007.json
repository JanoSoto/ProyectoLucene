The first time I watched it was about ten years ago. I was about 15 years old so I don't remember too much about it back then, but watching it now, and having it fresh in my mind, I have to say that this is one of the best action movies I've ever seen. The only reason to watch this movie is to see a lot of shooting and people dying. This movie was made in 1992 and it shows its age. The action sequences are not as polished as today's movies. The choreography is a little off, but that's how it was 15 years ago. John Woo is known for adding a lot of slow motion and flying doves in his movies and this movie is no exception. It adds a little drama to an action filled movie. This movie is not just another dumb action movie. Although it's filled with a lot of action scenes, the plot is above average. Chow Yun-Fat plays Inspector 'Tequila' Yuen, a cop who plays by his own rules to get the job done. The first scene is in a restaurant where a deal is going down and the cops and bad guys shoot up the place trying to kill each other. Yuen eventually runs down the last guy and kills him. When the dust settles, he finds out that the last guy he killed was actually an undercover cop. The next day, he finds a dead guy in a library, and it turns out that he was part of the Chinese triad. He finds another guy who is part of the triad and eventually finds out that he's also an undercover cop. They work together to stop the triad from smuggling weapons. The final scene takes place in a hospital where the triad and cops shoot and kill each other as well as innocent civilians. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes action movies. It might be old and the cinematography might be raw, but it is very enjoyable.

I just say this as a little warning, since I have the impression that lots of people are watching this just because of the reason that it always tops all kinds of different horror-lists. It still is a movie with unpleasant and oppressed undertones and yes, it's of course based on a Stephen King novel, so it's totally understandable that this movie is classified as an horror movie, but it's not the kind of horror you would expect. The movie is far from standard, which is perhaps the biggest reason why this movie works out as such an horror like one, but in totally original way of its own. The characters and situations are all unpredictable. You never know what to expect, which adds to the atmosphere of the movie.But the movie is also really powerful and effective as a drama. I remember when I first watched this movie I was still too young to be able to read the subtitles, so there was no way I could understand what the movie was about, but I could still totally feel for the main character and feel her fear for her mother and at school. It's of course also absolutely thanks to Sissy Spacek's great performance that this comes across so effectively. It makes you feel and sympathize for the main character, even though she is a really unusual person and extremely shy, insecure person. I think that everyone had a sort of Carrie like person in their class at high school (althouh I hope not as extreme as this one!), which also makes it easy to relate to the events and characters within the movie.I was also surprised at some of the light and fun elements within the movie. Apparently also some of the actors thought they were making a comedy during the production of this movie. Some parts of the movie really reminded me of some good old fashioned high-school comedies. But of course the comedy goes never at the expense of the movie its tension or dramatic elements. The comedy just makes sure that this movie isn't a complete dark one. The comedy is used to draw the people more into the movie and makes us feel more at ease, rather than pushing them away with only heavy distant drama and an uneasy atmosphere. I think Brian De Palma did a really good job at this! The best horror and tension also works out best when a movie makes you feel at ease first, rather than constantly trying to scare you, also with its atmosphere.Yes, the movie is also still a real Brian De Palma movie, so expect lots of unusual, artistic and often long shots. The movie has some typical De Palma moments in it, especially toward the ending during the prom. He also knows to build up the tension and a sequence in a way only he can. It's part of the reason why the ending is such a legendary one.The whole end-prom sequence is really an extremely memorable and brilliantly shot and constructed one, also once again thanks to its wonderful build-up of the inevitable events to come. It's one of the most extreme and totally straight-forward sequences, which makes sure that it will stay with you forever.For most part the movie also works out so great due to its acting. All of the student characters are very authentic and it helps that they are being played by not the greatest actors around. Let's face it, Amy Irving, Nancy Allen and William Katt never really became the famous respected actors everybody expected them to become in those days. Sissy Spacek really plays the role out of her career as Carrie White. You totally feel and sympathize for this girl. And Piper Laurie also plays a totally great and effective character, that perhaps is the most evil and scary one out of the entire movie, as the religious-freak and mother of Carrie. Also of course the early- and quite big movie role for John Travolta in this movie is already sort of a legendary one.It's truly an unique movie to watch. There never had been a movie like Carrie before and there almost most certainly won't be another one like it. Brian De Palma himself tried it a couple of years later with his movie The Fury but I think that experience made him realize how totally unique in its sort Carrie actually was and still is.10\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"9 November 2007","score":"3 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" The movie is often classified as an horror movie and it also is on basically every horror top-list published, but truth is that this movie isn't really an horror movie in terms of having all of the standard required horror elements.

The movie follows a writer (Jack Nicholson) and his family who agree to watch over a hotel while it is closed for the winter. There were rumours of the place being haunted and the last resident went crazy and murdered his family. But Jack is convinced it will be OK and he can use the quiet to overcome his writer's block. After months of solitude and silence however, Jack becomes a grumpy and later violent. Is it cabin fever or is there something in the hotel that is driving him mad? One of the creepiest parts about the movie is the feeling of isolation that Kubrick makes. The hotel is very silent, and the rooms are huge, yet always empty. It is also eerily calm when Jack's son is riding his bike through the barren hallways. Jack Nicholson's performance is also one of his very best, scaring the hell out of me and making me sure to get out once in awhile. My favourite scene is when he is talking to a ghost from inside a walk-in refrigerator.

It has stayed with me vividly and powerfully since I first saw it, and I continue to watch parts of it often.I don't know if Glen Berry or Scott Neal could have realized what an impact this film would have on some viewers, but I wish I could thank them for bringing such humanity, realism, and likability to the roles of Jamie and Ste.

If you're gay or just a human being with empathy and understanding (and a good sense of humor -- the script is terribly clever and the film really benefits from multiple viewings), Beautiful Thing is an experience you should not miss.

And the Tin Man shows no signs whatever of having no heart, except that his chest doesn't tick. They're charming without being particularly funny. But the Cowardly Lion is a different matter. He speaks for Everyman. Lahr is outrageously hammy. He has a working-class New York accent. He brags and threatens and he's a complete hypocrite, which the others definitely are not.

She's a small girl but she seems to sing from her abdomen. She's just about right, cute but not the sort of cute that rouses the pedophile in a normal man. She has high hips, rather shapeless limbs, and no neck to speak of. Later in life, strung out behind leapers and sleepers with a booze backer, she became an idol of the gay subculture. They loved her in her middle age. Every performance raised the question of whether she would finish the show or collapse on the stage.Another thing that strikes me. As in some other films, and speaking as a one-time day laborer who showed up in the line on Warren Street in New York, who does the work around here? In the Emerald City, everybody wears bright green costumes. Who presses them all? And then there's that horse of a different color. Who cleans up after that horse? The songs by Harold Arlen and Yip Harberg are just fine, and the incidental music was heavily influenced by Russian composers.

Actually there are many great scenes, but I choose to mention this one since it sets up the main course of action. The scene is relatively simple three worn out salesmen are told that they're fired and have one week to regain their respective positions, or they're fired for good. Simple, yes, but it is delivered with a scorching fierceness that makes Alec Baldwin's roughly six minute performance resonate throughout the entire film. But in doing so, it doesn't overshadow or diminish the rest of the performances which are great even by themselves. So in putting all these performances together into one film you truly have something that is greater than just the sum of its already good parts.The film seemingly draws from Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman, but it shows what Miller's play chose not too professional struggle. Meaning not at home, but at work. Not with wives and sons, but with co-workers and bosses. Basically the other side of the spectrum and it is no less interesting to see especially when it is delivered so well. Throughout the film the camera is relatively static, the characters in only a few different places all wearing the same plain clothes. But the subtleties and little gestures of each character flesh them out as to almost be palpable to someone watching. The use of profanity is also very good. Many film's use profane dialog as punchlines or simply since it is like violence in action films it sells. What Glengarry Glen Ross offers is not characters who talk, but character who convey emotion, and that is the essence of human speech - both in real life and in the movies.Scripter David Mamet also co-wrote (albeit under an alias) the screenplay for the action film Ronin from 1998. On the surface it's an action movie with great car chases, but the dialog there is reflective of Mamet's style that he demonstrates here.

Oh yeah, and the bitchin' cars don't hurt.Otherwise, the plot is sssllllooowww. This movie drags along. Don't get me wrong, the nostalgia associated with it (even at the time it was made) is great, but the action (if I can even use that word here) is definitely lacking.This is one of those films that launched a career for virtually everyone involved. Even proved TV actors (Dreyfus, Howard, Ford) first found real success in the movie industry with American Graffitti.Maybe I am so used to seeing movies with so many hot rods in it have more racing or chase scenes, but the one small 30sec. one we are treated to at the very end is just not satisfactory enough for the oil in my veins.I am not an expert on this period, but the look of the characters (greasers, preps, girls on rollerskates) seems to remind me more of a mid - late 1950's scene, not an early '60s. Even the soundtrack would seem to suggest that. Of the 41 tracks, only 11 of them were written or released after 1960, and one of them All Summer Long by the Beach Boys was released in 1964, two years after the movie was supposed to have taken place. The remaining 30 tracks all came from the '50s.Good to watch on a lazy afternoon one day when you don't have much else to do.
