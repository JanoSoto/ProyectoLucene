I never get tired of watching it again and again. This story, keeps you aware the entire duration of the movie, and the soundtrack, one of my favorites composed by Thomas Newman gives the tale even more grandeur. It's an impeccable direction from Frank Darabont, as he did on The Green Mile. Also it might make you reconsider some aspects of your life and to value more your time. The photography, costume, art direction, all of them are astonishing which deserved many more prizes and recognitions than it received. It's definitely one the best films made on the 90's and it's a piece of art int the film history. Nowadays I wish and I hope in Hollywood were made such great films as The Shawshank Redemption, but it seems lack of new ideas and making remakes every year. In my humble opinion, what Hollywood needs it's an entire REBOOT, not only with screenwriters but in direction and production.

The movie contains many scenes that portray science fiction, crime fiction, and drama. This movie seems like the atypical thriller film because Lola is in Germany, and has twenty minutes to find and bring 100,000 Deutschmarks to her boyfriend before he robs a supermarket. I thought that the editing was appropriate for this movie. If I was in Lola's shoes I would have the same kind of reactions and thoughts. The movie flashes back to the beginning of the story to where Manni has screwed up, and then leads you to what is happening in present time. There are also flash-forwards throughout the movie that show events that certain people are going to face in the movie. The fade in and fade out effects that the editors used between scenes made it very appropriate for the situation taking place in the movie. The sound use in this film was very effective because it made you feel like you were there and it really depicted the feeling of stress that the characters were going through. The scores used in this film were eliciting at some points but mainly appropriate at the times music was needed during the movie. The social context used in this film was present and understandable. It showed different stories and lives but also how they all connected in certain ways to one another. The social aspect of this film was short and to the point, which makes good use of social context. The film's cinematography was astounding. This aspect of film was what really caught and grabbed my attention the most. The camera angle in this film used all four views; birds eye, eye level, high angle, and low angle. The zoom in and zoom out technique in this film let you know that Lola was running faster and faster. By the time the camera would zoom out you would see that she wasn't running that fast. The camera angles help with this aspect of zooming as well. The close up shots were used at the correct times and made you really engage in the character that was talking. The significance of this film is that we always have choices in life. We can always break down different scenarios in order to make the right choice. This movie has had a lot of personal influences as to the way these characters feel in the film. I can relate to causing problems and screwing up much like this film has shown. This is what drew me into the film, along with other aspects. This film was very enjoyable to watch because it was fast-paced and kept you on the edge of your seat. I would recommend this film to people that enjoy sitting and paying attention to films. This film is so fast-paced that you really have to concentrate closely to what is going on in the storyline. There are many plot lines and this is why you really have to pay attention to what is going on. I recommend this movie with an 8.5 star rating.

This film could fall under melodrama as the characters and events are over exaggerated in a plot that repeats itself in a rippling effect way. Parts of the movie would even put it in a crime or romantic drama as the main character is going as far as committing crimes for the man she loves. The camera follows a German girl, Lola, as she tries to save her boyfriend, Manni, with a techno soundtrack which could also classify it as a music drama. There was an array of fast-cutting and montage transitions which were very appropriate for the film. It also included a lot of parallel editing to show Lola in relativity to her current situation and the other characters current situations. The editing was part of what kept this film edgy. The sounds used were very effective. It was synchronized with a great sound track. The songs were mostly original and catchy. There were very few silent moments, but when there were, they were perfectly placed. The score was fast paced with a techno soundtrack. It created a feeling of being in a rush and a bit of uneasiness. It keeps the audience wondering, can she make it?! or how will this result?! The cinematography included many different camera perspective positions, distances, and movements. The combination displayed the fast pace of the movie and life in general as Lola ran through the city trying to figure out how to get $100,000 within 20 minutes. This film was created in the late 90's in Germany, and the atmosphere and social context closely resembled this. The technology of the time such as cordless land phones and there still being a need for phone booths indicate that it was still in the 90's. The hair styles, clothing, and vehicles were also all realistic to this period in Germany. After watching this film there are a two different meanings that I felt could be taken away. The meaning of the movie could be that there are many different possibilities that can come out of a situation or choice, so choose wisely because the consequences could be detrimental and last a life time. Different choices will yield different results. There was a song in the film called, What a Difference a Day Makes, which really sums it up. Or based off of the last scene it's quite possible that the meaning of the movie is your best bet, is to just make a bet and that we really have no control over the outcomes. My own personal influences and biases come from this being a German movie. I lived there when I was younger, so most German movies, good or bad, resonate strongly with me. This film was enjoyable in the aspect of how it depicted the reality of how one small change can set off a ripple effect in not just one's own life, but many others. I did feel that the ripple effect could have been better thought out or explained though. I was very curious why the situation that was chosen was the one that was, rather than the situation that happened in the previous five minute or five minutes later. In many of the ripple scenes I felt like I was left wondering why and how? There were a few things that I found quite annoying though. For instance, Lola seems to be a screamer, causing glass to shatter. I felt these parts were a bit unnecessary and ridiculous. I did enjoy the what if factor the movie created though. I would recommend this movie for entertainment purposes only, but it is not a movie I would necessarily consider GOOD. Some of the repetitiveness also got old.

For instance, Lola seems to be a screamer, causing glass to shatter. I felt these parts were a bit unnecessary and ridiculous. I did enjoy the what if factor the movie created though. I would recommend this movie for entertainment purposes only, but it is not a movie I would necessarily consider GOOD. Some of the repetitiveness also got old. On a scale of 1 to 10 I would probably rate this movie a 7.

I was spending a weekend with my dad and it was on a Friday night. Usually when I see a movie for the first time on television, I either direct my attention to the screen to see what it is or direct my attention to something that I was doing. I came in right in the middle of the movie and I didn't know what it was about and I certainly didn't understand the concept behind it. But, I do remember laughing and having a good time while watching this movie. Now, looking back on it, it still makes me laugh even harder and longer.The story centers around a convict\/loser named H.I. McDunnough, (Nicholas Cage). His friends called him Hi. For the last several years, Hi has been robbing convenience stores and ending up in the slammer. After three times, Hi decides to go straight. He seeks the attraction of a pretty cop named Edwina Ed McDunnough, (Holly Hunter). Soon after, Hi and Ed get married. But, there's just one problem. They want to raise a family. So, the couple decides to keep trying. But according to a local gynecologist, Ed is infertile, meaning that she can't have kids. According to Hi's perspective, he can't plant his seed into Ed. Hopeless, the couple decides to steal one of the Arizona quints. One night, Hi and Ed steal one of the quints from a very wealthy businessman, (Sam McMurray), who owns a furniture store in Arizona.As the movie progresses, the humor starts to kick in when the local police and the F.B.I. conduct a manhunt on the missing quint. Meanwhile, two prisoners, (John Goodman and William Forsythe), escaped from prison and take shelter in Hi's home. But, the two prisoners want Hi to go along with them to pull off a heist. While that is going, another character comes walking into the story. An deranged and hellish lone motorcycle driver, (Randall 'Tex' Cobb), enters the story through Hi's dreams and his job is to find the quint and find the people who stole him. You can see that the movie is quite ambitious for its own kind. To tell you the truth, it is. This is the first comedy being made by the always entertaining movie-making duo, Joel and Ethan Coen. Their movies never ceased to amaze me. They have really carved out a reputation of movie- making with their witty scripts and their zany approach to a story. What surprises me is that this movie is actually their first comedy. Before the Coen brothers made Raising Arizona, they wrote and direct a very dark and violent neo-noir film, Blood Simple, which was released three earlier. This is quite surprising because Blood Simple was a very serious and sometimes bloody film that had a lot of twists and turns in it.Here, it's a change of pace. How they were to pull this one off is something that strikes me dumb. Watching the movie, I found myself laughing more than ever since I now understand the themes involved. One of the funniest scenes that I saw and it is the most significant one is when Cage's character robs a convenience store and disguised himself by putting pantyhose on his head. This plan doesn't since his wife leaves him behind, having him deal with the trigger-happy clerk and the police. The chase goes all over the place with Cage being chased by the clerk, the police and a pack of dogs. Even in the middle of the chase, Cage is even given a lift with an screaming hayseed driver. The way the chase sequence is shot makes it seems that the chase is being played as a cartoon. Maybe that's why the scene made me laugh the first time around. It's that sense of wacko humor that generates a laugh out of the audience. Not only the film's humor made me laugh, but toward the end of the movie, there's a bittersweet sense that ties the movie together with the characters trying hard to have a family.The writing by the brothers is very funny and even the performances by Cage, Hunter, Goodman and even Forsthye are excellent. I did believe that Nicholas Cage was really Hi. The fact that he sports a mustache and a dopey appearance when he is getting his mugshot done is very funny and also interesting. I'm not really a big fan of comedies because most of them are done pretty badly and never seem to hit me with their humor. That is true in today's movies. In today's movies, you can get away with everything. You can get a kick out of a audience that admired slapstick humor or bathroom humor. I understand that perspective. But, I enjoyed watching comedies that have funny dialogue in it. i believe that if you can make an audience laugh out loud with the dialogue, then that can be funny alone. The Coen brothers know how to generate a laugh out of the audience with their style of writing.Even in the today world, the Coen brothers are still going strong. Last year, they written and directed the Oscar-nominated picture, Inside Llewyn Davis. The brothers seem to really be shifting gears according to the genres. They can frightened you and tantalizes you with Blood Simple. They can make you laugh with Raising Arizona. They can compel you with Miller's Crossing. And they can jolt you with The Big Lebowski. I wonder what they're going to do next. ★★★ 1\/2 3 1\/2 stars.

The innumerable 'almost' love scenes between her and the Death character are an agony endless alternating over-the-shoulder close ups of her twitching her eyes at everything but him, and him Aspergering his gaze at everything else in the room but her.

His character is unable (at selective 'comic' moments) to understand common idioms while, at other times, is capable of layering on the profundity and metaphor with a trowel. At one point - after being told that another character was talking through his hat says No, he's talking through his lips! Ho ho ho.Claire Forlani plays the woman with whom he falls in love, and plays her with a subdued gaucheness so that in every scene she spends so much time twitching her lips (in a manner henceforth known as 'Zellwegering') and looking out of the corners of her eyes, that she looks like she's about to have a fit. The innumerable 'almost' love scenes between her and the Death character are an agony endless alternating over-the-shoulder close ups of her twitching her eyes at everything but him, and him Aspergering his gaze at everything else in the room but her. Whole hours of this stuff go by without them looking at each other once - and then they have sex which is more of the same with fewer clothes and less dialogue.In the end (the interminable endless end) the media mogul happily walks off with Death, after everyone has wrung every phony ounce of syrupy sentiment out of every single frame. (I nearly went into a sugar coma when Daddy and daughter had a final dance with to that saccharine hymn to trash sentimentality What a Wonderful World) And then! (Incoming bullshit overload!) Death isn't Death anymore! He's the guy the daughter fell in love with in the first act brought back from some ill-defined afterlife by a stroke of the writer's pen. The daughter says, I wish you could have known my dad, and off they walk to the accompaniment of glorious fireworks. All a bit sudden (well it would be if it wasn't all done so ponderously slowly) considering she hasn't even seen that her dad is dead, or, if she just somehow 'knew' it, she bothered to grieve even for a second. The poor bugger isn't even cold yet! and she doesn't shed a tear. But never mind, the movie needs a final sugar lump to end with so she's forgotten him for the vague promise of another go in the sack with Brad Pitt! And I don't think I want to know what Spike Lee made of the only more-than-two-line part doled out to a black actor, a real 'Magic N****r' if ever there was one. Only she, a dying old lady from de Carribiyan (thus even more primitive than her New York urbanised daughter) can see Death for who he is, Obeah mon. I gonna die, she says when he sees him for the first time. No obeah, sister. replies Pitt doing an Ali G. No duppy, no jumbie. Evera ting gon' be irey. No it isn't. I got type two diabetes from watching this film.

But it also has a whole lot of bad moments. Moments that are badly paced or that have incomplete cgi effects. After expectations were risen so high by the previous two films, this one was certain to be a big let down. It starts just after the events of Aliens. The ship crashes on a prison planet of around 20 convicts. Ripley is the only survivor and begins to realise that it was one of the Xenomorphs that sabotaged the ship. It quickly becomes a fight for survival as Ripley works with the prisoners to destroy the monster. It's not a bad story (even if the logic of putting 20 prisoners alone on a planet is questionable) but I would question the decision to kill off the rest of the survivors in the last film. They were very likable personalities and wouldn't have needed any exposition to build their characters. Instead we're left with 20 characters who we never learn much about and none of whom are memorable. I could go years without watching Aliens and remember all of those crew members. I've only just watched Alien 3 and feel like I've already forgotten most of the characters. But whilst the prisoners may be forgettable, luckily we do still get Ripley. Whilst the character isn't really expanded on, Weaver does bring an great performance to the role. This time she shows a true sense of anguish. The feeling that there is no hope. She shows total despair knowing that she has lost everything. But she never gives up. She refuses to back down and keeps fighting no matter what demonstrating a very real and grounded sense of bravery. She's one of the few reason that this film was in any way worth watching.But unfortunately the film does screw up the Xenomorph. Largely because we see too much of him. In the previous two films then the Alien barely even gets any screen time, with our image of the alien being built up through quick glimpses to create a more mysterious and threatening creature. Here he appears on screen far more and we see too much of him. He's less imposing and seems more like a run of the mill monster than anything else. .On top of this the decision to use computer generated effects to make the monster was a bad one. This was before effects could create a realistic figure and because of that when the alien does appear through cgi it never looks like it's really there. Worse yet many of these cgi shots were incomplete or done badly, causing many shots of the alien in the final chase to be extremely green or have a weird colour scheme. It's particularly unfortunate as when practical effects are used in the film they do seem genuinely impressive. What's annoying about this film is that it does have some brilliant elements to it. It could have been a decent film with the claustrophobic prison scenery and returning to the simplistic survival horror of the original Alien movie. But it's mixed with the likes of slow paced action scenes and the entire prison population having either underdeveloped or uninteresting characters. Probably this comes down to studio interference as Fincher cited it as the reason he left the film during editing as it did not let him achieve his vision of the franchise. He even believed it was so bad that he has since disowned the film. It does still have some enjoyable moments, even if they are few in number. Just don't expect it to live up to either of the previous films in the franchise.

The voyage that follows is accompanied by a very loud Hindi chant full of tablas and wailing, inappropriate and unconscionable. The tale continues as Cage and Phoenix track down the three culprits, who turn out to be Stormare (great in Fargo), Gandolfini, and the butcher in the mask, a nobody and something of a Mamma's boy despite his flabby heft.Two thirds of the way through, the film collapses in on itself, piece by piece, with little in the way of redeeming value. I'll give an example of a redeeming incident though. It's a piece of dialog. Peter Stormare, the snuff film's director and photographer, has just been shot through the neck and is doing his dying swan fall to the floor. Not this way, not this way, he mutters to himself. It should be something more CINEMATIC. It's not only the funniest line in the film; it's the ONLY funny line.I'll give one example of how to turn a story that begins with some promise into a commercial piece of mindless garbage. A lot of film time is lavished on Catherine Keener as Cage's wife, although they're not often seen together on the screen. However, they're constantly calling one another, each time signing off with, I love you, followed by the other's I love you. I figured, okay, Keener -- with that aquiline nose and those alarming zygomatic arches -- is a splendid actress. She really is. So she's going to be kidnapped, along with their baby, right? Wrong. She's never in jeopardy. So why is she so prominently featured. So that after all that lovey-dovey stuff she can torment the already abused Cage by taking the tot and leaving him. (Not to worry, she returns at the end, with no realistic excuse either for leaving in the first place or for returning.) And here's how she tells Cage she's leaving. The poor guy has just had the hell kicked and beaten out of him. He manages to stumble all bloody into his home and Keener begins shrieking at him -- Look at yourself! and How do you think I FEEL not knowing where you are? It's a typical conflict between cop and wife. (Cf., for instance, Heat.) But there has been absolutely no hint of the magnitude, or even the existence, of her dissatisfaction before. It comes out of nowhere except the writer's desire to add still more dramatic fluff to a movie about an already sordid subject.I was pretty disgusted by this point. The climax is the usual mud wrestling in a cemetery. When two men fight and one is armed, the gun or knife is generally knocked from the hand and there is an obligatory shot of the weapon skittering along the floor. In this movie -- FOUR TIMES. We're no longer in the realm of imagination but of a ritual shot that is almost religious in its invariability.And yet, despite the terrible let-down, those performances can't be easily dismissed. Not a clinker in the bunch. They sparkle among the rain-drenched, littered, dark streets of the ugly part of New York, the leafless barren hills of Appalachia, and the gloomy cellars of Los Angeles.Want a name of a particularly appealing actress? The dead girl's mother, living alone in a wretched shack somewhere in rural Pennsylvania or West Virginia, dying to get Cage to sit down and join her for dinner or at least a drink. Not for sex but to relieve for a few minutes the social vacuum she seems locked into. Her name is Amy Morton. And her part may be the best-written in the film.

I'm 30 mins in & I can tell you this is a marvelous Dracula movie It is faithful to the source material (except for the closing scene)but with Herzog at the controls & color available (though little used) it is the visual embodiment of the story of Dracula. Herzog is the world's best Documentarian & you wouldn't think that would lead to great fiction. In his case it does. He directed Aguirre The Wrath of God & Fitzcarraldo along with many others including, Signs of Life. It's images, images, images conceived in such a way as to perfectly portray his subject matter & give rise in his viewer to what is going on in that character mentally & emotionally. No one is his equal at this. Back to the movie which anyone would not believe a man whose fame grew from documentaries would be capable of in a horror story. This is Halloween the holiday in a disc folks.Finished it & I must say what an achievement. There is not one scene of violence in the whole movie unless you call Jonathan Harker nicking his finger at the dinner table violence. The ending scene strangely does not remotely follow the book & I will dock it a full point. 1\/2 for not following the book & 1\/2 because to me, the ending scene is the weakest part of the story. Dracula seems to be completely unaware of when crosses (supposed to cause Dracula great pain) are in the scene. Dracula carries his coffin through a graveyard of crosses with no reaction then, when he puts his coffin down he turns & sees 2 that are 1\/10 the size & cowers. When Dracula visits Lucy in her bedroom she is wearing a silver cross (extremely potent) but Dracula has no reaction again. I don't understand or forgive that. It is the first mistake of that magnitude I've seen in any of his films.I can just hear the world's blood & gore horror crowd complaining about this atmospheric & apprehensive Dracula. The opening scene is perhaps the finest in the Horror genre. There is no blood at all to speak of. There is no crescendo after crescendo of horror. What there is is an oppressive & brooding sense of evil that is eminent, which never goes away, but carries throughout the common scenes as well as the uncommon encounters. I loved it. 8.5 out of 10 stars. Did I mention I was PO'ed about the crosses? Except for that though, the scene construction is superbly Herzog. I loved his use of music too.XXXXXXXXXXXXXMy wife came home early to say, Let's watch Nosferatu with Klaus. I allowed my arm to be twisted. I also came up with another dissatisfaction. It's the character of Van Helsing. I understand they were intent on showing Dracula as a sympathetic character & to have a monomaniacal foe of all that's holy would be counterproductive. The milk-toast they make of him though is just wrong. This one is not the Dr. that rides in as help in a time of trouble. He is rather the epitome of the country Dr. Many have done this story with no Van Helsing at all & I think that would have been better. Keep the character that they used but don't call him Van Helsing. I'll deduct another 1\/2 point for that & make it 8 out of 10 stars after a second viewing. As my wife said after seeing it, Aguirre was 10 out of 10. This one isn't, yet the imagery is as good & the brooding evil never leaves. Nosferatu The Vampyre (English version) On my disc it isn't cut at all. Not even one scene. The English version comes from a dirtier source print. Snow is bad at the beginning & slowly fades for about 20-25 mins then it is gone. I didn't notice a whole lot of camera angle changes but what was evident was an overall use of slightly less light. You can really see that in the back-lighting of Count Dracula as he walks down the corridor to Jonathon Harker's room. It is noticeable throughout however. It steals the sheen off of fabrics causing it to appear less contrast was used. The ending doesn't change at all.My wife pointed out & I agree that Shadow of the Vampire is better done but not by much. Max Schreck in that is as eerie & imposing with more latitude given for intensity.

It draws us in as if we are apart of a great movement showing us how to open our minds and explore the endless possibilities. Shawshank walks you through detailed moments in the film, which is narrated in a soothing voice to involve us in a story of men who have built a union in prison. The film begins telling a story of a young successful banker, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) convicted for the murder of his wife and her lover who is sentenced to two life prison terms consecutively. Andy is transferred to Shawshank State Prison where he meets a fellow inmate, Ellis Red Redding (Morgan Freeman) serving a life sentence as well. Andy's demeanor was quiet and reserved, typical of a new prisoner. As he walks through the prison gates you hear a voice, looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over. Red soon realizes he judged Andy inappropriately that he wouldn't last in the prison sector longer than 2 weeks and later becomes very close friends. Andy initially jeopardizes his life to build trust and friendships with others in prison including the warden and prison guards. There is a turn of events enabling him to regain his life back through manipulation and self-determination. The double cross and trickery that is done to the Warden and the head prison guard at the end of the movie is so gratifying to see play out. Red is finally paroled after he told the board that he really didn't care how they voted after 40 years of being behind bars and two rejected parole hearings. His emotions of defiance and inspiration, ultimately is what grants his freedom. The movie will take you through a host of emotions, which has a great ending. The name of the prison and redemption refers to the action of redeeming. The movie shows how one can recover from past mistakes through resiliency. The old adage, What does not hurt you makes you stronger holds true to moving forward with life and starting over.I believe the editing in the film was appropriate because the scenes were cut at just the right and precise time to introduce the next scene and new characters. It was not choppy and the movie flowed perfectly spanning over 20 years.The photography of The Shawshank Redemption takes the realism approach to how the scenes are displayed and captured. The scenes that are inside the prison are gloomy and full of darkness portraying fear, authority, and violence. They make the viewer feel emotionally connected to the circumstances exposed in prison with the characters. When the inmates are out in the prison yard the film shots are open and bright, though it is still a prison, the outside scenes have a different feel to them. This is because when the other population is outside, it is a small touch of freedom, though there are guards everywhere and barbed wire fences restricting their every move. This may be the only time where inmates feel a sense of freedom or autonomy. The film was very enjoyable but did move along very slowly. It was interesting to see how a man who was innocent of a crime he was convicted of and never vindicated. Also, in the process it was intriguing to watch Andy manipulate the warden and the prison guards to get what he needed and wanted to fulfill his true desires. It's a must see movie because it was a good compelling story line based on a man's courage, will, and tenacity to never give up. Despite the many obstacles Andy faced almost daily, he had the ability to maintain his innocence and intelligence while staying focused on his ultimate goal of obtaining his independence again.

I'm not sure about that statement, but the action and suspense, and the Bond intrigue alone make it worth the watching. If you're new to Bond movies and you've only seen the latest three in the series&#x97;Skyfall, Quantum of Solace, and Casino Royale, you must go back to the building of the Bond character and all that goes with it to understand the James Bond persona. This movie's main genre is a spy, action, thriller, yet after twenty-three Bond movies, I believe that Bond movies alone is a legitimate sub-genre. The Goldfinger movie is classic Bond and a must see. The film begins with the classic, rich, and identifiable Golden Girl song alongside gold-laden dancing Bond girls. Then, within the first thirty minutes the viewer finds Bond interacting with M, his boss and the head of the British Secret Service, and Q, the wizard of all Bond gadgetry. Moneypenny, M's secretary, exchanges some brief, cloaked, flirtatious remarks with Bond. In addition, the Aston Martin is introduced. And, not the least, Bond beds a woman who ends up dead and painted in gold! Thus begins the larger story as Bond works to find out how the psychopath, Auric Goldfinger, sends his gold overseas, illegally. Bond then ultimately discovers that Fort Knox is in danger as the mighty Goldfinger plans to infiltrate this well guarded facility to become the wealthiest gold baron in the world. How he plans to do this and how Bond and crew foil his plan must be seen by watching the film. No spoilers here. Some classic Bond lines appear in this third film in the series that will be used over and over to build the Bond character. When asked what drink he wants, Bond says a martini, shaken, not stirred. More than once when he is asked his name he says, Bond, James Bond. And when Bond asks Goldfinger's personal pilot her name, she openly says Pussy Galore. This use of a double entendre for the names of Bond girls becomes a staple in Bond films. This film moves from Miami Beach to Switzerland to Baltimore and finally Kentucky as Bond chases Goldfinger. (The camera shows off the scenery in Miami and Switzerland as is to be expected in a Bond movie.) Bond is often imprisoned during this long chase. All the while his friends in the CIA are monitoring his moves as much as possible. Bond repeatedly gets out of life threatening situations and somehow avoids the wrath of Oddjob (Goldfinger's manservant) and his slicing hat! Looking back over fifty years of Bond movies, some scenes may seem predictable, yet the formula used for this series must have something going for it as the next Bond movie is currently in the works in 2014! It's hard to find any series that has survived this long. Sean Connery as James Bond, Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore, Gert Frobe as Auric Goldfinger, and Shirly Eaton as Jill Masterson give superb performances as they were nominated for many awards.

I'm not sure about that statement, but the action and suspense, and the Bond intrigue alone make it worth the watching. If you're new to Bond movies and you've only seen the latest three in the series&#x97;Skyfall, Quantum of Solace, and Casino Royale, you must go back to the building of the Bond character and all that goes with it to understand the James Bond persona. This movie's main genre is a spy, action, thriller, yet after twenty-three Bond movies, I believe that Bond movies alone is a legitimate sub-genre. The Goldfinger movie is classic Bond and a must see. The film begins with the classic, rich, and identifiable Golden Girl song alongside gold-laden dancing Bond girls. Then, within the first thirty minutes the viewer finds Bond interacting with M, his boss and the head of the British Secret Service, and Q, the wizard of all Bond gadgetry. Moneypenny, M's secretary, exchanges some brief, cloaked, flirtatious remarks with Bond. In addition, the Aston Martin is introduced. And, not the least, Bond beds a woman who ends up dead and painted in gold! Thus begins the larger story as Bond works to find out how the psychopath, Auric Goldfinger, sends his gold overseas, illegally. Bond then ultimately discovers that Fort Knox is in danger as the mighty Goldfinger plans to infiltrate this well guarded facility to become the wealthiest gold baron in the world. How he plans to do this and how Bond and crew foil his plan must be seen by watching the film. No spoilers here. Some classic Bond lines appear in this third film in the series that will be used over and over to build the Bond character. When asked what drink he wants, Bond says a martini, shaken, not stirred. More than once when he is asked his name he says, Bond, James Bond. And when Bond asks Goldfinger's personal pilot her name, she openly says Pussy Galore. This use of a double entendre for the names of Bond girls becomes a staple in Bond films. This film moves from Miami Beach to Switzerland to Baltimore and finally Kentucky as Bond chases Goldfinger. (The camera shows off the scenery in Miami and Switzerland as is to be expected in a Bond movie.) Bond is often imprisoned during this long chase. All the while his friends in the CIA are monitoring his moves as much as possible. Bond repeatedly gets out of life threatening situations and somehow avoids the wrath of Oddjob (Goldfinger's manservant) and his slicing hat! Looking back over fifty years of Bond movies, some scenes may seem predictable, yet the formula used for this series must have something going for it as the next Bond movie is currently in the works in 2014! It's hard to find any series that has survived this long. Sean Connery as James Bond, Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore, Gert Frobe as Auric Goldfinger, and Shirly Eaton as Jill Masterson give superb performances as they were nominated for many awards.

They are usually just rushed cash-grabs to make money off of a successful property, but occasionally they can be just as good, if not better, than the original film, as rare as this is. (The Empire Strikes Back, Terminator 2, Aliens, The Dark Knight, and Spider-Man 2 are examples of these.) Prequels are not so different, and are even harder to pull off. So, normally, the 1974 follow-up to Francis Ford Coppola's 1972 masterpiece The Godfather would have a lot to do in order to top the original. But, despite this, The Godfather Part II, is, in my opinion, not only better than the original, but also the best movie of all time. (I take back what I said in my review of the original about it being the best ever made, I hadn't seen this one yet.)The Godfather Part II is actually two films in one. Expertly presenting two story lines, one sequel and one prequel to the original, half of the film follows late-1950s Michael Corleone, now as the head of the Corleone crime family, expanding his power and picking off his enemies, becoming less and less like the man at the beginning of the previous film. The other half follows his father, Vito, in 1920s New York as he creates the empire that later gets passed down to Michael. Both stand out on their own, but the two story lines, brilliantly put together, create a masterpiece that is yet to be matched.Like the first movie, the best element of this movie is the acting. Al Pacino returns as Michael, in what is undoubtedly his best performance of the two films. (I can't say the best of his career, because these two are the only movies of his I have seen. Sorry, Scarface fans.) He is perfect as a man who, through gaining power, loses his humanity. If you have read my review for Lawrence of Arabia, you'll remember I named some performances that would be on a list of the Top 10 Best Movie Performances. I have no doubts that Pacino in this film would be right on there.Before watching this, I had doubts as to how the movie would make do without screen legend Marlon Brando, as his character is twenty-five years younger, and so played by Robert De Niro. (I haven't yet seen Taxi Driver or Raging Bull.) But after watching it, I feel that he is just as good, and he really deserved his Oscar win for Best Supporting Actor. He is so good that I can't decide who did a better job, him or Brando. Good thing he wasn't cast in the first film, otherwise the world wouldn't have this terrific performance.Although Pacino and De Niro are the highlights in this movie's cast, the others are excellent as well. Robert Duvall as Michael's stepbrother, Tom Hagen, really sells his conflicted loyalty\/fear of his changing stepbrother. Lee Strasberg as Hyman Roth, a man who Michael is trying to kill, is excellent. Diane Keaton as Kay, Michael's wife, really shows how she is frightened at what he has now become. And, of course, there is John Cazale as Michael's brother Fredo, the weakling who tries to be stronger than everyone says,but things don't go according to plan. (I won't go into specifics.)Just like the first film, another great aspect is the script. Doing one story line would be hard enough, but the fact that the movie does both so well, so flawlessly, is just amazing. It reintroduces the characters we already know, and take them to further places and develop them more, and also introduces more. It features parallels to the first movie, with similar scenes that show how things have changed. This installment also feels more epic than the first one, as things get bigger and darker.The film is also marvelous in its technical aspects as well. The score by Nino Rota, once again, is beautifully haunting, and even better than in the previous film. The cinematography by Gordon Willis continues to shine. (Even though, ironically, he himself has regretted some scenes that he felt were too dark.) The production design is fantastic, and it helps with the epic scope I mentioned previously. The violence is more realistic, and somewhat more graphic, which gives it a better impact. The editing is also good, as the two story lines are connected beautifully. If I have one problem with the movie, it is that it is slower than the previous film, as it's longer by twenty-five minutes, and 3.3 hours makes for a pretty long movie. But, taking into account how brilliant the rest of the movie is, that can be forgiven.This film is so amazing, it astonishes on every level. I may have been disappointed that the first film only won three Oscars, but fortunately this one managed to get six, including a second Best Picture, which were all well deserved. (I have no idea how Pacino didn't get Best Actor, but, according to Some Like It Hot, Nobody's perfect.) Clearly topping the original, The Godfather Part II is the Best Film of All Time, so of course, I have to give it a 10\/10 rating.
