Also, I thought it could've used more sharks in general, but that's just me. This movie is also a tiny bit predictable in that you can tell pretty much who's gonna buy it early on.

I never met the man, but with reading his biographies and watching his movies countless times, I can understand what the man is trying to say through his films.  I was upset that we will never see the much awaited Kubrick film titled A.I. (ARTIFICIAL INTELLENGENCE), but I am pleased that we will see one more film of Kubrick's titled EYES WIDE SHUT. For months, even before Kubrick's death, I was highly eager for this film.  One of the best director's of all time first film in twelve years (since 1987 FULL METAL JACKET).  And it came no surprise that the film kept getting delayed, (from December of 1998, to March 1999, and finally July 16, 1999).  But I knew Kubrick would do that. One of his most famous tales is that the MGM executives were upset at Kubrick for delaying 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY.  One of the MGM exceutives asked Kubrick, is that the title of the movie, or when it's coming out? But the time has come, July 16th has finally arrived.  Before I saw a exclusive sneak of EYES WIDE SHUT, I hyped myself up for this film.  I watched parts of 2001, and all of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE on my DVD player at home, the night before I saw EYES WIDE SHUT.  And when I saw EYES WIDE SHUT, I was prepared. My heart was racing when I saw the Warner Bros. symbol, then the words Warner Bros. Presents Tom Cruise Nicole Kidman In A Stanely Kubrick Film.  The eerie carnival-waltz music playing in the background, while the viewer sees the back-side of Nicole Kidman, as she's undressing.  The viewer sees Kidman, undress until she's completely nude.  Then the words EYES WIDE SHUT appear.  And from there on, I went though the most complex plot and thought provoking film that I have seen since THE MATRIX.  This film really took me out of my theater seat, and into the world of Dr. Bill Hartford (Tom Cruise). This is a brilliant film from a brilliant director!  Stanley Kubrick proved that throughout his carrer, he didn't make one bad movie.  And I feel that EYES WIDE SHUT should be placed with Kubrick's other classics DR. STRANGELOVE, THE KILLING, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, 2001, THE SHINING, and the rest of his films.  This is a film that you have to go to, and please bring your intellegence, otherwise, it won't make any sense.  After watching this film with a couple of friends, we discussed how complex the plot was of this film.  And days later, we still talk about certain scenes and plot points in the film. It's like going to a crime scene, and trying to figure out who did the murder, and what was the motive. What other director can do this to a film!  Kubrick tells both so much, and so little.  He let's the viewer think about what's going on, but doesn't show it.  He'll let the viewer think about what's going to happen, but won't say.  Very few director's in Hollywood or in the film industry will do this.  Instead they would rather entertain the viewer. They tell the story, let the viewer know what happend, and what's going to happen to them in the future, and then give them a happy ending.  Kubrick isn't like that, he doesn't make entertainment, he makes art.  2001 is one of the few films that I would say, deserves a gold frame around it's screen, and placed in the Louve in Paris. EYES WIDE SHUT is another film that deserves that same treatment.  This is a work of art,the editing, the cinematography, the acting, the errie music, and the story are all done with a touch of brillance.  This is a worthy film of Kubrick's. Unlike other film critic's I respect Stanley Kubrick and his family very much.  So out of respect, I will not reveal any of the plot points or discuss the plot.  The plot of the film is both too simple and complex to discuss.  It's something that needs to been seen, to understand.  But I will mention this, Kubrick fans will notice Kubrick using some of his famous directing moves in this film. The Christmas party in EYES WIDE SHUT looks very similar to the Gold Ballroom scene in THE SHINING.  The following the character around the huge building without cutting, or doing a different camera angle.  The unique camera angles, the very rapid long shot to extreme close up shot (done in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE when Alex sees his old droogs become officer's.  And in THE SHINING when Wendy sees the shocking mirror reflection of the word murder).  And the single character standing alone in a big room, or walking down the street. No surprise, I found this not only one of the best films of the year, but also of all time.  I'm sad that were not going to see another Kubrick film.  But I am glad that I lived in a time to see his work.  To be both influenced and astonished at the same time, while watching his movies.

Like many people, I'm not really sure WHAT I think of this film right now.  It was odd yet it was constantly compelling.  And as for the sex  got news for ya folks, there ain't a lot of it.  Save for the orgy scene(s), some fantasy stuff and the scene which the teaser trailer came from (the one with the Cruises making out in front of the mirror), it's mainly a lot of subplots that are based around sex and that are about sex but not necessarily featuring sex itself.As for the performances themselves, I'll try to give a brief review of each of the main actor's roles.  First, Tom.  Tom is AMAZING in this film.

You have to applaud him for having the guts for using shots right out of the first two Jaws films. But as good as this film was in some parts ( and it is really good in some parts ) it is just an inch or two off being great.Lake Placid is about a giant crocodile that has inhabited a small Maine lake.  The lake isn't even called Lake Placid, but that is a whole other story.  The beginning starts off with a guy from the Department of Games and Fishing searching for beavers so he can tag them.  And the opening ten minutes are a true homage to the fear Jaws presented us with.  And it is here that Miner has some of his strongest work in his whole career.  He uses the camera to make us feel the unknown danger that is imminently lurking in the water.  We feel for the safety of the diver and we don't even like him that much.  Now that is good film making.When the diver is under water, we see lots of shots from behind, as if the unseen terror is about to pounce on him, and then, boom, the first false scare.  That moment in the film had me full of optimism because it made me jump.  And not just a small twitch, I mean it made me leap out of my seat. That doesn't happen too often in horror films now a days.  But here it does.Finally when the attack does happen, we are treated to an exact shot of one of the scariest shots from Jaws 2.  I am not going to reveal which one, but you have to see the film just for this part.  It is a great shot and it really sets the tone for the rest of the film.After the opening death, we meet the main players of the film.  And this is where I am a little skeptical of the film.  It's not that these characters aren't done well, it's that they could have been done a whole lot better with perhaps another re-write.  Some of the dialogue is very funny but it is hollow in some ways.  Oliver Platt gets off some of the best lines and that is more of a testament to his timing and ability than it is to the script. But having said that, the film does move pretty quickly.  And we are treated to some more scary shots from the water.  To me, there is nothing more scary than what may or may not be in the water.  The anticipation of death is much more scary than death itself.  Lake Placid takes that notion and does a great job, most of the time making it work.The one part of the film that is absolutely terrible though is the last ten minutes of the film.  It is hollow.  It just happens and then everyone goes home.  There is no real climax, no real tension and that is too bad because it takes away from the rest of the film.  And Steve Miner is known for this. He is great out of the gate, but he fades at the end.  He did it in the final Friday the 13th and he does it here.  It's like he uses all of his clever ideas at the beginning and then has nothing left for the end and then just closes up shop.Lake Placid almost succeeds.  Almost.  But it ultimately lets you down when it showed such promise throughout.  I enjoyed most of this film and you should give it a chance.  Deep Blue Sea is coming out in a few weeks and that should be quite good.  Consider this a prelude to that film.  It's good, but not quite great.

In case you ever wanted to know what kind of film you might get if you happen to have good actors and a bad story we now have an answer.  It's called Eyes Wide Shut.More than any other director Kubrick was always able to sniff out a great story.  Often the stories he chose to make became emblems for an entire a generation witness such works as 2001, Dr Strangelove, or a Clockwork Orange.  One can only wonder then what on Earth was he thinking when he decided to make this film.  For the story premise of Eyes Wide Shut is singularly awful.The movie revolves around the psychological and emotional tailspin Tom Cruise's character is thrown into when his wife (Nicole Kidman) confesses a sexual fantasy she once had for a sailor.  A fantasy, I might add, she never acted upon.  It is the imagined picture of his wife being humped by an unknown sailor that is, if you'll pardon the pun, the driving narrative force, propelling Cruise, as a New York doctor, on a journey to lift the lid on the many dimensions of his own repressed sexual desires - necrophilia, and so on.Now to start with, what's absolutely unconvincing is this film's very premise - that his wife's confession could throw Tom into such turmoil.  I'm sorry I just don't buy it.  And each time the film cuts again, and again to the black and white image of the Kidman\/sailor imagined humpfest the more unconvincing the premise gets.  Then, what's even worse is the sexual\/psychological journey Tom end ups actually traveling - from heart of gold prostitute, to nutty costume shop owner, to masked orgy.  It's simultaneously so trite and so bizarre as to be laughable.  Which is really too bad because much of the rest of the film is pretty good.  I mean, Kubrick certainly knows how to make a movie.  Technically the film is a pleasure to watch.  The camera movements, the sets, the lighting, even the acting is marvelous.   And some scenes in and of themselves are great.  There's a wonderful bit between Cruise and a gay hotel clerk.  And another one between Cruise and a grieving woman which borders on David Lynch.  As the woman sits next to her father's corpse, and Cruise tries to comfort her, she suddenly confess her love (and lust) and begins to shove her tongue down Tom's throat.

The Muppets themselves, one of the longest-enduring comedy ensembles in TV and film history, retain their appeal to both kids and grownups, mixing deliberately bad jokes with touches of the absurd (take a look at the bathroom in the Muppets house toward the beginning) and exquisitely timed set pieces such as the poker game with Rizzo the Rat and Pepe the Prawn. Most of my favorite parts of the movie were bits of Muppet business that had nothing to do with the plot, and the filmmakers might have done better to keep going in this vein with a day in the life of the Muppets movie.  I bet it would have been fabulous.However, someone had a brilliant idea for a plot, centered on the question, Just what kind of creature IS Gonzo, anyway?  Muppets from Space starts off promisingly with this question, evoking a certain amount of pathos in the process.  Then Gonzo begins getting messages that he believes to be from his kinfolk, and from outer space!From there the plot takes over, and though Kermit, Miss Piggy, Animal, Rizzo, Pepe, and Bobo the Bear (as an oddball receptionist at the E.T.-watching bureau who serve as the bad guys) get some good bits of business, they're swallowed up in the necessity of moving the plot along. Worse, the action moves so quickly (presumably to keep the movie length down within the average little kid's attention span) that any depth the story might have is utterly lost.  Sure, it's a kids movie, and maybe kids are more tolerant of shallow but fast plots.  The best kids movies, however, aren't just functional, they're magical.  A few extra minutes, maybe as few as 5 or 10 if done right, could have added some much-needed magic to this movie.The human roles are stripped down past the point of iconicity to the cardboard level.  The most effective have little screen time; a man in black who goes mano a mano with Miss Piggy, a female guard who falls for Animal's, uh, animalistic ways, and a scientist who sounds like he'd rather be a prison guard and treats his lab rats accordingly.  The humans with more screen time, such as the main villain (the head of the E.T.-watching bureau), don't come off as well.  When the humans are less believable than the Muppets, something's wrong.(Of course the filmmakers might have stripped down the human roles on purpose, precisely to make the Muppets more believable as characters.  If so, I think they were mistaken.  They should have aimed for parity of believability, as with Bob Hoskins and the toons in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, or the best episodes of the original Muppet Show.)Finally, though the music (a selection of '70s funk oldies) was very good, there was too much of it; the fimmakers should have kept the space-related items (Shining Star, Outa-Space, and Flash Light rewritten as Space Flight) and the set-piece toward the end where all the funk pays off, and jettisoned the rest.Next time, I hope the people behind the Muppets either pay more serious attention to their plot, or else keep the plot as far out of the way as possible.

Added to that, he once again left gaping plot flaws and inconsistencies in what turned out to be a disappointing script. Unbalanced and flawed.One of the joys of watching a film is not knowing what is going to happen, and even if you are pretty sure of what will happen through inductive reasoning. Though we may have all been fairly confident that Luke would play a pretty major role in the destruction of the first death star, we didn't actually know. With some level of disbelief-suspension we are able to let go and enjoy the battle that ensues during the mission. Han blasts in, Luke `uses the force' and the audience is happy. I had no doubt at any stage during the race scene in TPM that Anakin was going to win his race with the vessel that he built with his own slave-hands. Good for him, but I found the whole scene a trifle tiring and pointless. If  Qui-Gon Jin can leap into a passing aircraft to evade danger, and can hold his own against Maul for a while, then surely he could have used Jedi mind powers on Anakin's enslaver. No need for mummy to carry on living a life of depravity, or for the young lad to be separated from her. Perhaps, if he had been kept under her wing until he was really ready he wouldn't have become an emotional retard.I suffered from a distinct lack of ability to believe all of the ridiculous and largely irrelevant situations that were being presented to me in this film. The light sabre is supposedly a pure energy blade with no mass, while the electromagnetically generated arc wave creates a strong gyroscopic effect that is surprisingly difficult to handle. OK. So how come Maul can handle a double-ended one and stave off two apparently talented opponents simultaneously? (I know Obi-Wan was a junior, but he did have some talents) Queen Amidala seemed to change from one magnificent gown to another continually through the film (not at all like the simple pithy garments that her `subjects' wore) applying fresh make-up and moaning about her own ineffectualness. Apparently she was an elected queen. Why did her subjects elect her? Because she had a proven track record for dealing with economy and international relations? Or was it for her superfluous fashionable magnanimity? Beats me. And how is it that technology levels are so much higher in this episode than in Star Wars? Don't give me that `there is a really big war in episode 3' rubbish. It is a known fact that technology levels do not recede as a result of war, but they actually improve somewhat. Especially for the winning side. Oh, and could someone please tell me why Darth Maul was given virtually no speaking parts? Aside from the fight scenes, he was more an extra than a player and I found this deeply disappointing. This film needed a main proponent of the opposition's cause.We could bang on about plot flaws all day, but for now it seems to me that there is a far more important shortcoming in this movie that Star Wars certainly didn't have, and that is likeable characters. A generation of people have grown up wanting to be\/dress up as Princess Leia, Han Solo, Darth Vader, a Storm Trooper, an Imperial Guard, Boba  Fett, one of the Catina musicians or Chewie. We could see them out in force at the opening of TPM in queues around the world. Aside from Queen Amidala and Darth Maul what new costumes will people be wearing in the next set of opening queues? A Battle Droid or Jar Jar? Me thinks not. There were very few things to really like about this set of characters, most particularly their pathetic names. They were not emotionally provoking enough. Computer animation is a far cry from getting a guy to dress up in a really good suite. Animation encourages alienation. Star Wars was so popular because of the great costumes that the Imperial forces got to wear.

Everyone in the theater groaned at the ending, expecting a big payoff that never came. Kubrick may have been a master, but I never thought it would be of porn. I'm glad Roger Ebert explained the point of this movie tonight, or I certainly would have missed it. I gave it a lenient 5 of 10 because of Cruise's performance what it could have been!

And thankfully it was.Sure this movie isn't without it's flaws. The first 20 minutes or so seem very awkward and I was really thinking that if it carried on this way it was going to be the biggest let down in movie history. But seeing as George Lucas hasn't directed a movie in some time he obviously had to get into the swing of things again and I was prepared to let it go. The film did pick up immensely though and although there was very little background to any of the plot and practically no character development whatsoever, the film built up nicely to an absolutely blinding lightsaber battle finale. I'll go with most critics view that this film just opened loads of possibilities and then left them to be explored in later episodes which was a shame as I'm sure George Lucas could have stuffed enough in there to keep us satisfied, add a little more substance to the movie and have plenty more surprises for later installments.And I don't know if it's just me or not but considering the story is supposed to be set 40 years ago the technology of the age seems vastly superior to that seen in the other 3 movies which is strange...Of the acting I thought Ewan McGregor did a great job of playing Obi-Wan Kenobi. There were times when he spoke where I swear it sounded just like Alec Guiness. But unfortunately Liam Neeson gives the most wooden and uncaring performance I've ever seen for some completely unfathomable reason. Natalie Portman is good as the Queen AND her handmaiden Padme and the character voice are good if slightly cartoonish. I liked Watoo the owner of the junk yard who sounded just like Marlon Brando from the Godfather but the crappy dubbed sounding Japanese accents of those aliens at the beginning that worked for Darth Sidious. Pleeeeeaase!!! There are some nice humourous touches too like Jabba the Hutt introducing the pod race and then his aid waking him up when it's all over. And the botched heroics of Jar Jar Binks who, despite what you might have heard is not nearly as annoying as you might think. Still, with that said the action sequences are faultless and keep you on the edge of your seat, the FX are, as expected, stunning and although it doesn't quite have that Star Wars buzz (partly I feel due to the new mediums and technologies used in TPM.)there are still enough ties to the current Star Wars universe to give it good continuity.When I came out of the cinema I thought to myself was I satisfied with that as a part of the Star Wars Saga...?. And I came to the conclusion that Yes I bloody was and I can't wait until Episode 2. Come on George, get your finger out, do you really expect us to wait until 2002..?

The film it reminded me of was The Sting. On the whole I enjoyed the performances of all the actors but was particularly surprised by Dwight Yoakam.  There were two particular moments of his performance that struck me.  One being the first view we got of the Nitro and the little comments about Avis liking it kept under the bed. The other being when a bottle of nitro falls from his pocket in the train, he catches it with his foot.  This man can act as well as sing! His delivery of the lines and his facial expressions were good.  I totally believed in the geeky character Dwight Yoakam portrayed.  I saw him in Sling Blade and was impressed but had not seen any other performances so how could I judge?  Time to start listening to his music I think.  I felt the story began to wander towards the end of the film and I have seen better.  Mind you I have seen a lot worse!  Not a bad night's entertainment.
