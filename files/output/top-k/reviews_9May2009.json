Clearly the film is well liked for it's theme even though time travel is fantasy, still when blended with adventure and great sci-fi special effects Back to the Future is without a doubt a memorable classic.Directed by film master and genius Steven Spielberg along with special effects wizard Robert Zemeckis they helped make this film one of the most groundbreaking works of all-time. And the story is a catch even though mostly wrapped up in fantasy still the time travel plot sells to all of our hearts making us fall in love with the time travel fantasy. 1980's TV star Michael J. Fox(Family Ties)stars as teen Marty McFly a down on his luck and out of touch high school slacking teenager who's only hope of escape in his present day 1985 is his love of rock music and being buddies with his sidekick wild scientist Dr. Brown(Christopher Lloyd). Yet both feel history is about to change as Doc Brown has created a time machine inside his DeLorean car. Oddly this is groundbreaking yet both become mixed up in a time shattering chain reaction that could keep them stuck in the past with a vaporized future.Strangely they travel back to 1955 at a critical time when Marty's parents had yet to meet. During this time conflict and danger is abound as Marty has to be careful not to expose to much of his identity to his important past, because that is his critical future that he must protect from obstacles. In the past it was fun to see Marty having to force his parents to get together, and plus putting up with old high school bully Biff was entertaining and comical.Lessons learned from this movie is time travel though fun and interesting like seeing the past of your hometown and the fact that you would get to meet your parents before they conceived you would be great, still when facing the conflicts of identity exposure and dealing with past pest(Biff) and unexpected events would be very dangerous and risky. Still Back to the Future is now an immortalized pop culture film classic coming along in a time the mid 80's that showcased and interesting fantasy plot of time travel that filled our entertainment thirst.

Of course they were also teamed up with Optimus Prime and Megatron (but for some reason they always banded together to destroy my sisters doll house. lol, never mind). As a kid this movie was everything I wanted it to be . OK, I might have bin a bit disappointed that some of my favourite characters hadn't made the cut, but once I got into the movie I soon forgot all that, as I remember. When I was DVD shopping recently I came across it and got it for nostalgia sake. After not seeing it for a long time me and the family sat down to have a watch. Now my kids, being 6 and 9. Have never even heard of He-Man and my wife wasn't a huge fan as a kid. Now I will admit that, when watching it this time I wasn't as impressed as I was as a kid.

I think Frank Langella gave a very good performance as skeletor. I never realised, and couldn't believe it was him under all that make-up. I watched 'Superman Returns' not long after that.

Full Metal Jacket tries to cram in as much as possible to do with the Vietnam War, as it shoots from basic training; to graduation from that; to Vietnam itself; to the battlefield on which the film will conclude whatever documentation, rather than study, it has made. At the be all and end all of it, it's underwhelming at how all this ground and all this distance is covered with not much product at the pinnacle.There are scenes that you feel should work more than you feel they actually do. One such incidence involves a long take of the lead character walking down a muddied Vietnamese road with someone as tanks and trucks drive by beside them. The lead and the other soldier are talking about whereabouts and locations as they glance at a map of some kind. Your attention is drawn to the ongoing number of vehicles rolling on beside them, the dirt road acting as a metaphor for a conveyor belt as a continuous procession of troops are churned out and into their would-be doom as two human beings discuss the would-be whereabouts of a certain location. It captures the Vietnam War as a whole; a place in which a lot of fire power and lot of people kept getting rolled on into as those outranking them desperately tried to figure out what the Hell was going on and where the Hell everyone should be.People say the film is split into two 'parts', but it's not. It's actually one particular 'part', complete with characters and study that materialises into something else that just happens to be set elsewhere. Kubrick introduces his film; sets characters up and in true Hitchcockian style, kills off the one character that drives his opening third. But he is left wanting from there on in &#x96; with that one, distinct shot that kills a certain someone, I'm tempted to say that the film dies right there in that washroom along with said personnel. What is a pretty brutal, but I would think honestly portrayed, account of what it's like to become a United States Marine, shows various young, drafted Americans being trained to become killing machines for the world of war. But Kubrick is laying a rug under our feet and when the lead character decides it's journalism in which his beck-and-call lies, all this prior show and tell revolving around combat and 'what it's like to be a soldier' was really for not very much, as the lead branches out into another area of expertise. The rug is pulled away and people will say it's clever from Kubrick, I say it's cheating and just a little clumsy.Matthew Modine plays a certain Private Joker, 'Joker' being an alias he is given by his drill instructor Seargent Hartman (Ermey). The use of an alias and avoidance of use of Joker's real name attributes a certain ambiguity as to his identification, a renowned sense that everybody and anybody could 'represent' him as a character or as a real life person. The opening can be read into one of two ways; either you're going to find it a disturbing and very accurate look at the psychological effects of training for warfare or a series of 'fat' jokes that aren't particularly interesting. The fall guy is Leonard Lawrence (D'Onofrio), given the alias 'Private Pyle'. Pyle is the figure of ridicule throughout, with failings to accomplish the physical tasks the army demands consisting of the brunt of events in the opening hour. He is additionally a part of the film's one glaringly annoying scene during which the camera slowly zooms in on him pulling a would-be psychotic face as Hartman talks of Lee Harvey Oswald, himself an ex-marine, when he assassinated a certain person of a higher 'rank' than him. This foreshadows what is to come in regards to Pyle's own actions.The majority of what happens in Vietnam is just stuff strung together. Joker goes from one bombed out location to another; he meets someone he knew from his training; he gets into a daft egotistical confrontation with one of those big, bulky, clichéd soldiers who exist purely to maim the enemy and enjoy it (think Andy Serkis in Deathwatch). He'll engage in dialogue by some ancient ruins and pay sly reference as to how, deep down, all the people who survive Vietnam will miss it because a little piece of them will remain here given what an ordeal it really is &#x96; but it feels heartless and a little silly. Kubrick marks his finale with a lot of red tints and smatterings of loose flames here and there, burning up the scenery. It's an obvious visual representation of a decent into some sort of Hell as the final confrontation with a sniper is played out. But when people do get shot, Matthew Modine forgets to react and when other G.I.'s are downed by the Vietcong, there is no real reason to feel for them other than to remember that it really happened, thus I must feel bad for those that really suffered this fate. The film is actually quite a soulless exercise and from what I have seen, is Kubrick's worst work.

But Kubrick is laying a rug under our feet and when the lead character decides it's journalism in which his beck-and-call lies, all this prior show and tell revolving around combat and 'what it's like to be a soldier' was really for not very much, as the lead branches out into another area of expertise. The rug is pulled away and people will say it's clever from Kubrick, I say it's cheating and just a little clumsy.Matthew Modine plays a certain Private Joker, 'Joker' being an alias he is given by his drill instructor Seargent Hartman (Ermey). The use of an alias and avoidance of use of Joker's real name attributes a certain ambiguity as to his identification, a renowned sense that everybody and anybody could 'represent' him as a character or as a real life person. The opening can be read into one of two ways; either you're going to find it a disturbing and very accurate look at the psychological effects of training for warfare or a series of 'fat' jokes that aren't particularly interesting. The fall guy is Leonard Lawrence (D'Onofrio), given the alias 'Private Pyle'. Pyle is the figure of ridicule throughout, with failings to accomplish the physical tasks the army demands consisting of the brunt of events in the opening hour. He is additionally a part of the film's one glaringly annoying scene during which the camera slowly zooms in on him pulling a would-be psychotic face as Hartman talks of Lee Harvey Oswald, himself an ex-marine, when he assassinated a certain person of a higher 'rank' than him. This foreshadows what is to come in regards to Pyle's own actions.The majority of what happens in Vietnam is just stuff strung together. Joker goes from one bombed out location to another; he meets someone he knew from his training; he gets into a daft egotistical confrontation with one of those big, bulky, clichéd soldiers who exist purely to maim the enemy and enjoy it (think Andy Serkis in Deathwatch). He'll engage in dialogue by some ancient ruins and pay sly reference as to how, deep down, all the people who survive Vietnam will miss it because a little piece of them will remain here given what an ordeal it really is &#x96; but it feels heartless and a little silly. Kubrick marks his finale with a lot of red tints and smatterings of loose flames here and there, burning up the scenery. It's an obvious visual representation of a decent into some sort of Hell as the final confrontation with a sniper is played out. But when people do get shot, Matthew Modine forgets to react and when other G.I.'s are downed by the Vietcong, there is no real reason to feel for them other than to remember that it really happened, thus I must feel bad for those that really suffered this fate. The film is actually quite a soulless exercise and from what I have seen, is Kubrick's worst work.

Full Metal Jacket tries to cram in as much as possible to do with the Vietnam War, as it shoots from basic training; to graduation from that; to Vietnam itself; to the battlefield on which the film will conclude whatever documentation, rather than study, it has made. At the be all and end all of it, it's underwhelming at how all this ground and all this distance is covered with not much product at the pinnacle.There are scenes that you feel should work more than you feel they actually do. One such incidence involves a long take of the lead character walking down a muddied Vietnamese road with someone as tanks and trucks drive by beside them. The lead and the other soldier are talking about whereabouts and locations as they glance at a map of some kind. Your attention is drawn to the ongoing number of vehicles rolling on beside them, the dirt road acting as a metaphor for a conveyor belt as a continuous procession of troops are churned out and into their would-be doom as two human beings discuss the would-be whereabouts of a certain location. It captures the Vietnam War as a whole; a place in which a lot of fire power and lot of people kept getting rolled on into as those outranking them desperately tried to figure out what the Hell was going on and where the Hell everyone should be.People say the film is split into two 'parts', but it's not. It's actually one particular 'part', complete with characters and study that materialises into something else that just happens to be set elsewhere. Kubrick introduces his film; sets characters up and in true Hitchcockian style, kills off the one character that drives his opening third. But he is left wanting from there on in &#x96; with that one, distinct shot that kills a certain someone, I'm tempted to say that the film dies right there in that washroom along with said personnel.

There are no heroes, no legendary feats in this movie, it's no band of brothers, it's a Kubrick film. And it's a fantastic one. Kubrick never did in complex scenarios, the plot in this movie, is simple, a group young Americans being trained to join the marines forms the first part, which to me is the main one. You can see Kubrick's work at its best in that first part. Seargeant Instructor Hartman, what a character! He is in your face from the first minute of the film, and those scenes at the camp were wonderfully shot. Close ups to bank on actors' performances and add intensity to the scenes, and intense they were. The humiliating and degrading treatment imposed by the Sergeant Instructor to the whole group, especially to Pvt Pyle, is frightening. The star performer in that first part to me has got to be Pvt Pyle. The scenes are shot in a succession of defining events, so that your eyes are scotched to the screen.The second part takes place in Vietnam, a Vietnam ravaged by war. Now I have to admit here that there have been better war movies shot in the heat of battle if you are looking for spectacular, rapid, grandiose fighting. Apocalypse Now would be a superb example. But here Kubrick, offers a more intimate view of fighting and always keeps it simple but pleasing on the eye. Many will say that the first part is of higher quality than the second, it could be true. But I think that the second part had to be shot in this way, nothing too over the top, a plot so simple and intense, so that it is difficult to forget.

But the films treating the subject of Vietnam war will be rarer and rarer, Apocalypse Now, Platoon and Full Metal Jacket are the best three films on Vietnam war.

Perhaps this is due to the fact that no one could make it as intense or thrilling as the Master of Suspense himself, Alfred Hitchcock.After a string of successes in Hollywood, including the Oscar-winning Rebecca, Suspicion, and Saboteur, Hitchcock really began to branch out and make projects that I believe foreshadow the imminent success he would have in the 1950s. While this may not have been one of his most successful or memorable films, it is in my mind the first one dealing with a rather grim subject, more so than his previous films, and it also shows his immense talent in setting up the audience for a devastating climax. Here, Hitchcock had a tremendous cast to work with as well as being able to shoot on-site in a small suburban California town.Teresa Wright gives a quirky and solid performance as the oldest daughter and the most idealistic, named Charlie after her uncle Charlie, the suspected murderer played so brilliantly by one of the most underrated actors of all time, Joseph Cotten. Cotten, best known for working with Orson Welles, completely changes his on-screen persona and creates a very disturbing and memorable character. There are some deftly touches from Hitchcock that show the special bond these two have and has Charlie's suspicions rise about her uncle, we can see that connection manifest itself even more. My one tiny complaint is that of the detective character who seemingly falls in love with the young Charlie, which to me didn't fit the tone or realism of the story.In short, this is one of Hitchcock's very best, on par with his run of masterpieces in the late 1950s. He uses the great cast and writing and traps us in the story with the characters in this innocent little town that has to deal with a very big presence that is overshadowing them all.

There are some deftly touches from Hitchcock that show the special bond these two have and has Charlie's suspicions rise about her uncle, we can see that connection manifest itself even more. My one tiny complaint is that of the detective character who seemingly falls in love with the young Charlie, which to me didn't fit the tone or realism of the story.In short, this is one of Hitchcock's very best, on par with his run of masterpieces in the late 1950s. He uses the great cast and writing and traps us in the story with the characters in this innocent little town that has to deal with a very big presence that is overshadowing them all. And all the young Charlie needs to suspect her uncle is a shadow of a doubt.

Especially those who think Sean Connery is the best and only man whoever should have played 007.Certainly the most dangerous opponent Bond ever faced was Odd Job, who was Auric Goldfinger's bodyguard and all around assassin. I believe he was the most dangerous opponent James Bond ever fought with in all of his films. Watch that fight scene that Harold Sakata had with Sean Connery, he's got Connery almost down for the count. Fighting skills can only carry you so far when your opponent outweighs you and is built like a brick outhouse. In fact it's only sheer trickery in which Connery overcomes Sakata in a shocking conclusion.As for Gert Frobe who was Goldfinger he's the ultimate Bond villain with the ultimate plan. He's even got his men fooled who think they're going to rob Fort Knox so he can corner the world's gold supply. Actually Goldfinger plans to blow up Fort Knox with an atomic bomb and then he'll really corner the market. Of course it's up to 007 to stop him.The Bond girls are more luscious than ever with two of them, Shirley Eaton and Tania Millet meeting their demise. Eaton was the famous golden girl who Goldfinger suffocated by painting her entire body with gold paint. And of course there's Honor Blackman who switched sides do to the charms of James Bond. Who can ever forget a character name like Pussy Galore.I well remember when Goldfinger was released in 1964 just in time for the presidential campaign. The Republican candidate was Barry Goldwater that year for you young people, not alive at the time. Poor Barry was busy defending himself from charges that he would scrap Social Security, sell the Tennessee Valley Authority and lob one into the men's room at the Kremlin. So all he needed was a film to come out with a master villain with a name so similar. The Democrats had a field day spoofing the title song that Shirley Bassey made such a hit from.Without the Goldwater reference, Goldfinger is still a great action film, one of the best of Bond.

Much more than just a setting and type of action, they are a bundle of conventions, moods and character types. If you're going to mess with a genre, you need to get it dead right or you'll be making a flop. In 1952 the Western was at the height of its popularity, but nothing survives without adapting, and Westerns were either becoming bigger and bolder, or like High Noon they were overturning those rules.To understand why High Noon is what it is, you have to bear in mind that writer Carl Foreman, producer Stanley Kramer and director Fred Zinnemann were quite innocently approaching the genre not because they thought it would be fun to make a Western, but because it was an ideal setting for the kind of story they wanted to tell. These three had collaborated before on The Men, an extremely earnest yet rather flawed picture. High Noon is like their graduation piece.From the very first scenes you can tell this is going to be somewhat different from your average horse opera. Zinnemann, as always, shoots the outdoors with an emphasis on beauty and simplicity. This contrasts with the extremely dark and cramped looking interiors. Funnily enough (or perhaps not), Western director supreme John Ford also used a firm contrast between indoors and outdoors, but it was done in a different way and for different reasons. In Ford's west, the interiors were cosy homesteads, whereas the open plain was romantic, exciting and slightly dangerous. In High Noon however the point seems be to show the townspeople shuttered up in their homes, peering out onto the action. The reason for using light, airy exteriors is less obvious, and at first glance it even seems contradictory to have the villains delicately framed amid the trees. It does however give us as audience members a sense of injustice that these thugs should be roaming free amongst all this beauty.Those iconic opening shots also establish right away the sense of dynamic rhythm, and this is integral to making High Noon enjoyable. The picture is shot and edited in a way that is fairly commonplace now (thanks to a generation of filmmakers who grew up hero-worshipping Orson Welles) but was pretty cutting edge for the time. Little bursts of action begin and end almost every scene, so that the pace is continuous, and we feel that the picture is constantly moving forward. All this leads to a finale of a good old-fashioned tension-building montage, one which is particularly effective thanks to its motifs of the clock, railroad track and empty chair having been prominently established throughout the picture.The rhythm and tone of High Noon is enhanced by what is one of the best examples of motion picture scoring of the era. One of the biggest problems with many films of the 40s and 50s is overblown, overly melodramatic background music, which often detracts from the power of the performances and overshadows the action. All Dimitri Tiomkin's score for High Noon does is establish a mood for each scene, adding atmosphere to the action. It also happens to be incredibly melodic and listenable, and I for one disagree with the notion that a great backing score is one you don't notice.Last but not least, High Noon happens to be superbly acted on all parts. Gary Cooper was not the deepest or most flexible actor ever, but once in a while a part came along that fit his style like a glove, and this is probably his best. Like Cooper, all of the supporting cast underplay it, moving little but conveying emotional depths with subtle gestures and expressions. This understated tone is ideal for the overall feel and pace, and there is no weak link in it, ranging as it does from the suppressed temper of Katy Jurado to the mute moodiness of Lee van Cleef.Ultimately though the only real problem with High Noon is that its creators did not have any real reverence or understanding for the Western genre. They saw it merely as a setting for a story. Compare this to Shane, which is in a way more of an anti-Western because it sets out to debunk the myths of the genre, but it also tips its hat to the conventions of the Westerns, and has respect for its character types. This is why people like Howard Hawks and John Wayne were so appalled by High Noon. Nevertheless it is a resonant and tightly constructed thriller, and this is what has earned it admiration over the years.

The truth is that while such movies are good in their own right because they allow you to escape into a world of fantasy, the movies are misleading because war is nothing like what is shown in them. You do not survive a war because you have muscles which you can flex. You do not survive a war because you are more skilled than the other. Those are the days of ancient warfare when you would fight with swords. But modern warfare is all about luck. You survive only if you are lucky that of all the thousands of bullets and debris flying around, not one strikes you or even if it does, it strikes you in a way that it does not kill you. Nobody goes into a war without fear. Nobody remembers a country when fighting a war. All that matters is survival - survival at all costs. And that is the true picture of war that Saving Private Ryan manages to show so beautifully.The movie opens with a very brutal war sequence based on the Ohama beach war. It is difficult to imagine how the movie makers managed to plan the filming of this entire sequence. It is so realistic and will forever dispel the notions of any exuberant youth who thinks that war is glamorous. There is nothing glamorous about war and there never ever will be. I have heard rumors from my friends that some people vomited in the cinema hall due the extent of violence portrayed in this movie. And so I must warn you that if you are someone who is easily affected by blood and gore, pray do not watch this movie or at least this sequence.Spielberg along with the rest of the crew does a stupendous and a beautiful job of showing a rescue mission that leads the leading group into the heart of war to rescue one man - Private Ryan who has already lost three of his brothers to the World War operations. An order has come in from top authorities to extradite the last of the four brothers. How does the team assigned feel about it? Needless to say, they are grumbling about it but as we should know, a solider is nothing but like a pawn in a game of chess the moves of which are determined by people far from any pain and without any proper understanding of how painful war is in reality.For any person, this movie is a must-watch. It is a must-watch for many reasons. You must watch it because it will remind you of what the world has seen in World War II.

You do not survive a war because you have muscles which you can flex. You do not survive a war because you are more skilled than the other. Those are the days of ancient warfare when you would fight with swords. But modern warfare is all about luck.

Nobody goes into a war without fear. Nobody remembers a country when fighting a war. All that matters is survival - survival at all costs. And that is the true picture of war that Saving Private Ryan manages to show so beautifully.The movie opens with a very brutal war sequence based on the Ohama beach war. It is difficult to imagine how the movie makers managed to plan the filming of this entire sequence.

I have heard rumors from my friends that some people vomited in the cinema hall due the extent of violence portrayed in this movie. And so I must warn you that if you are someone who is easily affected by blood and gore, pray do not watch this movie or at least this sequence.Spielberg along with the rest of the crew does a stupendous and a beautiful job of showing a rescue mission that leads the leading group into the heart of war to rescue one man - Private Ryan who has already lost three of his brothers to the World War operations. An order has come in from top authorities to extradite the last of the four brothers. How does the team assigned feel about it? Needless to say, they are grumbling about it but as we should know, a solider is nothing but like a pawn in a game of chess the moves of which are determined by people far from any pain and without any proper understanding of how painful war is in reality.For any person, this movie is a must-watch. It is a must-watch for many reasons. You must watch it because it will remind you of what the world has seen in World War II.

I've seen this movie dozens of times, and really enjoyed its sequels (aside from part 2, a la 'Indiana Jones 2.') This absolute classic set all the standards, or in better terms, clichés. So, if you watch this today, you might recognize a lot of the scenes, dialogue, surprises, but real die hard fans will see this started it all. Much like 'Halloween' really was the birth of the slasher film (others will dispute, but it really was Michael Myers that started the trends.) Unfortunately for the copy-cats, 'Die Hard' had an excellent villain (Rickman) and supporting cast. In addition, and most importantly, it had Bruce Willis who was, I've read, the bottom of the barrel choice of the producers and yet, contributed the most depth of ANY HERO of these 'Die Hard' rip offs. He had great lines, depth, realistic approach, was vulnerable, and simply human. As stated, despite its flaws (the white-to-green wife beater was solely a distraction and the fact two main characters seemed to just ride off in the sunset &#x96; yes, it was part of the storyline, but surely unrealistic to the rest of the it could really happen plot) 'Die Hard' was nearly perfect, and this was thanks to nearly perfect performances from Rickman and Willis. Not to mention the continuous and great action sequences. Basically, on Christmas Eve, Willis flies into LA from NYC to make good with wife only to help hostages during a heist. Only thing I would've done differently in Willis' role was, when he had the police on the secret radio, was to threatened the President. I'm sure that would've brought more than just the police.

I feel I'm in no position to argue. With that said this delightful comedy has a little something for everyone to enjoy.After being nearly arrested for entertaining in an illegal backdoor dive and gambling club two musicians named Joe and Jerry, played by Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon, flee the scene and quickly start looking for jobs elsewhere. After hearing that a certain opening is available for a saxaphone and bull fiddle player Jerry tries to convince an agent that he and Joe can qualify for the engagement -- the only catch is that they have to be women. Joe refuses the idea and suggests the alternative and play at a dance located 100 miles out-of-town. In an effort to provide themselves with transportation Joe charms his way with a woman to borrow her car located at a parking garage. While there Joe and Jerry witness a mob massacre; narrowly escaping death themselves. In fear of their lives the two flee the state, joining an all-girl band masquerading as women and head out by bus to Florida.During this bus ride the two men encounter an attractive blonde named Sugar Kane Kowalczyk, played by a voluptuous, then pregnant Marilyn Monroe. From the very first meeting she comes across as a not particularly bright, bottle-sipping ukulele player who wants nothing more but to marry a nice, kind man with lots of money -- like a millionaire with glasses. As the story progresses Joe takes a fancy to Sugar and funny complications ensue. The band eventually arrive in Florida, and Joe and Jerry, now calling themselves Josephine and Daphne, instead of fleeing on arrival decide to play out their stint at a hotel lounge. Meanwhile, Joe attempts to win the affection of Sugar while pretending to be an English millionaire equipped with glasses and a yacht. But their amusing absurdities come to a halt when the mob from Chicago, headed by Spats Colombo (George Raft), catches up with them by odd chance at the same hotel.There are two reasons why Some Like It Hot works and why so few of the same kind of movies that followed have been a success. 1) The cast.

The two men play off each other so well and they're a delight to watch.
