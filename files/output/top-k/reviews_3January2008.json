The film also stars Monica Potter, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Bob Gunton and Harve Presnell. Richard Kiley has a small role at the end.Patch Adams is a young man who, after his own experiences in a mental hospital, wants to help others by connecting with them as people and employing laughter. He starts medical school and is dismayed to find out that students have no exposure to patients until the third year. He starts entertaining the children in the cancer clinic, reaching out to an angry man with cancer, and eventually starts a small clinic with the help of friends, including fellow students. One student, Corinne (Potter), is a cold fish, but eventually takes to Patch and his methods, and helps him in his work. Meanwhile, back in medical school, the head of the institution (Gunton) wants him out.This is a highly sentimental film that will not be for everyone. It's very old-fashioned not only in its message but in the Frank Capraesque way it's done. That being said, I really liked it, and I loved Williams' warmth in the role of Patch. Though a true story, its theme of a passionate man going up against the establishment is a familiar one, but there's nothing much new under the sun - it's the execution that makes it or breaks it. It's a wonderful film. By the way, I still think Monica Potter is Julia Roberts with a blond wig.

The acting, the script, the direction, the way Clemenza drops those sausages in the sauce, the climatic baptism\/blood bath -- everything about it is brilliant. Undisputed. Now, imagine everything in a film is made to be bad -- sets, costumes, acting, lines ... Campy, 6-year-old imagination bad. That's Flash Gordon ... the greatest bad movie of all time. It's as brilliant, and as a religious a cinematic experience as watching Godfather. I just saw this gem again last week on DVD, and Lord, it's spectacular. Sam Jones is as bad an actor as Al Pacino is good. But, he's brilliant here, because Flash is supposed to be a clueless hero -- a football star tossed into a sci-fi intergalactic war that he can barely comprehend. He has his name written on his shirt for crying out loud. FLASH in big red letters against a white T-shirt. As if he'd forget his name if he didn't look down to his chest. And darn if Sam Jones doesn't look like he hasn't a clue what the heck is going on. Max Von Sydow is the evil Ming the Merciless. Dig the name. Dig his outfit. Dig that performance, he's an evil Christ with the mind of a 12-year-old who just discovered girls and morality. Add in Topol If I Were a Rich Man and Grade-Z Margot Kidder clone Melody Anderson as the girlfriend-babe Dale Arden, and ... oh, it's brilliant. Queen provides the over the top music score, singing of Flash as a Christ-like Savior of the Universe. Fred Mercury was a god, wasn't he? The film works on several levels. It's what every child imagines a comic book to look like if it were brought to life. Adults can have fun, too. It's a damn fine satire of law and marriage and live for adults, and religion and Communism and ..oh, just have fun. Some folks here say turn your brain off and enjoy. No! Turn your brain on and enjoy! Flash Gordon is a dream for heterosexuals, homosexuals .. the sexual references are endless. (The seduction-telepathic phone call scene is funnier and more out-there than anything I've sever seen. Tim Dalton's character protests against Flash ... a bit too much, maybe) Ming is impaled on a phallic-like rocket tip. The mythology is deep -- Robin Hood, Greek gods, etc, etc. It's trash, wonderful goofy, trash and I love every frame. For every kid who collected comic books, it's heaven. For every adult who wished he still collected comic books, it's heaven. Go ahead, watch the Godfather. I love it, it's brilliant. But it ain't fun. This is fun. This is Saturday-afternoon cinema at it's best, and it has the gumption to proudly be what Star Wars couldn't help but become ... junk. Wonderful, beautiful, enjoyable junk. I love this film. There hasn't been a finer comic book movie then or since.
