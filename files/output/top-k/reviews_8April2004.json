It focuses on the memorable, beautiful moments of life rather than the upsetting ones. You'll come to appreciate new and beautiful things - a dead bird on the ground, a rose petal or a paper bag dancing in the wind. With all these things making up the movie, it's obvious this Oscar winner has a beauty all its own, an unclassifiable and luminescent beauty more stunning than any amounts of cosmetics.--This movie has a star-studded cast and each major cast member is given an intriguing material and new heights of character development to work with. Our protagonist, Lester Burnham, played to Academy Award winning effect by Kevin Spacey, is a great leader for the movie. He brings one man dealing with his mid-life crisis in a different, self-esteem empowering way to the screen with utter grace and the character is constantly intriguing. Lester knows what he wants, goes for it, he's blunt and honest, with appreciation for the little things in life (his grandmother's hands, maple tree leaves) as well as a soft, caring side that just wants everybody to be OK. Lester's wife Carolyn is equally developed and multi-layered and brings both the more comedic and the more dramatic parts of the movie to life. Carolyn comes across as an uptight, bitch of a mother on first look but when her character is looked into she is really just a victim of 'stuff', the modern world, and has lost appreciation for things like flashing helicopters (great speech, Lester!). Annette Bening is marvellous as Carolyn, appropriately over-the-top in many scenes yet - if this makes sense - always bringing the most realistic scenes to the film, especially her crying and self-pitying, that was incredible to watch. The last member of the Burnham family, Jane, isn't as developed as her parents but the angry teenager aspect has rarely been done better and Thora Birch is Oscar-worthy. Next door there's the Fitts' - Ricky, Jane's boyfriend, who has a need to capture all the beauty in the world on tape and has a dark past. Ricky is one of the most enthralling characters in the film because of his attitudes towards people. He loves his father (Chris Cooper in an effective and overlooked role) but at the same time pities him for not being able to accept people for who and what they are. Their scenes together are emotionally charged and brutal, focusing on domestic violence and an intriguing father-son relationship. When all's said and done, these characters and actors are just so great because they're real. We can relate to them in some way or another, and the actors and beautiful writing really ensure this.--Sam Mendes did an excellent job of directing this movie. He added his own visual flair. I loved the cinematography and the use of roses and how shots were repeated to give that fantasy atmosphere. He is also always focused on the characters and how each of their arcs play out is consistently fascinating. To make a film entitled American Beauty and have it directed by a British man is rather a strange idea and not a risk that many would take. I'm so happy the producers and whatnot of this movie did, because it's hard to imagine any American director doing a better job.--In addition to having the British Mendes direct the movie, this is quite a risky film to make storyline wise. There's drug dealing, a middle-aged man fantasising graphically about sex with a teenager and - quite surprisingly - we're told at the very beginning that by the end of the film, Lester will be dead. It is astonishing then, that by the time the movie is over, you've forgotten that comment because you've just got so involved in the film and the death comes as a shock when it occurs. The drug dealing is standard stuff and not too bad as it is understandable and the fantasising-about-teenager-sex material is dealt with in a mature and responsible fashion, rather than being all yucky.THE BAD--Allison Janney's character in this film was quite fascinating. She was quiet and reserved, in addition to being a little strange. I don't think the material written for her was that special but Janney played it so perfectly that it was a disappointment she didn't get that much screen-time. Her character got a decent amount but I wanted more. This is probably the greedy side coming out of me, as I just didn't really want this movie to stop in the first place.--There are just a couple of cheesy moments where the 60's-esque dialogue is slightly overplayed. Lester saying I'm just an ordinary guy with nothing to lose is once such moment and another cheesy scene was when Ricky wrote JANE in fireworks. What on Earth was that all about?RATING10\/10 - I couldn't give any less to one of my favourite movies of all time. This artistic, memorable and beautiful film is truly unique and something special, a film to be seen and enjoyed by all.

Everything that ever happens in the movie, ever, has a realistic effect, but not to the cause that should have triggered it.  This helps you in several areas if you think about it this way.  Like how Derek goes to prison and comes out reformed.  He could have came out reformed but not by going through what his character went through.  It helps you because it speeds up time.  He needs to Learn hate, goto jail for 3 years, unlearn hate and help his brother. thats alot of ground to cover realisticly so we see this hyper reality.  More examples of cause and effects that don't match are.  What turns Derek racists, he could have turned racist, but not like that.  Theres are less potent effects also but they escape me at the moment as i am pressed for time.  Also because the causes don't match the effects you can see more clearly that his racism is all lies. I read once that someone thought this movie was great because you can actually believe some of Dereks rhetoric.  Well some of it is true but thats not what makes this a great movie.

They can enlighten us by giving us perspective and insight into people that we may recognize by name but yet know little of the circumstances that have made up the fabric of their lives.  And if the life they led is as fascinating as that of Loretta Lynn, they can also entertain us in the process.Based on Lynn's autobiographical novel of the same name, Coal Miner's Daughter is easily one of the best films of this genre.  It is the story of how Loretta Lynn became one of the most successful Country & Western vocalists in recording history despite having been raised in the poverty stricken hills of Butcher Holler, Kentucky, marrying at the age of 13, and having several children to boot.The first half of Coal Miner's Daughter is a fascinating look at a life foreign to most of us.  As the daughter of Ted Webb (Levon Helm) and Clara Webb (Phyllis Boyens), Loretta (Sissy Spacek)seems destined to live her life just as all who those who live in Butcher Holler eke out an existence.  It seems predetermined that she will probably marry one day, that her husband will be a coal miner just as her own father is, and she will have a caboodle of young 'uns running around the hills barefoot.  One day, on a trip into town with her father, Loretta meets the irrepressible Mooney Lynn (Tommy Lee Jones) who has just come home form the service.  It isn't long before Mooney convinces the 13 year. old Loretta that they are in love and need to be married.  After convincing Ted and Clara to give their blessing, the wedding takes place, and although it isn't apparent for many years, it's a decision that will forever alter the course of her existence.One of the reasons this film succeeds on the level that it does, is because Director Michael Apted never falls into the trap of making the film judgmental about many  of the events that occur in Loretta's life.  He let's the events of the film unfold naturally, and we either accept them for what they are or we don't.  For instance, many Directors would have felt the need to implant some nefarious motive behind Mooney's relationship with Loretta. The events that happen in Loretta's childhood were what they were, and though letting a child of thirteen marry may be foreign to us, it was obviously something that may not have been extraordinary unusual back in Butcher Holler.There is another reason why Coal Miner's Daughter succeeds on all levels. Sissy Spacek plays Loretta Lynn as if she were cloned from her.  Not only is their resemblance strikingly uncanny, her speaking voice, her singing voice, her mannerisms will have you believing that it is Loretta herself starring in this film.  As if this isn't enough, Spacek was required to play a character that starts out as a naive thirteen year old girl, and ends as an adult woman who suffers through many painful and tumultuous events in her life.  Not an easy task at all, but it is the stuff for which actresses win Academy Awards, and Spacek certainly earned hers.If Spacek's performance was exceptional, the rest of the cast would merely need to be adequate to make the film succeed, but they are every bit as impressive.  Given the difficult role of playing Mooney, Tommy Lee Jones brings the character to life.  While never making Mooney appear sympathetic, he does show us that Mooney is after all a human being, subject to the same foibles and temptations as the rest of us.  Most of all, despite his failings, Jones lets us know that Mooney did indeed care a great deal for Loretta, even if such outward expressions of love were foreign to him.There's more.  Levon Helm as Ted Webb gives one of the best supporting performance ever in a film.  As Ted, he gives us a father who cares deeply about his family, doing for them what he can with what little money he can scrape by on from his earning.  He is a man who has obviously been beaten down by the drudgery and day to day existence of spending most of his life with a pick and a shovel mining coal.  It is this existence that eventually forces Mooney into his decision to not become a victim of the coal mines.Last but certainly not least, is Beverly D'Angelo as Patsy Cline, who not only befriends Loretta, but helps to teach her the ways of the world.  Her performance is so good in fact, that although her scenes aren't many, D'Angelo leaves an indelible mark that made it difficult to accept Jessica Lange in the same role.  I do not know why Jones, Helm, and D'Angelo were not recognized when Awards time rolled around as they were all at least deserving of a nomination if not a win.  Perhaps Spacek's performance was so powerful that it overshadowed the fine work done by the rest of the cast. Then again, I quit trying to figure the reasoning behind awards a long time ago.There is no doubt however, that Coal Miner's Daughter is one of the best biographical films ever.  It is one of those rare times when cast, director, writer, all came together to make a very special film.  And when they all do that I have no choice but to give them my grade which for Coal Miner's Daughter is an A+.

One need only watch recent films such as Wrong Turn or the remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre to realize how far the horror genre has fallen.  Once John Carpenter made the first Halloween film, we have been subject to an endless series of copy cat films whose only purpose seems to be finding an imaginative way to slice and dice the local teenage population.  All of the Freddies, Jasons, and Michael Myers films combined don't come close to having an ounce of the entertainment and imagination of Producer Brian Yuzna and Director and Writer Stuart Gordon's Re-animator.Professor Herbert West (Jeffrey Combs) is a scientist who has discovered a formula which brings the dead back to life by reanimating their tissue. After an experiment in Switzerland goes awry, he moves to Miskatonic University to continue his experiments.  One thing Professor West isn't and that is modest.  He even takes a few moments to ridicule a professor, Dr. Carl Hill (David Gale) when he disagrees with him about when death actually occurs.  He eventually rents a room from fellow student Dan Cain (Bruce Abbot).  Dan is dating Megan Halsey  (Barbara Crampton) who is the daughter of the college dean, Alan Halsey (Robert Sampson).  What Dan doesn't know is that the aforementioned Dr. Hill has a perverted eye on Megan also.  We know this because of the sleazy stares Dr. Hill eyeballs her with when ever she's around.  Think of Megan as being an overage Lolita and Dr. Hill as Humbert Humbert and you've got the idea.  All of this is not window dressing as it would be in some other films.  It all comes into play very nicely.  It goes without saying that sooner or later, Dr. West will be making good use of his reanimation formula, in ways only those with the most grotesque sense of humor can imagine.  To say any more than that would deny you of the true pleasures of this film.How can a film that is so explicitly graphic and perverted in nature be fun? It's because every person involved in the making of Re-Animator was smart enough not to take it too seriously themselves.  Everything in this film is so wildly over the top, that you can't help but chuckle right along with them as they wink their eye at you.  There may be certain moments of the film that would normally sicken even the most hardcore horror film fanatic, but since Yuzna and Gordon never once let Re-animator sink into the tedious by the numbers game of other films of these nature, these same scenes become intentionally cartoonish and silly.But more than anything, this film owes it's life to it's cast.  Jeffrey Combs as Herbert West should serve as the model for anyone wanting to make a film involving a mad or semi-mad scientist.  Given this kind of role, there is many an actor who would have been tempted to ham it up and alas in many horror films they do just that.  However, when Combs seems to imply that he is the smartest man on the planet and the rest of us are Neanderthal, we don't hate him for this implication at all.  He is so good at making us believe he is the smartest man since Einstein and we are all nothing but Cro-magnon man by comparison that we love him for it just the same.  He may be crazy, but he's a fun kind of crazy.David Gale as the smarmy Dr. Hill, is a joy to watch also.  He has some of the most ridiculous scenes in the film yet somehow manages to keep a straight face through it all.  He gives new life to the old saying about not losing your head over a piece of tail.Bruce Abbot as Dan Cain is the perfect contrast for West.

All of the Freddies, Jasons, and Michael Myers films combined don't come close to having an ounce of the entertainment and imagination of Producer Brian Yuzna and Director and Writer Stuart Gordon's Re-animator.Professor Herbert West (Jeffrey Combs) is a scientist who has discovered a formula which brings the dead back to life by reanimating their tissue. After an experiment in Switzerland goes awry, he moves to Miskatonic University to continue his experiments.  One thing Professor West isn't and that is modest.  He even takes a few moments to ridicule a professor, Dr. Carl Hill (David Gale) when he disagrees with him about when death actually occurs.  He eventually rents a room from fellow student Dan Cain (Bruce Abbot).  Dan is dating Megan Halsey  (Barbara Crampton) who is the daughter of the college dean, Alan Halsey (Robert Sampson).  What Dan doesn't know is that the aforementioned Dr. Hill has a perverted eye on Megan also.  We know this because of the sleazy stares Dr. Hill eyeballs her with when ever she's around.  Think of Megan as being an overage Lolita and Dr. Hill as Humbert Humbert and you've got the idea.  All of this is not window dressing as it would be in some other films.  It all comes into play very nicely.  It goes without saying that sooner or later, Dr. West will be making good use of his reanimation formula, in ways only those with the most grotesque sense of humor can imagine.  To say any more than that would deny you of the true pleasures of this film.How can a film that is so explicitly graphic and perverted in nature be fun? It's because every person involved in the making of Re-Animator was smart enough not to take it too seriously themselves.  Everything in this film is so wildly over the top, that you can't help but chuckle right along with them as they wink their eye at you.  There may be certain moments of the film that would normally sicken even the most hardcore horror film fanatic, but since Yuzna and Gordon never once let Re-animator sink into the tedious by the numbers game of other films of these nature, these same scenes become intentionally cartoonish and silly.But more than anything, this film owes it's life to it's cast.  Jeffrey Combs as Herbert West should serve as the model for anyone wanting to make a film involving a mad or semi-mad scientist.  Given this kind of role, there is many an actor who would have been tempted to ham it up and alas in many horror films they do just that.  However, when Combs seems to imply that he is the smartest man on the planet and the rest of us are Neanderthal, we don't hate him for this implication at all.  He is so good at making us believe he is the smartest man since Einstein and we are all nothing but Cro-magnon man by comparison that we love him for it just the same.  He may be crazy, but he's a fun kind of crazy.David Gale as the smarmy Dr. Hill, is a joy to watch also.  He has some of the most ridiculous scenes in the film yet somehow manages to keep a straight face through it all.

Mike is the first to find out why when his interest in a girl suddenly lures him into a world of trouble with a clan of teen vampires lead by a guy named David (Sutherland).

They have to find out who the head vampire is before Mike, Star (Jami Garr), and Laddie (Corbitt) become full vampires. This is one fantastic movie as teenagers try to save the day from the cave-dwelling bloodsuckers.

Perhaps it is a better delusion, a more noble delusion, but a delusion nonetheless. The problem with delusions are you still aren't in touch with all of reality.  Delusions can also easily be taken away, as Hal's is.In the end, though, Hal comes to realize the whole _is_ greater than the some of the parts, and inner appearnace and outer appearance are still just parts.  Rosemary is a person with two main attributes a heroic and compassionate soul and an obese body.  Neither can truly be separated. Both together end up meaning more than either one, because Hal no longer needs some kind of filter to interpret reality.  He accepts reality as it is, spontaneously, without regret or the need to make it in any way different.In short, his awareness of reality is finally totally integrated.  He was mentally unhealthy when he only liked pretty people.  He had made great strides toward being healed as he saw only inner beauty.  But only when he could take reality as an undivided totality, did he finally breakthrough to true mental health.Despite the above sounding like this is some kind of heavily existential film with lots of allusions to gestalt psychology, all this peals forth in a film that is screamingly funny at times, incredibly touching at others.The performances are all magnificent.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"},{"date":"8 April 2004","score":"65 out of 85 people found the following review useful","review":"  Over one century ago (1897 to be exact) in the dingy back streets of Montmartre, Paris, an eccentric ex-secretary to a Police commissioner named Oscar Metenier, opened the Theatre du Grand Guignol. For 65 years, groups of performers staged one-act plays that depicted graphic scenes of murder, mutilation and torture. Famous works by authors such as Charles Dickens and James Hadley Chase were adapted for Grand Guignol and made into, some might say, horrific gore-laden masterpieces. People's morbid curiosities kept the shows ever popular, all the way up until the Nazis invaded France during World War II. Perhaps because the French population was experiencing true horrors of their own, the urge to see such events portrayed on stage, quite obviously became a lot less alluring. The theatre never recovered, and it finally closed its doors for the last time in 1962. William Lustig's Maniac is basically Grand Guignol for the cinematic audiences of the eighties. A movie that viewers of a quainter disposition will describe as depraved, demoralising and redundantly mean spirited, while others have touted its story telling as artistic, ballsy and daring. Although its often labelled as a formulaic stalk and slash offering, it is actually a member of the sub, sub-genre that differentiates itself from the Halloween and Friday the 13th created format. Along with Nightmares in a Damaged Brain, Mardi Gras Massacre, and Don't go in the House; Maniac offers something refreshing, by giving the killer characterisation and making him more than just a loony in a mask with a machete.The plot portrays the life of Frank Zito, an insane and stammering psychological mess of a man, with more than a few severe problems upstairs. His story unravels around his decent into madness, which stems from his seclusion and isolation from the outside world. He is a lonely, redoubtable character, with no friends or companionship; he's just alone with his fragmented mind to torment him. His desperation to feel accepted by civilisation results in him creating his own 'family' from female mannequins. To add realism to their beings and to make them as human-like as could be possible, he furnishes their heads with the scalps of women that he butchers remorselessly. In the first ten minutes, an unfortunate prostitute is ruthlessly slaughtered for no apparent reason, and the misogyny continues all the way through the movie; as nurses, models and innocent bystanders are gorily slain for nothing more than the misfortune of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. The creepiest thing about these murders, is the fact that Zito has no apparent understanding of the results of his actions. He reads headlines, which describe the feelings of a city left in fear by his spate of madness and he watches news updates that inform us of the aftermath of his bloodthirsty rein. But his reaction is non-existent; he shows no knowledge of any wrongdoing, almost like he is unaware that he commits such atrocities. His mental downfall takes a U-turn, when he meets up with Anna D'Antoni (Caroline Munro) a photographer that attracts his attention for the first time when she snaps him wondering through a park. We finally get to see a thoroughly different side to his character, - a romantic, insecure personality that's been buried beneath years of self-inflicted misery and emotional torture. There is a constant battle between two separate personalities that rages inside Zito's mind however, and Anna's fate depends upon whether the good or evil side emerges victoriously...The opening sequence stays true to its stalk and slash counterparts; as the masked, heavy breathing Zito kills a loving couple on a beach. Lustig describes the scene as a homage to Jaws, only this time the monster is out of the sea and on land, thus explaining the beach setting. It's a well-handled commencement, with Savini adding the magic that he is most reputed for; and Robert Lindsay's competent photography creates energy that prevails throughout the whole movie. Although body count material is introduced without any characterisation or development, it can be argued that the story resolves around Zito; and to him, victims are only objects or playthings anyway. I have always considered Bill Lustig to be a highly underrated filmmaker. Maniac Cop was yet another great movie, although I would consider this to be one of his best - probably because he was relatively unknown when he worked it. The parts that were filmed inside the killer's flat are shot in complete silence, which effectively adds to the feeling of seclusion and abandonment. It's like the viewer is inside the character's apartment, but also inside his own remote world, where his loneliness has degenerated into an unrelenting insanity. It's added moments like these that make Maniac all the more creepy. The subway scene adds some awe-inspiring suspense, as Frank stalks a nurse through the station. Lustig does well to keep the atmosphere tense and the viewer is always aware that something is about to happen, meaning there is never any allowance for comfort in the fact that any of the characters will escape to safety. He also manages at least two effective jump-scares, the final Carrie-esque jolt being particularly memorable. Jay Chattaway provides a superb score to accompany the visuals, and Lorenzo Marinelli's editing is equally impressive.Although you could never call Joe Spinnell a fantastic dramatic performer by any of his pre-Maniac work, Frank Zito (named as a nod to Joseph Zito the director of The Prowler and friend to Lustig and Savini) was undoubtedly the part he was put on this planet to play. It's a convincing performance that allowed the actor to immerse himself deep into something that he had researched thoroughly and accurately, giving his character a vivid portrait of realism that was necessary to create the child's nightmare-like quality that the movie possesses. Spinnell is Maniac and Maniac is Spinnell, there's no doubt about it; it was his signature role. It's impossible to imagine another character actor fitting the bill so perfectly. Not only does he play the part; he also looks and sounds it too. He wasn't the only one that hit a career high under Lustig's direction though; the ever-adorable Caroline Munro gave her most realistic portrayal too. Her star had just reached its zenith in 1980, before she became a scream queen in less memorable flicks such as Slaughter High and Faceless, which would supplement her income, well into motherhood. This also offered a chance to break away from the bikini-clad bimbo roles that she had been given up until that point; and it gave her the chance to try something a little different. I strongly respect her refusal to do any nudity, which cost a further contract with Hammer in the early seventies. It takes a strong women to reject such offers for the sake of her modesty, and Munro proved that she was just that; and her career strengthened because of it. It's worth noting that the pair were reunited two years later for Fanatic (aka The Last Horror Film), which lacked the gritty edge and invitingly sleazy surroundings of its predecessor, but attempted to cash-in on the fame that Lustig's film had earned from its gruesome reputation.Maniac was filmed on super 16 mm and like the best slashers from this period, it was shot for the most miniscule of budgets ('under a million dollars'). A lot of the on-location work was staged illegally, without any insurance or authorised permission. Lustig anecdotes about the exploding head scene (no less than Tom Savini's, by the way), where they had to fire a shotgun through the windscreen of a car and then make a quick getaway, before the Police arrived to investigate the gunshot! Munro was given only one-day to rehearse the script before starting work, due to replacing Dario Argento's wife of the time, Daria Nicolodi. Admittedly, it does seem pretty strange that a woman with a name as Italian as Anna D' Antoni, would be played by an English Rose; but she does a good enough job and is truly a sight to behold. Many, MANY countries rejected this movie on the grounds of its unnecessary violence towards women; including the censors here in the UK, who made sure to add it to the DPP list almost immediately. The Philippines' board of film review was so outraged by what they discovered that they told the producers to take it to Satan instead of their country, and went on to describe it as 'unentertaining' and 'unfit for Human consumption'! Of course, knowledge of those monstrosities, only made it seem all the more curious to youngsters that had heard such tales of unruly degradation, and were eager to check it out for themselves; thus earning it a massive cult following. Upon release, it became immensely popular, although it was heavily criticised for its brutal violence. Spinnell said that the blood was never on screen long enough for his creation to be considered too gruesome. He lied; - there are parts of the movie that are limitlessly gory and blood-soaked. You'll find decapitations scalpings and dismemberment, - if you can name a gory way to slaughter a female, then you'll find it somewhere in here. Maniac is one of the only video-nasties that have managed to retain its shock factor, even after twenty-four years!I saw an edited copy of this in the mid-nineties and was unimpressed. Perhaps my attentions were elsewhere or I was expecting something more? I can't be sure, but last night, watching it once again for this review, I found myself captivated. There are flaws, yes for certain. It's unlikely that a beauty as striking, as Anna would give the time of day to a misfit like Zito in the first place, and the end sequence is a little bizarre to say the least. But all niggles are forgiven when you acknowledge the effort that has been put into making this production as realistically as they possibly could. Credit has to be given to Spinnell for believing in the project and his dedication and research into serial killers deserves recognition. I haven't yet seen Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer, although I'm told that the two movies have a great deal in common, so I'm after a copy right now. Maniac has earned itself another fan, and I believe that it deserves to be seen. There has never been, and probably never will be, another movie so depraved and disturbing; so grab a copy whilst you've got the chance. It's an innovative and daring take on the standard slasher genre, which succeeds because it is just that.

He also manages at least two effective jump-scares, the final Carrie-esque jolt being particularly memorable. Jay Chattaway provides a superb score to accompany the visuals, and Lorenzo Marinelli's editing is equally impressive.Although you could never call Joe Spinnell a fantastic dramatic performer by any of his pre-Maniac work, Frank Zito (named as a nod to Joseph Zito the director of The Prowler and friend to Lustig and Savini) was undoubtedly the part he was put on this planet to play. It's a convincing performance that allowed the actor to immerse himself deep into something that he had researched thoroughly and accurately, giving his character a vivid portrait of realism that was necessary to create the child's nightmare-like quality that the movie possesses. Spinnell is Maniac and Maniac is Spinnell, there's no doubt about it; it was his signature role. It's impossible to imagine another character actor fitting the bill so perfectly. Not only does he play the part; he also looks and sounds it too. He wasn't the only one that hit a career high under Lustig's direction though; the ever-adorable Caroline Munro gave her most realistic portrayal too. Her star had just reached its zenith in 1980, before she became a scream queen in less memorable flicks such as Slaughter High and Faceless, which would supplement her income, well into motherhood. This also offered a chance to break away from the bikini-clad bimbo roles that she had been given up until that point; and it gave her the chance to try something a little different. I strongly respect her refusal to do any nudity, which cost a further contract with Hammer in the early seventies. It takes a strong women to reject such offers for the sake of her modesty, and Munro proved that she was just that; and her career strengthened because of it. It's worth noting that the pair were reunited two years later for Fanatic (aka The Last Horror Film), which lacked the gritty edge and invitingly sleazy surroundings of its predecessor, but attempted to cash-in on the fame that Lustig's film had earned from its gruesome reputation.Maniac was filmed on super 16 mm and like the best slashers from this period, it was shot for the most miniscule of budgets ('under a million dollars'). A lot of the on-location work was staged illegally, without any insurance or authorised permission. Lustig anecdotes about the exploding head scene (no less than Tom Savini's, by the way), where they had to fire a shotgun through the windscreen of a car and then make a quick getaway, before the Police arrived to investigate the gunshot! Munro was given only one-day to rehearse the script before starting work, due to replacing Dario Argento's wife of the time, Daria Nicolodi. Admittedly, it does seem pretty strange that a woman with a name as Italian as Anna D' Antoni, would be played by an English Rose; but she does a good enough job and is truly a sight to behold. Many, MANY countries rejected this movie on the grounds of its unnecessary violence towards women; including the censors here in the UK, who made sure to add it to the DPP list almost immediately. The Philippines' board of film review was so outraged by what they discovered that they told the producers to take it to Satan instead of their country, and went on to describe it as 'unentertaining' and 'unfit for Human consumption'! Of course, knowledge of those monstrosities, only made it seem all the more curious to youngsters that had heard such tales of unruly degradation, and were eager to check it out for themselves; thus earning it a massive cult following. Upon release, it became immensely popular, although it was heavily criticised for its brutal violence. Spinnell said that the blood was never on screen long enough for his creation to be considered too gruesome. He lied; - there are parts of the movie that are limitlessly gory and blood-soaked. You'll find decapitations scalpings and dismemberment, - if you can name a gory way to slaughter a female, then you'll find it somewhere in here. Maniac is one of the only video-nasties that have managed to retain its shock factor, even after twenty-four years!I saw an edited copy of this in the mid-nineties and was unimpressed. Perhaps my attentions were elsewhere or I was expecting something more? I can't be sure, but last night, watching it once again for this review, I found myself captivated. There are flaws, yes for certain. It's unlikely that a beauty as striking, as Anna would give the time of day to a misfit like Zito in the first place, and the end sequence is a little bizarre to say the least. But all niggles are forgiven when you acknowledge the effort that has been put into making this production as realistically as they possibly could. Credit has to be given to Spinnell for believing in the project and his dedication and research into serial killers deserves recognition. I haven't yet seen Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer, although I'm told that the two movies have a great deal in common, so I'm after a copy right now. Maniac has earned itself another fan, and I believe that it deserves to be seen. There has never been, and probably never will be, another movie so depraved and disturbing; so grab a copy whilst you've got the chance. It's an innovative and daring take on the standard slasher genre, which succeeds because it is just that.

Bob drives an American V 8 convertible through Paris, the police rides a 15 CV and out of every bar one can hear some different music. And Henri Decae is the lighting cameraman as in most Melville pictures,  and he just pulls the trigger of his hand camera to catch the nightly beauty and morbidity of the Picalle area.One night Bob is eventually totally broke and starts to plan a hold - up at the Casino of Deauville. He gathers a group of specialists (you can bring guns, but we don't use them) and being broke &#150; has to hire the money for the preliminary expenses from wealthy Howard Vernon (wearing obviously a false moustache and being almost a star in the fifties and the first leading character in Melvilles Film of 1947, Le Silence de la Mer ). Well, the inspector gets a hint because Paulo cant keep his mouth shut and wants to impress Anne, who doesn't love him at all, and stupid as she is tells the plan Marc. And it is the wife of the croupier, who tells the plan anonymously to the inspector. Many years ago Bob has saved the inspectors life, so the inspector runs around places to find Bob to tell him to stay away from the Deauville job. But the warning is too late. The action is supposed to start at 3 O'clock in the morning. To kill the time Bob is at the roulette and baccara tables, of cause starts to gamble and eventually blows up the bank and is late for the hold up. His beautifully prepared hold-up becomes completely unnecessary because he has just won the eight hundred millions in the Casino vaults by legal means.  Paulo is shot dead by the police. Like a waiter the casino boy brings the money after the handcuffed Bob, who mentions to his friend the inspector, that he hopes that the money is safe with them....Actually a comedy, not very light hearted thou, and only because of the ending. A fine black and white picture (made with very little money) with one black man at the piano, all the rest are people between night and day between a thing called love and making somehow a living. It is a rather cool picture, a love letter to Paris; no fast actions; there is only one outburst of hate, when Paulo shoots Marc, to stop him to tell the inspector about the Deauville Raid. You can see nice details from the time one is missing for over forty years now, for instance the small 4 door Renault with the engine in the rear and the doors opening the wrong way.

People know what they are and they know what they are going to get when they rushed to the theater to see it or watch it now. They obviously liked the way it was and the simple, mindless fun it delivered, because if they didn't, then the movies would not of been as successful or popular as they were, or had so many made. I definitley know many scholary people who enjoy movies like this because they are fun and innocent and let you have a fun side. It's alright to like PA and any of it's sequels.  ","genre":"Comedy"}]
