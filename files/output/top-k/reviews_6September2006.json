In spite of these misgivings I actually felt pleasure watching the film. The actress who portrayed Clarissa Dalloway young, Natacha something-or-other, had subliminal beauty which reminded me of the great actresses of the 1940's, something you very rarely see nowadays, and I have always liked a great deal Michael Kitchen every time I have seen him in a film. I would therefore recommend the film to all those who like period pieces but would warn that the plot is rather tame and subdued and that if you are looking for passion, sex and romance you might be left disappointed, or at least hungering for more, especially as the ending is rather flat and unoriginal.

Firstly, it's not a great film, so if you demand 9\/10 from a movie then this isn't for you. Also, although baseball is a very interesting sport to some, the great majority (particularly outside the US) just don't get it and are not interested in the sport. This undoubtedly will have an affect on some viewers' enjoyment of the film, although you could apply the psychology of it to any sport; it's just that a lot of people would need it to be based on a sport that they enjoy. Fair enough...Bad bits The part that Ellen Barkin plays is totally pointless and the film would be better without her. There are a few characters that are slightly annoying because they're playing into steretypes. The way the lead characters drive around in huge SUV's seems to be spot-on though and quite believable, although you have to question just how much Robert DeNiro's character is earning and why he lives in such a dump whilst owning such an expensive vehicle (although it does happen I know). There are a few bits that are difficult to believe, like the ending (it just seems to go a bit too far). But then to me, that's kind of the whole point of this film...Good bits It's fun!

That doesn't make them an intelligent person, he isn't meant to be; hence the poem is a bad one.Not every film needs to be ultra realistic.

You could say this is just another slasher movie, and you would be right if that is the view you wish to take on this film, but I am here to tell you, if you watch this as a metaphor than it will greatly improve your experience of watching the film.

Spielberg largely has influenced my interest in film and stories with Jaws, E.T., Third Encounters, Jurassic Park, etcetera, etcetera. He is a master of conventional entertainment by cleverly implementing life and wonder, awe and visual splendor into his pictures. He does not write these fables, he tells them with a voice and sensibility no other filmmaker has; like a unique, very beautiful, handwriting that actually reads better than the rest. His films have a heart, a soul, and a quiet sort of depth.I watched this movie again and not only was it great nostalgia, it was, as if for the first time, a wonderful experience. The sense of wonderment, the, at first, reluctant adventure, the central theme (as is with many Spielberg films) of family, self-discovery, the playful humor, and the heart it has that never skips a beat. No amount of criticism, observation, or trivia can take this film away from my list of favorite childhood films. I recommend this to every family that has children, every child that has dreams, and every adult that has an open-mind.Consider the scene when Tinkerbell flies through the window, and a startled Peter Banning swats at it as he would a fly Beautiful. Consider the scene where a groggy Peter Banning awakes on a Harbor full of Pirates, and breathlessly approaches one aberrant entity after another, surely belonging to a dream Imaginative. Consider the scene where a newly discovered Peter attempts to fly from a elevated rock, fails, then looks to a youthful reflection in the water and is struck on the head by his son's home-run ball Comforting. Consider the short-lived duel permitted by an arrogant, yet deeply tormented, Rufio where he is incapacitated by Hook then, in a touching last few moments, is disarmed by a father-esquire Peter Pan Touching.There are countless scenes I could revisit over and over again.Despite the constant criticism towards it over it's change in direction and the take on the story, it has no importance when it comes to deciding the enjoyment of this film. The themes it deals with is refreshing in it's form as a classic tale; the emotions ring true, if at times strangely, which is affectuous even when the tone feels uneven. The action, however highly dependant upon it's enormous sets and seemingly limitless props, is exciting, charming, and (unbelievable for popcorn entertainment) uncompromising to central events.There's no arguing that this is great entertainment for all ages (some, however, might have trouble stomaching the movies more tender moments). It is true that Spielberg was rushing for a deadline&#151;a deadline that had been late presenting itself&#151;and that many scenes could not be reshot as they were meant to be, and that the editing was not allowed an adequate time-frame. Spielberg acknowledges the penalty it took on the finished product, but never said he did not like the film (which is largely misconstrued). When you know you could've perfected something, in the eye of it's creator, it's easier to be disappointed by a finished work.My issues with the film are as follows The script, let me say that it feels as if it was written, reworked, still felt hokey, then was reworked again. However, Spielberg did a good job casting a spell with each and every scene, despite their inherent flaws. He reminds us, time and time again, that we care about these characters before it's too late. We are rescued, once again, I think to myself, from absorbing into an action orgy instead of a wonderfully bright, fun, and touching life lesson.For my last remarks, I will say that I am extremely appalled with a majority of viewers that have decided it Speilberg's Worst Film. Those that fall victim to a false loyalty to J.M. Barrie's masterpiece will probably never take their fervent emotions off their mind while watching Hook, and why should they?

Wilson first contacts the man who informed him of Jenny's passing, a friend from acting class named Ed. As Wilson slowly begins to piece the puzzle together with Ed's help, he comes to surmise that his daughter was murdered by a record-producer by day, cocaine-smuggler by night, named Valentine. After confronting and disposing of Valentine's second in command, Wilson decides to pay a visit to Valentine himself. Valentine's head bodyguard, Mr. Avery, quickly catches wind of the upcoming storm, and sets about paying off a hit-man to take care of his problem. Unbeknownst to Avery, Stacy the hit-man has a few cards up his own sleeve as well. A difficult situation becomes even more precarious once a third party shows up for the dance, and everything ties together with a resounding bang in the movie's unforgettable conclusion. The Limey builds up to a climactic shoot-out that is quick, calculated, and businesslike, but it ultimately leaves you scratching your head, searching for that fulfilling final bullet needed to put everything to rest.The Limey is unlike your typical revenge flick in the sense that you never really get the payoff that you expect. The good guy doesn't ride off into the sunset with Grace Kelly, with all of his problems solved and all of his troubles left behind. Wilson says that he wants Valentine to know why he has to do what he has to do, but when he's finally given his chance, he discovers that he has more to learn from Valentine than he had initially suspected. Was Wilson hoping to provide Valentine with answers, or was it the other way around? Was Wilson always out for vengeance, or was he secretly looking for redemption? Was Wilson somehow responsible for Valentine's actions? Could Wilson see his own reflection in Valentine's eyes, and could he achieve the satisfaction he desired without any sense of guilt or remorse? These are some of the questions that the movie's final scene proposes, bringing about a flurry of possibilities and uncertainties in a matter of mere minutes.Few of America's lone gunmen movies take the time to try and detail exactly what it is that makes its wayward triggermen tick, and maybe that's why it's so fitting that The Limey is about, well, a limey. Wilson is still a mysterious and soft-spoken murderer, but he's infused with a subdued humanity and incredulous charm that makes his actions all the more sympathetic and understanding. We understand why Wilson feels the need to carry out his revenge, and yet we are able to recognize the hypocrisy of his actions well before he comes to the same conclusion. It is only by seeking to rectify his daughter's death that Wilson realizes he is simultaneously cheapening her life, allowing his own sense of wrath and justice to serve as scapegoats for his own hidden regrets and remembrances. By the end of the movie, Wilson comes to discover that he has simply been hunting after himself all along. Valentine is not his daughter's murderer, he's simply the man who pulled the trigger. Wilson's daughter was dead long before she died, and all of the violence in the world could never bring her back.The Limey could aptly be described as the thinking-person's thriller, relying upon drama, psychology and emotion rather than purely non-stop action. The movie's interest does not lie in Wilson's angry actions so much as the motivations behind his pursuit. The Limey asks us many important questions that extend well beyond any specific genre. How far are we willing to go to avenge our loved ones, and at what point does it stop to be just about them, and start to become about us? What happiness can we find in projecting our own suffering onto others, and how does any of it bring us back to what we once cherished so much? How culpable are we in our own misery, and at what point does revenge become not nearly enough? Is atonement found in blind retaliation, or earnest introspection? And perhaps most importantly, what could we have done differently to simply avoid it all? The Limey shows us that our actions always influence those around us, and that our mistakes will always come back around to us in the end. When we fail to take responsibility for our failures, we lose sight of what truly matters, and we're left with nothing but regrets and fading memories of what truly might have been.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery"},{"date":"6 September 2006","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Upon receiving news of his daughter's accidental death, an English ex-con by the name of Wilson takes a hop across the pond to further investigate the possibility of foul play. Wilson first contacts the man who informed him of Jenny's passing, a friend from acting class named Ed. As Wilson slowly begins to piece the puzzle together with Ed's help, he comes to surmise that his daughter was murdered by a record-producer by day, cocaine-smuggler by night, named Valentine. After confronting and disposing of Valentine's second in command, Wilson decides to pay a visit to Valentine himself. Valentine's head bodyguard, Mr. Avery, quickly catches wind of the upcoming storm, and sets about paying off a hit-man to take care of his problem. Unbeknownst to Avery, Stacy the hit-man has a few cards up his own sleeve as well. A difficult situation becomes even more precarious once a third party shows up for the dance, and everything ties together with a resounding bang in the movie's unforgettable conclusion. The Limey builds up to a climactic shoot-out that is quick, calculated, and businesslike, but it ultimately leaves you scratching your head, searching for that fulfilling final bullet needed to put everything to rest.The Limey is unlike your typical revenge flick in the sense that you never really get the payoff that you expect. The good guy doesn't ride off into the sunset with Grace Kelly, with all of his problems solved and all of his troubles left behind. Wilson says that he wants Valentine to know why he has to do what he has to do, but when he's finally given his chance, he discovers that he has more to learn from Valentine than he had initially suspected. Was Wilson hoping to provide Valentine with answers, or was it the other way around? Was Wilson always out for vengeance, or was he secretly looking for redemption? Was Wilson somehow responsible for Valentine's actions? Could Wilson see his own reflection in Valentine's eyes, and could he achieve the satisfaction he desired without any sense of guilt or remorse? These are some of the questions that the movie's final scene proposes, bringing about a flurry of possibilities and uncertainties in a matter of mere minutes.Few of America's lone gunmen movies take the time to try and detail exactly what it is that makes its wayward triggermen tick, and maybe that's why it's so fitting that The Limey is about, well, a limey. Wilson is still a mysterious and soft-spoken murderer, but he's infused with a subdued humanity and incredulous charm that makes his actions all the more sympathetic and understanding. We understand why Wilson feels the need to carry out his revenge, and yet we are able to recognize the hypocrisy of his actions well before he comes to the same conclusion. It is only by seeking to rectify his daughter's death that Wilson realizes he is simultaneously cheapening her life, allowing his own sense of wrath and justice to serve as scapegoats for his own hidden regrets and remembrances. By the end of the movie, Wilson comes to discover that he has simply been hunting after himself all along. Valentine is not his daughter's murderer, he's simply the man who pulled the trigger. Wilson's daughter was dead long before she died, and all of the violence in the world could never bring her back.The Limey could aptly be described as the thinking-person's thriller, relying upon drama, psychology and emotion rather than purely non-stop action. The movie's interest does not lie in Wilson's angry actions so much as the motivations behind his pursuit. The Limey asks us many important questions that extend well beyond any specific genre. How far are we willing to go to avenge our loved ones, and at what point does it stop to be just about them, and start to become about us? What happiness can we find in projecting our own suffering onto others, and how does any of it bring us back to what we once cherished so much? How culpable are we in our own misery, and at what point does revenge become not nearly enough? Is atonement found in blind retaliation, or earnest introspection? And perhaps most importantly, what could we have done differently to simply avoid it all? The Limey shows us that our actions always influence those around us, and that our mistakes will always come back around to us in the end. When we fail to take responsibility for our failures, we lose sight of what truly matters, and we're left with nothing but regrets and fading memories of what truly might have been.

As Jimmy Breslin has often quoted, in NYC there are a million stories a day, and this was just one of them.Bebe Neuwirth and John Leguizamo are a gruesome couple, and I cannot get some of the visual imagery out of my mind. Lee has perhaps created the view of the killer, why he detests these people, why it is so offensive. Much has been made of the Italian-American communities; anyone who has ever lived in the metro NY area will know it is not an exaggeration; people who have lived in the same area stick to their own, while there are stereotypes, basically each group has its own dynamics- anyone who knows basic psychology understands the group mentality; the deferral of responsibility- survival for the weak is easier in a pack; the weak cannot survive alone, so they mesh together to form a unit.That being said, the stereotypes of Mira Sorvino, Ben Gazarra, and the police, as well as some of the crude and objectionable scenes with Patti Lupone and Adrian Brody have all served to show the director's vision; reasons why these people should be eliminated; reasons why New York is so offensive. Certainly, the killings were not done for financial gain; Son of Sam perhaps desired publicity, but what else was his motive?.The visuals are impressive; the Dead End where the neighborhood locals gather to sell drugs; the lunatic fringe; it seems a more elevated view to NOT divide the people into race or ethnic origin; they are simply there, and the killer has chosen them for his own personal reasons. Certainly, with Do the Right Thing Spike Lee touched a nerve in these communities. I respect his viewpoint because he is from Brooklyn, not the beaches of Malibu. I just read a review today delineating how Ozone Park was more of an Italian neighborhood, and any other race would stand out. Shows how segmented and rife with hatred these small communities can really be. Anyone who liked this film may also like Straight Out of Brooklyn by Matty Rich. Highly recommended. 9\/10.

I was also attracted to the Titanic's history although it was a very short one. That's why I also went to see every other movie on the ship that came across including Ome Night to Remember, S.O.S Titanic and James Cameron's huge Titanic too.One Night to Remember (1958, I think) is supposed to be the most accurate regarding actual facts, but it lacks tension because of a weak plot until the sinking and even Kenneth More looks bored and too calm during such a terrible disaster; a documentary film would have been better if historical accuracy was the target. S.O.S Titanic (1979), which starred David Janssen, is also dull and lacks impact and emotion. Finally, Cameron's version (1997), is certainly a big budget film but has undeniable major flaws such as Billy Zane chasing and shooting with a pistol at Leo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet with the water above his knees and at the precise moment everybody else was trying to save their lives with the ship nearly down.On the other hand Jean Negulesco's 1953 version is a simple movie that narrates interesting and credible situations involving some of the doomed passengers. The main one being the permanent confrontation between husband Richard Sturges (Clifton Webb) and wife Julia (Barbara Stanwyck) about their daughter and son's future life. He wants them to stick to their high society and somehow superficial living status and she wants them to live as more common persons as she was before marrying Richard (in fact Julia was heading with both youngsters too America without her husband's approval). A terrible confession about the past Julia makes to Richard during one of the usual discussions changes the man completely and from then on he avoids her mere prescence. That's the situation when the ship hits the iceberg.Clifton Webb is perfect as the sophisticated and sarcastic husband and Barbara Stanwyck renders a great performance too. The supporting cast which includes a young Robert Wagner, Thelma Ritter, Richard Basehart and the always reliable Brian Aherne (as Captain Smith), is also very good.The crash and the sinking sequences are very well done even for special effects of 1953. The drama and desperation atmosphere all over the sentenced liner is also perfectly managed.If you just consider that Negulesco's film gives Cameron's version more than 40 years of handicap in film technology there can be no doubt that the first is a far better movie.The opening scene where you can see the iceberg cracking out of an ice mountain, fall into the ocean and start its voyage to meet the Titanic is an intelligent idea that puts you into the matter right from the start.In all a very good dramatic movie based on actual facts, not matched yet by the numerous cinema and television versions that came later.

I originally gave this light comedy 3.5\/5, but on seeing it a second time could only give it a 2.5 &#150; and I think even that might be a little generous. There's too much about this film now that irritates the slow pace at which the story unfolds, Hugh Grant's trademark hesitant quirkiness, Julia Roberts' cloying I'm just a girl&#133; line, etc. And behind it all is the unshakable suspicion that Richard Curtis is running on autopilot, simply rehashing the same themes that worked so well for him with Four Weddings but which come across as so contrived here as to be nearly cynical. For example, choosing to have one character confined to a wheelchair seems either unashamedly manipulative or simply included to add a little something to the biggest loser speech in the dinner party scene &#150; which doesn't really work anyway.Grant is almost a parody of the old image he has since gone to some lengths to shed a dithering, stuttering, self-conscious throwback to the Ian Carmichael school of acting. Perhaps attempting to broaden the film's appeal beyond that of the middle-class, Curtis attempts an injection of crude humour in the form of Thacker's witless lodger, Spike. Spike is a working-class lout with dirty feet and a poor taste in tee-shirts, and so is exactly the type that someone like Thacker would run a mile from. But then, this is a film which seems to specialise in unlikely relationships perhaps, being a heterosexual male, I'm not really in a position to venture an opinion but, to me, it's impossible to see what a Hollywood mega-star like Scott would see in a knob like Thacker. But then I suppose that's the idea &#150; Curtis is simply exploiting that juvenile fantasy that lives, to some degree, within all of us.

James Cameron worked a miracle with this film and truly deserves every bit of credit and more... there is almost nothing bad I can say about this film except for the fact that the whole chase and shoot whilst boat is sinking was a little bit too far fetched...but hey, it's only a film and it was still good entertainment.If you haven't seen the film, please ignore the hate buzz around and watch it, you will enjoy it....9\/10 ","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"6 September 2006","score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" (some spoilers follow) I'm sad to say that Star Trek Insurrection is, to me, the weakest of the 10 Star Trek films produced to date. I really want to like it, because it at least attempts to have a sophisticated philosophical and moral component, but ultimately I find it to be preachy and - worse yet - rather flat.The beginning of the film shows some promise. The sequence when Data goes berserk, though hardly thrilling, is pretty exciting and it rouses the audience's curiosity about what's going on. Unfortunately, I think the screenwriters chickened out a bit and failed to really explore Data's potential as an antagonist (if only a temporary one).There's also some good character development and even some decent humor moments early on. I enjoy the romance scenes between Troi and Riker, and I wish their subplot was given some more screen time and development. (It sure is more interesting than watching Worf re-develop his adolescent acne troubles!) The film starts to fall apart in the second act, when the moral dilemma is introduced. Picard makes a lot of big speeches about how the forced relocation of the Ba'ku is a huge crime - but the film, and its villains, are so tame that I never really feel like the Ba'ku are in any great danger. Also, the Ba'ku society is simply unconvincing; it all seems too idyllic, too perfect. Their village doesn't look like a place where people really live - it's more like a superclean Hollywood set, isn't it? Speaking of the villains, they're unusually weak here, especially by Star Trek standards. F. Murray Abraham may have been great in Amadeus, but he's awful here as Ru'afo, the putty-faced bad guy. Great Star Trek villains of the past were usually either tough and over-the-top (like Khan), or cunning and dignified (like General Chang), but Ru'afo possesses none of these qualities. He's basically a whiny brat. At one point, he even emits a thoroughly childlike and embarrassing shriek of defeat - why should I respect this guy? The film also has other, production-related problems. It's the first Star Trek film to rely exclusively on computer-generated (CGI) special effects, and while some of the effects shots are pretty, others already look rather primitive and cartoon-like, by contemporary standards.Adding to the list of woes, the space battle scenes are distinctly lacking in verve. Part of the problem is the repetitive music, which fails to generate tension. There's also a lot of boring medium and long shots in the battle scenes. By contrast, Wrath of Khan and First Contact generally used close-up shots that were far more effective (the photon torpedoes in those films tend to shoot right toward the viewer's face, for example).I also really hate the fact that Riker needs to contrive a weird gimmick to defeat the Son'a ships, which somehow involves a joystick and lots of incomprehensible techno-babble. Why can't the Enterprise just tear into an enemy ship for a change? Why does there always have to be some stupid angle to the fights? Lest I sound entirely negative, I'd like to point out that Jonathan Frakes' direction in this film is still pretty solid (he also helmed the previous, far more successful Star Trek film, First Contact). He includes lots of lovely panoramic shots of the countryside that occasionally give the film a very poetic and attractive feel. But, by contrast, the interior sets - and I'm thinking chiefly of Ru'afo's ship here - are really ugly and crude-looking.On balance, then, I really believe this is the worst film of the Star Trek stable. There's no way I can accept that Star Trek V could be called worse than this! (Shatner at least had a clear vision for that film, even if its execution was flawed.) Even the often-tedious Star Trek I is better than Insurrection, if only because it has more dignity...
