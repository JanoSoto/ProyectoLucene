Pre-teen Zach & his little sister, not to mention the towns doctor are the only ones who seemingly realize that something is off, but can they stop the deadly infection before it reaches outside the grounds of the farm? Or will they too along with the world become infected?THE CURSE is a long forgotten about horror item that emerged during the horror movie craze of the 1980's. Throughout the years, THE CURSE has received somewhat of a mixed reaction from horror fans. What should be noted is how THE CURSE is actually an uncredited remake of the forgettable 1960's BORIS KARLOFF horror film DIE, MONSTER, DIE! & is based on the H.P. LOVECRAFT story THE COLOR OUT OF SPACE (Though he doesn't receive credit on this film) only updated to modern day with the New England setting being shifted to Tennessee. While far from being what one would call a good horror film, THE CURSE isn't really all that bad & actually has a lot of things going for it, while many horror fans might be turned away from the film due to it's slow burning story in the first half, those who stick around for the films second half will not be disappointed, especially gore hounds, as the film goes completely bat crap crazy with it's story, by going for broke & featuring some insane special effects which are really hideous, goopy & gory, featuring plenty of rotting flesh & hideous body meltdowns & puss filled boils & gory monster make-up. The characters while an interesting bunch, are somewhat eccentric & act a little weird even before the infection takes place. The film also sports an interesting twist at the climax Despite being featured extensively in the film, the character of the handsome, doctor who looks to be set up as the hero of the film & the only one, minus Zach the pre-teen hero & his younger sister to recognize something is badly wrong on the farm, only to be knocked off, with a minor character in the film, that of the agent sent to investigate the strange happening winding up being the hero!On the downside, while the script by A Nightmare On Elm Street 2 writer David Chaskin isn't to bad, the direction by first time helmer, actor David Keith (best known to television addicts for his role on STAR TREK THE NEXT GENERATION) is somewhat mediocre. Keith who is making his directorial debut here, somewhat fumbles when it comes to setting up suspense & tension. Many sequences in the film that could have produced a modicum of suspense & tension & delivered some really good scares, is robbed of it's impact, due to Keith seemingly not knowing on how to set up shock sequences & despite the beautiful setting, Keith also fails to inject much if any atmosphere in the film & he also fails to answer a burning question of whatever became of the farmhand who was helping the family on the farm & who was having an affair with the sexually frustrated wife of a strictly religious husband? He's featured quiet extensively in the first half of the film, before dropping out of the second half with no mention as to what has become of him. The acting is somewhat bland, with the late CLAUDE ATKINS the only one who really stands out as the religious stepfather who denies everything weird that is happening, even when his whole world comes crashing down around him. WILL WHEATON (who reportedly thought the film was stupid) is badly miscast as the hero & his real life sister Amy's character could so easily have been written out of the story & it wouldn't have made a difference to the films plot, since her character is utterly forgettable & adds nothing to the films plot. in fact one could almost assume that the only reason her character was here at all, was because Wheaton wouldn't sign on to the film unless his sister could also secure a role, with the film-makers ultimately obliging.Supposedly based on the social crises of the 1980's farmers during the Regan era! (?) The late LUCIO FULCHI served as a second until director.In the end, THE CURSE remains a watchable film at best, while the film has many moments to help it stand out, there is also just as much going against it than there is for it. In fact the film is for dedicated horror fans only, even if you're may like horror but don't don't get much out it & were curious about the movie, or if you're a fan of Will Wheaton & were yet to see the film & were curious about what it is like, I'd advise you not see the movie, since chances are good you'll just hate this movie down right. In this day & age of horror movie remakes THE CURSE could definitely benefit from one.

However the engagement to Vickie has set a screw loose in Larry's head & he often can't control himself on-air. The shows sponsor Charlie (Lou Hirsch) is about to fire him when Larry's psychiatrist Brother Dr. Paul Abbot (Paul L. Smith) assures Charlie that he can cure Larry by literally scaring the condition out of him when the entire Abbot family meet up together at their large ancestral mansion to celebrate Larry's engagement. As the guests begin to arrive strange things start to happen, Larry's Aunt Kate (Dom DeLuise) talks of a Werewolf, a family member (Roger Ashton-Griffiths) is murdered shortly after being told the contents of rich Aunt Kate's will, Larry begins to start seeing ghosts & quickly discovers not everything is as it appears...Staring, co-written & directed by Gene Wilder this is one tragic mess of a film, just about a complete failure on almost every level. The script by Wilder & Terence Marsh is supposed to pay homage to the old dark haunted house mysteries from the 30's like The Cat and the Canary (1939) among others. Unfortunately it also tries to mix other genres as well, comedy, musical & horror, quite simply it doesn't work in the slightest. The comedy elements are so unfunny I couldn't believe it, I did not laugh once during this film. It tries far too hard with all out slapstick, comedy sound effects & sequences which probably looked OK on paper but ended up being far from OK in the finished product. Scenes of Wilder trying to pass a dead body off as a living person by dancing with it in front of two idiotic cops (Billy J. Mitchell & R. J. Bell) is embarrassing to watch, or a scene in which Wilder is sitting on top of a stuffed moose head hiding from a snake is just dumb & Dom Deluise in drag as Aunt Kate is a truly hideous & laugh free image. Not one single moment of supposed comedy in Haunted Honeymoon worked for me, the jokes are far too drawn out & predictable. The mystery elements are better but are all but lost amongst the lame attempts at humour & nothing is explained, the killer is revealed but how he achieved certain things are unclear like them walking down a wall & those crazy mirror effects. There is even a brief musical interlude as Vickie & Aunt Kate perform a little number, once again it just comes across as embarrassing to watch. I also hated the ending, it makes a mockery of everything that precedes it & is just lazy & clichéd. One area in which Haunted Honeymoon does succeed is with it's good atmosphere, the period production design & sets are excellent & really capture the feel of those old horror mysteries. The cinematography & special effects are good & generally speaking Haunted Honeymoon is very well made with that Hollywood polish about it. The acting is pretty bad by all involved including Wilder whom I usually like, perhaps he was more concerned about behind-the-camera activities as director rather than acting in front of it, Dom Deluise is highly annoying & irritating as Aunt Kate. As far as I'm concerned Haunted Honeymoon is a complete failure as either a horror mystery or a comedy & I just can't see what sort of film goer this would appeal too & enjoy it.

The violence is not that disturbing here as in the first film, but part two also definitely has its cruel and nasty moments.

Foster adaptation looks into choices and decisions, much like Howards End, which also starred Helena Bonham Carter, and was an E.M. Foster adaptation, and also was a Merchant Ivory production. This film is a very standard costume drama, mixed with romantic comedy. I'm not the hugest fan of both, but I watched it anyway because of Helena because she is one of my favorite actresses and she steals almost every single scene in this film.Carter stars as Lucy Honeychurch, a young woman who goes to Florence as a tourist guided by her proper Aunt Charlotte. There she meets the Emersons, who offers the two women a room with a view because their rooms had a view and Lucy's and Charlotte's did not. The situations concludes in a romance between Lucy and George Emerson &#150; that saddest part is that I wasn't that interested in the two because I thought George was quite annoying (not because of Julian Sand's performance, though). When Lucy goes back home, she finds a more proper suitor, Cecil (Daniel Day-Lewis) who is as we call self obsessed. Cecil is educated and loves books and loves himself even more. I wouldn't call this a love triangle though. Cecil doesn't really care for Lucy, as we all know, but he is welcomed into the family with open arms. George comes into view and he tires to break the engagement somehow. As well know, he will break the engagement because Cecil is too much of a brat for any of us to really love.The only thing I liked about this film was Daniel Day-Lewis who is very funny as Cecil. I think he must be the funniest character in the film. He is so self-obsessed and conceited that you just have to like him. I never thought of Lewis as a comedic actor, but here he proves he can be whatever actor he likes. Maggie Smith is also very good as Charlotte &#150; somewhat funny and misunderstood in a way, but you kind of like her. Mr. Emerson, played by Denholm Elliot is also pretty good and believable as the father trying to teach his son the tactics of the world. Julian Sands, as I said &#150; I thought George was rather annoying. I wished they would have had made Rupert Graves as George and Julian Sands as Freddy Honeychurch. Graves and Carter show much more chemistry in the scenes where they are together as brother and sister because those scenes are extremely sweet. Not to mention Judy Dench was pretty funny as the writer at Florence.This is pretty sweet for a costume drama. When I think costume drama, I usually think Howards End or some Shakespearean adaptation, but this film is somewhat witty. I'm afraid to say I was a bit bored at some point. The film starts out really slowly and it feels as if the beginning would never end. In the middle, they kind of suck you into the story then you think, Ah, I get it. The cast assemble is really good, and the costumes and stage design is good as well. James Ivory does his special This is a Merchant Ivory Production touch onto the film. This film runs like a prose almost and the dialogue is extremely engaging. I wished the film interested me all the way through, though.

This movie captures that whimsy and is very entertaining, as a result. It begins rather mundanely - on purpose - during a standard science fiction convention, in which several actors, whose careers nosedived after starring in a canceled sci-fi TV show, are relegated to these cheesy appearances, signing autographs and hiding their disgust at what they've been reduced to. Well, except Tim Allen, who starts off very cheery until he has some ice water thrown in his face, a surprisingly effective moment. All the actors playing the actors fill out their roles very well. Tim Allen used to be the Capt.Kirk-type commander on the TV show; Weaver played his communications officer, like Uhura, and always repeated computer statements; Rickman was the alien doctor; Shalhoub was the Scotty-like tech man below decks; Mitchell was the pilot, like Sulu. Rockwell ends up along for the ride, even though he only appeared in one episode, as an expendable crewman.When everything shifts, about 20 minutes in, it's not very subtle. All of a sudden, these has-been actors are thrust into a very real galactic adventure. It's kind of a jaw-dropping scene, meant to inspire awe, and, at the same time, the humor is quite clever and thought out. The actors' reactions when they're first transported over several light years are priceless. And, even in already good moments like these, the filmmakers throw in an extra little slice of comedy, as one of the actors does not react as expected. Rickman stands out a bit as the huffy British actor, showing exasperation in almost every scene he's in, but it's never tiresome. Weaver & Allen exceed expectations, however; we're not used to seeing them in roles such as this. Allen is known for comedy, but here he's expected to draw out a character with a long history as a pretentious, sometimes failed actor, and he succeeds nicely. Rockwell nails the role of the nervous 3rd-stringer, a throwaway part usually, which he somehow manages to use to steal a scene or two. And Shalhoub, who we're used to being interesting by now, is very much so as the somewhat oddly serene member of the group. But the biggest surprises are Mitchell & Colantoni, whom I was unfamiliar with; Mitchell is terrifically funny attempting to navigate the real starship, while Colantoni offers the most unique interpretation of how a real alien would act & speak.There was obvious tinkering just before release of this movie to avoid a harsher rating or reduce the length, but these changes could not remove the charm of this sci-fi parody. And, simply labeling it parody may not do it justice. I think only those Trekkers who regard Star Trek as their personal religion may be offended by it; otherwise, any Trek fan should applaud this as mostly a tribute to such entertaining TV shows, recognizing all the little reminders of what made them such great shows. The theme of tolerance, for example, is represented by the strangely different but similar-to-us aliens who the audience cannot help but grow very fond of by the end of the story. On top of that, the so-called sci-fi geek fans, usually the object of scorn, are made the heroes by the end of the film. Everyone has their value in such a universe.

We had rented it with the original intention of trying to pick up filming, and character development techniques, as well as enjoying a film made on almost no money and with actors most movie catalogs didn't even have. We were excited and put it in the DVD player and sat down to enjoy something new and different for a change. I hated every second of it. Manly because it made me confused. I didn't know whether I should care about the characters involved or not and the bad acting didn't help there. I later bumped into a film buddy at collage and he said the bad acting in the movie was supposed to give it the depth of realism and dispel the viewers disbelief that what they were watching was really a movie. I have never heard of something more stupid in all my life. A character driven movie about two friends and a girl from out of town who escape from absolutely nothing to find absolutely nothing is the most ridiculous movie concept I have ever heard of. To make matters worse, I couldn't get to know the characters very well, so there was no way to sympathize with how they were feeling about being in the situation that they were in. It was particularly hard to sympathize with them when they really didn't show the kind of exaggerated emotions that you normally see in a film to help you easily recognize what the hell is going on. There are purists who would say that, that was the whole point. To have an incredible depth of realism. To immerse yourself in the movie so far that then you would sympathize with the characters, because you finally are getting in touch with what they are going through. But really when is anyone really that strung up in a film, especially about three friends from Jersey who go to Florida to escape the monotony of their lives only to find that they have to go home because they have no money. The other reason I disliked the film was there was no point even some of the most experimental films have a plot that goes somewhere and characters who are driving the movie though the story and bringing it to its logical or inevitable ending. There was no one behind the wheel of this movie. In this movie all there was, was a half drunken idiot behind the wheel of a Gremlin, traveling around in no particular direction. Even story edicate wasn't followed. The highs and lows making way to a dramatic and logical conclusion. Nope not there just the story of these people doing' stuff. But I digress.In the movie however are some intriguing moments of sexual tension between first cousins and friends as well as a great amount of fantastic photography I think that the movie was incredibly shot but that the movie just wasn't entertaining, and no matter how much a film is art, even the most obscure Picaso painting or, Fallini film is entertaining and thats just what I didn't get out of this film entertainment.

To make matters worse, I couldn't get to know the characters very well, so there was no way to sympathize with how they were feeling about being in the situation that they were in. It was particularly hard to sympathize with them when they really didn't show the kind of exaggerated emotions that you normally see in a film to help you easily recognize what the hell is going on. There are purists who would say that, that was the whole point. To have an incredible depth of realism. To immerse yourself in the movie so far that then you would sympathize with the characters, because you finally are getting in touch with what they are going through. But really when is anyone really that strung up in a film, especially about three friends from Jersey who go to Florida to escape the monotony of their lives only to find that they have to go home because they have no money. The other reason I disliked the film was there was no point even some of the most experimental films have a plot that goes somewhere and characters who are driving the movie though the story and bringing it to its logical or inevitable ending. There was no one behind the wheel of this movie. In this movie all there was, was a half drunken idiot behind the wheel of a Gremlin, traveling around in no particular direction. Even story edicate wasn't followed. The highs and lows making way to a dramatic and logical conclusion. Nope not there just the story of these people doing' stuff. But I digress.In the movie however are some intriguing moments of sexual tension between first cousins and friends as well as a great amount of fantastic photography I think that the movie was incredibly shot but that the movie just wasn't entertaining, and no matter how much a film is art, even the most obscure Picaso painting or, Fallini film is entertaining and thats just what I didn't get out of this film entertainment.

I had seen this movie with a film making Buddy of mine. We had rented it with the original intention of trying to pick up filming, and character development techniques, as well as enjoying a film made on almost no money and with actors most movie catalogs didn't even have. We were excited and put it in the DVD player and sat down to enjoy something new and different for a change. I hated every second of it. Manly because it made me confused. I didn't know whether I should care about the characters involved or not and the bad acting didn't help there. I later bumped into a film buddy at collage and he said the bad acting in the movie was supposed to give it the depth of realism and dispel the viewers disbelief that what they were watching was really a movie.

But, omitting that--yeah, i know it's hard to omit that a movie labeled as horror is not scary--, i judge it as a very interesting film. The production design is great; the glass house is a state of the art, away from your typical haunted house, looking both luxurious and somehow creepy at the same time. That innovation, carried out with such a splendid result, is worth my applause. So is the decision to make the ghosts be real actors in the set, not digital freaks. Human monsters, even if having to go through 4+ hours of make-up sessions, even if having to use a double amputee actor to play a particular ghost, are the film's best trump card.

It's all overseen by cold cruel Regina (Bette Davis) who will do anything to get what she wants.Just simply this is great. I was never bored once during the entire 2 hours this ran. I literally couldn't stop watching. The script (very close to the play) is wonderful--one great line after another. It's also well-directed by William Wyler--just his composition of shots was incredible. Purportedly he put his actors through hell with take after take--but it works. This is a rare movie where ALL the acting is great--not one bad performance up there. Teresa Wright is a little too whiny--but this was her first film. Even Richard Carlson is good! Who ever knew he was so handsome and could act? He was wasted in all those action and sci-fi pics he did. Davis, of course, gives the best performance. She obviously relishes playing a totally evil character.This movie has many great moments but, for me, there are two highlights--Carlson has a GREAT moment where he casually tells off Davis (how many actors can stand up to Davis--and live?) and the last talk between Davis and Herbert Marshall (playing her husband). This isn't for everybody--with the exceptions of Carlson, Marshall and Wright there isn't one sympathetic character. This may be too cold and cruel for some viewers, but I was fascinated throughout.

If they knew it was my 2nd favorite movie of all-time, could they have charged me more? Anyway I watched it this morning and here's my observations-To fully appreciate the movie, you have to (1) know it is loosely based on a true story (2) have watched the TV series from the 60's. -This movie contains the only enjoyable role ever played by Tommy Lee Jones. -It's probably also Harrison Ford's last good movie, unless you count Air Force One as a comedy. -I reckon if he went in the outfit he stole from the old guy in the hospital in his initial court trial and not the suit with the beard, he would have got off with good behavior. -Great quote 1 (when he's being quizzed at the station) Financially, you're not gonna be hurting after this. I'm gonna use that when consoling people at the next funeral I attend of a well-off family. -I know it would have ruined the film, but I gotta ask, if they're killing people to cover up this thing, why didn't they kill Kimble? Didn't it occur to them that even is they successfully framed him and he went to prison to wait for the lethal injection, he would have had a few years to do research and chase down the one armed man. All he needed was internet access and someone like Chloe from 24and he would have solved it in a week. -That bus rollover is still one of the best car accident scenes in a movie. Brilliant. The train crashing into it is even better. Watch the DVD to see the fascinating insight to the making of that scene. Amazing. The only digital effect was Kimble jumping from the bus. -Great quote 2 from Deputy Gerrard You wanna change your %^&*(*&^ story -Great quote 3 from Deputy Gerrard Think me up one of them chocolate donuts with the sprinkles on top -The tunnel scene is totally implausible. Watching closely you'll see cops from both ends were no more than 20 meters from him- and they missed seeing him jump down a sewer. That's not even considering the jumping off bit. -One thing everyone in the world knows from movies. If you have to call the cops, don't talk too long or they'll trace the call. Be careful if you're ever in this position of cops trying to drag out the call. -It's amazing that this movie isn't particularly brilliant in any one area, yet it keeps you gripped the whole way.

Almost no matter what wrongs you have done in your life this movie will make you feel a little better. Body Heat also has the benefit of having one of the great soundtracks by John Barry in my opinion. The title song is transcendental if you like smoky Jazz. The sex element isn't that important to me here because as great as Kathleen Turner is in the movie she just isn't that much of a siren to me. Beautiful in that cheerleader way though...yes. Ted Danson is terrific and funny in his supporting role. After watching this movie several(dozen) times I've found what I think are several semi-hidden clues to indicate the direction things are going in Body Heat. Some of them are more obvious like a shot of a spider web. Others are a lot more subtle. I found these to be a lot of fun. Ultimately the fact that William Hurt gets caught up in something so horrible and still remains likable is one of the greatest things about the movie.

Also, when the camera switches back to the pimp, its reversed from what was shown in the rear view mirror. This isn't a everything is backwards in a mirror thing.

'The Producers', 'Blazing Saddles' and for me especially 'Young Frankenstein' belong the funniest I have seen. They told a story from tart to finish and the jokes found their way into that story. 'History of the World Part I' is again funny, but it is very flawed as well. This movie does not tell a story with gags in it, it tells gags with a couple of stories around it.Mel Brooks seems to have chosen a couple of events in our history, at random, as long as his jokes would fit there. We start with the dawn of men, the stone age and a story around the ten commandments. These segments are not that long and I found them hilarious. The narrator, Orson Welles, explains us how things started back then, things like singing and painting. It is the kind of humor that requires a certain taste, but if you like it Mel Brooks is as good as it gets. Most of the time.We continue with longer segments including one in the Roman Empire which starts great but after a while it overstays its welcome, a musical number dealing with the Spanish Inquisition that has the same problem, and one during the French Revolution that is not that funny at all. Especially in these sequences we see how Brooks has the idea of a funny gag, puts a story around it without really doing something with both the idea of the gag and the story. It is like watching Jim Carrey doing funny faces without a reason for doing that. His funny face can be funny when it is serving something, it is not simply funny on its own.Near the end Brooks finds his way again and shows us what we could expect in Part II. I laughed like I did in the first half of the movie and that gave me the feeling the movie is funnier and better than it actually is. Fans of the genre will enjoy this enough, there is some real Mel Brooks magic here, but if you are still finding out whether you like this or not I would start somewhere else. 'Young Frankenstein' would be a nice choice. ","genre":null},{"date":"8 October 2005","score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Mel Brooks delivers funny movies.

Still I felt that something is missing. Unlike Mulholland Drive, Blue Velvet rises a lot of questions that remain unanswered which contributes to different interpretations of the movie. After seeing Blue Velvet for the second time I got slightly disappointed because my better comprehension of the movie didn't spill a new light on it. And after all, it appears to me, that like in Mulhollnad Drive, there is no sophistical hidden story beyond the one we see, it's only a simple one, masked beautifully by the director's style. Seeing Blue Velvet after Mulholland Drive I was inclined to think that major part of the movie was a dream. That is from camera entering into the cut ear till exiting Jeffery's. This possibility was clear enough from the movie itself, though there are some clues that make this assumption more real. First of all, is the weird people like Ben, Paul and the Blind man in the store. Second is the repetitions. We are shown twice candle light, police - ambulance light. Twice Sandy and Jeffery dine in Arlenes, each time we are shown the restaurant a Trailer passing before it's entrance. Third are the gaps in logic. For instance, Jeffery made some photos with his creative camera but one thing he couldn't do with his camera is to point it on the subjects. Forth is Frank's quoting of Roy Orbison's song In Dreams, 'In dreams I walk with you, In dreams I talk to you...'.But even in this interpretation, the end is enigmatic. And many questions arise about the connection of the dream scenes to reality. Who really is the pervert? So maybe the whole thing doesn't have a clear plot but a symbolic one of the dark reality and roses like dreams that come in the end ( So maybe the end is a dream and everything else is reality).Blue Velvet is accompanied with good soundtrack, classic songs and outstanding lead performances. The movie is very memorable and leaves a strong impression.Seeing this movie, made me realize what a great movie Mulholland Drive is. David Lynch seems to be constantly improving. The cinematography, the plot and the soundtrack from Eraser to Mulholland Drive gets better and better.

So what are we left with? Plenty of humor, some of which actually works and a few scenes of entertainment. About ten minutes of actual entertainment scattered over just over 100 minutes of film.
