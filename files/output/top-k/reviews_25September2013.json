The classic save the world\/universe storyline, done right. Many things are incorporated into this movie to make it every genre you could imagine. Mostly classified as a Sci-Fi, some may also say it is a comedy, action, or love movie. Luc Besson has managed to incorporate nature into the future. Many people see the future as chrome. This movie sees it as a ghetto, dirty place where greenery no longer flourishes. Fast food chains and major corporations rule, with practically no trees or natural monuments. A classic, one man, Korben Dallas, must save the future world from a certain doom and find love at the same time. The Fifth Element is a beautiful movie because of its unique presentation of a very common plot.Every save the world\/universe movie we know ends and starts the same. A man or woman who is no longer part of any military or government-based program is chosen to save the world. They do not want to do it but they are the only ones on the earth who can do it. Of course, The Fifth Element takes this concept and uses it, but in a beautiful, never done before way. This movie uses the future with flying cars, unbelievable skyscrapers, space ships, and alien life, and shows a different take on it. These buildings, cars, and even people in major cities and not glamorous and glorified. They are worn-out, run down, and crummy. This is a more realistic interpretation of the future because of the way we are spiraling down. In this movie, Bruce Willis plays a man Korben Dallas, a simple city cab driver and ex-military man, who of course, must save the universe from a certain fatal death. He must go on a cruise ship to find these four element stones and use them with the fifth element to save the world from certain death. The antagonist, Zorg, and the protagonist, Korben, are all trying to find the stones to use them for good or to use them for evil. Korben, as well as Zorg, are one of many characters that you find make this movie what it is.Not only is the plot phenomenal, but the characters and their development with the plot as well. The characters in this movie are ones who form the plot to be what it is. I know it's the same in every movie, but for this one practically everyone plays a part. Leeloo, the love interest, is the supreme human being, or in other words, perfect. In this movie, she is first an alien of what is believed to be the divine race, and what is found of her remains becomes reconstructed in a laboratory where when she becomes human or looks to us what would be normal, you find that she has bright orange hair, a thin figure, and a face with no-make up. Most people would find this unattractive, which is another reason I find this movie so beautiful. It shows true beauty in almost everything. There is another character named Ruby Rhod, who Korben is pretty much partnered up with after winning the contest hosted by Ruby to win the cruise tickets. Ruby is a radio show host, very popular; whom many would say is metrosexual. He cares very much about his looks and that his show goes well. I would like to think of Ruby as the comedy figure in this film. Other characters such as the priest, his assistant, and even the president all make this movie what it is and all tie it in together. Cornelius, the priest, and his assistant both play a huge role by telling the story of how the evil came to be. Zorg, who is the antagonist of the story, plays a beautiful part. His unique look and superb acting skills help this movie form. From the very beginning of the movie, he plays a very important role of telling what is going on, what he is doing, and how he's going to do it. There are so many beautiful things about this movie, from the actors and their characters, to the graphics and plot. This movie is a must see for everyone because of its wonderful rendition on a common and almost boring plot. In my opinion this movie is going to be a forever sci-fi, action classic.

There is nothing like it and its simplicity is, I think, what compelled people to love it.The movie, starring Ethan Hawke and Julie Deply, is about both young American Jesse and French Celine. They met in a train bound for Vienna and talked a little about each other. Each has no idea where their simple conversation would lead. Everything that happened on that day happened naturally, all unplanned. They spent the night in Vienna, walking around the city, visiting famous landmarks and talking, revealing details about themselves like they've been friends for quite some time.It's a no brainer to figure out that there is going to be more of Jesse's introduction\/pep talk to Celine on the train. And while waiting for something out of the ordinary in the plot, I find myself enjoying the mundane things the film is showing. As I've said, it's the simplicity of the movie that draws its audience to finishing it and listening intently to the lines of the characters.Three things that I like about Before Sunrise are as follows1. Good script. Not great but good. But that is the beauty of it, there are no filled with ripe wisdom lines that characters are throwing but the good script makes audience know who is the cynic and who is the romantic at heart but is careful at loving. The script even makes it worth waiting how the film is going to end.2. Good theme. This one is one of the things unmasked by number 1. Jesse and Celine have fallen into minor disagreements and I find myself comfortable with it. I don't even take sides, I just let it be. I enjoy the role of an observer. Point is, the characters are two young souls who are still in the process of knowing themselves and having been through experiences that may have torn them but they talk about it comfortably. Their self-discovery is a work in progress and their self- fulfillment could be a case-to-case basis but it's there.3. Sense of Wonder. Unlike some friends who were left hanging with the story's ending, I was basking in the sense of wonder. I actually find this part realistic. After knowing that a romance is brewing and realizing that the film's about to end, I enjoyed wondering what it is going to be for Jesse and Celine.Before Sunrise is no perfect movie but it will make you feel better about a lot of things life, love, friends, family, and faith. If these things interest you, this one is for you. Highly recommended!

Jamie Escalante gave me newfound hope that teachers actually do care about giving their students a memorable education. He was a courageous and pugnacious man who would stop at nothing to make sure his students knew the value of education. Edward James Olmos's portrayal of Jamie Escalante gives Jamie the justice he deserves. It really is a magnificent performance. He manages to maintain Jamie's tenacity, and never give up attitude.

It aches of the substance we miss so much in modern cinema- Story along with intrigue and characters we love to hate. We all know what's going to happen in 'The Maltese Falcon' but we are still compelled as the story unfolds each time we watch it. The Ninth Gate has this quality in abundance. Some of the rolls aren't particularly well acted , Polanski's (Director) wife for instance but she is none the less absorbing.

And that's the case in Rambo First Blood Part II. Sylvester Stallone plays John Rambo, an ex-Green Beret who is in prison for what he has done in the first movie. If you remember from the first movie, Stallone's character was hunted by a small-town sheriff and the National Guard. In that film, he stages a one-man war against them. Now, his colonel decides to give Rambo a mission. The mission is to go back to Vietnam to take photographs of the American POW's that were left behind in Vietnam. But, Stallone, like any other action hero tough guy, doesn't listen. Instead, the movie shows him doing what he does best, mowing down the enemies with a machine gun. One thing that I like about the movie is the exploding arrows that Rambo carries in the movie. I'll tell ya, those exploding arrows really come in handy. Now, there are logical errors in this movie that some people can point out. In one scene, Rambo attacks one of the Russian soldiers in the jungle. He camouflaged himself with mud. Now, you may ask yourself a couple of questions. What if the soldier walk past Rambo and Rambo didn't get the chance to attack him? How did he cover his other arm with mud? That kind of movie error may be obvious, but to me, it's just a rub-off. This is the kind of movie that action movie-goers will love. It has its moments of errors, but that didn't stop me from liking it. Rambo First Blood II is a exciting, adventurous, movie. It's action sequences are over the top and very visually stunning and does what any other big action summer movie does. You sit back and watch the excitement roll over you. ★★★ 3 stars.

It might well be a well-produced drama of the sort the UK excels at but personally, I find such costumed outings rather dour, plodding affairs. However, this movie - with its Agatha Christie-style country house and a cast-list for the ages - offers something a little different. It still feels a little slow but it offers an authentic look at class, privilege and gender politics. It's also brilliantly written, directed and performed and is probably Roger Altman's best film after MASH.In 1932, Sir William McCordle (Michael Gambon) and his trophy wife Sylvia (Kristen Scott Thomas) invite a number of guests over for a shooting weekend. Among their guests are matinée idol Ivor Novello (Jeremy Northam) and his Hollywood producer friend Morris Weissman (co-producer Bob Balaban) as well as the Countess of Trentham (Maggie Smith) and her maid-servant Mary (Kelly MacDonald). As the weekend goes on, Sir William has to fend off constant attempts to secure his fortune from his guests while the gossiping house-staff, led by his butler Jennings (Alan Bates) and housekeeper Mrs Wilson (Helen Mirren), ensure that the weekend goes as smoothly as possible. Before long, a murder is committed but who is the guilty party? Is it head house-maid Elsie (Emily Watson) who has something to hide? Could it be enigmatic valet Mr Denton (Ryan Phillippe) or charismatic loner Parks (Clive Owen), the valet of Lord Stockbridge (Charles Dance)? Hopefully, Inspector Thomson (Stephen Fry) and his constable companion Dexter (Ron Webster) can crack the case before all the guests have to return home...Like most murder mysteries, Gosford Park spends a lot of time filling the screen with details both relevant and irrelevant. In fact, the murder is arguably the most surprisingly thing about the film as so much time is spent with both upstairs with the party-goers and downstairs with the staff that it almost feels like a documentary at times. To prevent boredom from completely taking over, the film injects a good deal of humour into proceedings - Smith's cantankerous countess is witty and loaded with barbed asides while Fry's detective is as gloriously aloof as those he interviews, maintaining an almost Clouseau-like ignorance of the facts presented to him. But all the cast are superb - I've never seen this many British stars at once outside of a Harry Potter film - but this is a true ensemble piece as dialogue blends together to further enhance the authentic feel of the film. The script, penned by Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes, leaves just enough to keep you guessing but because it spends so long setting the crime up, you sort of feel as though he's more concerned about writing a period piece as opposed to a mystery.Although it won't be to everyone's taste, Gosford Park feels like a big-screen outing for Mrs Marple but without the silver-haired sleuth in attendance. Yes, it's brilliantly made and at times very funny but I wanted a bit more pace to proceedings. I honestly felt that once every red herring imaginable had been planted in the first hour-and-a-bit, Fellowes simply worked out yet another possibility and wrote that as the ending. And to be frank, the climax felt a little rushed and the least believable bit of the picture as nobody actually seems that bothered that they've spent the weekend with a murderer in their midst. Still, credit must go towards the look of the film which is spot-on and the actors who are all magnificent. In truth, the film is less a murder-mystery and more a realistic portrayal of life in a country house in the early 1930's. Fellowes almost feels nostalgic for such a time when ladies knew their place, their men could be utter cads without them batting an eyelid and both were wholly reliant on their staff, who held them in mock-respect as though their livelihoods depended on it - which they did, of course. It is as British as Earl Grey tea, cucumber sandwiches and strawberries and cream at Wimbledon - something which appeals more to foreign markets more than the UK where I'm from.

And then he directed the timeless classic Jaws, the first big box office film, which opened doors to him to show his geniality like someone never did before in this forgotten masterpiece! Close Encounters begins at a night as any other in the live of Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss) the typical American citizen, working at the power station in their small town of Indiana, playful with his kids and loving to his wife. When one night, the entire city suffers a huge power blackout, and Roy is called to try to identify the source of the problem. In the middle of traffic, Roy's truck is covered by a strong white light coming from above, and then he sees strange bright objects in the sky and the light fading around the city. Days pass and Roy begins to have strange visions of a mountain, and five musical notes start running in his head always at the same pace, taking Roy to have attacks of insomnia and do crazy things, thus losing his job and his family fleeing from home. But Roy finds out later that he is not the only one having these visions when he meets Jillian Guiler (Melinda Dillon) who also has visions and his son Barry was captured during a storm with red lights, and the mountain of his visions exist in the country and is being used by the military as a study center recently. Roy then begins to embark on a research to find out what musical notes means and what will happen on that mountain.This was the first personal project of Spielberg, thanks to the success of Jaws he managed to realize it, and showed his genius as ever. The film from the beginning follows a realistic style, as their characters are like any other human with their own problems, and as if everything was happening in our world on a day like any other (something that had already been demonstrated and guaranteed success the Jaws). Thanks to the realism that Spielberg puts in the film and its characters, we can totally put us in place of Roy and into his confused mind by the whole mystery around them, and our minds begin to take turns asking what the heck is going on.Spielberg in the film, kind of uses the same style that Stanley Kubrick used in 2001, both films totally different but share the same technique. It shows little dialogue and uses scenes and more scenes brilliantly. And the scientific theories used to build the mysterious climax of the film comes from years and years of real mysterious cases that happened in our world, everything come together in small pieces along the film through a brilliant narrative and majestic scenes (as I said , the same technique of 2001 though not better).A story strongly told thanks to the brilliant screenplay (written by Spielberg himself), the film also does not disappoint with a brilliant direction and a superb soundtrack by John Williams. And it contains one of the most beautiful visual effects ever made up, that even today left people speechless.A masterpiece that showed the genius of Spielberg to the world as no other director had ever shown before, mixing facts and more facts of strange cases that happened in our world with a philosophic and religion tone, and the most original sci - fi style ever made. All together with a superb performance from Dreyfuss and a strong script that holds your attention until the great 3rd act where all the mystery and the facts come together and the philosophical symbolism that makes your mind explode and your eyes sparkle when witnesses the best sci - fi ever made and the most ambitious movie of the legendary Spielberg!10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"25 September 2013","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Spielberg had already proved his great talent in the underrated masterpiece The Sugarland Express , but it didn't receive the deserved appreciation at the time.

I'd put those two in their league, with virtually all others far behind.But even in the next tier of gangster films we have A Bronx Tale, Casino, Donnie Brasco, and quite a few more, all of which easily outrank Goodfellas. I'd probably put it below Miller's Crossing even; while it is much better in some aspects, but worse in a smaller number of much more important ones.It's entertaining, it doesn't bore you, and it doesn't have any obvious technical flaws (plot holes, etc). The characters are very well defined, the acting is great.But it lacks depth.My primary problem with Goodfellas, the best I can articulate it, is that there is absolutely nothing to the main character. He's not even likable for that matter. He has little to no conscience and nothing in the way of deep thoughts. The entire movie is a self narrated glamorization of the gangster lifestyle simply for the sake of being what it is, to the point of what I can only describe as childishness even. And at the end of the movie he winds up ratting everyone else out to save his own skin.You just can't sympathize with the guy, at all.This movie could have been a lot more substantial. The elements for a great movie are all there.For example, Tommy's VERY convincing character had potential to play into a much more thought provoking central philosophical point to the movie - but it didn't. The best I can put it is that it almost seems as if much of the good things about this movie were wasted on an inherently flawed central theme.Donnie Brasco is a good example here. It took this type of character, and used it to really drive home a powerful point. It presents a very captivating ethical conflict within the story - it makes you think.On the other hand, Goodfellas doesn't even begin to approach anything so substantial. Even were a one sided and non thought provoking story to be acceptable, it sure isn't so when the one sided POV represented is an utterly unsympathetic one.Again, not a bad movie, but hardly a masterpiece.

Not any type of expert critic but I have seen virtually every film in this genre upwards of ten times.Let me start off by saying this is a good movie.But this is not even in the same league as other movies in this genre, such as the obligatory Godfather, or in my opinion, Once Upon a Time in America, one of my all time favorites. I'd put those two in their league, with virtually all others far behind.But even in the next tier of gangster films we have A Bronx Tale, Casino, Donnie Brasco, and quite a few more, all of which easily outrank Goodfellas. I'd probably put it below Miller's Crossing even; while it is much better in some aspects, but worse in a smaller number of much more important ones.It's entertaining, it doesn't bore you, and it doesn't have any obvious technical flaws (plot holes, etc). The characters are very well defined, the acting is great.But it lacks depth.My primary problem with Goodfellas, the best I can articulate it, is that there is absolutely nothing to the main character. He's not even likable for that matter. He has little to no conscience and nothing in the way of deep thoughts. The entire movie is a self narrated glamorization of the gangster lifestyle simply for the sake of being what it is, to the point of what I can only describe as childishness even.

In & Out is the funniest movie I've seen recently. It has one of the most intelligent stories I have ever seen! Every hilarious scene is filled with irony and self-directed criticism to the own American society, who tries to hide everything that doesn't fit well. The most clever and sarcastic scene is when Howard states he's gay in moment of her wedding, and once his mother hears that, she tries to fix it by saying he meant he is having a wonderful day. From that moment on, I just kept constantly laughing, getting surprised every while. Other than that, not only directing and writing are great, but the cast is also extremely professional, delivering unexpected situations all the time. It's also interesting to notice how filmmakers show the way men are supposed to behave; we've always been induced to not dance, sing, speak mildly and stuff like that, otherwise we'd be compared to female or homosexual guys, which we should run from. You know, this movie was released in 1997, but current society is still very chauvinist and intolerant, in a point that I don't know if it changed significantly since the nineties. The controversy whether the main character is gay or not is irrelevant in this movie, given that the main pursuit is show how people behave in situations like that-- and I may state it's completely real. So that's it. In & Out is one of the most mature, clever and surprising comedies you'll ever get a chance to see. Congratulations for the team!

The opening shower scene was so awkward, voice overs, obvious body double and all, that it ended up being laughable. Brian De Palma is also to blame for that.But now that Ms. Dickinson's boobs and vagina have got your attention, there's some tedious cat and mousing through an art museum which culminates in our sexually frustrated, unhappily married old gal getting some from a handsome stranger in the back of a yellow cab and then in his nicely appointed penthouse apartment. Afterglow doesn't fully set in until she finds his membership card to an exclusive club while rummaging around for some paper to write him a little goodbye note of appreciation. Aawwww! -) But, of course, a woman going after good sex and getting it has to pay the price. 1) She also finds a doctor's record showing that loverboy has contracted a venereal disease. 2) In her haste to leave her diseased lover's abode (I assume with the intention of running home and showering in bleach) she remembers that she left her wedding ring in his apartment. 3) On the return trip in the elevator, she is joined by a mother and little daughter. The daughter keeps staring at her because ...even small children know a freshly diseased whore when they see one? 4) She never makes it out of the elevator because she is then stabbed to death in the elevator by a tall blonde woman.Bear in mind that her dead body is to be found sans underpants (they were forgotten in the cab), no wedding ring, covered in blood and containing traces of diseased semen not belonging to her husband. If all this doesn't send every unfulfilled wife running back to the apathetic arms of their betrothed, I don't know what will.The rest of the movie is some half-baked nonsense about schizophrenic transexuality which is as equally grounded in maintaining the patriarchal status quo as this movie's take on women passed a certain age being sexual beings. There is also a splash of racism as a group of young (jive talking', of course) black men chase one of the main characters (a young, white prostitute) through a subway train with the intention of raping and beating her... just because. 3 stars for at least being stylish.

Also, the only happy person is unceremoniously killed half-way through! This is not a movie the director could have made in Hollywood&#x97;the Hayes office would never have allowed it. What with the killing of a central character, an innocent kid, plus an unpunished murder by another central character, there's no way the film could have originated stateside. Nonetheless, it's one of Hitch's most interesting since it raises a number of complex moral issues attaching to both guilt and innocence. Most saliently, should Mrs. Verloc (Sydney) be allowed to walk away from killing her husband unpunished, and if so, why?Also, there's the issue of terrorism, not dealt with by many films of the time, but which seems very topical in our own day. Apparently, the terrorist killing of the boy (Tester) has been a controversial part of the film over the years, since it's so wrenching and goes against unwritten movie-making norms. Nonetheless, I think it's an important part of the story since it calls attention to the death of innocents caused by terrorist acts, whether the bombs are planted or come from the sky. I'm glad Hitch had the gumption to include it.Anyway, it's not a movie to see if you're depressed. The lighting is dark, the mood somber, with a doleful Sydney, a sour-faced Homolka, and a conflicted Loder. Still, it's good to see so many Londoners going to the movies in those days, even if they do want their money back. In my view, it's one of Hitch's most daring movies, British or American.

I had relatively low expectations for Part III, but I was feeling excited to watch it at the same time since the first two films were so memorable. I didn't find it bad, but it certainly had many problems. I didn't like how they wrapped the whole Fredo story arc in only a couple of minutes, so I thought that was a wasted opportunity. In addition, Connie not being suspicious at all with what happened to him at that time wasn't very believable for me as she knew how ruthless Michael used to be. There are plenty of cheesy romantic scenes involving Mary Corleone and Vincent Mancini, which could have been diminished. There are also a lot of long expository conversations and some of them weren't really interesting or that relevant to the story. Finally I couldn't feel that grandiosity and great cinematic experience from the first films here. Honestly, it had a TV Movie vibe for me at times. Even the classic theme composed by Nino Rota wasn't so striking as Part III didn't really have many remarkable scenes to match such a powerful score.Al Pacino reprises his role as an aging Don Michael Corleone, but I couldn't see him as that same fearless and determined person from the last two segments. I know Michael has changed a lot over the years and is seeking redemption, but he just looked like a completely different individual to me. Also, I thought his performance was a bit stale at times though he was excellent in the last moments of the film. Now the supporting characters weren't so memorable in this third chapter. I missed seeing Tom Hagen portrayed by Robert Duvall here and thought Andy Garcia did okay as Vincent Mancini though he seemed to be blatantly imitating Sonny a little at first. Vincent has a a crucial moment towards the end, but I had that feeling of deja vu so the way Francis Ford Coppola decided to handle his path ended up being repetitive and uninspired.Overall, The Godfather Part III was inconsistent and didn't work that well as a film for me.

I get chills every time I watch this film and this film contains the greatest ending (which takes place over the last 30 minutes or so)in movie history! How it all just comes together is so incredible and uplifting. I should also mention the music in this movie is nearly flawless as well, and the soundtrack is a must buy for any music fan. The only bad thing about this movie is the fact that I know I will never see a better movie, no matter how many I may see. I've seen many movies over the past few years, many excellent films. However, every time I walk out of the theater, I turn to my friend or family member that I saw it with and I say, That was a great movie, but it wasn't nearly as good as 'you know what'! There have been many movies over the past few years that thought would really move me or that I might one day call my favorite of all time, but they've all fallen far short of The Shawshank Redemption. So, if you have yet to see this movie, please run to the video store immediately. You're guaranteed to find it in the employee picks section. And if it isn't in that section, then you should tell the employees there that there is something seriously wrong with them. If you have seen this movie, go see it again. If you haven't bought your own copy yet, buy one. In fact buy two, and put one in a fire-proof safe, just in case of an emergency. o) So, you want a 1-10 rating??? I give it a 13!!!!!!

Sinatra is the standout of the film, Joey was more cynical in the original stage version but Sinatra still brings a caddish persona and does so with great charm and energy. And of course his singing is divine, of the mellow and rich kind- most lovely to listen to- and with great circular breathing technique. Hayworth is not at her best but she is still breathtakingly beautiful, one of the most beautiful actresses on film, and sassy. And the songs are great, Pal Joey like most Richard Rodgers scores is one of those musicals where every song works but Lady is a Tramp is a real standout here. Sinatra, Hayworth and the songs are not the only things to enjoy. Pal Joey also has opulent production values, Hayworth's figure-hugging dresses are to die for, fluid photography, George Sidney's enigmatic and not heavy-handed direction, a witty script, a charming if watered-down story and smart energetic choreography. For this viewer the only things that came across as flaws were the out-of-kilter happy ending and while beautiful Kim Novak's performance is rather pallid. All in all, a very good underrated film. 8\/10 Bethany Cox ","genre":null},{"date":"25 September 2013","score":"","review":" Anybody who loves Frank Sinatra, Rita Hayworth and Richard Rodgers will be in their element here.

The rich farmer (Sam Shepard) falls for Abby, which Bill encourages because he has learned the farmer doesn't have long to live. Bill tells Abby to marry him, let him die, and we'll be rich. Abby reluctantly plays along, but the scam ends up costing Bill and Abby more than they bargained for.The film works as a yin-yang balancing act of remarkable contrasts. It's grand and epic in scope, yet clocks in at under 94 minutes. It's very expressive in dealing with emotions of yearning and jealousy, yet the dialogue is always sparse and clipped. You seem lost in shots of endless horizons, yet the characters' destinies seem as locked and finite as those of mice in a maze.Terrence Malick seems to have pulled this one out of the editing room, taking a hatchet to his own script. In one of the extras to the fine Criterion DVD, Gere speaks of his frustration at how much of his character's dialogue didn't make the final cut. My sense is Malick realized in editing that the story didn't need much explanation, that less would indeed be more, with the only extended talk coming from Manz's eerie, excellent voice-over narration.The miracle of this movie is that indeed turns out to be enough. Malick seemed to pioneer a style of filmmaking here, of ends of conversations and single-look shots doing all the exposition work. For example, we know Shepard's farmer is having doubts about Abby and Bill with just a shot of him standing alone and still on the roof of his great house, a windmill spinning behind him.This doesn't always work. The opening, while hypnotic and graceful, errs too much on the side of economy. We don't know what happens with Bill's job at the mill, except that he strikes the foreman in anger. It's only reading synopses here that you learn the foreman was killed, which is why Bill is on the run. The ending strangely meanders to the point the entire last five minutes seem like a shrug and a mistake.Also, I don't think Gere or Adams are the best actors for their roles. They are good, but they seem almost like locusts pulled in the slipstream of Manz's powerhouse performance as the little girl, who is alive to every moment she's on screen.As long as you're around, you should have it nice, she tells us, putting everything in perspective while revealing the limited visions of the main characters.I don't which of the two cinematographers, the credited Nestor Almendros or Haskell Wexler, got which shot, but the painterly canvases they produce give Days Of Heaven both a majesty and an accessibility. You can jump into any scene, and just lose five minutes marveling at that and how they keep topping themselves thereafter.Does the film suffer for this? Not really, because it presents us with a good, tight story told not only with economy but an irony that is almost comic in its ersatz divinity. People want what they can't have, and suffer for it. It's Biblical, and kind of existential at the same time. Like I say, it's a yin-yang kind of film.
