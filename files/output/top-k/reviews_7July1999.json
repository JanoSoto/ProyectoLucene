You could say it's vile, disgusting, and offensive. I can't say that, though, because I didn't find it any of those things.  Actually, I'm having trouble defining it period, as I am still a little overwhelmed by it. At the moment, I can say it is by far the funniest movie I have ever seen.The comparisons to 'There's Something about Mary' are relevant only because it brings you a new style of filmmaking, bringing you humorous after humorous moment. There are several kinds of brilliant films; ones that make you cry, ones that make you yelp and scream; ones that leave you feeling like you just had sex and the ones that make you laugh uncontrollably.'Pie' fits into the last two categories, no pun intended for the sex feeling. Maybe it's me, but when I left the theatre, I ran home. It was playing with Notting Hill, which I discarded for the opportunity to play preacher and call on everyone I knew, telling them to go to 'Pie'. The movie made has put a feeling of light-chested-ness in my body that hasn't gone away. The movie is just that good.The movie is this good because of the script. Like every single movie, a script is the end all of the sucsess of it. The 'Pie' script is like nothing you could expect, there has been nothing like it before. There have been comparisons to the John Hughes' and Porkey's films, but beyond the intial premise it is inaccurate. Because of the flexibility of the censors, and how much society is now accustom to, 'Pie' sets new standards and again stretches the lines of censorship. Porkey's' and Hughes' films were made to be somewhat innocent. It apologizes for being racey. 'Pie' makes doesn't offer you one, and instead asks for one because you doubted it before you got in there.The next most important element of a good film is the actors. In all of the great films, we rememeber the actors just as much as the plot and the setting. Jason Biggs, the lead character, and our protagonist because he's always a loser, is dead-on. He plays Jake to the last detail; the shy guy in everybody's class. Chris Klien, who shone in Election, again shines here as a wanna-be sensitive jock.  He commands such an aura, and easily gains sympathy and respect from viewers. The female actors are lead by a band geek Alyson Hannigan and Sex Therapist Natasha Lyonne. A somewhat rookie actress, Mena Suvari, plays a jazz ensemble goodie-two-shoes and interest of Klien.  She is absolutely intoxicating, and her looks, even though she is not as attractive as Tara Reid or Shannon Elizabeth(both in the film, as Vicky and Nadia respectfully), draws people, at least me, to develop a crush on here. Lastly, Eugene Levy, the SCTV vetreran, brings a character to life that we can all say 'Hey, that's my dad!', in one scene or another.You could talk about the style of shooting, and other production notes, but unlike 'Saving Private Ryan', it is not important. The movie is meant to make you laugh. You are supposed to be impressed because it is so funny, not  because you have learned something. The movie accomplishes this like Michael Jordan wins. It deserves kudos until there is no more kudos.Like Phantom Menace, go in with an open mind. Adam Herz, Paul and Chris Weitz, Jason Biggs, Chris Klien and Mena Suvari. Remember those names, as you will try so hard to forget this movie, but fail, because it so good.I guess I found something after all to say.

I remember films like Fast Times and Mischief and Secret Admirer and Porky's.  They were funny and they looked at high school with a more sexual themed story.

Because when it comes down to it, high school is a time when most people find out how amazing sex is.  It is the first time they start to discover their bodies and it is the first time they actually make a concerted effort to get laid.

Normally a standard movie with pretty good acting, directing, story, music, dialogue, etc., is about two and a half stars. What adds let's say another two and a half stars to make it great is extra aspects and special touches, a spark of originality, or a bit of unique entertainment. Unfortunately, with Wild Wild West, we have most off the latter, in a moderate degree, but not much of the former. The original 1960s spy spoof Wild Wild West is a great piece of classic TV history and Americana, and this new movie suprisingly does a good job of being faithful to its source. Jim West as a black man is fine, and Will Smith does okay. He is a very charismatic actor, who can carry just about anything, and is the best thing about this movie. But here's the bad news this is his worst movie yet, and his worst performance. Never has he been so lazy in his wisecracking strut, and never has he had such a large volume of bad one-liners. Kevin Kline is okay as Artemis Gordon, and Kenneth Branagh is also all right, hamming it up as the legless Dr. Arliss Loveless. Salma Hayek has a pathetic and retarded little role designed simply to flash her butt-cheeks a couple times, and all the other supporting characters aren't much better, except for Loveless female cohorts. The direction, cinematography, and editing were decent, but they weren't able to make you excited or gripped at all by the action. The script had some clever bits (like the double-entendre banter between Loveless and West), but overall it wasn't that funny.The sci-fi technology is appealing, but the sets and desert CGI looked pretty fake, and the brief parts we see of the Old West look like an underpopulated group of actors in costumes on soundstages. The movie just wasn't realistic, or grounded in any kind of reality. This isn't because of the bizarre goings-on, Men In Black was a great effort from Sonnenfeld and Smith, and was everything this movie isn't. They had a great concept, they started out good and quite promising (loved the opening credits), but tripped shortly into it, and skidded the rest of the movie until it slowed to a stop at the ridiculous and dumb ending. Maybe I would have been less objective if I saw it with a big crowd, but my Thursday night 930 showing had about 35-40 people in it, who were largely silent-a bad sign. The guy who said this was 100 times better then Star Wars is a proven plant from Warner Bros., so ignore him. If we had taken time to get to know the characters, and believe the story and surrounding, instead of being forced to accept because it's there, it would have been a lot better. They messed up big time, and I suggest waiting until the dollar theater, or better yet, video, where you will enjoy it a lot more.For those of you who still doubt, I'm a teenaged guy who is very forgiving. I thought Godzilla, The Avengers, and Wing Commander weren't that bad (the latter being the best of the bunch, and the two former being okay, but lacking and disappointing.)

Normally a standard movie with pretty good acting, directing, story, music, dialogue, etc., is about two and a half stars. What adds let's say another two and a half stars to make it great is extra aspects and special touches, a spark of originality, or a bit of unique entertainment. Unfortunately, with Wild Wild West, we have most off the latter, in a moderate degree, but not much of the former. The original 1960s spy spoof Wild Wild West is a great piece of classic TV history and Americana, and this new movie suprisingly does a good job of being faithful to its source. Jim West as a black man is fine, and Will Smith does okay. He is a very charismatic actor, who can carry just about anything, and is the best thing about this movie. But here's the bad news this is his worst movie yet, and his worst performance. Never has he been so lazy in his wisecracking strut, and never has he had such a large volume of bad one-liners. Kevin Kline is okay as Artemis Gordon, and Kenneth Branagh is also all right, hamming it up as the legless Dr. Arliss Loveless. Salma Hayek has a pathetic and retarded little role designed simply to flash her butt-cheeks a couple times, and all the other supporting characters aren't much better, except for Loveless female cohorts. The direction, cinematography, and editing were decent, but they weren't able to make you excited or gripped at all by the action. The script had some clever bits (like the double-entendre banter between Loveless and West), but overall it wasn't that funny.The sci-fi technology is appealing, but the sets and desert CGI looked pretty fake, and the brief parts we see of the Old West look like an underpopulated group of actors in costumes on soundstages. The movie just wasn't realistic, or grounded in any kind of reality. This isn't because of the bizarre goings-on, Men In Black was a great effort from Sonnenfeld and Smith, and was everything this movie isn't. They had a great concept, they started out good and quite promising (loved the opening credits), but tripped shortly into it, and skidded the rest of the movie until it slowed to a stop at the ridiculous and dumb ending. Maybe I would have been less objective if I saw it with a big crowd, but my Thursday night 930 showing had about 35-40 people in it, who were largely silent-a bad sign. The guy who said this was 100 times better then Star Wars is a proven plant from Warner Bros., so ignore him. If we had taken time to get to know the characters, and believe the story and surrounding, instead of being forced to accept because it's there, it would have been a lot better. They messed up big time, and I suggest waiting until the dollar theater, or better yet, video, where you will enjoy it a lot more.For those of you who still doubt, I'm a teenaged guy who is very forgiving. I thought Godzilla, The Avengers, and Wing Commander weren't that bad (the latter being the best of the bunch, and the two former being okay, but lacking and disappointing.)

Unfortunately the intricate plot enveloping this tale was evidently too large for director Alan Pakula to handle. Pakula did manage to make this film suspenseful, but the lack of continuity within the plot brought the mounting tension to peaks of unintentional humor.At one point the reporter Gray Grantham (Denzel Washington) is running from the very man he's desperately searching for. Then that evening (or so it seems) Gray is solemnly talking to the man's widow and we learn that her husband has been dead for two weeks. Go figure.Another time Gray is standing shirtless at night in front of a secret, secluded cabin with a rifle in his hands. From the eerie noises moving through the dense surrounding forest its seems Gray is about to get shot right in his magnificently bulging chest. But no. It is only the heroine, Darby Shaw (Julia Roberts), slipping and sliding through the muck trying to get to his hideout. What a let down. I do remember laughing at that point. And by the way. How was she able to find him, and the super clever bad guys couldn't?Speaking of clever bad guys. After seeing the same two bad guys take turns attempting to terminate Gray and Darby, suddenly there's a girl bad guy chasing our breathless duo. Where did she come from? In a very tense moment she has the two cornered and spots their reflection in the shiny chrome of a nearby car. Since they are crouched motionless behind a wall looking toward the chrome on the car, and the female assassin has to move toward them, I would have thought they would spot her reflection far sooner than she theirs. How do they get out of this one? Oh yes. A Doberman, conveniently sitting with the window half rolled down in the car next to the assassiness, decides to get excited just at the right moment. I sort of felt like Max in Get Smart. The old Doberman in the adjacent car trick I can hear him say.If you like tension, and more than the occasional hackneyed getaway ploy, you'll love this movie.

It is uplifing, well made, well directed, well acted, well scored and well, it is  well  everything.  This is the movie that started one of the greatest heroes and greatest careers in the history of Hollywood.  And it proves that in life and on the screen if you want something bad enough, you have to go out and take it, because no one is going to give it to you.  To tell you what this film is about and then give a small critique is rather pointless.  We all know about Rocky.  And my review is not going to do anything to enhance your like or dislike of the film.  By now, you either like the character or you don't.  You like Stallone or you don't.  So judge for yourself if this film is good or not.  I personally think it is great.  But for me this was much more than a film.  This is much more than a metaphor about life.  To me, this is a Bible for anyone who has a dream.Stallone put his life on the line to get this movie made.  He believed in himself and he believed in what he had to say.  He was offered a huge amount of money to sell the film and let someone else play Rocky.  He held out and told them that he wanted the title role and even though at the time his wife was pregnant, they had very little money and he was hanging by a thread, he took that stand.  And the rest is history.  Could you imagine anyone else in that role now?  Does anyone really fit the mold that Stallone made for us? No.  And this film inspires me to be more than I am.  It inspires the dreamer in all of us to go for what we want and damn the consequences.  If I ever meet Stallone one day, I will personally thank him for making this film.  It changed my life forever and gave me hope to make my dream come true.  Rocky didn't stop until his dream came true and neither did Stallone. Why should I?  Why should anyone?

Unfortunately, this movie does not live up to the standard set by its predecessor.The movie suffers chiefly from careless plot development.  The action occurs as a series of in-your-face explosions and reckless destruction.  What occurs is almost a series of disconnected incidents, only peripherally related to the plot.  There was little attempt to think through the action and organize it around a recognizable plot. The action, therefore, lacks depth and structure, unlike the original series.In the original series, there was a very palpable antagonism between West and Gordon and Dr. Miguelito Loveless, their constant nemesis. The series flourished upon the permutations of the personal conflict between the characters, and more importantly, that character development was center stage.  It was what made Dr. Loveless a character the audience loved to hate  an archvillain.Dr. Arliss Loveless, as he's called in the movie, has been carried away by the global nature of his ambitions, ambitions that were tongue in cheek in the original series.  Arliss Loveless is a megalomaniac bent upon destroying everything in sight with little or no provocation fo doing so.  The only relationship he has to West and Gordon is a vague if recurring reference to a long ago battle in which he is said to have killed Major West's parents.  Now, West would like nothing better than to destroy Loveless, and of course, the feeling has always been mutual.Destructive power and ambition were never the point to make about the original Dr. Loveless.  It was his diabolical, archfiendish cleverness in getting West and Gordon into impossible situations, situations which required just as much ingenuity to escape that made Loveless an ironically likable character.  He could be an anti-hero for the anti-social set or just those who hate intrusive government agencies.I agree with a reviewer, whose name escapes me, who felt that Kenneth Branagh's considerable talents as an actor were wasted in this movie. Mr. Branagh suffers not from bad acting, but from bad direction here.The other actors are similarly miscast.  Will Smith plays Major West a little too flamboyantly than he should.  Salma Hayek is a very beautiful woman with some talent as an actress, but her presence adds little to this film.  She isn't saved by West and Gordon and she doesn't save them from villainy.  She is peripheral to the plot as it unfolds and she is peripheral, as a character, to West and Gordon.  She is not even their love interest and she should have been spared any involvement with this movie.  She has acted better roles than this.  Barry Sonnenberg appears to have thought that, since audiences went for the flamboyant style in Men In Black, the same formula would work here.  But the entire production has an overwrought quality that serves mainly as a publicity venture for the actors.  It lacks the depth required to give it the faintest resemblance to the original series.Wild Wild West will appeal to those who don't like to analyze what they are watching, or who don't expect a movie to have a deep impact upon them psychologically or emotionally.  Kids should like it for its special effects and overblown action sequences, especially kids in the 9-12 age range.  But for those who want a movie to be faithful in large part to the original subject matter upon which it is based or who just want to be impressed by a movie, this is not the movie they are looking for.I give this movie one and a half stars.

Did they want something vulgar? Well, if so, they wont get it with this film!I give this film an A+.

Like almost everyone else who has said something about this film, somebody associated with Striptease forgot to tell Demi Moore that this was a comedy.  She probably thought we(the audience) cared about the trials and tribulations of a single mother.  We didn't. This could have been a good Elmore Leonard-style comedy about lowlife scum in Florida, but Moore ruins the movie by thinking this was a drama.  Burt Reynolds and Ving Rhames almost save the movie with some good screwball performances, but the screwiest of all is Demi.  It's amazing how her blandness sucks the energy down in every scene she's in(which is to say, the whole movie). I would have paid seven bucks to see the movie if it would have been a real comedy, but instead I shelled out two-fifty at Mr. Movies for a gander at Demi's boobs.  I wonder if the producers are questioning now which approach to the film would have gotten them more money.

How can one go from making the following movies Halloween Escape From New York The Thing Star Man Big Trouble in Little China, to stuff like ----- Village of the Damned ------- and this, possibly his worst movie - Escape from LA.Escape from LA is really just a half-hearted remake of Carpenter's original 1981 effort, but while the original managed to be extremely entertaining, this movie just falls apart at the seems.The film had even less plot than the first movie and you could see the cast really were squirming with each banal line of dialogue. As for the action, it manages to be so stupid in its execution that you could be forgiven for thinking this was a comedy - well, maybe that's what the cast thought???I recommend you miss LA and watch the far superior original (NY). It's hard to believe how far this director has fallen. I really hope Carpenter manages to get out of this streak of bad movies he has made, because we all know he can make great movies...Escape from LA is unfortunately an extremely bad one.2\/10.
