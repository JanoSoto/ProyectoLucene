This is correct.  Only a very few of the main fright points are done in Jaws style, i.e., sprung upon us when we can't  help but be off-guard.  Still, in my view, this doesn't detract much. This a VERY scary movie and a good investment if you like shock and surprise.  I definitely *wouldn't* advise seeing it while holding a hot coffee or a fragile dessert.That's not to say there's nothing in this film that detracts.  First, what talent Michelle Pfeiffer has is largely wasted during the first hour on a script that's way too full of boomer-angst cliches.  A big piece of the film's first half -- showing her character's daughter leaving for college and mom's resulting slushy reaction -- could  have been easily condensed or evaporated, trimming several minutes  from the total 129.  If this was there to demonstrate what a good  friend of mine likes to call EMS (Excessive Mom Syndrome) and to help confirm the idea that ole mom is even more delicate than she looks,  then I suppose it worked.  But so did several other shorter & simpler scenes, which sufficed.  (At one point I heard a Valley-Girl sort of voice in the row behind me mutter, after a heavy sigh Okaaaaay, so she's wound a little too tight, we've *got* that already....  It was an accurate point.  Somebody please wake me when this stock character type -- the artsy, wispy, idle, tormented, 40-ish upper-middle-class housewife with white teeth and a whiter Volvo -- breathes its last.Some comments have also noted considerable over- and under-acting by both Ford and Pfeiffer.  I agree.  The mix of super-calm moments and shocker scenes, while effective, is jarringly uneven.  I don't mean  to imply that a horror\/thriller film should always jolt us only at  neat and regularly spaced intervals; but one could almost wonder if this film was divided into several parts at the beginning, each then being assigned to a separate director who rarely spoke with his or  her collaborators.  That said, I can't fault the *intensity* of any  of the several pee-in-your-pants moments.  As predictable and hollow as many of them are, each is a definite seat-grabber, and it would be hard to spoil any of them, even with a detailed verbal description.The often-noted similarities to Rear Window are obvious, even too obvious, but *not* essential to the plot and in retrospect may seem gratuitous. Again, while the film may keep your mind engrossed and your breathing shallow, the overkill factor is high.  Some of the  camera or editing work seems overdone in the same way -- sometimes almost playfully so, and to such an extent that I can't really say for sure if the performers are guiltier there than the director.For example, at one point about halfway through, a progressively more unnerved Claire Pfeiffer is inside her home peering intently at her neighbor's house, which we see in the predictable breathless pan from window to window, supposedly through her binoculars.  When she finally sights Thorwald -- ooooooooops, I mean her neighbor Warren Feur -- we of *course* see his scowling face in a lightning-zoomed close-up with a loud blast of eerie music.  and while this isn't done quite as badly as, say, the Large Marge eyeball-popper scene in Pee-wee Herman's Big Adventure, it's in the same class when it comes to timing & soundtrack!  It's quite a scary moment, but you might easily feel cheated by it soon afterward because (1) you realize that the zoom is a major part of what made the shot so scary, and (2) this Feur guy isn't really involved in the plot except to affirm, yet again, that Claire's a borderline basket case.Miscellany  The film is set in Vermont, where I once lived, and I was pleased with some of the accuracies while also struck by some inaccuracies or improbabilities.  None are really worth mentioning, except for the repeated mentions of the town of Adamant.  Adamant is a real  place in Vermont, but it's referred to at least twice in the script as being down seven, meaning south on U.S. Highway 7 -- a main north-south thoroughfare, running the length of Vermont's western edge and traversing the Burlington\/Lake Champlain area where the film's characters obviously live. But Adamant lies some 40 miles EAST of Route 7, a little over halfway across the state.  It can't realistically be described as down seven from anywhere else in in Vermont or even Quebec, and in fact does not lie astride *any* numbered highway.  (If the multiple mentions of this town's name  are a new kind of product placement technique, I'd be interested to know the rationale for so thoroughly mislocating it!)What happens *in* Adamant does have some bearing on the plot, but  the town itself is not significant, or at least not significant  enough to justify its quirky repetition.  (If I missed something about this while making a quick visit to the john, someone please  clue me in.)Special effects  Not many, but those that we do see are quite good.

The scene where she first has contractions (in the Wal-mart bathroom with the little girl nearby) was terrible!  Novalee was supposed to be in at least a _little_ pain, but all Portman does is say Aaaah twice at a normal conversational volume.  Patently unconvincing.  And I don't think any of the other actors will be winning any awards either.All the movie's advertising harped on the problems that Novalee would have raising the child.  When it's clear that the child will have a happy home about 1\/3 through the movie, it's the movie that is having the problems, the first of which is the incredible ease with which Novalee recovers from the abandonment(about 15 minutes of movie time).  Most of the rest of the scenes manage to move the timeline along without advancing the plot.   Americus, the child, has only marginal importance in the second half of the movie.  (and who the heck thought of Americus and Novalee's reasoning behind the name?  Aya!)  It seems like the writers had difficulty trying to make a story long enough for a movie.

To generate some suspense, Novalee of course has to leave the shelter when the tornado is 10 m away, and nearly get sucked into the twister.

Yet, she and Forney also have sex before she is willing to be committed, and this intercourse is viewed positively (I guess since they are together at the end).  So it's not smart to have sex outside of marriage except if it's to someone you like but won't see again?To sum up, the movie is a patchwork of scenes that are mostly uncoordinated and irrelevant.

The detective scenes are as smartly done as those in Se7en, and the dream scape inside the killers' mind scenes are as strange and beautiful as a well-directed NIN or Marilyn Manson video. After watching it for the second time (it's that type of movie), I was struck by how seriously it took its subject matter. There really aren't any light moments in it, but I wasn't bothered by its tone, and I wouldn't call it pretentious,  I was simply fascinated by its energy and endless imagination. I hope that the unusual visuals and slightly bent storyline doesn't scare audiences away. It's a wonderful film and it deserves to be seen, just try not spend the whole movie trying to decipher its images. The bare bones of the plot is easy to follow, but you can go mad while trying to figure out the significance of certain scenes. Save that for the second viewing.Jennifer Lopez is a star, and she really shines in this one. She's naturally so stunningly beautiful that when you see her in her idealized self inside the mind, it is quite a sight. She's a hottie, I just wish she'd give up the singing and get back to making movies on a regular basis. It's good to see Vince Vaughn in a good movie again (Psycho still leaving a bad taste in my mouth). This guy has a lot of potential, he just needs to be in the right projects.

That said, I would like to comment on the movie.  Despite its propaganda, its EXTREME unoriginality, as well as its predictable plot, the movie is entertaining, and a good killer of 2 hours.We have seen enough Die Hard rip-offs since 1988.  This movie does nothing less than take the plot as well as elements from that movie.  For example, the ending In Die Hard, Gruber (our villain) had Holly (our hero's wife) at the edge of the building and was going to do something.  McClane (our hero) somehow kills Gruber and rescues his wife.  In AFO, Gary Oldman (our villain) had Wendy (hero's wife) at the parachute ramp at the rear of the plane.  Marshall (our hero) kills Oldman and rescues his wife in almost the same fashion as in Die Hard.  AFO included the taking of a hostage by the bad guys and using him or her to get the unknown hero to show himself. Like we haven't seen that before.  Then you can expect the hero, which for some strange reason happens to be the President of the United States (what the hell?), to make everything turn out fine in the end.Also, this movie makes the terrorists look bad,  yet I was rooting for them throughout the movie.  It's strange how when a non-American sacrifices the security of civilians to achieve certain aims he is labeled a terrorist, yet an American who does the same thing is a hero.  This movie is chock-full of that kind of propaganda.  Don't expect the President to ever get seriously injured, either, because he's the President of the United States.  Oh, and make sure to keep your brain in a safe place other than your head, because you won't be needing it for the duration of this movie.Don't expect any plot twists.  That traitor guy (I didn't bother remembering his name) should've been kept secret until the end in order to add some suspense.

It's true that this is a rather long movie, so how will you decide whether it's worth a three hour time investment? It's not for everybody, no doubt, so let me make the following suggestions so you can decide whether or not Magnolia will win your heart (as it did mine).I will start off by saying that Short Cuts is my favorite movie. If you liked Short Cuts then you are very likely to appreciate this movie as well. If you hated Short Cuts, then there's probably little in this movie that will win you over.The whole of Magnolia is greater than the sum of its parts. The story is actually several stories which on the surface are unrelated. As the movie progresses, it becomes more apparent that the characters of the individual stories are all intertwined. They interact between stories. The major player of one story unpredictably becomes a motive force in another, seemingly unrelated story. So what you end up with is a character study where the impact of a given action is felt by every person, and not just by the person most directly involved. Likewise, it is interesting to see how different characters with different motives and in different situations react to a shared reality. What starts as a series of unrelated vignettes concludes three hours later as a cohesive story. With this as the premise, you might (correctly) suspect that this is not really light fare. Some thought is actually required (perhaps provoked would be the better term?)This is the same structural approach that Short Cuts used so successfully. The similarity ends here. Where Short Cuts focuses on the interactions of ordinary people in ordinary (well, comparatively ordinary) situations, most of Magnolia's characters don't live on your street. Rather, Magnolia is filled with extreme and superhuman characters the child genius, the game show host, the dying Hollywood executive, the how to pick up girls motivational speaker, the christian cop, the man who was struck by lightning, the coke-snorting emotionally-unbalanced girl... As such, the conditions of the characters' existence are more extreme, and less realistic. The unfolding stories, the interactions... they are highly improbable and far fetched. However, this feeds right into the important reccurring theme of the movie, which is synchronicity, and the point at which things become SO coincidental that they appear destined or fated. Sound like fun to you?Technically, Magnolia is very precise and well thought out. I'd suspect that Mr. Anderson is quite the control freak, but the effect is spectacular. Details such as the hidden magnolia references and the portentous bible verse keep coming back. You will only appreciate them in retrospect. Likewise, Magnolia is an acting tour de force. I dare you not to choke up when Earl Partridge gives his deathbed monologue on the topic of regret. Also, in my opinion this is one of Tom Cruise's finest moments (which caught me off-guard like a sucker punch, since I don't expect much from the man). And the white haired gay man in the bar, sparring with the quiz kid... absolute perfection.Another aspect I appreciated about Magnolia was Anderson's bait and switch strategy provide easy conclusions that later turn out not to be true. I came to the same conclusion as the pharmacist who was suspicious of the woman who had prescriptions for many hard drugs. He was wrong, and so was I. When she told him where to go, she was speaking to me too. Wow, I was so humiliated!If you can't take a potty-mouth, then stay away from Magnolia. I've heard and read several complaints on this issue and I can't really disagree. However, you will find redemption in the fact that one of the characters, the christian police officer, also cannot stand much cussin'.A SPOILER FOLLOWS, ALTHOUGH YOU WON'T RECOGNIZE IT AS A SPOILER UNTIL AFTER YOU'VE SEEN THE FILMThe controversial cathartic event in Magnolia goes over the top in terms of implausibility in a movie in which implausibility is a major theme, and even though I loved Magnolia, I felt that this scene was a bitter pill to swallow (changing my rating from 10 to 9). The mysterious bible verse refers to this phenomenon, as does the phrase on the painting in the coke-head girl's house which the camera pans in on just as the event begins (...but it really happened). This event actually did happen in the United States. It is another of the too-coincidental-to-be-a-coincidence stories, culled from old copies of Ripley's Believe It or Not, presented as a prologue to the movie. It is a documented fact that a tornado once formed and passed over a pond populated by many frogs. The vacuum of the tornado sucked the pond water and the population of frogs high aloft and carried them a distance from the pond. When the tornado dissipated, the pond water and frogs fell to earth. The people living in a nearby town were amazed that day to see a storm which literally rained frogs.

It's true that this is a rather long movie, so how will you decide whether it's worth a three hour time investment? It's not for everybody, no doubt, so let me make the following suggestions so you can decide whether or not Magnolia will win your heart (as it did mine).I will start off by saying that Short Cuts is my favorite movie. If you liked Short Cuts then you are very likely to appreciate this movie as well. If you hated Short Cuts, then there's probably little in this movie that will win you over.The whole of Magnolia is greater than the sum of its parts. The story is actually several stories which on the surface are unrelated. As the movie progresses, it becomes more apparent that the characters of the individual stories are all intertwined. They interact between stories. The major player of one story unpredictably becomes a motive force in another, seemingly unrelated story. So what you end up with is a character study where the impact of a given action is felt by every person, and not just by the person most directly involved. Likewise, it is interesting to see how different characters with different motives and in different situations react to a shared reality. What starts as a series of unrelated vignettes concludes three hours later as a cohesive story. With this as the premise, you might (correctly) suspect that this is not really light fare. Some thought is actually required (perhaps provoked would be the better term?)This is the same structural approach that Short Cuts used so successfully. The similarity ends here. Where Short Cuts focuses on the interactions of ordinary people in ordinary (well, comparatively ordinary) situations, most of Magnolia's characters don't live on your street. Rather, Magnolia is filled with extreme and superhuman characters the child genius, the game show host, the dying Hollywood executive, the how to pick up girls motivational speaker, the christian cop, the man who was struck by lightning, the coke-snorting emotionally-unbalanced girl... As such, the conditions of the characters' existence are more extreme, and less realistic. The unfolding stories, the interactions... they are highly improbable and far fetched. However, this feeds right into the important reccurring theme of the movie, which is synchronicity, and the point at which things become SO coincidental that they appear destined or fated. Sound like fun to you?Technically, Magnolia is very precise and well thought out. I'd suspect that Mr. Anderson is quite the control freak, but the effect is spectacular. Details such as the hidden magnolia references and the portentous bible verse keep coming back. You will only appreciate them in retrospect. Likewise, Magnolia is an acting tour de force. I dare you not to choke up when Earl Partridge gives his deathbed monologue on the topic of regret.

(The BB trailer ran right before the show.) And the trailer sucked me in. It was so tightly edited, so exciting, so ... so enticing. I really wanted to see this movie! And so I did - I'm sorry to say, with a guy I didn't particularly like, one who guffawed and made embarrassing comments regarding the return of certain items of Jake's personal property by the prison guard. Therefore I didn't quite appreciate the flick the first time out, except for the music and dancing. A few years later, when it showed up on cable, my husband and I taped it. We just about wore the tape out. I bought a copy of The Blues Brothers when it was re-released. Unfortunately the sequel (if you can call it that) was about to be released and the first 30 minutes of the tape are devoted to promoting the sequel. No matter. I can fast-forward to the good stuff.Is The Blues Brothers a great film? Of course not. It can't touch Casablanca or Citizen Kane or even some of the Marx Brothers' wackiest turns. But is it a great movie? Oh, my. Better than four fried chickens and a Coke. Better than country AND western. Better than shrimp cocktail in a five-star restaurant. (Well, maybe not that good, but close.) The Blues Brothers has become a movie (like A Christmas Story) that I know so well I can quote it. Or should I say, act it. I have Aretha Franklin's, They still owe you money, FOOL! dead-on. I watch it today with a sense of melancholy. John Belushi was so talented. He had so much promise. Too bad he viewed life more as the brawling car chase than the mission from God. He could have been a contender. What a tragedy, and what a waste. No wonder the sequel didn't work. He wasn't there to toss the cigarette lighter out the car window.But we still have the original Blues Brothers romp, with its Orange Whip (every tried to drink that stuff?), dry white toast, wine served by a waiter who grew up to be Pee-Wee Herman and other visual, aural and gustatory delights.And it certainly had a heck of a trailer, too.
