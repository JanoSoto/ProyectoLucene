After all, what kind of person doesn't laugh at a man firing hot waves of watery excrement out of his horrorstruck anus, or at a blind boy stroking a decapitated bird, or at an owl being shot by a cork? These are all things that should appeal to any right-minded individual &#150; it's comedy at its basest, but the funny bone should never be concerned with good taste.Of all the gags and silly lines in Dumber and Dumber, my favourite moment actually involves attempted male rape (always a prime source for comedy!). The moment I'm talking about is when Sea Bass very nearly forces himself on one of our heroes. But one of the things I love most about the scene is Lloyd's fascination when reading the message on the toilet wall. 'For manly love be here March 25th at 215am sharp' it reads. Lloyd looks amused, even a little bit curious, but then as he consults his watch you hear a 'Wah-wah' on the soundtrack, which translates into 'you're about to get buggered' and the smile on his face vanishes. Wonderful stuff.But the character of Sea Bass himself is just bloody hilarious (even if he only has two scenes and hardly says anything). I could easily watch an entire film devoted to him and his sour-faced, bad tempered homosexual antics. But as it stands we only get him spitting into a burger and him trying to molest someone. But that's enough, I guess. However, there is another great Sea Bass moment. Just watch Sea Bass when Lloyd and Harry are trying to scam him. The way he points to himself and his 'boys' never fails to crack me up.Another supporting character rich in comedy is Mental the gangster. He has quite a few amusing moments, but the best one by quite some margin is when his phone conversation in a phone booth is interrupted by some bespectacled nitwit. The man is so geeky and so annoying that the punch that comes thundering through the glass not only induces laughs but also elicits cheers &#150; you can't help but like this bloke. However, as likable as this mentalist is, die he must. And his death scene includes some of Carey's and Daniels' best acting. Just look at them when they spike Mental's burger. They're like kids &#150; they can't suppress their mirth.Speaking of acting, it's not a surprise that Carey is so good at acting dumb, but it's something of a minor revelation that Daniels is so good at comedy. After all, before this, he was known for more serious roles. But here Daniels' allows his IQ to plummet and he more than holds his own with his more experienced counterpart.One of the most enjoyable things about Dumb and Dumber is how petty and bad tempered the two friends are ('You are one pathetic loser&#133;no offence') &#150; some of the best scenes are the ones where they argue like school kids. A great scene happens near the end &#150; Lloyd and Harry are arguing over Mary. They no longer want to be friends and Harry asks him where he has to sign. 'Right on my ass after you kiss it!' And I can't help but crack up at Lloyd's shooting fantasy when he sees Mary's husband. Both characters are borderline psychotic, which only makes the film even funnier.I also like how relentlessly horny Lloyd is. Just take the scene when he first meets Mary. The quasi-romantic music and the way Lloyd grabs his heart when Mary walks back into her house are bloody hilarious, as is the 'Goodbye, my love!' moment at the airport (also note Lloyd's reaction when he hugs his 'love' &#150; the groan as he relaxes his body is disturbingly sexual). And I've also just remembered the 'Be strong' moment and the little sobbing sound he makes (man this film is funny!). But just as good as this is Lloyd's daydream as he drives. The way he sneaks a look at Mary's butt is priceless (and what a butt it is, too!). And then the schmoozing at his dinner party (if only lighted farts really did impress people at 'sophisticated' parties) and the fight at the restaurant. But although the fisticuffs are brilliant, there's a much smaller and funnier moment in this scene &#150; note the way the waiter chucks Lloyd's plate onto the table and the way he carefully places Mary's; who says the film isn't subtle? But even though there are one or two gags which can rightly be declared as subtle, they kind of pale in comparison to the instances of bad taste. Just take the officer drinking his own urine ('give me the booze you pumpkin pie haircutted freak!') or Harry crapping his brains out. These are the showcase moments. But as good as these are, what keeps me coming back are the little things &#150; Lloyd trying to buy a copy of 'Rhode Island Slut', Lloyd gagging when he sees his best friend hanging out with his 'girl', the 'big gulps' moment, the look on Harry's face when he finds out that his best friend has been wearing extra gloves and Lloyd burping in utter contempt when he gets stuck next to an insufferable woman at a bar.

One can tell that Hitchcock might be reaching at times to get commercial appeal, even more than usual with his films of the 50s (and after Vertigo and before Psycho, he's trying to make up for what he thought of as lost ground at the box office frankly). But it's all the same a ballsy commercial entertainment that still hails high above the ranks of today's proficient but soulless demonstrations of panache with archetypal heroes and villains in double-cross moves. Thornhill (Cary Grant) is an advertising man who gets the typical-Hitchcock 'wrong-man' scenario, and as typical too involving a) spies, b) government espionage with the all-popular 'MacGuffin', and c) a blonde leading lady with her own issues to deal with in the middle of the men. The villains in this case are the very calm and collected James Mason and his leering henchman Martin Landau, as a quasi-chase develops across the country all over George Kaplan- who, by the way, doesn't really exist.The plot, to be sure, is cobbled together under Ernest Lehman's attempts to put together something that Hitchcock would respond to and, more crucially, afford him his two favorite pastimes first is the witty, very knowing, practically self-conscious dialog meant exclusively to lighten potentially clichéd territory and give grins to others; the scenes with Grant and Saint in the train car, trading off innuendo, is one scene that over-steps the problematic territory, in general their chemistry is elevated thanks to Lehamn's snappy, amusing words. There's even a great bit provided by Thornhill's mother, played by Jessie Royce Landis, as one of Hitchcock's older who smirk things like You gentlemen aren't REALLY trying to kill my son, are you? The other pastime are absurd but completely wonderful sequences where a character or characters get pitted against larger-than-life odds. The hallmark crop-duster scene was the one I had seen even before the whole film, in a class where the sequence was broken down; this, along with Psycho's shower scene, make up some of the most accomplished executions of storyboarding, and how timing and details of the figures in a shot, and the intensity or lack thereof, that Hitchcock's ever done. The Mount Rushmore climax- save for what happens to Grant and Saint following the cliffhanger moment, which is my least favorite part of the movie- is also stellar, including what precedes it in the hideout.North by Northwest is essential viewing, but is it really a completely devastating triumph like Hitchcock at the peak of his powers? Not exactly, as there's some moments where it feels like Hitchcock on auto-pilot with some of the twists and preposterous turns, and he's really more into his suspense scenes and getting Grant perfect in these scenes more than anything else. There's also not much depth to the whole process, yet that's part of its appeal as a yarn of an adventure story. But as a suspense-comedy, it's a work of big-studio success, as Grant comes off on note in every scene he's in, and helps make even the smaller, supporting actors seem important in the grand scheme of the story. In a way it's a great Hitchcock film in the sense that you can just curb the usual logic at the door and just hop along for the ride, and it's in this that North by Northwest should always be remembered (alongside the Bernard Herrmann score, one of his best).

His friends and colleagues are a group of people with little or not connection between them but we follow them as they come together and collide as they all wake up and get through the day to the party.Opening with the title sequence of the movie within this movie, Full Frontal starts out just as disjointed as it continues. Those looking for more than a collection of individually entertaining and interesting scenes should avoid because the film never once stands together as a whole. Instead the film jumps around in space, time, film stock and approach and delivers a patchwork quilt of a movie. As a result some of it works and is interesting while other parts are just annoying and out of place. It is all a folly and, like others have said, it is a bit like a Hollywood home movie, with Soderbergh given too much freedom to do whatever he wants and letting it all go to pot as a result.The all-star cast are perhaps interesting enough to be worth a look and they do all provide some interest. Keener is brilliant as ever; Pierce is good; Underwood is reasonably good. Roberts wears lots of different hairstyles while Duchovny and Katt provide good side turns. Cameos include Pitt, Fincher, Oh, Jones, Stamp and Soderbergh himself. Mostly all the cast do well and it is not their fault that the film is as disjointed as it is then.Overall then, worth seeing for what it is &#150; a disjointed collection of ideas and scenes with some good dialogue delivered by an all-star cast.

Smokey and the Bandit is a 1977 movie starring Burt Reynolds, Sally Field, Jackie Gleason, Jerry Reed, Pat McCormick, Paul Williams, and Mike Henry. It inspired several other trucking films, including two sequels, Smokey and the Bandit II (originally known as Smokey and the Bandit Ride Again in the U.K.), and Smokey and the Bandit Part 3. There were also a series of 1994 television movies (Bandit Goes Country,, Beauty and the Bandit and Bandit's Silver Angel) from original director\/writer Hal Needham loosely based on the earlier version, with Emmy-winning actor Brian Bloom now playing Bandit. The three original movies introduced two generations of the Pontiac Trans Am (while the TV-movie version drives the Dodge Stealth). The film was the second highest grossing film of 1977, beaten only by Star Wars..SUMMARY As the movie begins, rich Texan Big Enos Burdette (Pat McCormick) and his son, Little Enos (Paul Williams), are trying to find a truck driver willing to haul Coors beer to Georgia for their refreshment. Unfortunately, due to federal liquor laws and state liquor tax regulations of the time, selling and\/or shipping Coors east of the Mississippi River was considered bootlegging, and the truck drivers who had taken the bet previously had been discovered and arrested by Smokey (truck driver and CB slang for highway patrolmen). At a local truck rodeo, the Texans locate legendary truck driver Bo Bandit Darville (Burt Reynolds) and offer him US$80,000 (US$270,000 in 2007 dollars), the price of a new truck, to haul 400 cases of Coors beer from Texarkana, Texas to the Southern Classic truck rodeo in Georgia&#x97; in 28 hours. Bandit accepts the bet and recruits fellow trucker Cletus Snowman Snow (Jerry Reed) to drive the truck (Snow brings along his dog, a Basset Hound named Fred, for company). Bandit purchases a black Pontiac Trans Am, which he will drive himself as a blocker car to deflect attention away from the truck and its cargo. The trio reaches Texas ahead of schedule, load their truck with Coors, and immediately head back towards Georgia. Shortly thereafter, Bandit picks up professional dancer and apparent runaway bride Carrie (Sally Field), whom he nicknames Frog because she was always hopping around. However, by picking up Carrie, Bo becomes the target of Sheriff Buford T. Justice (Jackie Gleason), whose handsome yet very simple-minded son Junior (Mike Henry) was to have been Carrie's groom. The remainder of the film is essentially one big high-speed chase, as Bandit and Frog attract continuous attention from local and state police while Snowman barrels eastward with the Coors beer. Despite leaving his home jurisdiction, Sheriff Justice and his son continue to pursue Bandit, even as various mishaps cause their squad car to disintegrate around them. Bandit and Snowman are greatly assisted by a number of colorful characters met along the way, many of whom they contact through their CB radios; these acquaintances allow them to escape police pursuit on numerous occasions.QUESTIONS Neither Justice nor any of the other police officers are ever aware of Snowman's illegal cargo of Coors. Despite all the pursuit Sheriff Buford T Justice, how did the Bandit make it? What the bandit and snowman hauling in that truck? Why did the Bandit take a new deal instead of the money? Where did Frog come from and who was she? Why was Frog trying to escape from the sheriff in the first place?

Recently, I purchased the 3-Disc Criterion DVD set and am very pleased with it, but I'll get into that briefly in a little while. The film is 207 minutes (as you can see above) and that may seem like a daunting task for some and I myself was worried that it would be overlong, packed with fluff and at times, boring. Man, was I ever wrong.In foreign films it is often hard, at least in my opinion, to gauge how well an actor performs because we do not speak the language. So much of the performance is in the delivery of the lines that the effect is sometimes greatly lowered. Not here though, the performances are so great that it doesn't matter whether or not you understand what they are saying. Everyone is very good here, but the main praise has to go to our seven samurai. Everything they do, every emotion they give is 100% believable. You really grow to care about them through the movie, which is very important in any movie. The farmers are good as well. Some not as good as others but there isn't anyone that was bad or bogged the film down in any way.The music is really great. Sometimes it seems like it doesn't go well with the scenes (it can be a little funky at times but you will realize that is goes perfect with the scene. Later in the movie, the funkiness dissipates and the music is subtle at times and loud at others but it always is perfect. Fumio Hayasaka should be very proud of what he did (well, if he were still alive that is. Sadly, he died just one year after this movie was released).Now, normally black and white movies, as I've found, don't have very&#133;interesting cinematography to say the least. It's normally point and shoot. Now, I'm sure that isn't the case with all black and white movies, but the ones I've seen are just plain. This however, is amazing. There is always something going on. Be it a stream flowing, horses moving, people walking, flags waving or water wheels moving, there is always something moving and it makes the movie that much more interesting. Everything is filmed in such a beautiful way and the black and white image just enhances it. I personally feel that it would be impossible for this movie to be as great as it is if it were to be in color.Now, the DVD is from Criterion and it is my first DVD from them. From what I hear, they make the best DVD's. They make them for film buffs. Everything about them is as perfect as they can be. That said, this is an amazing first Criterion DVD. The image is absolutely stunning, even though it was made in 1954 and wasn't preserved all too well. There is little grain to be found, even in the dark night scenes (the black levels are superb). The sound is as good as your going to get but the picture will floor you. The set comes with a great booklet and some features I haven't yet had a chance to check out. This is a superb DVD set and I cannot recommend it enough, even at $35, which some people might balk at (shame on you!).What else is there to say about Seven Samurai that hasn't been said yet over the 53 years since its release. Three and a half hours may seem like a long time to be watching a movie, but the movie couldn't have gone on long enough. I was completely engrossed in this world and this is a movie experience I will never have again, at least not a first time. As I stated earlier, many people consider this to be the greatest film put to celluloid. I happen to be in that camp. It blends every genre to complete perfection. There are breathtaking action scenes (the rain fight at the end is utterly amazing, but don't think that this is an all out action movie, action doesn't really start until a while into the film but it doesn't matter, it keeps you captivated throughout), hilarious comedy bits that still hold up after all these years (hence the hilarious bit), suspense, drama and even a hint of romance (not a ton though).

Some people say that the Myers mask used in this film is bad, I actually like it. Dwight Little does a great job of refreshing the plot. A new sheriff, and a new damsel in distress (played wonderful by Danielle Harris), and of course everyone's favorite Donald Pleasence as the trench coat adversary Doctor Loomis. Micheal Myers is played by rookie George P. Wilbur who returned in Halloween 6. The gore in the film is a side note, but comes in at great times. The shotgun through the stomach is awesome.

It is not long before Johnnie finds himself a part of the McLaidlaw family even though the wider family perhaps feel that he is not a good enough match for Lina. Lina's patience is initially tested with Johnnie as some of his quirks bother and worry him but the loving streak behind his actions win her over. However as some worrying facts come to light about Johnnie, Lina starts to doubt that her husband has aspirations to bigger things that maybe extend to deceit, treachery and yes maybe even murder.In my view any Hitchcock movie is at very least worth a look and it was thus that I decided to return and watch this film again after almost two decades since I last saw it. Initially a bit dull the narrative quickly gets down into the business of throwing the audience back and forward in what we believe and what we don't. This makes for an interesting film albeit not as tense or gripping as I would have liked. The delivery is touched with an element of dark humour and mystery but the pace is perhaps a bit too slow at times. Hitchcock directs with the usual interesting touches and awareness of tone and atmosphere that you would expect from him, while the cinematography compliments the narrative by mixing the bright and carefree with the shadowy and threatening &#150; often in the same locations.As everyone and his dog will tell you, the ending is not that great and it does feel like a copout after so much back and forward &#150; a happy ending that plays to a simple audience while also satisfying the censors of the time. This aside the cast all work with the majority of the material well. Grant is slick but dark enough to work within his character. Fontaine convincingly flip-flops in her belief and works very well in keeping the audience with her no matter what she believes. Support is strong from Bruce, Carroll, Hardwicke and others despite them mostly doing small turns.Overall then a solid Hitchcock film; not anything that special but enough about it to be of interest. The cast and director work well with the narrative but the ending is a disappointment as it does nothing of any interest of value and panders to the lowest denominator.

The narrative follows a Photographic Lab Technician, Seymour (Sy) Parrish played by Robin Williams, who is a lonely, sad, creepy character living his life through other peoples photographs. He develops a dangerous obsession with a particular young family whose photographs he has processed over the years. Through his work he accidentally uncovers a less than ideal family situation, which he seeks to rectify.This film takes place in flashback. Voiceovers are used to drive the narrative and to heighten suspense by unnerving the audience. These are often Sy's voice-overs relating his personal knowledge on photography and applying his photographic insight to the narrative. For example in one scene Sy explains that a huntsman once noted that all the kills he had made on a particular day were hurried shots taken without deliberate aim, defining this way of hunting to the photographic term snapshot. This voice-over reinforces the unhealthy relationship Sy has with photography by making the connection between photography and hunting.The protagonist of the film One Hour Photo Sy Parrish is reminiscent of Norman Bates the protagonist of Alfred Hitchcock's 1960's film Psycho. Both protagonists appear innocently genuine, however they both have unhealthy obsessions. Norman Bates with his mother and Sy with the Yorkin family.The theme of One Hour Photo is voyeurism with Sy Parrish's invasion of people's privacy through viewing their photographs.Another form of visual art that is used to build up suspense in One Hour Photo is the television. An example of this is when Sy is watching an episode of The Simpsons where Homer tells Bart that the person who wants to harm him is probably the person he least expects. This gives the audience an insight into Sy's obsessive and potentially dangerous personality. Another example is when Sy is watching the film The Day the Earth Stood Still, the voice that can be heard is of an alien who explains to the people of the Earth that if they extend their violence to the outside world there will be consequences. This is an effective forecasting devise which gives the audience further insight into Sy Parrish's avenging character.The re-occurring motif throughout the film is photography. The shot composition is carefully chosen by Jeff Cronenweth to symbolise photographs. A good example of this is at the end of the film Sy is sitting in a room seen through a window, the image bordered by the window frame taking the appearance of a photograph. Another scene that visually reinforces the connection between photography and the theme of this film, is where Sy is looking down at a blank sheet of photographic paper, which in my opinion symbolises the emptiness of his life.In creating the creepy character of Sy Parish Robin Williams has once again truly cements his outstanding acting ability.One Hour Photo is a promising debut from Mark Romanek and I look forward to his future projects.7\/10 ","genre":"Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"24 February 2007","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Mark Romanek's debut film, One Hour Photo, is a gutsy and gripping psychological thriller.

Stransky has specifically requested reassignment from France to the Russian front in order that he may have an opportunity to win the Iron Cross before the war is finished. While the Russians get ever closer, Steiner finds his legendary status among the men no help in him saving them and he comes ever more into conflict with Stransky.Opening with a wonderfully smart title sequence this war film never pretends to the audience that this is going to be anything but an anti-war war film. Those in any doubt are put through several pointless and bloody battle sequences where losses are all around. In a way the film is a rather blunt weapon because this message is writ large across every battle scene and I found myself remote from the specific individuals involved and merely left with Peckinpah's overarching interest in the futility of the whole thing. To a certain degree it does of course work and the film is convincing in its depiction of the conditions and the battles are engaging and understandably chaotic. The problem I had with it is that it doesn't have a huge amount beyond this. Early on I assumed that the nature of the characters Steiner and Stransky meant that the film would create this miniature drama within the bigger picture. This element didn't totally work for me though and there was not much in the way of depth to the characters and the story.

Stransky has specifically requested reassignment from France to the Russian front in order that he may have an opportunity to win the Iron Cross before the war is finished. While the Russians get ever closer, Steiner finds his legendary status among the men no help in him saving them and he comes ever more into conflict with Stransky.Opening with a wonderfully smart title sequence this war film never pretends to the audience that this is going to be anything but an anti-war war film. Those in any doubt are put through several pointless and bloody battle sequences where losses are all around. In a way the film is a rather blunt weapon because this message is writ large across every battle scene and I found myself remote from the specific individuals involved and merely left with Peckinpah's overarching interest in the futility of the whole thing. To a certain degree it does of course work and the film is convincing in its depiction of the conditions and the battles are engaging and understandably chaotic. The problem I had with it is that it doesn't have a huge amount beyond this. Early on I assumed that the nature of the characters Steiner and Stransky meant that the film would create this miniature drama within the bigger picture.

It should be.(This is an extension of the review I wrote in February 2007)Every so often, a magnificent epic would just take you away from all that and just sweep you by your feet. James Cameron's unbeatable, $200 million TITANIC is exactly that film, so it just upsets me why some people still don't get it.I was just wondering, it compelled me more than any other film I've seen for quite awhile (not to mention, it won 11 awards in the Oscars and scored high in the box-office), but why some people try to act cynical and bash this wonderful motion picture (This film is rated 7\/10 here on IMDb? Come on!). Titanic is really that rare kind of masterpiece we don't usually find in today's film era. It wasn't just a big-budgeted film, it was a truly dramatic and touching tale with an old-fashioned romance that movies like CASABLANCA revolutionized. If movies like that are classics in a way TITANIC wanted to revisit, then may I ask what's wrong? The cast, headed by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, are superb. The direction and writing job by James Cameron is terrific (So is he just getting a hang of the love story thing? I think not!). But one of the real highlights is the superb score by James Horner, and the magnificent theme song. It has become one of my favorite all-time songs. The film too, has become one of my all-time favorites. Not only that, the film is also accurate on some of the facts. James Cameron really made sure to make it as realistic as possible. Like the sinking of the Titanic. Cameron really made that realistic (about the ship splitting in half before sinking). Anyway, combining such elements make it such a winner that won't insult you.I'm sure the movie is not without its imperfections, but when a movie's too good to be true, such elements don't come to you. It never did throughout the immense but utterly sweeping 194 minutes. It's entertainment at its best.Rating ***** out of 5.
