Everything is resolved, in a completely unexpected way, so unexpected that some people, obviously, failed to understand it.********  SPOILERS  ***** ***ONLY FOR THOSE WHO HAVE SEEN THE FILM****Ever heard of false memories? Even Lenny in the film points out that memories can't always be relied on. That's why there can be 2 different guys in the bathroom- because it's Lenny's memories, and they can change, if Lenny gets it into his head that it was a certain person- e.g. Teddy. The story of Sammy Jenkins, which was in black and white, is NOT TRUE. Didn't you get it? NOBODY MURDERED LENNY'S WIFE. A guy who broke into the house and raped her and struck Lenny to the ground, which caused his memory defect, was probably really already dead as Teddy said. Of course, you might choose to believe that Teddy was lying that time, too (as he does often, anyway), but I think it was true (and why would Teddy lie about it, since he had nothing to gain by this?) - since we see a picture of Lenny lying in bed with his wife, with I'VE DONE IT tattooed on his chest SHE WAS STILL ALIVE AFTER HE LOST HIS ABILITY TO REMEMBER, and he had killed the guy; but he was only shortly happy because of his revenge (which the picture Teddy took showed) and then he simply forgot. The story of Sammy is so important because IT IS ACTUALLY THE TRUE STORY OF LENNY AND HIS WIFE. She died of too many insulin shots as he described, but he didn't want to remember it. Haven't you ever heard that people repress some memories, that they stay in the subconsciousness, but pop up in an unexpected way? He preferred to believe there was still a bad guy somewhere who was responsible for everything- and looking for him in order to kill him would give his life a meaning. That's what the ending is about. So when Teddy told him the truth (as I believe), Lenny decided to make Teddy his bad guy. That's why he copied his license plate number and had it tattooed, and wrote Don't believe his lies. Why not? After all, he did lie to him and used him to kill Jimmy. Natalie lied and used him, too, to get rid of Dodd (who would otherwise threaten her or maybe kill her - obviously he was some guy involved in the drug dealing business with Jimmy). But it seems she was afterwards honestly trying to help him (and was interested in him in other ways, but what's the point when he can't even remember her). I think both Teddy and Natalie are neither good not bad, they seem to genuinely like him, but they also both used him to solve their problems. BTW, I first thought when Natalie gave Lenny the info, that she was maybe setting Teddy up (because she knew he had something to do with Jimmy's death), but no, she hadn't even made the connection, and she told Lenny the truth that time and did help him find his guy- the guy that Lenny decided to pursue. So the lie that Teddy was guilty for Lenny's wife's death is the lie that Lenny had made up.The only question that is left unanswered is What is Lenny going to do after he's killed Teddy?

They have taken a great story and adapted it to the screen very well, much better than some other movies that have been made from books. The overall flow of the story is very good, it does slow down a bit towards the middle, after the Council and before they enter Moria, but does pick back up.I do not agree with some of the changes in the story, but I don't think they really detract, rather give a new look at the story itself. My biggest gripe by far is the change of the Elf who meets them on the road, that being Arwen instead of Glorfindel, but still it helps to give Arwen a bigger role in the story and feed in the love that exists between Aragorn and Arwen and their future together.After just re-reading the first part of the trilogy before seeing the movie I was delighted to see quite a few direct quotes from the book's dialogue in the film. I always imagined Gandalf stooping at the windowsill and grabbing Sam by the scruff rather than hitting him on the head first, but it's still amusing none the less.Pippin and Merry's roles are a little played up in the screenplay, rather than the emotional support they portray in the book. They did bring a humorous side to the screenplay that was not untoward. We will have to see how they are played in the future installments.As has been stated in a few reviews, I am also disappointed in the introduction (rather abruptly, almost as if they were forgotten) of Gimli, Legolas and Borromir. It could have been explained easily with a few cut out scenes, Legolas in the hunt for Gollum after he escaped in Mirkwood. Borromir being sent by his father to ask about Narsil (the sword) and Gloin and Gimli being asked to come to Elrond to ask advice about Balin and his quest to retake Moria.Overall I think there is almost enough explanation in the story line to help with people who have not had the chance to read the book and other accompanying texts from Middle Earth. My Fiancé enjoyed the film and there was very little that she did not understand (if anything), well done to the screen writers.The Cast What can I say? Ian McKellen is Gandalf, it is how I imagined him to be. A portly Sean Astin plays Sam to a tee; Elijah with his child like features portrays a young Frodo well. His acting ability brings the childlike feeling that the Big Folk have towards Hobbits into play. Merry and Pippin (Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd) are played perfectly for they're new chosen roles.Sean Bean captures Borromir's character well, it's a shame the role never made it into the Two Towers as it was supposed to. Orlando Bloom looks such the part of a Sindan Elf; he plays the character very well. John Rhys-Davies (is that really him under all that hair?) plays a gruff dwarf well, but I think the character written for Gimli was a little older and angrier than he really was in the book.Viggo Mortenson plays a very good Strider \/ Aragorn, he really does live up to song \/ poem written by Bilbo. Ian Holm plays Bilbo well, he really makes you believe he is the bumbling hobbit that Bilbo always was, ready for a good laugh and adventure (with a push). The scene when he goes to grab the ring back from Frodo is done so well.Hugo Weaving, I think overplayed Elrond a bit, I never saw Elrond as that pretentious, maybe it was what was called for in the screenplay, actually all of the 'High' Elfs were pretentious, including Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, Marton Csokas as Celeborn and Craig Parker as Haldir. The scene where Frodo offers the ring to Galadriel is done well, I thought it a bit over the top at the time, but on re thinking about it (and talking to my Fiancé) it really does portray the evilness that the ring can bring out.Unexpectedly, Liv Tyler portrayed a very good Arwen (well the new improved screenplay Arwen). Christopher Lee gave the timeless yet somehow tainted look that is Saruman the 'Colorful' as he should have been known.The Effects Whilst I really could not fault the visual effects (once or twice you could really notice the Computer Generated Images, like when the Nazgul was searching above the four hiding Hobbits) the Sound was a bit loud in certain places, I think that they need to realize that a scream will pierce to the very bone even when its not loud.The Hobbits looked like Hobbits should, the Elfs and Dwarfs were also very well done, the size differences were perfect, and you'd swear that the actors who portrayed the Hobbits were only 4 tall!Overall I'd recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good story, who doesn't mind sitting in a chair for 3 hours, and especially to those that love the fantasy genre or Tolkien's works. I gave the Movie a 9 \/ 10 as I think that there were some small faults that did detract from an overall 10 in my views.Whilst the story is different from that of the book, it has been changed in a way that does not harm the content. It still stays fairly true to the story (epic if you will) written by Tolkien. I'd like to know who the dialogue coach for speaking Quenta (elfish) was though.Happy viewing.

They have taken a great story and adapted it to the screen very well, much better than some other movies that have been made from books. The overall flow of the story is very good, it does slow down a bit towards the middle, after the Council and before they enter Moria, but does pick back up.I do not agree with some of the changes in the story, but I don't think they really detract, rather give a new look at the story itself. My biggest gripe by far is the change of the Elf who meets them on the road, that being Arwen instead of Glorfindel, but still it helps to give Arwen a bigger role in the story and feed in the love that exists between Aragorn and Arwen and their future together.After just re-reading the first part of the trilogy before seeing the movie I was delighted to see quite a few direct quotes from the book's dialogue in the film. I always imagined Gandalf stooping at the windowsill and grabbing Sam by the scruff rather than hitting him on the head first, but it's still amusing none the less.Pippin and Merry's roles are a little played up in the screenplay, rather than the emotional support they portray in the book. They did bring a humorous side to the screenplay that was not untoward. We will have to see how they are played in the future installments.As has been stated in a few reviews, I am also disappointed in the introduction (rather abruptly, almost as if they were forgotten) of Gimli, Legolas and Borromir. It could have been explained easily with a few cut out scenes, Legolas in the hunt for Gollum after he escaped in Mirkwood. Borromir being sent by his father to ask about Narsil (the sword) and Gloin and Gimli being asked to come to Elrond to ask advice about Balin and his quest to retake Moria.Overall I think there is almost enough explanation in the story line to help with people who have not had the chance to read the book and other accompanying texts from Middle Earth. My Fiancé enjoyed the film and there was very little that she did not understand (if anything), well done to the screen writers.The Cast What can I say? Ian McKellen is Gandalf, it is how I imagined him to be. A portly Sean Astin plays Sam to a tee; Elijah with his child like features portrays a young Frodo well. His acting ability brings the childlike feeling that the Big Folk have towards Hobbits into play. Merry and Pippin (Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd) are played perfectly for they're new chosen roles.Sean Bean captures Borromir's character well, it's a shame the role never made it into the Two Towers as it was supposed to. Orlando Bloom looks such the part of a Sindan Elf; he plays the character very well. John Rhys-Davies (is that really him under all that hair?) plays a gruff dwarf well, but I think the character written for Gimli was a little older and angrier than he really was in the book.Viggo Mortenson plays a very good Strider \/ Aragorn, he really does live up to song \/ poem written by Bilbo.

Has the weighty subject matter of films like A Beautiful Mind and Ali got you down?  Has the emphasis on making the world a better place gotten on your damn nerves already?  I can think of no better remedy than How High.  No real story, no real moral, and no one comes out of this a better person, but dear sweet Lord is it funny.Redman and Method Man star as losers from the projects who, through contrivances so funny I cannot reveal them here, have grown a magical Marijuana plant.  This plant makes them smarter and they get into Harvard, where hilarity ensues.  That's pretty much it.  How High is juvenile and structureless with characters who have no arc, but that doesn't matter.  This film's duty to the audience, first and foremost, is to make them laugh.  And indeed it does.  This is the first movie I've seen in a long while in this Farrelly Brothers wasteland that knows how to do gross-out comedy successfully.  Movies like Freddy Got Fingered and Not Another Teen Movie remember the gross-out, but not the comedy.There will be some who say that this is vulgar and tasteless and has no redeeming social value.  You will get no argument from me, but therein lies its charm.  How High takes nothing sacred and doesn't play it safe, as opposed to the Adam Sandler movies where he feels the need to redeem himself.And there will be a few more who say, in this post Bamboozled era, that this film caters to the absolute worst in a predominantly African-American audience.  There I will disagree, for How High is a movie about pot, which gets the same response out of everyone.  The race of the main characters, I believe, is incidental.  This could be about two white guys and the results would look roughly the same.I could talk about the political response to this film for ages, but this film doesn't really warrant such a discussion.  It's a comedy, which by definition is designed to make you laugh, and it's successful if it meets that end.  Besides, how foolish would you look if you got into a discussion of the social ramifications of a movie like this?

Having read the book dozens of times since the '70s greatly enhanced my enjoyment of the film.  I can see how the uninitiated might not get it--one hapless viewer commented that he didn't think Galadriel's character was necessary.  Tolkien fans will get the most out of this film because they can read between the scenes so to speak. However, Jackson did a fine job making the film comprehensible to those who haven't read the book, which is no small feat.  Others have complained that the special effects were imperfect and not as good as those of The Matrix (yawn!).  I was pleased that the effects were just good enough to be convincing--I went for the story, not to marvel at gratuitous digital technology.  Others have complained that Jackson made some changes to the story.  First of all, Tolkien thought of himself as a translator of a historical record which was LOTR.  The published version of his account can be thought of as The Bible, written by divers hands long ago.  For all we know it could be a flawed account or inaccurate.  I consider Peter Jackson's version as a different but very similar account--imagine two different books on WWI--you would expect a few minor discrepancies.  None of us know for a fact that Arwen didn't rescue Frodo from the ringwraiths.  That's not how it happened in Tolkien's book, but it's more fun for me to think that either version is possible.  That's how legends and myths are made, tales handed down through the ages, sometimes embellished, sometimes diminished, but in all of them are the grains of truth.What I liked least about the movie  I have very few complaints.  The worst moment is when Aragorn and Frodo are poised on a teetering rock in Moria and Aragorn says, Lean forward!, eliciting a groan from the audience.  They could have just leaped and gotten it over with.  There were also a couple of weed jokes which don't exist in the book.  The soundtrack got the mood right, in a generic way, but it could have been more medieval in flavor. Enya and Liz Frazer were clever choices, but why not go one step further and get Dead Can Dance to contribute?What I liked best Galadriel's transformation as she is tempted by the ring, the interior of Moria, how the elves were portrayed, and the generous length (three hours!), because I never wanted it to end.

Ever since the first time I read the novels, I knew that it was only a matter of time until this epic was on the screen. I had no idea that I would have to wait so long.The wait was absolutely worth it. Peter Jackson doesn't skimp at all. The elves look right, the languages feel and sound correct to me, not at all interfering with the mind's eye or mind's ear that has already shown you the land, the people, and allowed you in some sense to hear the ancient tongues spoken. This is truly a film worthy of the legacy that J.R.R. Tolkien left us. I do not believe that he would be upset in any important fashion. The acting was, well, spot on. The landscapes were breathtaking, and the whole vision that Jackson is bringing to life is so filled that I now know that nobody else would have done such a wonderful job.If you love the books, if you love the characters, then this is a must see for you. If you love fantasy, but simply found The Lord of the Rings to be too much to consume, then this is the easiest way for you to digest its majesty. And when you get to the novels you'll see that there is more that awaits you. Nobody is disappointed in this excruciatingly faithful adaptation. Even the details, and plot points, that were left out are gone for reason they detracted from the root of the plot. If it wasn't in the line of the main story, Jackson cut it out. Cutting out anything from Tolkien is tricky work, but the pruning was left at just the right amount. Amazing.I sincerely felt that this movie was not the length that it was. But the clocks didn't deceive. It simply moves so well that I still can't imagine how it was done. Usually, unless it is a movie of incredible stature, like Gandhi or Shindler's List, the length would become a detraction. But here it is not.  This is proof alone that The Fellowship is a movie of great stature.There is little that I can add to the great reviews already here, except to give my vote and to tell you this go see this movie.But how do I rate it? Will this movie withstand multiple viewings? I believe so. Is it of such quality that it will last as a testament to Peter Jackson and engage Tolkien fans for years to come? I think so. Will all following fantasy movies be measured against this, as the novels are used as the yardstick that fantasy writing is measured with? Probably.  Is it cinematic perfection? No, it is not.And that is why I cannot, and will not, give this movie a 10 rating.

This is truly a film worthy of the legacy that J.R.R. Tolkien left us. I do not believe that he would be upset in any important fashion. The acting was, well, spot on. The landscapes were breathtaking, and the whole vision that Jackson is bringing to life is so filled that I now know that nobody else would have done such a wonderful job.If you love the books, if you love the characters, then this is a must see for you. If you love fantasy, but simply found The Lord of the Rings to be too much to consume, then this is the easiest way for you to digest its majesty.

Not so with The Fellowship of the Ring.Peter Jackson, the director (and part screenwriter) decided to give some background to the Ring right away to set the stage for those poor unfortunates in the audience who have not read the novel. It is simply splendid. A film can fill in details not given in a novel since action can be so hard--and take so long--to describe. I could quibble with the manner in which Isildur, Aragorn's ancestor, cut the ring from Sauron's hand; but, I must admit, that the sequence is thrilling and Sauron himself is wonderfully fearsome.The sets are marvelous. The actors are spot on. Ian Holm, cast as Bilbo, was an inspired choice. Ian McKellen as Gandalf is equally as good. And Christopher Lee as Saruman is glorious. What a voice!As far as the language used in the film I can report that I am well satisfied with the pronunciation of the little bits that were used. I got a small thrill from hearing the voice of Sauron repeating, Ash nazg durbatuluk, ash nazg gimbatul, etc., at a few points. The voice was almost subliminal but I chimed right in out loud. I've known that verse since I was 16.As I'm writing this I'm thinking of all the liberties taken by the film makers with the story...but I forgive them because they had an immense task to make a Reader's Digest version of 'The Fellowship of the Ring' and make it visually compelling. They have done so in spades.There are things about the film that remind me how well stories in a book can be rendered visually. The orcs crawling down the pillars in Moria; the Balrog (oh, my god!); the roof of Orthanc; the way Frodo sees the world when he wears the Ring; the flood of the river Bruinen; the Watcher in the water; Rivendell; Bilbo's hobbit hole; the opportunity Isildur had to destroy the Ring at the end of the Second Age; Gollum (!); the ruins of the tower of Amon Sul and the attack of the Nazgul; the pillars of the Argonath; Minas Tirith...to see these things after having read the novel a couple dozen times is really quite marvelous. It in no way spoils what I see in my mind's eye because the vision of Peter Jackson is quite as good if not better. Using the talents of Alan Lee and John Howe, two of the best-known Tolkien illustrators, was very smart.Yes, there were times while watching the film that my mental images clashed with Jackson's approach. And, inevitably, there are things that get short shrift and things that are not explained well enough. I figure that most people will wonder how Bilbo got so old so quickly after leaving the Shire. In the novel it's clear that Frodo doesn't set out with the Ring for another 17 years after Bilbo departs; in the movie it seems like it can't be more than six months. I also imagine that people unfamiliar with the novel will wonder why Frodo and company stopped in Lothlorien at all and what was the purpose of looking in Galadriel's mirror.Other things missing include the building of the friendship between Gimli and Legolas; Frodo's song at The Prancing Pony; Tom Bombadil; the Barrow wights; Farmer Maggot; the conspiracy of Sam, Merry, Pippin, and Fatty Bolger; the importance of Bill the pony to Sam; Glorfindel, the Elf; the lake of Kheled Zaram; dealing with the wound that Frodo got in the Chamber of Mazarbul; and the gifts that Galadriel gave to the other members of the Fellowship besides Frodo.But, golly whollickers! There are plenty of things that make up for those missing events. The birth of a new type of orc in Orthanc; the surprisingly good performance of Viggo Mortenson as Aragorn (I'd only seen him in 'G. I. Jane'); superb characterizations by Sean Bean as Boromir and Orlando Bloom as Legolas--whoa! that guy can shoot a bow!; the wonderfully horrible settings of the Dark Tower, Mount Doom, and the ring of Isengard; the absolutely, flat-out, incredibly fabulous Moria...and especially the Balrog.If you have any appreciation for the action\/adventure genre you won't be disappointed. If you've read the trilogy then I believe that you will find that the movie sets a new high water mark for the rendering of novels into film. This movie is enough to make me want to buy a DVD player in preparation for the release of the DVD. And the music is good, too!It wasn't the best movie I've ever seen (I still put 'Alien' and 'Silence of the Lambs' and a few others ahead) but it was wonderfully entertaining. Its greatest value for me, I think, is that, once again, I was treated to the spectacle of someone else's imagination made tangible and memorable. It stimulates my own way beyond what I thought possible and increases my undying appreciation for Tolkien's masterpiece.See it!

I also imagine that people unfamiliar with the novel will wonder why Frodo and company stopped in Lothlorien at all and what was the purpose of looking in Galadriel's mirror.Other things missing include the building of the friendship between Gimli and Legolas; Frodo's song at The Prancing Pony; Tom Bombadil; the Barrow wights; Farmer Maggot; the conspiracy of Sam, Merry, Pippin, and Fatty Bolger; the importance of Bill the pony to Sam; Glorfindel, the Elf; the lake of Kheled Zaram; dealing with the wound that Frodo got in the Chamber of Mazarbul; and the gifts that Galadriel gave to the other members of the Fellowship besides Frodo.But, golly whollickers! There are plenty of things that make up for those missing events. The birth of a new type of orc in Orthanc; the surprisingly good performance of Viggo Mortenson as Aragorn (I'd only seen him in 'G. I. Jane'); superb characterizations by Sean Bean as Boromir and Orlando Bloom as Legolas--whoa! that guy can shoot a bow!; the wonderfully horrible settings of the Dark Tower, Mount Doom, and the ring of Isengard; the absolutely, flat-out, incredibly fabulous Moria...and especially the Balrog.If you have any appreciation for the action\/adventure genre you won't be disappointed. If you've read the trilogy then I believe that you will find that the movie sets a new high water mark for the rendering of novels into film. This movie is enough to make me want to buy a DVD player in preparation for the release of the DVD. And the music is good, too!It wasn't the best movie I've ever seen (I still put 'Alien' and 'Silence of the Lambs' and a few others ahead) but it was wonderfully entertaining. Its greatest value for me, I think, is that, once again, I was treated to the spectacle of someone else's imagination made tangible and memorable. It stimulates my own way beyond what I thought possible and increases my undying appreciation for Tolkien's masterpiece.See it!

Okay, for starters, how about that the original film Open Your Eyes by Alejandro Amenabar was an extremely pretentious, poorly shot, and deliberately confusing (even to the director himself) art film.  Now, I have nothing against art films, if there made with style and that style is backed up with substance.  But Open Your Eyes  tries to be all of that, and fails by trying to be clever.  Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that Penelope Cruz is in both films. But this review is not about Open Your Eyes. Cameron Crowe had just won on oscar for what I felt was the best film of 2000, Almost Famous.  His other films, Say Anything Fast Times at Ridgemont High (which he scripted, but didn't direct), Jerry Maguire, and Singles  are all very intelligent, witty films about dating and growing up.  So, now Crowe decides to move out of the genre which he knows so well and make an art film.  Fine, Paul Thomas Anderson did it with Magnolia and did a bang up job.  So with that, I'll tell you that I was looking forward immensely to Vanilla Sky (I watched Open Your Eyes after Vanilla Sky).My high expectations were dashed to pieces with this incomprehensible plot and blatant symbolism which doesn't really make sense.The story (if you can call it that) involves Tom Cruise as a vain daddy's boy, whose parents die, he inherents their thriving company and he basically makes a living making an ass out of himself.  He's sleeping with Cameron Diaz, ditches her for Penelope Cruz (who after this and Captain Corelli's Mandolin, should be deported), and then wonders why Diaz drives them both off the road in a spectacularly silly slow-motion car wreck.  The rest of the film has Cruise (now disfigured) trying to win back Cruz ... Then everything is summed up nicely at the end in an elaborate denouement which Crowe (or Amenabar) pulls out of his ass.I'm not really sure who's to blame for this crap, Crowe, Amenabar, or Cruise for convincing Crowe to remake the film.It's themes could have made a good movie.  It has shades of better films (Waking Life, Dark City, Cruise's own Eyes Wide Shut) but instead it takes all of its ideas and intentions and makes... no sense at all.Cameron Crowe, please make another coming of age movie!
