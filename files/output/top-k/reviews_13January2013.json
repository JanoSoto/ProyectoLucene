I really appreciated it more and really enjoyed it. I looked at comments of this up on here and they didn't look convincing. One of my friends bought me the Blu ray of this for Christmas and I thought 'see what I think, this could be good' Just watched it last night, oh dear, is all I can say.To be honest, it was nice to see Jennifer Love Hewitt again. But I thought she died in the first film? Oh no wait, it was a dream. So I thought 'OK fair enough' The character connections were OK but I felt more for Jennifer Love Hewitt. The acting was OK I suppose but nothing Oscar worthy.The story was very weak and very predictable. The main character's friend wins a competition to the Bahamas so she invites Jennifer Hewitt along with two other friends. So now you immediately know, the killer is at large and is going to follow them there. Now this familiar. Where did I see this before? Oh yeah, Jaws The Revenge. You clearly know the writers have watched that before hand and thought it would work for this. Well trust me, it doesn't. When they enter the island, it happens to be stormy season and they are the only ones left on the entire island. Are you joking? was this idea stolen from The Shining? (which is my all time favorite film in the world).The filming was fine and the cinematography was fine, I'll be honest.Now the twist is the main downfall of this film. You find that the killer has an accomplice. Who is it? its one of the main character's friend's, who just happens to be his son. Wow that also sounds like Scream. The killer then takes off his hat ans speaks for the first time. To be honest, he should of stayed muted because his acting was laughable. This was the time I put my hand on face in disbelief. The end, its all happily ever after, or is it? Yes folks an opening for another sequel.Please do not bother with this movie, its atrocious. But if your looking for a good time with friends and feel like taking the mick out of a film, watch this. I Know What You Did Last Summer fans, if you watched the first one and not this one, please stick to the first one. Don't bother wasting your money, time and effort.

However, don't let the cast fool you. This film certainly isn't either Bill Hartman or Arnold Schwarzenegger's finest hour, but nevertheless, some moments in it are genuinely funny. I found myself watching some scenes, and in my opinion, certain jokes that weren't funny could have been if they were written a bit differently.The really big let down for this film was the ending, as I feel it sort of began to trail off and took us out of the moment we were in. The way it ends does make you feel like the kid had been a bit ungrateful, as he gives the toy (his father at last having found one) that Howard went through quite a lot to get Jamie to the other father. The other father (played by Sinbad) does also go through quite a lot to not only get the Turbo Man toy, but also to snatch it from Jamie (the son), to the point of also endangering both of their lives.The film also includes a little extra after the credits, in which Howard's wife wonders what he has gotten her for Christmas, leaving us with an open ending, and a potential for a sequel (although one doesn't seem to have been made).Overall, I think this was an OK film, but I doubt it will be viewed as a favourite film of all time by anyone, or even best Christmas film ever, particularly if you have seen films such as Elf or It's A Wonderful Life.

Forman's farce was intended as a good-natured ribbing of the Communist system, specifically its corruption and bureaucratic ineptness. The censors and Ponti didn't like it because in their eyes, it had no sympathy for its working class subjects, who come across as complete fools.As the story goes, Communist officials decided to play the film in the small town where the film was shot, which featured locals playing themselves as members of the local fireman's committee. As things turned out, the officials were shocked when the townspeople vigorously applauded the film. They identified immediately with the broken down system, where a fire breaks out across the street, but the firefighters are unable to do anything, as their fire truck ends up stuck in the snow. As for their farcical characters, they regarded it as simply 'acting' and obviously were flattered to be chosen to be part of a professional film production. Forman was ultimately saved by French director Francois Traffaut, who ended up buying the film with some partners and distributing it outside of Czechoslovakia, where it was permanently banned after the Soviet invasion.As for the film itself, 'The Fireman's Ball', manages to be distinctive, mainly on the basis of the authenticity of its performers. You have to love the amateur cast Forman has assembled here, as they seem to have a natural flair for farce. Nonetheless, the basic theme of the film, the corruption inherent in the Communist system of that time, as evidenced by the constant thefts that occur during the event, go on ad infinitum. That's not to say there aren't occasional laughs. When the Chairman has the lights turned off, expecting the thief to return the lottery presents, when the lights do come back on, the opposite occurs the rest of the gifts are all missing. The deepest laugh remains subtle one of the firemen attempts to return a headcheese (cold cut) to the dining table, after he discovers his wife has pilfered it. Completely embarrassed, he passes out when everyone observes what he's trying to do and an argument ensues right afterward between two of his colleagues, one shouting down the other that by being 'honest', he's embarrassed the fire brigade. It seems that being honest, is much less desirable then looking out for one's own self-interest.The Fireman's Ball plot involves the fire committee's inept manner in which they attempt to choose a local beauty queen. The young women who are conscripted appear not to take the fire officials seriously, and end up running off to the ladies room, where they've made it clear that they have no intention of participating in the committee's ultimate goal (the idea is for the winner of the pageant to present a memento to their retiring chief). While it's one thing for the firemen to be overwhelmed in dealing with the 'larceny problem' at the ball, it's another to come off as completely ridiculous, which is what they appear to be, when they foolishly attempt to put the pageant together and then atrociously fail, with all the young women giggling, and running away from them. Perhaps this is why Mr. Ponti, the film's original producer, did not care for the film.Forman does well in breaking up the action at the ball, when he introduces the fire at the old man's house, near the dance hall. The event turns out to be bittersweet, as there's also some humor attached to the somber events. We see this when the crowd moves the old man closer to the fire, as he complains about being cold. And later when they want to give him some lottery tickets, he asks for money instead, as it's obvious all the prizes now have been stolen.'The Fireman's Ball' ends on two additional humorous notes. First, the chief finally receives his honorarium from his colleagues--but of course it turns out to be stolen.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"13 January 2013","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" No matter how prepared we get for corniness, we rapidly find ourselves absorbed by the romance between Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze and much more by the depiction of death&#x85; strangely plausible and, no pun intended, quite haunting.Indeed, the main premise of Ghost, which won the Best Original Screenplay Oscar, is to feature death from the dead's perspective. Not a revolutionary plot device but the only one that occupies the whole story with the ghost trying to reach the living. Why wouldn't Sam try to talk to his parents, his friends, why would Molly, all of sudden, become the center of his afterlife? The script tactfully escapes from this criticism when it's clearly established that Sam's death is not accidental, and the cause of his murder incidentally puts Molly in a dangerous situation. I also want to answer one criticism expressed by Roger Ebert, why would a ghost still care about Earthly matters, why wouldn't follow the white light and go have a chat with either Elvis of Aristotles? I think that the most important feeling channeled by Swayze's performance is disbelief. He can't get the idea of not belonging to this world anymore, and this is why I felt that the portrayal of death, as a separation between the soul and the body, and the atrocious witnessing of one's death, was 'plausible', I could imagine myself dying this way. It's even ironic how Sam goes through the stages of grief for his own death, from denial to resignation. And it's extraordinary how Swayze perfectly captures the desperateness of a man who had so much to do, so many dreams and projects and finally saw his life abruptly cut. His penetrating expressions are astonishingly convincing, whether it's for sadness, empathy, compassion, his eyes are more eloquent than any of his lines. And his performance is crucial since he's portraying an isolated character. As soon as he becomes a ghost, he only interacts with a few other ghosts, even Whoopi Goldberg who plays the medium Oda Mae, can only hear him. Swayze's believability relies on his ability to touch the viewers instead of the characters, definitely the most defining performance of an actor who sadly left us too soon.And Sam's exhaustive journey, starts with his necessity to deal with his new condition, in order to stop the scheme that lead to his death. And the learning part renovates all the good old archetypes of the ghost crossing doors and touching objects. Ghosts can feel sensations and only touch or move things if they're able to think themselves as ghosts, it's an exciting part of the film to see a man learning his powers to be able to use them as weapons. In conclusion, Sam stays because he can't believe he dies and he tries to reach Molly because she's in danger. We're far from the whole 'unfinished job' and 'transcending love' clichés, the film delivers something original out of familiar material. The film also innovates with the scary portrayal of the bad guys' deaths. The atrocious sight of moaning evil shadows converging to take someone away justifies the belief in a sort of immanent justice, and the exhilarating idea that we all die twice, the good people going to heaven, and the others in some place, we don't want to know. The villains' demises is very unsettling, it can even traumatize some sensitive minds, and you see in Swayze's eyes that he feels sorry for them, for even death don't make people even. But Ghost's thrilling metaphysical value also originates the magnificent ending which is probably the closest depiction to heaven ever gracing the screen.And there's another cliché that the film tactfully reinvents, the 'Old Magic Negro', and it succeeds for two reasons. First, Oda Mae is a crook, she's not a real medium, which is funny and she discovers that she really has the power, which is even funnier. Secondly, it's Whoopi Goldberg and it's one of her greatest roles, earning her the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, and beyond the comic relief aspect, this is exactly what a supporting performance is supposed to be secondary, yet so scene-stealing that we can't imagine the film without it. Goldberg provides all the laughs, capable of the most acid irony with Swayze, and being comprehensive and diplomatic, in her streetwise way, with Molly. This is a credit to Jerry Zucker, who didn't forget his comedic roots and made a few hilarious moments of the film.

Not a revolutionary plot device but the only one that occupies the whole story with the ghost trying to reach the living. Why wouldn't Sam try to talk to his parents, his friends, why would Molly, all of sudden, become the center of his afterlife? The script tactfully escapes from this criticism when it's clearly established that Sam's death is not accidental, and the cause of his murder incidentally puts Molly in a dangerous situation. I also want to answer one criticism expressed by Roger Ebert, why would a ghost still care about Earthly matters, why wouldn't follow the white light and go have a chat with either Elvis of Aristotles? I think that the most important feeling channeled by Swayze's performance is disbelief. He can't get the idea of not belonging to this world anymore, and this is why I felt that the portrayal of death, as a separation between the soul and the body, and the atrocious witnessing of one's death, was 'plausible', I could imagine myself dying this way. It's even ironic how Sam goes through the stages of grief for his own death, from denial to resignation. And it's extraordinary how Swayze perfectly captures the desperateness of a man who had so much to do, so many dreams and projects and finally saw his life abruptly cut. His penetrating expressions are astonishingly convincing, whether it's for sadness, empathy, compassion, his eyes are more eloquent than any of his lines. And his performance is crucial since he's portraying an isolated character. As soon as he becomes a ghost, he only interacts with a few other ghosts, even Whoopi Goldberg who plays the medium Oda Mae, can only hear him. Swayze's believability relies on his ability to touch the viewers instead of the characters, definitely the most defining performance of an actor who sadly left us too soon.And Sam's exhaustive journey, starts with his necessity to deal with his new condition, in order to stop the scheme that lead to his death. And the learning part renovates all the good old archetypes of the ghost crossing doors and touching objects. Ghosts can feel sensations and only touch or move things if they're able to think themselves as ghosts, it's an exciting part of the film to see a man learning his powers to be able to use them as weapons. In conclusion, Sam stays because he can't believe he dies and he tries to reach Molly because she's in danger. We're far from the whole 'unfinished job' and 'transcending love' clichés, the film delivers something original out of familiar material. The film also innovates with the scary portrayal of the bad guys' deaths. The atrocious sight of moaning evil shadows converging to take someone away justifies the belief in a sort of immanent justice, and the exhilarating idea that we all die twice, the good people going to heaven, and the others in some place, we don't want to know. The villains' demises is very unsettling, it can even traumatize some sensitive minds, and you see in Swayze's eyes that he feels sorry for them, for even death don't make people even. But Ghost's thrilling metaphysical value also originates the magnificent ending which is probably the closest depiction to heaven ever gracing the screen.And there's another cliché that the film tactfully reinvents, the 'Old Magic Negro', and it succeeds for two reasons. First, Oda Mae is a crook, she's not a real medium, which is funny and she discovers that she really has the power, which is even funnier. Secondly, it's Whoopi Goldberg and it's one of her greatest roles, earning her the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, and beyond the comic relief aspect, this is exactly what a supporting performance is supposed to be secondary, yet so scene-stealing that we can't imagine the film without it. Goldberg provides all the laughs, capable of the most acid irony with Swayze, and being comprehensive and diplomatic, in her streetwise way, with Molly. This is a credit to Jerry Zucker, who didn't forget his comedic roots and made a few hilarious moments of the film.

Goodfellas is quite a scary movie in terms of it's character's attributes, the main one being Pesci's, his Tommy, played with such a haunting ferocity. This is the most scary performance I've seen in a mafia film. He makes the character he played in Casino, Nicky Santori, look tame, although the the two bare some resemblances, especially in the violence and recklessness department. The story is told through the eyes of mafia figure, Henry Hill, played superbly by Ray Liotta, his most notable performance, when the mentioning of this actor's name comes up. Hill who died a while back, had described the mafia as a dark and terrifying world as seen through this brilliant film. It's through his eyes we meet these characters, like Jimmy the Gent, Conway, De Niro excelling himself again, and also Paul Sorvino as Paulie Cicero, a Sicilian godfather less threatening cause of his laid back manner, but looks can be deceiving. We move through Henry's wannabe mafia type, from childhood, that had him skipping school, subjecting him to a whacking from his father here and there, right through to his two incarcerations, where after getting out of the second one, thanks to his mother in law who puts up bail, he is soon making a deal of immunity. Reasons. One, his wife (Bracco) who goes to see Deniro is pointed towards this alley where all these coats are hanging. Should she go in there? No, why? Cause she'll probably get whacked. She options to quickly take off instead. To me, this was the most terrifying moment in this near two and a half hour film. Two, the other reason, Deniro asks Liotta to whack a guy down in Miami, and knows that if he accepts this, he won't came back alive. Death is shown so cheaply here, where if you don't do the right thing, the probability of living is null. One of the hoods, Stax, played by Samuel L Jackson in one of it's memorable bloody scenes, is one such an example, where a montage of other victims follow. Goodfellas has some real bloody moments, one involving a connected guy who's celebrating, getting out, on Henry's Hill's actual birthday, where his mouth earns him a helluva of a bashing, followed by a freshly dug grave. When it comes to violence, this movie is uncompromising, but these thugs existed.

Inspired by real events, the movie starts out with a new football coach of the TC Williams High School Titans, Herman Boone (Denzel Washington) must put a newly desegregated school football team together. He faced pressure from a staff, and town not yet ready to be racial diversity. Denzel Washington portrays Boone as a hard-ass man. Most of the scenes, we hardly see him lightly up. He puts his team of real life athletes made out of yet famous oncoming actors through the grinder through football camp. Look out for Donald Faison, Ethan Suplee, and Ryan Gosling all new, whom gone off to bigger and better roles. This team is lead by team captains Gerry Bertier (Ryan Hurst of 'Son of Anarachy' fame) and Julius Campbell (Wood Harris) or as they are mostly known as Main White Guy and Main Black Guy. After returning from football camp, Boone is told by a member of the school board that if he loses even a single game, he will be fired. Not only that, but there is hatred for him, replacing long favorite coach Bill Yoast (Will Patton). Note to audience, look out for a really young Hayden Panettiere playing his tomboy football fan daughter. Bill decides he wants move on to other coaching opportunities. In a show of respect and in an attempt to ease racial tension, Boone offers an assistant coaching position to Yoast. Yoast at first refuses Boone's offer, but is then tempted to join after the white players pledge to boycott the team if he doesn't participate. Dismayed at the prospect of the students losing their chances at scholarships, Yoast changes his mind. Subsequently, the Titans must go through the season undefeated while battling racial prejudice. The movie has a good message, but it's so predictable, and formulaic. It's always there to remind you that racism is bad. Sometimes the movie can be a little bit too preachy. The long-suffering, heroic black players are all portrayed as decent if understandably angry given the atmosphere of overt hostility, but with few flaws that might flesh out or sully their characters' purity as symbols in the civil rights struggle. The white players, on the other hand, range from the villainous to the buffoonish to the saintly. You see this time after time in Hollywood movies before and after. It's become too much of the same. The film also suffers from historically inaccurates, and fabrications sub-stories, while it's doesn't hurt the film at all, it shines some real-life characters in a bad light or misleading such as Bertier's girlfriend being racist and Ronald 'Sunshine' Bass being bi or gay. The people of Alexandria were rarely racist at all, but also sophisticated and multicultural at the time, as the streets were suburbs rather than a small, isolated town picture in the film. I'm not saying there wasn't racial tension, but not in what they made picture in the film. One of the worst thing about the film is the third act and ending--- the film goes off into 'Win one for the gipper' mode to demonstrate the essence of the film; that despite differences the team was united and the legacy of the monumental all-out-victory football season carried on. Rather than ending the film at the final game, the film leaves the audience in a sour-note by explaining what happen to one of their team members 10 years later. The epilogue reveals what many of the Titans are doing today was kinda cheesy. The film does a great job on the use of music, both in film score composer in Trevor Rabin 'Titan Spirit' which is epic and the use of popular music of the day such as Ain't No Mountain High Enough of Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell & 'Na Na Hey Hey Goodbye Steam.

After returning from football camp, Boone is told by a member of the school board that if he loses even a single game, he will be fired. Not only that, but there is hatred for him, replacing long favorite coach Bill Yoast (Will Patton). Note to audience, look out for a really young Hayden Panettiere playing his tomboy football fan daughter. Bill decides he wants move on to other coaching opportunities. In a show of respect and in an attempt to ease racial tension, Boone offers an assistant coaching position to Yoast. Yoast at first refuses Boone's offer, but is then tempted to join after the white players pledge to boycott the team if he doesn't participate. Dismayed at the prospect of the students losing their chances at scholarships, Yoast changes his mind. Subsequently, the Titans must go through the season undefeated while battling racial prejudice. The movie has a good message, but it's so predictable, and formulaic. It's always there to remind you that racism is bad. Sometimes the movie can be a little bit too preachy. The long-suffering, heroic black players are all portrayed as decent if understandably angry given the atmosphere of overt hostility, but with few flaws that might flesh out or sully their characters' purity as symbols in the civil rights struggle. The white players, on the other hand, range from the villainous to the buffoonish to the saintly. You see this time after time in Hollywood movies before and after. It's become too much of the same. The film also suffers from historically inaccurates, and fabrications sub-stories, while it's doesn't hurt the film at all, it shines some real-life characters in a bad light or misleading such as Bertier's girlfriend being racist and Ronald 'Sunshine' Bass being bi or gay. The people of Alexandria were rarely racist at all, but also sophisticated and multicultural at the time, as the streets were suburbs rather than a small, isolated town picture in the film. I'm not saying there wasn't racial tension, but not in what they made picture in the film. One of the worst thing about the film is the third act and ending--- the film goes off into 'Win one for the gipper' mode to demonstrate the essence of the film; that despite differences the team was united and the legacy of the monumental all-out-victory football season carried on. Rather than ending the film at the final game, the film leaves the audience in a sour-note by explaining what happen to one of their team members 10 years later. The epilogue reveals what many of the Titans are doing today was kinda cheesy. The film does a great job on the use of music, both in film score composer in Trevor Rabin 'Titan Spirit' which is epic and the use of popular music of the day such as Ain't No Mountain High Enough of Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell & 'Na Na Hey Hey Goodbye Steam. All three songs has been associated for years after this movie with the Titans. Most known those tunes by this movie. The movie is a family friendly movie. So check it out, and remember the titans.
