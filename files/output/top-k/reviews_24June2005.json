It's a simple explanation for the movie, but not quite accurate. There are complex characters within and what's right and wrong is supposed to seem clear cut, but isn't. The viewer is left to judge along with Lonnie Bannon (Brandon de Wilde) to decide.Right off the bat, we are introduced to Hud Bannon who is the top local drinker, fighter and womanizer. I didn't like his character right off, but Paul Newman plays Hud in a way that makes him appealing and interesting despite the major character flaws. Lonnie Bannon is taken aback by his Uncle Hud's brazen behavior getting him in hot water with the husband of the woman Hud is having an affair with. He's angry, but not hateful and Hud's smart and smooth talking ways quickly take the edge off.Soon after, we meet Homer Bannon and it's a different story with him. He definitely has a chip against Hud and as the movie unfolds, we find out what that is despite Hud being his son. Their relationship is basically broken, but we do not find the truth out until later.We find out Lonnie loves his Grand Dad Homer, but is placed in the middle between his traditional, principled Grand Dad and his Uncle Hud's free wheeling unprincipled ways. Lonnie admires his uncle, but eventually is forced to decide what is right and wrong as Homer told him.Homer makes his living running a small Texas ranch. He has to work hard, and is able to keep it running with the help of Hud, Lonnie, their cook and housekeeper Alma and some ranch hands. The ranch serves as the background for Homer's traditional and ethical values. He treats others as he would like to be treated. He possesses some admirable qualities, but it is not enough to keep him out of financial trouble when one of his cattle comes down with a fatal and contagious disease.Hud has other ideas and gives a cynical view of government and how they treat people when it comes to the law. Hud is quite self serving and just looking out for his own interests, but he makes a compelling case for not letting government bureaucrats tell them how to run his business and how his Dad and him could get out of the potential mess they could soon face. In regards to the law, Hud says, Well, I've always thought the law was meant to be interpreted in a lenient manner. Sometimes I lean one way and sometimes I lean the other.Throughout the movie, one can sympathize with Hud even though he may a callous, selfish individual. Paul Newman is great in pulling this off. He continually alienates the ones that are close to him, but they cannot be totally be put off by Hud. It's not like they do not see Hud's point of view and completely disagree with him even though it may not match the moral and principled views of his father.By the end of the movie, I would think the viewer has taken a thoroughly negative view of Hud and like Lonnie ends up going against and leaving him. Hud just shrugs it off and we are left with a pathetic and sad view of Hud.

Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) is the struggling puppeteer with no job, so after seeing an advert for needed quick fingers, he goes to start work at Lestercorp, on floor 7½ as a filing clerk. As he continues working there, he not only becomes attracted to co-worker Maxine Lund (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Catherine Keener), but he finds a secret portal into the head of actor John Malkovich (himself) for 15 minutes.

After experiences inside Maljovich where he meets and makes love to Maxine, Lotte is having thoughts about her sexual gender and identity, i.e. she's basically turned gay, and Maxine can respond with her (only through Malkovich).

Keaton is great as Batman as in the other ones, but Val Kilmer is very sexy, and every bit as dark as Keaton. One thing that set this film apart from the other ones is the villains. The Riddler and Two-Face where hilariously sinister together, and there are great lines in the entire thing (I am Batman! Black rubber. Try firemen, less to take off. Holy rusted metal batman! If you kill him, you won't learn nothing'. Etc.) OK, I'm not ripping on Michael Keaton or anything, I love those movies, but for different movies. I love those for the darkness and evil that they involve, but this, I love this one because, because I had FUN watching it. They other ones I didn't exactly have fun. I enjoyed those very much, but on the fun and laughter scale.....ziltch. This one had comedy, drama, and a tad of romance, enough to factor in with the story but not interfere with the whole Batman transition.First off, VAL KILMER! Sexy in the suit. The reason why he is such a good Batman is that he has such a great voice. I think that is vital to a Batman. Second, in this movie you like Batman\/Bruce Wayne as a person. He's much more deep and humanized in this film. You come to like him and Robin\/Dick Grayson as a team, and understand the reasons why they are a team.Second, Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones! Great villains! In Batman Returns(1990), I was really disappointed in the villains. They wanted to kill Batman. The End. No reason, no vengeance, no anger. We get the fact that The Riddler is a control freak who is peeved that Bruce Wayne woulden't listen to his ideas for mind-control. We understand that Two-Face wants to kill Batman because.........that's self-explanatory. I'm not a fan of Jim Carrey, but his character is funny, and pshycotic. Tommy Lee Jones is a great Two-Face, hilariously flipping his coin and being generally homicidal.

Not to mention the acting from Randy Quaid was surprising, I guess he was good in his early years.The only bad thing I have to say about the movie is that the audience is dealing with a character, Billy, who did commit a crime, which can make it hard to root for him. So when the court changes his sentence after serving three years it almost feels like that is the director's only way in getting the audience to feel for the character. There was also a quick scene of homosexuality, which I thought the film could have done without, especially since the other character wasn't even one of Billy's close friends.

The most frequent reason in my opinion is that some just don't 'get it'. While busy focusing on pointing out rather trivial and nit-picky things, they are so far off the central point and weight of what the film is truly offering that the most rewarding aspects are lost on them.Firstly, a very interesting and off center look into survival in the wilderness. Unconventional in the way that any alternate -in what I would consider Hollywood- version of this film would feature mostly everything taking place in that exotic cabin where this menacing digital bear(s) cuts the power and kills people off one by one because they left food out. Instead we are taken deep into the wilderness for real, with no comfort or near-by home base to return to. Decisions made don't feel forced, they feel natural and logical. At no point was I compelled to yell obscenities at the screen protesting character stupidity(leg cut excluded). Much of the Bear chase presented immediate solutions, with no choice to the point where the most illogical choice -to actually make a stand and kill this bear- becomes the ONLY choice, for all other options have expired.Secondly, upon close inspection of the performances, the acting is spot on. I'd call the performances far from wooden! I think they were heart-felt, high-energy, and consistent. Of course, if you aren't paying attention, certainly it would seem as though Alec Baldwin's character, Bob, shifts toward the end as he 'turns' on Anthony Hopkins' character, Charles, with his attempt to kill him. However, it doesn't take much more than an above 8th grade level of comprehension to get that Bob has been cynically plotting to kill Charles far before the film even begins. That scene in the cabin was simply his chance to finally unburden his feelings toward the situation and justify what he was about to do(made final by the For All The Nights discovery). Upon watching the film a second time through, it's evident that Bob was able to suppress the impending deed (which in my opinion was something he thought he HAD to do in the end) for the more imminent task of survival, and even taking those feelings and burying them for the time being.There is also an interesting element of male bonding in the face of adversity-not overcoming the vices and evils that cement Bob to his ultimate deed. Also impressive was the extensive knowledge, yet honest innocence of Charles being something of a recluse from conventional thinking. To the end giving Bob the benefit of the doubt as a man worth preserving; such a sad tale of a very lonely, rich man(never feel sorry for a man that owns a plane); indeed two men who through this experience could have been friends if not for the complexity of their 'other' lives back in civilization. That said, Bob's reasoning was justified to Bob and I could understand his position and motives.Bobs confrontation of Charles in the clearing tells a very deep rooted stereotype he has for the wealthy class, not really getting that Charles was at the very least an exception to that rule if not a shining example of what was the better human being. In any case Bob felt as though he was entitled to Mickey more-so than Charles, even implying that Mickey and he would be together if not for Charles' wealth. This hatred remained too deep to ignore even after their experience.And I'm sorry, but to see that fundamental stand-up and confidence chant (what one man can do another can do) despite lingering fear in Bobs face gets me saying hell yeah each and every time. One of the party having already suffered death and devouring by this behemoth, the fight was believable as rational thought ended up being the key. Horribly outmatched, they owed a lot to courage and luck. In my opinion the film became sobering upon the death of their friend by the bear, and I always breath a sigh of relief watching that bear laying there dead, the two exhausted men leaning against it, out of breath, as we swallow what we just went through.Thus, survival at that point was over and resolved in my opinion. These men could survive in the wilderness having passed what I thought to be an ultimate test. I also believe that, after the bear slaying, more time had elapsed than a lot of reviewers give credit for. The fact that they made clothing, food, and other things out of the bear to me marked the passage of a good deal of time.What I also saw was a very natural and gradual unraveling of their character as the experience wore on them, until the core of things finally prevailed in the end. And it wasn't the deceit or even the cheating. It was in the end about two men, one dying (justly) yet somehow I felt sad to see him go. Because on what turned out to be his death bed, he offered Mickey's innocence in this business of doing Charles in. An act of virtue from a character who had previously only acted in his own interest got to me. Plus Charles' bond to him was enough to put me on his side and root for this attempted murderer to live.In my opinion the depth, scope, and insight into darker aspects of the human condition go largely unnoticed in this film, for people go in expecting bears, Baldwin, and Hollywood and usually only see what they expect to see. No more, no less. I feel that this film was nicely filled out, packed with little things I loved and fundamental things that moved and entertained me. I hate to see relatively high-brow stuff being overlooked and passed off as low-brow, but I suppose The Edge remains a sleeper.

The thing that makes it worse is that they have all done good work in the past that is good but here they don't even seem to be trying.Then there is the direction. Has there ever been a more incompetent director than Berry Summerfield? The Plot is just awful.Doctor Loveless(who in the TV show was a great character with Richard Keel as a henchman)is now a guy in a wheelchair who wants to use a gaint robot spider(That there is no way he could build in the 1860s)to kidnap the President and take over the west.

The murder of MI6 Station Agent Commander Strangways and his titian-haired secretary by three fake blind men begins an espionage thriller as the opening moves in a mental chess match that eventually pits the resourceful Bond against Doctor No, agent of SMERSH and ruthless cat-loving maniac. The first introduction of Bond in a gambling casino here is masterful; his laconic one-liner speech style and independence of mind refreshing at all points. Sent to Jamaica, he makes contact with his American counterpart, the first of a series of Felix Leiters, Jack Lord, and Quarrel, the local boat captain who had been escorting Strangways on his investigations of mysterious goings-on at Crab Key--which we learn is Julius No's HQ. Others in the cast besides Connery, who is the quintessential Bond to most aficionados of the series, include Anthony Dawson as a nervous villain, John Kitzmiller as a creditable Quarrel, and Peter Burton.

It also is about his whole family just finding what truly makes them happy, no matter what anyone else says or does, they do what makes them happy which in turn makes them happy and slowly all of the things that used to matter before like reputation and conformity disappear. this movie is an exploration of the human soul and the human need for happiness.

If you have ever seen this disaster then you must understand on some level why I would say that. Viewing this film is one of the most haunting, disgusting, and painful experiences I have ever faced, yet I see people giving it glowing reviews and decent scores. Perhaps that is more frightening than the movie itself.If you haven't seen it yourself, feel lucky and blessed. It is a bizarre exploration of the most torturous images and sounds ever. With each unsettling and grotesque scene combined with aggravating machinery sounds or the mutant baby gurgling and crying, or both, the movie does everything in its power to revolt the audience. Some people seem to thing that this movie is like Lynch's experiment, and his main goal was to horrify the audience. If that's the case then he was blindingly successful, but that in no way makes it a good film or him a good director. It makes him a sick director, and this a bad...oh god...a bad, utterly bad film. Lynch obviously didn't realize that movies are a form of entertainment, not physical and mental torture. This film and its relationship with the world is much like this Imagine you're given a painting by a famous painter, and that painting is hailed as a genius work of artistic experimentation. Now imagine the painting is a series of the most terrible images ever, and part of the creative genius of the painter was to splatter feces on it. Now ask yourself this, would hang this hailed masterpiece in your home...would you even want to be near it? Of course not. Despite the title of great art given to it, you know it's still horrifying images covered in reeking waste.

I have seen more than my fair share of movies, some of which I would call utterly terrible. But even the worst movies can be so bad they are funny. This movie shatters those boundaries and steps fully into hellishly bad. There is nothing even remotely entertaining or forcedly funny about it. It is simply an exercise in soul crushing pain, that left me depressed and nauseated. Not just because it was the worst thing ever, but because it single-handedly proves that there is no God.

If you plan to watch it for your own reasons, you will regret it. My advice is if anyone ever approaches you and suggest watching Eraserhead (even if that person is your best friend or mother), punch them in the face as hard as you can and run away as fast as you can, for you can be certain that that person is delirious or most certainly has bodies buried in the dirt floor of a cellar.

This film almost has everything you could ask for - Comedy, Action, Horror, even a little bit of romance - and, of course, more catchy one-liners than you can shake a boomstick at.The story goes that Ash and a few friends of his trek up to a rickety old cabin in the woods - wherein they discover an ancient log from a researcher who studied The Book of the Dead - the Necronomicon. After unwittingly unleashing a horrible evil, one by one, everybody is either killed - or becomes part of the evil themselves. The evil even begins to infect Ash, through his hand - which he cuts off at the wrist. In a final moment of desperation, Ash recites an incantation from the Book, hoping to re-seal the evil. Unfortunately for him, things are never that easy... a vortex opens, swallowing the cabin, Ash, and all his belongings.Once he comes out the other side, he discovers he has been transported to Medieval times, where his appearance was prophesied to bring salvation from the deadites - the very creatures he tried to vanquish in the woods that night. The only way he can get back home is by retrieving the very book that started the mess The Necronomicon. Ash accepts the quest, but only so he can get sent home again - but in doing so, he once again unleashes a terrible evil; an evil that wants it's book back.This movie is just really well made. The comedy and the action blend almost perfectly. Ash makes his transformation quite well - after surviving what can almost literally be described as Hell (Evil Dead 2), Ash emerges in this movie as brave, confident, strong, and perhaps a little insane - ready to face any battle the Deadites throw at him, with Shotgun and Chainsaw in hand. There are some inconsistencies involving certain events in the film (the items Ash keeps in the trunk of his car, for example), but given the over-the-top nature of the rest of the movie - it only adds to the feeling of fun radiating from the entire production. Evil Dead's B-Movie roots grow deep, and Army of Darkness, if anything, only lampoons and emphasizes that fact even more, with 100ft jets of blood exploding from pits, ninja-agility deadites, and three stooges parodies.Even if you haven't seen Evil Dead or Evil Dead 2, Army of Darkness provides a pretty in-depth flashback sequence when the film starts - making it recommended viewing for anybody anywhere.

CC was an aspiring singer hoping to make the big time, and Hillary enjoyed her friend's talent, and they both made a promise to stay in touch through letters. Years later, CC (a great Bette Midler) is a selfish, quite lippy and almost lazy woman still trying to earn a living, and Hillary (Barbara Hershey) is a successful lawyer, and they are both delighted to see each other again, almost by chance. They stick by each other for a long time as they try to sort their individual lives out. CC does get to become a successful singer, but with her selfishness she does cause a breakup for a while. When they do forgive each other, and Hillary has her daughter, they stick to each other till the end. As years pass, daughter Victoria Cecilia Essex (Grace Johnston) and CC have to face the terrible revelation of Hillary's fatal virus, and CC knows she has to stay till her death, and then look after Victoria. Also starring John Heard as John Pierce, Spalding Gray as Dr. Richard Milstein, Lainie Kazan as Leona Bloom and James Read as Michael Essex. Bette Midler steals the show, not just with her acting, but also for her good singing. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration.
