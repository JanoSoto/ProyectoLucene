Spoilers!!!I feel that it's hard to judge romantic comedies. They will never win an Oscar, right? Would you consider Shakespeare in Love a romantic comedy? It won an Oscar over Saving Private Ryan and that was quite a shocker. As much as I loved Shakespeare, I felt Saving was much more deserving. However, I think that belief just goes back to my initial comment. I'm not a professional film critic so it's hard to judge romantic comedies and know how to differentiate a mediocre romantic comedy from an amazing one.That being said, this movie might have been mediocre except for the endearing performances of the leads. Julia Roberts seems to have that rare charisma and likability factor that makes you care about her especially when she's in a sweet movie such as this one. However, I feel she's upstaged by Cameron Diaz in this movie. I'm not a big Cameron fan but she is so good in this movie. She makes her Kimmie character sweet and endearing that even though you might be insanely jealous of her character's youthfulness and money, you really want her as your best friend. I love the scene in the karaoke bar. That scene is totally due to Cameron's expertise as an actress. In fact, I've noticed her facial expressions and comedic timing. I hear that is the hardest kind of acting. Forget Charlie's Angels. Watch this movie and see Cameron's talent. One of these days, she will be nominated for an Oscar and may even win one. Rupert Everett is a joy to watch. His character is funny and honest and helps ground Julianne in reality. Dermot Mulroney is a little harder to judge. One piece of information I love about his character is that he loves his job which pays very little and gets no respect. I'm a teacher so I can relate to that except hopefully, teachers do get respect.This movie came out when I was 21 years old. I'll be 30 this year and after watching it recently, there's more that I can relate to. I understand Julianne's urgency to get married and her feelings of being threatened by Kimmie who is still a college student. I feel sorry for Julianne's character because she was never ready for Michael's love and when she was, it was too late. Love and relationships are definitely about timing and even though Julianne doesn't end up with Michael, it makes her a better person and even more ready for her true love.As for Kimmie, I can relate to her because I am a total romantic. When I love someone, I love him wholeheartedly and I see so much passion in Kimmie and Michael is really lucky to have someone like who;s willing to give up so much of her life for him. She may regret it later on in her life but that we will never know. How much traveling does she intend to do with Michael? I imagine it will get old and she will want to settle down. Throughout the movie, she brings up the fact that she totally doesn't want to give up her life. At this time, she is passionately in love and that's all that matters. If we were to see their lives on down the line, it may not be as rosy. Julianne may have lost Michael, but her character is better off than Kimmie, in my opinion.In any case, this movie is about a small piece of time in these people's lives. Most of us can relate to this in one way or another and it's an enjoyable movie to watch. It definitely deserves a higher rating in the IMDb. That goes to show that perhaps we don't know how to grade romantic movies.On a more serious note, a more dramatic movie dealing with lost opportunities and also romantic in its own way is Before Sunset. Check it out if you haven't seen it. It's definitely more thoughtful and dramatic than this one. However, it's definitely more meaningful for those about 27-32 years old.My Best Friend's Wedding is entertaining and undervalued.

Others could be ludicrous, fun, amusing, stupid, etc. You get the idea.Robert Rodriguez took the profits from his first film, El Mariachi, and continued on with the story now with more funds, so he made it glossier, more explosive, added some name actors and, of course, way overdid it, making it almost a cartoon it is so outrageous. He continued this with the third film, Once Upon A Time In Mexico which is even more of the same. If something worked subtly the first time, filmmakers think that to improve on it is by bombarding the audience with it the next time. They don't know when enough is enough and, boy, does that apply to Rodriguez. He does keep you entertained, though, once you check your brains at the door and begin watching the show. However, all this excess makes it lose any credibility El Mariachi might have built up with the first show in this trilogy.Whether the movie is really dumb or its just tongue-in-cheek humor by Rodriguez, it has super-style and fun to watch. Talk about stylish! No wonder Quentin Tarantino and he are good friends and the latter has a guest appearance in the film. They both love having fun with the cameras.The first eight minutes let you know what you are in for outrageousness. It's an 8-minute scene at a bar involving a story told by Steve Buscemi.

The film is based on a true story and is set in Germany in the 1800's. The film is about a man named Kaspar Hauser who was kept locked up in a cellar for many years and was finally released upon society. Not knowing how to speak or write and not knowing anything about the outside world the community of a small German town takes Kaspar under their wing and people let him stay with them and eventually he learns how to speak, write and even play music. Everything changes one day when Kaspar is mysteriously stabbed and later dies. Winner of The FIPRESCI Award, The Grand Prize Of The Jury, and Prize Of The Ecumenical Jury all for writer\/director Werner Herzog at The Cannes Film Festival and The Film Award In Gold for Outstanding Individual Achievement In Editing, Outstanding Individual Achievement In Production Design and The Film Award in Silver for Shaping Of A Feature Film at The German Film Awards. The film has good direction, a good original screenplay, a great performance by Bruno S (who plays Kaspar Hauser) and a good supporting cast, good cinematography, good film editing, good production design and good costume design. The Enigma Of Kaspar Hauser is a fascinating film from start to finish. I was fully engrossed in this film the entire running time and after the film was over it left quite an impact one me. The film is a beautiful looking film and it is very well crafted to look like the 1800's and at times I almost felt like it was the 1800's. I thought Bruno S did a very good job at playing Kaspar Hauser who we the audience eventually learn to like, feel and care for. The film is a very emotional film and also a thought provoking one leaving us wondering about who held Kaspar captive for such a long time and why did they do it. The film never answers these questions and in a way I think I not like knowing better because it makes you think about the film and what you saw more critically and makes you think and analyze the film. This is a beautiful and powerful movie and it is also very sweet and endearing. This is a great film accomplishment and while the film may not be for everybody because of it's slower pace I really appreciated the film and it's style and the overall feeling it left me after I viewed the film.

Now don't get me wrong, the direction is well handled, the acting is great & the special effects (WOW!) is well done by special effects whiz CHRIS WALAS (Who would later helm the second film) but other than that, the film really doesn't do anything to spectacular. There's very little scares present, though there's some good suspenseful scenes. Like I said it was a good movie & worth a glance for horror buffs, but I didn't see where it was so spectacular (Though I may have been expecting to much) I don't think David CRONENBERG (In my opinion) was really the right guy to helm this, in fact Cronenberg supposedly never liked the original Vincent Price movie!...sadly a pointless remake is on the way (sigh!) & a sequel followed in 1989 called naturally, THE FLY II *** stars ","genre":"Drama, Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"10 March 2006","score":"5 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" I love it when a movie captivates me, carries me along, then surprises me at the end.

NATTY GANN is a rather unknown Disney release from 1985 that takes places in the '30's. Natty Gann is a young girl living with just her father in a bleak time. She is rough around the edges and has clearly built up a crocodile skin due to the life she has led. However, at her core, she truly loves her father.So when he is forced to leave her at a moment's notice to travel to Washington (the only place he can find work) Natty is left in the care of a bitter Landlord. It doesn't take long for Natty, played by Meredith Salenger, to runaway in an attempt to travel the 2,000 miles to be with her father again.On her journey, Natty meets all kinds of people who are suffering due to the nation's economic situation. One thing she witnesses is a dogfight where one of the dog's is a rather wild wolf. Natty reaches out for the wolf though and eventually manages to establish a bond with the wild animal. Together, they continue to travel towards her Washington State in pursuit of Natty's father.As the plot description above makes clear, the framework of this film is not horribly unique or important. However, what does give the film some extra quality is the approach in which the material is taken on.This film is very much in the same vein as another under-appreciatted Disney classic, RETURN TO OZ. This is a very dark family film that lacks all of the standard, corny Disney clichés (aside from the animal friend, but here he doesn't talk... and he isn't particularly nice at first).THE JOURNEY OF NATTY GANN portrays the depression-era and it's effects on the poor very honestly. We see Natty eating out of garbage pales and sleeping in filth. We see the type of work her father is forced to take on. And we see the bitterness and resentment Natty feels towards her situation.She is not your typical hopelessly-optimistic Disney heroine. She gets angry, she defends herself, and she doesn't make excuses. She starts fight, even smokes what appears to be weed in the opening scene (this was something I certainly didn't notice as a child). However, the role of Natty is always grounded by an appealing and fully realized performance from the young Meredith Salenger. She hasn't found much success in film following this movie, but it is definitely one of the best child performances of the 80's.Now aside from the good qualities of the film, THE JOURNEY OF NATTY GANN moves a little too slow for me to really love it. Despite the many Disney clichés it avoids, it's still always obvious Natty will find her father and all will be happy. So the fact that it takes 105 minutes to do so is a bit much. And there is a supporting role \/ love interest played by John Cusack who is essentially useless to the plot.But Disney deserves some credit for boldly taking family films to a darker, more artistically developed place in 1985 (both RETURN TO OZ and NATTY GANN were released in that year). There haven't been children's films that really embrace the darker side of things like these 2 films do since '85... and these under-viewed films deserve a little more credit and public acknowledgment for looking outside of the lines in a genre that is too often trapped within the lines....

But this is of course a movie for adults and justifies it's 18 rating as it does contain a few shock moments, most notably the ending which although breaks a taboo is handled quite beautifully. Nevertheless there is so many visual treats shown throughout this movie, from the dark atmospheric reaction close ups on Jack's face which are accompanied by that heart string tearing music, to Jack's surreal seaside past dreams\/flash-back sequences and not to mention the mothers death, which is upsetting enough to see and feel the youngsters loss, but when Jack and Julie have to move her body it's hard to keep a dry eye at the sight of Jack's despair and as always the movie score builds to see that. There's also the excellent camera work used to highlight the urban ruin that is their home\/surroundings and the long shots of the children (notably Jack) walking to and from school are awe inspiring. OK I could go on but that would be a spoiler and you need to watch this movie to really appreciate it anyway.So overall this movie does much more than bring Ian McEwan's novel to the screen and although it has some uncomfortable to watch scenes it is on the whole a very beautiful film which has the effect of growing on you and becomes more enjoyable with each viewing, something you can't say for many films made nowadays. It also truly deserves to be given the label of British Classic as it's been made with such care and to such a high standard with the excellent actors, the astounding musical score, the awe inspiring camera-work and of course the award winning story itself, I really can't praise it highly enough.The only disappointing aspect of this release by Cinema Club is the lack of extras offered, it would have been nice to have a commentary from the main cast as would seeing them reunited to offer their views and memories of the movie. A feature on the making of the movie would have been great, perhaps showing the location used in London and how it appears today and a music only option highlighting the awe inspiring orchestrated musical score would have been a treat too. There's also a rumour that a large scene was deleted from the movie, so having the option to view that would have been nice. Then there's the picture quality, which is of a good standard even when viewed on a large wide-screen TV although it does appear slightly grainy if viewed close up so I doubt it got much of a digital re-mastered makeover and the soundtrack is also good here offered in Dolby Digital Stereo but it would have been so much better if it was in 5.1. OK maybe I'm nitpicking and a second disc full of extras might be a pipe dream but that would have been excellent all the same and who knows maybe one day that will happen.In any case for now it's an absolute treat that Cinema Club has made this movie available on DVD and so don't just take my word for it, buy it and let it attack your senses too, you won't be disappointed and if you don't feel touched by the visuals and music of this powerful drama then your not human.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"10 March 2006","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" This amazing ground breaking film is based on Ian McEwan's award winning novel about four children (2 who are in their late teen's) who after the death of their mother fear foster homes and separation and as such keep the death a secret and withdraw into their own shadowy world and whilst that novel is an excellent read, this film offers so much, much more...For a start it features excellent actors including Sinead Cusack who expertly plays the mother, but the real stars of this film are the children Jack, Julie, Sue and Tom with Jack played by Andrew Robertson and Julie played by Charlotte Gainsbourg both being the main focus of the film and who are both incredibly photogenic and simply steal the show proving what fantastically accomplished young actors they really are.Then there's the films musical score which is absolutely astounding, it's haunting for the best part of the film and tears at your heartstrings at times but it simply oozes atmosphere throughout and just adds to the overall surreal effect of this movie and is the best orchestrated score I have ever heard.Then there's the film itself, which will be familiar if you've read the book, it's commonly thought to be set during the long hot summer of 1976, hottest summer on record being mentioned during the course of the movie but the fashions\/styles are more of a 1960's\/1970's pastiche. But this is of course a movie for adults and justifies it's 18 rating as it does contain a few shock moments, most notably the ending which although breaks a taboo is handled quite beautifully. Nevertheless there is so many visual treats shown throughout this movie, from the dark atmospheric reaction close ups on Jack's face which are accompanied by that heart string tearing music, to Jack's surreal seaside past dreams\/flash-back sequences and not to mention the mothers death, which is upsetting enough to see and feel the youngsters loss, but when Jack and Julie have to move her body it's hard to keep a dry eye at the sight of Jack's despair and as always the movie score builds to see that. There's also the excellent camera work used to highlight the urban ruin that is their home\/surroundings and the long shots of the children (notably Jack) walking to and from school are awe inspiring. OK I could go on but that would be a spoiler and you need to watch this movie to really appreciate it anyway.So overall this movie does much more than bring Ian McEwan's novel to the screen and although it has some uncomfortable to watch scenes it is on the whole a very beautiful film which has the effect of growing on you and becomes more enjoyable with each viewing, something you can't say for many films made nowadays. It also truly deserves to be given the label of British Classic as it's been made with such care and to such a high standard with the excellent actors, the astounding musical score, the awe inspiring camera-work and of course the award winning story itself, I really can't praise it highly enough.The only disappointing aspect of this release by Cinema Club is the lack of extras offered, it would have been nice to have a commentary from the main cast as would seeing them reunited to offer their views and memories of the movie. A feature on the making of the movie would have been great, perhaps showing the location used in London and how it appears today and a music only option highlighting the awe inspiring orchestrated musical score would have been a treat too. There's also a rumour that a large scene was deleted from the movie, so having the option to view that would have been nice. Then there's the picture quality, which is of a good standard even when viewed on a large wide-screen TV although it does appear slightly grainy if viewed close up so I doubt it got much of a digital re-mastered makeover and the soundtrack is also good here offered in Dolby Digital Stereo but it would have been so much better if it was in 5.1. OK maybe I'm nitpicking and a second disc full of extras might be a pipe dream but that would have been excellent all the same and who knows maybe one day that will happen.In any case for now it's an absolute treat that Cinema Club has made this movie available on DVD and so don't just take my word for it, buy it and let it attack your senses too, you won't be disappointed and if you don't feel touched by the visuals and music of this powerful drama then your not human.
