I was wrong.  This movie gets started in one direction, and then proceeds to dance around in place while nothing important happens.I felt that I could have left the movie, walked around the lobby for an hour, returned and have missed nothing at all.The movie opens at a party hosted by Victor Ziegler (Sydney  Pollack). Dr. Bill Hartford (Tom Cruise) and Alice Hartford (Nicole Kidman) are introduced as a couple who in the company  of others who are a bit more affluent then themselves.   Apparently, Bill is friends with Victor and gets invited to  these parties every year.  We never learn how or why Victor and Bill are friends.We do learn that Bill is in fact a doctor who's not a jealous man until his wife tells him that she had a fantasy once  about being with another man she saw.  Then Bill decides it's time to roam the streets and encounter every sexually skewed person on the planet as he tries desperately to cheat on his wife.  You don't learn much else about Bill except that he did in fact go to medical school, as evidenced by the fact that he runs into an old friend from med-school who dropped out.  His friend, Nick Nightengale, is not developed much either.Alice Hartford (Nicole Kidman) plays opposite Cruise as his wife.  We never learn much about her either, except that she's a flirt when she's drunk, she likes to smoke weed, and she's really upset that her husband doesn't think that she would  cheat on him.  Oh yeah, there is some mentioned interest in art and I think we see her looking through the want ads for  a job once.The two have a daughter in the movie who's only purpose is to  prove to you that Bill and Alice have actually been  married for the stated nine years without having to actually explain any of their past.  In fact, we learn nothing about their relationship whatsover.  Keep in mind, that their  relationship is the supposed crux of this movie.  The climax of the movie is when Bill ends up at a secret sex party where everyone is masked and cloaked.  He is immeadiately recognized by a hooker who he had briefly helped the night before when she was drunk and high on heroin and cocaine. How she recognized Bill through his cloak and mask despite only have met him once in an extremely foggy (near-overdose) state is beyond me.  Eventually, his true identity is exposed at the party and Bill's life may be in  danger (you're not sure because you never told who's at the party and what their capable of).  The hooker comes to Bill's rescue and sacrifices herself for his sake.  The climax is later undone as Victor explains that the whole identity exposing, life-threatening scene may have in fact been staged just to scare him.  You never learn one way or the other what the truth is.The movie has a fitting ending as Bill ends up confessing all that has transposed to Alice and she tells him that they  need to f*ck. This was one of the worst movies I have seen in quite a while. Even if you are curious about this movie, I urge you to save your money.

I loved it back then because there were so many cool actors in it.  That is why, nothing more and nothing less.  But now, as I am a young adult perhaps going through some of the same scenarios and fears and insecurities that these people are in the movie, I can appreciate it a whole lot more.  Not only is it a film that has an incredible young cast in it, but it is a film that does a great job of dealing with a plethora of issues.  My favourite character was Billy, the Rob Lowe character.  Sometimes his intentions weren't always spelled out for us, but there are subleties about the way he plays his character that really hit home.  You can tell that he misses the easier days of college.  The days where all he had to do was play sports and smoke up a bit.  But now he is in real life and he can't quite seem to find his niche.  He is still the good looking playboy that can get laid whenever he feels like it, but as for dealing with real life issues, he is confused and scared.  And he masks that insecurity by being a playboy.  It's a great character study.  Many of the other characters in the film have interesting stories as well.  None of them have quite figured out what the meaning of life is yet and all of them are kind of living on the edge.  All are attempting to get by with what they have, but what it ultimately comes down to is that none of them really knows the answers. Maybe some have become more successful than others but deep down they are all scared of life.  Now I don't know about other mid 20's people, but I can sure relate to what they are feeling and going through.  And this movie made me feel like I am not the only one that may not have all the answers.  If this is a film that you haven't seen in a few years, watch it.  Admire what it wants to say.

And it was. The sad thing was, this movie got laughs, but not when they intended to get laughs.  Like when the phantom house makes a harp string hit a woman in the eye, the audience was howling, and a painting of the man who lived in the mansion looks like a cross between Jack Nicholson and a werewolf, which also got laughs.  The movie is actually quite good, until Lili Taylors character starts to begin to think she's 'been chosen to protect the children'.  Then everyone in the audience got restless, and you could hear alot of 'Aw, come on..'.  Another ill-thought out part is when Taylor asks Neeson about when he called her, and he says he didnt call.

How would you react if you knew that there was no way you were going to survive what was about to happen?  Would you want to survive what was about to happen?  Deep Impact is an excellent film that tells the story of a giant comet that is heading towards earth and unless it is stopped it will destroy everything.  It contains many inter-personal relationships, and it examines how people would react if the end was near.  It doesn't get as deep as Last Night at examining those issues, but what it does better than Last Night and even Armageddon ( another film that I loved ) is it shows a little more about relationships.  It has a father and daughter trying to patch things up before the end is upon them.  It shows young love, parental love and the love for a country and the world we live in.  Deep Impact had a deeper impact on me and I really admire both Hollywood summer films that came out and dealt with this issue.  But Deep Impact has more to say than Armageddon does.One of the things that I admired so much about this film was how Tea Leoni was so hell bent on uncovering a story so that she could move up in the ranks of reporting, and in the process she uncovers something bigger than any political scandal could ever be.  At first she is following a tip about some senator that has retired from office rather urgently.  She has transcripts with him talking about a girl named Ellie.  And she is determined to uncover who Ellie is so she can embarrass the senator and quicken her pursuit to greatness.  She finally confronts the senator on the dock where he is laoding a boat with what looks to be enough supplies to last for a year.  She tries to bully the senator into telling her the story but he refuses.  She then does some research on the Internet and finds out that Ellie wasn't the name of a woman, but an acronym for the comet. E.L.E. Extinction Level Event.  She is horrified.  The beginning takes up a good half an hour of the movie and it is during that thirty mintues that I became hooked.  My emotions were manipulated to the point where I felt like I should  be at home with my family.  The direness of the situation was very well executed.  And the rest of the film is on the same level.  It does a great job at making us ask questions about ourselves.  And we examine our own lives and wonder if we would be prepared if something like this ever happened.  I realize this may be getting a little sentimental and perhaps sappy, but this film really tapped into my emotions and I think it did that to a lot of people.  I highly recommend htis film for all that it is.  The acting is top notch, especially from Morgan Freeman.  He conveys the hurt, confusion and utter regret as the president of the United States.  He knows that it is impossible to save everyone but he has to do what he can to save as many as possible.  He truly is a great and gifted actor.  The score is also a moving orchestra and the direction by Mimi Leder is swift and appropriatly crisp and dizzying in some ways.  I have never heard of her before this, but I heard that Spielberg picked her himself for this project. And he was smart to pick her.  She really does a wonderful job here.Deep Impact is more than just a movie, it is an experience, and one that should be had by all.  A wonderful, wonderful film.

My only complaint is why did Edward Burns have to include Jennifer Aniston in the cast??? Was he trying to use the banal relationship tones of Friends to liven up the story??? He only succeeded in dampening it a bit. But I must say, it wasn't hard for viewers to understand why Aniston couldn't sexually entice her husband. Many critics haven't been fair to Maxine Bahns (who was Edward Burns's girlfriend at the time) and Mike McGlone (who is one of Burns's closest, if not best, friend). It's true that they were in The Brothers McMullen and were placed in high roles in this film for capitalistic and nepotistic reasons, but since they're so well suited for the parts, it isn't surprising nor disturbing. McGlone is excellent as the brash, successful younger brother whose career is sky high but is stuck in a bad marriage. And Maxine Bahns is very likable and talented, portraying a free spirited graduate student who works in a bar and lives in a small apartment. As far as the more famous players are concerned, Burns should be commended for choosing Cameron Diaz, a rising star, to play the voloptuous vixen. For those who are used to seeing her in her lighter roles (The Mask, There's Something about Mary, A Life Less Ordinary) you'll be surprised to see how dazzling she is here. And watch for John Mahoney (Frasier's dad) as the boys' eccentric, though understanding father, and Frank Vincent (who played tough enforcers in 3 of Scorcese's mob movies!!!) as McGlone's candid father in law.

The address on Oswald's pamphlets did lead to an address adjacent to Guy Banister's detective agency, but the entrance listed did not lead into Guy Banister's office, they are completely different offices, completely unconnected.  Thus the connection between Banister and Oswald is not valid.  Also, Kevin Bacon's character was not a real person but combination of three different personalities, and this character never had any evidence which linked Oswald, Ferrie, or Clay Shaw.  These inaccuracies are pretty significant when we relate them to Garrison's case.We all have heard about the Grassy Knoll, and the puff of smoke that was seen from it.  Stone recreated this shot and we see the smoke rising from the rifle, the smoke that Lee Bowers claims to have seen from his train tower.

Also, Kevin Bacon's character was not a real person but combination of three different personalities, and this character never had any evidence which linked Oswald, Ferrie, or Clay Shaw.  These inaccuracies are pretty significant when we relate them to Garrison's case.We all have heard about the Grassy Knoll, and the puff of smoke that was seen from it.  Stone recreated this shot and we see the smoke rising from the rifle, the smoke that Lee Bowers claims to have seen from his train tower.  However, automatic rifles do not give off smoke, that is fact.  This is another significant discrepancy in the investigation.I do not support the single bullet theory, I do not feel strongly about whether or not there was a conspiracy, I just want to know what happened.  I really enjoyed JFK and I am glad to have seen it because it inspired me to do some research on the subject.  I think it did raise some great points about Oswald such as the fact that he was not a great shot, and he also would have had better aim had he fired before Kennedy's car made the turn by the Depository.  I think there are still a lot of questions to be answered.  For example, the shots were taken over 8 to 9 seconds (Warren Commission).  That's a lot of time.  Why couldn't Kennedy have been saved in this time, before the fatal head shot?

Where as scientists tell us that global warming is the result of smokestacks and deforestization and factories, this film has other ideas.  And the ones that are in here are a little more frightening than what the scientists think. Think for one second all that has happened over the last decade or so. Think of all the ecological changes that we are facing right now.  These crisis are all a result of our greed and our industrializaton, which in a way can be a euphanism of greed.  And this film takes all that we know about ozones and animal extinction and global warming and such and puts its own little spin on it.  What if a species that is greater than us has looked at what we are and decided that we are too stupid to take care of our own planet so they will take it away from us.  After all, according to the theories that this movie subscribes to, we are wasting and destroying this planet anyway, why not speed up the process?Charlie Sheen stars as an astronomer who thinks he hears a definitive signal from outer space.  But when he brings it to his boss he learns that due to budget cut backs his department is being eliminated.  So his signal theory falls on deaf ears.  But from here on out the movie becomes almost Hitchcockian in the way that you have a character that knows something that no one will believe, not his superiors, not his girlfriend, not even his friends.  And so it is up to him to try and find a way to convince everyone that he is not crazy and that he is telling the truth.  And what makes this film work so well is two things really.  The first being the story that was written David Twohy.  He also wrote The Fugitve so we know right away he is a good writer.  Here he has some excellent characters and crisp dialogue for them to speak.  The script is a real positive here.  But the second thing about this film that really makes it work is the portrayal that Sheen gives of Zane.  Sheen always looks confused and amazed at the same time.  He can't believe what it is that he has uncovered and his expressions and his mannerisms really do his character justice.  I can honestly say that the last time I saw fear like this from anyone that saw aliens first hand was in James Cameron's incredible 1986 film Aliens.  It has taken ten years for someone else to get an actor to show true fear when it comes to the subject of ETs.  Most films have the stars crack clever jokes about the aliens that they are meeting for the first time.  They rarely show fear but in The Arrival, Sheen is always afraid.  He is never shown as anything more than a normal human being that has uncovered an ugly truth about the true agenda of what the aliens are realy up to.  His performance is one of the best things about this film.The Arrival is intense.  It doesn't stop for a breather too often and it is very intelligent.  It has interesting opinions and it also makes you question our own intentions when it comes to the well being of our planet. Most people passed this one over when it came out because Independence Day came out a mere month later, but as good as ID4 was, this is a different kind of movie.  It is more serious and has an opinion on some very political issues.  It never runs out of steam and it is very entertaining.  I highly recommend that you give it a chance.
