I mean I think the ending is supposed to evoke memories of the original classic Statue of Liberty twist ending by again including a instantly recognisable world renowned iconic monument but no matter how many times you think about it or how many explanations you can come up with it doesn't make a blind bit of sense & will leave most of us scratching our heads in confusion. Again based on the novel Monkey Planet by Pierre Boulle this remake follows the original's basic first half premise fairly closely, astronaut crash lands on a planet where traditional roles are reversed as Apes are the dominant species & man considered the mere animal before all sorts of religious & moral issues raise their heads, this doesn't have the biting satire of the original & the moralist is kept to a minimum & dumbed down somewhat but at least it's still there in some form. The second half of the two films is where they differ the most with a huge battle between Apes & humans here & an A to B trek across the forbidden zone, there's a bit of comedy relief here as well while the main villains are different as the original it was a superstitious scientist & here it's a power mad General warmonger. The general idea that all Apes are afraid of water is also a stretch & the way our heroes escape hundreds of Apes is to simply cross a stream since they can't follow. The ending is also different with a definite answer to the origin of the Apes & their history. This remake places heavier emphasis on action & adventure than the original too which is fine I suppose as it's nicely done.Like the original 1968 version the make-up effects are outstanding here, even better in fact with some fantastic Ape make-up that just looks so realistic & utterly convincing as you can even make out details of the actors face beneath the mask's. The CGI computer effects are alright, there are one or two dodgy ones but nothing too major. The fights & action scenes are cool with particular detail given to the Apes like mannerism & movements which look great on screen, unlike the original the Apes here actually act like Apes as the swing in trees, leap high in the air, write with their feet & run on all fours into battle. The tone of the film is also darker than the original with creepy jungles & dark Ape cities.With a supposed $100,000,000 budget (almost twenty times that of the original made just over thirty years previous) this looks great as it should with great effects, sets & production values. The acting is good although Walhberg is given virtually nothing to do while Tim Roth makes for a good bad guy & original star Charlton Heston has a cameo as Roth's father. Kris Kristofferson has a small role as does David Warner.Planet of the Apes is a decent enough remake to a classic sci-fi film, having seen both in the space of a few hours I can honestly say I liked both of them & while seeing similarities between them I could also see differences too. Maybe not as good a film as the original but this is still a worthwhile watch.

Schaffner after J. Lee Thompson who was originally set to direct pulled out to make Mackenna's Gold (1969) this, I suppose, is considered as a true sci-fi classic & as I write this even makes it to number 228 in the IMDb's Top 250 & since this is a forty year old film that's pretty impressive going. The script from Twilight Zone host, creator & head writer Rod Serling & Michael Wilson was based on the novel Monkey Planet by Pierre Boulle although by all accounts refines it a little bit & adds that twist ending which surely everyone now knows, Planet of the Apes is a good solid sci-fi action adventure that uses the role reversal of a dominant Ape society living next to uncivilised wild human tribes to make some nice points about humanity, where we are going & has some strong social satire as well. From unfair trials to the religion versus science debate to prejudice to wanting to destroy what we don't understand to the ultimate devastation of war. Sure it's all good stuff, it's well written & it's very well put together & the fact most of the main character's are talking Apes it's deadly serious & it all works surprisingly well on various levels as a film that entertains & social satire that has meaning. Some of the sci-fi elements don't add up though, I don't believe the concept of time travel as described here & after a thousand odd years would that doll still be in perfect working order? Also I just don't believe Taylor wouldn't have guessed he was on Earth, I mean there are people there, Apes there, the technology is the same & the trees, sky water & terrain is exactly the same too so it wouldn't exactly take a genius to realise or even make an educated guess. Then there's that iconic twist ending, sure it's a great image but the fact everyone knows about it means it might not have the impact it once did & the fact most should realise that this is Earth means it shouldn't really come as much of a surprise. That's a minor quibble though in an otherwise very good sci-fi film that probably just about deserves it's classic status.The one outstanding area of Planet of the Apes is the Oscar winning make-up effects which are really very impressive even forty years later, the effects are very convincing & while not as good as the remake (no matter what anyone tells you) they hold up extremely well. There are some well staged action scenes too, in particular the sequence about thirty minutes in when the Apes attack & kill numerous humans while on horseback complete with memorable images of the Apes standing over the dead bodies of several humans posing for photographs. The opening as the three astronaut's walk through the harsh desert is also well shot & you can almost feel the heat & isolation. An extremely popular film at the time Planet of the Apes spawned four sequels, Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970), Escape from the Planet of the Apes (1971), Conquest of the Planet of the Apes (1972) & Battle for the Planet of the Apes (1973) as well as the short lived TV series Planet of the Apes (1974) & the animated TV series Return to the Planet of the Apes (1975) before it was remade as a hundred million blockbuster by Tim Burton back in 2001.With a supposed budget of about $5,800,000 this wasn't mega budget but all money went on screen it seems, this is a great looking & designed film. The acting is good especially from those wearing Apes make-up.Planet of the Apes is considered a sci-fi classic & despite one or two minor flaws I would largely have to agree, it's maybe one of those iconic films that everyone should see at least once.
