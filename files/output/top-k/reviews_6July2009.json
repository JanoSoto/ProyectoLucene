In a world too cluttered with garbage, this is a chunk that should head straight for the incinerator. The 1970's was the decade of the baby boomer--and since I am one I think I can say without shame that shooting is too good for the principles in this cheap-shot.Director Robert Benton insists that he made the character of Joanna Kramer sympathetic and believable, and I'm assuming, in retrospect, that Meryl Streep--in this early outing--gave Benton just what he wanted. If she did, then what he wanted was far from sympathetic and believable only as a whining monster--for that is what Joanna Kramer is, a monster who wants it all, no matter what it costs anybody else in her life. I kept hoping for the deus ex machina to come in and strike her dead! Joanna is a cold, unlovable bitch and Meryl did such a good job of portraying her that it took me a long time to look at her in other roles to realize what a wonderful actress she is! Of course she has long since proved her versatility as an actress--the ghastly and unwatchable Mamma Mia! notwithstanding! Hoffman's performance is winning, and if the kid is a bit treacly, well, aren't they supposed to make you say a-w-w-w-w even as you barf? This film, obviously, is not high in my list. Everybody in the cast is better, elsewhere.

Since I am a fan of these films I felt that I needed to see it. Ironically, I viewed this film only a day after the Fourth of July, a national holiday that celebrates the American spirit to the fullest. I can safely say that Glory, a film based off the the true story of the 54th Massachusetts Infantry exemplifies what it truly means to be an American and fit in very appropriately with my Independence Day state of my mind.The Civil War was a dark point in American history. Not only did it force fighting among brothers, it was the deadliest military conflict America has ever engaged in. The goal of the war for President Lincoln was to end slavery in the South, but to ultimately preserve the Union. Glory begins with Matthew Broderick who brilliantly plays the young Col. Robert Shaw at the battle of Antietam where he witnesses the horror of war. Shortly after the disastrous battle, he returns to his home where he is offered the command of an all black regiment, the 54th Massachusetts Infantry. Shaw accepts the offer and the main plot of Glory commences.Broderick is perfect as Shaw because historically Col. Shaw was very young when he took command of the 54th. Broderick perfectly displays a young man who is forced to grow up and lead a group of hundreds of freed black slaves. He attempts to train them like typical Union soldiers and the recruits respond well, but when one recruit named Trip (Denzel Washington) disobeys orders, a severe punishment of flogging sends the whole regiment into painful memories of slavery. It is after Trip's lashing that the unit begins to grow together as one.Glory is a great testament to the racism that plagued our nation during the Civil War. This is best displayed in the scene where Trip gets into a verbal conflict with a white Union soldier. Trip insists to the soldier that the 54th would win the war if they would be allowed to fight but the white soldier disagrees and a shoving match ensues. When I watched this I couldn't believe that racism could make men who were fighting on the same and would ultimately die together so hateful towards each other. This moment causes Trip to be condescending to his fellow regiment members as well for he has lost all confidence that he will ever get to fight for the nation he loves. Sgt. Maj. Rawlins (Morgan Freeman) clues Trip in on the fact that their white comrades fought to free the slaves and by doing so gave them the opportunity to serve in the 54th.The feel good moment of the movie however for me was when the 54th finally earns their right to fight and are included on a siege of Fort Wagner. The 54th knows this is their chance to prove themselves as soldiers and also as men. They volunteer to lead the assault even though they knew that their chance of survival would be low. As they marched through an assembly of white Union soldiers on the day of the attack one of the white men shouts, Give em' hell 54 and the other soldiers join in. This is a triumphant moment in cinema for it is the first time that race was thrown out of the picture because they were together to the end...together they were free men...together they were Americans.By reading this review you should know by now that I am in love with this film and the lessons I learned from it will stick with me forever. It makes one point very clear...hatred will destroy us. It also beautifully shows how men can come together and form incredible bonds that last a lifetime. In the end of the film when the 54th is slaughtered by the Confederates at Fort Wagner they are buried in a mass grave outside the fort. The film first shows Shaw, the privileged white man from Boston, go in the grave. Next to follow him is one of his soldiers. Forever they would rest in that place together. That moment was very moving for me.Once again this film is extraordinary and the acting is superb. I can clearly see how this film jump started Denzel Washington's career because he was amazing as the conflicted Trip. Morgan Freeman was awesome as Rawlins, for once again he was a wise mentor, just like he is in every movie I see him in. It is full of great action sequences and one of the best story lines I have ever witnessed in a war film. If you haven't seen the movie go see it! 10 out of 10! Two thumbs up!

However, just mistaking this as just a gangster film, and not about much more, is a huge mistake. On one level, Shand represents the state of England. Like England, he is tired of the Americans always having the upper hand. He is arrogant, brash, and at the same time tired of being put down and treated as second-class (like the United Kingdom at the time). He knows that there is the lure of an united Europe and the potential profits are tremendous. . On the next level of interpretation, the Irish issue always somehow shoves it's face into the picture. That is the iceberg that Shand has unwittingly hit. His loyal friend (Paul Freeman) from long ago (the Frenchman in Raiders Of The Lost Ark) has accidentally had a deal with some wing of the IRA in Belfast that cost him his life. The audience gasps at the word IRA, because now he has to confront a powerful and well organized rival. As one of Shand's associates says when Shand attempts to confront a group of IRA in London, They are political. These are fanatics!.On another level, the reality of the movie is that Shand's gang is slowly bumped off and his prized pub blown up, Shand slowly starts to find out what really is the cause of the vendetta against him. The movie is also a detective's mystery. Shand becomes Poirot for most of the movie - trying to figure out who really is out to get him. He is as clueless as the audience is. On the next level, this movie is called The Long Good Friday, because it is also a religiously symbolic movie. It takes place on religious holiday. It is about a man who thinks that he is righteous, accidentally kills perhaps his most loyal lieutenant, and then thinks he can cover it up and redeem himself by committing himself to focusing on revenge. But, he can't redeem himself. He has doomed himself by his own sins. It is too late. So,the movie is really about a man who lost his soul in his lust for power, and now deludes himself that he can hold on and justify his power for eternity. However, the unknown is sealing his fate. Isn't the the heart of what Christianity is all about? Lastly, the ending. In the end a young Pierce Brosnan is holding a silencer to him as he gets into a car. The look on Shand's face is the last minute of the film. He says nothing, but you can see every thought and emotion on his face. The only thing that we know about the young assassin played by Brosnan is the credits say he is an Irishman. But that's all we really know. He is probably a member of a rogue element of the IRA that Shand could not possibly account for. However, I think that this is part of the mystery of the movie. All the viewer knows is that some Irish are out to get him. You never really learn their true motives, and who they really are. This movie has a lot of mystery and depth to it. We don't know what it is all about. All we know is that somebody wants to get the most powerful mob boss in London. As I have said, there is a reason the film is entitled Good Friday. It is about a man who confronts his own soul and loses. His bitterness, rage, and ambition cause him to kill lieutenant accidentally with the broken glass of a wine bottle. I don't think that Shand intended to kill his lieutenant named Colin. I think he wanted to teach him a lesson, but he is horrified to see that the bottle he wielded broke and slashed up his lieutenant. You can tell by the look of horror in Shand's face that he is even in disbelief of what rage can do to him. Instead of walking away from his life of crime, Shand is too proud and arrogant. He thinks that he can make up for his brutal accidental murder of Colin by being righteous in revenging himself on his enemies. In this gruesome scene, life's fragility is shown. And even the cold-blooded Shand is horrified by his sin and his lack of control of his anger. And then, like a delusional sinner, he thinks that he can redeem himself by finding out exactly who is out to get him. He thinks that by getting his enemies he will finally find true peace. However, he deludes himself, and in the end he is doomed to die at the hands of the young assassin (Brosnan). In the end, he was undone by his own ambition and foolish pride. And only then does Shand see the full extent of his life of greed and lust. Shand sees that all along he deceived himself into being greater than he really is, and that he could actually escape his own fate in the end. As the film draws to a close you can see that Shand is now resigned to be punished for his sins. ","genre":null},{"date":"6 July 2009","score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" The Long Good Friday is about a gangster named Harold Shand who has eliminated all rivals, hob knobs with a portion of London society, and has big visions about deals that will make London great again. However, just mistaking this as just a gangster film, and not about much more, is a huge mistake. On one level, Shand represents the state of England. Like England, he is tired of the Americans always having the upper hand. He is arrogant, brash, and at the same time tired of being put down and treated as second-class (like the United Kingdom at the time). He knows that there is the lure of an united Europe and the potential profits are tremendous. . On the next level of interpretation, the Irish issue always somehow shoves it's face into the picture. That is the iceberg that Shand has unwittingly hit. His loyal friend (Paul Freeman) from long ago (the Frenchman in Raiders Of The Lost Ark) has accidentally had a deal with some wing of the IRA in Belfast that cost him his life. The audience gasps at the word IRA, because now he has to confront a powerful and well organized rival. As one of Shand's associates says when Shand attempts to confront a group of IRA in London, They are political. These are fanatics!.On another level, the reality of the movie is that Shand's gang is slowly bumped off and his prized pub blown up, Shand slowly starts to find out what really is the cause of the vendetta against him. The movie is also a detective's mystery. Shand becomes Poirot for most of the movie - trying to figure out who really is out to get him. He is as clueless as the audience is. On the next level, this movie is called The Long Good Friday, because it is also a religiously symbolic movie. It takes place on religious holiday. It is about a man who thinks that he is righteous, accidentally kills perhaps his most loyal lieutenant, and then thinks he can cover it up and redeem himself by committing himself to focusing on revenge.

But this is no peaceful kid commune -- Isaac is a preacher for He Who Walks Behind the Rows, a vengeful god who wishes death to all adults and those who wrong him.Stephen King's stories tend to get developed into fairly lackluster films. I could name a few, but I won't. Children of the Corn is a notable exception, being one of the staples of 1980s horror, and spawning numerous sequels. Featuring Linda Hamilton (before playing Sarah Connor in Terminator), this is a noteworthy story of evil children, in the vein of Who Can Kill a Child? and Village of the Damned. For truly, if children are innocent, how can one fight back against a bloodthirsty mob of toddlers? This film succeeds on the grounds of being an interesting story, without the need of gore or sex. In fact, despite multiple murders, the camera more often than not pans away or we are not treated to the actual vision of death. One of the most disturbing images -- a crucified police officer -- is still fairly mild and may even have a sense of black humor for the fans.The actors should be noted for creating a quality film. Aside from Hamilton and her co-star Peter Horton (who has long since been forgotten), the children deserve credit for giving mature and compelling performances. Isaac is a strong preacher, and the ginger kid Malachi is threatening. Sure, one looks like a young Patton Oswalt and the other should star in Pete and Pete, but we can excuse that. Even the girl who plays Sarah should be heralded for her shy and reserved display.Fans of 1980s horror really should have this in their collection, and now thanks to Anchor Bay, they can acquire a high quality Blu-Ray version with never before seen special features.

I cannot say how much the video quality has been touched up -- you can only do so much with an older film -- but the sound is booming quite literally -- the living room shook and kept me awake even though I watched in the late hours of the night.

One day he helps aid a couple who are struggling with their raft down the river. It turns out to be a dubious gambler named Harry Weston and his saloon singer girlfriend, Kay, whom both Matt and Mark have already been acquainted with. Turns out that Harry is in a rush to register his mining claim that he has just won, and sensing his journey will be considerably quicker and safer on horseback, steals, after a fight, Matt's rifle and horse. Agreeing to let Kay stay behind with the Calder's, Weston sets off. Once roused and ready to travel, Matt, aware that an Indian attack on their remote home is imminent, sets off in pursuit of Weston with the other two in tow, down the treacherous river.River Of No Return, starring Robert Mitchum, Marilyn Monroe and directed by Otto Preminger. River Of No Return, the film neither of them gave a second thought too once the picture had wrapped. It was a much troubled production that saw Preminger and Monroe reach positive levels of hatred for each other, with Mitchum acting as go between for much of the time. Preminger was tackling his first film in the Western genre and clearly wanted to make it a mark of realism. A hard task master at the best of times, Preminger further distanced himself from his stars by demanding they do their own stunts, something that even the normally professional Mitchum found over the top. There's much more back story to the film, all of it creating a bad atmosphere on the shoot Preminger even walking off the film before completion, leaving Jean Negulesco to wrap it up, be it jealous husbands, nuisance coaches or peril from injury. All tid-bids available from various biographies or click-able internet resources. So the film, hated by the critics and makers alike, has to be a stinker then, surely?Well some what surprisingly, no it isn't half bad. For sure the plot is simple in the extreme, and it's far from being a truly memorable Western offering. But it's IMDb rating of 6.5 is probably just about right. There is still much to like here. It's a gorgeous looking film for a start, yep there is some shonky studio work blending in with the location shoot, but Preminger and his cinematographer Joseph LaShelle really bring the wilderness rush on to the screen. Shot at both Banff and Jasper National Parks in Alberta, Canada, it's at once as beautiful as it is imposing, with Mitchum's ruggedness and Monroe's sensuality expertly framed within the landscapes. Some of the scenes alongside the Athabasca and Bow rivers are worth the viewing time alone, with the impact enriched by great work from the sound department (Bernard Freericks & Roger Heman). This a film that shows the need for the right location choices to utilise the Technicolor and CinemaScope enhancements available at the time.The cast work well considering what little quality is in the script, tho Rory Calhoun as Harry Weston is underused because it's obvious that 20th Century Fox were trying to get maximum mileage from it's two leading stars. Mitchum, if truth be told, cake walks thru the movie. Not asked to do a great deal, it none the less works because Matt Calder is more about a beefcake presence than any thespian leanings. Something that Mitchum, in his laid back laconic way, was perfect for. It's a shame that Monroe, post release of the film, was so vehemently against it (calling it a Z grade Western at one point) because it's a sweet and affecting turn from her. In what could have been a stereotypical and typecast role as Kay, Monroe puts a bit of humanist thought into her, even coping well in the surrogate mother\/ big sister strand involving Tommy Rettig's (The Raid & The Last Wagon) young Mark. Monroe also gets to do four songs in the piece, I'm Gonna File My Claim, One Silver Dollar, Down in the Meadow and the delightful finale of The River of No Return (Marilyn radiant here).Not remotely close to being the best work by all involved, but as much as they all seemingly hated it, it has too much going for it to ever be considered bad.

This a film that shows the need for the right location choices to utilise the Technicolor and CinemaScope enhancements available at the time.The cast work well considering what little quality is in the script, tho Rory Calhoun as Harry Weston is underused because it's obvious that 20th Century Fox were trying to get maximum mileage from it's two leading stars. Mitchum, if truth be told, cake walks thru the movie. Not asked to do a great deal, it none the less works because Matt Calder is more about a beefcake presence than any thespian leanings. Something that Mitchum, in his laid back laconic way, was perfect for. It's a shame that Monroe, post release of the film, was so vehemently against it (calling it a Z grade Western at one point) because it's a sweet and affecting turn from her. In what could have been a stereotypical and typecast role as Kay, Monroe puts a bit of humanist thought into her, even coping well in the surrogate mother\/ big sister strand involving Tommy Rettig's (The Raid & The Last Wagon) young Mark. Monroe also gets to do four songs in the piece, I'm Gonna File My Claim, One Silver Dollar, Down in the Meadow and the delightful finale of The River of No Return (Marilyn radiant here).Not remotely close to being the best work by all involved, but as much as they all seemingly hated it, it has too much going for it to ever be considered bad. Yeah, 6.5\/10 sounds about right to me.

International intrigue, plots and counter-plots by the rival superpowers and their allies were as often the subject of 007's missions as the generic megalomaniacs with designs for world domination. Bond came from an era where morality was loose and accountability even looser when it came to the planning and execution of clandestine activities in the name of 'queen and country', where agents were freely permitted to kill and\/or destroy if it would further the 'cause'.It is therefore no surprise that with the end of the Cold War in the early 1990's, nearly four decades after 007 sprang to life on the printed page (and three decades before his even more grandiose debut on the big screen), questions regarding the characters relevance in the new era of relative peace in Europe and the wider world inevitably sprang up. Nevertheless, Barbara Brocolli resolved to end the speculations in 1995 by continuing the 'family business' and bringing the legendary spy back to life. And hence, Pierce Brosnan was chosen to play 'Ian Flemmings James Bond 007' in 'Goldeneye'.The film begins like any Cold War-era Bond adventure (indeed because it begins in the midst of the Cold War). Bond and his fellow agent, Alec Trevelyan, 006, infiltrate a Soviet weapons facility for the purpose of destroying it, their motive as always-'for England'. Unfortunately for them, the mission goes horribly wrong, when Alec is killed by Colonel Ouromov. Bond succeeds in destroying the base and barely escapes with his life. After a visually spectacular opening credits sequence (symbollically depicting the fall of the Soviet Union) the film flashes forward by nine years, to the post-Cold War world of the mid 1990's. James Bond's world has clearly changed drastically in many regards. MI6 has a new chief, the 'Evil Queen of Numbers' who has assumed the mantle of M, who clearly does not accord Bond the same level of professional respect her predecessor did, instead considering him as merely a 'sexist, misogynist, dinosaur...a relic of the Cold War' (a view many critics of Bond in the real world had been upholding at the time). As a consequence of the new regime, Bond's trained instincts after years of active field work are largely ignored by 'statistical analysis'. Miss Moneypenny is no longer the passive creature of bygone years but an actively assertive feminist. Bond's counterparts in the CIA sneer at his seemingly childish adherence to 'secret codes' and protocols. Russia is no longer the enemy, it is now an ally to some extent. And yet, the more things change, the more they stay the same. Bond still drives his Aston Martin, drinks vodka martinis 'shaken not stirred', relies on his trusty Walther PPK, and makes a pass at every 'next girl'. He still gathers elaborate gadgets from Q (and still misuses them!). And despite her initial disapproval of him, M still requires 007 to investigate and pursue the Janus crime syndicate. So Bond travels to St. Petersburg and Cuba, discovering a deadly satellite weapon, a conspiracy within the Russian government, an old friend turned foe and two women who are more than just eye candy; one is a psychopathic femme fatale named Xenia Onatopp; the other is a skilled computer programmer named Natalya Simyonova. As always, Bond saves the day by thwarting the villains plans, but there is an added depth to the character hitherto unseen in any Bond film. We learn that Bond is not merely a hired gun for Her Majesty, he is his own man with his own feelings and motivations. And we also learn that while the Cold War may have ended, Bond is yet to completely step out of the cold, after a lifetime of treachery, violence and death. Nevertheless, by the end of the film, we can assume that Bond has at least left some of his demons behind and is prepared to embrace the new world where his services are still required...Pierce Brosnan does a fabulous job as James Bond. His Bond is a perfect blend between the rough and ruthless portrayal of Timothy Dalton and the comparatively smoother and sophisticated portrayal of Sean Connery. Bond's 'boyish charms' conceal the coldness of a professional killer, an aspect which Brosnan masterfully portrays. Sean Bean does a great job as Alec Trevelyan, a darker version of Bond who HAS embraced the new world in order to destroy it. Judi Dench does well in the first of many appearances as M, a portrayal which would go on to evolve and live on beyond Brosnan's tenure in the tuxedo. Famke Jacksen stuns the audiences with her role as the psychopathic femme fatale Xenia, while Izabella Scorpusco does okay as the ever-efficient cool as nerves Natalya.All in all, Goldeneye is in many ways the rebirth of James Bond in the post-Cold War world, much as Casino Royale went on to become the rebirth of Bond in the post 9\/11 world.

Sam Neil is fantastic, completely embroiled in the character, rivaling Kinski at times. The color palette is extremely original as well using an odd combination of blues, oranges and yellows. Almost every scene is memorable and thrilling to behold. What many people don't mention is the remarkable humor of the film. At points it is incredibly, darkly funny. Not to mention it's genre-shifting plot structure. To some the film will be hard to swallow because of its experimental narrative. So don't expect your aunt Clara to get it. But to anyone with good taste in film it is an obscure masterpiece to be held, cherished, and worshiped. There is only one big problem. The film is basically out of print. There could be a few VHS editions floating around. The only DVD copy you can get was on a Horror Double Feature disc paired with a Fulci film. But that just went out of print as well (I snatched up the last copy at the closing of Kim's Video). If any film needs a restored DVD release on Criterion, or an upload to NetFlix and Itunes it's this one. And Valerie and her Week of Wonders. NetFlix has the film, but it's still listed as save status. This does give me a little hope though. C'mon distributors and archivists. Save Possession!

On one level it's a standard revenge Western, with Stewart looking for the gunrunners who caused his brother's death, but his hunt takes in rancher Donald Crisp's powerful but dysfunctional dynasty and its divisions as well, and its through them that the film moves into almost mythically tragic territory. With foreman and almost adopted son Arthur Kennedy devotedly but thanklessly running the ranch for him and constantly trying to protect the old man from the feckless stupidity and sadism of his natural son Alex Nicol it soon becomes clear that not all the bad guys are that bad. Indeed, everything Kennedy does wrong is done out of the best motives that are constantly thwarted, turning what could easily have been a stereotypical villain into a genuinely tragic figure as he realises the man he regards as a second father sees him only as a mere employee (interestingly, James Gray used this same character arc for Joaquin Phoenix's character in The Yards). Even Crisp's autocrat is tormented by recurring dreams of a stranger riding in to destroy his family as he slowly goes blind, believing Stewart to be a virtual horseman of the apocalypse.Along with the tormented and frustrated characters it's also surprisingly violent for its day. While it wasn't unusual for Stewart's characters to carry their own stigmata in Mann's Westerns (in Bend of the River he even hides a scar on his neck from a botched lynching), here he really suffers as he's beaten up, dragged across salt flats and through a fire and then shot in the hand in one scene alone, all of which only serves to fuel his hatred more until the affable character we met at the film's beginning has become a distant memory. In many ways it reverses the usual journey Mann put Stewart through in their Westerns rather than going from bitterness to reluctant hero, here he starts out 'nice to everybody' (as the very out-of-keeping title song puts it) to end the film all but consumed by rage.As usual, there's admirable economy in the writing - there's a lot of plot and several key characters but it manages bring them all over and incorporate an almost mystical sense of tragic destiny without seeming rushed or contrived, offering a satisfying Western with some substance. . It's also the closest Mann ever got to his long cherished Western version of King Lear that he was finally preparing when he died during the shooting of A Dandy in Aspic. The only one of the Mann-Stewart films together to be shot in Scope, Mann uses it superbly, and not just in the mountain location shots. Check out the beautiful establishing shot of the town on Sunday evening, the Mexicans and Indians heading for church on one side of the frame while on the other the white townsfolk drink and gamble. Thankfully that's preserved in Columbia's widescreen DVD, though the only extra is a clumsily cropped trailer introduced by Stewart on the film's set.

Several other classic horror films are also referenced including the Exorcist, Friday the 13th, Halloween 1 and 2, Hellraiser, Prom Night, The Howling and Rosemary's Baby.The plot revolves around Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), a young high Schooler who's mother was viciously murdered a year or so earlier. Sidney was convinced her mother's murderer was Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) who was convicted of the crime and is in now in jail. Tabloid news reporter Gail Weathers however, has her doubts and has printed a series of articles and a tell all novel pleading Weary's innocence. Her theory is given credence as a series of copycat killings, modeled after 80s horror movies, occur. Sidney soon finds herself living in a real life scary movie with no allies and everyone's a suspect.I find it a bit hard to rate Scream as a slasher film, as I don't see it as one.

Minority Report obviously had a lot of effort put into it by both the filmmakers and its actors and the result is a brilliant thriller. In the past decade I would call it Spielberg's best, ranking among his other great thrillers, 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', and 'Jaws'.The movies is based on a short story by the late sci-fi master Philip K. Dick (Blade Runner, Total Recall, A Scanner Darkly) and it ranks up with Blade Runner as the greatest adaptations of his work. John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is the Chief of the Pre-Crime division in the District of Columbia. What exactly is his job? To use the unusual psychic abilities of three beings &#x96; known as Pre-Cogs- it is his job to analyze future crime scenes and prevent murder from happening. For ten years this system works without a flaw and they are close to taking the program national, only there's one problem&#x85;John's name has been called for the future-murder of Leo Crow &#x96;a man he has never once before met. On the run Anderton must evade the highly controlled security of the future United States capital all while trying to prove his innocence, and in so doing unraveling the secrets of the system- secrets that would destroy everything the organization has worked so hard to achieve.What really makes this movie stand out is not the visual effects (though, they certainly are amazing), but it is the human aspect of this film that makes it a memorable experience for the audience. The film manages to cater to all human emotions contained within the plot, from the fear of loss, obsession, greed, fear, insecurity, and many more. All the characters are found to be believable, as none of them come across as being cardboard, as so many other action films do.Tom Cruise pulls a very believable performance and I consider this one of the best of his Average Joe performances. By this I mean like in 'War of the Worlds' he doesn't come across as being a superhero, as he was in the 'Mission Impossible' franchise. He is perfectly believable as a sad soul who only wishes to make up for his past mistakes and punish the criminals of the world. Haunted by tragedy of the past we can't help but sympathize for his loss, because we can believe him. This isn't a straight-forward tragic character, such as Kurt Russell's Colonel O'Neil in 'Stargate' (1994). John Anderton is suffering, but he hides it well, going on with his job. In fact his loss is his drive in his work, so naturally he can't believe it when the system turns against him. It's the compelling characters and performances from the actors that make the difference between a good movie and a great movie. Special effects have nothing to do with the quality of the human element of the story (sorry, Michael Bay).The special effects of this film are amazing, providing a believable, yet still fascinating view of the future. Unlike visions presented in Blade Runner, and to a certain degree Total Recall, this is a very clean, well kept design for the future. All the buildings shine and all vehicles appear to be in tip-top condition, but like those other Dick based films the underlying structure of society is as corrupt as ever. How the effect crew for this film was skipped over by the Academy I will never understand, because even two years after I first saw the film many of the visuals remain stuck in my mind.You should not miss Minority Report, because in my opinion it is one of the best films ever made, let alone one of the best science fiction films ever made. For a thrilling, emotional, and mentally stimulating movie experience I can't recommend Minority Report strongly enough to give the film credit, for it goes above and beyond what so many other films have done. So, if you want excitement and brain stimulating ideas forget the garbage of the current theater's films, such as Transformers, and do yourself a favor forget that an action movie is not supposed to be dominated by pure special effects and action, go out, buy a copy of Minority Report, put it in your DVD player, sit down, and enjoy a non-stop thrill ride of a movie.

All the buildings shine and all vehicles appear to be in tip-top condition, but like those other Dick based films the underlying structure of society is as corrupt as ever. How the effect crew for this film was skipped over by the Academy I will never understand, because even two years after I first saw the film many of the visuals remain stuck in my mind.You should not miss Minority Report, because in my opinion it is one of the best films ever made, let alone one of the best science fiction films ever made. For a thrilling, emotional, and mentally stimulating movie experience I can't recommend Minority Report strongly enough to give the film credit, for it goes above and beyond what so many other films have done. So, if you want excitement and brain stimulating ideas forget the garbage of the current theater's films, such as Transformers, and do yourself a favor forget that an action movie is not supposed to be dominated by pure special effects and action, go out, buy a copy of Minority Report, put it in your DVD player, sit down, and enjoy a non-stop thrill ride of a movie.

Minority Report obviously had a lot of effort put into it by both the filmmakers and its actors and the result is a brilliant thriller. In the past decade I would call it Spielberg's best, ranking among his other great thrillers, 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', and 'Jaws'.The movies is based on a short story by the late sci-fi master Philip K. Dick (Blade Runner, Total Recall, A Scanner Darkly) and it ranks up with Blade Runner as the greatest adaptations of his work. John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is the Chief of the Pre-Crime division in the District of Columbia. What exactly is his job? To use the unusual psychic abilities of three beings &#x96; known as Pre-Cogs- it is his job to analyze future crime scenes and prevent murder from happening. For ten years this system works without a flaw and they are close to taking the program national, only there's one problem&#x85;John's name has been called for the future-murder of Leo Crow &#x96;a man he has never once before met. On the run Anderton must evade the highly controlled security of the future United States capital all while trying to prove his innocence, and in so doing unraveling the secrets of the system- secrets that would destroy everything the organization has worked so hard to achieve.What really makes this movie stand out is not the visual effects (though, they certainly are amazing), but it is the human aspect of this film that makes it a memorable experience for the audience. The film manages to cater to all human emotions contained within the plot, from the fear of loss, obsession, greed, fear, insecurity, and many more. All the characters are found to be believable, as none of them come across as being cardboard, as so many other action films do.Tom Cruise pulls a very believable performance and I consider this one of the best of his Average Joe performances. By this I mean like in 'War of the Worlds' he doesn't come across as being a superhero, as he was in the 'Mission Impossible' franchise. He is perfectly believable as a sad soul who only wishes to make up for his past mistakes and punish the criminals of the world. Haunted by tragedy of the past we can't help but sympathize for his loss, because we can believe him. This isn't a straight-forward tragic character, such as Kurt Russell's Colonel O'Neil in 'Stargate' (1994). John Anderton is suffering, but he hides it well, going on with his job. In fact his loss is his drive in his work, so naturally he can't believe it when the system turns against him. It's the compelling characters and performances from the actors that make the difference between a good movie and a great movie.
