It has a simple script and dull 'normal' characters. However due to the way the story is written en acted out by its actors, the movie becomes an absolute masterpiece and the power of the movie is in its 'normal' every day characters who are all in one way or another quite idiotic. The movie however doesn't force anything and all of the characters in the movie are portrayed as normal every day persons. Yes, all of the characters have their shortages but in a way, haven't we all? It makes the characters extremely realistic and it makes their actions all somewhat understandable, so we can easily relate to all of them.Even though the story itself might be quite simple, it's still an enjoyable and well written one. It has some good turns and unexpected events. But it really is the subtlety of the story that makes it truly so brilliant. Nothing in the movie feels forced or over-the-top, despite the fact that the events in the movie come across as idiotic and unlikely in some cases.It's not a comedy that really tries to be funny. It's more of a dark-comedy that through its subtle made sequences becomes really funny at times. I mean the kidnap sequence has got to be one of the most subtlety comical sequences ever made, when the kidnappers walk up on the porch, peek through the window but don't see anybody sitting while the victim, who is watching a lame TV-show, on the other hand clearly can. Or when the foot with a white sock is still sticking out of the wood chipper. Or the moment when father and son have a serious talk and afterward when the father closes the door, a poster of the accordion king is shown. It's extremely dry made and it are subtlety directed and acted sequences like these that make Fargo such a great piece of comedy and without doubt one of the best movies of the '90's, if not of all time. Every moment in the movie is build up extremely well and even though the movie is slow, it never becomes dull because of the great build up. The biggest joke of the movie is the fact, that despite the claim on the beginning of the movie, this movie is not based on a true story at all. I don't know why but I find this an absolutely brilliant touch from the Coen brothers. Like I said before, all of the characters are in one way or another quite idiotic and losers and they all have their certain shortages, which makes them all very humane and easy to relate with at the same time. The characters certainly are one of the reasons why this movie is so incredibly enjoyable to watch. The accents are crazy and all of the characters are perfectly portrayed by its actors. Frances McDormand even received an Oscar for her role. The movie itself was nominated for a total of 7 Oscars, including Best Picture but it only took home 2, for McDormand and the script written by the Coen brothers. Other notable great actors in the movie are Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare as the almost amateur like kidnappers, William H. Macy as the weak person who hired them to kidnap his wife and Harve Presnell as the tough father-in-law.The depressing and boring white background of the town of Fargo and its environment works perfect for the slow and odd story. It even makes the characters somewhat more understandable. I mean, can you just imaging a normal person living in Fargo? The cinematography by Roger Deakins and the musical score by Carter Burwell all add to this fantastic movie atmosphere of Fargo.Wonderful directed, build up and timed, with great performances from all its actors. One of the most original and brilliant (dark)comedies ever created.

Apparently the character of Zoolander was one that Stiller has given quite a lot of thought and has spent some time developing. I can't see how you could possibly spend time on a character as flat as Zoolander, however, because the character is only funny for about half an hour and then he just becomes annoying.Much of the comedy in the film is based on how stupid the male models are and while it is funny watching Stiller pose and making an ass of himself it grows thin quite quickly (I did find his three identical facial poses extremely funny). Stiller fills out the character and you can see that the character is important to him but the character was in my opinion probably better off as a sketch-character and not a character that would warrant an entire movie because he simply isn't interesting enough. Owen Wilson does a mediocre job at best and his character comes alive only in the scenes with Stiller because of their chemistry. Christine Taylor is in my opinion probably a below average actress and her performance in this film in particular is pretty stiff to say the least. She has no real presence. Milla Jovovich has a quite funny role in the film but unfortunately she is critically underused. Will Ferrel and Jerry Stiller are both decent and both of them never really become memorable. Jerry Stiller does his best but his character is just too limited.The trailer looked relatively funny but the actual film lacked spirit resulting in a very uneven comedy. There are a few funny scenes and only about one scene where I laughed hard and that was just not enough as I had expected more from it. The film also has another problem. Its too repetitive.

You have to be in the mood for something that is stupid and at times lame but if you can settle with that you should give it a try.

I, myself, did not enjoy the film particularly but I was probably also in the wrong mood for it and as always watching a film is a highly subjective matter.4\/10 ","genre":"Comedy"},{"date":"26 April 2006","score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" I have to say I'm surprised, this movie started out great, it had a flashy attention grabbing beginning that really draws you in, but halfway through the movie I was wondering when it was going to end.

The beginning had shock value and mystery but after that the movie turns an entirely different direction. The movie was really about human emotion, tragedy, hardship and moving on. The movie is about people and their relationships and how they are all connected in some way. Each person has an effect on the lives of the people around them.

It is an emotionally heavy film and three hours of the same emotional extremes and messages can get very tedious. Another flaw in the film was how the style changed.

We're meant to feel terrible that an innocent woman plunges to her horrible death. But how can we experience the horror when Frank, a helicopter pilot played by Ralph Waite out of The Waltons, is in the background cackling with laughter. Just watch him. His eyes sparkle when Stallone tells the woman that she's not doing to die and he collapses in near hysterics when she falls. Contrast this with Michael Rooker's overacting &#150; he almost faints when the girl plummets, while Frank is hooting in the background &#150; and you have a scene that is nowhere near as powerful as it should be.But to be fair to Stallone and the girl, they do a pretty good job. The girl pleads and pleads, and Stallone gamely hangs on. And the situation itself is excellent &#150; huge drop; cracked harness; burly, lazy-mouthed actor trying to hang on to hysterical woman. But whenever I watch the scene I can only see Frank's huge grin, his glowing eyes and a shocked reaction that looks more like him doubling over in laughter.However, laughter is a common reaction in Cliffhanger. Well, for me at least. But that's not to say I dislike the film. It's a very enjoyable action movie. But it can't transcend the clichés of the genre. Instead it buries its face in them and thrashes about like mad for over an hour and a half.One of the clichés the film adheres to is that the villain must be English. Well, at least I think he is. John Lithgow puts on an accent of some sort. But it's an amusing performance. His best bit has to be when he gets Stallone to climb up a rock face to get his money. You, stay. You, fetch. The joy is in his exaggerated enunciation. Another funny bit is when Stallone throws Lithgow's money into the helicopter's rotors. Damn you, Walker! he screams like he's split a fingernail.But there are other English villains. The first is Caroline Goodall who comes across in the film as sort of a low-rent Emma Thompson. But much more amusing is Craig Fairbrass (Dan out of EastEnders). His performance is atrocious. All he does is shout and swear. And he does it in a thick Cockney accent. But he's immortalised in the scene where Michael Rooker goads him into beating him up rather than killing him straight away &#150; the Cockney is about as bright as a puddle of oil. It turns out that Fairbrass' character is an ex-footballer. And I guess that shouldn't be too surprising when his dialogue consists of lines like Yeah? And you're a loudmouth punk slag who's about to die. The only people I know who talk like that are West Ham fans. But Fairbrass proceeds to give Rooker a surreal football-themed beating &#150; he even runs up to take a penalty. Is this how Hollywood sees the English? We're either effete brigands or beer-swilling hooligans. Actually, thinking about it, it's quite an accurate observation.But my favourite villain is played by Leon (he's so cool he doesn't even have a surname). He eschews Fairbrass' shouty brand of villainy and tries to be quietly intimidating. But his line delivery is so bad that he's about as scary as a moustachioed villain twiddling his exaggerated face fur. However, it's notable that unlike Fairbrass he actually does excel once he gives into his urge to shout. He has a great scene in a cave where he actually seems like a genuine threat &#150; he stalks Stallone and his girl with menace. But then Stallone grabs him by the balls and presses him through a spike. It's a WWE sort of death&#133;which I dig a great deal.But what about Stallone? How does he fair in the film? Well, I've never really had much of a problem with him. Yeah he's not a terribly good actor and yes he sounds like man who was born with an upside down brain, but that's part of the joy of watching him act. Just take the scenes after the accident at the start. His idea of being haunted is to mope about like a thirteen year old that's been told to stop using his father's credit card to download porn. It's so amateurish. And I love the way that the villains, when making him climb the mountain, order him to remove his jacket. I can't help but feel that this wasn't done to prove how evil the villains are, but to allow Sly to climb while flaunting his thick, muscular arms. We don't want those babies covered up.However, Stallone looks like Marlon Brando compared to the Whoa, dude! extreme sports enthusiasts. They're sort of like Bill and Ted but without the charm. In fact, I wasn't distraught that one of them died; I was distraught that one survived. But at least the death of the one who looks like Kurt Cobain gives us a hilarious silent No! moment from Michael Rooker. But then later on we get to relive the hilarity, because Frank's death elicits another's rib-tickling No! moment. Hey, what can I say, the old bastard had it coming. You ain't laughing now, are you?

This success took him to direct the ambitious adaptation of Batman in 1989 and gave him enough freedom to develop his own personal projects. The first of them was this little film. Edward Scissorhands, a charming fable about a misunderstood young man, is probably the first film where Burton expresses his personal views on the world and at the same time, expands his vivid visual style to new heights.The story begins with Peg (Dianne Wiest), an Avon door-to-door seller who discovers Edward (Johnny Depp) living lonely in the haunting mansion that rises above the little suburban town where she lives. Surprised at the fact that Edward seems to have scissors instead of hands, she takes him home in order to help him to adapt to the community. While at first he is accepted, he'll discover that human relations are more complex than he imagined; and things will complicate even more when he falls in love with Peg's daughter Kim (Winona Ryder).Burton creates a modern fairy tale that is not only visually impressive, but also very entertaining and most of all, very meaningful. Edward is a man who is just experiencing life, but due to his handicap he can't fully fit in Peg's apparently perfect world. His love for Kim also creates problems when Kim's boyfriend Jim (Anthony Michael Hall) makes Edward's life even harder. Edward is an outcast whose inability to touch gets in conflict with his desire to love, while at the same time faces the suburban community which seems more frightening than the haunting Gothic castle where he was living before.Johnny Depp changed his image of teenage heartthrob and with this film he began to show his great potential and superb talent to literally become one with his character. He portrays the emotions of the confused Edward with feeling and power, and gives life to Edward's mix of fragility and naiveté. Winona Ryder also was a rising star at that moment, and while her character is nowhere as complex as Depp's, she plays the role of Kim with dignity and grace. In this movie she displays the talent that would convert her into one of the most promising young actresses of her generation.Burton imagination has no limits and his eye for visuals excels in Edward Scissorhands. His care for detail creates haunting images and beautiful compositions; from the haunting castle where Edward lives, to the grass sculpture that he creates, everything fits in this bizarre fairy tale and complete the perfection of this movie.It is hard to find a flaw in the film, as it is probably the first masterpiece that Tim Burton would create in his career. While of course it has some logical plot holes, as a whole the film is one of the best movies ever done in history, as it successfully mixes fantasy, drama and romance with a small dose of Burton's black humor. Depp and Burton would continue working together in many films, including Burton's masterpiece Ed Wood.With the exception of Ed Wood, Tim Burton has never been this good. Edward Scissorhands definitely has earned its classic status on its own right, as it is one of those movies that touch the deep parts of the soul with its inventive originality and almost-magical charm. Edward Scissorhands is simply unforgettable. 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"26 April 2006","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Tim Burton was a rising star in film-making when in 1988 he released his successful mix of dark comedy and horror Beetlejuice.

Edward is an outcast whose inability to touch gets in conflict with his desire to love, while at the same time faces the suburban community which seems more frightening than the haunting Gothic castle where he was living before.Johnny Depp changed his image of teenage heartthrob and with this film he began to show his great potential and superb talent to literally become one with his character. He portrays the emotions of the confused Edward with feeling and power, and gives life to Edward's mix of fragility and naiveté. Winona Ryder also was a rising star at that moment, and while her character is nowhere as complex as Depp's, she plays the role of Kim with dignity and grace. In this movie she displays the talent that would convert her into one of the most promising young actresses of her generation.Burton imagination has no limits and his eye for visuals excels in Edward Scissorhands. His care for detail creates haunting images and beautiful compositions; from the haunting castle where Edward lives, to the grass sculpture that he creates, everything fits in this bizarre fairy tale and complete the perfection of this movie.It is hard to find a flaw in the film, as it is probably the first masterpiece that Tim Burton would create in his career. While of course it has some logical plot holes, as a whole the film is one of the best movies ever done in history, as it successfully mixes fantasy, drama and romance with a small dose of Burton's black humor. Depp and Burton would continue working together in many films, including Burton's masterpiece Ed Wood.With the exception of Ed Wood, Tim Burton has never been this good. Edward Scissorhands definitely has earned its classic status on its own right, as it is one of those movies that touch the deep parts of the soul with its inventive originality and almost-magical charm. Edward Scissorhands is simply unforgettable. 10\/10 ","genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"},{"date":"26 April 2006","score":"","review":" This is a fine film with a terrific cast. Its Spartan set serves to draw the viewer into the intensity that churns throughout the deliberations of the twelve men constitute the jury in a criminal case. It is hard to imagine a simpler story line the twelve person jury has retired to deliberate the fate of a young man charged with murdering his father. One of the number (Henry Fonda) votes not guilty in the first vote. The other 11 jurors, more or less convinced that they are discussing an open and shut case, immediately set out to prove him wrong. Instead, one expresses doubts about the evidence and proceeds to convince the other jurors, one by one, of the flaws in the evidence and the existence of a reasonable doubt as to the guilt. Nearly all of the action takes place in the jury room, or in the restroom adjacent to it. There is no recreation of the crime other than those portions of the evidence acted out by the jurors in the course of their deliberations. This film does not emphasize the police work, or the work of the lawyers in the trial, or of investigators, or forensic evidence. Instead, the viewer is drawn into the drama of twelve jurors trying to decide what is the right thing to do in the case. Each in turn reveals a bias or flaw in his logic that has caused him to view the evidence in a particular way. In the end, each is confronted to identify his blind spot and acknowledge that it is that blind spot that caused him to think the defendant guilty rather than a careful examination of the evidence. One just wants to get to the Yankees game, one believes if an immigrant is charged with a crime he has to be guilty, and so forth. There are two dramatic moments that stand out above the rest. The first is the speech by Ed Begley in which he reveals that his determination of guilt is based on nothing other than blind prejudice. During his speech, the jurors leave the table and turn their backs on Begley, who in the end acknowledges his bias. The second is when the final holdout juror, Lee J. Cobb, comes to grips with the fact that he hopes to punish the defendant as a means of vicariously punishing his own son, who has apparently rejected Cobb. Of course each of those instances are high melodrama -- would that racial or ethnic prejudice was as easily identified and eliminated as it was in the film -- but each is played out with sufficient intensity as not to seem hokey or contrived. The film does show its age in a couple of respects -- there are no women on this jury, and no people of color -- an all white male jury in late 1950's New York is pretty unlikely. Nonetheless, this is a superb film with tremendous performances by the ensemble cast. On another level, Twelve Angry Men betrays a kind of pre-Vietnam, pre-JFK assassination innocence about the ability of American ideals to triumph over all sorts of biases if only people are made to confront those biases. That idea is of course harder to sustain post-Vietnam, post-JFK murder, post-Watergate, but it is worthy of noting that not too long ago, it was still believed that such a triumph of ideals was possible. In the polarized nation we live in now, where the more obvious people's biases become, the more tenaciously they cling to them, the underlying message of Twelve Angry Men just might be one we need to hear.

This movie reflects the big-screen, brightly colored and chock full of designer clothing look that was typical of the 60s.

Many of the reviewers seemed unnecessarily troubled by the lack of explanations in the plot. That ambiguity, of course, was part of the plot. Why did the birds suddenly organize and attack? We don't know. Not knowing why the threat exists is part of the terror. We take for granted that birds are just a non-threatening part of the scenery in our lives. What, says Hitchcock, would happen if birds, especially birds not particularly known as hunters like gulls and crows and ordinary starlings, suddenly and inexplicably appeared to start to prey on human beings. The birds are eco-terrorists, if you will. Clearly humanity has done something to ruffle the birds' tail-feathers. Caging them, as with the lovebirds, is perhaps the cause. Perhaps the cause is pesticide use or pollution. Whatever the cause, the birds are mad as hell and not going to take it any more. What that idea amounts to is a pretty good story line for for an installment of the Alfred Hitchcock Hour, but not quite enough meat for a feature film. Add to that some mediocre acting by Rod Taylor and Tippi Hedren in the lead roles (there was no chemistry between them whatsoever) and you have the recipe for a disappointing effort from Hitchcock. While I will admit that this movie scared the bejesus out of me when I first saw it on TV at age 8, it's really not all that frightening. It is ironic that in a film where birds are portrayed as apparently up in arms over their mistreatment by humans, in at least some scenes, Hitchcok had stage hands physically throwing live birds at Tippi Hedren to enhance the bird attack sequences. Overall, though, the bird attacks come off as pretty hokey. The general chaos scenes are pretty good, but the close ups are so obviously mechanical birds as to be laughable. I absolutely hate the sequence of shots where Hedren tracks the flow of the gas from the gas station to the man lighting his cigar -- the facial reactions are just a little too much, especially since all she's doing is watching the flow. This film is okay as a light diversion, but if you seek out the Hitchcock Hour on DVD, you will find many episodes that are more worthwhile than this mediocre movie.

What that idea amounts to is a pretty good story line for for an installment of the Alfred Hitchcock Hour, but not quite enough meat for a feature film. Add to that some mediocre acting by Rod Taylor and Tippi Hedren in the lead roles (there was no chemistry between them whatsoever) and you have the recipe for a disappointing effort from Hitchcock. While I will admit that this movie scared the bejesus out of me when I first saw it on TV at age 8, it's really not all that frightening. It is ironic that in a film where birds are portrayed as apparently up in arms over their mistreatment by humans, in at least some scenes, Hitchcok had stage hands physically throwing live birds at Tippi Hedren to enhance the bird attack sequences. Overall, though, the bird attacks come off as pretty hokey. The general chaos scenes are pretty good, but the close ups are so obviously mechanical birds as to be laughable. I absolutely hate the sequence of shots where Hedren tracks the flow of the gas from the gas station to the man lighting his cigar -- the facial reactions are just a little too much, especially since all she's doing is watching the flow. This film is okay as a light diversion, but if you seek out the Hitchcock Hour on DVD, you will find many episodes that are more worthwhile than this mediocre movie.

This film has some humour, but there is more of a story\/drama in this film as opposed to the first. This film is weaker than the first one, and the characters seem to act differently from the original film. It is not quite as good, but it does have its moments and some pretty good action sequences.

Audrey Hepburn is not at her best her here, and in some stages of the film is quite unconvincing, but I suppose it's her character's notoriety that pulls it off. The quirky kook that is call-girl Holly is an intriguing, glamorous character who, despite her many flaws, is ultimately endearing to the audience.This is a frothy, lightweight but enjoyable film. Hepburn's early winsomeness as seen in the delightful 'Roman Holiday' (for which she won her sole Academy Award)was replaced later in her film career by a more 'practised' charm. Hepburn was acutely aware of the unique 'Hepburn magic' audiences expected to see when viewing her films, so it's little wonder that Holly's quirks and whims seem more like straight 'acting' than simply 'being'. Still, audiences love her in the role. Perhaps it's because of the fashions. One of the most recognisable images in cinema today is Hepburn's all-black wearing Holly with sunglasses and elegant gloves. She also proves that she can look good in ANYTHING, including a white sheet! As Holly's love interest Paul 'Fred' Varjak, George Peppard is adequate and reasonably good-looking (nice blue eyes!). Still, he's no great acting talent and Hepburn outshines him in every scene. Mickey Rooney has a ridiculous role as Holly's landlord, Mr Yunioshi. It's well-intended humour, but I just cringe every time he is on screen. Patricia Neal, ever the consummate performer, is good in a supporting role.Holly provides an interesting character study. She believes she belongs to no-one (including her beloved 'Cat'), but instead of butting societal conventions she conforms to them. She is a woman with that old-fashioned view that a rich husband is better than no husband at all, and she fools herself into believing that she will be happy with any one of the slimy, old millionaires on offer. The man who truly loves her (Paul) is right in front of her, but she is too blinded by her ideal to allow herself to fall in love with him. She comes off across quite shallow and stupid sometimes (to me, at least), so I wouldn't call her a good role model for young girls.If you want to see Audrey at her most naturally charming, see 'Sabrina' or 'Roman Holiday'. However, this is a fun, feel-good film definitely worth a look.8\/10.
