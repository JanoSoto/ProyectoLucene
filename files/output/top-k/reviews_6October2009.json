An adaptation of Hunter S. Thompson's unfilmable semi-autobiographical account of early 1970s drug culture, the film is basically a two-hour narcotics trip, ducking in and out of reality and surreal drug-addled fantasy without warning or explanation. Gilliam's direction is actually quite magnificent, every frame bursting with distorted colours and emotions, but his efforts are wasted on a story than meanders with perplexing aimlessness. The main character, Raoul Duke &#x96; a doppelganger for the novel's author &#x96; often launches into bizarre, pseudo-philosophical monologues on the crumbling state of American counter-culture, but these ultimately come across as little more than smoke and mirrors, the ramblings of a man so hopelessly addled by God-knows-how-many drugs that, to him, everything sounds profound. The best way to look at this film, I suppose, is as a very black comedy, and, indeed, the antics of Duke (Johnny Depp) and his possibly-Samoan attorney (Benicio Del Toro) are occasionally quite amusing.After being assigned to cover a motorcycle race in Nevada, journalist Raoul Duke and his lawyer Dr Gonzo strike off for the bright lights of Las Vegas. In a suitcase, they carry every illicit narcotic known to Mankind since the 16th century, and they aren't content to simple look at them. Is there a point to this film? No &#x96; or, at least, none that I could spy. Then again, the life of a drug addict is itself rather pointless. Gilliam strings together an assortment of vibrant, extravagant, and sometimes nightmarish, set-pieces. The camera distorts reality, tilting from side to side as though wielded by a drunken Robert Krasker; in this way, even the viewers' perception is tainted by the characters' drug use. However, while I did have an occasional chuckle thanks to Johnny Depp, whose performance is superbly eccentric, I didn't feel as though I was enjoying myself. I felt filthy, violated, and it's not a experience I'd care to repeat. Maybe, in order to appreciate this film, one must have used drugs or lived through the 1960s. I haven't done either, and I consider myself all the better for it.

They can't be a single soul had not seen this movie. By far it became a classic and received cult status and was given many academy awards at the Oscars. Quentin Tarantino became a popular director and the youth were inspired from his movies. However with this movie in particular he caught everyone's attention. Many movies later became inspired from this. Doug Liman's GO and SEVEN DAYS IN THE VALEEY were speculated with pulp fiction style. Hence why many directors were influenced by this movie and attempted to copy its style. Guy Rithie was very inspired by this movie. This was very evident in 'SNATCH'. This movie was a lot like a homage to the gangster genre. Influances of french and Asian cinema are clearly seem in the visuals. It also contained many moments that leads the viewer to watch on in anticipation as to what will happen next. It is an intriguing adventure none the less. This is the genre that I had wished Tarantino had stayed with. 'Reservoir dogs' and 'Jackie brown' were also were also some of his finest works. However his association with Robert Rodriguez led him on to the path of making vampire and zombie movies, which was not really to my taste. Im sure most of his fans may have adored them.**************************CONTAINS SPOILERS*********************** Many of Tarantino's movies have been shot in LA. So there has been no better way to portray the underworld realistically. We are given an insight in to a group of characters, some which are directly and indirectly related to the crime world. The movie is more like a collection of 6 stories collaborated in to one movie. One segment moves to the next. They have a linear pattern but they are shown in a non chronological order. Two hit men 'jackson and travolta' recover a suitcase and kill a boy accidentally in their car. They require quick assistance to to deal with the situation. Later on they go to a diner where the place will be robbed by a couple. We are then introduced to a black gangster's white wife that one of the hit men has to spend an evening with. He saves her life from a drug overdose. Afterwards a boxer turns his back on the gangster he had taken payment from but enters in to a situation whereby he is forgiven. These stories all sum up a 2 day period in LA. *************END OF Spoilers******************************* Upon viewing the movie one will notice that there is not really a plot to bite on. Instead we are witnesses to a number of situations that arise in coincidently and how the characters will pull themselves out of it. We are shown how members of the underworld operate and that they are very organised people. The movie is filled with witty dialogues and scenes of a violent nature. However I have seen korean movies that have depicted more. The movie is high on style and substance but is very character driven. I know LA is a very frightening city to live in and even innocent people can be hurt in gang wars. The movie clearly shows this. A lot of concentration and patience is require in some of scenes, diner scenes especially. Due to the fact they are very conversational. Many scenes are long stretched whereby a little editing would of helped the film. There is no background music in the movie at all. Tarantino instead incorporated music tracks in to many of the scenes to add to the atmosphere. It did not take away any quality what so ever surprisingly. A good example of this was when Butch was going to his apartment. Bruce Willis, Harvey Keitel, and Samuel L Jackson without a doubt give one of their best performances. However I could not understand what led Rosanna Arquette to do this role. I felt she was wasted.All is said this can surely be an exciting and enjoyable ride for anyone who understands and is a fan of gangster movies. It is nearly on line with 'the godfather'.

I mention this since the Guns of Navarone is not quite pro-war, but not anti-war as Gregory Peck thought it should be seen. It shows how people in an intense war-time engagement like the men on the mission in this film will have to do just about anything - even if it means the usual hero gets just close enough to the edge of being something else entirely (not quite, but you'll see the scene I'm talking about) - in order to carry out the end goal. It also shows what kind of man it might take to give up information easily to the enemy (or maybe not, as case turns out). And certainly watching your best buddies die is never something too satisfying. Hell, maybe the whole scope of the mission and its consequences are meant to teach a valuable lesson. Points taken... Then again, why is The Guns of Navarone so entertaining and invigorating that men from ages 5 to 95 want turn out and kick some ass after watching it? Well, it's probably because it falls into the camp of flicks like The Dirty Dozen and Kelly's Heroes (if not quite as funny) as a movie about Guys-on-a-Mission. In this case the mission is simple get behind enemy lines on the little island of Navarone, where damn giant guns (or rather cannons) are being used on allied warships and other targets, and destroy them to Hades. Of course, as one might expect, this is practically (if not just) a suicide mission, but the men- Gregory Peck, Anthony Quinn, David Nicen- all take up the cause to go and do it, along with their own few men who can just kill on a whim... that is, if they need to, such as with a knife or bare-hands.It could be called an anti-war film perhaps, but it's ultimately an action\/adventure movie, and so in its own dimension, it does... make this look exciting and dangerous but the kind us in the audience who may have not gone to war can still get behind. It's realistic fantasy, if that makes sense, and while it's more for the guys I'm sure some women won't mind taking in the main stars (I mean, Anthony Quinn, come on). For all of the intense scenes, such as the cliff climbing during the storm or, of course, the tense climax, it takes a little while for the plot to really get going. It's this exposition one has to kind of just sit up and do the best to pay attention to, knowing full well the plot will take its inevitable twists and turns and we'll be informed on what's going on again anyway (sometimes by an actual maritime clock).Once it does, it keeps going as a relentless mission-flick, and there are two genuinely great scenes (maybe two of the best scenes in any war movie) one is when Anthony Quinn, in a line-up with his fellow British and Greek soldiers standing in front of irate Nazis, tries to get out of the lineup by saying he's just a poor fisherman. A trick, of course, though what's great about the scene (aside from Quinn's performance) is how you're not sure if he'll be taken outside for something and then find a way back in to save the others, or if (as what happens) they all fight back by his own distraction. The other scene is deeper, and perhaps the best serious scene in the film, when the group realizes just before they're about to blow up the guns that they have a traitor in their midst. It's impossible to give anything away, except to say that it has a quintessential use of a silencer in a movie.

The film-makers Joel and Ethan Coen, the writing\/directing team also known as Two Headed Director, are the reason why I believe in the modern movie-making. To take the story like the one Fargo is based on which has been told so many times before and, I am sure, will be told over and over again, to turn and twist it in the most in-anticipated ways, to create the characters so alive and three dimensional that you believe every word they say and every step they take, to provide them with some of the best quotes and dialogs I've ever had pleasure to hear, to mix dry humor and humanity, to make the film recognizable but uniquely beautiful, dark, dramatic, and funny - that's what Coens achieved in Fargo which has been supposedly the Best film they ever made. All of Coens' fans have their own favorite film but it is hard to disagree that with Fargo, Coens sealed the place in Cinema Hall of Fame. Fargo is a movie of many dimensions.

I feel American Beauty is delivering a different dimension of dysfunction. The characters all have their own tales to tell, and the main character isn't the hero as expected.This movie puts us in the shoes of an middle-aged office worker Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) who is in a terrible 20 year marriage to Carolyn (Annette Bening), the real estate agent. When Lester and his wife reluctantly attends their daughter Jane's cheer leading performance, Lester develops an infatuation with her beautiful blond friend Angela Hayes. Lester has fantasies about Angela involving bright red rose petals, and reverts to his 'glory days' of 1973 to impress her and boost his self esteem. Their neighbor Ricky, who's father is a strict marine core officer, is interested in Jane and video tapes a variety of strange things, including her. The relationship between Ricky and Jane is the most stable or loving of them all, although Jane's parents are negligent and unstable, while Ricky's dad is abusive and his mom is aging and incapable of helping anybody in her mental state.A notable aspect was the film's narration. Lester is obviously exhausted from his 42 years of surviving, and says he needs a change. There is a recurring shot of his tree-lined street, as his monotone voice flows from the speakers. Its importance is for Lester's character to describe the apathy he is feeling, but without the drama of his everyday life overwhelming the viewer. The shot recurs seldom in the movie for a slight emphasis on how hectic and pathetic his messed up life is. His wife is cheating on him, a high school student is seducing him and his daughter is dating his drug dealer. It can't get too much worse for Lester Burnham.Another striking feature of the film is the color scheme. Different colors appear in different emotionally or sexually charging scenes in the film. When Lester dreams about Angela, her blond hair is combined with bright red-for instance- as Lester is gazing into his ceiling, he sees a nude Angela with the reddest roses ever digitally created surrounding her and floating back onto him. Those petals contrast with the blue-gray pajamas and sheets he is wearing. The exotic instrumental music behind it creates a visually and audibly interesting scene.This definitely is an American Beauty. It is one of my favorite films, although I would admit it's an acquired taste. It has a disordering plot, engaged narration, and vivid colors to establish important themes. There are so many beautiful things in the world, and this is one of them.

Salles tells a very down to earth story with the use of simple devices. The sets look very raw which adds to the realism of the story. But also the high crime that has dominated much of Brasil is shown in a very subtle way (e.g. the scene where the thief is shot dead and the one about giving children up for 'adoption'). Similarly, the characters are very well defined and easy to relate to. None of them are likable at the beginning but the beautiful transformation, as they develop, wins the viewer's heart.There is a poetic quality to it that, next to the eloquent writing, is also reflected through the lyrical dialogues, the simple soundtrack and Walter Carvalho's expert cinematography. The cross-country Brazilian landscape looks familiar but at the same time breathtaking. The city shots are brilliantly executed capturing the crowd, heat, commotion and chaos and they contrast well with the village sequences.The acting is superb all the way. Marília Pêra is very likable as Dora's friend. In a way she also serves as her conscience as she provokes Dora to rethink her 'immoral' decisions. Vinícius de Oliveira is terrific as Dora's younger counterpart. He holds his own matching wits with Fernanda Montenegro. Their scenes together are the most amusing and moving parts of the film. Finally, it is Montenegro who towers above all with a knockout performance. Her transformation from a bitter, self-centred and greedy spinster to a loving and caring motherly figure is portrayed with sincerity and 'minimalism'. It is both a heartwarming and a heartbreaking performance and only a masterful actress like Fernanda Montenegro has done full justice to the role by defining one of the greatest performances in cinema.It has been almost ten years after which I finally got the opportunity to revisit and re-experience this stunning piece of art.

Producer\/director Herk Harvey fills every shot with something that seems a revelation to me the further the story goes as we segue from reality to nightmare and back in an eventual swirl of surrealism that takes ones breath away. Shot in Lawrence, Kansas and Salt Lake City, Utah, it chronicles the attempt of one Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss) to escape her past especially after she survives a car-falling-from-a-bridge accident. At her new apartment, her only neighbors are the landlady, Mrs. Thomas (Frances Feist) and fellow tenant John Linden (Sidney Berger) who has the hots for her. Her job as the church organist gets her in trouble when the minister (Art Ellison) notices her practicing music that sounds less than sacred so he makes her quit. And Dr. Samuels (Stan Levitt) doesn't believe her when she tells him of seeing the same man (director Herk Harvey) wherever she goes. I'll stop there and just say they all give good performances especially Ms. Hilligoss who's stunning beauty gives a haunting look each time. The scenes at the abandoned Saltair Amusement Park are some of the most effective scenes in the picture especially when those ghouls appear. The organ music of Gene Moore is really chillingly compelling. And certainly John Clifford deserves recognition for writing the whole thing. So on that note, I highly recommend Carnival of Souls.

It starts with a grown brother and sister named Johnny (Russel Streiner who also produced) and Barbra (Judith O'Dea) going to the cemetery to place a wreath on their father's grave. It's there that the first ghoul arrives to attack the sister and kill the brother. When Barbra goes to an abandoned house, Ben (Duane Jones) is the only one there since the dead previous tenant is upstairs with her face skin already eaten. It later turns out there are others emerging from the cellar. Among them are Tom (Keith Wayne), his girlfriend Judy (Judith Ridley who was married to Streiner at the time), Harry Cooper (Karl Hardman, the other producer who also did makeup and engineered the sound effects), and his wife Helen (Marilyn Eastman who would eventually become Hardman's real life spouse). The latter couple's daughter Karen (Kyra Schon who's Hardman's actual offspring) is lying in the cellar since she got bitten by a zombie. I'll stop there and just say while this movie was not completely scary, it was effectively atmospheric and provided a great shock at the end, even more so when the stills (also provided by Hardman) were presented during the closing credits. Some of the dialogue provided by Romero and John A. Russo might have been a little too talky but they do provide enough explanation as to why things happen as they did. And you gotta dig the stock music from the TV series The Fugitive and an eventual MST3K entry called Teenagers from Outer Space. There was later a 30th Anniversary Edition with an added opening and closing scene but I don't recommend that. But I most definitely recommend this, the original Night of the Living Dead.

Also excellent is the realism of this movie; it makes you appreciate what all those pilots and grunts went through during that time. Also, the scenes from the Communist perspective are short but illuminating, and the drum soundtrack gives them additional power. There was no way the Americans could know who the enemy leader was at the time, but later on they did meet and talk with Nguyen Huu An. His role in all this is very well done. Please note Vietnamese wearing a coolie hat and black pajamas are VC; those wearing a uniform--and this applies to the young soldier who charges Col. Moore, too--are member of the North Vietnamese Army. Finally, extra depth is given to the movie by showing the wives coping with it, too; I just marvel at Mrs. Moore and her friend how could they do that? Love, of course; just like their men, they are taking care of their own.Overall, this is a very good movie. Now that somebody has portrayed the first contact between North Vietnamese and American foot soldiers, I hope somebody will come out with the first armor contact between the two armies, at Ben Het in 1969. That would be interesting, too. (Next paragraph contains the spoiler.) Now, the criticism. It's really too bad that Gibson gave in to his desire to hero it up with that fictitious bayonet charge at the end.

In this case Dangerfield in the title role becomes the man who stayed at the governor's mansion.Georgia Governor David Ogden Stiers who slips as neatly into a southern accent as he did a Boston one as Charles Emerson Winchester in MASH is advised that he can score a few cheap political points as a 'family values' candidate by attacking the outrageous talk show host Wally Sparks. Which gets a response from Sparks for Stiers to guest on his show and explain his objections.Then Stiers's son Glenn Walker Harris, Jr. steals an invite to a campaign fundraiser and sends it to Dangerfield who then comes down to Atlanta and promptly injures himself, necessitating he not be moved from there. After The Man Who Came To Dinner, the film then digresses into a pale imitation of The Fortune Cookie as it turns out Dangerfield isn't half as hurt as he makes out. All that was missing was Walter Matthau threatening to sue to the state of Georgia. Talk about deep pockets.The humor is pretty crude, not unlike what you see on these shows. But it's actually done with a gentle hand. There were some lost opportunities in this film to make some valid points. As did those two other far better satirical films which Meet Wally Sparks liberally borrowed from.Still fans of the late Rodney Dangerfeld will respect the film and will some others, just not enough.

","genre":"Comedy"},{"date":"6 October 2009","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" This starts out brilliantly with a 50s flashback sequence and is also very good when we flash back later in the film to see what happened next. The film is well written with the emphasis on comedy. There is not much blood and gore and only flashes of nudity so it's the comedic theme that dominates. In some ways this is a shame because the idea of these alien slugs that derive from some meteorite and dive off to multiply in brains is a good one. Fortunately more recently someone else thought so and created, Slither, which really runs with the idea and makes a much more gut wrenching business of it. Anyway there is some of the sinister little critters here and much to enjoy and laugh along with.
