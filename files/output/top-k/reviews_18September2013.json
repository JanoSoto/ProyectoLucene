I feel like the 1st Matrix was just so eye opening. The way the writer described the world makes it believe that we are truly living in a Matrix. Since this movie came out I feel like the world has slowly opened their eyes to this idea of an alternate reality. There is no one else that could have played Neo but Mr. Reeve's.. He was talked bad upon because of the way he acts but that's him. If Will Smith would have locked down the role of Neo I don't think I would have liked the movie the same. Morpheus was such a big role for anyone to play. He is the reason why the Matrix exists. Without him finding it and trying to find the one, everyone in the world stays asleep.. I also feel like we are in a Matrix and wish Morpheus would call me to give me a pill. Favorite line from the movie...  Yeah everyday, it's called mescaline. I don't know how you can follow up the second and third movie after the first Matrix. It was just so good. The second Matrix Reloaded, had those awesome ghosts. That chases scene on the high way saved the movie for me as far as hype. But the Matrix is the Matrix and you can never take that image of Neo waking up the black screen with the green writing out of your mind. It's burned in there. Thank you for the Matrix. I still watch it till this day all the way through and learn something new. ","genre":null},{"date":"18 September 2013","score":"","review":" This is one of the greatest movie's of all time..

I will always remember this as the movie that made me want to become a filmmaker myself. But enough about me, you're here to read about the movie.Probably the first thing you will notice is that Manhattan was filmed in black in white, and filmed beautifully I might add. Gordon Willis, the cinematographer, out does himself with this movie. From the opening wide shots of NYC in the beginning to the intimate close ups at the end, this movie is BEAUTIFUL to look at. The Gershwin music really helps as well. Rhapsody in Blue fits in perfect with Isaac Davis' monologues in the opening sequence.This movie was written by Woody Allen and writing partner Marshall Brickman. Who also collaborated on Annie Hall, Sleeper, and Manhattan Murder Mystery. I feel, whenever Woody collabs with Marshall, the writing is on point. They make a great team. In Manhattan you get sucked into Woody Allen's world. Filled with one-liners, jazz music, and last but not least adultery. The movie is full of bittersweet humor that will make you life but also has a lot of truth to it. To this day I always remember Michael Murphy's line, Gossip is the new pornography.We can't forget about the romance in this. The movie has many great romantic moments. The love story between Woody Allen's Isaac and Diane Keaton's Mary is one of the best in my opinion. How they begin hating each other but then that hate turns to love is a great scenario. Diane Keaton is at her most stunning in this movie. Her up tight, intellectual character may coming across as annoying to some, but I fell for her the moment she shows up on screen. ALso it's kind of the point for her character to not be so likable i think. I believe this movie shows how the most intellectual people in the world can be so bad at personal relationships. I'll quote Hemingway and say Happiness in intelligent people is one of the rarest things I know. That quote might some up the whole movie for you.I could keep on rambling on but it all comes down to your own opinion. In my opinion I think Manhattan is one of the great romance movies out there and you should definitely check it out.

To me the name of the movie really can say a lot about it. ''Clockwork'' meaning mechanical. When Alex is arrested he is then placed in a mental hospital where they basically brainwash him to be good. Well, what this movie really symbolizes is you can't play the role of God. Alex is being forced to be good when it's not in his nature. ''Orange'' actually represents a person. How their bright and can stand out. They're simply trying to take is individuality away. They're just trying to make him mechanical. After all the therapy and brainwashing he endures he realizes that every time he is exposed to violence he gets ill. And at a few other scenes in the movie you notice he gets ill from hearing Beethoven.(something he actually found beauty in) Which at some point drives him crazy and he attempts suicide. As he lays in the hospital and promises to keep what really happened secret it shows how he is no longer brainwashed. This is shown when they play Beethoven in the background and his sudden vision at the end. It also represents that you can never mold someone into what they are not. You can't change someone if they don't want to be changed.

The movie became a heavy-handed indictment of Alcatraz and the penal system, which they entirely deserve, but the method was still too crude to be really effective.The movie story is realistic in a number of important details.

The fictional characterizations felt concocted and unreal, Hollywoodized.So, overall, it was a bit of a slog through it.I watched this a second time, and I'm off the same opinion. This time I'd point out that Kevin Bacon's performance is terrific. The movie has way too much phony stuff in it that detracts, not adds, to its theme. The story and screenplay are at fault. The direction also should have been toned down. If this is the only way to indict the penal system, through using a man who was a murderer and robber before being sent to Alcatraz and to falsifying much else, then movie-making is in bad trouble.

The first cinematic appearance of one of the scariest movie serial killers of all time. I have seen all the Hannibal films with Anthony Hopkins in it. To be honest I thought Silence Of The Lambs was overrated but I still enjoyed it, Hannibal was laughable and aside from visual style there is not much going for it as a crime\/thriller, Red Dragon was actually my favourite. I think that had to do with the story (or the character of Will Graeme was very interesting). I did want to see this and now I'll tell you what I think.The plot of this film (if you don't know or haven't seen Red Dragon) is that Will Graeme is an ex-FBI agent that has such an understanding of how serial killers think that he is treading a thin line between insanity and doing his job. He gets called back to investigate a serial killer Tooth Fairy because of his teeth, of which have been analyzed forensically. The Tooth Fairy is a lunatic who brutally slaughters families and puts broken pieces of mirrors into their eye sockets. He goes somewhere with how the tooth fairy thinks but it isn't enough to work out who he is. He goes for the help of a psychologist\/convicted serial killer Dr Hannibal Lecter.Now the acting is great. I know I'm in a minority opinion but I think Brian Cox is actually a better Hannibal than Anthony Hopkins (don't get me wrong, Hopkins also does a very good job). I think that William Petersen also does a very good job as Will Graeme. For a fact everyone here does an excellent job.I also love the atmosphere of this film. Most of the scenes in this film are very atmospheric and really gives off a creepy vibe. In particular the scenes where Graeme is looking through the house and trying to get into the mind of the Tooth Fairy and the scene where he talks to Lecter for the first time among others.So would I recommend this film? In all honesty, Yes. I think that this is certainly worth watching. If you have the slightest interest in this sort of thing then I would certainly recommend you this movie. I am not saying you'll prefer this to the more recent incarnations of Hannibal. But it is a good little crime\/thriller that is certainly worth at least one look.

Most of the scenes in this film are very atmospheric and really gives off a creepy vibe. In particular the scenes where Graeme is looking through the house and trying to get into the mind of the Tooth Fairy and the scene where he talks to Lecter for the first time among others.So would I recommend this film? In all honesty, Yes. I think that this is certainly worth watching. If you have the slightest interest in this sort of thing then I would certainly recommend you this movie. I am not saying you'll prefer this to the more recent incarnations of Hannibal. But it is a good little crime\/thriller that is certainly worth at least one look. ","genre":"Crime, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"18 September 2013","score":"","review":" Here it is, Manhunter. The first cinematic appearance of one of the scariest movie serial killers of all time. I have seen all the Hannibal films with Anthony Hopkins in it. To be honest I thought Silence Of The Lambs was overrated but I still enjoyed it, Hannibal was laughable and aside from visual style there is not much going for it as a crime\/thriller, Red Dragon was actually my favourite. I think that had to do with the story (or the character of Will Graeme was very interesting). I did want to see this and now I'll tell you what I think.The plot of this film (if you don't know or haven't seen Red Dragon) is that Will Graeme is an ex-FBI agent that has such an understanding of how serial killers think that he is treading a thin line between insanity and doing his job. He gets called back to investigate a serial killer Tooth Fairy because of his teeth, of which have been analyzed forensically. The Tooth Fairy is a lunatic who brutally slaughters families and puts broken pieces of mirrors into their eye sockets. He goes somewhere with how the tooth fairy thinks but it isn't enough to work out who he is. He goes for the help of a psychologist\/convicted serial killer Dr Hannibal Lecter.Now the acting is great. I know I'm in a minority opinion but I think Brian Cox is actually a better Hannibal than Anthony Hopkins (don't get me wrong, Hopkins also does a very good job). I think that William Petersen also does a very good job as Will Graeme. For a fact everyone here does an excellent job.I also love the atmosphere of this film.

I was rather confused throughout most the film. I did however like the story near more the beginning; the mystery around the whole madeleine character was rather intriguing, especially when the hotel housekeeper said she had not visited her room. I also liked how the audience saw the story threw Scotties eyes, not knowing about Judy until the flashback revealing everything. However I lost interest greatly when the flashback was shown as it answered the mystery of what was happening\/happened to Madeleine (personally I would have kept the flashback till Scotty takes Judy to the tower) I think the Characters are a little boring, it took me a while to because interested and invested in the character, it did weird me out a bit when Scottie went a bit phyco and abusive towards Judy as he didn't seem to be that type of character up to that point.

","genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"18 September 2013","score":"","review":" Nicholas Ray's Rebel Without A Cause stars James Dean as Jim Stark, a young man who clashes with his parents and classmates. Dean would die in a car accident four weeks prior to the film's release, lending a mythic resonance to his portrayal of a troubled teenager.A companion-piece to Ray's Bigger Than Life (1956), Rebel Without A Cause (1955) share's the latter film's voluptuous qualities. Ray's colours zap the eyes-balls, his emotions grand, his music pounding, the film's melodrama unashamedly bombastic. Elsewhere Ray's favourite preoccupations pop up the existential malaise simmering beneath 1950s suburbia, castrated males who wish to affirm themselves, striking uses of the colour red (recalling his Johnny Guitar), lonely characters who find each other etc etc. Amplifying the film's alienation are Ray's sets, which include an abandoned mansion and a vast planetarium, in which lecturers speak of man's insignificance even as teens jostle for attention and adoration.Ray's films are oft about sensitive loners. Here he gives us three characters &#x96; Jim, Judy and Plato &#x96; who must negotiate strained familial circumstances. Plato's without parents, Judy's shown little affection by her dad and Jim views his father, who is unwilling to stand up to an overbearing wife, as being emasculated. All three struggle with prescribed gender roles, until the film ends with a climax in which the trio mix strength and sensitivity to form their own working family unit.The film's attempts at psychoanalysis are at times clunky. Plato's homosexual, a fact which he attempts to mask with violent masculinity. Jim's straight, but similarly displaced. If only I belonged some place, he says, some place where I didn't have to be all confused and ashamed! Judy's likewise struggling with acceptance. On the cusp of womanhood, but still a child, she mimics everyone around her in an attempt to fit in.Despair and a longing for connection are traits common in Ray's films. That he mixes these themes with overt existentialism (Man, existing alone, is of little consequence, one character outright says) lends him the aura of a romantic, Suffering Artist. Ray was himself bisexual (as was James Dean), and during the production of Rebel was rumoured to have been sleeping with both Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo, the actors who play Judy and Plato. Wood was also reportedly sleeping with another co-star, a young Dennis Hopper. Her on-screen persona was similarly frisky, Wood often playing sex-starved young women.Rebel Without a Cause is often touted as being the first representation of post-war teen malaise. That's not true. Films like Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt predate it by almost a decade. The Wild One and The Blackboard Jungle beat Rebel by a few years as well. What's true is that Rebel's the first of a certain type of teen problem picture. It also captured well its Zeitgeist. This was an era in which the studio system was on its last legs, in which a new generation was casting away the rules and mores of those who came before, and in which the political movements of the sixties were slowly rearing their heads. Wood, the sex goddess of her era, was herself a transitional star, straddling Hollywood's classic studio system and the independent free-for-alls that came later.James Dean's reputation was largely the result of hype and studio marketing. But like Brando, Newman and Montgomery Clift, he also brought a new type of acting into the mainstream. As a result, virtually everything he does in Rebel has become iconographic, from the way he turns up his collar, to his whispered dialogue, to his graceful body motions. In Ray's films, that which is feminine is oft made masculine is made feminine again. Dean, of course, tends to do this without Ray's input, a sexy blend which has led to him, and this film in particular, becoming a fetish object for the James Dean cult.After In A Lonely Place, Rebel Without A Cause is arguably Ray's most atmospheric film.

Ray's colours zap the eyes-balls, his emotions grand, his music pounding, the film's melodrama unashamedly bombastic. Elsewhere Ray's favourite preoccupations pop up the existential malaise simmering beneath 1950s suburbia, castrated males who wish to affirm themselves, striking uses of the colour red (recalling his Johnny Guitar), lonely characters who find each other etc etc. Amplifying the film's alienation are Ray's sets, which include an abandoned mansion and a vast planetarium, in which lecturers speak of man's insignificance even as teens jostle for attention and adoration.Ray's films are oft about sensitive loners. Here he gives us three characters &#x96; Jim, Judy and Plato &#x96; who must negotiate strained familial circumstances. Plato's without parents, Judy's shown little affection by her dad and Jim views his father, who is unwilling to stand up to an overbearing wife, as being emasculated. All three struggle with prescribed gender roles, until the film ends with a climax in which the trio mix strength and sensitivity to form their own working family unit.The film's attempts at psychoanalysis are at times clunky. Plato's homosexual, a fact which he attempts to mask with violent masculinity. Jim's straight, but similarly displaced. If only I belonged some place, he says, some place where I didn't have to be all confused and ashamed! Judy's likewise struggling with acceptance. On the cusp of womanhood, but still a child, she mimics everyone around her in an attempt to fit in.Despair and a longing for connection are traits common in Ray's films. That he mixes these themes with overt existentialism (Man, existing alone, is of little consequence, one character outright says) lends him the aura of a romantic, Suffering Artist. Ray was himself bisexual (as was James Dean), and during the production of Rebel was rumoured to have been sleeping with both Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo, the actors who play Judy and Plato. Wood was also reportedly sleeping with another co-star, a young Dennis Hopper. Her on-screen persona was similarly frisky, Wood often playing sex-starved young women.Rebel Without a Cause is often touted as being the first representation of post-war teen malaise. That's not true. Films like Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt predate it by almost a decade. The Wild One and The Blackboard Jungle beat Rebel by a few years as well. What's true is that Rebel's the first of a certain type of teen problem picture. It also captured well its Zeitgeist. This was an era in which the studio system was on its last legs, in which a new generation was casting away the rules and mores of those who came before, and in which the political movements of the sixties were slowly rearing their heads. Wood, the sex goddess of her era, was herself a transitional star, straddling Hollywood's classic studio system and the independent free-for-alls that came later.James Dean's reputation was largely the result of hype and studio marketing. But like Brando, Newman and Montgomery Clift, he also brought a new type of acting into the mainstream. As a result, virtually everything he does in Rebel has become iconographic, from the way he turns up his collar, to his whispered dialogue, to his graceful body motions. In Ray's films, that which is feminine is oft made masculine is made feminine again. Dean, of course, tends to do this without Ray's input, a sexy blend which has led to him, and this film in particular, becoming a fetish object for the James Dean cult.After In A Lonely Place, Rebel Without A Cause is arguably Ray's most atmospheric film.

Praising it has become a pretty traditional thing to do, and if you dare criticize it, then you must endure not just the cult-fanbase but the Kubrick-fanbase. I wouldn't wish backlash from both of those groups on an enemy.Howeer, I shouldn't be hearing it from either. Stanley Kubrick's controversial classic is a troubling but required watch, adapted from Anthony Burgess's novel, which is rumored to be inspired from a personal instance. Burgess's wife was brutally assaulted by a group of thugs at one point, and Burgess tried to penetrate the psychology of such unconscionable men who would dare commit such a disgusting, degrading act. If this is true - and Kubrick left Burgess's message from the novel in tact - then the stance he takes here is stunningly humanistic and brave.The film stars a young, energetic Malcolm McDowell as Alex, a young man who commits unsightly atrocities such as rape and assault upon getting innocent people to open their doors thinking they're doing a helpless soul a favor who they believe was in a car-wreck. He commits these crimes with a gang of men he calls his droogs, and their spree resorts to an ugly but surprisingly professional scene of rape. During this scene, Alex sings a familiar song you will not see in the same light again (similar to how Alex will later react to a specific song, but I'm getting ahead of myself).Alex is eventually arrested and thrown into prison, but he's given an option upon entering the compound. He can be simply jailed or he can be psychologically conditioned - a new process that can help him - to be good and moral. He chooses to be conditioned and undergoes a series of mentally trying tests that take his individuality, regardless of how despicable it is, along with the basic qualities of him being a human with free-will. After the lengthy psychological processes are complete, he's released back into society as a changed man.Though it predated techno-music pioneer Gary Numan's career by a few years, A Clockwork Orange seems like a cinematic adaptation of one of Numan's darkest, eeriest songs. From the stunningly cold voice of Alex, to the futuristic, dystopian environment, to the beautifully polished set-designs, it seems as if this is a Gary Numan song with the benefit of being a one-hundred and thirty-eight minute music video. All I was waiting for in the end was the Machman to show up.Moreover, the content of this film is widely known to be explicit and still somewhat shocking to this date. But make no mistake in saying the film is mean-spirited just to be mean-spirited. The film's commentary on psychological conditioning taking away human individuality and free will and devaluing ones worth to making him a conforming citizen in a world with diminishing uniqueness is strong and potent. A Clockwork Orange isn't an exploitation film and it isn't a film with violence for violence's sake. The film goes to great lengths to detail psychology and conditioning to the point where it wouldn't be a stretch to name it one of the field's biggest films.The film is also another case where the lead actor and director team up to make an incredible match. Malcolm McDowell gives a tremendous performance here that's troubling, alive, and coldly inspiring. McDowell is only elevated by Stanley Kubrick's typically wide-angle shots and very spacious long shots that show the landscape of the shots and the futuristic design of Kubrick's vision. These talents combined give A Clockwork Orange the strong performance and directorial leverage it needs to communicate its story and message significantly.Finally, it must be said that A Clockwork Orange was going to be a challenge to adapt to the screen no matter assumed what position. The novel is more heavy on the slang than the film, and featured a large glossary in the back of the book defining every word clearly. The film doesn't have that privilege and likely several others that are exclusive to the novel. As all book-to-movie adaptations, the film provides the benefits of a specific (not an absolute, as many confuse) vision of the novel's work and, as a result, may offer the best adaptation one will ever see of the novel.Starring Malcolm McDowell.

The first requested change is to make it a man and two women, and the women have an affair, changes that make it a totally different story.Of course Guest is his own guy, a truly independent filmmaker, known for shooting 5X or 10X or more film than is needed, and building a movie in the editing room. So this is his parody on the corporate Hollywood machine, and how a young filmmaker needs to stick to his principles.I found it mildly interesting, it was also fun to see some of today's veteran actors in younger roles.

It obviously wasn't the same film called Mousehunt that I was as the one that I saw was about as funny as seeing someone you love get clubbed to death in front of your eyes while he or she is in the same room as you and is no more than a yard away when it happens! I take that back. Seeing someone you love get clubbed to death in front of your eyes while he or she is in the same room as you and is no more than a yard away when it happens would actually be a whole lot funnier! All those that say this is Laurel and Hardy meets Tom and Jerry are paying a GIGTANIC disservice to Laurel and Hardy and Tom and Jerry! It is nothing like either of them as everything they are in is exceptionally worth viewing, this is not! AVOID! I WISH I COULD GIVE THIS BORING, DREARY, DULL, HORRIBLE ONE AND A HALF HOURS OF CRAP NOUGHT (ZERO TO ANYONE WHO IS NOT English\/British) STARS BUT UNFORTUNITELY I CAN'T!

","genre":"Comedy, Family"},{"date":"18 September 2013","score":"","review":" Tom Hanks plays Forrest Gump in Robert Zemekis's Academy Award winning(Best picture, director, & actor) fable about a simple and honest man who finds himself floating through life like(the ever-present) feather in the wind. He is often bullied growing up, but finds solace in his best friend Jenny, whom he comes to love dearly as they get older. She tells him to run Forrest, run and he does, and one day runs into a football game, inspiring the coach to put him on the team, which makes him more popular, though at graduation he joins the military, where he fits right in, much to the bewilderment of his superior officer, Lt. Dan(played by Gary Sinise) whose life he saves, giving him a medal and inspiring him to be a Ping-Pong champion, where he meets three different U.S. Presidents, and later becomes a multi-millionaire by investing in a fruit company that takes off in a big way. He loves his mother(played by Sally Field) and takes her departure quite hard, running a marathon across the country for years, until he meets up with the elusive Jenny once again...Epic-scale character study is supremely well crafted and acted, remaining a funny, moving, and inspired drama about how one good man can affect the world around him, and still not know it, and remain uncorrupted by it. A truly marvelous achievement by all.
