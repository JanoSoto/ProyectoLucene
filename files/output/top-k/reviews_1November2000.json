One person went so far as to make the comment that Chinese people just do not know how to make movies. and It had a really bad plot. COME ON PEOPLE! It's a Jackie Chan movie, you don't walk into a Jackie Chan movie expecting an intricate plot and multi million dollar special effects. Chan's physical humor and amazingly choreographed fight scenes are special enough without the aid of computers. Now don't get me wrong, I love great films, I would much rather watch a Fellini, Kurosawa, or Kubrick film then the latest new release, but I also have a special place in my heart for just flat out fun action movies. The barebone plot of the movie just serves as a stage for Jackie to flow through performing amazing stunt after amazing stunt. And someone made a comment about seeing a wire! Please, the fact that you saw a wire doesn't make a film bad, the incident mentioned must not have been very obvious either because I havn't noticed it in the 5 times that I've watched the movie. I havn't seen the U.S. release because of the dubbing, but I own a copy on tape and I'll be watching it regularly and I recommend that anyone who hasn't seen the movie at least give it a chance going into the movie remembering that it's a JACKIE CHAN movie.

The film's production is incredible and despite the reported $12.5 million figure for the budget, the film looked like a $70 million production! Just look at the number of extras used, the sets, the costumes, the locations (China is a very beautiful country!) the stunts, and the list goes on!To stress out why the film is the best! The cast is virtually perfect! Chow Yun-Fat, who's more known with those gun man roles, is simply the best to play Li Mu Bai. Chow's calm, combined with the character's wisdom, showed that the role was like it was made for him. Michelle Yeoh's acting adds maturity to the story, and as great as she performs martial arts, she acts great! Ziyi Zhang is easily one of the most promising young actresses in the world, and you'll see why. The supporting cast is very great too! Pei-Pei Cheng's Jade Fox is very expressive, very wise and it gives the film a strong presence of opposition. The martial arts scenes are perfect! Woo-ping Yuen, who choreographed the martial arts scenes in the usually over-rated The Matrix, worked harder and better in this film. As far as martial arts go, Crouching Tiger is easily the best of them all not just because of the amount of action, not just because of the kind of styles used, but because Woo-ping dedicated a lot of research and heart. The result is a martial arts fest that connects itself with character expression and story flow. And if you think The Matrix is the greatest martial arts fest, you're very wrong! Crouching Tiger easily destroys The Matrix into a billion pieces! As if that's not enough, Crouching Tiger's story and character development is so deep it renders The Matrix obsolete and worthless.Acting and action speaking, Crouching Tiger never failed me. Like the tradition of Chinese epics, we see the stars act and perform the action themselves! If you thought Chow Yun-Fat's only good with guns, you'll be shocked to see how he performs martials arts here. Even Pei-Pei Cheng, an old chubby lady, would shock you with her moves. Cheng showed that even women in her age and build can move fast and fight with greatness! Michelle Yeoh still fights as great as she did when she was young. As for Ziyi Zhang, she makes a great martial artist!Heck, if you put Keanu Reeves up against any of the above mentioned stars (or anyone in the film), he would either chicken out or easily be defeated!Ang Lee's direction reminds me a bit of Irvin Kershner's work in The Empire Strikes Back. Aside from the use of fight scenes and some special effects, Lee brought out a lot of expression and drama from the characters to the point where the viewer sees everyone here in a high level of being human.Crouching Tiger's story is one of a kind. A great sword gets stolen, then the story pushes on with unmatched expression, very nice twists, characters express a lot of themselves, viewers get to learn some very valuable lessons and morales, and the story ends with one of the most unique endings I've ever seen in any movie!Use of music is done greatly, and it perfectly fits the mood and what goes on. CoCo Lee's theme song A Love Before Time is the best movie song I've heard in a long time. I feel it should be nominated for the next Oscars, and that goes the same with the musical scoring.Now that I've seen this film in the theaters, I now look towards the upcoming DVD version. And to those of you who read this review, I highly-recommend watching this. You'll be amazed and entertained with greatness!

This one falls definitely in the second category. It begins interestingly enough, with a situation most of us know a man, his children, his young new wife, his embittered ex-wife. But director Chris Columbus's only interest is to pump the saccharine in until the audience gags. So, the conflict is not solved in any ordinary fashion, but by the middle of the movie they get Jackie, the ex-wife, with cancer. Just asking, do you think the authors of this would have had a brain hemorrhage if they tried to find a solution that did not involve cancer? The way these Hollywood people hurl cancer about makes you think that they never had to see a loved person die of this horrible disease, otherwise they would show some respect. The makers of this movie also have a curious concept about cancer. They apparently believe that it is like hemorrhoids if you don't tell people you have it, they will never notice. I don't just mean that cancer only makes Jackie look a trifle paler. I don't guess people would enjoy to see someone who really looks as if they had cancer in a Hollywood movie, but also, Jackie hides her disease from everyone in the family, apparently with success. We are even told that she had had a tumor operated a year ago, and nobody noticed! I mean, this is not the kind of operation you can walk home immediately afterwards. She had had to stay in the hospital for at least a couple of days, and, even after she was home, certainly she must have had to recover for several days. How did she explain that? That she was getting herself a complete liposuction job done? This kept me worried during the rest of the movie.They have also some curious concepts about women, too. They apparently believe that a professional woman who is good at her job just has to be hopelessly incompetent in most other areas. Also, we are to believe that Jackie is the perfect mom, just because she owns a Singer machine and because she can always remember her children's schedule, but she is also teaching her children to be rude and bitter, and she also keeps on pulling stunts like the one with the Pearl Jam tickets... now is that supposed to be adult behavior? Also, which is Jackie's source of income? Because she does not work, despises women who do and nevertheless she has a huge house with park and horses. Is she an heiress? Did she win the Lotto? Her husband pays her such an enormous alimony? Is she a closet drug-baroness?

This one falls definitely in the second category. It begins interestingly enough, with a situation most of us know a man, his children, his young new wife, his embittered ex-wife. But director Chris Columbus's only interest is to pump the saccharine in until the audience gags. So, the conflict is not solved in any ordinary fashion, but by the middle of the movie they get Jackie, the ex-wife, with cancer. Just asking, do you think the authors of this would have had a brain hemorrhage if they tried to find a solution that did not involve cancer? The way these Hollywood people hurl cancer about makes you think that they never had to see a loved person die of this horrible disease, otherwise they would show some respect. The makers of this movie also have a curious concept about cancer. They apparently believe that it is like hemorrhoids if you don't tell people you have it, they will never notice. I don't just mean that cancer only makes Jackie look a trifle paler. I don't guess people would enjoy to see someone who really looks as if they had cancer in a Hollywood movie, but also, Jackie hides her disease from everyone in the family, apparently with success. We are even told that she had had a tumor operated a year ago, and nobody noticed! I mean, this is not the kind of operation you can walk home immediately afterwards. She had had to stay in the hospital for at least a couple of days, and, even after she was home, certainly she must have had to recover for several days. How did she explain that? That she was getting herself a complete liposuction job done? This kept me worried during the rest of the movie.They have also some curious concepts about women, too.

Do they just not care or get so caught up in small details that they miss the overtly obvious underlying message.  I went into the movie not really knowing the plot and having only seen a few previews; so I was wide open for what was going to happen in the film.  To me this was a great movie, mainly because I really didnt have high expectations of it.  I thought the acting was very good especially from Spacey and Osment.  There were so many points made in the movie it was ridiculous.  The actually theory of pay it forward was great, but I can see that our belief as a whole in the decency of man has all but disappeared.  The motherhood or lack of parental guidance is extremely powerful.  The sheer emotion Osment puts behind Trevor just wanting a mother that truly loves him is powerful. The scene with Spacey and Hunt outside Simonette's apartment as he explains what it feels like to be that son with the overly stupid and nieve mother was well needed for many woman.  Then the ending that so many are disgusted in was great to me.  Sure I would have preferred a different ending, but the one that was there stuck out almost more than anything in my mind.  (DISCLAIMER SPOILER AHEAD!!!)  The fact that he touched so many people was awesome, but only believers would have felt that.  Plus what I got out of the movie, especially the ending was that one young man, a son, gave his life for what he believed in so that he might make the world a better place.  That should sound familiar, if u dont know what Im talking about try opening a bible and increase your knowledge in areas that really matter!!!

Now I can just laugh when I see Frances Play connect the dots on Cyrus's butt....hehehehe. Its hilarious when nathen keeps Slapping Zack around, everytime he opens his mouth. So what this movie is cheap, Its a 80s horror movie, Horror movies arn't supposed to have a huge budget. This movie  frightened me very much like back in, 1988, when I was like, 7. Now I love this movie, it rocks. I dont understand why all these people are giving this movie such bad reviews. one thing I dont understand is, how come the lady who played Frances never made any other movies except this one. She should of. I dont get how someone can make one movie 15 years ago, and never make one again. Its weird. But, Anyway, I wanna suggest something to the IMDB. In the Memorable Quotes section for this movie, you gotta put the line when Cyrus says  What are ya doin back there  to Frances. And She answers Connect The Dots , That scene is so funny, so you gotta put it in there man. take my advice IMDB. your right DHYDES, this movie is a great metomorphis type Horror movie. Another movie that you should have listed is The Exorcist, Thats the best Metomorphis style horror movie, next to the Curse, I think. Those were the only movies that ever really scared me( The Curse and the Exorcist). they're both very similar in many ways, cause they both deal with innocent people getting all messed up, getting all gross, and acting crazy.
