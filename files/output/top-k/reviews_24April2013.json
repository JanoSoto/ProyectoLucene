And yes, the film actually carries a warning undertone, showing why people like Tyler Durden cannot be correct.It's hard to tell yourself that when you're watching the actual film though. Because in all honesty Brad Pitt is so good in this film, so magnificently charismatic, that it's no wonder that some people actually went and started their own fight clubs. No wonder that Tyler Durden has been voted the best movie character of all time numerous times. The man is that good in his role. And it is a distinct possibility that our society would be better off if he weren't, because in all honesty Tyler Durden is everything that we shouldn't be.And that's what makes this film so damn good. It is the ugly underbelly of human condition, of modern society. It's not nice to look at, it won't make you feel any better, but damn if isn't one heck of a trip to experience. This movie is so convinced that what it's saying is the God's truth that you have no choice but to be pulled in, even momentarily.But it's not just the message. It's a great movie even without the story and the character of Tyler Durden.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"24 April 2013","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" A pure amazing intriguing masterpiece from legendary director Alfred Hitchcock. Rope is Hitchcock's first color film, taking place in real time and being edited so as to appear as a single continuous shot through the use of long takes. The movie also deals with one settling the room in which, murder has happen. Adapted from Patrick Hamilton's stage play, Rope's End. The story is loosely inspired by the Leopold-Loeb case of 1924, where the two were motivated to murder a boy name Franks by their desire to commit a perfect crime. This story follows, a similar plot, it concerns two implicitly homosexual brilliant young college students who strangle to death a former classmate, David Kentley (Dick Hogan) not only to commit a crime, but also try to get away of it. In their own twisted way, they wanted to risk getting catch, for the thrill, by hiding the body in an antique chest in the middle of their posh apartment, then perversely arrange to hold a dinner party around the chest, inviting the victim's family, friends and David's fiancée Janet (Joan Chandler), as well as their intellectual role-model Stewart. John Dall was brilliant in his role as Brandon Shaw. Reminds me a bit of Victor Price in a way. The way Joan Chandler and John Dall played off each other with perfect timing and grace. Dall with his slight stammer and superb sinister smirk was amazing. Farley Granger as Phillip Morgan was also great. The imperceptible movements of eyes or facial muscles when fear of getting discovered by their teacher Rupert Cadall was great. I love that moment when the maid is clearing off the top of the chest; that scene is one of the most tense moments in all of that film. Sadly the movie's suspense is a little bit cut away, due to Alfred Hitchcock showing in the first few frames of film, the two killing David. It would have work better, if we don't know if there is a body or not in the chest. James Stewart was great as the Nietzschean philosophy teacher that serve as the boy's mentor. Rupert believes that murder is an art where a selected few feels justified due to the concept of the übermensch or superman. Those who believe in the concepts of right and wrong and behave accordingly are deemed inferior beings and therefore unnecessary. While those who are enlightened enough to realize that one is free to act according to their own volition because there are no such primitive or external constraints on behavior are deemed superior. In this worldview, homicide is justifiable because the intellectually superior are actually bettering society by eliminating the inferior and their drain on its resources. In a way, Professor Cadell is no better than the two, because he taught Phillip and Brandon these nihilistic concepts to begins with. It's only when he believes to suspect that they practiced what he preached that he sees his wrongs. I think it's a bit too dark of a character for James Stewart to act, and that's probably why not a lot of people went to see this movie when it came out. I doubt a lot of people want to see James Stewart in this role. I know Hitchcock wanted Cary Grant at first, but I really don't see him in the character. Hitchcock's second choice, James Mason would fit perfect. I like how Alfred Hitchcock add dialogue talking about his choice in actors in the film. Still, James Stewart works with what he got, and added a sense of humor and charm to the character. The screenplay by Arthur Laurents is witty, and great. The dialogue is full of cleaver puns, and sayings. The killers make snippy, veiled comments about their deed, never going so far as to reveal the existence of the body nor their involvement in the murder. A lot of people didn't see it because of the homosexual tension. I have to say this movie, this movie pretty much limited the homosexual subtext to the point, that it's nearly impossible to notice. The camera work is astounding as he abandon many standard film techniques to allow for the long unbroken scenes. Each shot ran continuously for up to ten minutes without interruption. It was shot on a single set, aside from the opening establishing shot street scene under the credits. Camera moves were carefully planned and there was almost no editing. Every other segment ends by panning against or tracking into an object, the back of a piece of furniture or a man's jacket blocking the entire screen, for example. In this way, Hitchcock effectively masked half the cuts in the film. The extraordinary cyclorama of the city in the background of the apartment was interesting. The color lighting differs as sunset slowly unfolds as the movie progresses. Within the course of the film the clouds made of spun glass change position and shape eight times. Sometimes it can be staginess due to it being compensated for with tricks of some kind, but this movie was constrained by having to change reels or the length of the movie reels, since it was filmed in real and reel time. So it can be a bit annoying. It's not like knotty mess like some people view it. For me I love the film. It had many good elements that I really liked. I thought the character development was very good, and it did become more and more suspenseful all the way until the end. Also it's has the Hitchcock's cameo in the beginning. So check it out, and learn the ropes.

At the time that the film came out, it was pretty revolutionary.

John Woo made A Better Tomorrow Parts 1 & 2 prior to The Killer, and they were definitely good, but The Killer reached perfection when compared. His slick camera moves and seamless action were polished.When viewed today, the action is still seamless and amazing, but thanks to today's action films being more realistic, you may encounter that there is hardly reloading in this film. That tends to throw people off a bit from the film. I have to also admit that some of the drama in the film is dated. This can turn off some viewers and can be seen as corny, especially with the music. It's still enjoyable don't get me wrong, but it feels dated, but the action almost instantly makes you forget that this movie is about 24 years old.To watch this film, you have to just forget about all the crap you've watched recently and just sit back, relax, and don't think too hard when you watch this film. The story is easy to follow and enjoyable. Sometimes the hype of a film can end up turning people off once they start watching it since it may not be what they expected. So when you watch this film, forget about what people might have told you and just watch it.Many people are very critical of this film today but if they look at it through the context of when it came out, it tends to be better appreciated. I'd rather that Hollywood went back to this old style action with rich color rather than the pale color filtered movies that are coming out today. I consider this to be John Woo's best with emotional moments and signature action. Now, if you're really looking for when John Woo completely polished his action, I recommend HARD BOILED.

That tends to throw people off a bit from the film. I have to also admit that some of the drama in the film is dated. This can turn off some viewers and can be seen as corny, especially with the music. It's still enjoyable don't get me wrong, but it feels dated, but the action almost instantly makes you forget that this movie is about 24 years old.To watch this film, you have to just forget about all the crap you've watched recently and just sit back, relax, and don't think too hard when you watch this film. The story is easy to follow and enjoyable. Sometimes the hype of a film can end up turning people off once they start watching it since it may not be what they expected. So when you watch this film, forget about what people might have told you and just watch it.Many people are very critical of this film today but if they look at it through the context of when it came out, it tends to be better appreciated. I'd rather that Hollywood went back to this old style action with rich color rather than the pale color filtered movies that are coming out today. I consider this to be John Woo's best with emotional moments and signature action. Now, if you're really looking for when John Woo completely polished his action, I recommend HARD BOILED. As for his Hollywood films, I really don't consider them in the same league as his original films.What happened to the days when there were actual stunts and real explosions???

Its central premise surrounds the biblical myth about the birth of the Antichrist and the inevitable doom which will it bring. Add to that creepy and effective score, great performances, good script and rock solid direction and you will get a horror classic.Like The Shining, Omen relies on build up, suspense and performances to bring the scares rather than go for the gore and jump scares. Plus, you can never go wrong when you cast classic Hollywood actors as your leads in horror movies. Gregory Peck is absolutely brilliant as the lead and gives his performance much intensity. This could have been even cooler if they could have gotten Jimmy Stewart or Henry Fonda for the part. I just love when these old-school actors appear in movies where people suffer gory deaths and swear a lot. The rest of the cast is great. David Warner gives his usual powerhouse performance, Patrick Troughton is great but sadly he is in it for few scenes and Billie Whitelaw is wonderfully creepy as the satanist governess.The direction by Richard Donner is as rock solid as you might expect from him. He knows where to put the camera and understands that characters and atmosphere are more essential to good horror rather than silly jump scares and gore. The score by Jerry Goldsmith is absolutely phenomenal and sends the chills up my spine. Without it, The Omen wouldn't be half as creepy and unsettling as it is. The only real faults with the film, lies in the script. There are few dodgy moments that would make some people shout at the screen. How in the hell, the parents couldn't tell that their governess was up for no good. Nearly the whole first 30 or 40 minutes the parents acted fairly stupid and because the plot said so. But after that, it got much better and felt much more natural. But aside from some inconsistencies, The Omen is absolutely fantastic.The Omen is a must see for any horror fans. It's as good as mainstream horror will ever get. And watching the ultimate good guy Gregory Peck in a satanic horror film is always nice. If you are looking for boobs, booze and teenagers partying, you won't find it here.

The Maltese Falcon possesses all of these, a surprising feat because this is the third version of the same story, all gathered together now on a DVD which shows each of their individualities if not varying qualities. While elements of film noir existed in films long before this one came along, this became the definitive detective story upon whose basis the structure of film noir began.While the 1931 version of this is certainly a good film, this version is simply perfect, taking what had already been well done, later messed with (1936's Satan Met a Lady) and fixed it to become an all-time classic. There's no sentiment or subtly to the toughness of the characters in this film, all amoral in one way or another, and all out for themselves. Even Sam Spade's loyal secretary (Lee Patrick) gets a bit more hard boiled than usual, and when the film got a misguided sequel (The Black Bird in 1975), Patrick was back, giving her character a really tough old bird viewpoint that makes you wonder what transpired in this character's life over the intervening 34 years.There's traces of rawness in the dialog that somehow the production code didn't pick up, particularly with some gay references (in a pedophile manner) concerning Peter Lorre's Joel Cairo. Yes, he is sleazier here than any other film he ever did, and that is saying a lot. There's more subtlety for Sydney Greenstreet's fat man than Dudley Digges in the 1931 version, but there's no denying that every time this man appears on screen, he is commanding attention. Elisha Cook Jr. (who also re-appeared in The Black Bird) takes cowardly menace to a new level, creating a film noir archetype that he would repeat many times.The biggest praise for me here goes to Mary Astor as Bridget O'Shaugnessy, the femme fatal, an aging vixen still filled with sex appeal that she would show even in films into the 1950's. Had she not won a well-deserved Oscar for the same year's The Great Lie, she surely would have taken it home for this.

I found this in a 1997 Texas Monthly feature  All reliable evidence suggests that she (Zellweger) did not dream of being on the silver screen from day one. Growing up in Katy, she was more jock than drama queen, running track and cross-country and playing basketball. When she left Katy to attend the University of Texas at Austin, she wanted to be a writer. As an English major, she says, I went all over the place, from Puritanism to British lit to the Victorians, to Hawthorne to Faulkner to name it. When she began to act at age twenty, it was to pay the bills; doing commercials for beer companies and fast-food restaurants may have been an unglamorous grind, especially with all the trips to Dallas to audition for parts she didn't get, but it was preferable to work-study or the lucrative but equally unglamorous time she spent as a waitress in the Austin topless bar Sugar's. She certainly has had an interesting path to stardom. Here she is the half-wit girlfriend of an ex-con, Gil Bellows as Watty Watts. Zellweger's character is Starlene Cheatham . One of Watty's ex-con friends is Rory Cochrane as Billy Mack Black , just about as weird a character as you will find.

This is not a good movie by any usual stretch of the imagination. Almost every scene has one crook or the other pointing a gun at someone's head, and everyone spouting foul language.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller"},{"date":"24 April 2013","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Rating A+With a great script, captivating plot, and accomplished actors, Ever After is an entertaining and highly enjoyable historical romance film. Given the medieval scenery and attire, the film pulls the audience directly into the bustle of the late eighteenth century. From sword fighting, romance, comedy, and drama, this film seemingly pulls all of these aspects together into one great film. Each time that I watch this movie, I feel connected to the main character Danielle, played by Drew Barrymore. Through each climatic scene where she faces set-backs and adversity I want her to succeed and find romance in the end. This film, and more specifically Barrymore's acting, has the ability to make the audience feel sad when Danielle is rejected by the prince in front of the entire kingdom or when she is sold off to pay her step mother's debt and happy when the prince saves her and asks for her forgiveness. Although the film is set in the eighteen century, it is easy to relate to Danielle, who despite hardships, has managed to make the most out of her seemingly horrible life. This film is a retelling of the fairy tale Cinderella. With evil step mothers and sisters, an extravagant ball, a pompous prince waiting to marry for love, and even with a glass slipper, the film aligns itself with the same occurrences of the classic fairytale. Noticing the cyclical nature of fairy tales and how they are often redone, it is important to take a look at the common theme between fairy tales and their remakes. In both the fairytale version and in the movie Ever After, the main theme that is shared is that evil behavior will have repercussions and that good will always prevail. In both of the films, the step mothers serve as an oppressive force to the main protagonist. However, in Ever After one of the step sisters helps Danielle, yet comes short of advocating against her mistreatment. Nonetheless, in both of the films, the main protagonist succeeds and finds love when truly all hope seems lost. The glass slipper is probably the most apparent similarity between the two films, which indicates the importance of the symbol. At the end of Ever After, Prince Henry played by Dougray Scott, after begging Danielle for forgiveness, kneels down and replaces the slipper Danielle lost at the ball. This also happened in the classic story. Yet in Ever After, Prince Henry rejected Danielle for falsely imposing as a countess. In the final scene, Prince Henry, after saving her from Pierre Le Pieu, a vile man who is taken with Danielle played by O'Brien, has to ask Danielle to forgive him for his past actions. Although the core message has transferred between the two films, there are differences. In Ever After, Danielle does not represent the typical female fairytale character waiting idly for the price to sweep her off of her feet. Danielle has read books and often times challenges Prince Henry about various topics. Her conviction astounds Prince Henry, who falls in love with her personality over her looks. They say that behind ever great leader, is a strong woman providing support, and that notion is clearly represented in the movie, as Danielle offers her ideas on how to improve the kingdom. Ever After offers the audience the possibility to escape into a new and exciting world, where true love always prevails and evil people are always punished. In contrast to the real world, Ever After offers the audience a chance to escape into a different time period and a new life where there is always a happy ending. ","genre":null},{"date":"24 April 2013","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Rating A+With a great script, captivating plot, and accomplished actors, Ever After is an entertaining and highly enjoyable historical romance film. Given the medieval scenery and attire, the film pulls the audience directly into the bustle of the late eighteenth century. From sword fighting, romance, comedy, and drama, this film seemingly pulls all of these aspects together into one great film. Each time that I watch this movie, I feel connected to the main character Danielle, played by Drew Barrymore. Through each climatic scene where she faces set-backs and adversity I want her to succeed and find romance in the end. This film, and more specifically Barrymore's acting, has the ability to make the audience feel sad when Danielle is rejected by the prince in front of the entire kingdom or when she is sold off to pay her step mother's debt and happy when the prince saves her and asks for her forgiveness. Although the film is set in the eighteen century, it is easy to relate to Danielle, who despite hardships, has managed to make the most out of her seemingly horrible life. This film is a retelling of the fairy tale Cinderella. With evil step mothers and sisters, an extravagant ball, a pompous prince waiting to marry for love, and even with a glass slipper, the film aligns itself with the same occurrences of the classic fairytale. Noticing the cyclical nature of fairy tales and how they are often redone, it is important to take a look at the common theme between fairy tales and their remakes. In both the fairytale version and in the movie Ever After, the main theme that is shared is that evil behavior will have repercussions and that good will always prevail. In both of the films, the step mothers serve as an oppressive force to the main protagonist. However, in Ever After one of the step sisters helps Danielle, yet comes short of advocating against her mistreatment. Nonetheless, in both of the films, the main protagonist succeeds and finds love when truly all hope seems lost. The glass slipper is probably the most apparent similarity between the two films, which indicates the importance of the symbol. At the end of Ever After, Prince Henry played by Dougray Scott, after begging Danielle for forgiveness, kneels down and replaces the slipper Danielle lost at the ball. This also happened in the classic story. Yet in Ever After, Prince Henry rejected Danielle for falsely imposing as a countess. In the final scene, Prince Henry, after saving her from Pierre Le Pieu, a vile man who is taken with Danielle played by O'Brien, has to ask Danielle to forgive him for his past actions. Although the core message has transferred between the two films, there are differences.
