Sleepy Hollow is the perfect kind of movie for his directional Midas touch; it resembles the best of Burton in every way. In the film, an adaptation based on a story by Washington Irving called The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, he captures the slumbering, creepy village of Sleepy Hollow with vivid details and imaginative description. The way everything is presented, the trees look like something out of a fairy tale and the scenery represents deception in a mysterious wonderland, is what makes this production one of the years most captivating and magical film experiences.\tSome of the visual credit should also be given to the film's Cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki, and the credited production designer, Rick Heinrichs. These elements contribute a great deal of success to Burton's masterpiece. Both the design and Cinematography are some of the best seen all year, and deserve a hard earned Oscar Nomination. They make the film intriguing and visually stimulating. \tThe film takes place in the late 1700's, in New York. Constable Ichabod Crane, a timid and but smart man played by Johnny Depp, is assigned to investigate a series of grizzly murders in a nearby town called Sleepy Hollow. He's rather concerned about his latest task, however, due to the content of the killings. The victim's heads have been sliced, in one clean sweep, straight from their bodies. He accepts his duties, and travels by horse and carriage to the isolated village. \tOnce Ichabod arrives, the locals, including Lady Van Tassel (Miranda Richardson), Baltus Van Tassel (Michael Gambon), Brom Van Brunt (Casper Van Dien), and Reverend Steenwyck (Jeffrey Jones), greet him with eagerness. They explain the legend of the headless horseman, who is supposedly causing the murders in their town. At first he is skeptical. Then, after witnessing a victim losing their head personally, he arrives at the conclusion that a headless horseman is responsible for the tragic catastrophes accruing. Ichabod soon meets Katrina Van Tassel, an innocent looking, self spoken young woman who may have some advice, as well as several secrets of her own.\tThe Headless horseman is a perfect portrayed villain for Sleepy Hollow. He is brute, oversized, and roughly textured with outwear. The actor who brings him to life when his head is on is perfect for the role; Christopher Walken. For some odd reason, however, popular film critic Roger Ebert reluctantly refused to tell his readers the name of the actor, thinking it would give something away. Well, I am sorry, Mr. Ebert, but it isn't that hard to find this information elsewhere. The filmmakers are not trying to hold Walken as a secret. Stating he stars as the headed horseman gives nothing away. One must see his performance and make up for themselves to even imagine what material the film's bad guy brings forth.\tTim Burton's direction is focused and wonderfully observant here. The murder sequences are gory and violent, but never way over the top. Burton never losses sight of his main characters, has a good idea about what he wants to place in film, and the special effects do not distract his ability to do so. He has a knack for allowing an audience to become involved with his pictures. We must think for ourselves, figuring out nuggets of the plot on our own, without the projectors help. He has demonstrated these techniques before in such films as Edward Scissorhands, The Nightmare Before Christmas, and even the best Batman film yet, Batman Returns. \tJohnny Depp offers an Oscar worthy performance as Ichabod Crane. He brings the squeamish role to life effortlessly with striking details and perfect form. He is flawlessly cast, as well as Christina Ricci, who also acts with style and poignancy. Compliments also go out to splendid costuming the actors are permitted to wear. \tAlthough Sleepy Hollow offers lots of creepy impressions, the film is far from being very scary. Some moments do generate some minor thrills, but for the most part, the production is not as terrifying as it could have been. Much of it lacks momentum and build-up for the dozen or so graphic beheadings that take place. Burton could have easily loaded his picture with bombarding amounts of shock value, suspense, and tension filled fright, but instead goes for all out violence, plot, and mystery. Not that this effects the overall production. This is more of an atmospheric movie than a scream feast. The atmosphere is certainly above the average. \tThe conclusion of Sleepy Hollow works in a bizarre, but unpredictable fashion. The climax occurs unexpectedly and excitingly, with much surprise and special effects. The film's foreshadowing is effective, but regardless of how experienced of a filmgoer you are, this is one ending that is not meant to be figured out before it takes place.

However, when The Fight Club first arrived in Spain, the reviews and critiques that it received in the press where extremely negative, perhaps the worst critiques i have ever heard towards a movie. This raised my curiosity substantially, and after watching the movie, I did agree with some of the things the critics had warned about.Nevertheless, I must say that the movie begins impressively, the analytical depiction of our western culture and the lifeless void that surrounds it, with some great touches of humour, is very impressive. One cannot help but to relate to the movie, because the emptiness under which Edward Norton's character lives is something that most people in our modern day societies can really identify with; it depicts a society in which materialism and consumerism are our only sources of pleasure, from which we get short-lived doses of excitement delivered from our material purchases. The director managed to display the most average man who had a normal job, flat, decoration, etc, someone who we could see as our equal, someone on our level. The familiarity one feels towards him should really be disturbing, yet it is not, mainly because after a re-count, he is a normal, integrated, productive member of our western society. He is what is hoped for and expected from all of us.The sad thing is that the director who started a movie, which I (up to that point) would have awarded 10 of 10, ended up delivering a movie, which I rated with a 4 of 10. The beginning is excellent, but half an hour into the movie or so, it is as if the director had introduced a completely different movie. From that point on it goes from bad to worse, and turning into another typical mindless Hollywood movie, with an unnecessary level of violence and a storyline which deteriorated by the minute and a precipitated ending that delivered nothing and just fouled those magnificent initial 30 minutes.

First, we have the over-achievers.  These are the students who constantly think of their individual futures, those that use the facade of caring about the image of their school being the best center of education in the world, the well being of the student body, and the professional careers of the facilty when, in fact, their minds are centered on receiving the best recommendations possible so as to be admitted to the best colleges on the road to making upwards to $125,000 a year with a minimum amount of work.  These are the students who, upon discovering that their high school does not have a school song, will take the evening to write a cheer.  Given a full night, they will write an opera.Next, there are the achievers.  These are the students with a sincere feeling of teamwork among the student body but also keep an eye on their individual futures.  They won't write the cheer (or opera), but will sing along with gusto at pep rallies.Following the achievers is (you guessed it), the under-achievers.  These are the students who could care less about their futures as individuals let alone the school.  Not only will they not write the cheer or sing it, but will take pride in publicly ridiculing anybody who does.  These students usually end up yelling Fries are up! by the age of 25.Finally, there are the stoners.  These are the students who have burnt out so bad they wander the hallways in a fog like the zombies from Night of the Living Dead, not quite sure where they are or what they're doing.  These students usually have to be nudged when the final bell of the day rings so they know it's time to go home.Election, based on the novel by Tom Perrotta, adapted for the screen by Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor III, and directed by Payne, captures the high school experience better than any John Hughs film of the 1980's.  Don't get me wrong-Ferris Bueller's Day Off and The Breakfast Club were excellent films.  But Election was so close to reality it brought me back to my own late '70's and early '80's high school days.Election focuses on the over-achiever, Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon), and the history\/civics teacher, Jim McAllister (Matthew Brodrick), who recognizes her for what she is the student who will stop at nothing to achieve that $125,000 a year job.  Motivated by his negative feelings for Flick, a crises in his own life, and revenge for an incident involving his best friend Dave Novotny (Mark Harelik) who was a teacher also, McAllister decides to gain revenge on student Flick using the student body presidential election.  I won't reveal what the incident was concerning Dave, but it is clear Tracy Flick is a stick, hell, a *bundle* of dynamite waiting to go off in the face of anyone who gets in her way.  What irritates McAllister most about Tracy Flick is her attitude of It's my way or the highway.Sucked into the whirlpool of McAllister and Flick's relationship is Paul Metzler (Chris Klein, in a role I could easily see Keanu Reeves playing 10 years ago), the well meaning, popular jock (an achiever) who has broken his leg in a skiing accident and needs a shot of self-esteem.  McAllister talks Paul into running for student body president against unopposed Flick. Further away from the revenge whirlpool but still an essential ingredient to unfolding events is Paul's adapted sister Tammy (Jessica Campbell), a young, under-achieving woman confused about her sexual orientation.  Tammy is severely emotionally hurt by a close girlfriend who she loves but does not respond in kind, and in fact is very unkind.  Downright mean, actually. The girlfriend is not lesbian and in an effort to reaffirm her own sexuality and hurt Tammy, she begins to date Paul.  Tammy, in an effort to hurt her and Paul, decides to run for student body president.  All of this comes as a surprise to Tracy Flick, who expected to run unopposed (and win by default).Reese Witherspoon is excellent as Tracy Flick.  She has a cute, radiant, affecting smile on the outside but has a drive and ambition with the weight of a steamroller on the inside.  When she purses her lips and squints her eyes in anger because something doesn't go her way, even the strongest of the strong get a shiver up the spine.  Matthew Brodrick is great as Jim McAllister, a good man with a simple way of looking at life (held in secret contempt by Tracy) who ends up making one or two bad judgment calls.The script is dark humored, extremely funny, and insightful.  Jim, speaking of his best friend Dave, remarks He became a high school teacher because he's one of those people who never wanted to leave high school in the first place.  The characters have depth and are complex.  I was also impressed by how the school facility was handled by the script.  They do not come off like clueless adults who are one step behind the students (as in most other high school films).  Rather, they are intelligent and mature, as demonstrated by Vice Principle Ron Bell (Matt Malloy).Payne's direction is stylish and he has a wonderful grasp on the narrative. He is very creative with the camera and exploits the visual, using freeze frames at key moments of character introduction with brief voice over narration, cutting to events in the past and returning to the original freeze frame when the intro is over.  Payne also uses the freeze frame technique at key plot moments like a writer uses an exclamation point.Election is an examination of what's really important in life.  In some ways, it reminded me of the high school version of American Beauty. Overall, Election is as sharp and real as they come.

In fact he's a decent and intelligent man, by no means a weak leader, and his relationship with Dmitri (the Russian general secretary) is almost touching - not that any of this helps him very much.I've noticed that a number of people who say they aren't fond of Kubrick in general make an exception for this film.  I can see why - even though I AM fond of Kubrick in general.

Bruce Willis was not very good, I think we're all tired of watching him save the world or a city or whatever. Liv Taylor is not the best actress around, but then her part didn't demand much, so I guess she did alright. Ben Affleck was nothing special.

Growing up in New York State, it was almost required reading as a New York citizen, especially at Halloween time.  The story was chilling and creepy, with deep dark lonely woods inhabited by a ghostly colonial headless horseman.  So when I heard Tim Burton (a very stylish director, the current master of film gothic) was adapting the story for the screen, I was looking forward to seeing the finished product.  I was not disappointed.  Sleepy Hollow, written by Kevin Yagher and Andrew Kevin Walker (Se7en) delivers.  Although some story elements have been changed from the original (Ichabod Crane is now a New York City constable rather than a school teacher), the creeps are still here.  Director Tim Burton has fashioned a small town in 1799 upstate New York into a place straight out of a gothic fairy tale but still seems believable.  There is copious amounts of fog and one can almost see the colonial stone and wood buildings leaning at an angle like drawings from a book of fables.  The set design is fantastic.Johnny Depp, as progressive constable Ichabod Crane (he believes in a scientific approach to crime solving), confident in his largely untried methods to solve any homicide but handicapped by his underlying fear of the unknown, is powerful.  As he demonstrated in Ed Wood, Depp is an actor to be reckoned with, displaying great emotionality when fighting his own fearful past.  Christina Ricci, as Katrina Van Tassel, has come a long way from Casper.  She has developed into a competent actor who exudes the repressed sexuality demanded by her role, creating tension between herself and Depp's Crane.   Miranda Richardson wonderfully immerses herself in the role of Lady Van Tassel, a character with several faces.  And Christopher Walken, as the Hessian (soon to be) Headless Horseman, proves he can dominate the screen even when his character has not one word to say.  His facial expressions and body language alone is frightening.       The music, by former Oingo Boingo band member Danny Elfman (his origins will always be remembered by those of us who were in our mid 20's during the 1980's) is as rich and haunting as any film music he has composed in the past.  He stands with John Williams, Jerry Goldsmith and James Horner as one of the best film music composers in Hollywood.  I personally consider his best work to be the soundtrack for Batman, and he has equaled this with his music for Sleepy Hollow.If there is any flaw in Sleepy Hollow, it is the intrigue and conspiracy surrounding a last will and testament.  The criminal act involved with this brought the film out of the supernatural (where it works best) and down to reality (where the film should never have been).  Although this element is essential to the plot, thankfully it is briefly touched on and we are quickly returned to the chills of the netherworld.Sleepy Hollow is great entertainment, a much better made film and much more chilling than The Blair Witch Project ever hoped to be.  Although not perfect, Sleepy Hollow is a solid film.

That's basically it for a plot.My Critique It's unfortunate that one of the largest grossing films of all time also happens to be one of the stupidest. ID4 is perhaps the granddaddy of all bad science fiction\/special effects movies in the blockbuster-driven 1990's. It has it all, as far as blockbuster go. ID4 has no real story. Aliens come to Earth and blow up things. Earth (or rather America) fights back. More things blow up. Between things blowing up, we have pitiful attempts at filler, such as a stripper saving the First Lady.The screenwriters opted for minimal character development. The Characters don't actually have much to do with the story, they're just there to yell stupid one-liners and No!!!! whenever something blows up.In place of story, special effects are used. To me, the special effects in ID4 aren't even good. In the entire movie, we only see one alien. The Oscar winning special effects are mainly of explosions and ugly, gray, alien destroyers, which all look the same to me.But perhaps the main thing ID4 lacks is a message. When I say message, I don't mean a moral lesson. Instead, I mean that the movie doesn't have a point it's trying to make. All great science fiction, and most movies in general, have a point to them. In 2001  A Space Odyssey, the point was that man cannot rely on computers. In The Day the Earth Stood Still, aliens were coming to destroy Earth, like the ones in ID4. However in The Day the Earth Stood Still, the aliens were trying to teach humans a lesson about nuclear war, as was the point in many sci-fi movies from the 1950's. In ID4, though, aliens simply want to destroy humans. They have no motivation for carnage.It's a true shame that a movie as stupid, thoughtless, and flashy as Independence Day is one of the highest grossing movies of all time.My Rating  3  ","genre":null},{"date":"16 December 1999","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":"  The Plot Predatory aliens are coming to destroy Earth and it's up to Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum, Lord help us, to save the planet.

I honestly did not believe that Mike Myers could stoop so low as to use such crude, primal bathroom humor. The film lacked the spontaneous gags and spunk of International Man of Mystery. Where were the 60s spy movie in-jokes (aside from the bad puns and Mini-Me in the baby carriage)? Where were the clever double entendres? Where was the magic? The Spy Who Shagged Me could have been much more entertaining if a few amendments had been made.First, the writers should have cashed in on the Star Wars cow. The film opened with golden credits flying through space and made mention of a Death Star, but it missed the train. Even Austin's mojo could have been portrayed as more mystical and drug-like instead of a pink potion. Second, Fat Bastard should never have existed. His comments belong in a men's locker room, NOT in a motion picture. I literally felt nauseous as he described his bathroom practices. Third, what happened to the 60s Dr. Evil? Was he frozen too? Wouldn't his staff have questioned a 90s Dr. Evil returning to the 60s and taking over? And why did Evil have to sleep with Frau what's her bucket? He always complained about Scott's lack of evil tendencies, calling him the Diet Coke of evil. Why couldn't he just not sleep with her and fail to produce Scott at all? Then he would only have Mini Me and be content.Aside from the those amendments, the film was not entirely awful. I enjoyed the irony of Scott being more evil than his father. Scott is the one who lampoons the idiocy of throwing Austin and Felicity in a jail cell with one guard. Scott is the one who recommends killing Austin in the past, and his father replies that Scott does not truly understand the nature of evil. I think that if Scott were Dr. Evil, things would be happening in a more practical manner. I enjoyed the random nature of One of Us as performed by Dr. Evil. The whole rap number with Mini Me was hilarious as well. Yet I think that the film seemed to go off on an enormous tangent once Austin lost his mojo. The whole sequence with the phallic-shaped ship was incredibly bizarre. It had the flavor of an SNL episode. All in all, this film needed some clarification and some non-bathroom related humor. If the third installment in the trilogy returns to the flavor of International Man of Mystery, it will be a good film. I'll keep my fingers crossed.

When the hatches on the landing boats open, bodies are literally torn apart by high calibre machine gun bullets.  Booming explosions, agonizing screams, the whine of bullets richocheting.  At the conclusion of the initial battle, all that remains is a sea of blood washing ashore.  It is immersive and I for one was left speechless and literally shaking.Some have criticised the acting, in particular the relative 'unknowns' in the supporting cast, but I believe such criticisms are harsh.  The quality of the supporting cast, with Tom Sizemore and Ed Burns, plus a cameo by Ted Danson combined to make the acting quite good.  Tom Hanks, as always, was Oscar-worthy, portraying the huge burden of an ordinary English teacher leading men into battle, knowing many men under his command will not be going home.SPR is definitely the best 'war' film, and one of the best films period.  The very least you should get out of Saving Private Ryan is an appreciation of war and what those men experienced in trying to protect the world's freedom.  Lest We Forget.
