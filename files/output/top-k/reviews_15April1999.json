[{"date":"15 April 1999","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Robert Altman's films are always a gamble.  Either you get the focused Altman of `The Player', `M.A.S.H', or `Short Cuts', or you get the dreadful Altman of `Ready To Wear' and `Kansas City'.  What `Cookie's Fortune' reveals is a kind-hearted Altman. An Altman who wants to be a little silly and yet shows us his typical array of colorful characters. As with all the director's films, it's the actors that sell the movie best.  Like the aforementioned Andy Garcia, Charles Dutton is another actor of far-reaching talent that keeps picking crap to spend it in. With `Cookie', Dutton is used perfectly.  He brings a sweetness and gentle charm to the role, and with co-star Liv Tyler (also as good) the two share the best moments of the film. Glenn Close, Julianne Moore, Ned Beatty (who is hysterical), and - God help me - Chris O'Donnell all make such a wonderful collection of performances. I really enjoyed just watching these people.When the story kicks up, my interest waned a bit.  The end of the movie is this mosh pit of names being thrown around, it is all very disorienting.  It's mutes the film's final impact, which up till then was fairly solid. Basically it was just neat to sit and watch this simple story unfold in a wonderful location, and with a ensemble that knows how to have a little fun. After `Gingerbread Man' I was a bit worried that Altman was going to become a parody of himself. But if this is the new Robert Altman, I welcome the change.------------ 8 ","genre":null},{"date":"15 April 1999","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Robert Altman's films are always a gamble.

This is a gentle way of saying that this is a dumb movie that may be confused for being important.You no doubt know the story by now siblings get sucked into a 50s-era black-and-white television series called Pleasantville. Much hilariousness follows. (And important, weighty social lessons, too!)At least that is what Gary Ross, the auteur behind this mess, would like you to believe. In truth, whatever comedy could've been wrested from the fishes-out-of-water premise was all milked perfectly by Back to the Future over a decade ago. In retrospect, Back to the Future seems a smarter social commentary, too, even as it is also an exponentially more entertaining story, with memorable, endearing (and enduring) characters.But I digress. We were speaking of Pleasantville.Tiresome and hypocritical, the film makes its strongest case against simple-minded moralizing by being the embodiment of that which it indicts. It is a irony beyond explanation that a film can so closemindedly assert and repeat ad nauseum, open your mind. To what, exactly, you ask? Well, anything, really. Promiscuity, changing your routines, a new job, masturbation, racial equality, unleashing your inner artist, all sorts of important STUFF. Why, you inquire? Because if you don't, you are a 1) A Nazi 2) A Repressed Zombie, or 3) a VERY WHITE MALE.If you think there must be more to Pleasantville than Gary Ross finding a variety of challenging ways to insult your intelligence, you're right. There are a lot of very boring storylines involving utterly uninteresting characters that evolve slower than mankind. You will be amazed, by the story's end, at just how little you cared about anyone in the film.Much like its theologically-retarded sibling, What Dreams May Come, Pleasantville is SUPERBLY acted, and BEAUTIFULLY shot. The failure of both films lies solely in the clumsy, ham-handed storytelling.Rather than watch this two-hour bumpersticker, do yourself a favor and rent a few superior films with complimentary themes1) Woody Allen's spectacular The Purple Rose of Cairo, 2) Robert Zemekis' Back to the Future, 3) Woody Allen's Crimes and MisdemeanorsI know this review isn't exactly a well written criticism, but by this point, I'm sure you understand why.

HA HA HA HA HA only joking, this is a pretty good film actually and if only the stars Robert Shaw or Richard Dreyfuss were starring in this, this might have been a very worthy sequel. There are some good parts in this film,the death of the divers at the beginning was good,but......on 3 of the deaths there was not a single trace of blood......what was there a corn syrup famine in 1978 or something? There was a really fake part in which the shark is about to eat Michael Brody ,as Brody is saved the sharks mouth bends into a weird shape, showing that it IS made of rubber. Also at the beginning when two divers find the Orca the ship is lying on its right side , with the left side showing up, the left side has not been damaged at all, and the glass is still in tact, but....after the first shark killed Quint, did not it smash through the left side to get to Brody ????This is the second best Jaws film out of the 4, possibly soon to be 5. Jaws is the best by far,Jaws 2 is a worthy sequel....just, Jaws 3 is crap but better than the worst film that I have possibly seen Jaws the Revenge.Jaws 2, like I said needed the presence of Robert Shaw or Richard Dreyfuss. note* Robert Shaw`s character of Quint was killed in Jaws so it was impossible to recast him, unless he was super fisherman.All in all I will give this film a 5 and a half out of 10, because of the recast of 6 of the originals. Let's just hope if there is a Jaws 5 that it will be a sequel better than the original.THE girl who plays Jackie is a good competition for Jamie Lee Curtis as Scream Queen.
