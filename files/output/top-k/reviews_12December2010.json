The film takes place in modern day San Francisco.Nicholas Van Orten (Douglas) is a very successful business man who lives alone and is very depressed. He used to be married and does not have a very close relationship with his brother, Conrad (Penn). On Nicholas's birthday he remembers how his father killed himself when he turned forty eight. But on Nicholas's birthday his brother gives him a gift that is from a company known as Consumer Recreation Services (CRS). What this company provides is a game that will control your life and promises a thrilling experience that you've never felt before. But it gets a little bit too thrilling...John D. Brancato and Michael Ferris wrote the screenplay for this psychological thriller, and it was a little bit too outrageous. It still is a very fun and entertaining ride but it requires you to not think too deeply about what the company needs to be doing for all of this to be happening. I will not go over all the ridiculous things that happen that make this film illogical because there are too many to count, but like I said if you forget about them it is a fun film. Also, this film is purely plot driven, the characters are very one dimensional. In all psychological thrillers there is some sort of twist and in this one there are many as well and they are satisfying, especially the final one. David Fincher is one of the biggest directors of today but this film was only his third feature and it did not have as much intensity and grittiness as his previous film Se7en. None of the shots in this film were all that impressive, but the sequencing of the shots kept me fascinated the whole way through the film. Fincher grew much as a director since this film and I would even claim that he is one of the best of his generation. But this film is not the reason why he is considered that at all, he became a cult favorite from Se7en and Fight Club then went on to start making more wide spread audience films like Zodiac, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, and the recent The Social Network. His film repertoire is very impressive and it is enjoyable to see one of his early works such as this film and see how he has grown from it.Michael Douglas plays the lead of Nicholas Van Orten and even though the character is one dimensional he embodies the role quite well. He sort of plays a sad Gordon Gekko but does not have the great lines that Gekko had. He was very believable in the role but again this is not something that he will be remembered for when talking about why Michael Douglas is a very successful actor.Sean Penn does not have a major part in this film but he is still in it for a little bit as Nicholas's brother Conrad. When Nicholas and Conrad are running from the CRS and Conrad has sort of a paranoid nervous breakdown Penn is quite good, even though it is nothing compared to the many brilliant performances of his career. When I think Sean Penn I think Milk, Mystic River, and his comedic performance in Fast Times at Ridgemont High, not this film even though he is good, like Douglas.Deborah Kara Unger plays a waitress named Christine that Nicholas drags into his game. As the film goes on it is hard to determine if she is trying to help Nicholas or if she is working with the CRS. Her performance is alright, but nothing really memorable. I can't even cite a scene in the movie where she was good, it was just her character that was interesting.Overall I give this film a 6\/10, because it is a thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the dramatic finale. None of the qualities of the film are great, but they are all decent. I would recommend this to fans of Fincher, psychological thrillers, or I guess dark films with a twist.

After lots of perfection to his aptly named telepods, Brundle decides to teleport himself from one pod to the other. During the process a fly gets into the telepod with him and his DNA is fused with it. He slowly begins to transform into a horrible human\/fly hybrid which he names Brundlefly. The transformation is horrific and grotesque, but the movie is overall pretty cool.There isn't a whole lot going on with this film and there are only three main characters. The story is straightforward but still interesting to watch unfold. There are some side stories that seem kind of useless but they're never overbearing. Goldblum's transformation, physical and mental, is really neat to watch and the movie is definitely entertaining from start to finish. The majority of the sci fi films coming from the 70's and 80's were fairly simplistic but spawned a lot of science fiction themes for the future. The Fly definitely started out an interest in the grotesque human transformations we've seen in a lot of movies dealing with genetic manipulation, so in that respect The Fly is unforgettable. And it's not to say that there isn't enough going on in The Fly, because anymore and it would have been bloated and a lot of the focus of the film, which is solely on Brundle's transformation and how it is affecting the limited cast around him, would have been scattered. As far as storyline goes there isn't much I can complain about.However, from a character standpoint I did have a couple issues with The Fly. Like I said before, the movie only has three characters. The rest of the cast, which is literally seven other people, are characters with no names or one or two speaking lines. Goldblum, Davis, and Getz aren't bad by any means, but I didn't feel like any of them had the force necessary to drive the film. They all seemed too weak and it made me feel like the film was lacking a dominant character. The film looks and feels very Hollywood, but it lacks the A-list stars to flesh out that feeling. The three leads I felt like belonged in supporting roles, when they were all three important leads. But after some getting use to, they carried the film to the end well enough.Of course the film wouldn't have kept my interest nearly as well if not for the great makeup job done on Jeff Goldblum as he turned into the gruesome Brundlefly. His transformation is a disgustingly awesome feat in sci-fi creature design. It's probably the aspect of the film with the highest quality, which is fitting for a movie that is all about that particular aspect, even in its title. A warning to anyone with a weak stomach though, Brundlefly is one of the most grotesque and disgusting things I have ever seen in a movie. He is so horribly deformed and disgusting that I get a little queasy thinking about the final horrific scenes of the film. Everything this creature does is eyeopening disgusting and if I didn't find these kinds of grotesque effects awesome I would have probably hated this movie for being ridiculously gross and vomit inducing. But amidst all my twitching and wincing at how gross this film was, I really enjoyed it for taking such a disgusting risk.The Fly is a lot of fun overall. It's got some kinks, but I can forgive them for the last thirty minutes of the film which are disgusting and yet jaw droppingly awesome. This movie is a worthwhile watch, especially if you're into some classic sci-fi.

This place is very boring and mechanistic until the arrival of new life into the institution in the form of McMurphy played by Jack Nicholson, a convict who had plead insanity to keep him from staying in prison. Although this place had run very smooth and on cue at all points for several years, McMurphy's change was immediate. Even eventual electric shock cannot ever take his laughter and sense of adventure while veering from the disciplines of the instilled rules help to show a character whose life and spirit away.As a supporting character, Danny Devi to plays Martini. This character is as demented as they come with major sexual issues and lack of any common sense understanding. McMurphy's willingness and want for normalcy reaches to his deep rooted feelings for fun, laughter and mischievous behavior. In the scenes where he starts, teaches and regulates gambling and basketball and other sports, he has total disregard for himself and trouble as soon he realizes that he is making a difference in these men's lives.McMurphy made significant improvements to these men's lives. When The Chief, played by Will Sampson spoke for the first time it was both shocking and moving. This was a man that had been revived after acting as a small shy boy in a very large mans body. Assisting Billy Bibbit in getting rid of his stutter was the by - product of trying to help him bust out of his shell after years of ridicule and torment over his speech impediment. In true form nurse Ratched played by Louise Fletcher, lashes out at Billy causing him to take his own life. This I believe is symbolic as it shows that Billy went out with a fight however could not overcome his meager brain and issues. Although McMurphy's original intention was self centered you truly see him attempting to help others help themselves and eventually pay the ultimate price for his actions. The look on his face as The Chief smothers him to his death signifies both ultimate accomplishments as he had changed these men forever. This was by far the best scene as The Chief lifts the too heavy for anyone control panel and throws it out of the window allowing him to escape to freedom.I believe a comparable film would be Full Metal Jacket, this is another movie with characters looking to bust our of age &#x96; old discipline.

Forget the awful sequels, this is the one to see and own. The original is a true classic and truly timeless. Like Port wine, gets better with time.Knowing it's a foreign movie (German in this case) only makes it feel even more special and distinguish than it already is. I am not even a fan of many fantasy movies, but this one is fantastic. More than just a movie, it's like a miracle come true and it takes us to a wonderful world of fantasy, a world of make-believe, a land of dreams and magic.Cinematography is spectacular, with dazzling landscapes and settings. Special effects are fascinating. Sounds are awesome. The movie is not purely artistic, there is a story behind the art of this creation. A very interesting and deep story, an emotional quest. This film is epic.For a fantasy tale it is surprisingly short. But hey, why do all fantasy movies have to be more than 2 hours or nearly 3 hours long anyway? During its short length it offers a lot more than most fantasy movies do in a much longer length. Its pace is flawless but fast... or maybe the film is just so good that it ends fast, way too fast, leaving the wish for more.This amazing film is a cinematic masterpiece and one of the finest ever, very worthy of belonging to any good movie collection.The soundtrack by Giorgio Moroder and Klaus Doldinger is pure genius. The entire score is instrumental aside Limahl's lovely song Never Ending Story. The rest of the soundtrack appeals to the senses. Some of it sounds so sad and emotional that it causes eyes to get teary. Some of it, such as the Southern Oracle's Theme and the Sphinxes's Theme, sounds and feels so deep, intense and creepy that it sends chills down the spine. Some of it sounds so happy that it puts a smile on your face.Atreyu is my hero. He is nice, cool, very brave and determined, has charisma and his long hair is phenomenal. Bastian is cute, nice, adorable, shy, innocent. The Childlike Empress is so expressive in every way despite her very short role. The luckdragon Falkor is a gentle giant, very friendly and endearing. And he is so cute, looks like a giant plush. Makes me wanna pet him and cuddle him. The gnomes Engywook and Urgl are hilarious. Their eccentric appearance and weird voices alone would be enough to make them comical, but it's whenever they argue with each other that they are really funny. Gmork is a fabulous villain, but very frightening. His terrifying figure combined with his powerful voice makes a scary combination.Noah Hathaway is super as the great little warrior Atreyu. Barret Oliver is amazing as Bastian. Tami Stronach is impeccable as the Childlike Empress. In other words, a perfect cast.This gem exists in two versions the English language version and the German dubbed version. Normally I can't stand dubbed versions but in this case I really like it. Even in German language, it still is perfect. It's the same movie anyway, just with some differences. And in certain scenes it improves even more the perfection of the version in English.As I was saying, there are a few differences between both versions. For example, some different names, some different music and some of the same music but not played in the same sequences, some additional scenes (which means slightly longer takes in certain sequences), completely different opening credits and opening music (in the German version it is entirely black screen, without those pink clouds and the music is instrumental and more intense), completely different music in the final credits (but not the same one as in the opening credits unlike the English version) and the soundtrack is entirely by Klaus Doldinger, without any by Giorgio Moroder. It is 7 minutes longer but it doesn't seem so. In fact, I hardly even notice the extra-length. Both versions are very worth owning! Surprisingly the German language and dubbing do not ruin its charm, even though (admittedly) it doesn't sound as authentic in German because it's the same people but not in their real voices. I don't know who dubbed the voices for the actors, but whoever they are they did a great job, regardless of the missing authenticness.Another surprise is that in some cases the voices are almost identical to the original actors's. For example, the voices of Falkor and Engywook sound almost the same. Kinda makes me wonder if they were dubbed by the same actors, but I don't think they were. Bastian's voice is somewhat similar to Barret Oliver's, only less baby-like. Atreyu's voice sounds clearly more childish (a contrast with Noah Hathaway's mature voice), but that's not a problem to me, it's no less charming for that matter.Even without English subtitles I don't mind. I know the English version so well that I practically know all the lines, plus I know and understand a bit of German (if very little).Title in Portugal 'História Interminável'.

But since this movie is so famous and so highly regarded, and since I found it to be such a mediocre film, I had to voice my opinion. If you're like me, you'll want to skip this movie.After years of putting it off, I finally saw this movie the other day. I could not believe that what I saw is considered a classic and a must see film. OK, so I know it has some pretty good lines and scenes, and it has some iconic actors, and the screenwriter has a pretty impressive list of films he's done before. But there's a lot more to making a good movie than just having famous people work on it. And in my opinion, this is a very boring movie.Whenever I watch a movie that I consider boring, it's usually because I don't care about the characters or the story, and when that happens, it's the screenwriter's fault. William Goldman wrote one of my favorite movies, the Princess Bride. That had a great story and some really great characters. And for the most part, it was done with relatively unknown actors.This film, however, had some very famous actors and was about some very famous actual historical characters. I love stories about the Old West, and I really should have enjoyed this movie. Instead, it was very hard for me to watch this film. I fast-forwarded through many parts of it just to finally get through it.The raindrops scene with Newman and Ross on a bicycle was completely out of place. How does a late 1960's pop song have anything at all to do with Butch Cassidy? This scene is horrible. It added absolutely nothing at all to the film. We already know Katharine Ross's character has relationships with both of the title characters. The bicycle scene was totally unnecessary, and I can't imagine why that wasn't cut out of the movie entirely. Even if you watch it on 2X, you'll still waste 5 minutes waiting for the scene to end.There's another scene when they're traveling to Bolivia. This takes forever as well. Do we really need to see the sepia-toned pictures of these actors making their way down to Bolivia? I don't think so. It certainly doesn't have to be as long as it was, either. I hate it when screenwriters don't give the audience enough credit. We all know how far away Bolivia is. We don't need to see 12 minutes of footage to know it took a really long time for them to make it there.Finally, a word about the acting. Newman, Redford and Ross have done some great work in other movies. In this one, though, I'm not sure they were necessary at all. Just about anyone could have done just as well as they did. I didn't see any reason at all that they were needed for this film to work.My advice to you is to skip this movie. It is terribly overrated.

And for the most part, it was done with relatively unknown actors.This film, however, had some very famous actors and was about some very famous actual historical characters. I love stories about the Old West, and I really should have enjoyed this movie. Instead, it was very hard for me to watch this film. I fast-forwarded through many parts of it just to finally get through it.The raindrops scene with Newman and Ross on a bicycle was completely out of place. How does a late 1960's pop song have anything at all to do with Butch Cassidy? This scene is horrible. It added absolutely nothing at all to the film. We already know Katharine Ross's character has relationships with both of the title characters. The bicycle scene was totally unnecessary, and I can't imagine why that wasn't cut out of the movie entirely. Even if you watch it on 2X, you'll still waste 5 minutes waiting for the scene to end.There's another scene when they're traveling to Bolivia. This takes forever as well. Do we really need to see the sepia-toned pictures of these actors making their way down to Bolivia? I don't think so. It certainly doesn't have to be as long as it was, either. I hate it when screenwriters don't give the audience enough credit. We all know how far away Bolivia is. We don't need to see 12 minutes of footage to know it took a really long time for them to make it there.Finally, a word about the acting. Newman, Redford and Ross have done some great work in other movies. In this one, though, I'm not sure they were necessary at all. Just about anyone could have done just as well as they did. I didn't see any reason at all that they were needed for this film to work.My advice to you is to skip this movie. It is terribly overrated.

I could not believe that what I saw is considered a classic and a must see film. OK, so I know it has some pretty good lines and scenes, and it has some iconic actors, and the screenwriter has a pretty impressive list of films he's done before.

He is walking barefoot and wearing a vest all through the film and saying a phrase in the film that has become world-famous. This is macho exemplified. Talk about action and it has to be a John McTiernan film, right? The legendary director of the film Predator (1987) starring Arnold Schwarzenegger yet again scores a hit.Plot? Who needs a plot in an action flick? On the other hand a good plot surely helps an action film, and this film is no exception.
