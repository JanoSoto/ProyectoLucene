Whether or not you want to take the trip with him depends on what you bring to the table with your own taste and personal histories.In fact, personal histories is what this film is all about. It's a grand guignol soap opera, the interweaving storylines and intersecting characters, the dying patriarchs and the drug abuse and marital infidelity. But it's all self-reflexive. At one point, the old man's nurse ( ) tells a phone operator, This is like one of those scenes in a movie where the dying old man makes his last request to see his son. But it's real. Except it isn't.There's so much going on in this film that it seems obviously written by a former film student, someone who knows how critics like symbolism and layers. It's destined for cult status. Every scene packs some sort of dramatic wallop. Like it or not, this film attempts something very few other American films have it lets the scenes go on until a character says their piece and reveals a little bit more of who they are. It's bravely not in a rush.I can criticize a lot of little things - which enervate the people who dislike this film - but they for me are overshadowed by what it attempts and what it accomplishes. Just as with Boogie Nights the film's too long. Anderson seems so sure that every thing he puts up there will be interesting to everyone else without bothering to rethink it. It's like a bloated novel by a brilliant writer (like, say Don DeLillo's Underworld), wherein you want to skip over certain parts where the writer gets carried away with their own brilliance and the depth and breadth of what they are attempting. The film could also be criticized for falling prey to what I call Spike Lee Syndrome - incessant use of the music soundtrack overlayed over long sequences to string them together; here sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. It's as if the filmmaker is insecure about the ability of their dialogue to carry a scene or sequence, but music can drown out and then blunt much of the emotional impact. The film could also benefit from more humor - there's some, coming naturally from the human situations and dark comedy moments - but not enough to give the audience a breather for such long emotional stretches.And yet this is still an astonishing piece of work. To weave so many lives together, to bring together such an amazing cast and illicit a string of superb performances, is not an easy task, and, in this day and age, it's a rare Hollywood film that actually is about something. To criticize the film for not having enough plot seems narrowminded, ie, revealing how much people have become accustomed to the Plot Point every 5 minutes film structure. This film is highly structured, it's rarely boring, and at the end it reaches a catharsis, an epiphany even (replete with Biblical imagery, either laughable or mind-blowing depending on your point of view, but undeniably a major surprise - an event, which by the way, really did happen). Particularly outstanding are Jason Robards, in that most thankless of roles, stuck on a deathbed for the entirety of the film; he nonetheless brings to it an enormous amount of pathos. Phillip Baker Hall (the gameshow host) and John Reilly (the cop), who have both been in Anderson's two other films, are also excellent. Reilly's may in fact be one of the most realistic and humanistic portrayals of a police officer in film history. Tom Cruise, the misogynistic male empowerment guru, is quite remarkable (although some cynics would merely say he's playing himself) - although it's hard to watch all of his scenes preaching to the whooping throngs of males awaiting advice on how to bag babes. (What's scary is it isn't all that farfetched to imagine this really happening.) The child actors are frighteningly good (particularly the lead child prodigy boy). Although the women are excellent I still get the feeling that Anderson is less comfortable developing and understanding female characters. (Here at least, he has a wonderful African American TV interviewer, a woman who cuts through the Cruise's BS with acute sharpness.)Although Anderson's direction is occasionally too overexuberant, overall it's beautifully filmed and orchestrated, from the lighting and composition right down to the small background touches (the artwork on the walls, the furniture, the background players even). The recurring themes and symbols make this a film to go back and watch a second time (when you have another three hours to kill, of course). Especially big is the theme of power, inherent in each scene, wherein one character has power over the other, forcing them to sit down, to be quiet, to listen. It's a thought-provoking film, open to debate and interpretation, full of life (and death), of black comedy, and in the hands of a less-ambitious director the same film could easily have been reduced to a MOW (which, one of the child prodigies in the film criticizes another for not knowing , means Movie of the Week). Criticizing it for not being more short and sweet, like a typical movie, is to forget that it's not a movie at all, but a Film with a capital F - and all the pretensions which go along with that. Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky made films unlike any other, sometimes entertaining but more often difficult and philosophical. Anderson's no Tarkovsky, but he may be as close as (mainstream) Hollywood will allow themselves to get. And if people don't want to sit through Magnolia there's always the James Bond film playing next door. Just remember there's room for all of them.

This is an exaggeration, of course still, the fate of one of Solondz's resident perverts, a pedophile psychologist ,inspires the very feelings Aristotle himself prescribed to Tragedy pity and fear. The other characters are pathetic in their own individual ways no age group or gender is overlooked. Some of the plot developments are indeed so disturbing that even the most desensitized members of the audience cannot help but cringe; after the first ten minutes, it's impossible to remain unaffected. Yes, Happiness can be an amazing experience,but even with all of its emotional arsenal,the movie is no masterpiece. The director is overly preoccupied with sheer contextual impact, or shock value, and seems to neglect some other cinematic ingredients. Esthetically, the film needs to be more concisely structured and better edited, to maintain its momentum. The storylines are intersected at random, not with the brilliant logic of Pulp Fiction. This frequent cutting and pasting becomes confusing and the picture often looses its focus. Some scenes are unnecessarily lengthy, their excessive pauses lessening the immediate visceral effect. Perhaps, if Solondz went back to the editing room and tightened things up a bit, he would have produced a 10. Regardless of its considerable flaws, Happiness is a movie for our times. Anyone who has ever felt rejected, lonely, trapped, or overwhelmed by powerful instincts should find much in common with its losers.

No, not like we use to see, the same story being told by three different points of view, or ways. In Lola rennt, basically, the stories are the same Lola have to find $ 100000,00 or her boyfriend will be killed so, she runs to her father's bank. These are the points in common. In each one of them, the end is different, what happen to Lola's father (you'll understand if you watch the movie) is different, the way Lola get (or not) the money is different, what happen to the people that crossed Lola is different... Lola rennt is different! It's different from everything that you've watched in your life. And watching it is a very different (and good) experience. ","genre":"Crime, Drama"}]
