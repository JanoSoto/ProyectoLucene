It's easy to see why because there's no question that it's one of the most raw, violent and frightening films ever made. Director John McNaughton was given money to create a horror movie but he instead created something totally original and shocking. It's been noted that this wasn't the type of horror film the money men were expecting and this reminds me of when Peter Bogdanovich was given money to create a cheap horror film and instead he went and made TARGETS, another chilling movie about a deranged mind.This film here benefits from some great acting and technical brilliance and it's rather amazing what everyone was able to pull off in just 28-days on a very small budget. I think the greatest thing going for the picture is the way McNaughton makes it just so raw and powerful. By the time this film was released we were already used to violence but there was something different here. This wasn't a masked psycho running around and slaughtering teens at a camp site. This here was something more personal and the fact that a guy like Henry could be stalking you just made it all the more creepy. The film has some terrific camera- work but also an incredibly haunting music score that perfectly plays over the aftermath of some of the murders. Another major plus are the three performances, which are just marvelous with Rooker perfectly capturing the mind frame of this deranged man. It's really amazing to see Rooker work as you really do feel as if you're watching a real character. There's never a false note in his performance. He could be acting out this violence or struggling with his relationship to the third character in the film. Just take a look at the sequence where he talks about the abuse he received from his mother. Towles is also terrific as his character is just as deranged in his own right. The actor manages to make you feel uneasy whenever Otis is on the screen and especially with his appetite towards his sister. In the role of the sister, Tracy Arnold often gets overlooked but she's the perfect centerpiece of sadness that gets mixed up in all the horror and violence. Most people won't be able to relate to Henry or Otis but the sadness of the sister's character is someone viewer's probably know.What really separates this film is the controversial violence, which originally got the film a X-rating. There's no question that the added sound effects really push home the violence and what we see here is something that often crosses the line. Whereas in horror movies of the era where we cheer for the killers and the violence, the death scenes here are something far more horrific and especially the now infamous home invasion sequence. This scene alone is without question one of the most disturbing moments in film history and manages to make you sick at your stomach no matter how many times you've seen the film. HENRY PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER is without question one of the best of its type. It's not a movie that you can really enjoy because of how dark, disturbing and at times sad it is. The movie is a prime example of a low-budget movie where the director and cast could have just mailed something in but instead they went the extra mile and tried to do something fresh and original. This movie will certainly live on because of this and it remains one of the most raw and brutal films ever made.

I'm really not sure how to rate this film because on one hand it's an incredibly entertaining police drama that gets your blood boiling at the opening shot and it just gets hotter and hotter as the film moves along. I was having a great time watching this film and then something entered my mind that made me rather nervous. Should I be enjoying a film with this subject matter? I'm really not sure if the film is proper entertainment because even though it's based on a true story the director made no secret that events were changed up for entertainment value. The images in this film are rather harrowing and at times incredibly hard to watch but the viewer, or at least I wanted to see the racist killed. In that sense this entertainment is more like a Death Wish film when I'm not sure if should be. The images of blacks being beaten, raped and hung got me angry and my blood boiling but was it because of great film-making or because seeing these images would make any human angry? I'm really not sure how great the storytelling was but again, on one hand, it kept me entertained all the way through.What does work are the performances by the rather amazing cast. Dafoe has always been an underrated actor and his calm approach in the film is perfectly done and Frances McDormand comes off very good as well. Brad Dourif, R. Lee Ermey, Gailard Sartain, Michael Rooker and Pruitt Taylor Vince play just some of the racist and all of them are bone chilling in their performances. The group of men, on an entertainment level, make for some great movie villains. The real standout here is Hackman who delivers another brilliant performance and really has the toughest job in the film. At one point of the film he's laughing about the racist subject matter and even telling joke but in a blink of an eye Hackman changes his character to show the anger than any human would. The way Hackman juggles his character through so many emotions is a real treat to watch and in my opinion this is one of the best performances from the actor.Once again, I'm torn on the entertainment value a film like this should deliver but after thinking about it for a while I guess this is a perfect film. From what I've read, a lot of controversy surrounded this film as many people felt too many facts were changed to make the FBI look good or whatever. As I write this I'm just going to say that it might be entertainment but it doesn't coward away from showing the horrors of the South at the time.

I'm fine with negative movies just not this one. It makes you feel so horrible and use you get the feeling of what was the point of watching this movie in the first place.The writing is good along with the cinematography which is great giving you the feeling of the chaos we call life. The music is very fitting and the directing is great with every scene showing something different. Kubick is the best in history at disguising a movie as a masterpiece, he has a long track record of it. Even the acting is pretty good at showing the insane world and characters. Malcom Macdowell is just perfect in here.Still this is not enough for me. In order for a movie to be good it has to have some sort of a message. This movie seems to fail horribly at it. This is why we watch movies, to get something out of it. None of these great technical achievements really matter because of this. In order for the technical parts of a movie matter it needs to represent something and that does happen a lot except it does not add up to anything. This makes this movie very shallow rather that deep. What I can credit it for is that it does probably the best job of disguising itself as deep when there is really not much there. This movie feels as if Kubrick is just tying to just impress once again rather than deliver something meaningful.

He sticks to what horror fans love (or at least a good chunk of them) the most- skillfully paced and acted and shot and edited and scored and gored-up suspense\/kill sequences, and an atmosphere that chills without going into the overboard that we've seen all too much lately in American horror. It's also a film that, unlike some of his others, actually isn't as illogical as possibly expected, mostly due to a good but crucial loophole - the supernatural, which provides a lot of leeway with gaps in logic or questions about motive, springing forth enough surreal imagination to outrank many an inferior Italian horror fright-fest.Jessica Harper stars as a woman who is going to a dance school, but there's something funny going on. Rather, not so funny there's been two brutal deaths in one night, the same night Harper first arrives, where a sadistic killer has taken a frantic woman through the wringer and slain another woman equally frantic on the lower level. There's some foul play going on, with Harper getting drugged up each night and nodding out while the women in charge of the school seem to be up to something. There's another death, a blind man by his own dog, and then Harper's good friend seems to have left without a trace, but is really in the darker recesses of the school itself. What is going on? A coven of witches? A possible bad burial ground somewhere? Maybe more for the former it would seem, right out of legend and folklore and 19th century mythology. It's on! Right away we get here some of the Argento classic style little talk, sharp music from Goblin that is like a mix of a music-box and 70s synth\/metal with would-be supervision from John Carpenter. And the cinematography might be the most inventive and dazzling in color and depth and whatnot; I almost imagine Raoul Coutard circa Pierrot le fou was grafted on for the production and injected with a shot of Giallo-vision, and then instructed to provide, in most instances, the kind of measured shocks that have given Hitchcock the reputation he now has. Onward to the plot, if there is much of one, which as well seems to be not as silly as Phenomena or just whacked out like Opera, as there is some very solid line of character going through the proceedings (only a scene where Harper talks to an old expert on witchcraft drags, as any exposition in a genre film might lean toward without the best writing).And in scene after scene, sequence after sequence, Argento solidifies the reputation he has today when he is on top of his game. He's not afraid to go for some of the extra shots of gore or blood that have marked Italian horror the way it is in retrospect, but he's also classy about it. He piles on the artifice, the hyper-stylized lighting, the repetitive and sublimely indicative music, the cuts that seem to indicate little clues and hitting-on-the-head barbs of tension that combined with the performances (which, much like the style, could fit just as well in a super Gothic silent film) makes for a refined sensibility in approaching the genre.

No ruminations of the meaning of life, no endless intellectual babbling about nothing just an incredible trip to the days when radio was king and live with no prepackaged music wrapped around rude loudmouths.The movie spans the time of pre-WWII America into the war years ending in 1944. The movie is narrated by Woody Allen and we see the young version of the narrator in Joe (played by Seth Green). We see his family as they go on about their daily lives, but majority of the film is about the radio shows of the day and the people who made them.The movie is full of anecdotes of supposed radio stars and what they were doing behind the scenes. I don't know if any of them are real but they certainly were enjoyable to watch. Most of the radio personalities were only shown in one or two segments. The one the film did followed was Sally White, played by Mr. Allen's then girlfriend Mia Farrow and adopted mother of his wife. Sally is a radio wannabe who tries everything from sleeping with radio stars when she was a cigarette girl to singing jingles to finally creating a new persona for herself. One funny bit is when she is finally making her debut in a radio drama which coincided with a very important historical event.The other part of the movie is about young Joe and his family. They live in a crowded house. Joe and his parent, his grandparents, an aunt and uncle and their daughter as well as unlucky in love aunt Bea. (One of her dates take place during the night of Ordon Welle's famous War of the Worlds broadcast). Joe's parents are always bickering, one good argument is which is the greater Ocean the Pacific or the Atlantic. As a matter of fact there are a lot of arguing going on in the household and as you can expect from Woody Allen much of it is funny. Watching or rather listening to this movie, one realizes that today's movies have lost a tremendous amount when they rely less on words. Partiicularly comedies that rely so much on sight gags and visual pratfalls.The movie is also wonderful to look at. The set decorators and the location scouts certainly did their job well. The sets, from the fancy restaurants, to a great theater (radio city music hall?) looked incredible. Woody Allen's films are not usually known to be visual feasts but this one certainly is the exception.

This is one of the most interesting horror movies I've seen, if only because it is not a by-the-numbers monster movie or gore fest. Ironicially, while The Body Snatcher takes place in a real-life setting devoid of aliens or monsters, it is far more macabre than any modern horror movie you will see, precisely because it seems like there could be psychos like the characters in this film in real life. The role of the doctor was rather stiff and bland, but the script, adapted from a Robert Louis Stevenson story I've never read, helps this film flow along like fine wine in spite of some of the stiff acting. Boris Karloff, as the ghoulish cabman who does the doctor's dirty work, and acts as a sort of a grim conscience for the amoral physician, is divine in the role. While he may be best remembered for his mumbling Frankenstein's monster or, for the kids, as the narrator of How the Grinch Stole Christmas, he proves in The Body Snatcher that he is a versatile actor who can really do well as a regular human rather than a literal monster, albeit a deliciously creepy, scary, and sinister human with a cockney accent.If you love horror movies, but tire of Freddy Krueger ripping open teenagers or the Queen Alien spewing acid on her unsuspecting space marine victims YET AGAIN, watch this gem.

Roddy McDowall stars as the youngest of a half dozen sons of a headstrong mining headman (Donald Crisp) and his nurturing and humorously anti-intellectual wife (Sara Allgood). His sister Angharad (Maureen O'Hara) is in love with the local minister (Walter Pidgeon), an understanding man who unfortunately decides that she will be happier married to a wealthier man. Did this kind of thing happen in real life, or just in melodrama? What with heavy elements like this forbidden love and the inevitable search for father in the coal mining accident, the movie should feel more contrived than it does. Great credit is due to John Ford's directing. This film has just such an incredibly leisurely and yet deliberate pace. Never does the audience feel as though the conclusions or ideas of the drama are being pushed too hard on us, and yet I also never felt like the film is being obtuse or deliberately slow and studied. I was never hugely interested in the story or even the characters but I never really felt bored. It was kind of an idyll I think is the word, like a dream state. Never more so than in the scenes where Pidgeon takes McDowall up to the hilltop and helps him learn to walk again.One of Ford's most impressive films from what I've seen so far, right up there with The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence and The Long Voyage Home. The drama is kept low key and the characters feel very real. The acting is all very good, especially McDowall in the lead. It's a bit hard to assess Pidgeon's performance. Like in the famous wedding scene, he's in the background and almost literally a shadow. Finally he takes a stand and denounces the hypocritical congregation when they threaten to reprimand his innocent beloved, but he took no stand earlier when they threatened a pregnant unmarried woman. I guess he learned from the earlier experience? I feel I'm missing something there. And that scene where he talked about an army of truth... very good writing but I have to give Pidgeon a lot of credit for being able to pull it off as if it was part of the conversation. The character is in grave danger of coming off as too pompous not just in that scene but in general. So I give Pidgeon credit but he's one character in the movie who's fascinating but not totally believable.There's a striking scene about halfway through that sort of sums up how I feel about the movie's themes. It's when the second pair of brothers has to leave because the mine won't pay their high wages any more, and one son asks the father to read a verse of the Bible. While Crisp is reading, the two sons caress and relax their mother on her chair and there's a tangible feeling of how much they love her and how hard it is to leave her behind, just as the father is saying green pastures. They walk out and when mother briefly protests, Crisp raises his voice just a bit to let her (and us) know that he's aware the sons have left, just as he says the words my cup runneth over. All the bitter pain and the irony and the sentiment of the story are all wrapped up in that scene for anyone who wants to see it.At the end of the movie, I felt overcome with emotion when I saw the flashbacks to the earlier part of the movie and heard the narration about memory. As much as I wanted to see the movie as something of a melodrama, the pace and the style of the thing is just too effective to be easily dismissed or categorized. There's a very human kind of rhythm to the film. It's quite an accomplishment and a beauty to behold.

His transformation from pampered brat to wily survivor is utterly convincing, and often heartbreaking as he confronts the challenges of early adolescence w\/out his parents, and in so desolate a place and time.

At times visually stunning, it contains scenes w\/ Spielberg at his best, such as the slo-mo fly-by of the American pilot, waving at eye level to Bale standing on the roof of one of the camp's buildings, or the horizon-line night shot of the bombing of faraway docks.I have been espousing the virtues of this film for close to 20 years, and I still don't think I can name 10 people I know who've seen it.

The center piece to this movie that still indelibly sticks with me is when Ava Gardner and Gregory Peck meet for their last and final farewell at the dock before the SawFish crew departs back for the U.S. where they decided to spend the remaining days of their lives . In retrospect,this scene still haunts me because I remember it evoked so many mixed and simultaneous emotions of loneliness, immense sadness, honor, duty, love and finally their endearing humanity to each other that tragically and inevitably must end by forces and circumstances beyond their control. There is a sense of despair and helplessness that I remembered having as I exited the theater, even at that young age, which says a lot about the movie. I believe now that Stanley Kramer metaphorically summed up the entire theme in the movie from this scene  there is that indefinable humanity in all of us, arising out of tragic consequences from events that we did not intend or want. I never watched (or wanted to) this movie again until last night on TMC ... almost 50 years later. It was powerful. Ava, Greg, Fred, Tony et. al. deserve more than accolades for their impeccable performances. For those expecting a high-tech disaster movie from On the Beach, they will be disappointed.

James Stewart plays a man confined to a wheelchair with a broken leg who spends all day and night spying on his neighbors. The biggest thing going in his life is his nervousness of his relationship with a rich woman (Grace Kelly) but that's about to change when he thinks one of his neighbors (Raymond Burr) has killed his wife. Here's another film that probably would have been a disaster had anyone else in the world directed but Hitchcock brings his normal brilliance to the film making it one of the greatest ever made. This film has countless layers so it's impossible to catch everything on one viewing, which is why I think the film gets even better with each new viewing. The way Hitchcock has Stewart spy on all the neighbors is something brilliant and we get to know and care for each of them, which pays off greatly towards the end of the film when we're worried about the lonely lady while forgetting to watch Kelly who has snuck into the neighbors home. I've read several reviews that says the film moves too slowly and perhaps this is true but on repeat viewings it's clear that Hitchcock is just setting a trap for the viewer, which leads to a really suspenseful ending. There's no question Stewart is a brilliant actor and while I haven't seen all of his film I might put this at the best performance of his career. Sure, he was brilliant in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, It's a Wonderful Life and various others but he has to do all his acting here in a wheelchair so his facial expressions, voice tones and other small items have to be used throughout the film. How deep of a character he's able to deliver is something not too many actors could do. Grace Kelly is great as well as is Thelma Ritter adds great comic support. Raymond Burr never gets mentioned but he's terrific in the film as well.

High praise, indeed. Oddly enough, X-Men came out in the same calendar year as Unbreakable but sadly, that is where the similarities end.So if Unbreakable is Kubrick crossed with X-Men, it should be an up in the air, some good-some bad, topsy-turvy picture about characters who have problems whilst at the same, maintaining a strong visual and aesthetical sense when dealing with themes and notions &#150; erm; well Unbreakable does have an impressive cast and it does slowly, in an eerie and mythical sort of a way, build up to a point where it explodes in a bout of emotion as a certain character suffers an epiphany that lasts a few scenes; but apart from those things, Unbreakable is a steady if not unspectacular ride through the actual psyche of a superhero. Unbreakable was made at a time when super hero films were not really of a common nature Batman had been and then been respectively killed off; Superman had enjoyed some success but had died a death following a lacklustre 80s sequel or two and most other superheroes like Flash Gordon or Supergirl were given nothing more than camp live action cartoons for films.But then you have Unbreakable, a film that has its idea as What if you were a superhero, you just didn't know it yet? David Dunn (Willis) plays everyday man-come-superhero who is stronger and more aware than he thinks; using telekinetic powers and the ability to predict things before they have a realistic chance of happening. Then you have Elijah Price (Jackson), the fittingly named Mr. Glass as his bones are so weak, he so much as even sneezes violently, he could do himself some serious damage. There are two things that play on the audience's minds from this the first is Dunn's moody and depressed attitude he has but also his mysteriousness that he carries, especially after surviving a train wreck in the first scene. The second is the vulnerability to Price; a man who would be willing to chase a man down a flight of subway stairs if it meant putting himself at great risk, but proving to himself at least, that he was correct in assuming something. This is where we wince and cringe as Price puts himself at risk for various items of information; an impressive thing to be able to do in a film.Close attention has also been paid to the way the film looks and the way it has been shot; I think Shyamalan has, in all of his films regardless of overall quality, shot and produced wonderful cinematography to capture the mood and feel of the film; be it of the depressing, dreamlike or fairytale variety. Here, the long takes and bleak cinematography compliment the camera work which is vast in its moving around and tracking as it focuses on its subjects. The camera-work retains a certain point of view feeling; there the very first scene to talk about in which we see Dunn and a random woman talk on the train; we see it from through the gap in the seats in front, retaining a child-like quality for the composition since I feel it's the sort of thing a child may do when fed up and sitting on a train; this echo's Shyamalan's later film Lady in the Water which itself was a child-like fable. But, there is also sweeping camera over the roof of Dunn's car as he finds the note from Price; again, this was a sort of point of view composition as the director utilises reflections and patterns on screen.I think Unbreakable is a fascinating film for other reasons, though. I think it's quite funny how, nearer the beginning, Price tries to talk to Willis' character about how he could well be this hard-bodied superhero and Willis plays him down. This is, of course, Willis going against what he had been doing practically his whole career up to this point playing the hard-bodied action guy but now he is denying that he has any kind of those characteristics; interesting to read further into it, is that Willis played a clam and more sedate character in Shyamalan's previous film The Sixth Sense. However, while the look of the film is impressive and the camera work long, slow and deliberate; Price seems to be convinced a little too easily that Dunn is his man since there are more disasters that happen in the world that Price would lead us onto believe; does the man Price is looking for have to be American? There is also the segment that focuses on Dunn trying to re-fall in love with his estranged wife that seems a little out of place in a film all about finding ones identity within.But while the climax and the denouement would have Dunn rather obviously facing his fears whilst systematically coming to terms with whom or what he is, some may complain it is too short and sudden to be entertaining and too incidental to feel original. While these are small complaints, Unbreakable remains a strong and teasing picture about self-discovery; about what it's like to find yourself and about what it's like to help people; to stand up and be responsible when you discover you are able to be. Shyamalan may not have made a masterpiece but he has made a film that is interesting and unpredictable for the best part while making us want more after it has finished.
