[{"date":"15 December 2015","score":"","review":" This combination hand-drawn\/computer animation film was the directorial debut of Brad Bird. There will be spoilers ahead This is an extraordinary mix of two different animation techniques and it manages this amazingly well. Based on an excellent novel by Ted Hughes, though it was critically acclaimed (deservedly so) it performed poorly in its initial run at the theaters, probably because the marketing left much to be desired. It's managed to find its audience through home video and word of mouth and it now gets the appreciation it deserves.I'll just to a basic synopsis of the plot and discuss the technical aspects a bit. Set in 1957, just after Sputnik's launch, a huge robot crashes just off the coast of Maine. It comes ashore and eventually meets a young boy named Hogarth. After a series of misadventures and the robot's near destruction and recovery, Hogarth starts teaching the robot various things through reading him comic books. The robot is impressed with Superman.Needless to say, the crash of the robot and his actions draw the attention of the authorities, represented by a smarmy jackass working as an FBI agent and an Army general. Hogarth tries to hide the robot, which, given its size, is no easy task. He gets the help of a proto-hippie\/beatnik\/sculptor who runs the junkyard (this comes in handy, because the robot eats metal).The FBI and the military become aware of the robot eventually and through a series of misunderstandings and outright lies, the military moves to destroy the robot, even to the point of setting up a nuclear strike from a sub. The jackass government agent sets in motion certain destruction of the town, only to have the robot perform an heroic act to save everyone. The ending of the film is perfect.The technical aspects of the film are great, from a top-notch script through great voice work, magnificent animation, a perfect score for the film and the timing is excellent. The film won a good many animation awards and was lauded by critics at the time. It's a fantastic film.This film is available on DVD and was released on Blu-Ray this year (2015) in a Signature Edition, which I have yet to see. Regardless, this film is most highly recommended.

Howard's decision to go the live action route as opposed to animation was admirable, as it more than likely resulted in a much more daunting undertaking. The star of the film is the set design, starting with the quaint blueprint of Seuss's beloved book, and piling on decadent, surreal spectacle until we are presented with a world where every corner of every frame is a giddily cluttered piece of eye candy and raucous auditory nuttiness. Starting with the Grinch's lair on snow laden Mount Crumpet, a garbage encrusted haven of rickety inventions and off kilter lighting, to the loopy, majestically over the top town of Whoville in the valley below, every set piece is so overdone and buzzing with creative energy it boggles the senses. In that sense, the film succeeds glowingly. Now, on to the makeup. It's my only gripe with the film and one I can't get over no matter how much I try and look past it. This excludes the Grinch himself of course, they did a wonderful job with him, which I'll get to in a minute. The other Whovians, though, look slightly terrifying, and the decision to try and exactly recreate the way Seuss drew their characteristics, mayyy not have been the best idea. Little Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen) looks alright, but her dad Lou (Bill Irwin, the voice of TARS from Interstellar) and some of the other adults look very unsettling with their eerily upturned noses and clay set grins, like a drunk plastic surgeon had his way with them using only a cookie cutter. Then there's the baby Grinch.. Who I think was supposed to be cute, but ends up looking like something that a Mogwai would have a nightmare about. It's all in good fun though, and doesn't hurt the film too much, just a quibble I have. When one steps back and admires the movie as a whole, the positives outweigh the negatives. Jim Carrey must be commended for letting another funny, hyperactive performance shine through pounds of makeup plastered all over his face and figure. He never loses that spark that makes his presence so unique, and although great amounts of new dialogue and interaction that weren't in the book have been added, especially with his character, he still manages to retain that 'Seussy' outlook and vernacular (something that The Cat In The Hat failed miserably at, Mike Myers being the chief culprit). Carrey even adds poignancy to the Grinch's delicate, near manic balancing act of bitterness and hate, with a sweetness clawing to get out. That dynamic could have been suppressed into childlike simplicity, but he plays him at an adult level, to the film's advantage. The supporting cast is cool too, showcasing Jeffrey Tambor as the town's smarmy Mayor, Christine Baranski as foxy Martha May Whovier as well as Mindy Sterling, Molly Shannon, Clint Howard, Bryce Dallas Howard, Q'orianka Kilcher, Verne Troyer and a kindly Anthony Hopkins as the unseen narrator, the only person who gets to speak actual passages from the book. My favourite moment? The tiny, pint sized Who's driving around in their little football sized car. It's oddball little quirks that make the movie work and are its strong suits; a warm, weird sense of humour and endlessly creative visual palette that amp up the Christmas cheer dial to eleven.

After all, this film has recently made history once again, when Syfy Channel has chosen to adapted it, into a television show in early 2015. With that said, I have to say, unlike the show, which is a remake of the film; the original movie '12 Monkeys' is more of a reimagining, than a remake of the 1962 French short film, 'La Jetée', written by Chris Marker. While, it's true, that La Jetée and 12 Monkeys have some similarities; such in the case, of the main character, which both has a man redreaming of a childhood tragedy and time travelling to stop it. Still, these films couldn't easily be compared with each other. Marker's La Jetee is about a man trying to escape the aftermath of World War III in post-apocalyptic world, by travelling in the past to find his love; while 12 Monkeys is about, a man, James Cole (Bruce Willis) sent to the past, gather information about the man-made virus that wiped out most of the human population on the planet. Although, La Jetee inject their story with an intimate humanistic quality, juxtaposing romance with an eerie atmosphere of impending disaster. The big different is that 12 Monkeys screenplay written by David and Janet Peoples is much more grandeur with its theme; interlocking dramatic social commentary about the world's environment, the struggles of mental help, and how people view religion. Could psychiatry be seem as a new religion!? Is Faith is a delusion!? Does the march of time, prove that what we deem insane, today; might seem normal, tomorrow? These are the brilliant questions that this movie brings to us. While, yes, this film does perversion the original intent of Marker's film message, but, Gilliam's version gives more to the table then the 1962 nuclear holocaust drama. It's reasons like these, why it feels like Gilliam's version is more like its own standalone masterpiece of contemporary cinema, rather than a remake. Plus the special combination of directorial vision, superb writing, and mood enhancing cinematography delivered an engaging piece of dramatic fiction. One thing, that this Terry Gilliam's film has, over that French short film is a superb cast. Bruce Willis delivers one of his most nuanced performances as Cole, creating a strong yet vulnerable man who must overcome his own fears of madness in order to save humanity. Brad Pitts plays against his pretty boy typecast, here, as the crazy, and paranoid schizophrenic, Jeffrey Goines. Meanwhile, Madeleine Stowe gives alright performance as Dr. Kathryn Reilly, who must call into question all of her long held beliefs, and face the insanity of the world around her. I like her lectures on abnormal psychology and the theoretical Cassandra complex. It was somewhat brilliance, nevertheless, her falling in love scenes with Cole need some work. It wasn't convincing. Another great thing from the film is the music by Paul Buckmaster. It's so eerily with its creepy circus like theme. However, I do have to say, the movie does have some faults in the eyes of some critics. As with most Terry Gilliam films, this film is often dense in grim darkness to the point, that certain people find them, somewhat depressing to watch. The whole bittersweet ending is a bit hard to take for some. Another problem is all the film references and shout outs such as 1958's Vertigo, 1931's Monkey Business, Blade Runner & 1985's Brazil. It comes across as a cheesy homage. Terry Gilliam's 'Monty Python cartoony style of realism mixed with sci-fi fantasy is a bit jarring. In my eyes, the pacing is a problem as well. I didn't like the repetitive annoying nature of the childhood flashback dream sequences. It was a bit overwhelming. I also didn't really buy, those dream-like scenes, Gilliam has, as a great example of human thought. La Jetee, somewhat address this matter, better with its slide-show, motionless black & white style. It seem more like a dream in the unconscious mind than Gilliam's version. The still moving images works best when exploring dream, memory and the concept of time with its simplicity. However, as a grand motion picture film, 12 Monkeys is superior in that field. La Jetee can barely be count as a film. Another problem in the film is the complex story. It seem to be missing a lot of things to make it, perfect. There are a lot of unexplained sequences in the film such like the 'Bob scene that really doesn't add up, logically. The whole 'butterfly effect' is also a bit confusing, when you take in 'You Can't Fight Fate' aspect. So, why, then, do the future scientists give Cole a gun to change history? Did Cole alter history or not? Also, what was 'the insurance' lady, talking about? We might never know. Some viewers found these unanswered questions to be a bit muddled. Despite that, I do like Terry Gilliam's brilliance. The fact that he doesn't dictate his story to the viewers; rather he allows them to discover its subtleties and secrets on their own, and then draw their own conclusions is good. It makes the film even more interesting to watch with a group of friends and everyone's perception of the ending is contrary. It's this idea of open interpretation that makes 12 Monkeys so timeless. Overall It's worth watching and worth discussing about. A must-watch.

It's such a classic that it's catchy songs, distinct characters and boundless imagination have ingrained it into the collective consciousness of pop culture for eternity. It paved the roads of animation with its innovative, eye candy stop motion animation (my favorite style) and lit up the musical genre with its crowd pleasing ballads of pure holiday joy. By now anyone who hasn't seen this and doesn't know the plot really needs to rethink their life choices, but for those few lost souls who haven't seen it, I'll go I'll to the plot a bit, because I love talking about it. In a far off fantasy realm called Halloweentown, the residents toil endlessly all year for their annual festivities. They're a wide variety of whacky creatures, including werewolves, bicycle riding clowns, witches, ghouls sand so many more.

Nabokov himself co- wrote the screenplay for the film along with Kubrick. The plot follows a European professor named Humbert Humbert who relocates to an American suburb. He rents a room from a lonely window Charlotte and then comes across her young teenage daughter Lolita. He ends up feeling an instant attraction towards Lolita. Humbert ends up marrying Charlotte with the sole intention of being close to Lolita and pursuing her. This attraction towards Lolita slowly and gradually becomes an obsession which engulfs Humbert and pushes him over the edge and into a state of paranoia and constant jealousy. The original novel which I have not read, was considered to be a hugely controversial piece of work as the disturbing nature of the storyline was taboo and far too risqué for the fifties. The film could have been even more controversial as this was the adaptation of the controversial story on the screen in the visual medium. But Kubrick used interesting and subtle ways to hint and imply certain things without actually being explicit about them. I think I noticed an underlying theme of two cultures coming into contact. There is Humbert who is the European who goes to America to find a home and work. He comes across an overly sexed up society of the upper-middle class, but he is only interested in the young Lolita. In a twisted way, Humbert's obsession for Lolita could have been used to symbolise the European immigrant's desperate attempt to own and be a part of America's future. The atmosphere and environment that surrounds the characters is messed up and filled with lust and greed and manipulation. Every character is pursuing someone else with a fair share of lust, but it is Humbert's pursuit of Lolita that gets the attention because of her age. A sex crazed and obnoxious society similar to this one was also present in 'A Clockwork Orange', another Kubrick film.Having said all that, overall I don't think the film is supposed to be analysed and scrutinised so minutely. Kubrick treats Nabokov's story almost like a comedy. There are so many sexual innuendos and euphemisms which will remind you of sex comedies like 'American Pie' and 'Eurotrip', there is a significant amount of slapstick comedy, there are the antics of Peter Sellers,etc. All the aforementioned things makes me believe that this was meant to be a comedy even though it deals with pedophilia, a very sensitive and disturbing issue.I think Kubrick's career as a filmmaker can be divided into 2 parts the pre Dr. Strangelove era and the post Dr. Strangelove era. I think from Dr. Stangelove onwards, Kubrick managed to distinguish himself from the other filmmakers and created his signature Kubrick style. Along with Dr. Strangelove, all the subsequent films that he directed can be easily identified as Kubrick films just by looking at any random scene. 'Lolita' is a film from the pre Dr. Strangelove era of Kubrick's filmography and so it does not have that distinctive Kubrick touch and feel that all of us love. The only film that he made before Dr. Strangelove that I love is 'Paths of Glory'. 'Lolita' is a good film, but it didn't have that wow factor that you get from other Kubrick films. Kubrick tells the story well, but the style is very reminiscent of the other Hollywood films of the late 50s and early 60s. It didn't have a lasting impact on me. It's a very standard noir-ish film, the likes of which became very popular during that era of Hollywood filmmaking. To finish, I will have to say that 'Lolita' is certainly not one of Kubrick's best films. It is technically well made, the plot moves briskly and the pacing is good as for a 2 hour 30 minutes long film, it didn't seem to overstay its welcome and it has a good performance from James Mason. However, it didn't overwhelm me and it didn't linger in my thoughts for too long. It's good, but not 'Kubrick good'.

It's pretty easy to see why, I don't really want to tell them to cut Jedi some slack and say you shouldn't expect much from it since I find that logic kinda ludicrous. I mean, it's the sequel to my favorite movie of all time, of course I'm gonna judge it by its own merits. I'm not going to give it some sort of handicap mainly because Empire was a sequel and it improved upon the first movie.Luckily, I really enjoy watching Return of the Jedi, probably a lot more than most people. This is probably because Lawrence Kasdan returned as one of the writers and I credit every great moment in this movie to him. The other writer was actually George Lucas and... it's pretty clear his creativity was nowhere near as great as Lawrence's. Lucas' writing here is nowhere near as bad as the Star Wars prequels, but it still isn't as good.While Jedi may not have pitch perfect storytelling like Empire did, the movie more than makes up for it with its creative personality. I LOVE the creature effects from Jim Henson's Creature Shop. Every time you watch the opening in Jabba's Palace, you notice a new alien species you never saw before (Also I LOVE the Rancor. He's such a cute, yet threatening muppet).Now, the Ewoks? I... don't hate the Ewoks. They are designed to sell some toys (I blame Lucas) and I don't really like the idea that they helped diminished the Galactic Empire (which is why I'm kinda happy The Force Awakens is happening). However, I do think they provide some solid entertainment in the final battle and I'll even admit I think they're pretty cute. Plus, they're nowhere near as useless as Jar Jar Binks. The space battles are also well done and ended up getting this movie the same Special Achievement Oscar the previous film got.The best and strongest part of this movie, hands down, goes towards any scene featuring Luke & Vader. This is straight up Lawrence Kasdan's doings since they maintain the same level of drama 'Empire Strikes Back' provided. I seriously think George Lucas had nothing to do with these scenes and probably took over the stuff on Endor once Lawrence got Luke off the planet and on the new Death Star. I love the engaging lightsaber battle near the end that's commentated by the oh so evil Emperor. The Emperor is sort of like an Anti-Yoda, he uses the force for evil and also uses it for brutal attack. He's the type of threatening villain you find entertaining and Ian McDiarmid's voice does such a good job selling The Emperor.John Williams' film score is once again terrific and helps any scene in this movie become emotional and very involving. I love the Sarlaac Pit sequence's score, the music that plays during Luke & Vader's lightsaber duel, during the battle on Endor, and I also really like (and miss) the Yub Nub song the Ewoks sing at the end. It was so damn catchy.The special edition for this movie seems to have gotten much worse with each release. Lucas got rid of Yub Nub and had John Williams compose a new song, which was alright but I miss Yub Nub... In the 2004 DVD, Lucas added that incredibly jarring & stupid Jedi Rocks music number that was added during a scene where Jabba brutally sacrifices one of his slaves to his pet Rancor. Yeah, mood whiplash seems to be something Lucas likes to do... And on the Blu-ray release, Lucas added an unneeded NOOOOO! during the climax where Vader saves Luke from the Emperor, ruining yet ANOTHER great scene (the first being Han blasting Greedo in the bar).It's safe to say that Return of the Jedi got the worst Special Edition out of the entire trilogy. The only thing I do like from this version was the newly designed poster. I like the green background and I like how Chewbacca is on it with Vader & Luke at the center frame. Disney & Fox need to get the original cuts of these movies on Blu- ray right now. Being forced to buy only the Special Editions is pretty pathetic.With that said, I enjoy ROTJ.

I'm not going to give it some sort of handicap mainly because Empire was a sequel and it improved upon the first movie.Luckily, I really enjoy watching Return of the Jedi, probably a lot more than most people. This is probably because Lawrence Kasdan returned as one of the writers and I credit every great moment in this movie to him. The other writer was actually George Lucas and... it's pretty clear his creativity was nowhere near as great as Lawrence's. Lucas' writing here is nowhere near as bad as the Star Wars prequels, but it still isn't as good.While Jedi may not have pitch perfect storytelling like Empire did, the movie more than makes up for it with its creative personality. I LOVE the creature effects from Jim Henson's Creature Shop. Every time you watch the opening in Jabba's Palace, you notice a new alien species you never saw before (Also I LOVE the Rancor. He's such a cute, yet threatening muppet).Now, the Ewoks? I... don't hate the Ewoks. They are designed to sell some toys (I blame Lucas) and I don't really like the idea that they helped diminished the Galactic Empire (which is why I'm kinda happy The Force Awakens is happening).

I hate to admit it but before I watched this movie I knew essentially nothing about him. I knew he was an important leader in the liberation of India from England's rule but the real implication of his actions throughout his life had never really been brought to my attention. To understand Gandhi a person has to study a fifty-year period of history that includes both major events in India as well as Africa. This is where the film really shines; it takes all these events and presents them concisely by focusing on Gandhi and relating the events he was involved in to him instead of starting with the events and including the players as almost an afterthought the way many text books would. This makes the information easily accessible for anyone regardless of foreknowledge. The film opens with 300,000 extras attending Gandhi's funeral, more than any movie made before or since, to capture the scope of how revered he really was. These people are packed along the street as his coffin is moved through the city suggesting far greater numbers as if everyone in India was there. As this spectacle is being shown a radio station reporter's monologue played. He is trying to put into words, overwhelmed but still very articulate, how extraordinarily important the life that had just ended was to the world. He notes that Gandhi never held a political office, was not a religious leader, and never held any authoritarian title and yet people followed him with an unrivaled dedication.The way he used hunger strikes and risked his own health to keep the protest from becoming riots by starving himself until people behaved is shown in a way that articulates his actions and motives perfectly. The way the film addresses the problems faced by the cotton farmers really reminds me of the way films such as the GRAPES OF WRATH, BOUND FOR GLORY and many others depict the struggles of farmers during the depression in America. The film also shows how India's sovereignty leads to the formation of Pakistan by India's Islamic minority, something that I was not familiar with before seeing the movie. Director, Richard Attenborough (perhaps best known by audiences as the Colonel Sanders impersonating proprietor of Jurassic Park) struggled for over twenty years to get support for this movie to be made and it couldn't have been any better if he had spent every day of those twenty some ought years creating this film. So much information is presented here with a degree of accuracy that is almost never seen in a Hollywood production (THE DOORS, it's like a slap in the face for their fans;) I'm truly surprised it's not used as a teaching tool in all history classes. More than its informative value, this movie is a fitting a tribute to the man who is the figurehead for peaceful protest, pacifism, and all positive changes is government policy. He was a person who didn't need a legend because his factual acts outdid any possible fallacies and I learned most of what I know about him from this movie.

And the failure of the father to submit to the lot of Job means that he must suffer God's wrath and further punishment. God's will be done, as they say. Not a bad message coming from Islam in one sense One should shoulder one's responsibilities towards others who are needy; but, do we need the threat of divine punishment to recognize this duty we all have to do the right thing?

It's really the story of Job told in an Islamic setting. The commandment that comes from on high is to acknowledge and submit to your lot in life--in the case of the father to devote himself to his son and his well-being, despite the heavy burden that that imposes on him. There's also the message that, along life's way, we must always be attentive to the needs of others (as exemplified, in a positive way, by the blind boy's rescue of animalitos in distress; and, in a negative way, by the father's lack of attention to the turtle on its back and in distress). And the failure of the father to submit to the lot of Job means that he must suffer God's wrath and further punishment. God's will be done, as they say. Not a bad message coming from Islam in one sense One should shoulder one's responsibilities towards others who are needy; but, do we need the threat of divine punishment to recognize this duty we all have to do the right thing? After all, a humanist doesn't need to read the Koran to know that we should do unto others as we would have them do unto us. For my taste, just too easy a play for and manipulation of our feelings with the use of a blind kid.

Death Wish 4 The Crackdown is an exciting film that is another good entry in the franchise. While it's not as good as the original film, it still is an enjoyable film that is worth watching, especially if you are a fan of the series, or a fan of Charles Bronson for that matter. While the formula was somewhat beginning to age, it's somewhat averted because of the kind of bad guys that Kersey battles in this film. Instead of battling just common street thugs, he actually is taking on organized crime, which is nice to see as it's different from the three previous movies.By this point, you'd probably expect Charles Bronson to be running out of steam, but he shows here that he's still capable of doing good even at his age (he was about 67 at the time this film was made). In this film, the way he pulls off the action sequences in this movie is really something, it's definitely much more convincing than some of the movies of today that Sylvester Stallone does. Bronson was probably the greatest action film star who ever lived, as he could turn just an average (or even a below average) action film and turn it into something enjoyable, and it's always fun to see him go after bad guys and triumph.This movie features a rather interesting supporting cast. With people such as John P. Ryan, Perry Lopez, George Dickerson, and even a young Danny Trejo. John P. Ryan plays Nathan White, the publisher who recruits Paul to take down the drug empires in Los Angeles, but is White all who he seems he is? Perry Lopez (who was superb in Chinatown) was good as Ed Zacharias, one of the two drug leaders in L.A. George Dickerson plays Sid Reiner, a policeman who is less sympathetic than Ochoa and Shriker, and is determined to prove that Paul is the vigilante. But as expected, it's Bronson who shines the most, who makes another good turn in his most famous role.Like I mentioned, this movie has Bronson taking on a different kind of enemy. Rather than shooting common street thugs, he gives a go at his first wave of organized crime. He gets the job done with more than just bullets, but also with grenade launchers and exploding bottles of wine. And like the previous movie, there is a big kill count in this one, while not as many as Death Wish 3, this film still contains a large amount of kills. So basically, Los Angeles turns into what New York turned into in the third film, a war zone, with numerous kills left and right, with Bronson doing most of them.This installment has a new film director, J. Lee Thompson. Thompson had previously worked with Bronson on other films like 10 to Midnight, The White Buffalo, and Murphy's Law, and that is a combo with chemistry. In a movie different from that of Michael Winner, Thompson puts a lot of emphasis on the action and not so much the drama, as there isn't exactly a rape scene in this movie (save for the beginning), which was something that appeared in the three previous films. Bronson and Thompson made some good works together, and this film is definitely one of them.All in all, while Death Wish 4 is definitely not the best film in the series, it's still worth watching. If you enjoyed the previous installments, then you should watch this next one, as it's another worth entry in the franchise, and it's more proof of Bronson's ability to shine in action roles. Although I do find The Great Escape, Once Upon A Time In The West, and The Magnificent Seven to be Bronson's best films, I still found lots to enjoy in this film, as it's exciting, thrilling, tense, and overall a good time.8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"15 December 2015","score":"","review":" After his girlfriend's daughter dies from a drug overdose, Paul Kersey finds himself involuntarily recruited by a publisher to take down two drug empires in the Los Angeles Area.Beginning with the third film, The Death Wish series really began to ramp up the action, and it really shows in this fourth installment.

On that note, Suicide Kings makes a rewarding, if slight entry into the niche. It's got a well rounded cast, smart ass dialogue and some moments of pure, unfiltered black comedy. Parts of it are unfocused and not all attempts at humour land squarely, but when it's good, it's good, baby. The key ingredient in any crime\/comedy? Stupid people. You have to have some dundering friggin morons who think they got what it takes to pull off some idiotic scheme that's well above their pay grade and intellegience level. They show up here in the form of a gaggle of cocky frat boys who attempt to kidnap an ex mafioso for ransom. Slick pretty boy Sean Patrick Flanery, anxious dweeb Johnny Galecki, reserved Doctor Jeremy Sisto, terrified sensitive boy Henry Thomas and arrogent hotshot Jay Mohr. The mafioso is played by...guess. yep, Christopher Walken, silkily dangerous as Charlie Bartolucci, a guy who used to be a guy you don't want to mess with, and as the film progresses, unravels back to that volatile state. Walken spends most of the film tied to a chair and even then finds ways to amuse and terrify with his impish aura. Another key component in these neo noir's an angry bad dude sent to inflict all kinds of pain and suffering on the idiots, personified by wiseass Lono Vecchio (Denis Leary). He hunts them down with verve, also dealing with two clinically insane hit men (Brad Garrett and Frank Medrano, priceless) who are involved as well. The plot thickens to just this side of convoluted, as the boys realize that one amongst them is pulling a nasty Judas on the other four. Leary, like I said before, is capable of staggering gravitas in between sessions of manic joker antics. Here the film stops dead in its tracks midway through so he can teach an abusive father a cringe worthy, painful lesson, preceded by a sorrowful monologue about his youth. It's the best part of the film in the sense that the tone is completely different from every other scene, making it memorable. This one isn't perfect, I wouldn't call it an amazing flick, but it's got moments of pure genius, and overall is pretty fun, if only two thirds of a great one. Worth it for Walken and Leary.

This is what makes the movie come to life and for you to know what people went through, if they kept the violence out they wouldn't have got their point across as well as they did. I very much enjoyed this film and is one of the best I've seen The acting in this film was amazing and I think they made a good decision on picking the actors they did. They picked actors that somewhat look like the men from the real life story. They also picked actors by just looking at them they had a strong presence of hatred. I really liked the good cop bad cop aspect and having two FBI agents that have totally different styles. For example Anderson is very charming, easy to talk to and relaxed. You can even tell this by his costume, loose tie non ironed shirt and he does not often wear a suit jacket. On the other hand Ward is very serious and isn't friendly with his witnesses. His costume is very stiff, clean cut and always wears a part in his hair and a full suit jacket at all times. The only thing I think the makers of the film could have made better was the structure or the outcome of the story line. Right from the beginning you know what is going to happen by the end of the film. However it is an ending that can sit right with everyone. I think they took the safe route by not switching up the storyline just to make the viewers happy. If they were to make a not so predictable ending that would make the media talk more about the film. The best part of the film is the cinematography and lighting. For example using lighting from the bottom of the actors faces to make people look more evil and sinister. The director also did a lot of making certain characters more superior by filming the actor they want to have power in the scene up higher so they look in charge. Lastly they made the lighting darker for the very brutal parts such as killing to give it a creepy evil vibe while still keeping it appropriate to put in a film.Mississippi burning had its own type of music like building up (i.e. car chase) music that continues to get louder and more intense the more it goes on. Once something brutal and awful is happening there is soulful gospel music. Even when nothing is happening or no actor is saying there lines, if you listen close you can always here the noise of crickets in the background.In conclusion I would give this film 4 stars out of 5.

Lastly they made the lighting darker for the very brutal parts such as killing to give it a creepy evil vibe while still keeping it appropriate to put in a film.Mississippi burning had its own type of music like building up (i.e. car chase) music that continues to get louder and more intense the more it goes on. Once something brutal and awful is happening there is soulful gospel music. Even when nothing is happening or no actor is saying there lines, if you listen close you can always here the noise of crickets in the background.In conclusion I would give this film 4 stars out of 5. The cinematography and lighting was amazing, same with the music and actors. However the storyline's outcome was to predicable and they could have made the outcome more shocking.

After when Mildred'd husband leaves her she has to get a job in order to support her family. After sometime she eventually is able to open up her own business. However, if there was any character in the film that made me hate her the most was Mildred's daughter. The actress that played her did an amazing job as coming off as a spoiled rich child. Another thing that I loved about this film that the entire story is told through a flash back. And only on some occasions would it go back to present time and progress the story just enough to keep the story going. The story is enjoyable to watch and I highly recommend that you go and watch it.

Now I can't say I was expecting a great deal from the film after hearing a few bad comments, but I tend to take a liking to psychological thrillers, and so figured I'd give it a shot. Was I pleasantly surprised!The first few minutes of film do a marvelous job at establishing the setting. Great shots of the dilapidated complex provide a true sense of mystery, as well as the dark undertones of the story. The characters and their accompanying personalities within the film are nothing special, but the relationships are believable, and no acting failures to be seen.By the time the film has progressed to its halfway point, the air of mystery is already becoming quite thick. If your attention wasn't grasped within the first few minutes of the film, it certainly will be by now if you've been paying attention to detail. Many a creepy moment can be observed, and true genuine tension and suspense emphasises the power of this film.Finally after about an hour and a half of true viewer anxiety, the film wraps up. While the conclusion certainly isn't an outstanding twist from far out of left field, it's by no means a let down. It certainly kept me entertained, and final dialogue left me with a sense of awe and utter appreciation for the craftsmanship present.All in all, Session 9 is a powerful and intelligent psychological thriller that is immensely entertaining, and terrifyingly creepy throughout. A few powerful shots will continue to make me shudder for a long time to come.

For those who have read the book, the extended edition is recommended as it has added scenes and is more accurate to the book. The casting fit the characters very well, and the writing was magnificent. The environments created were very detailed and very fitting for the story, thumbs up for Jackson on that. While the length can be unappealing to some, it is excusable considering the effort put into the film and the quality of the finished product. Howard Shore's soundtrack was magnificent, I listened to it while reading the book and it fit incredibly well. The soundtrack is varied and never gets bland or sounds out of place.

The plot seemed interesting enough and the movie poster looked creepy, so I had rather high expectations on this one. And I have to say I don't agree with all the positive reviews at all, except for one thing Most horror flicks nowadays only have a lot of blood and jump scares (which I also like, to be honest) and there are only few movies that scare you on a subtle, psychological level. And, according to the reviews, Session 9 should be one of those films. But it is not, in my opinion. Not at all.There is hardly any build up of tension during the first hour of the film, only a few moments. And don't get me wrong, I AM a fan of movies with a slow build up, but this one was just boring. The characters were not very believable, although the makers tried to make them deep, but failed in my opinion. There are quite a few things going on, so you have to keep attention and get curious how everything will solve in the end. So it is kinda interesting for about half an hour. But then, the story becomes extremely predictable. It is a very cookie-cutter type of horror\/thriller story and has no interesting or fresh aspects. I also didn't like the fact that the whole action went on in the last 10 minutes. It seemed very hesitated. Too much dialogue that could have been left out since it didn't make the characters any more credible, and too many different things going on that could also haven been left out since they didn't really tie together in the end (or at least didn't ad much to the story).Last but not least, the film lacked of atmosphere. If I watch a horror film without the typical jump scare stuff, I expect it to have dense atmosphere that chills you to the bone, and Session 9 failed to deliver such atmosphere. The only thing I thought was creepy was the old wheel chair from the movie poster.
