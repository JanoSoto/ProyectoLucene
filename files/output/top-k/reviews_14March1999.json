[{"date":"14 March 1999","score":"","review":"  EDtv is The Truman Show lite.  A product of the mass-media culture it pretends to abhor, it raises the same questions about media inundation and the decay of privacy, but with none of Truman's ingenuity.  Truman challenged the audience, while EDtv panders to the easily entertained.Like Truman, the main character is a man whose entire life is broadcast on television; the only difference is that Ed knows it.  In fact, he dimwittedly signs a contract allowing a film crew to document his every move.All of the clever wrinkles that made Truman one of 1998's very best films have been ironed out of EDtv for the sake of mass appeal.  Instead of Peter Weir, the Australian auteur who has puzzled and provoked audiences with daring films like Fearless, EDtv offers Ron Howard, the Hollywood pro who puts no personal stamp on his movies.  Instead of Jim Carrey defying expectations and expanding his range in a brave dramatic performance, EDtv gives us Matthew McConaughey doing what he does best, the only thing he *can* do being Matthew McConaughey.  Like Truman, EDtv features cutaways to loyal viewers, but unlike the delightfully quirky collection of Truman-philes, Ed's fans consist of a politically correct cross-section of America--an African American couple, a gay couple, a trio of Latino chefs, and a dormful of girls at the University of Iowa.What's worse, EDtv offers no subtext.  Truman was a multi-layered film Aside from commenting on the power of television to shape our views and dominate our lives, it also explored humankind's relation to God (if there is one) and questioned the implications of living in a created universe. EDtv contains nothing beneath its explicit surface message that the phenomena of instant celebrity and the destruction of privacy are B-A-D T-H-I-N-G-S.Ultimately, the film fails to engage the viewer.  Howard's slick direction and McConaughey's superficial acting turn Ed into little more than a genial presence on the screen.  Some viewers may care about what befalls him, but I wanted to grab the remote. ","genre":null},{"date":"14 March 1999","score":"","review":"  EDtv is The Truman Show lite.

The actors all seem to be having lots of fun with the script, probably because they have had an actual experience like Ed does at one point in their career.Of particular note is Jenna Elfman, who plays completely against type and shows excellent range as a dramatic actress. Also good are Matthew McCounaghey, who finally lives up to his hype, Elizabeth Hurley pokes fun at herself in a few spots, acting well also, Rob Reiner, very funny as a corporate bigwig, and Ellen DeGeneres is very good as a voice of reason throughout the picture.This movie can be considered as a well timed message from stars to fans on showing what their life can be like at times. It is also bitingly funny, and all together, another winner from Ron Howard.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"14 March 1999","score":"","review":" `EdTV' I've never thought Ron Howard is that good a director. Almost every film he has made has been undone by his desire to employ a kind of all encompassing drama.  All the colors of the emotional rainbow need to be there for him to stop the film.  `EdTV' suffers from this problem as well.  It shouldn't, the cast is the best Howard has ever had to work with. Matthew McConeghey really shines here in the lead role.  I've liked this guy so much since he broke, but he has so much potential that just isn't being used.  The goofy laid back charm the he showed in `Dazed And Confused' is deployed in this film.  He shows a remarkable chemistry with co-star Jenna Elfman.  With Elfman, along with Ellen DeGeneres, Martin Landau, Sally Kirkland, and Woody Harrelson, I was truly shocked to see all of these actors being so effective.  They all hit their marks superbly, with Elfman especially good.  The message of `EdTV' can be picked up on in the first 5 minutes, but Howard doesn't seem to want to take a chance that we might miss it.  The lack of faith in the audience's intelligence is really appalling.  The movie keeps stopping the action, or comedy, just to remind us of the moral of the story.  Start-stop, start-stop...  It's just too much of an erratic tone to really get used to.  I found myself beginning to tire of this film as it kept slipping back into unneeded dramatics.Elizabeth Hurley is truly wasted in a poorly conceived subplot that seems way too silly for the film.  I wish I could like this movie more, but Ron Howard won't let me.------------ 6  ","genre":null},{"date":"14 March 1999","score":"","review":" `EdTV' I've never thought Ron Howard is that good a director.
