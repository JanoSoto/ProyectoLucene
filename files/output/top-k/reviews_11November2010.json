I noticed the original listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, so I was very interested to see it, from Golden Globe nominated director Robert Wise (The Day the Earth Stood Still, The Sound of Music). Basically Dr. John Markway (Richard Johnson) is doing research into the existence of ghosts, investigating the large mansion Hill House, with a history of violence and insanity. To help him out he has invited Luke Sanderson (Russ Tamblyn) who is next to inherit the house, and two students, Eleanor 'Nell' Lance (Julie Harris) and Theodora 'Theo' (Claire Bloom), the only two of about eight to respond. Luke doesn't believe that anything can or will happen in the paranormal world, Theo is mysterious with ESP (extrasensory perception), and Nell, who apparently has psychic abilities (well, she talks to herself in her head a lot) is insecure and feeling like she needs to be there. As time goes by it turns out they are all getting more than they bargained for, starting with loud bangs and voices in the walls for the two girls, the boys seeing and hearing a few things, and even the door wood bending. Nell believes that the spirit of the house wants her to stay, and it almost hypnotises her to do some things, so much so that when the three other people try to get her away, it causes her to crash on purpose, meeting a similar fate to past female residents. Also starring Fay Compton as Mrs. Sanderson, Rosalie Crutchley as Mrs. Dudley, James Bond's Lois Maxwell as Grace Markway, Valentine Dyall as Mr. Dudley, Diane Clare as Carrie Fredericks and Ronald Adam as Eldridge Harper. The performances are all good, the sound effects and occasional small effects do well, but I get the feeling that audiences were much easier to scare back in the 60's, I wasn't really freaked out, I don't fully agree with the five stars the critics give, but it is certainly a classic supernatural horror to try.

It's an alertly smooth display, but it feels like Dudikoff is holding back, not going all the way. Jeff Celentano appears as the unorthodox Capt. 'Wild Bill' Woodward and reminds me off Robert Duvall's Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore from Apocalypse Now. Especially in appearance during the climatic island assault. Don't shoot unless shot at.

My guess is that I am not from the south of European as my friend is. The stereotypes that are exploited here are simply unknown to me, and all the humor depends on exploiting the twinge that real stereotypes elicit. Also, as an American, I get no reward from the knowledge that this is genuinely human from a region that was at the time deep in the most depraved state genocide. The distance between civilization and barbarity in this area of Europe was little more than the distance I often drive to visit a movie theater.Lacking that, what I get is zaniness unconnected to my sense of self and dread. So the zaniness taken out its situation has to stand on its own. It doesn't for me, because it is not handled as a cinematic value, rather just a color, a tone. If you have not seen this, it is a sort of Cannery Row based on the foibles of Balkan Gypsies twisted families, peculiar macho drives, love theft and lies.There are two very lovely things here. One is the liquid environment. The locations and how they are handled is extremely cinematic. Everything is in motion gaggles of birds, other animals, boats on the river, an old gangster in a raggedy vehicle and of course the troop and camera. The fluidity of this is far more valuable than the humor, at least for me.The other lovely thing is a seduction scene that may be one of the most engaging in cinema. A quirky young woman has her eye on a young man. Like all men in this world, he is a nitwit, but is young and clean. She leads him to a field of sunflowers, where she romps while stripping and enticing by running away. Her teasing giggle is profoundly attractive, and I suppose that this one scene must have percolated for a long time. (In all later scenes, the quirkiness of the girl is gone, and she plays simply a love interest.)Oddly, the cats of the title are the clumsiest and least integrated bit.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3 Worth watching.

This is an intelligent woman, so I endured some frustrating months trying to find it in the US, finally to see it on an overseas trip.It wasn't a great experience for me, excepting two elements. My guess is that I am not from the south of European as my friend is. The stereotypes that are exploited here are simply unknown to me, and all the humor depends on exploiting the twinge that real stereotypes elicit. Also, as an American, I get no reward from the knowledge that this is genuinely human from a region that was at the time deep in the most depraved state genocide. The distance between civilization and barbarity in this area of Europe was little more than the distance I often drive to visit a movie theater.Lacking that, what I get is zaniness unconnected to my sense of self and dread. So the zaniness taken out its situation has to stand on its own. It doesn't for me, because it is not handled as a cinematic value, rather just a color, a tone. If you have not seen this, it is a sort of Cannery Row based on the foibles of Balkan Gypsies twisted families, peculiar macho drives, love theft and lies.There are two very lovely things here. One is the liquid environment. The locations and how they are handled is extremely cinematic. Everything is in motion gaggles of birds, other animals, boats on the river, an old gangster in a raggedy vehicle and of course the troop and camera. The fluidity of this is far more valuable than the humor, at least for me.The other lovely thing is a seduction scene that may be one of the most engaging in cinema. A quirky young woman has her eye on a young man. Like all men in this world, he is a nitwit, but is young and clean. She leads him to a field of sunflowers, where she romps while stripping and enticing by running away. Her teasing giggle is profoundly attractive, and I suppose that this one scene must have percolated for a long time.

Most of the conflict and antagonism was rooted from within the Enterprise itself for a lot of Robert Wise's initial adaptation; arriving in the shape of uneasy comings together for an array of multicultural and ethical characters pulling through to save the planet, nicely masking and doubling-up as at once many-an actor's own off screen issues with partaking in said project as well as the necessary unease at venturing out into cinematic territory for the first time. Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan is more interested in other things, namely a stone wall antagonist in the form of the titular Khan meaning action, reaction and conflict on a broader but less complicated scale is the order of the day. The sequel appears to be the more successful of the two films; no surprise, given that by the time it had been made big-budgeted American cinema had somewhat undergone a process of juvenalisation by way of numerous George Lucas and Steven Spielberg projects - audiences falling in accordingly with regards to their relationship towards the two Star Trek films. While it works to a degree, the feeling of the film being reactionary to both that of the first and to that of American films as pieces of 'entertainment' as a whole, is unshakable.William Shatner returns to the role of James Kirk, and following years of weaving in and out of deep space; fighting monsters; touching down on planets and partaking in space combat &#x96; he's beginning to feel his age. When the famous Mr. Spock beamed aboard The Enterprise early on into the first film, reading into Kirk's reaction as one representative of a wider context of not just the character's there in the scene, but Shatner's as well as the watching audience's as a whole, ought not be scoffed at. Furthermore, the interior clashing with the ship's doctor (DeForest Kelley's Bones McCoy) was perhaps representative of the larger extent of disagreements and clashing going on within the project as the Star Trek name was taken down different routes to what is more commonly known. Here, the self-referential content is evident in Kirk feeling his age in that he's old and experienced enough to monitor training programmes; feel nondescript about birthdays and make a clear distinction between what consists of a young and old crew, something that more broadly speaking is representative of Shatner's own experiencing of the entire Star Trek franchise. In doing the television show as well as the first film a few years ago, with all the baggage both before and after that came with Wise's 1979 effort, we've now made it here to the second entry and it seems he's beginning to feel his age too.The film sees Kirk and his crew of the usual suspects do battle against Ricardo Montalban's Khan, and his own crew, whose rough attire and generally unshaven appearance mimic that of their leader; Kirk's smart and much more formal crew thus representative of those of a far more civilised disposition. Khan's titular wrath is one he's been saving for Kirk and The Enterprise and stems from an old back-story involving deception and conflict which ended in the leaving of him for dead on a barren planet of high winds and expansive desert; a locale which has since killed his wife and many of his friends. An interesting political allegory linked to more recent times, namely The Middle East, arrives in the form of Khan; his character, upon the first encounter, quite literally unveils himself by way of peeling back some facial garments which is highly representative of an Islamic sort. His presence in a cinematic space resembling a desert that he inhabits with a large group of guerrilla followers are further items, the being 'left short' by Starfleet and its imperialistic nature even more-so; whereas even his name, Khan, appears to have roots of an Islamic nature further-still based around said area on Earth.The content follows when it transpires Khan wouldn't mind it at all if he got his hands on a piece of equipment called Genesis, eventually rendered somewhat of a MacGuffin, which an isolated space station named Regula I is developing; an operation headed up by one of Kirk's former flames in a certain Carol Marcus (Besch). The item is essentially a WMD, something that is able to wipe out all prior existence on a planet so as to re-tune them to the beholder's new order; in Regular I's case empty, dead planets into plush Edens so that life can flourish - in the hands of Khan, most probably the other way around. The hopping about and gamesmanship by the time Khan is up and airborne is pretty good fun, the film keeping a reign on all the darting around and moulding in the expansion of its characters quite well in that when certain people are in peril or facing death, we care and we're sufficiently enough involved.The Wrath of Khan is most certainly geared more towards action and spectacle as major points of interest rather than ideas and reasoning acting as such; this edition seeing its characters settle things with violence and conflict at the demands of a vengeful character rather than suspicious objects which require inspection and deliberation. It isn't a bad film, just a romping space adventure which doesn't outstay its welcome and does what it needs to do; effectively changing gears when certain dramatic events take centre stage. A digital readout sequence towards the end is a little confusing, in that why it isn't set for the amount of time in seconds it takes to say From Hell's heart, I stab at thee..., I'll never know. Regardless, by the end we've come away feeling fairly nourished; enjoyed the film and if you're as new to Star Trek as I am, pondered where the series might venture next.

While it works to a degree, the feeling of the film being reactionary to both that of the first and to that of American films as pieces of 'entertainment' as a whole, is unshakable.William Shatner returns to the role of James Kirk, and following years of weaving in and out of deep space; fighting monsters; touching down on planets and partaking in space combat &#x96; he's beginning to feel his age. When the famous Mr. Spock beamed aboard The Enterprise early on into the first film, reading into Kirk's reaction as one representative of a wider context of not just the character's there in the scene, but Shatner's as well as the watching audience's as a whole, ought not be scoffed at. Furthermore, the interior clashing with the ship's doctor (DeForest Kelley's Bones McCoy) was perhaps representative of the larger extent of disagreements and clashing going on within the project as the Star Trek name was taken down different routes to what is more commonly known. Here, the self-referential content is evident in Kirk feeling his age in that he's old and experienced enough to monitor training programmes; feel nondescript about birthdays and make a clear distinction between what consists of a young and old crew, something that more broadly speaking is representative of Shatner's own experiencing of the entire Star Trek franchise. In doing the television show as well as the first film a few years ago, with all the baggage both before and after that came with Wise's 1979 effort, we've now made it here to the second entry and it seems he's beginning to feel his age too.The film sees Kirk and his crew of the usual suspects do battle against Ricardo Montalban's Khan, and his own crew, whose rough attire and generally unshaven appearance mimic that of their leader; Kirk's smart and much more formal crew thus representative of those of a far more civilised disposition. Khan's titular wrath is one he's been saving for Kirk and The Enterprise and stems from an old back-story involving deception and conflict which ended in the leaving of him for dead on a barren planet of high winds and expansive desert; a locale which has since killed his wife and many of his friends. An interesting political allegory linked to more recent times, namely The Middle East, arrives in the form of Khan; his character, upon the first encounter, quite literally unveils himself by way of peeling back some facial garments which is highly representative of an Islamic sort. His presence in a cinematic space resembling a desert that he inhabits with a large group of guerrilla followers are further items, the being 'left short' by Starfleet and its imperialistic nature even more-so; whereas even his name, Khan, appears to have roots of an Islamic nature further-still based around said area on Earth.The content follows when it transpires Khan wouldn't mind it at all if he got his hands on a piece of equipment called Genesis, eventually rendered somewhat of a MacGuffin, which an isolated space station named Regula I is developing; an operation headed up by one of Kirk's former flames in a certain Carol Marcus (Besch). The item is essentially a WMD, something that is able to wipe out all prior existence on a planet so as to re-tune them to the beholder's new order; in Regular I's case empty, dead planets into plush Edens so that life can flourish - in the hands of Khan, most probably the other way around. The hopping about and gamesmanship by the time Khan is up and airborne is pretty good fun, the film keeping a reign on all the darting around and moulding in the expansion of its characters quite well in that when certain people are in peril or facing death, we care and we're sufficiently enough involved.The Wrath of Khan is most certainly geared more towards action and spectacle as major points of interest rather than ideas and reasoning acting as such; this edition seeing its characters settle things with violence and conflict at the demands of a vengeful character rather than suspicious objects which require inspection and deliberation. It isn't a bad film, just a romping space adventure which doesn't outstay its welcome and does what it needs to do; effectively changing gears when certain dramatic events take centre stage. A digital readout sequence towards the end is a little confusing, in that why it isn't set for the amount of time in seconds it takes to say From Hell's heart, I stab at thee..., I'll never know.

Most of the conflict and antagonism was rooted from within the Enterprise itself for a lot of Robert Wise's initial adaptation; arriving in the shape of uneasy comings together for an array of multicultural and ethical characters pulling through to save the planet, nicely masking and doubling-up as at once many-an actor's own off screen issues with partaking in said project as well as the necessary unease at venturing out into cinematic territory for the first time.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama"},{"date":"11 November 2010","score":"","review":" I think this was a good movie but some of it was unrealistic. Josh wants to ride a roller coaster, but does not meet the minimum height requirement, so he makes a wish to be big. Josh is supposed to be 12 going on 13. The average height for a 12 year old is about 60 inches. It is very uncommon for a roller coaster to have a minimum height requirement above 54 inches. 54 inches is about average for a 10 year old. Either Josh would need to be extremely short for his age, or the ride would need to have an uncommonly high minimum height requirement. David Moscow did not appear to be under 54 inches tall, so the only implication would be that the ride possibly had a 60 inch minimum height requirement. Very few rides have that kind of height requirement because it would be bad for business. The owners of the amusement parks are well aware that having a height requirement above 54 inches would anger a lot of people, so the biggest minimum height requirement for rides is generally 54 inches or less. Thus, it is highly unlikely that someone who is almost 13 would have a problem getting on a ride at an amusement park. Therefore, the scene where Josh can't get on a ride due to not meeting the height requirement does not seem very realistic. There is the scene where Susan tells Josh that she wants to spend the night at his apartment, but he takes it to mean a sleepover party. Most people at that age would know that the woman is talking about having sex and not a sleepover party. Most 12 and 13 year olds do not play with little kiddie toys. There are some scenes where Josh Baskin acts more like a younger kid rather than a teenager. Josh does not seem like he is interested in doing things that a kids are restricted from. Most teens would jump at the opportunity to participate in adult activities if they had the chance, but Josh opts to participate in kid activities. Most kids are very anxious to drive and would drive at a much earlier age than 16 if it were up to their own free will. I remember at the age of 10 arguing with one of my school teachers about whether I would be capable of driving and being very upset that min age was 16. Most 12 or 13 year olds would be ecstatic if they looked old enough to drive and take advantage of this opportunity. Josh did not show any interest in driving a vehicle. A normal kid that became an adult temporarily would have taken driving lessons, driven a vehicle, then bragged to the other kids about knowing how to drive.There is the scene where Josh plays a person who has just been hit and rolls around on the floor. One of the authors made a comment that a normal kid would argue about whether it was a hit or miss. Though kids do tend to argue with each other, there are some kids that can play games without cheating and have fun. Kids are much less likely to argue with adults than other kids. Even though Josh is a kid, the kids he is playing with would see him as an adult, and be less inclined to argue with him. Thus, Josh would be less inclined to argue with them.Then, there is the part of the movie where Josh blows off his best friend, Billy. His personality changes and he starts acting like the other adults at his work. At that point, Josh loses interest in becoming a child again. Then out of frustration, Billy reminds Josh that he is still a kid and not an adult. At that point, Billy had decided that he wasn't going to bother giving Josh the location of the Zoltar machine. He changes his mind when he sees the anguish Josh's mom is going through over her son being missing and decides to give Josh the location. After doing some thinking, Josh realizes that he is not ready to be an adult yet and decides he wants to go back to being a kid.When Josh tells his girlfriend, Susan, that he is a 13 year old trapped in an adult body, she doesn't believe him. She thinks Josh is just trying to avoid responsibility. Then when she gets to the carnival she seems to realize that Josh was telling her the truth. I suspect that at that point, she actually believed that Josh believed he was a boy, but was delusional. She asked Josh if he was 15 or 16. Josh did not act like he was anywhere close to being 15 or 16. I suspect she wanted Josh to be older, so she would feel better about the relationship she had with him. I think Susan was just going along with what Josh said at the carnival because she knew that Josh truly believed he was a kid trapped in a man's body, but thought he was delusional. I don't think she truly thought he was a kid until she actually saw him change with her own eyes. It must have been a very shocking moment for her. Overall this is a funny movie, and Tom Hanks did do a good job playing an innocent 13 year old trapped inside an adult body. The character had many child like qualities. I suspect there are lots of adults that would like to act like children, but restrain themselves out of fear of embarrassment. The movie basically portrays the message that it is good to be childlike and not take life too seriously.

The plot of a picture like Scarlet Street has been analysed into banality for various psychological readings over the years, but there is little about its story that is unique to what we call film noir. It is in any case a rough remake of the earlier French film La Chienne, itself based on a novel, and a silent American picture called The Whispering Chorus (1918) has many similarities. What is so striking about Scarlet Street, and so many other noirs, is not the themes of the story but the way it is told. Cinema is, after all, about images.A lot of the look of pictures from this time is down to the circumstances of the war, when resources for film making were at a severe low point. Even prestigious wartime productions like For Whom the Bell Tolls and Since You Went Away while epic in length take place on a few small and poorly-lit sets, and aren't exactly bustling with extras. Now take a little production like Scarlet Street which would receive an even smaller allocation, and by necessity you must film it in tiny cramped sets shrouded in darkness, or dark street corners devoid of passers-by. Of course, poverty-row pictures have existed in every era, but I think the thing that distinguishes ones like this is that they worked sensibly within their limited parameters. A B-Western from the 30s or a trashy sci-fi from the 50s would aim high and thus look very cheap. A picture like Scarlet Street aims low and thus looks appropriately atmospheric.If ever there was a director to wring a nightmarish feel from the simplest of elements it was Fritz Lang. He actually makes a virtue of Scarlet Street's low production values, shrouding many of the scenes in a cloak of darkness. Take the squalid bar where the two leads go for their first drink together. The standard way to dress that set would be to fill it with mean-looking riffraff. Instead, dark and all but deserted, it has the atmosphere of a graveyard. And yet Lang's compositions arrange the sparse set decoration into complex patterns, making everywhere look like some horrid maze. Scarlet Street also contains some fine examples of Lang's use of imagery to make us understand a character's mindset. When Edward G. Robinson explains that when he looks at the dilapidated flower he sees the ornate one he has painted, there is an attention-grabbing whip pan to the real flower balanced on the edge of a grimy basin. In the following scene there is a jarring cut as Joan Bennett throws her cigarette in a sink full of dirty crocks. The similarity of these two images, and the way we are made to pay attention to them, gives us a subtle link between Robinson seeing beauty in the wilted flower, and seeing worth in Bennett.It's odd how Lang's pictures normally featured quite overblown hammy performances, whereas here the three main players are all nicely understated. Eddie Robinson, normally a brash wise-cracker, does an excellent and rather poignant job of the sensitive and self-effacing Chris Cross, very subtle and very believable. Joan Bennett is great too, making us believe in both the low-down floozy who loves a gangster and the sweet, innocent lass Robinson worships. And then there is another fabulous turn by Dan Duryea, who always seemed a bit of a caricature because of his mischievous face and sly voice, but could be a very effective villain when he underplayed it, giving the impression of a creepy man who is capable of sinister acts. In fact, Duryea is in constant danger of stealing the picture, and Lang wisely puts his back to the camera in a lot of scenes to stop him upstaging the leads.Of course, the real question is, does all the business of Scarlet Street work? It does indeed. The story may have been old, but this version of it has a unique atmospheric veneer which makes it chill the heart and linger in the mind. This is how great film noir works.

A B-Western from the 30s or a trashy sci-fi from the 50s would aim high and thus look very cheap. A picture like Scarlet Street aims low and thus looks appropriately atmospheric.If ever there was a director to wring a nightmarish feel from the simplest of elements it was Fritz Lang. He actually makes a virtue of Scarlet Street's low production values, shrouding many of the scenes in a cloak of darkness. Take the squalid bar where the two leads go for their first drink together. The standard way to dress that set would be to fill it with mean-looking riffraff. Instead, dark and all but deserted, it has the atmosphere of a graveyard. And yet Lang's compositions arrange the sparse set decoration into complex patterns, making everywhere look like some horrid maze. Scarlet Street also contains some fine examples of Lang's use of imagery to make us understand a character's mindset. When Edward G. Robinson explains that when he looks at the dilapidated flower he sees the ornate one he has painted, there is an attention-grabbing whip pan to the real flower balanced on the edge of a grimy basin. In the following scene there is a jarring cut as Joan Bennett throws her cigarette in a sink full of dirty crocks. The similarity of these two images, and the way we are made to pay attention to them, gives us a subtle link between Robinson seeing beauty in the wilted flower, and seeing worth in Bennett.It's odd how Lang's pictures normally featured quite overblown hammy performances, whereas here the three main players are all nicely understated. Eddie Robinson, normally a brash wise-cracker, does an excellent and rather poignant job of the sensitive and self-effacing Chris Cross, very subtle and very believable. Joan Bennett is great too, making us believe in both the low-down floozy who loves a gangster and the sweet, innocent lass Robinson worships. And then there is another fabulous turn by Dan Duryea, who always seemed a bit of a caricature because of his mischievous face and sly voice, but could be a very effective villain when he underplayed it, giving the impression of a creepy man who is capable of sinister acts. In fact, Duryea is in constant danger of stealing the picture, and Lang wisely puts his back to the camera in a lot of scenes to stop him upstaging the leads.Of course, the real question is, does all the business of Scarlet Street work? It does indeed. The story may have been old, but this version of it has a unique atmospheric veneer which makes it chill the heart and linger in the mind. This is how great film noir works.

After all, the change of scenery in Michael Winterbottom's screen adaptation (here given the more marquee-friendly title 'The Claim') is only geographic, putting a visually restless Western spin on an otherwise typically mannered Old World allegory of guilt and retribution.The title character of Hardy's novel is now a wealthy, influential magnate in a Mother Lode boomtown likely to go bust unless the Central Pacific can lay its proposed trans-continental railway within whistle distance of the mines. His town is named (with undisguised significance) Kingdom Come, and in true literary fashion its leading citizen is hiding a terrible secret.Flashbacks (early enough in the film to not require a spoiler alert) reveal the awful truth as a starving young immigrant he coldly traded his own wife and infant daughter for the lucrative grubstake that would give him all his subsequent prosperity and power. Years later, his dying wife and now grown daughter (the latter ignorant of her pedigree) have returned to Kingdom Come, and their arrival by stagecoach, together with the young engineer from the railroad survey team, is the fateful curtain opener and catalyst for what follows.It sounds compelling, and on a purely cosmetic level the film is a welcome relief from the usual medley of Hollywood sequels, spin-offs, remakes and rip-offs now crowding the nearest multiplex. But somewhere in translation from print to screen some of that dramatic potential was lost, smothered under the too relentlessly grim and oppressive presentation.One hundred and twenty minutes of overcast skies and drifting snows can leave a bitter aftertaste with even the most stalwart viewer, although it needs to be said that the near palpable winter chill is more or less faithful to the spirit of the original novel. According to the Concise Columbia Encyclopedia (a handy one-volume, all-purpose reference guide) Hardy was known for writing generally gloomy, naturalistic studies of character and environment, which is about as tidy a description of the film as anyone could ask for.Paraphrased in less formal vernacular, the gist of it can be summed up even more simply Life stinks &#x96; get used to it. Winterbottom goes out of his way to vividly depict the Old West in all its true, unromantic squalor, creating a ramshackle plywood metropolis populated by a rootless community of bickering whores, drunken miners, unlucky gamblers, and other assorted vagabonds on the muddy road to El Dorado. Even the more lavish boudoir of the local nabobs ('mayor' Peter Mullen and his 'Portuguese' mistress Milla Jovovich) is under lit to the same shabby monochrome.Add some fashionably sloppy cinema veritè camera-work and the result is a handsome but frigid retro-70s downer, heavily in debt to Robert Altman's 'McCabe and Mrs. Miller' but conspicuously lacking Altman's anti-Hollywood iconoclasm (not to mention Warren Beatty's marquee value charisma). Winterbottom certainly deserves a round of applause for at least attempting to de-glamorize the traditional silver screen whitewash of frontier life. But despite the rich texture of the period detail he still can't resist putting a halfway romantic halo around the raw vulgarity of his setting. Maybe it's an unavoidable side effect to spinning a Western tall tale. Heck, even Sam Peckinpah's 'Wild Bunch' had their moments of misty-eyed, sloppy macho sentimentality.You can see it here in the majestic alpine scenery, meant to be California but shot (somewhat obviously, to this displaced Westerner) in the more visually epic Canadian and Colorado Rockies. (A quick historical nitpick the California gold rush took place in the lower Sierra Nevada foothills, nowhere near the timberline location of Kingdom Come.) You can see it also in the glistening teeth and glowing complexion of Wes Bentley and Sarah Polley, looking perhaps too fresh and contemporary against the mid 19th century grubbiness of their surroundings.Bentley is the young survey engineer attracted to Polley, the unsuspecting long-lost daughter of town boss Peter Mullen. And it shouldn't surprise anyone to find their budding relationship given center stage over what should have been the real meat of the scenario the troubled reconciliation between a conscience-stricken Mullen and his estranged, dying wife, played by Nastassja Kinski.Maybe it wasn't written like this, but somewhere in the editing room the focus shifted away from the tragic consequences of Mullen's Faustian bargain, upsetting the already lopsided narrative balance in favor of the (more photogenic) younger actors. Consider it a token olive branch extended to an audience asked to endure a long, cold, and otherwise uninvolving drama.Bentley himself is allowed the final, inexplicably optimistic epitaph, after the town of Kingdom Come, and the compromised reign of its founding father, have both achieved their (not unpredictable) fiery purgation. They're like kings, he tells Polley, gazing in awestruck admiration at the gray parade of pioneers bringing civilization to the untamed American wilderness. Nobody mentions the fact that all this activity is at the compulsion (and to the ultimate profit) of the railroad monopolies, but never mind.

Screenwriter Laurence Coriat claims that his script was influenced by Robert Altman's Short Cuts, and it shows, the film bouncing deftly from one character to the next, but finding only misery, loneliness and grief. Stylistically Winterbottom is attempting to merge the gritty aesthetic of the kitchen-sink and British New Wave dramas of the 1960s, with the jazzy styles of Hong Kong cinema and contemporary music videos. Call this hip sink drama, Winterbottom using hand held cameras, 16mm film, frenetic location shooting, improvisational dialogue etc and colliding them all with Phillip Nyman's modern score, lots of dramatic slow-motion sequences, and countless shots of London's gorgeous, sparkly lights. Look closer, though, and it's apparent that the film is simply a big bag of dressed up clichés. The kitchen-sink and New Wave dramas of the 60s all aimed at social change, had a political function and attempted to shed light on an underclass that had been ignored. And so one has to ask why exactly is Winterbottom interested in reviving this aesthetic? One sees the moral outrage he invests into pictures like In This World and The Road To Guantanamo, applying kitchen sink to tales of subjugated foreigners, but Wonderland, which focuses on embittered Londoners, seems less interested in making any point or than it is in homaging, resurrecting and updating the British New Wave. So it's no surprise that behind Winterbottom's technique we find only clichés and contrivances. Take, for example, one sequence in which an estranged couple bump into one another at a hospital, their miraculous meeting allowing them to reconcile their problems. This isn't realism, it's a contrivance typical of a slick Sandra Bullock romantic comedy. Every other realistic subplot in the film is similarly generic, characters dovetailing far too conveniently and character arcs unfolding in unsurprising ways. So while Wonderland's aesthetic may be gritty, it's actually populated by stock soap opera characters and packed with clichés, its edgy and naturalistic surface obscuring a fairly old fashioned tear-jerker which simply goes through the motions toward a predictable outcome. And yet...if the core of the picture doesn't work, its edges are positively amazing. Actress Gina McKee invests one character, Nadia, with angelic grace, and Peter Greenaway's favourite minimalist composer, Michael Nyman, serves up a beautiful score, his repetitions of graceful epiphanies suggesting that passions swirl even within mundane lives.More importantly, what the film does better than any other film in recent memory is capture the beauty, energy, ugliness and brutality of London. Like Altman's A Prairie Home Companion, Winterbottom's aesthetic captures the romantic glow of street lights, the sparkle of car headlamps, the cosy bloom of coffee houses, the snaking tails of traffic, the muted warmth of diners, the buzz of companionship, but then clashes the city's romantic glow, its restless buzz, with London's cold inhospitality; the alienation, drudgery and squalor of the grey beast. Few films capture the contradictions of modern London.So again, comparisons to Altman's A Prairie Home Companion (he's one of Winterbottom's favourite directors) are apt, as Altman's film sets up a series of paradisaical enclaves of warmth, light and shelter, only to then collided them all with the existential horror of a wild, inhospitable outdoors. Both films are thus about a kind of beautiful hell, where only the lights of a diner and the promise of connection help hold back the night. But whilst Altman found some semblance of hope and respite, Winterbottom depicts something far more grim. Respite here is seen to be a sham (trips to plush hotels etc), social gatherings (fireworks displays and football games) lead not to participation but mask only further desperation, and our cast of Londoners seem forever chained economically and without spirituality or direction.

Basically three successful film industry members, actress Georgia Lorrison (Lana Turner), director Fred Amiel (Barry Sullivan) and writer James Lee Bartlow (Dick Powell) are brought together by friend Harry Pebbel (Walter Pidgeon). Pebbel wants them to reminisce about their time spent with ambitious Hollywood producer and director Jonathan Shields (Oscar nominated Kirk Douglas).

Georgia was an up and coming unknown star and was given her first major movie star role with the help of Shields, and it turns into a good social and professional relationship, until he pursues other women. Amiel was working with Shields as director on many pictures, but then the producer starts taking more control and wants other people to take Amiel's dream project.

However, in typical form, Allen proves far more interested in pursuing his own whimsical train of thought and interest than pursuing a topic along conventional expectations, opting for a 'musical' more reflexive about the role of the musical as a genre than concentrating on itself as a new entry into the genre. The result, Everyone Says I Love You, subsequently proves to be one of Allen's most silly, experimental, self-indulgent, and yet delightfully enjoyable films.While initial inspection would find criticism in the lacklustre singing and dancing efforts of his primary cast, it becomes clear over time than Allen's film attempts to harness the inspirational impact of the musical and the role it plays within the lives of the general public, particularly as a tool for inner expression. Through intentionally casting 'non-singers' (rumour has it than Allen neglected to inform any of the cast the film was a musical until after they were cast), the film achieves a naturalistic feel, as if providing real people with the sudden opportunity for cathartic song and dance in a way excluded from 'real life', thus exposing them and their inner workings as characters. And it is this methodology that brings the film to life, providing a unique spin on an otherwise familiar Allen narrative of a web of quirky yet credible individuals weaving in and out of each other's lives and relationships, suggesting the fluidity of romance and human nature. However, as always, Allen is less interested in ascribing judgement on his characters as simply observing them in action (although there is an amusingly tongue-in-cheek subplot satirizing the film's young republican character which unwinds in a hilariously contentious fashion). Everyone Says I Love You ends up exploring the inevitability of the contradictions and lapses in judgement of human nature, leaving each new weave of the plot largely bereft of directorial moral guiding and all the more human because of it. Though the title may suggest a comment on the devaluing of emotional excesses regarding love, Allen's film never trivializes or languishes on love, but merely presents it as a universal human concern, his fluffy approach belying a more credibly sweet interior (the film's ending riverside dance sequence stands out as one of the more quiet, poignant and beautiful climaxes in recent cinema). That said, the film at heart remains more of an experimental exploration than firmly quality film, as Allen's script lacks the zing and wit of many of his more assured works, lagging somewhat midway through, and the entire film has a highly cobbled together, incohesive and somewhat amateurish feel (whether or not this fits with Allen's intent at naturalism remains up for debate). In addition, Allen sometimes gets a little too silly for his own good (a song and dance number with ghosts in a funeral home is really pushing it), though he never quite gets carried away enough to lose track of his intent or film as a singular entity.Regardless of what they may lack in vocal credentials, the film's cast certainly excels in terms of performance. Drew Barrymore masters the sweetness, innocence yet unpredictability of a somewhat naïve young woman in love, and Edward Norton is a scream as her thoroughly wholesome yet vaguely self-centred fiancé (their prospective engagement scene in a restaurant, with Norton essaying his best neurotic Allen impression in the midst of growing chaos, is likely the film's most hilarious moment). Allen himself finds an entirely appropriate role for himself without taking over the narrative, toning down his eccentricities for the role of a man attempting to reconstruct his entire life in the image of his prospective lover's ideals, and is fully convincing and lovably pathetic in the process. As said romantic interest, Julia Roberts is left with little material to work with, but channels a fitting sense of grounded yearning nonetheless. Alan Alda is hilarious as the central family's sweetly outspoken patriarch, threatening to steal the show on multiple occasions, Goldie Hawn is somewhat underused yet both witty and touching as his wife (and Allen's ex-wife). Tim Roth steals the show with a far too brief part as an unbalanced, recently released convict, and a young Natalie Portman excels at credibly conveying teenage yearning for love without lapsing into cliché. While an undeniably whimsical entry into the Allen canon, Everyone Says I Love You remains a thought-provoking and thoroughly charming (albeit somewhat clumsy) film easily worth experiencing for those beguiled by musicals as much as musical lovers.-8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"11 November 2010","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" As an incredible affinity with nostalgic populism has been a recurring theme throughout his expansive career, the melding of a 1930s inspired musical and Woody Allen does not seem to be as unorthodox an idea as one might expect.
