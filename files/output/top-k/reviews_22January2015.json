It's a movie about high school football which is pretty much like every other movie about high school football. Every cliché of the genre is here. The overbearing coach. The football-obsessed town. The parents living vicariously through their children. The players who see football as their only means of escape. The intellectual player who realizes there's more to life than football. The cheerleader who just wants to be with the star, whoever the star may be at a given moment. The big, fat guy who's there for comic relief. The injury that changes everything. The big game at the end. Did I miss any? Oh yes, of course, the biggest cliché of all...Texas. Where else would you set a movie about a town where high school football is the only thing that matters?So you know what you're in for with this movie. Nothing is going to surprise you here. But as predictable and formulaic as it is Varsity Blues still provides reasonably decent entertainment. The characters may all be clichéd but a number of them still manage to be compelling. James Van Der Beek is the star of the movie, if not the football team. He plays the intellectual backup quarterback, Mox, a guy who plays football not because he wants to but because it is what he is expected to do. Mox's situation changes, how Mox responds to that change is the crux of the movie's rather simple story. Van Der Beek's performance is by no means extraordinary but for this movie it works perfectly fine. He creates a character we can relate to and root for. And Jon Voight, playing the thoroughly detestable Coach Bud Kilmer, does an excellent job creating a character we can despise and root against. Kilmer is a hard-driving jerk, a man who cares only about winning football games. He cares not how many young bodies he must destroy to win another district championship. The conflict between Mox, who gets what life is really about, and Kilmer, who most certainly does not, is quite dramatic. And if a high school football movie can give you some good drama that's really all you can ask. There is nothing spectacular about Varsity Blues. There is nothing that really sets it apart from all the other movies of its type you have already seen. But it is at least entertaining enough to be worth your while. There are good dramatic moments, a few good laughs, some compelling characters. And some rather inventively used whipped cream. It may not rise above its genre but for what it is, and all it was ever meant to be, Varsity Blues is a success.

It is Arnold in the main role, and not just any Arnold but a relatively early Arnold, so his acting leaves much to be desired, his charm notwithstanding. He is not the worst however. Some actors got even poorer and more poorly dubbed lines attached to them. The boy at the beginning of the film does not say anything at all, just stares all confused, even when his most beloved ones die. Someone forgot to tell this kid to begin acting.However, this movie does the smart thing by limiting the amount of dialogue for those who cannot act and saving the speeches for those who can James Earl Jones, Max von Sydow and Mako Iwamatsu.Now we come to the most painful part of the film. The writing can be pretty good but there is a lot in this movie that either does not make much sense, is unintentionally funny or just plain stupid. Quite a few scenes, although have a point and purpose to them, contain nonsensical events. Conan wraps a fur around a naked woman but then immediately takes it off. Then for some reason he decides that a random dead guy in a cave is his God. A woman helps him only to immediately try and kill him. And the dialogue&#x85;oh dear. The creators actually try to make the phrase You wanna live forever? a catch phrase for one of the characters. Stupid dialogue contrasts strongly with some really good lines from James Jones' villain, Thulsa Doom.There are a number of things about the story that are good. There is more to this movie than just a collection of action scenes. There is a theme about the power of mind body versus the power of weapons and about blindly following leaders. The story is not too formulaic. For example although the movie does have a romantic interest for Conan, she does not start like a typical lady character and does not play out like one. And despite the odd writing for certain scenes and dialogue there is an overall structure to the story that makes sense and flows well.The art in this film is epic and it is what defines this film. Misty forests, snowy mountains, deserts and huge sets combined with some of the best costume design create an unforgettable looking film. Those outfits are really something with the big fur mixed with leather, Nordic runes and Arnold's glistening muscles. A lot of these costumes look like one of a kind and it seems that Conan himself carries a whole wardrobe because he is in something new every day.The weapons can get a chapter of their own. They are important to the story so care was taken with their appearance. Conan's sword has become a recognizable icon, but there are also various Asian fist blades and bows.The best thing however that really makes this film for me is its music. There may be a little too much of it. It cannot help itself but play over everything, pumping on and on, but it can stay as long as it wants as far as I am concerned. String section, French Horns, piercing trumpets and the everlasting heavy thundering base drums come together to make this film feel truly epic. The main theme for this movie ended up on my mp3 player, then in my custom soundtrack for Elder Scrolls Morrowind and the subsequent Elder Scrolls games. When those drums start roaring, I know right away where I am - in the far away steppes, with the wind on my left shoulder and my sword on my right shoulder.Despite its flaws Conan the Babarian is one of my favorite movies of all time. The things that are bad about it are entertainingly bad and the entertaining things are properly entertaining. As soon as you start buckling under the poor dialogue, the movie throws a great looking scenery with an epic theme at you and sucks you right back on board. It is largely about the adventure atmosphere brought on by the great looks and music. This movie could have easily been a really bad adventure film, but it ended up in the right hands and it shines. It has so much character. It is an eternal dragon breathing fire. I am in awe of this movie's art and feel of adventure.Please be aware that while there may be women who will like this, at its core this is a very male-oriented movie. Those biceps are not flexing for the ladies. This is a power-fantasy movie through and through, power-porn if you will.

On the positive side, Lee is very intimidating as the towering mummy and Cushing always makes for a worthy protagonist. In addition George Pastell is effective as the offended Egyptian and Yvonne Furneaux as Isobel\/Ananka is stunning, although they don't do enough with her; in fact, her role is limited to portions of the last act.So what's the problem? For one, the entire first act takes place in Egypt, but it's an indoor set in England and looks like it. Remember those cheesy studio sets of the original Star Trek TV series? The Egyptian sets in this movie aren't much better -- the outside sets, that is; the tomb sets are actually good. Speaking of the tomb sets, how is it that there's proper lighting in a tomb that's been shut for 3000 years? It's never explained. Roll-your-eyes factors like this don't make for good movies. Thankfully, the locations switch to England in the second act.Secondly, there's just too much Egyptian ritual and citation of sacred scrolls. Some of this is understandable, of course, but there's so much in the movie that it feels like it's padded by at least 12 minutes. Lastly, it doesn't make sense that the Egyptian guy is adamant about having the mummy slay Cushing's character because he was laid-up in a tent when the tomb of Ananka was desecrated. He justifies it on the grounds that Cushing was a member of the party that broke into the crypt, but it just doesn't seem like he has a good enough reason to go through all the trouble when Cushing wasn't even near the tomb. Also, why not go after all the workers that helped the team break into the forbidden crypt?

On the positive side, Lee is very intimidating as the towering mummy and Cushing always makes for a worthy protagonist. In addition George Pastell is effective as the offended Egyptian and Yvonne Furneaux as Isobel\/Ananka is stunning, although they don't do enough with her; in fact, her role is limited to portions of the last act.So what's the problem? For one, the entire first act takes place in Egypt, but it's an indoor set in England and looks like it. Remember those cheesy studio sets of the original Star Trek TV series? The Egyptian sets in this movie aren't much better -- the outside sets, that is; the tomb sets are actually good. Speaking of the tomb sets, how is it that there's proper lighting in a tomb that's been shut for 3000 years? It's never explained. Roll-your-eyes factors like this don't make for good movies. Thankfully, the locations switch to England in the second act.Secondly, there's just too much Egyptian ritual and citation of sacred scrolls. Some of this is understandable, of course, but there's so much in the movie that it feels like it's padded by at least 12 minutes. Lastly, it doesn't make sense that the Egyptian guy is adamant about having the mummy slay Cushing's character because he was laid-up in a tent when the tomb of Ananka was desecrated. He justifies it on the grounds that Cushing was a member of the party that broke into the crypt, but it just doesn't seem like he has a good enough reason to go through all the trouble when Cushing wasn't even near the tomb. Also, why not go after all the workers that helped the team break into the forbidden crypt? Why just go after the white dudes?The film runs 86 minutes and was shot in England.GRADE C ","genre":"Adventure, Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"22 January 2015","score":"","review":" While I have been aware of this title I never saw the movie, until today that is, when it was shown on the Movies! channel. I am roughly the same age as all the actors here, who were mostly mid- to late- 20s when it was filmed. I remember the 1950s and much of what is shown in this movie is fairly authentic to that time.Those of us who take achievement for granted, simply go to school and college, behave in class, do assignments, make good grades, get married, raise a family, have a decent career ... we don't really get how the others waste the same opportunities. And that is the focus of this movie. The boys call themselves the Lord's (yes, it is incorrect) and they fashion themselves as a gang of four. But they aren't really vicious, they do get into small fights, they do steal a car for the night, but no major crimes. They are depicted mostly as teenagers with no focus, no rudder, no concept of what they want their lives to become. They want the girls, and one gets one by virtue of an unplanned pregnancy, but most good girls avoid them because, while they are cute and personable, they look and act like losers. And most girls don't want to get attached to losers.It is fun to see actors like Perry King, Sylvester Stallone, and Henry Winkler in their earlier days. In fact the best scene is in a pool hall when Stallone's girlfriend comes in to tell him she is pregnant and he just isn't prepared to deal with it. He might have made mostly cheesy movies but we can see that he really was a fine actor. He makes that scene work.Shot mostly in Brooklyn it is an interesting glimpse into that time but overall not a particularly good movie.

Although not as good as Braveheart, it is better than Pearl Harbor and We Were Soldiers. It has a great cast; it is amazing that Jeremy Irons, DiCaprio, John Malkovich and Gerard Deperdieu were able to all star in the same movie. However, I have always been a History fan; and the IMDb profile claims that I like biography, history and war movies above all. Perhaps such a bias causes me to give this film a more generous rating.One thing the film did is to cause me to question issues of legitimacy. The film is, of course, not historically accurate. It is obviously romanticized. But in real life, there had actually been a man in the Iron Mask in the Bastille prison. In real life, there had been tension between Jesuits and kings. And the movie alludes to events that would later portend the French Revolution (i.e. starving hordes in Paris). In real life, King Louis XIV also declared himself to be in charge of the French Royal Council in 1661; and the film starts off in 1662. The very fact that a 'bad' king is replaced by a 'good' king may be a reference to the latent belief (at least on the part of Alexandre Dumas) that Louis XIV had been corrupt and that so had been his Royal Council. After all, Wikipedia claimed that Louis XIV's reign had actually not been peaceful during the later part of his years.However, the film was enjoyable. After watching the 1994 Disney version of the Three Musketeers as a kid years ago, it was interesting to see the Three Musketeers again in their older years. And just because they were older obviously did not mean they did not have problems. In fact, the film demonstrates the reality that their lives had gotten more difficult. The film also touches on other important issues that may cause heated debates. The film seemed to argue that the wars fought consumed the resources of the French peasants and urban workers. Rather than competing over scarce resources, the countries engaged in war fought for glory and ideological reasons. This may be true, but I'm not sure to what degree it is also a romanticized notion. Historians will probably duke it out.I would recommend this film and would even do so for those who are not fans of history.8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"22 January 2015","score":"","review":" This is one of Randall Wallace's better movies.

Indeed, he even considered shutting down the animation studios altogether before he was rescued by the unlikeliest of machines - a photocopier. Armed with this new technology, Walt could rapidly reproduce animation cels at a fraction of the cost. There was, sadly, a trade-off as the quality of reproductions wasn't that great and left everything with a grainy black outline. This is why the original 101 Dalmatians looks the way it does but it is a shock to the system considering the beautiful fluidity the earlier films contained. Combining this with the fact that the story and characters aren't especially memorable and it's perhaps not surprising that the film's one true lasting legacy is in the shape of the movie's legendary baddie.Lonely Pongo (voiced by the late Rod Taylor) yearns for some company for both himself and his owner, struggling song writer Roger (Ben Wright). After spotting fellow Dalmatian Perdita (Cate Bauer) in the park, Pongo contrives to get Roger to meet her owner Anita (Lisa Davis). After Roger and Anita marry, it isn't long before puppies are on the way and Pongo and Perdita become proud parents to fifteen puppies. But their happy home life is shattered by Anita's old school friend Cruella De Vil (Betty Lou Gerson) who has plans for the helpless puppies and together with bumbling crooks Horace (Frederick Worlock) and Jasper (J. Pat O'Malley), conspires to steal them. After the police turn up empty-handed, Pongo and Perdita realise that it's up to them to get their litter of puppies back.It isn't just the story which is barking in 101 Dalmatians. None of the characters really make much of an impact, meaning that the already-weak story hasn't much impetus to it and my attention often wandered during the film. The one exception is the delightfully devilish Cruella, who has become an iconic creation thanks to the wonderful performance by Gerson. The animation also helps - her cigarette's billowing green smoke and her grayish skin make her stand out from the others on screen. Looking at it, it would appear that most animators concentrated on the characters instead of the backgrounds. Some scenes use that horrible technique of simply colouring in sections of the background, giving the film a weirdly stark and indistinct feel. There just isn't as much colour or magic as there is in Disney's earlier films and it makes 101 Dalmatians a difficult film to love.I realise that I might be in the minority but I prefer the live-action remake from 1996. Glenn Close can't quite match the manic madness of Gerson's Cruella (though she's still excellent) but in every other respect, that movie trumps this one. Real dogs will always be cuter than animated ones and Horace & Jasper's bickering sideshow is also more entertaining. But this earlier film still has its merits and its fans - understandable if you've grown up with it. I just wished that it didn't look and feel as cheap as it does because with more effort and energy, this might have been one of Disney's classics. But it simply isn't on a par with the likes of Dumbo, Pinocchio or the animated sequence from Mary Poppins and typifies the occasional laziness of the Disney studio. Even the most ardent of Disney fans will acknowledge that they have a long list of half-hearted films on their CV along with the classics and for me, 101 Dalmatians is somewhere in between.

Me and some friends decided to start Watching some horror films and someone had to search for good ones. So I searched and searched lists and forums and movie sites to clear out which were described as really scary and which were more of a comedy horror than a scary one. Then I found the great Session 9, no one had nothing bad to say, IMDb gives it 6,5 a very good grade for a horror film as even the best out there don't get more than 7,5. The story? Some cleaning crew closes a great deal to clean up an abandoned asylum (bigger than Hogwarts ) in one week. I said OK that's a great promise, some scary stuff are gonna happen to them.

","genre":"Horror, Mystery"},{"date":"22 January 2015","score":"","review":" Alfred Hitchcock never made sequels to any of his films, which is perhaps not surprising as most of them do not lend themselves to the sequelisation process. The characters at the centre of his films are not action heroes like James Bond, Dirty Harry or Indiana Jones whom one can imagine going from one adventure to another. They are generally ordinary men and women who, through some twist of fate, find themselves caught up in extraordinary events. (John Buchan, the author of The 39 Steps, was to reintroduce its hero, Richard Hannay, in several more novels, but Hitchcock makes him much more of a Mr Average than he was in the original, and never made another film featuring Hannay). The films normally end with the hero and heroine safe and the villains dead or in police custody. It would be hard to imagine what purpose might have been served by, say, a North by North-West II or a The Lady Vanishes Again. Even when one of his films- e.g. The Birds- finished on an ambiguous note, Hitch preferred not to repeat himself.Even after Hitchcock's death, later directors have generally followed his lead and have not made sequels to his films. Psycho, however, is the great exception. Between 1983 and 1990 there were no fewer than three sequels named (without any great effort at originality) Psycho II, Psycho III and Psycho IV.Psycho II is set 22 years after the events of the first film. It opens with Norman Bates being ruled sane and released from the mental institution in which he has been incarcerated. He returns to his old house and the Bates Motel which has continued in business under new management, although Norman remains the legal owner. He finds a job working in a diner. Doubts start to emerge, however, as to whether he really has recovered his sanity. In a moral sense, certainly, he seems sane enough. He recognises his responsibility for his crimes and knows that killing people is wrong. He appears, however, still to be suffering from delusions, believing that he is receiving communications from his long- dead mother. He wonders whether some person is deliberately trying to drive him mad again. There are two obvious suspects. One is Lila Loomis (nee Crane), the sister of his victim Marion Crane, who has been leading a vociferous campaign against his release. The other is Warren Toomey, the manager of the motel, whom Norman sacked for tolerating drug taking on the premises. Norman makes a new friend in Mary, an attractive young co-worker at the diner- but is she really what she claims to be?The original Psycho is widely regarded, with justification, as one of Hitchcock's greatest works, so the idea of an unauthorised sequel will doubtless strike many as an unwelcome impertinence. (Something borne out by a number of the comments on here). I can, however, understand why this film was made. Norman Bates is probably Hitchcock's most memorable villain, and, moreover, is one of the few who does not end up dead by the end of the film. He must have seemed too good to restrict to a single film.Most of the target audience would already have been familiar with the first film, so merely repeating its plot by allowing Norman to return as a murderous killer would not have worked. The film-makers had to find a way of recapturing the suspense of the original, and they do this by offering us a Norman who is the same as the original and yet different, who is middle-aged rather than young, who is battling to retain his sanity and, most importantly, is now the victim of other people's malice rather than the villain. Anthony Perkins was persuaded to return as Norman, and it is a measure of his acting skills that he is able to cope with the difficult challenges of playing a character who is the same as, yet different from, one whom he created more than twenty years earlier and of arousing sympathy for a man who has committed several murders. Vera Miles also returns from the first film, and her character is also completely changed. Lila, originally a resourceful young heroine, here becomes a vindictive harpy. There is another good performance from Meg Tilly as the troubled Mary.Director Richard Franklin also pays tribute to Hitchcock's original by frequent references to it. There is, for example, a shower scene and a scene where a car is winched out of the swamp. I felt that the film would have worked better in black-and white- the old Bates house never looks quite so eerie in colour- but the use of colour was probably inevitable. Even in the early sixties monochrome was on its way out- Psycho was to be Hitchcock's last black-and-white film- and by 1983 the studios were reluctant to use it except for works by a few established auteur directors like Martin Scorsese (Raging Bull) and Woody Allen (Manhattan).The film never really reaches the level of the first Psycho, but then Hitchcock set a very high standard and it would have been unrealistic to expect Franklin to have bettered it. Seen as a thriller in its own right, Psycho II works well enough. 6\/10A goof. We learn that Mary is the daughter of Lila and Sam Loomis, but would Vera Miles and John Gavin really have had a daughter who looked like Meg Tilly, who is half Chinese?

All of those elements make Fright Night not only a Cult Classic but also one of the best Horror films of the 1980s.Fright Night tells the story of Charley Brewster(William Ragsdale),a teenager who discovers that his next door neighbor Jerry Dandridge(Chris Sarandon)is a vampire that's killing people but Charley can't prove it because no one believes him. Running out of options,Charley turns to Horror actor and Television host Peter Vincent(Roddy McDowall)for help and to take down Jerry Dandridge.During the big and successful Horror movie boom of the 1980s the Vampire genre was making a comeback and during the comeback they're were three Vampire films that were true standouts and in my opinion The Big Three Vampire films of the 1980s such as Joel Shmumacher's excellent and thrilling The Lost Boys(1987),Kathryn Bigelow's brilliant and unforgettable Near Dark(also in 1987)and last but not least Tom Holland's Fright Night(1985),an outstanding and entertaining Horror\/Comedy that was a Box office success,but also became a Cult Classic and is one of the most memorable Horror movies of the 1980s. From beginning to end Fright Night is an amazing Horror film that is the true definition of a thrill ride and is a movie that strikes a wonderful balance between suspense and laughs giving viewers a fun movie that is gripping and funny but doesn't take itself to seriously and where everything just works. Where as The Lost Boys and Near Dark were films that took Vampire movies into new directions Writer-Director Tom Holland gives Fright Night a classic,old school tone taking the style and influences of the Universal Horror movies of the 1930s and 40s as well as the Hammer films of the 1950s and 60s and puts the style into a modern day setting(circa 1985)that makes the movie feel fresh and creative while still giving viewers all of the known and familiar trademarks of the Vampire genre(crosses,sunlight etc.). What I also enjoy about Fright Night is that despite being set in the 1980s there is a timeless feeling to the movie where it feels like the story could've taken place in any decade or anytime. Another thing that makes Fright Night so great is that the movie never says where in what City,Town or state this movie takes place in. Is it in the big cities of Los Angeles or New York or in a small town in the Midwest? It's a question that will never be answered and one of the best things about the film. The main characters in Fright Night(Charley Brewster,Jerry Dandridge,Peter Vincent,Amy,Evil Ed)in Fright Night are all memorable and fascinating and are given enough screen time to make the movie more intense,wild and funny with a lot of over the top moments. The Comedy and Humor in Fright Night is funny and smart thanks to Holland's great screenplay which is filled with clever dialog and moments as well as nods to Horror films and actors of the past(the character Peter Vincent is named after genre icons Vincent Price and Peter Cushing). While Fright Night isn't a serious Horror film there are plenty of moments of atmosphere and terror thanks to the Vampire moments and the atmosphere with the smoke and lighting that is around long enough to put viewers on the edge of their seats. Horror and Humor go together well in this film. While Fright Night isn't very gory or bloody there are a few moments in the movie where blood and goo comes out and it is effective. The ending of Fright Night is sensational and intense with tons of special effects and moments of insanity and mayhem that just never stops. A fantastic conclusion.The cast is wonderful. Chris Sarandon is excellent and unforgettable as Jerry Dandridge,one of the greatest Vampire characters in the history of Horror films. Sarandon is charismatic,mysterious and suave commands the film every time he's on screen. William Ragsdale is terrific as Charley Brewster,the hero of the film. Roddy McDowall is brilliant and at his best as Peter Vincent,a Horror actor and television host. Amanda Bearse(of Married...With Children fame)is amusing and cute as Amy,Charley's girlfriend. Stephen Geoffreys is fantastic and hilarious as Evil Ed,Charley's quirky best friend. Jonathan Stark is great as Billy Cole,Jerry's assistant. Dorothy Fielding(Judy Brewster)and Art Evans(Detective Lennox)give good performances as well.The direction by Tom Holland is outstanding,with Holland always moving the camera and giving the movie a haunting and beautiful style and look to the film. Great direction,Holland.The score by Brad Fiedel is sensational,haunting,memorable and matches the tone of the movie perfectly. Amazing score,Fiedel.

I finally watched Die Hard last Christmas and I have to say that I found it incredibly entertaining! 80's action films are usually corny and cheesy, Die Hard did have its one liners and many cliché moments but it had so much more than that. It has depth, it has characters that you care about, characters that you can connect to and genuinely tense moments that don't feel forced. Die Hard is set in a multi storey office tower, it's Christmas Eve and an office party is in full swing. John McClane (Bruce Willis) is visiting his wife there as the office is held hostage by terrorists looking to get rich and get out. John McClane is out of the terrorists sights as they gather the hostages and takes it upon himself to bring them down one by one, on his own. Die Hard is essentially an 80's style, adrenaline fuelled game of cat and mouse. A dozen terrorists against an off duty cop, 30 floors up in a half renovated tower block!I am not the biggest fan of Bruce Willis but I must say I did like him in Die Hard, it is by far his strongest performance and he certainly plays to his strengths. Alan Rickman gives a fantastic performance as Hans Gruber, the leader of the terrorist group. He is intense and intimidating and has a real presence when he is on screen. He isn't your stereotypical villain and I think this is what makes his performance so special.You must remember that this is an 80's action flick so expect the cliché scenarios, the one liners, the explosions and the 'as if you could do that' moments.

Every now and then, though, sometimes Hollywood gets it right a second time. 1992's Home Alone 2 Lost in New York is one such case. Taking place one year after the events in the first film, the cast once again includes the charming Macaulay Culkin as that devilish but lovable Kevin McCallister and pretty much everyone else, from Catherine O'Hara as the mother, to Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern as the bungling thieves Harry and Marv. Once again the family is readying for another Christmas trip, this time to Miami, and like the first one, the alarm doesn't go off when it's supposed and it's a mad rush to the airport. Only this time, instead of leaving Kevin behind, Kevin manages to get to the airport but alas gets on the wrong flight after following a man who has the same coat, same hair style from the back as his father does! As you can probably guess from the title, Kevin ends up in New York, checks into the fancy Plaza Hotel with his dad's credit card (Were we are treated to a cameo from the Donald himself, Mr. Donald Trump, the owner of the hotel at the time) and living the dream. However, he won't be able to rest for long; Harry and Marv have busted out of prison and they decide to go to (Where else?) New York. Of course, it means another Christmas in the trenches as Kevin must prevent the two heartless but dimwitted thieves from knocking off a toy store whose proceeds are to go to the children's hospital. Can Kevin win again or are the tables to be turned?Although it may not be quite on the same level as the first one, I can honestly say I have just as much fun watching Home Alone 2 every year as I do the original. A big reason for this is probably due to the return of almost all the cast members, and I do mean almost everyone, from John Heard as the father to Gerry Bamman as the much hated Uncle Frank. Another reason is the return of Chris Columbus as director, whose shots of New York are as dazzling and enchanting as those in the first one. Indeed, Central Park has rarely been filmed as beautifully as it is here. Plus, the script is once again written by the late, great John Hughes, which means the story has plenty of laughs in addition to heart. True, the skits in this one are a bit more outrageous than in the original (In one scene, the film asks us to believe that a person, in this case Marv, can be hit with multiple bricks from a five story window and not suffer death or permanent brain damage!). However, folks, considering that this is a holiday comedy, I don't think it's too much to ask that we suspend our disbelief just a little. As for the music score, once again the legendary John Williams does his magic, producing what could be an even better score than the first, including new songs like the heart tugging Christmas Star, one of the most beautiful and underrated Christmas songs ever. In many ways, you could say Home Alone 2 is remake of the first one, only one that retains both the comedy and magic of the original version (Something that can't be said for any of the ones that followed it!). So, with all that said, gather around children and watch that most rarity of rarities, a truly magical sequel in the form of Home Alone 2 Lost in New York.

It was a celebration of the hard truths of life and the love and strength we all need to get through them. CONS There is a graphic rape scene.Why. Why is there a graphic rape scene.Why do he have the main character - the narrator - chase down a violent frat boy and rape him in front of the entire cast? Why is he not called out on it? Why does this serve no purpose to the plot? What happened to the victim? Sure, the victim was a bastard and deserved a good punch in the mouth, but NO ONE DESERVES TO GET RAPED.This scene ruins an otherwise alright film. I know that most of the discussions of the movie somehow leave out this scene altogether (what that says about the desensitization of rape in cinema I don't know) but it was a struggle for me to finish the film afterwards.
