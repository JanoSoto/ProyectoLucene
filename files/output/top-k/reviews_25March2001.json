The contrast between the natural beauty of Papua New Guinea, with waving, sighing grasses, fragile wildlife, and uplifting songs of villagers; and the brutal World War 11 combat in often futile battles illustrates perfectly the film's message - War is the blind pursuit of territory and property, ignoring everything that is pure in nature and spirit, at huge cost of life and sanity to individuals that amount gradually to a cumulative effect on the entire human race. Superbly acted, exquisitely shot, I find the images from this film returning to my mind and imagination over and over again.
