From the eerie horror films of the silent genre, to the black and white chillers of the 1930s and 1940s, horror films have changed a lot! In silent days horror monsters were usually creepy almost regular people (examples The Man Who Could Not Laugh and The Cabinet of Doctor Caligari) then progressed into Nosferatu who probably took on the most creepiest look of Bram Stoker's Dracula. The 1930s then brought us to more traditional horror stories based off of novels as well as almost fantasy horror films like Edgar G. Wallace's King Kong. By the time of the 50s and 60s horror had become more famous on t.v series such as Rod Serling's The Twilight Zone and The Alfred Hitchcock Theatre. By the early 70s horror films took a huge dramatic turn. Probably first starting with The Exorcist. Then The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. These two films came out of nowhere and did not resemble anything else at the time. It was like BAM! And these two films came without their own evolution process. While The Exorcist is still a great horror film Texas Chainsaw takes on its own type of genre. I have seen this film dozens of times and each time I see it I notice something new or hear something new. I also pay more attention to its unique film making style (brought to you by Tobe Hooper.) Texas Chainsaw was only made by a small independent film company with completely unknown actors and actresses. The story was new and fresh and so was the film making for this landmark piece of cinema. I honestly cannot get over how different this film making is from every other horror film I've seen. It heavily takes in the horror genre without any clichés and truly defines how horror films should be. Even though this film is designed not to make you jump or gross you out, it carries intenseness with each passing scene. The guy at the gas station washing the windows is scary alone. The film can be scary and funny, but it carries a certain intensity that know other horror film that I know of takes on. Most regular horror films I watch usually have scenes leading up to climatic events that usually become scary all of the sudden, while Chainsaw on the other hand is scary just watching these kids have a conversation with a deranged hitchhiker who then goes on to cut his hand and catch a photo on fire! This is probably the last best full-length horror film next to Jaws. Now I know by saying that I get all the Jason and Freddie fans mad, so to make clear those films do have the place but are also the off set of another film that follows the same framework. Yep, you guessed it John Carpenter's Halloween set the slasher-jumping genre off and every horror film up to date has been designed like that and targeted towards the teenage audience only. Halloween is a great film and did also create another evolution of films, but by today I think this evolution needs to die. LIke so many other horror films Texas Chainsaw has taken on the burden of carrying its share of four billion sequels that just get worse and worse and worse until blowing this creation up into a remake followed with other sequels that never captured the essence or style of the first but just followed up on the current style of horror films. Part 2 is okay. It seems to me more of a parody and a lot of silly stuff happens with mindless gore and needless violence. I recommend this film to be on your top 10 list of films to see before you die, or before Leatherface gets you!!!

Aliens, directed by James Cameron, picks up right were the original, Alien (1979, directed by Ridley Scott) left off. Ellen Riply (Sigourney Weaver) awakens from the escape pod 57 years later, only to realize that the planet where she first encountered the creature is now inhabited.This movie had all the trappings of failure (its a little over 2 hours long, its a science fiction movie, its a sequel and the original director did not return to helm the picture), yet each time I see this masterpiece, I am gripped with apprehension, terror and sheer pleasure at the action, acting and story that is unfolding before me. Much of the credit goes to Cameron, fresh from his success of Terminator, and before he went on to bring us such groundbreaking films like The Abyss and Terminator 2. His direction and writing (two other writers helped craft the end story) set the right pace for this film that allowed for us to feel the tension of the situation and to get attached to the characters and want each of them to survive (or rather the main ones anyway). And he didn't take the movie into a sole horror movie as the original one was. He made this a sci-fi movie, which meant that Cameron could make this movie similar to the original, yet make it his own, with the end result being this movie. But the director can only take so much of the credit. In comes the actors.Headed by Weaver, the acting is top notch, with a tight supporting cast, including Michael Biehn, Lance Henrikson, Paul Reiser, Bill Paxton, and Jenette Goldstien. Each actor brought with them a niche that fit in well with the film. Paxton's Hudson was nervous wreck while Biehn's Hick's was the cool cat that held the unit together while Weaver's Ripley 'lead' them. You wanted to punch William Hope's Lt. Gorman while if you ever got into a fire fight, you'd want Vasquez (Goldstien) fighting by your side. These were characters you related to and cheered (or jeered) for. With the extended version that was released a few years ago, we were treated with several extended and added scenes that helped build already strong characters and bring irony to the movie (you have to watch to understand this).Acting and directing can take you so far. Without a decent Special Effects crew, this movie would be at the best a B movie, good for laughs instead of chills. Thankfully, Stan Winston and his studio was ready for the task and the Alien creatures (there would be more then one in this movie as compared to the sole Alien in the original, hence the titles) looked superb. From the aliens, to the weapons and ships, the special effects are wonderful never once being campy or plastic looking (note, there are NO computer generated effects, these are all models, miniatures or customs). As a kid, I wanted a Pulse Rifle because it looked and sounded cool, while I wanted never to met an alien because, well, they're not really nice. This is one of those films that, no matter how many times I watch it, I cannot spot fake looking aliens, or bad background art. It seems that the crew shot on location, which is what we the audience want.Finally, the score needs to be mentioned. James Horner wrote a wonderful musical piece that adds to the suspense and drama of the movie. Its hard to explain it in words, but the musical score pulls you into the movie just that little bit more, adding to your experience. Without Horner's touch, it's impossible to truly experience Aliens.If you hadn't guessed, I'm a fan of Aliens, and I recommend the movie whole heartedly.

The only movie that comes close to the horror genre as well was the much acclaimed movie Psycho, which he made prior to this film. But even that movie is more of a thriller really, even though it heavily influenced the horror genre later on. With The Birds Hitchcock perhaps delivers his only truly real horror movie.One of the things you also have to know about an Hitchcock movie is the less you know about it, the better the movie will probably be to you. Hithcock movies often start to head into one direction but then suddenly turn to a complete other. Just imaging going in watching this movie without knowing what will ever happen.

Most of my friends\/peers that are of my age believe their decade of choice is the 1980s. But, my heart belongs in the 1990s.I loved the music better. I came out. I learned about life in and around college. I traveled a lot and expanded my horizons tremendously. This didn't come without a price &#x96; one I would surely pay in the double naughts. (I'm sure those who had fun in the 1960s felt the same in the following disco decade.)That all said, it was thoroughly refreshing to revisit Reality Bites, the quintessential 1990s movie.

The first time I saw this one, which preceded the Abbott and Costello film by eighteen years, was in 2007, and I remember thinking it was mostly an excellent film. When I watched it for the second time the following year, I didn't think it was quite as good, but still certainly not bad. From what I remember, getting into it was a struggle for me that time, but that wasn't quite the case with a third viewing two years after my second one.One snowy night in England, a mysterious man enters an inn with his face completely covered in bandages and asks for a room! Some people there think he is an escaped prisoner, but he is actually a scientist named Dr. Jack Griffin, who has disappeared from his lab! Since his disappearance, his associates, Dr. Cranley and Dr. Kemp, as well as Griffin's fiancée, Flora Cranley, have been wondering where he has gone, and what has happened to him, as they don't know that he has become invisible as a result of his experiments! Griffin continues to try to conduct experiments in his room at the inn, trying to find a way to reverse his invisibility, but when he is interrupted, he becomes violent, and those at the inn learn he is invisible! The police fail to capture him, and he cleverly escapes from the inn with plans for world domination! Not only has Griffin's dangerous experimenting made him invisible, it has also made him insane! Una O'Connor plays Jenny Hall, the innkeeper's wife, and when this character is frightened, she shrieks hysterically! This is one aspect of the film I've never been able to warm up to. It certainly can be irritating, but fortunately, it doesn't last long. There's so much to make this film entertaining, including Claude Rains' performance as the deadly lead character. Something about the actor's voice helps. The cast performances aren't always perfect, but are usually impressive. One would hope for suspense in a film like this, and there's lots of that, building up as the story goes along! At one point, we see the Invisible Man's associates talking about the effects of a chemical which Jack has used in his experiments on himself, and then Dr. Kemp goes home and finds himself imprisoned by the now dangerous scientist! Much more tension follows, as Griffin goes on a murderous rampage and the police try to capture him! The special effects in The Invisible Man are also great, with objects floating in the air and such, and this was obviously an amazing accomplishment! This movie can be very pleasing to the eye, especially in scenes such as the ones with the falling snow.With all this 1933 Universal horror release has going for it, it's still not exactly perfect, but overall, it's still an excellent horror\/sci-fi movie. Even after over 75 years, this adaptation of The Invisible Man can still entertain many viewers today, with its suspense, visuals, some of the performances, and some fairly comical moments such as some of the things the Invisible Man does to people while nobody can see him and what he might say to these people. Even Una O'Connor can sometimes be mildly amusing when she's not screaming. This motion picture is obviously not exactly the same for viewers today as it was back when it was originally released for public screening, but for those who like suspense and old classic movies, I really think it's a good one to check out, even if it's not as widely recognized as some of the other Universal horror movies from the 30's.

It ends the chronicles of the pivotal human characters in the series, mainly Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia and Darth Vader. It brings back other characters who seem either more or less than human, including Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda, Chewbacca, and the darling robots C-3PO and R2-D2. I wonder how fascinating it would've been for Chewy, 3PO and R2 to have arcs the way the humans did. After all, humans seem to be the minority in this galaxy In this sixth and consummate episode in the Star Wars saga, we meet various inimitable characters, including the implacable Jabba the Hutt, who is like a goiter that was possessed with a life of its own and grew and took control as an evil leader of other strange beasts; the adorable, fuzzy Ewoks, the mammalian aborigines of the forest moon of Endor; a terrifying desert monster made of sand and teeth, and obnoxious little rodent creatures that hasten across the corners of the frame. And there is an admiral for the Alliance who's like a sapient dinosaur who began a career as a general and statesman.

I'm sure that in 1972, this was pretty far out stuff, man (I wouldn't know since I was only 2 years old at the time), but I think Fritz's edge has been dulled with the passage of time.You'd think that the combination of outlaw cartoonist Robert Crumb and outlaw animator Ralph Bakshi would be a match made in Film Heaven (or perhaps Hell) but Bakshi's adaptation of Crumb's Fritz the Cat comic book was plagued with behind-the-scenes drama, some of which has apparently ended up on screen. The film has a very loose, on-the-fly feel to it, as if it were being made up as it went along and never properly finished. Much of the dialogue appears ad libbed, and the story really isn't much of a story, as it is a series of vignettes cobbled together. At times it seems confused about whether it wants to be a wild and wacky comedy, or a Bold Statement about the state of America as the 1960s became the '70s.Our hero, Fritz, is a bored college student who decides he's had enough of doing what's expected of him and goes on to explore the wide world around him. He leaves New York City, bound for San Francisco, and along the way he participates in an orgy, inadvertently causes a race riot, and winds up mixed up with a gang of Nazi bikers, among other adventures.

I really liked that.It wasn't worth a 10 because some major character shifts were a little unbelievable (Peck's sudden anger after a really buttoned down, almost wooden performance, especially, but also Darren's character's transformations from killer to brother to killer again were too abrupt and kind of took me out of the movie); also, they never showed the men carrying the supplies up the cliff, which was a little jarring after they had shown the men laboriously retrieving the supplies from the sinking ship.But that's all my complaint.

Peck forces him to get serious (perhaps for the first time in his life) and go all out to prove his genius.

Nonetheless, as they have Peck point out, somebody's got to take responsibility, and there is a job that must be done, and that requires violence or the threat of violence more often than not in the movie.

Basically Johnnie Gray (Keaton, also writing, directing and producing) is a railroad engineer who is love with his engine The General, oh, and his girl Annabelle Lee (Marion Mack). The Civil War has come to America, and Johnnie wants to be the first of many to be recruited and fight, but he is turned away as being needed more on the railroad. Annabelle thinks he didn't even try, and won't speak to him until he is in a uniform, but he is her only hope when she ends up kidnapped by Union spies who also take The General. Johnnie has many mishaps, funny near miss accidents and unintentional avoiding of danger as he chases his engine in another, The Texas, and he escapes death when the Union realise it's only one man chasing. During the night he sneaks into a house, which turns out to be where Annabelle is, and where the Unionists are hiding out, he even overhears their battle plan against the Confederates hiding under the dinner table. Dressed as a Union spy get-up, Johnnie and Annabelle get away in The General and speed away to warn of the plan, closely pursued by the Unionists.

Basically slackers and getting nowhere musicians Pedro De Pacas (Richard 'Cheech' Marin) and Anthony 'Man' Stoner (Tommy Chong) happen to meet on a Californian highway, and instantly find a connection with their love of marijuana. They are pulled over by the cops, and end up deported to Mexico, but in court they are let off lightly by the Vodka drinking judge, and they start a road trip to go back home, and try to score some drugs along the way. This includes a trip to dealer Strawberry (Alien's Tom Skerritt), a little house party snorting some wash powder as cocaine, and the big hoot of the film, unintentionally steal a van made entirely of hardened weed. Along the way Pedro and Man pick up two women, who convince them that they should enter their band in a Battle of the Bands contest, and the final scene sees them win with a very high audience. Also starring Batman Mask of the Phantasm's Stacy Keach as Sgt. Stedenko, Strother Martin as Arnold Stoner, Edie Adams as Mrs. Tempest Stoner, Ray Vitte as Bass Player James and Michael Caldwell as Guitar Player Duane. Cheech and Chong with their man catchphrase creating smiles and stoned foolishness are a great double act, Keach does make a good deranged cop, and there are some good songs in it. I will say, the film started hilariously, it then loses a tiny bit of steam, then it picks up with the fiberweed van, and the last few scenes are quite funny, so overall, it a most watchable cult comedy. Good!

Basically slackers and getting nowhere musicians Pedro De Pacas (Richard 'Cheech' Marin) and Anthony 'Man' Stoner (Tommy Chong) happen to meet on a Californian highway, and instantly find a connection with their love of marijuana. They are pulled over by the cops, and end up deported to Mexico, but in court they are let off lightly by the Vodka drinking judge, and they start a road trip to go back home, and try to score some drugs along the way. This includes a trip to dealer Strawberry (Alien's Tom Skerritt), a little house party snorting some wash powder as cocaine, and the big hoot of the film, unintentionally steal a van made entirely of hardened weed. Along the way Pedro and Man pick up two women, who convince them that they should enter their band in a Battle of the Bands contest, and the final scene sees them win with a very high audience. Also starring Batman Mask of the Phantasm's Stacy Keach as Sgt. Stedenko, Strother Martin as Arnold Stoner, Edie Adams as Mrs. Tempest Stoner, Ray Vitte as Bass Player James and Michael Caldwell as Guitar Player Duane. Cheech and Chong with their man catchphrase creating smiles and stoned foolishness are a great double act, Keach does make a good deranged cop, and there are some good songs in it. I will say, the film started hilariously, it then loses a tiny bit of steam, then it picks up with the fiberweed van, and the last few scenes are quite funny, so overall, it a most watchable cult comedy.

Movies like this and Mash, that also starred Donald Sutherland were very popular with the general public in that it portrayed military life based on the politics of the times. No one could make a movie about the Vietnam war in a negative light back in 1970.Hollywood skirted around this by making movies about the Korean war and World War 2. The only way to understand this attempt is to treat it as satire. Those opposed to the Vietnam war were the target audience for this prime example of manipulation. Donald Sutherland as a hippie tank commander is, in my opinion , one of the most absurd characters to grace the screen in many years. It is a pleasant diversion, but not to be taken seriously. Lots of fine character actors round out this interesting but not accurate war movie. I would recommend this movie for fans of Clint Eastwood, though. Myself included Starring Clint Eastwood, Telly Savalis, Don Rickles ","genre":null},{"date":"23 June 2010","score":"1 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" THIS MOVIE, WHILE HIGHLY ENTERTAINING CAN BE CONFUSING TO ANYONE STUDYING THE HISTORY OF WW2.
