It's almost always good to see Whitaker in a film and his effortless cynism and charisma certainly livens up the enterprise.As for the film it self. It's a sadly predictable affair. With a script although not entirely bad is hardly inspiring. There's also the usual plot holes to be found in this kind of popcorn fodder.

His direction is slick enough and manages to keep the pace going. Where he shines most of all as a director is not in the amazing explosive sequences where the bombs finally detonate. But in the way he makes his camera go to the places we don't normally see. In this case the inner workings of the deadly bombs which is of course a master stroke of ingenuity. I can assume that this owes much and was inspired by the ground breaking work of the Cohen brothers.

This is precisely what this film does, but to call it conventional would be a malapropism. The brilliance of what the Coen brothers have done here is the way they wrote scenes that contain the insight and density of a great novel then presented them on film in the simplest possible way. All the actors gave some of their most memorable performances of their life. Indeed, the characters themselves are not the type to be forgotten easily. You have a quiet psychotic, a selfish weasel, a dishonest and dumb car salesman, a grumpy father-in-law and a smart and honest police woman. What an ensemble! And each character is put in situations where their most basic characteristics are shown. For example, Carl (Buscemi) is seeing a show with an escort and he calls the waiter, who doesn't respond. He then says to her `What is he, deaf?' &#145;Fargo' quite rightly deserved the Oscar nomination for best film editing, as well as all the Oscars is actually won. A lot of scenes are covered from only two simple angles, and establishing shots are very basic set-ups next to the road. This sounds like the way &#145;A Simple Plan' was shot, but in &#145;Fargo' the cuts are exceptionally well timed.

After you have seen Pulp Fiction, things are just different, whether you like it or not. Other films seem empty, boring, un-creative, formulaic, and bland compared to this monster. What happened with Pulp Fiction is more or less a pop culture phenomenon. This film single-handedly set the blueprint for every other film that followed it. Everything from high budget epics to teen romances draw on aspects of this flick. Some incredible things came with Pulp Fiction, and almost 10 years later it is still sending tremors throughout the motion picture industry. Compelling and comedic dialogue, brilliant editing, top notch acting, bravado directing - this film encapsulates everything good, fun and clever about the filmmaking process and audience interaction with a film. Tarantino gets career high performances from John Travolta, Sam Jackson and Uma Thurman. You put these people under any other director and look what happens...not a whole lot. What happened with this movie was nothing short of pure genius on all counts. What you get here is a collection of entertainment, shock and disbelief. All of these things swarm into your mind as you watch this, and surrendering to them is enjoyable. How many movies could you just listen to? Ive had this movie on in another room as I did other things, and it was still pretty entertaining. The dialogue is obviously what sent this movie over the top, and with good reason - it is quite simply incredible. Its hard to summarize my thoughts coherantly on this one...It is THAT good.

This movie had absolutely no technical advisors, no realism, no factuality and was poorly written.  On one scene, I saw one of the main character wearing his police uniform with white sneakers.

A friend recommended it, and I decided to go with it because she's usually trustworthy when it comes to picking good movies.And lo and behold! I was highly amused and very satisfied with my purchase.The story roughly centers around two aging Irishmen (Jackie and Michael) who live in a small, quaint town in Ireland consisting of about 52 people. Being avid lottery players, both soon come to find out that someone in town has won the jackpot. They are then determined to find who the lucky winner is.But when they discover that the winning ticket belongs to Ned Devine (who has died from a heart-attack after discovering he had the winning number), the two men enlist the aid of the townsfolk to claim the prize money.Rarely will you see comedies focused around folks over 60 these days. And even more rarely will you find comedies that are as genuinely pleasant and inoffensive as this one is. (Unless naked old men on motorcycles are offensive to you... hee hee) The casting is fantastic, and the music is superb.You'll definitely be left with soft, warm fuzzy feelings at the end.
