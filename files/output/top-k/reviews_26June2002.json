[{"date":"26 June 2002","score":"","review":"  I loved &#145;A.I.', Spielberg's last foray into science fiction. It wasn't perfect &#150; but for me, science fiction is about the philosophy of scientific progression; the wrongs, the rights, the gains, and the consequences of making the human being closer to our perception of efficiency. In Spielberg's tribute to the late Stanley Kubrick, he explores the morality and responsibilities in &#145;creating' life. Does intelligence dictate life form, and if so, who owns the right to take that away? Would killing an artificially created life form be considered murder? It is not the actual questions that attracted me so, but how these questions are played out in Spielberg's universe &#150; how the movie works with these issues.This is also why I feel Spielberg's follow-up to A.I. is so wonderfully extravagant in its telling. The year is 2054. Murder has been all but eliminated thanks to a new technique called &#145;pre-crime'. This term refers to the ability to see murders before they happen &#150; giving the police (pre-cops) time to find the place, and people involved in the murder, and hopefully prevent it. Even though this system has seen continued success, much of the population still doubted the idea of preventing something before it happens. The scenario is laid out wonderfully by a meeting between John Anderton (Tom Cruise), an accomplished pre-cop, and a representative\/cop from the government, Danny Witwer (Collin Farrel). Witwer's main purpose is to find flaws in the system &#150; somehow prove that although it is possible to predict the future, it is impossible to be certain that it will happen unless it happens. Anderton, who we find early on is one of the best pre-cops in the business, and believes that the system is sound, rolls a ball along a table in which Witwer catches. Anderton asks him why he caught the ball, in which Witwer replies, `Because it was going to fall'. The answer, in every sense of the word, was a prediction &#150; an educated one at that, but still nothing more. From this, we can extrapolate the greater scope of this example Is it possible to predict &#150; for certain &#150; that something will happen? Is it right to condemn someone for a crime that he\/she has not yet committed? From this moment, Anderton and Witwer, because of their opposing beliefs, are immediately split into their own proverbial corners of the ring. Philosophy aside, this is above all an action movie; something Stephen Spielberg is no stranger to. His experience in working behind the camera shows in almost every aspect of motion picture from the shot to the timing. In the climax to an amazing scene were little spider-like robots are sent in to an apartment complex to find Anderton, one of the spiders creeps under the door to a bathroom where Anderton is hiding under water. We watch as the robot looks around the room and turns to leave after not noticing the submerged subject. We cut to a shot of a tiny air bubble that barely escapes Anderton's nose. The bubble bursts just as the last moving leg of the spider is about to leave under the closed door. Suddenly, the spider stops, and turns around for a closer look. The description of the scene is very mundane. However, with Spielberg's ability to masterfully time the action on screen, he is able to create a huge sense of tension. Spielberg's eye is as masterful as his timing. One of the most interesting shots in the movie comes near the later stages, where Anderton and Agatha are embracing. It is a two shot (very commonly used in modern Hollywood cinema), but used in a manner in which I've never seen before. The profile of the two characters looking away while talking to each other is wonderful, and lends itself perfectly to the subject matter of the scene; a stroke of genius during a scene that could have been just another scene.I also have to comment on the special effects of the movie. In many movies, some recent one which come to mind include `Attack of the Clones' and `Spiderman', the special effects, were used in a way such th at it seemed like the filmmakers were building the movie around the special effects. For me, this is a huge distraction &#150; possibly intended to take our eyes off some horrible acting (I'm not naming any names here!). In `Minority Report', the effects are used to help and compliment the movie, never poking its way to the centre of attention, and letting the movie and its characters tell the story. Amongst the huge firecracker explosions and web swinging computer graphics of the modern day action movie, this was a refreshing change for me, and I hope the filmmakers take note and follow suit.Aside from these scenes, Spielberg's ability to play with the audience is consistent throughout the length of the film. It is so easy for him to startle, play with, and manipulate the viewer &#150; and all the time being so very discrete. Much of the film is shot with a filter that makes whites seem oversaturated. This helps contrast dark shadows and retain a great film noir feel. It also lends itself to the idea of how hard it is to hide in a city illuminated by light and surrounded by tiny cameras.The casting is solid, and everyone played their roles convincingly. Samantha Morton was surprisingly convincing, and Collin Farrel was great at making us dislike him right from the start. People who are looking for something to calm their appetite for an action movie will surely be satisfied with &#145;Minority Report'. The fact that this action movie comes with a brain is a welcomed bonus. In a summer that has so far been filled with mediocre blockbuster fare, Spielberg unloads what is sure to be one of his most technically challenging and rewarding works.Larry www.crankyfilms.com ","genre":null},{"date":"26 June 2002","score":"","review":"  I loved &#145;A.I.', Spielberg's last foray into science fiction.

This time round, the alien scum is in the shapely form of the lusciously leather-clad Lara Flynn Boyle, playing lizard-cum-lingerie-model, Serleena. She's searching for the ... and that's all you need to know about the plot!What separates Men in Black II from most sequels (purely money-making exercises, all of 'em!) is that it's at least as good, oftentimes better, than the original film.Smith and Jones make an excellent double-act and here they are in top form. Each actor is also given enough solo scenes and material to establish their own individual comedic strengths. Barry Sonnenfeld's direction is snappy, the computer effects seamless and there are a great many excellent sight gags and smart one-liners in Robert Gordon and Barry Fanaro's script.The film's opening sequence, a cheesy mysteries-of-the-Universe tv show, shows the filmmakers have their tongues planted firmly in their cheeks.

The writer and director state plainly that this is a semi-fictional story using the essential architecture of mathematician John Nash's life, namely his genius, his schizophrenia, his relationship with Alicia, and his winning the Nobel prize. It was NOT intended to be a complete biographical sketch. Plus, since much of Nash's work with the government was top-secret, all that had to be fabricated for the film. As were many of the characters, the delusions, the code-breaking simulations, the speech upon receiving the award. They sought to take a very captivation story of a genius who overcame a debilitating illness, with the help of a special companion, to survive and win a most high honor, and they have done it very well. It deserves Best Picture and Opie (I mean, Ron Howard) deserves Best Director. Second, I want to comment about the acting. Russell Crowe, as difficult as he may be at times in public, is THE consummate actor working today. Just to see what he does with this role of John Nash, to see how he captures the character, how he evolves as the film unfolds, is worth a viewing all on its own. Without getting into the politics of The Academy, nor criticizing anyone else's performance, Russell Crow deserves Best Actor for his role in A Beautiful Mind. As well as he is regarded, I still think his work is under-appreciated by most. I found myself forgetting that I was seeing an actor, that's how good he is, and that seldom happens with me. All the others are good in this film, but Crowe is the sole reason for its greatness.And third, anyone still watching movies like this at home on VHS are missing so much. This DVD, two disks actually, is one of the very best I have seen. Not only are the sound and picture just perfect, disk one allows you to play the film with either the director's or the writer's commentary. Both are among the most interesting of any commentaries, adding real value to understanding some of the finer points of the film. After I saw the whole film, I went back and re-played certain scenes with each commentary turned on, and essentially doubled my enjoyment of the whole movie.Disk one also has some production notes and deleted scenes which are interesting. But disk two has a wealth of extras for those who like to study the whole creative process of movie-making.

It also deserved its Best Supporting Actress nominations for Kate Hudson and Frances McDormand. I totally believed both of them--Hudson as the beautiful, mysterious Penny Lane and McDormand as Elaine Miller, the overprotective but loving mom. But it also should have been recognized for other actors as well. Jason Lee and Billy Crudup were amazing as members of Stillwater, Patrick Fugit was great as William Miller, and Zooey Deschanel was awesome in her almost cameo role as Anita. Also, Cameron Crowe should have been nominated for Best Director. Truthfully, I think Almost Famous deserved at least a nomination for Best Picture. The gist 15-year-old William Miller (Fugit) gets to write for Rolling Stone and travel with Stillwater. Along with them travel sexy groupies known as Band-Aids. Among them is Penny Lane (Hudson), a pretty but secretive teen who uses the name from a famous Beatles song to avoid her real name. As William gets to know this young woman way out of his league, he starts to fall for her. Unfortunately, she won't tell him how old she is, and Russell Hammond (Crudup), Stillwater's guitarist, also wants to be with her. To complicate things further, both the Band-Aids and Stillwater use drugs and do many other obscene things (including deflowering William)--many of them while he's on the phone with his mom (McDormand)--and William can never get a second alone with anyone of Stillwater to interview them.My favorite scenes are the Tiny Dancer scene, the scene where they think the plane is going to crash, the scene where the sister comes home, and when Penny Lane sends Russell to William's house instead of hers. The deflowering scene is also great because you can feel the electrifying chemistry between William and Penny as they stare at each other. I think the scene that really reflects Kate Hudson's role is when she tries to commit suicide and William literally has to hold her up. Patrick Fugit hasn't been in many films, but since this, he's probably wanted for many more. And Kate Hudson was originally cast as Anita, but wanted to read for Penny Lane.

Based on the best-selling novel by L. Ron Hubbard, the film is not only a rousing, action-packed, sci-fi adventure that evokes the best of `Star Wars,' `Independence Day,' and `Braveheart,' but also showcases the work of the much underrated director Roger Christian. This exciting tale of heroes and larger than life villains, against the backdrop of extremely cool special effects and edge of your seat action, is available as a special edition DVD, and is a must-own for anyone building their own video library.`Battlefield Earth' looks like a big-budget summer epic with money to burn and a scale worthy of `Star Wars' and its other Hollywood predecessors, but in fact the film was made with the very modest budget of $22 million (production and effects).  Director Roger Christian, who won an Academy Award for his Art Direction on the original `Star Wars,' came to the project shortly after directing the second unit on `The Phantom Menace,' and actually surprised his former boss George Lucas with his economical use of talent, production design, and special effects.  Christian's rousing and action-packed saga, which is filled with humor, adventure, and fun, takes movie-goers to a world they have never seen before-a world in which man has become an endangered species-via some innovative special effects.  While not as fluid as the computer-generated images of  `Titanic,' it is an impressive achievement that recalls the best work of `Planet of the Apes,'`Blade Runner,' and `2001 A Space Odyssey.'  Tatopolous's production design is incredibly detailed, and makes you believe that this is the war-torn world of 3000 A.D.  When you're not marveling at the eye-popping special effects or set design, you'll probably be marveling at the performance of John Travolta.  Starring as the Psychlo Security Chief Terl, Travolta firmly cements his star status both in terms of screen presence and acting chops. Forget Tony Manero from `Saturday Night Fever.'  Here, Travolta plays one of the screen's great villains, with equal parts of Shakespeare's Iago and George Lucas's Darth Vader.  Terl's underhanded interaction with Ker (Forest Whitaker) serves as a microcosm for the Psychlo's own faux-Machiavellian machinations of death, betrayal, power plays, and secret identities (with lots of faux-Machiavellian dialogue ladled on to keep the proceedings appropriately classical), but it's all briskly shot, edited, and paced with a contemporary sensibility. The artistry behind `Battlefield Earth' is most apparent as well, from the very first scenes through the last reel of the motion picture.  I have already mentioned the film's wonderful production design, but beyond the matte paintings and large-scale sets, there's a true artistry to how the motion picture was composed. Roger Christian creates a wonderful metaphor using the simple contrast of light and darkness in the composition of scenes.  This is especially apparent in the special edition DVD, where the light is perfectly balanced and the image superbly clear. For example, when we first meet Jonnie, the primitive protagonist, his scenes are filmed with the warmth of sunlight glinting off rugged mountains and green pastures. Later, when he allies himself with other primitives, the scenes are again in bright light, showing in a metaphorical sense how important and essential it is to band together against the hostile aliens. Even the gold in Fort Knox glows with a very warm light. Those scenes are contrasted against darker ones that show the Psychlo homeworld and the dome-city that they have made out of old Denver. The scenes are very dark, filmed with cold blue and dark green textures...you can almost feel the claustrophobia, death, and destruction in those sequences. The Psychlos are dark, dastardly aliens who have enslaved humanity and are strip-mining the planet, and what better way to portray this agenda than with the play of shadow and light. Similarly, the wipes, dissolves and transitions between scenes are handled with an artistry that I haven't seen in motion pictures in years; in fact, I can't recall the use of such dissolves unless I go all the way back to the original 1977 `Star Wars,' and the editors on that film won an Academy Award for their work. In `Battlefield Earth,' the transitions between the different scenes move the story forward like pages turning in a novel...and this artistic texture reinforces the story's literary heritage.Every once in a while a motion picture does something so extraordinary, it makes you desperate for more. You sit on the edge of your seat the entire film biting your nails while you are lost in the plot, the special effects, and the action-adventure. `Battlefield Earth' is one of those movies.  When the motion picture first debuted in theatres in May 2000, I laughed and cheered and cried and clapped, and enjoyed every moment and every aspect of the production from beginning to end.  But I was among a select few science fiction fans who got to enjoy the film in theatres.  For reasons totally unrelated to the production, critics trashed this saga of alien conquest and human rebellion during its theatrical run, and chased many fans away with their hateful and denigrating remarks.  They completely ignored or missed the film's true artistry and fun.  Now that the film is available as a special edition DVD fans can finally enjoy that artistry and fun!  They can also see for themselves what a largely misunderstood work of true genius `Battlefield Earth' really is.  I know that when I watched the special edition DVD on my home video system I experienced all of the emotions of laughing, cheering, crying, and clapping again, and enjoyed the film from beginning to end.

Starring as the Psychlo Security Chief Terl, Travolta firmly cements his star status both in terms of screen presence and acting chops. Forget Tony Manero from `Saturday Night Fever.'  Here, Travolta plays one of the screen's great villains, with equal parts of Shakespeare's Iago and George Lucas's Darth Vader.  Terl's underhanded interaction with Ker (Forest Whitaker) serves as a microcosm for the Psychlo's own faux-Machiavellian machinations of death, betrayal, power plays, and secret identities (with lots of faux-Machiavellian dialogue ladled on to keep the proceedings appropriately classical), but it's all briskly shot, edited, and paced with a contemporary sensibility. The artistry behind `Battlefield Earth' is most apparent as well, from the very first scenes through the last reel of the motion picture.  I have already mentioned the film's wonderful production design, but beyond the matte paintings and large-scale sets, there's a true artistry to how the motion picture was composed. Roger Christian creates a wonderful metaphor using the simple contrast of light and darkness in the composition of scenes.  This is especially apparent in the special edition DVD, where the light is perfectly balanced and the image superbly clear. For example, when we first meet Jonnie, the primitive protagonist, his scenes are filmed with the warmth of sunlight glinting off rugged mountains and green pastures. Later, when he allies himself with other primitives, the scenes are again in bright light, showing in a metaphorical sense how important and essential it is to band together against the hostile aliens. Even the gold in Fort Knox glows with a very warm light. Those scenes are contrasted against darker ones that show the Psychlo homeworld and the dome-city that they have made out of old Denver. The scenes are very dark, filmed with cold blue and dark green textures...you can almost feel the claustrophobia, death, and destruction in those sequences. The Psychlos are dark, dastardly aliens who have enslaved humanity and are strip-mining the planet, and what better way to portray this agenda than with the play of shadow and light. Similarly, the wipes, dissolves and transitions between scenes are handled with an artistry that I haven't seen in motion pictures in years; in fact, I can't recall the use of such dissolves unless I go all the way back to the original 1977 `Star Wars,' and the editors on that film won an Academy Award for their work. In `Battlefield Earth,' the transitions between the different scenes move the story forward like pages turning in a novel...and this artistic texture reinforces the story's literary heritage.Every once in a while a motion picture does something so extraordinary, it makes you desperate for more. You sit on the edge of your seat the entire film biting your nails while you are lost in the plot, the special effects, and the action-adventure. `Battlefield Earth' is one of those movies.  When the motion picture first debuted in theatres in May 2000, I laughed and cheered and cried and clapped, and enjoyed every moment and every aspect of the production from beginning to end.  But I was among a select few science fiction fans who got to enjoy the film in theatres.  For reasons totally unrelated to the production, critics trashed this saga of alien conquest and human rebellion during its theatrical run, and chased many fans away with their hateful and denigrating remarks.  They completely ignored or missed the film's true artistry and fun.  Now that the film is available as a special edition DVD fans can finally enjoy that artistry and fun!  They can also see for themselves what a largely misunderstood work of true genius `Battlefield Earth' really is.  I know that when I watched the special edition DVD on my home video system I experienced all of the emotions of laughing, cheering, crying, and clapping again, and enjoyed the film from beginning to end.  Experience the movie for yourself, and you'll see what I mean.

In a culture where few people have ever read a novel, much less a good novel, much less a great novel, this movie is brave enough to be literary.  It challenges the viewer to draw from his or her own emotions and life experiences to meet it half-way.  Most aren't willing to do that.  They take their movies like they take their food, fast and easy.  But for those of us looking for more, this is art.  10\/10 ","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"26 June 2002","score":"6 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":"  This is a brilliant film. It's also, inadvertently, one of the most delightfully politically incorrect films ever made, especially given the period of its release--the era of high pc, the late 80s. It's best seen on the big screen, not on the tube. The opening scene, with the filthiest sink of unwashed dishes ever filmed, has the proper effect only when it's right in your face, as it was meant to be.  Anybody who lived through the decadent phase of sixties\/seventies bohemianism will absolutely howl with recognition of every scuzzy (but at the same time tender and hilarious) detail of this movie, from the drawling, sinister, but thankfully semi-retarded from too much pot, dope dealer, and the obese (if solvent) homosexual uncle--a predatory Oscar Wilde-manque type whom Withnail and the protagonist I spend the movie manipulating and evading, with checkered success.  This movie deals with the period without any sentimentalism or polemical pointmaking one way or the other.  It's cultural anthropology of the highest order!  Go ahead and dump shelves of pedantic sociological tracts which extoll or condemn the sixties and just see this film.  Bruce Robinson is a genius. Robinson's How to Make it in Advertising is a good flick, too, funny and Kafkaesque, but it feels a bit like a film school exercise and, unlike Withnail & I, it preaches a bit.
