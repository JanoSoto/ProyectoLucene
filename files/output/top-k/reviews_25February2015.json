Even though, apparently, the meaning of the film has been discussed endlessly, the story is not all that complicated. Apes are confronted with a perfect object which shoot their development into the human kind. Stanley Kubrick assumes we all know what happened next and moves on, off into space. There, the same perfect object stuns mankind again. Then, finally man (in the form of an astronaut who is on a mission to investigate another case concerning the perfect object) is confronted with the object again, this time in a setting that seems to cut through time and space itself. And then you can still debate a lot of what's been going on, of course... does the object stand for death? Or the limitations of human kind? Or is there a significant circular motion present here? Etc..The first part of the film I found to be rather cheap and silly; actors in monkey suits, a desert with some okapis, two rival ape gangs, and then, suddenly, that object, and... bloody murder, and mankind is born! Apart from what Kubrick is trying to say (honestly, I'm not sure, but Darwin and - or versus - religion múst have something to do with it), it wasn't all that impressive to me.The next parts are much better, since the visual virtuosity is at times stunning and the space stations and such look terrific (ranging from 'two steering wheels put together' to a 'robotized spermatozoon', but still). The part with HAL is my favorite (check the swan song), things become pretty eerie and claustrophobic there. Also, the part where Dave 'finds himself finding himself and so on', in rooms that are a mix of very old and futuristic features, is just perfect.

I wasn't too keen on the performance of Will Wheaton who although of course was a young inexperienced actor back then, still didn't have the knack for being the main actor in the story. Corey Feldman and Jerry O'Connell complete the young boys group and I enjoyed Feldman, annoying character but acted well and he can provide some of the more exciting moments with O'Connell being almost the butt of every single joke.I think Rob Reiner works it well here and he manages to create a piece not only enjoyable but fun, but a kind of fun where it still leaves a bit of emotion to be felt for the people involved. Getting the most out of such a highly acclaimed writers book is not easy I'm guessing and the two writers and Reiner seem to bring this story more or less to life without me feeling maybe the book is better.It's a sweet bit of fun no denying and I feel it's not just a movie for kids or people who grew up in the time its set in, it also brings a true depth and for it's relatively short running time actually creates a rather slow moving but interesting plot.

This movie is very loosely based on true events, but it didn't stop from this beloved musical directed and written by Robert Wise to become a huge hit. The film tells the fictionalized love story of Maria Kutschera (Julie Andrews), a young Austrian postulant turn governess whom job is it, to tend to the seven children of the stern widower, Captain Georg von Trapp (Christopher Plummer). The children are uncooperative and the captain isn't much help, until Maria wins them over, sharing her love of music, but soon Nazi sympathizers, became to undermine her work, by moving into her beloved Austria and preparing to take over. Can the Von Trapp's family escape or will the Nazis destroy everything, she has work for? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling too much of the film. The movie seem like it was trying really hard to mirror, the same success as Julie Andrew's previous film, 1964's Mary Poppins by having a similar plot-line. Both movies have a stern disciplinarian father figure that was turned around by a musician gifted nanny. In my opinion, I don't felt like it was a rip-off, because Mary Poppins goes into a more magical journey; while the Sound of Music is a bit more grounded and realistic. While, I like both films, I think the Sound of Music is way better than Poppins. While, the movie is set in the 1930s, Julie Andrew's character is an example of the ever changing woman of the 1960s. She's more open in challenging the standards gender expectations of a woman and how mother should acted. While she's acts like a mother figure, unharness, liberate mindsets and attitudes of the emotionally neglected children. Unlike Julie Andrew's character in Mary Poppins, Maria is more careless and youthful in her actions. She means well, but she tend to become troublesome, due to her challenging the brooding, dignified lifestyle of the times. She willing to challenge the narrow-thinking parenting approach on how the children, should be raise and be more fun-like when doing it. Julie Andrews's character holds this film together. She's convincing, as both the free spirited wild child and semi-authority figure in this film. It's easy to see why so many moviegoers find her as a good mother figure, lover or friend all rolled into one. Meanwhile, Christopher Plummer is spectacular as Captain von Trapp. He played the character who proves to be the film's hard rock. He keeps it solid and grounded between saccharine romance and compelling drama. While, he dislike making the film, his riveting performance feels so believable that you can see him, turn the hardened captain to loving husband and father. He was never too mean, that you couldn't find him likable. While, the movie makes him, mean. Georg von Trapp in real life was pretty outgoing and was the one whom taught the children music. Both parents depicted in the film, however, greatly exaggerated their standard of living and why both really got married. Despite that, it kinda work. The children were pretty good in their acting and very cute, but there were too many of them to remember. The only one that had a sub-plot story, was Liesl (Charmian Carr). I enjoys the romantic duet Sixteen Going on Seventeen about her. Without spoiling it, her love affect with the post-boy was very shocking and heart breaking. The music in the film are some of the best ever from a musical. The movie is filled with memorable glorious songs like Do-Re-Mi, Climb Every Mountain, Maria, Lonely Goatherd, My Favorite Things, Edelweiss, So Long, Farewell and others. I love the way, each song was reused in different ways in reprises. Other songs like Something Good, needed some more work. Glad, they eliminated, the not so good songs, How Can Love Survive and No Way to Stop It. The way, the movie is shot is beautiful to watch. The opening shot of the movie of the ALPS mountain range is breath-taking. The movie makes great use of the locations in Austria. It's really hard to find faults in this film. Some critics say the movie is a bit off putting cheery and dated, even in its darkness moments, but in my opinion, I think it does a good job bringing heavy realism. A lot of people might hate its pacing. After all, it's nearly 3 hours. Did we really need the 3rd act? Controversy surrounded the film's release in Germany & Austria, where the film's Nazi overtones brought about the unauthorized cutting of the entire third act due to the laws. The American studio forced the third act to be restored to the German release, which kinda anger people. In my opinion, the whole 3rd act with the Nazis wasn't needed. It really didn't play out like that in real life, nor did it had much music. Most of it was there to offset the general joviality of the first 2 acts. I don't mind, that it's there, but I can see why some people think it's seem out of place, even with the foreshadowing in the first two acts. After all, if you take it, away, you still have a pretty good film. Despite that, I really didn't see much to hate about the film. After all, the film went on to win Academy Awards. It even got selected for film preservation in the National Film Registry. It's also nice to see the movie get newly restored DVDs every ten years. Overall It's engaging, inspirational and cute. It's a must watch. The ultimate family movie.

Young and brilliant soldiers in love with the same beautiful nurse but separated by the fate of the war and intern betrayals hard to make more stereotypical. Like many others, I was expected to watch a war movie -as the title may suggest- not a national drama left behind a romanticized plot. If I would have wanted to watch a good and silly romantic movie, I would have chosen Notting Hill. Pearl Harbor doesn't embody the perfect war movie (since it is told to have many historic inaccuracies) but it isn't a good love story neither, because everything happens too fast in this love triangle. Focusing on a love plot is not a problem in itself. It can maybe helps reaching a wider audience (girls don't generally go to see Rambo). But the problem remains in the fact that all the details in the movie sink into sentiment; the numerous sunsets, President Roosevelt's reactions, the social achievement of the black cooker... It seems like Michael Bay wanted us to cry every two seconds of the film. However, one could see above these failures because there are still few admirable things. Even if the war only begins at the middle of the film, it can't be totally denied that this is a war movie because the unique attack is remarkably realized. Despite the horror of the war and all its meanings linked to the notion, the public can't help but appreciating the shoots of all these bursts, fires ands smokes embellished by an awesome soundtrack. Not bloody but still realistic for the public, PH is maybe one of the first movies which represented war as something pleasant to see. To conclude,I don't think that the success of that movie is due to likelihood with reality nor the beauty of the shoots I just praised.

Young and brilliant soldiers in love with the same beautiful nurse but separated by the fate of the war and intern betrayals hard to make more stereotypical. Like many others, I was expected to watch a war movie -as the title may suggest- not a national drama left behind a romanticized plot. If I would have wanted to watch a good and silly romantic movie, I would have chosen Notting Hill. Pearl Harbor doesn't embody the perfect war movie (since it is told to have many historic inaccuracies) but it isn't a good love story neither, because everything happens too fast in this love triangle. Focusing on a love plot is not a problem in itself. It can maybe helps reaching a wider audience (girls don't generally go to see Rambo). But the problem remains in the fact that all the details in the movie sink into sentiment; the numerous sunsets, President Roosevelt's reactions, the social achievement of the black cooker... It seems like Michael Bay wanted us to cry every two seconds of the film. However, one could see above these failures because there are still few admirable things. Even if the war only begins at the middle of the film, it can't be totally denied that this is a war movie because the unique attack is remarkably realized. Despite the horror of the war and all its meanings linked to the notion, the public can't help but appreciating the shoots of all these bursts, fires ands smokes embellished by an awesome soundtrack. Not bloody but still realistic for the public, PH is maybe one of the first movies which represented war as something pleasant to see.

The film also stars Madonna,Geena Davis(from Stuart Little franchise),Bill Pullman(from While You Were Sleeping and teamed up with Tom Hanks a year after this film was made for Sleepless In Seattle),and Rosie O Donnell(also in Sleepless in Seattle as Meg Ryan's BFF).The movie is based on the fictional story of an All American Girls Professional Baseball Tournament and tells the tale of a group of women(one led by Genna Davis who is an excellent baseball player btw) who's husbands are out during World War II and they join a baseball tournament where Tom Hanks's character Jimmy Duggan trains them for baseball. They of course have to battle it out with other professional baseball players to see will they go further in their team and win the tournament, but can they win the tournament in 1943?The film is set in 1943 and its been told in flashbacks since the film is taken place in 1992 and 1943 where we see an old Dottie(now played by Lynn Cartwright,while the younger version of her is played by Genna Davis)who visits her old buddies since her husband passed away and she quit the tournament a long time ago and we see her at the grand opening of a museum about their lives and on the All American Girl's Professional Baseball Tournament near the end of the film which was pretty interesting.Bottom line I enjoyed this movie as it tells you that it doesn't matter what gender you are you can do anything and also you can play baseball at any gender. Also the supporting cast is great and Tom Hanks was great in this movie as I consider him a very good actor as any film he is in he delivers his performances very well in each role he does. The movie also has some very funny moments and some touching moments too.Overall its a 7\/10Also keep an eye out for Garry Marshall who stars in this movie too.

I watched the movie on Netflix one night with my 6 and 12 year old sons, and got a reaction that was pretty typical for them with Disney movies--my 6 year old was scared of the violence and had to leave, and my 12 year old thought it was moderately entertaining. I was intrigued because the movie has gotten a lot of bad press for butchering the myths, but I got to wondering whether this had any effect on how you would judge the movie. Based on a lot of the online reviews I read, the answer seemed to be no, but enough people were offended that it got me thinking. What is the real effect of this infidelity on how we should judge the movie?In the end, I concluded that the lack of faithfulness to the myths is a serious problem, but not for the reasons that everyone is raising. Most of the objectors are doing so out of a love of the myths--they appreciate the original stories, and believe Disney has no right to mess with them. On the other hand, I think the problem is more subtle. The fact is that Disney movies generally follow a formula, are targeted at a specific age, and perform a sort of cultural work that is very consistent. Specifically, they are made for late elementary or middle-schoolers (note that my 6-year-old was afraid) and they basically are designed to instruct the age in certain moral lessons that are necessary for a child's development. The lessons are generally the power of love, friendship, self-sacrifice, hard work, etc.Now, the problem with Disney's Hercules is not that it does not do this effectively; in fact, it has the usual menu of good animation, good songs, morally aligned characters, etc. The problem is that the original myth is actually rather potent in our culture, and a kids' movie based on Hercules is simply disconcerting. The original Hercules is a character that murdered his family (wife and kids!) and performed labors to atone for his sins. His family was dysfunctional and his step-mom hated him and tried to do him in. He came into existence because his dad, the king of the Gods, was philandering. We know these facts too well--that fact makes this movie just too weird to really conceive of.And yet, here it is, with Hercules transformed into Superman or Beaver Cleaver or whatever. If you are the type who can successfully ignore all of this context, you might be able to watch this movie and enjoy the Gospel-Motown soundtrack. Maybe you can enjoy it like you might take in an episode of the Twilight Zone. I think, however, this was not the producers' intention.

The original Hercules is a character that murdered his family (wife and kids!) and performed labors to atone for his sins. His family was dysfunctional and his step-mom hated him and tried to do him in. He came into existence because his dad, the king of the Gods, was philandering. We know these facts too well--that fact makes this movie just too weird to really conceive of.And yet, here it is, with Hercules transformed into Superman or Beaver Cleaver or whatever. If you are the type who can successfully ignore all of this context, you might be able to watch this movie and enjoy the Gospel-Motown soundtrack. Maybe you can enjoy it like you might take in an episode of the Twilight Zone. I think, however, this was not the producers' intention.

No friends, no love. Those are all traps. Krzysztof Kieślowski's 1993 French drama film 'Three Colors Blue' is one of three films from the Three Colors trilogy (all directed by Kieślowski, the other colors being White and Red), depicting the first color in the French flag, standing for liberty. But how does the first installment of this trilogy series play out? Let's take a look. The film tells the story of a beautiful young woman named Julie (Juliette Binoche) who survives a car crash while tragically losing her musician husband and daughter and later on becomes haunted by grief. Filled with remorse and bitterness, she tries to shut out memories of the past and the world itself to melt into her own misery, at one point indulging herself in trying to swallow a capsule of pills, another by scraping her bare knuckles against a stone wall as she walks along, drawing blood. In a close-up shot for one scene in a café, we see her dipping a sugar cube in some coffee, showing us how once something pure can quickly become stained as her life had now become. Certain sounds amplify the story at certain and are key, allowing the film to breathe in a sense as would the incomplete piece her former husband wrote with its beats, tempos and musical nuances or as any other arrangements of composed music as well. Besides the many things being blue that are in this film, the primary focus are what we as the audience will either sense or feel throughout. Whenever Julie encounters a friend from the past, the screen fades to black and we hear a chord from her husband's unfinished symphony. Moments later the screen fades in again and we return to the scene at hand. Here we are to experience the emptiness of this character's psyche for a brief moment and her yearning to be set free from what has ensnared her being. We hear more than we see rather; her inner anguish writhing within followed by the sudden oomph from the full orchestra whenever it fades to black. This happens two or three times more in the film; fading to the darkness for an instant, the chord of a symphony and then fading back in. When something is repeated it is usually for emphasis, and in this particular scenario the director allows sound as well as sight to flourish in volumes. To the sound of a homeless street performer droning her deceased spouse's tune on a recorder to almost being able to smell the hot coffee in a local café, this picture is truly a film for the senses. 'Blue' weaves a mysterious orchestra of senses and emotions together all on its own to capture the essence of grief, loss and the uncertain bonds that must be mended regarding the present state and the future.

The main characters using gossip as a sociological experiment is an interesting idea and is made the most of as we see how quickly and totally things get out of control. The film does lose a lot of goodwill with a lazy twist ending that provides easy answers and will change the way you look at the film on second viewing, I'd suggest for the worst.As mentioned above, the film is about three room mates, Derrick, Cathy and Travis who are all attending college together. Inspired by a communications lecture on Gossip (because of course everyone pays attention during college lectures) she decides to start a rumor and then track how it spreads. They go to a party and see Beau (Joshua Jackson) making out with save it till marriage virgin Naomi (Kate Hudson). So they decide to spread the rumor that the two slept together.The rumor quickly gets out of control, and people start believing that Naomi was raped. Unfortunately for Beau, she became unconscious that night and believes the rumor too, so Beau is up- on rape charges. From there this actually is a pretty good look at date rape and consequences. However this is ruined by the twist ending, which actually throws all of that insight away in order to tell a story of complicated revenge.Look. I give this a tick because it is well made and stylistically directed by Davis Guggenheim. It looks at serious themes, and for much of the duration, does these themes justice. However the ending is either to make or break the film for you. And I would suggest it would break the film for most viewers. However, if you were dissed b y the ending, watch the film again. It actually is a different experience the second time around and it is not terrible as a revenge flick.Anyway, not bad, but could have been infinitely better had it stuck to the issues of date rape and gossip culture.

This is also parallel to Francis Ford Coppola's 1979 masterpiece, Apocalypse Now. I'm going to start out by saying that I found Apocalypse Now to be a much better flick. Platoon is practically the same story with everything inferior, which is why I'm not giving a perfect score. When compared, Platoon is inferior. Even when not compared, this movie gives a great sense of deja-vu. Haven't I seen this before? Both movies are about a Sheen enlisting in the Vietnam War and transcend into madness and insanity while partaking in the horrors of war. Apocalypse Now has Martin Sheen on a mission to assassinate a demigod while Platoon has Charlie Sheen's mental state wearing thin after a massacre occurs. Apocalypse Now has build-ups and gets somewhere with the plot, and has an overall better look. Platoon is certainly not bad. Heck, it IS as good as everybody says. It won Best Picture and Director of 1986, but I think Aliens should have won one of those. I think that any war movie is a great movie. Think about how it takes the action sequences to do and make-up to put on. Platoon's action sequences are excellent. But what makes Platoon the extravagant film that it is, is it's accurate depictions of life in war. While movies like Rambo made war seem fun and cool, Platoon was back to reality. The whole idea of transcending into madness is shown so well by all and is always relevant.

Rather than a damning expose of certain religious organisations, it is a story of a man, a man with good and bad qualities. No particular message in the end, and very disappointing in that respect.Still made for an interesting story, just not anywhere near as brilliant as it could have been.Mesmerizing, powerful performance by Burt Lancaster in the lead role.
