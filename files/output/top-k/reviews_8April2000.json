[{"date":"8 April 2000","score":"","review":"  Words cannot effectively convey how bad this movie is.  I just saw it and I feel I may never be able to see another movie again.  I feel physically ill at the thought of it.  The movie basically is a series of random people getting horribly killed in random ways.  I can imagine the Writers of this movie sitting around saying Okay, lets introduce a cast of characters... and then they'll all die... think we can stretch that into two hours?  It has no redeeming value whatsoever.  I am not exaggerating, this movie must be stopped.  If it isn't it may be the downfall of civilization as we know it.  People who see it will suddenly lose the will to live.  For God's sake please do not see this movie.  I'm not sure I can live with the guilt that I actually paid money to see this.  It will probably haunt me for the rest of my life. If you were planning to see this movie, don't.  If someone you know is going to see it, stop them.  If you hear of anyone that is going to see this movie and you value their life, they must be stopped.Anyway, I guess you get the point.
