I appreciate that Silent Running attempts to convey that message. But that doesn't change the fact that it is an abysmal film on almost every level, poorly acted, poorly written, and downright insulting to the intelligence of any viewer who finished the second grade and who has even the most basic grasp of human motivation and interaction. The problems begin with the premise- the Earth's natural environment has been degraded to the point that plants can no longer grow, so the last remaining samples of forest have been put under domes for preservation. So far, so good. And then these domes are mounted on several spacecraft, and sent out into orbit of Saturn. WHY? It doesn't take any understanding of science AT ALL to realize that if you can grow trees in a dome in space, you can sure as hell grow them in a dome on Earth, and for a lot less money. And money is what the conflict in the film is supposedly about- the spacecraft are given orders to destroy the domes, after only 8 years, and the ostensible reason is that maintaining them is too expensive, and they need the ships to return to commercial service. Moreover, they aren't simply ejecting the domes into space, which would have been sufficient to destroy them- they're detonating them with nuclear explosives that were brought along for that exact purpose (we know this since each dome is equipped with a receptacle to hold the explosive charge). We're expected to believe that a government that invested in spacecraft to preserve the last vestiges of forest planned ahead by putting nuclear weapons on the ships, just in case they ever decided to destroy those forests in the most pointlessly wasteful way possible. Besides the illogical plot, Silent Running isn't even particularly entertaining. For most of it's running time, nothing happens- Freeman Lowell (Bruce Dern), the conservator in charge of the forests aboard the spaceship Valley Forge, is for the most part, alone. He tends his garden or talks to his robots, or sulks and cries. His performance lacks any subtlety, every emotion and expression is exaggerated into a caricature, making it impossible to empathize with Lowell. He's alternately irritating and morally reprehensible, but never identifiable.The soundtrack, while mostly unnoticeable, features a couple of original folk songs by Joan Baez that are the most sickly-sweet, stereotypical, tree-hugging hippy claptrap you will ever hear- and this is from someone who LIKES folk music. These songs clash completely with the tone of the film, and yank you right out of the experience.---PLOT SPOILERS FROM HERE ON---Back to the plot. Everyone on board the Valley Forge, with the exception of Lowell thinks that the entire enterprise is a waste of time, and wants nothing better than to ditch the forests and go home. They show the project and Lowell no respect, crushing his vegetable garden under their high speed cargo transport vehicles, which they race around the ship in like go-carts. Lowell himself is clearly unhinged from the beginning, ranting at his crewmates about the beauty of the trees and the flowers, and the apathy and destructiveness of man with a mad look in his eyes. That any supervisor would be stupid enough to put these people together in a confined space, in charge of an important mission, for an extended period of time is absolutely incredible. When the order to destroy the domes comes in, Lowell's response is predictable- before they can finish, he murders his crewmates, trapping several of them in one of the forest domes and destroying it, going against his motivation. He pretends that the ship has suffered damage and alters it's course, trying to hide from the other ships in the shadow of Saturn. The captain of one of the other ships warns him that the Valley Forge's trajectory will carry it into Saturn's ring, which will probably destroy it, and gives him the time when this will occur. But Lowell doesn't even attempt to change course, risking the safety of the last forest which his ship is carrying. And he neglects to bring the ship's maintenance robots (to whom he is emotionally attached) inside before the ship before it hits the ring, resulting in one of them being destroyed. Despite being a professional conservator, Lowell fails to realize that plants NEEDS LIGHT TO SURVIVE, and that moving the ship into Saturn's shadow starts to kill the forest. When the plants start dying he examines the leaves under a microscope and exclaims I just don't understand it. I've looked at everything, and I just don't understand it. When he realizes his error, he just sets up sun lamps to restore the trees to health- which makes his earlier oversight even more glaring, since there were already lights mounted inside the dome, they simply weren't enough without the sun. Depressed and desperate to prevent the other ships from capturing the last dome, Lowell reprograms one of the robots to maintain the forest, ejects the dome, and then destroys the Valley Forge. But if the forest dome could be maintained indefinitely with a few lights and a robot on board, then there was no reason for humans to be out there in the first place, costing the government money. Even if the humans did a better job, when funding ran out they could have simply left the domes with robot attendants rather than destroying them. The entire plot is pointless. In the end, the last forest is still doomed since no one knows it's there. Eventually the robot will break down, the lights will burn out, the power will fail, or a rock will puncture the dome. Ultimately, Lowell accomplishes nothing. Neither does the film.

It seems that every time I see an American horror film from the 60s, 70s, it has to deal with it. And not only horror movies but also SFX. Let's see what these four titles have in common Jaws (1975); POTA (1968); Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974); NOTLD (1968) First, they have the same basic plot some people put themselves unwittingly in mortal danger when intruding in a foreign, hostile, environment. The are usually young, never old or very young. Also, even if they come on top at the end, the danger hasn't been totally eliminated. Fourth, the usual way of fighting the danger is through fire or by bombing. Let's see in Jaws the hostile milieu is the sea and the enemy is a shark. At the end it is bombed out, but it reappears (Jaws II) and this time it is burned out. In POTA the parallel is even clearer The apes are the Vietcong and future planet Earth is Vietnam. In TCM the youths come to a strange land, where they are chased around by cannibals, one of them wielding a chainsaw. What have in common a loon with a saw and a gang of zombies? They both eat human flesh, they mutilate human bodies, just like hand grenades and land mines do. Then we got NOTLD. Here the heroes are also in a foreign land and they barricade themselves in a house where they don't belong. They are mostly young, while the zombies come in all ages and are locals--zombies don't drive and they may find difficult to hitch rides. So, zombies are the Vietcong here and they kill and mutilate the intruders with their teeth--mortars, mines, etc. (The Exorcist is one exception to the rule but the devil there has been unwittingly invited by the girl and, more important, he isn't going after anybody but her; so the Vietnam ref. is not valid here). There are more analogies. For ex., the ghouls, the shark, the cannibals attack mostly at night, as the Vietcong did, and they fear fire&#x97;as napalm, the Vietcong. There are many more movies of urban Americans intruding in a wild, untamed, land only to be abused, tortured, killed by its inhabitants Easy Rider (1969); Deliverance (1972), and the list goes on. Funny thing, flesh-eating monsters appeared in American movies exactly at the time when the Vietnam war was reaching its most brutal, bloody, stage in 1968.1968 was also a crucial year for this war. The year of the Tet Offensive and of the historic Khe Sanh siege. And at a time of great political violence at home, with high profile political assassinations and student protests. It is impossible that all that couldn't have become imprinted in the works of artists as Romero, and in fact that became their primary focus, even if probably only in a subconscious level, without them even knowing it. But it's all there the butchery, the kids dying...and the guilt of the elders. See that, while the young are usually the victims, the old are the villains, even if already dead. In NOTLD and TCM, the youths have been lured into a trap by some dead parent and later they have their blood sucked by older people--a real guy mummy in TCM--or have their flesh eaten by older zombies. Even in NOTLD the human villain is a middle age man. In Jaws he is the mayor and so it is Dr. Zeuss. That's all in the spirit of the 60s, the generational schism that made the young blame the old for everything going wrong in the world. But at the end the old were certainly guilty of at least one crime against the young they had sent them to fight, and to die, in that war. And that's what all talented filmmakers kept saying in their films, over and over again, during the next decade.NOTLD deals not only with Vietnam&#x97;it's actually a Khe Sanh siege in miniature--but also with other topics of the day, especially race. See for ex. those meat hooks. One form of extreme punishment slave owners used, which was meant to inflict a horrific, painful death on the victim, was his hanging with these hooks inserted into his flesh, to the bone, so he could be suspended from a tree. What GR seems to be saying in those final shots is that the people killing the zombies weren't much better than their quarry; or that blacks have always been victimized by the white, one way or another, if not by cruel treatment, as slaves, then by sending them to fight in a losing war. Strong cinematographic work, considering the epoch at which the movie was made; and its budget (!). One with a very dynamic pace also, which may pleasantly surprise those who think that BW movies are too slow; never a moment of respite. The mood, claustrophobic, somber&#x97;just as must have been that of the besieged GIs, Marines, in Khe Sanh&#x97;is well conveyed by the lighting, or rather the absence of it, especially during the outside shots. The acting of the male crew is okay and my favorite there is Cooper; you'd think the actor is just being himself, so deeply he gets into the part. Concerning two of the female crew, either they have lousy scripts or they simply aren't very good. J. O'Dea overacts all the time, and she goes over the top when telling of the initial zombie grabbing her. As for J. Ridley, all I remember of her is her giggling at something, someone. The zombie girl was great, though, and her mom up to task. BTW, that sheriff would have made a perfect Col. Kilgore, had he ever had to go to Vietnam. I say, 8 on 10.PD I can see, by some later review, that Vietnam still strikes a raw nerve for many.

In NOTLD and TCM, the youths have been lured into a trap by some dead parent and later they have their blood sucked by older people--a real guy mummy in TCM--or have their flesh eaten by older zombies. Even in NOTLD the human villain is a middle age man. In Jaws he is the mayor and so it is Dr. Zeuss. That's all in the spirit of the 60s, the generational schism that made the young blame the old for everything going wrong in the world. But at the end the old were certainly guilty of at least one crime against the young they had sent them to fight, and to die, in that war. And that's what all talented filmmakers kept saying in their films, over and over again, during the next decade.NOTLD deals not only with Vietnam&#x97;it's actually a Khe Sanh siege in miniature--but also with other topics of the day, especially race. See for ex. those meat hooks. One form of extreme punishment slave owners used, which was meant to inflict a horrific, painful death on the victim, was his hanging with these hooks inserted into his flesh, to the bone, so he could be suspended from a tree. What GR seems to be saying in those final shots is that the people killing the zombies weren't much better than their quarry; or that blacks have always been victimized by the white, one way or another, if not by cruel treatment, as slaves, then by sending them to fight in a losing war. Strong cinematographic work, considering the epoch at which the movie was made; and its budget (!).

It seems that every time I see an American horror film from the 60s, 70s, it has to deal with it. And not only horror movies but also SFX. Let's see what these four titles have in common Jaws (1975); POTA (1968); Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974); NOTLD (1968) First, they have the same basic plot some people put themselves unwittingly in mortal danger when intruding in a foreign, hostile, environment. The are usually young, never old or very young. Also, even if they come on top at the end, the danger hasn't been totally eliminated. Fourth, the usual way of fighting the danger is through fire or by bombing. Let's see in Jaws the hostile milieu is the sea and the enemy is a shark. At the end it is bombed out, but it reappears (Jaws II) and this time it is burned out. In POTA the parallel is even clearer The apes are the Vietcong and future planet Earth is Vietnam. In TCM the youths come to a strange land, where they are chased around by cannibals, one of them wielding a chainsaw. What have in common a loon with a saw and a gang of zombies? They both eat human flesh, they mutilate human bodies, just like hand grenades and land mines do. Then we got NOTLD. Here the heroes are also in a foreign land and they barricade themselves in a house where they don't belong. They are mostly young, while the zombies come in all ages and are locals--zombies don't drive and they may find difficult to hitch rides. So, zombies are the Vietcong here and they kill and mutilate the intruders with their teeth--mortars, mines, etc. (The Exorcist is one exception to the rule but the devil there has been unwittingly invited by the girl and, more important, he isn't going after anybody but her; so the Vietnam ref. is not valid here). There are more analogies. For ex., the ghouls, the shark, the cannibals attack mostly at night, as the Vietcong did, and they fear fire&#x97;as napalm, the Vietcong.

While I normally hate it when people compare novels to their screen counterparts, in this case one must wonder what Eastwood was thinking by turning this novel into a film since he deprives it of all of its strong points.

Intriguing concepts are abandoned to give us asinine and often illogical action sequences that fail to generate anything in the way of tension or suspense. Eastwood would seem to be a great fit for the role as written in the novel (especially given a shocking midway twist in the book), but that twist has been removed from the film and Eastwood removes an important lead character from the novel and combines it into his own, which allows him to basically become some kind of elderly superman that can be everywhere at once and accomplish ludicrous feats. A great cast has been assembled, but most of them are wasted and come off badly. Judy Davis is particularly deadly as the Secretary of State. She spends the film snarling, sashaying, and bugging her eyes out as though channeling Carol Burnett's Nora Desmond. The dance sequence between her and Hackman is not only foolish, but seems to have been lifted from a slapstick farce. In fact, the entire second act of this film is slapstick farce without the laughs. Actions are done (such as the attempted assassination of Laura Linney as Eastwood's daughter) that make no sense whatsoever, until one realizes that Eastwood just wants to set up the age old scenario of him being able to go all man-with-no-name on his adversaries - the Secret Service.

It is 22 years since the events in Psycho and Norman Bates (once again played by Anthony Perkins) has been declared sane and returns to society, despite the lobbying of Lila Loomis (Vera Miles again). He takes a job at the local diner, checks in with avuncular therapist Robert Loggia and fires the sleazy manager of the Bates Motel (Dennis Franz), who has turned it into a sex den. He also starts a muted flirtation with a younger enigmatic co-worker Meg Tilly...and then he starts seeing Mother again.The joy of this film is in watching it unfold and in directions one would not necessarily expect. The thoughtful screenplay makes Norman incredibly sympathetic and Perkins turns in one of his best performances. It does not take long to realize that Norman, who appears fighting to maintain his fragile sanity, may well be swimming in an ocean of predators hoping to foil him. There are murders, but we are never certain who exactly is doing it. Is Norman really as sane as he appears? Is Lila's fury of seeing him released enough to make her go over the edge? Is the therapist really as kindly as he seems? And what about the mysterious Tilly who moves into the house and who sports the same name as the nom de guerre used by Janet Leigh in the original? Or is someone completely different responsible.The film is suspenseful and engaging, and wisely avoids overt gore. Perkins does well in getting the audience on Norman's side and rooting for him to not go bonkers again. It is great to see Miles back, but she remains underused and has limited notes to play as the angry Lila. Loggia is quite good playing against type. Tilly is wonderful in the film managing to be gutsy, sympathetic, and puzzling at turns.Unfortunately, the film sells out in the final moments. The perpetrator could be any one of 3-4 characters with suitable explanations, but the film chooses none of the above. The final moments turn into a gore-drenched mess for no apparent reason and then snatches a rather mangy rabbit out of its hat in order to explain the deaths, give us an out-of-the-blue party responsible and needlessly kick the door open for endless sequels (including the odious Psycho 3 directed by Perkins himself). Not since Blow Out have the final moments of a film utterly muted its impact as this one, but one does have to give Franklin and company some praise in that for three-quarters of the way they had a really classy thriller going for them and a worthwhile follow-up to the Hitchcock masterpiece.

Yes it should have had the power armour. Course then it would have looked worse than Robot Jocks(that one was sooo bad) But the book is just awful. Boring, no plot, no character development, bad descriptions and worst of all preachy militaristic fascism philosophy. So its hard to imagine the movie being better than the source but it was.See how bad the book must be if this only rates a 5. At least you had some action here. There was a half hearted attempt at developing the characters. And some of the technical staff did a good enough job for this to pass as better than DTV quality. Hey look a plot, not just marching. So grudgingly I had to bump it from 3 to 5. Almost a 6 because the book was just so bloody boring and they tried to make it work. So good effort, but still falls short.There are already plenty of reviews that detail the movie, so I won't bother. I just want people to know this movie is STILL better than the book so don't be dumb like me and go reading the novel thinking it will be better. It isn't.See Aliens for a good alien vs infantry movie. Or Forever War for a better novel. Hope this helps.

Boring, no plot, no character development, bad descriptions and worst of all preachy militaristic fascism philosophy. So its hard to imagine the movie being better than the source but it was.See how bad the book must be if this only rates a 5. At least you had some action here. There was a half hearted attempt at developing the characters. And some of the technical staff did a good enough job for this to pass as better than DTV quality. Hey look a plot, not just marching. So grudgingly I had to bump it from 3 to 5. Almost a 6 because the book was just so bloody boring and they tried to make it work. So good effort, but still falls short.There are already plenty of reviews that detail the movie, so I won't bother. I just want people to know this movie is STILL better than the book so don't be dumb like me and go reading the novel thinking it will be better. It isn't.See Aliens for a good alien vs infantry movie. Or Forever War for a better novel. Hope this helps.

I know that is not how I should rate this but I am. I saw this twice at the show way back when it came out. I didn't want to but was asked pretty please with sugar on top I never liked it the first time and the second time took any suspense away from the movie entirely.Technically its OK. Acting is below average from everyone, but mostly because of clunky writing. Who ever designed the helmets should have been shot. At least size it to the actors head. In at least 3 scenes, any number of actors can be seen trying to push the helmet back on top of their head instead of in their eyes, or dangling off to the side awkwardly.You know how I mentioned the writing was bad-dialogue wise-its not nearly as terrible as the book.

We then skip to 2032 where a Utopian society has grown up along the West coast of America after an enormous earthquake destroyed much of it in 2010 (mmm soon then&#x85;). This society is lead by Dr. Raymond Cocteau who has created his own vision of what society should be like, and it's pretty lame! An underground group lead by one Edgar Friendly survives outside this society in the sewers under the city. Into this world the psychopath Simon Phoenix escapes cryo-prison with all the skills he needs to survive in this future world already downloaded into his brain while he was frozen. He immediately goes on a killing spree which leaves the Police, lead by Chief George Earle, unable to cope. The last murder was decades ago! At the suggestion of 20th Century fanatic, and cop, Lenina Huxley, they release John Spartan to track Phoenix down. Unfortunately, the Demolition Man lives up to his reputation and there is much more mayhem in the offing for the seemingly hapless police force.I really love the humour in this film, Wesley Snipes over-the-top performance and Stallone's stone-faced delivery are really enjoyable to watch.

This is by far the most negative one I have ever written.)(I also thoroughly appreciated the excellent commentary by John Holder on page 1 of hated it. I have seen 2400 films in my 64 years and this is one of the top 10 worse big budget so-called A level films I have ever seen.)This is the second time Ava Gardner has appeared in a film where her husband or lover has somehow lost his penis or else lost its use. This was the problem in the Hemmingway classic novel The Sun Also Rises that was made into a film in 1958 when Jake Barnes (played by Tyrone Power) either had Mr. Johnson shot off in WWI or else had it so damaged that he could not use it. I did not understand what happened to Ava Gardner's husband (Rossano Brazzi) in The Barefoot Contessa. Was his penis shot off? Did he have PTSD(shell shock in those days)? Did it get damaged and cause him to become impotent? Was he gay? Was he a latent homosexual who found out that Ava could not satisfy him? Talk about a hard luck dame (1950s language). No writer has mentioned that Ava's character was an uneducated peasant woman who did not even have an elementary school education yet she spoke as if she were a college English professor. Talk about stilted language, this takes the cake. The scene where Warren Stevens (Kirk Edwards) and Marcus Goring (the rich playboy) had their verbal confrontation was so silly that I spit up the burrito I was eating. They stood at opposite ends of the lavish mansion and in an excessively theatrical manner started hurling insults at each other. I expected them to challenge each other to a duel. Edmund O'Brien, a fine actor, seemed to have overloaded on caffeine or worse. Rossano Brazzi seemed stupefied as to what motivated his ridiculous character. Humphrey Bogart spent the 1950s attempting to stretch his roles. This was a stretch that Wilt Chamberlain in his prime could not reach. Ava Gardner was being portrayed as an innocent in the woods yet in 1950s style movie subtlety she was sleeping with her cousin, her chauffeur, the deck hand on her husband's yacht and the gypsy to whom she threw her gambling casino winnings. Joseph Mankiewitz won back to back double Academy Awards in 1949 and 1950 for writing and directing A Letter to Three Wives and All About Eve. He was a fine writer for almost 20 years before becoming a director. This was his Waterloo.

Marlon Brando was absolutely perfect for his part. Terry Malloy is a sort of defeated man who finds a reason to fight again, and Brando's portrayal of the character was fantastic. My favorite scene is towards the end when Terry is talking to his brother in the back seat of the car. A lot of Terry's true thoughts and feelings about his life and details about his past are revealed in the scene. You learn about the situation with his brother and how he was forced to throw the fight that would have given him a shot at the title. It is an extremely gripping scene and it adds an extra layer of importance to everything that takes place later at the docks. In my opinion there is a kind of dual message in On the Waterfront. One side of the coin deals with Terry and his personal struggles, which has a great message about self-worth and perseverance. On the other hand you have the film's larger message about tyranny and oppression by those in power, which concerns all of the characters in the movie. The two messages kind of culminate together at the end when terry goes to the docks to confront Johnny. During the scene Terry is finally able overcome his issues while at the same time put down the oppressors, which in my opinion helps to give him a sense of importance and value. He becomes more than just some bum in the eyes of the people around him and he earns their respect. The movie is extremely impacting and I think it's one of the best we've seen in class.

Perhaps one of the most mind-numbing films of the late century, it is one film not worth a good word.Based upon the epic tale of Moses and how he freed 'his people' it appears to be a happy ending, ethical film. However as the film progresses you notice a few odd demeanours. Moses tries to free his own people yet, in the process, kills many innocents along the way. Moses' God brings wrath among the people for not freeing Moses. Raining fire and brimstone, animal plagues and what-not. Perhaps it hadn't occurred to the makers that they were being the slight bit hypocritical. Behind the harsh treatment of the slaves was the other side of the glass, where the innocent people of Ramses were ruthlessly hurt emphasized EVEN MORE by the quivering child and her mother as their people were laid to death. Moses also blames Ramses for this, however it was almost-definitely his fault for bringing it on the people... Since when did the person being provoked get the right to murder? Throughout the film you will hear ear-bleeding snippets of 'music'. The contraptions that they set out for the viewer to hear simply are terrible. They lack rhythm with repetitive lyrics and, as difficult as it sounds(pun intended), it will make you want to bash at the screen with a cobra-on-a-stick.It is clear that in the film they try to keep the good word in for Moses as killing innocent civilians and soldiers in an inverted tsunami is apparently proper etiquette. This is not aided by the fact that Moses and his people has to walk for forty days and forty nights without proper supplies or water. If treks in Ancient Egypt's desert tells us anything it is that you lose a lot of people that way, such as fifty-thousand soldiers lead by Cambyses.Despite all the terrible mind-numbingly tedious motions of this film there is a single good point which I shall sweep across. There is good animation, each shot seems well positioned well enough to see the terror in the face of civilians. Although on a high point, it doesn't bring this film from the trenches although it does lift it upon a fire-step of '5' (out of 10) only to be shot down by everything else.The Prince of Egypt is as difficult to review as to watch, every word brings horrid images of hypocrisy and gargantuan plot holes into perspective. Ultimately this film is altered by preference, and if you are a die-hard fan of the New Testament then by all means watch it.

This a documentary filled with beautiful images, sometimes impressively strange but very real, synchronized with the marvelous music composed by Philip Glass. Koyaanisqatsi is a Hopi Indian term that means life out of balance and what we see in this film is thousands of images of the world as we know it and throughout them we are invited to take a meditation about their meaning. In the first 15 minutes all we see is the real nature, trees, oceans, deserts, everything untouched by the human being, at peace, quiet. When bombs start to explode throwing away lots of dirt of a mine and a haunting truck appears that peaceful world seemed to change. And then technology appears, many good and bad things start to happen leaving our life less hard sometimes but totally out of balance, stressed, unfulfilled, empty, desperate. And all of that is captured by the director who uses slow motion images, fast images that resembles a video clip (Grace Jones and The Strokes used images from this film to include in their works), all presented beautifully and in great symmetry with Philip Glass's music.I'll leave these thoughts and opinions with you but whatever the view you'll have on this film is valid. The best thing you can do is just sit back, watch, enjoy and think about it. Reggio trained to be a monk and spent 14 years in complete silence and praying and when he finally left this condition he was able to make this wonderful film and its sequels, therefore, here's a man who understands that films don't necessary needs dialogs and a plot to show a message, and he's krafty enough to give that to audiences (of course, not if you consider the same audiences that enjoy slapstick comedies or action films, they'll probably hate this movie). And we must consider that besides Kubrick's experience in some chapters of 2001 A Space Odyssey this is a pioneering experience back in the 1980's, telling something beyond narrative, almost wordless (the only voices you'll hear comes from the choir singing in Glass's musics and the word Koyaanisqatsi also presented in the music). It is very hypnotizing and incredible. And despite being made in 1982 (actually more longer considering that the project begun in 1977) it's not a dated film and it's very plausible for any generation.For those who enjoy new filmmaking experiences this is a must see and watch the sequels Powaqqatsi (1988) and Naqoyqatsi (2002) (which I also reviewed). I believe that Reggio and Glass should re-team for a fourth installment due to a common and recurring theme of our days that is well discussed the global warming effects in our society caused by the evolution of societies and the technology. The director could go back to the same places he filmed in Koyaanisqatsi and other places too and show how things got worse and we as audience could make an comparison between society and different times, to have a new perspective on things and to proof (again) that evolution also comes to destroy mankind while we're still getting on our positive way, taking one step ahead and walking back another ten steps. At the end of the film there's the Hopi prophecy and one of the things it is said there is this If we dig precious things from the land, we will invite disaster.

Well more so in the bewildering weirdness, although it felt purposely campy despite some mock serious contributions. Not as incompetent, but hypnotically tacky with its beaming personality. Mora takes one audaciously original idea (a twist on folklore to relate to specific culture and sense of place; marsupial werewolves!) and clumsily patches it together into an Aussie werewolf soap opera filled with shocks and laughs. Like no other could do. He's a man of pure vision who's never heard of the word cohesion. Maybe he doesn't know the definition. Please could you put in to a sentence. The direction of the material simply lacks cohesion. You could say that it might just benefit from that, as everything is so outrageous so why confine it in a sensible manner.

Like no other could do. He's a man of pure vision who's never heard of the word cohesion. Maybe he doesn't know the definition. Please could you put in to a sentence. The direction of the material simply lacks cohesion. You could say that it might just benefit from that, as everything is so outrageous so why confine it in a sensible manner. Mora's surrealist direction is just as random and erratic, like the busy plot and choppy editing. There's no denying how ambitious the concept is, as it's quite different from the norm. Where else can you get werewolf nuns, a Soviet werewolf ballerina, aboriginals that don't look like aboriginals, a determined but love struck Barry Otto (a sincerely good turn), an eye-opening birth scene that sees a baby marsupial werewolf in a pouch (while the father doesn't seemed to be too fazed by making love with a she-wolf and having a werewolf baby&#x85; It's beautiful) and for the locals the never ageing Bill Collins, Frank Thring portraying b-grade horror director and Barry Humphries' Dame Edna getting close and personal to a snarling werewolf (which could be seen as a homage to Dante's original's ending). There are references aplenty from home grown to feature films (like the amusing quip in the cinema --- gotta love the facials of the audience, it's priceless), but being a Sydney resident it was nice to see some familiar scenery on screen. When the action leaves the city (which looks like it's during a heatwave) and heads out bush to the town of Flow is when I found it to fall away. Really the werewolves are not the threat, but the humans that don't understand and fear them turn out to be. Specialists are called in to deal with this threat. These so called military specialists (two of them) are anything but&#x85; and I don't think it's purposely done either. The local hick hunting party seem better equipped and last much longer then those nervous wrecks. The performances of the leads (Imogen Annesely, Lee Biolos, Max Fairchild, Dasha Blahova and Ralph Cotterhill) are fittingly good. The make-up FX of the werewolves was quite uneven, cheap and rubbery although with some colourful shots. It's laid-back air and offbeat charm is simply hard to resist.

The weird thing was is that the subject matters dealt in this movie weren't as understood back then. It dealt with a lot of things - adultery, the lack of faith in people in religion, where does one find their calling in life etc.Whoopi Goldberg is terrific as Delores who witnesses a crime committed by her mobster ringleader boyfriend and is forced to hide as a nun in a convent until they can put him on trial. You get to witness her struggle to try to abide by custom rules but at the same time can't help who she is. While this is noticed by the strict and head nun Reverend Mother (Maggie Smith), the other nuns take a liking to her when she becomes leader of the choir and turns the choir into a phenomenal success by the church and the public.What makes Sister Act appealing are the central nuns who become important to Delores. For example, Sister Mary Roberts who seems timid like a mouse has a terrific talent to sing and it is Delores who brings it out of her. But what is really good to see is that Delores, though at first wanting to get out of the convent which she describes as a nightmare, slowly begins to understand the nuns and the importance of their roles in the Church and how they are all one big family.The songs in the film are memorable as well. I think the third act sort of becomes a bit silly but still nevertheless fun with the whole thing going to Reno. But in the end you see a woman who didn't know what to do with her life and eventually finds it due to this experience.It's just a comedy that doesn't take itself too seriously and really lightens your mood up when you watch it.

This exciting picture deal with an atomic underwater sub and the problems originated for the crew defection to West. Russians make a new atomic submarine that sails silent due to a revolutionary propulsion system . Sub skipper named Marko Ramius (Sean Connery ) defects, aim of taking it to the United States to avoid the Russians from utilizing the sub to wreak atomic war against the U.S.A . Jack Ryan (Alec Baldwin), a CIA high officer is assigned by his superiors (James Earl Jones , Richard Jordan ) to solve the risked complications . Ryan get involved in the tangled chase of the Russian's newest high-tech atomic submarine that runs silent across oceans.First installment of the Agent Jack Ryan with lots of twists and turns , rattling action, suspense and intrigue . The yarn is interesting though based on fictitious deeds. There are suspense, thriller and action, but the scenario is mostly into submarines . Runtime film is overlong , the flick is slow moving but is interesting . Amount of minutes are superfluous ,it has half hour of excess, however the movie is quite agreeable . Extraordinary nail-biting scenes, specially when there happens the final battle on some amazing images. Sean Connery performance as sub admiral is excellent, he hands perfectly the role , Ford has gotten the best character as obstinate captain trying to defect to the West on his ship. Sam Neill acting as the second-in-command is first rate. And of course Alec Balwin is good as agent who must figure out the true motives for approaching the U.S. , this character results to be one of the his best films . This blockbuster is an excellent adaptation of the novel by Tom Clancy , companion to ¨ Clear and present danger¨ with Harrison Ford taking over the role of Ryan from Alec Baldwin and the second part ¨Patriot games¨ again with Ford , who's becoming the king of trilogies ; furthermore , the last entry titled ¨The sum of all fears¨ with Morgan Freeman and Ben Afleck as Jack Ryan . And it belongs to modern sub-genre about atomic submarines as ¨Red Crimson¨ with Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman and ¨K19 , the Widowmaker¨ with Liam Neeson and Harrison Ford. Interesting screenplay plenty of twists and thrills by Larry Ferguson . Spectacular musical score fitting to action and suspense by the maestro Jerry Golsmith. Colorful and atmospheric cinematography by Jan de Bont . This handsome picture is lavishly produced and masterfully directed by John McTiernan . He's an action expert director with hits, such as ¨ Predator, Die Hard , Warrior 13, Basic and Last days of Eden ¨ again with Sean Connery , and some flops , such as ¨Nomads , Thomas Crown and Rollerball¨.
