That's about it. I had heard of this play and movie since as far back as I can remember... as a child my parents and other adults would tell me about the movie, and it sounded like a classic theme and timeless story. At age thirty-three, I finally got around to seeing the movie and I can tell you it is peanut diarrhea.First, the dialogue and staging&#x85; every character's mouth is packed full of stiff, stilted paragraphs that don't resemble human speech in any way. My favorite example Well I'll be a middle-aged mongoloid from Memphis... Since the movie is just a filmed version of the play, we're stuck in one set the entire time, and it's where our characters talk, talk, and talk some more- in spite of the fact that there's not enough story to sustain the weight of the words. Claustrophobia and endless talking are not a good combination.Then we have Nancy Kelley, as Mother to bad seed Rhoda. Miss Kelley is mannered, theatrical, and sings every one of her lines as if she were doing backup vocals on a Ray Charles record. There is an insanity to her- Kelley, not her character- that is more than a little unsettling. Her sing-songy delivery makes much of her dialogue absurd, especially when she has to convey anger, hurt or fear. The acting of Patty McCormack as evil child Rhoda is tolerable when she's angry, but infuriatingly saccharine when she's fooling others by acting pure and innocent. We get it- she's bad but she acts sweet. Next!The bizarre introduction to the film- and even more bizarre epilogue- renders the entire story null and void. We're introduced to the cast- just in case the ignorant audience ever forget this was just make-believe- and Nancy Kelley spanks Patty McCormack, grinning ear-to-ear, evidently a fitting punishment for a multiple murderer!

(Fiddler on the Roof and Cabaret were the last two great examples). Grease was perhaps the nearest equivalent in the second half of the decade. Although it uses popular music rather than the quasi-classical music of Gershwin or Rodgers and Hammerstein, it shares two features in common with earlier Hollywood musicals which set it apart from the dance-based musicals of the late seventies and eighties like Saturday Night Fever, Fame, Flashdance or Dirty Dancing. Firstly, it is based on an earlier stage musical. Secondly, it uses songs in a non-naturalistic way as a means of commenting on the action and of demonstrating the characters' emotions, unlike the dance musicals in which the characters only sing and dance in situations where people would sing and dance in real life.The film is set in 1959 in the fictitious Rydell High School and tells the story of a romance between two of the pupils, Danny Zuko and Sandy Olsson. (Sandy is an Australian, a detail presumably invented to allow Olivia Newton-John to avoid having to attempt an American accent; the equivalent character in the original stage version was American). Also featuring are Danny's gang, the T-Birds, and their female counterparts, the Pink Ladies. As is common in American high school movies supposedly teenage characters are played by actors in their twenties or thirties. Stockard Channing in particular looks more like a member of the PTA than of the student body.Recent films about the 1950s, such as Far from Heaven and Revolutionary Road, have tended to take a negative view of the decade, seeing it as a period of hypocrisy and social repression. In the seventies and eighties, however, film-makers were inclined to take a more positive view, partly because the studios were still under the control of a more conservative generation who had grown up before the social changes of the sixties, and partly because of the trauma of the Vietnam War which led Americans to see the period immediately preceding that war as a lost golden age. Like Diner, a film from a few years later also set in late 1959, Grease looks at the fifties through rose-tinted spectacles.The title derives from the fact that the film celebrates the greaser subculture of the era. Greasers were young men who adopted a distinctive look involving leather jackets and the greased-back hair from which they took their name; they were generally lovers of motorcycles, fast cars and rock music. (In America they appear to have adopted the greaser name as a badge of pride, but in Britain their preferred name was rockers, greaser being an insult hurled at them by followers of rival youth gangs such as mods and skinheads). One of the most popular television programmes in the seventies and early eighties was Happy Days, which featured another greaser character, Fonzie, played by Henry Winkler. Winkler was offered the role of Danny but declined it, apparently because he did not want to become typecast.Winkler's loss was John Travolta's gain, as Grease helped him consolidate the reputation he had won in Saturday Night Fever the previous year as Hollywood's coolest young actor. The success of the film's soundtrack also gave a massive boost to Newton-John's career as a singer, although her acting career never really took off in the same way, possibly because her follow-up to Grease was the forgettable Xanadu. (Forgettable, that is, to all except trivia quiz junkies desperately in need of an answer to the question Name a film beginning with X, and even that need has since been undermined by the X-Men franchise).The film's music, in fact, is really better than its plot, which is no more than a standard boy-girl romance reminiscent of sixties beach movies. Some of its cultural references now seem very dated; I am not sure why the scriptwriters were so keen to satirise the long-forgotten Sandra Dee, admittedly a huge star in 1959 but by 1978 already a prime candidate for Where Are They Now? There are no really great acting performances, but all the stars do what is expected of them. The real star is the music, based on the popular music of the era and unfailingly cheerful and high-spirited. Some of the songs have become classics, such as Greased Lightning You're the One That I Want, the love-ballad Hopelessly Devoted to You and the witty Summer Nights in which Danny and Sandy independently tell their friends about their romance from different viewpoints. (As might be expected, the boys are obsessed with sex, the girls with romance).There are some similarities between Grease and Absolute Beginners, a British musical from eight years later also set in the late fifties. In terms of their visual style the two films are very different, and the soundtrack to Absolute Beginners is based around jazz rather than rock. (It deals not with the rockers but with their mod rivals for whom jazz was the music of choice). The British film also makes some serious points about racism; Grease does not really tackle social issues, apart from a minor subplot about teenage pregnancy. What the two films have in common is that both present an irresistible, upbeat celebration of youth culture; what we see in them is not so much the fifties as they actually were but the fifties as they should have been. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"4 February 2011","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Despite occasional revivals, the early seventies marked the end of the cultural dominance of the traditional Broadway-style musical film.

And he is particularly crazy on this one. Have you seen Jack Nicholson when he gets angry? Boy, he sure is scary when he gets mad! That's what happens with his character Jack Torrance, whose transformation is notorious with strange and even aggressive behaviors and other insanity symptoms. He goes as far as attempting to murder his own wife and child with an axe! More than simply playing the character, he becomes the character. And his face in the famous sequence when he sticks his face through the door he broke with his axe and yells «Here's Johnny!» is crazy! He almost looks like a werewolf in that particular scene, becoming almost unrecognizable. Jack Nicholson is formidable in this role.Shelley Duvall is excellent as Wendy. She deserves all the praise from us. She worked really hard for this role and went through a lot of stress during filming. She successfully manages to stay away from her Olive Oyl image and honestly people should see her as a very capable actress and not just as Olive Oyl.And finally, the kid is cute and amazingly played by Danny Lloyd. His performance is so realistic and believable that it's as if he becomes the character himself. Such a difficult role for a child to play, but he is so good that he makes it seem so easy.The ending is bad. After all of that, it simply shows pictures? That's it??

There seems to be three kinds of people with regards to 2001; people who bash the film for being boring and slow-paced, people who praise it as a masterpiece and the greatest science-fiction ever made and people who are somewhere in between. It's a film about futurology, evolution and the cycle of life. It deals with the progression of man when he faces the unknown and creates new devices to research it. Kubrick had collected an enormous amount of knowledge of past and presence to create the perfect illusion of future.2001 A Space Odyssey is built on traditional conventions and dramaturgical structure. It's divided into three acts, as most films are, and it follows an usual pattern. But in the name of thematics Kubrick had abandoned the conventional plot. But the film is not an eternal riddle that can't be solved. The biggest reason why the film comes across with such criticism is because people see it on lists of 'the best science fictions' and so on. People don't know what they are about to see and after being brainwashed by mindless modern Hollywood; don't understand a thing. There still are much more trickier philosophical science-fictions out there, for instance, Andrei Tarkovsky's masterpieces Solaris and Stalker -- which I warmly recommend. Especially Solaris has been compared with 2001 dozens of times. If western science-fiction, which Kubrick here represents, researches the physical boundaries of man and mankind; eastern sci-fi researches mental limits -- Tarkovsky studies a situation where man should act humanely under inhumane circumstances.The first act starts with a prologue sequence where prehistoric men, apes, live and try to survive -- the dawn of man. There's a huge leap of time taken from the first part to the second; from four million years ago earlier to the year of 2001. But then the leap from act two to act three isn't so far at all - 18 months. This seems to reinforce the idea that Kubrick wasn't interested in time, ironically in a film about progression, but in state, 'mise-en-scene' and space -- and, for Kubrick, film is much more of a visual form of art than a narrative.One statement of the film is that man is still the same which is told to us through the three part structure. In the beginning -- the dawn of man -- an ape found a bone of another animal and learned to use it as a weapon. Then we go through this brilliant shift to the year of 2001 where man has created technical devices with his superior brain that at the same enslave him, and this cycle culminates to the rebirth. This three part structure is experienced again, in the end, when the man travels forward in time. He sees images of him going through the cycle of life; he gets older, dies and is born again. The rebirth, the final image of the fetus, is powerful and spellbinding. It makes the cycle of life perfect. The baby is its own world, its own reality and it is ready to learn, progress and research -- looking down on Earth and us.2001 A Space Odyssey consists of nothing but images of the spaceship, with the exception of the first sequence. The cold, white steel walls, the blue shades and chambers of the spaceship represent inhumanity of man. One particular scene is a good example of this, science and technology turning man into an inhumane creature, where the man gets a birthday video message from his parents. He doesn't care to reply, just asks the computer system HAL to lift up his seat, and when HAL wishes him a happy birthday he instantly replies thank you. Techonology has become man's best friend and all humane relations have disappeared - another clue can be found from the laconic conversations between the spacemen.It's also a film of contrasts; cold steel and the warm ground of the prologue, the humming sounds of the spaceship and the distressing silence of outer space, the blue shades and the blue color which is all around the ship; the only dose of red, love and warmth, seems to be coming from the computer system HAL. In the surrealist sequence also the complementary colors of blue and red meet each other; the mountains and the gorges. In the spaceship the crew eats food through a pipe but, in the end, in the Rococo room the man eats a normal meal -- on a plate. Man has went back to the old times Rococo furniture, paintings and the food. But is still the same.The monolith has occurred a great deal of discussion and will do so in the future as well. It's clearly the motive of the film and collects symbolic meaning to itself as time goes by. First in the dawn of man it is an unknown object which the apes research with great fascination. In 2001 it once again appears just as unknown to the man as it did to their prehistoric grandfathers. They research it and discover that it is a new, and the first, artifact to be found by man from outer space. Towards the end, where the film starts turning into surrealism, the monolith floats in space -- far away from the hands of man. For once more it appears in the Rococo room where the man sees images of his life. It's in front of the man's bed as he tries to reach it, but can't.

The Green Mile is the first bad movie it is going to physically pain me to criticize.This is a story about the death row at a Louisiana prison in 1935. Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) is the hard yet decent man in charge of this last stop for prisoners on their way to the electric chair. Paul is good friends with his boss, Warden Hal Moores (James Cromwell), and is a good leader of his fellow guards. His three closest co-workers are the appropriately named Brutal Howell (David Morse, the young Dean Stanton (Barry Pepper) and the middle-aged Harry Terwilliger (Jeffrey DeMunn). These are 4 decent men trying to do an unpleasant task as well as it can be done.The 5th guard on death row is not so decent. Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison) is a mean, weak and petulant young man who got his job in the prison because he's the nephew of the governor's wife. If Paul or anyone else bothers him, it would just take one call from Percy to cost them their jobs. In the Depression, that's better protection than a platoon of marines.The other important characters in this tale are Jan Edgecomb (the gorgeous Bonnie Hunt), the kind and tender wife of Paul; the vile and deranged death row prisoner Wild Bill Wharton (Sam Rockwell); a meek and comical Green Mile inmate named Eduard Delacroix (Michael Jeter) and his pet mouse Mr. Jingles; the warden's fatally ill wife Melinda (Patricia Clarkson); and most of all, a gigantic black prisoner named John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan).John Coffey was condemned to die after he was found with the raped and bloody bodies of two young girls in his arms. But when Paul and the other guards witness and experience John Coffey's magical ability to heal people from their sicknesses and their suffering, they begin to doubt that God would grant that sort of power to any murderer and to dread the day when John Coffey will have to sit in that electric chair.I'm not going to go any further into the story of The Green Mile because, well, there's really not that much of a story. I will say the acting in this film is almost universally superb and the direction by Frank Darabont is just as excellent. This movie looks good. It sounds good. It even feels good. For all that, though, The Green Mile is NOT a good film.Firstly, at over three hours, it's just too flippin' long. You could easily cut out at least a half hour and probably 45 minutes and lose absolutely nothing. It's never completely boring, but it's so languid and placid and every scene takes forever to get started, to get going and to get done. It's the sort of too long movie that's not tough to get through the first time you see it, but if you try and watch it again you'll wonder how you ever made it through at all.Secondly, as I mentioned before, there's very little story in this film. There are events that happen and things the characters do, but there's no real purpose to any of it because there's no real conflict or moral in this movie. None of these characters have to grapple with any problem and change because of it. Paul Edgecomb is the same hard yet decent man at the end of the movie that he was at the beginning. John Coffey's the same. Percy's the same. Wild Bill is the same. These characters don't live and breathe like genuine human beings, they're just cogs in a narrative machine. They have a function to serve and that's all. Percy, in particular, couldn't have been more two-dimensional if he'd been run over by a steamroller.Thirdly, what story there is&#x85;cheats. At the start of the movie, Percy is supposed to be untouchable because of his connections. But when it's necessary for Percy to be touchable, those connections suddenly don't matter. The audience is supposed to fall in love with Eduard Delacroix, so what he did to get on death row is never even vaguely referenced even though his guilt is never disputed. For the big sad scene where everybody is supposed to cry, one character joins in with his tears even though there wasn't a single moment in the film to explain why he should be choked up. There's an irrationally cruel ending that 100% contradicts something established earlier in the film. And there isn't a single emotional moment in the whole thing that isn't obviously and blatantly manipulative.Fourthly, as technically good a job as writer\/director Frank Darabont did, he appears totally oblivious to the sharply clashing and diametrically opposed tones in his film. He simultaneously tries to achieve a stark, Shawshank Redemption-like realism and a Disney-like family film fantasy. There's both a botched execution where someone slowly burns to death and a prison escape so silly it could have come straight out of The Apple Dumpling Gang or an episode of Three's Company. The Green Mile has R-rated language and a G-rated performing mouse.It bothers me to point out the flaws in this film. That's because so many of the individual pieces of the movie are done so well and it's clearly made with such earnest good intentions. The Green Mile is, in many ways, the best bad movie every made. You'll probably enjoy it a great deal if you have low standards and I truly don't mean that in any condescending way.

Don't try to make links with the sequels because you're not supposed to know what's going to happen in the following movies yet. I think a lot of the sequel fans will watch this movie and say it's horrible because it doesn't fit what they thought Star Wars was all about.

Would you succeed.....or would you EVEN DARE to take up such a task?.Gandhiji succeeded in that and succeeded in a big way.Did Gandhi Fail?......Yes he failed in 1 of his endeavors. He wanted Freedom but not at the expense of Hindu-Muslim Unity. India was divided against his wishes. He failed in persuading Jinnah and Nehru to be together. India was divided and till this day Pakistan and India fight for the silliest possible reasons that man can ever comprehend. Though I might add that Gandhi had planned to visit Pakistan and perhaps who knows he might have reversed partition. But sadly someone killed him. People blame that Hindu right wing killed Gandhi. That at least is the Indian National congress story. Yes, he was killed by Nathuram Godse. But who instigated him is the question.The only thing I know is that it was in the interests of many people not least the British, the West, Nehru and Indian National congress to keep the partition intact. So no one will ever know who killed him.Gandhi wanted village economy, Swadeshi and self economic development. All that is lost today. We are a client state of America. Our economy, our defense is dependent on America. National news and private news channel cover about one Court case in a particular city and that makes National headlines. What about the 70% of India which lives in their villages. Why don't the farmer suicides, the farmer troubles, the issues of farmers make national headlines??? But that is not a fault of Gandhi......That is a fault of we Indians who did not follow Gandhi.Now it is 2011, India and the world needs another Gandhiji.

Would you succeed.....or would you EVEN DARE to take up such a task?.Gandhiji succeeded in that and succeeded in a big way.Did Gandhi Fail?......Yes he failed in 1 of his endeavors. He wanted Freedom but not at the expense of Hindu-Muslim Unity. India was divided against his wishes. He failed in persuading Jinnah and Nehru to be together. India was divided and till this day Pakistan and India fight for the silliest possible reasons that man can ever comprehend. Though I might add that Gandhi had planned to visit Pakistan and perhaps who knows he might have reversed partition. But sadly someone killed him. People blame that Hindu right wing killed Gandhi. That at least is the Indian National congress story. Yes, he was killed by Nathuram Godse. But who instigated him is the question.The only thing I know is that it was in the interests of many people not least the British, the West, Nehru and Indian National congress to keep the partition intact. So no one will ever know who killed him.Gandhi wanted village economy, Swadeshi and self economic development. All that is lost today. We are a client state of America. Our economy, our defense is dependent on America. National news and private news channel cover about one Court case in a particular city and that makes National headlines. What about the 70% of India which lives in their villages. Why don't the farmer suicides, the farmer troubles, the issues of farmers make national headlines??? But that is not a fault of Gandhi......That is a fault of we Indians who did not follow Gandhi.Now it is 2011, India and the world needs another Gandhiji.

Winston Churchill called him a half naked Fakir.Albert Eisntein called him For generations to comes, one would shudder to think that such a man with flesh and blood ever walked on this earth.For me he was the father of my nation. He was a great man who brought down the British Empire . He brought it to its knees and gave our nation freedom not by using Weapons, not by violence, not by killing but by Civil disobedience and nonviolent protest.After his death, rest of African nations got their independence by his inspiration.
