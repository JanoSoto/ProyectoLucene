The plot covers their initial friction with each other followed by a mutual partnership as the two eventually team up to take down & wipe out Hong Kong's most ruthless mobster & his crime syndicate.Directed by John Woo, the film is action-packed from start to finish & features some of the most breathtaking stunts ever captured on camera. The story is equally gripping & never really gets discarded during the moments of action. Cinematography makes heavy use of slow-motions & clever angles during the action sequences yet every detail is firmly captured. Editing keeps the story explosively paced, and the background score makes effective use of jazz tracks to go with the plot.Coming to the performances, the two most impressive work comes from Chow Yun-fat & Tony Leung as the ace detective & undercover agent respectively and both exhibit a charismatic screen presence throughout the film's runtime. Anthony Wong also chips in with a brilliant contribution as the head of the Triad while his henchman Mad Dog, played by Philip Kwok, effortlessly steals every moment he is in.On an overall scale, Hard Boiled is a viciously potent, highly influential, perfectly choreographed, wildly entertaining & immensely satisfying cinema that delivers everything an action junkie can ask for. A top-gear, full-throttled action spectacle & an instant classic in every way, John Woo's Hard Boiled is a must for every film lover out there & is a template for any filmmaker looking to make a quality action entertainer.Although there are moments in the film that completely defy logic, I honestly didn't even care if the rounds in those guns never seem to go empty for the gunfights are so exquisitely filmed & fabulously shot that even after two decades, it remains in a league of its own. If you still haven't seen this genre-defining masterpiece of mayhem & destruction, then get your hands on it as soon as possible. You can thank me later.

Once the effects came on and a first rough cut was shown people ran out of the theatre. Before they knew it a new genre was born, sexploitation.If you watch it nowadays it's rather cheesy sometimes but do realize made in 1975 it came out before the nasty slashers and almost 10 years before the Video Nasty era. People were indeed shocked by watching it. The effects were done by Joe Blasco and he just came out of the effects for The Addams Family series. I must say that some effects (those on faces) didn't stand the time but if you are not into horror and surely not into exploitation then some scene's still can be shocking. It's also Dyanne Thorne as Ilsa that takes this flick to another level. She gives a good performance . It's funny to see almost all girls full frontal but Dyanne never did, she only revealed her juggs. Nowadays she has a private wedding chapel in Las Vegas. Ilsa still stands up against a lot of Italian rip-offs who were mostly based on the sex in stead of the horror. Still, back then for a few years the Nazi exploitation was the next big thing but it ruined itself due the sex taking over the gore or effects. Even Ilsa spawned 2 other flicks and one that was made by Jess Franco and normally is called Greta Haus Ohne Manner (1977) but having Dyanne in it it soon was renamed Ilsa The Wicked Warden.Don't watch it for the acting and surely not for the outbreak which do look funny but for the idea of the makers and for the horror of the story itself.Gore 2\/5 Nudity 4\/5 Effects 2\/5 Story 2,5\/5 Comedy 0\/5 ","genre":null},{"date":"11 September 2014","score":"","review":" Supposed to be a comedy about the torture in the real Nazi camps this turned out to become a rather gory flick for the time it was made.

It has been suggested that both Singin' in the Rain and Sunset Boulevard were based upon the career of Norma Talmadge, a major star of the silent era in the twenties who (like Lina Lamont in Singin' in the Rain) found it difficult to adapt to the coming of sound because of a strong working-class accent. Talmadge was still alive in the early fifties, and I often wonder what she must have made of these two films. Unlike Singin' in the Rain, a Technicolor period piece set in the twenties, Sunset Boulevard has a contemporary setting and was shot in an expressionistic black-and-white reminiscent of film noir. (Director Billy Wilder had earlier made one of the great classic noirs, Double Indemnity). During the early fifties many of the stars of the silent era were still alive and living in the Hollywood and Beverly Hills area, and were still fondly remembered by the older generation, but were no longer the celebrities they had been at the height of their fame and were little-known to younger people. The film deals with one of these, Norma Desmond, a faded silent diva whose career, like Talmadge's, came to an abrupt end with the coming of the talkies. Norma has retained considerable wealth from her days as a star but has become a lonely recluse, living in her vast mansion with no company but her German servant Max. She still receives quantities of fan mail, and harbours dreams of making a triumphant comeback; she is writing a screenplay based upon the story of Salome and John the Baptist and hopes that it will be made into a film by her old friend Cecil B. DeMille with herself as the star. The other main character in the film is Joe Gillis, an aspiring Hollywood screenwriter. When we first meet Joe he is floating face down, quite dead, in Norma's swimming pool. We then discover in an extended flashback how he met Norma by chance, was recruited to assist with her Salome screenplay, became her lover and eventually ended up in that swimming pool. A subplot deals with Joe's relationship with his friend Artie Green and Artie's girlfriend Betty Schaefer, a studio script reader with ambitions to become a script writer. The script for Sunset Boulevard was co-written by Wilder and his producer Charles Brackett, and it is a fine one. There is a streak of sardonic humour running through it, although it is not really a comedy (unless, perhaps, a very black one). The main themes are self-delusion and the traps of fame. Norma, in the teeth of all the evidence, persuades herself that she is still a star, that the talkies are just a passing fad and that the public are longing for the great Norma Desmond to make her comeback in a silent film. She also convinces herself that Joe is in love with her, while it is clear that he is just using her for her money. Although Joe sees the truth about Norma all too clearly, he has fallen prey to a delusion of a different kind, namely that he can touch pitch and not be defiled. He thinks that he can exploit Norma shamelessly, that he can carry on an underhand affair with Betty while remaining friends with Artie, and that in spite of everything he can still retain his spiritual and artistic integrity. He thinks that he can succeed in the Hollywood system without needing to make the necessary compromises with reality. Norma never wakes from her dreams, eventually spiralling downhill into madness, but Joe eventually realises that he cannot have it all, that he cannot have Norma, and Betty, and his writing career. Shortly before his death he resolves to renounce them all and to return to his old job as a journalist in Ohio. His moment of lucidity costs him his life, but it enables him to regain his self-respect. This was an ambitious theme for a movie, but Wilder found two actors equal to the task in Gloria Swanson and William Holden. Swanson herself had been a major silent star whose career had waned with the coming of sound and who saw in Sunset Boulevard her chance of making a return to the screen. (Her last feature film had been nine years earlier). Today this is probably the role for which she is best remembered. As for the much younger Holden, this was the film which made him a major star. There is another good performance from Erich von Stroheim as Max, who at first seems a sinister figure but is later shown to be a devoted servant with a secret of his own. When the film came out, it was popular with the public and acclaimed by the critics, but Louis B Mayer publicly berated Wilder for biting the hand that fed him by satirising the industry that had made him famous. These sentiments were by no means universal in the film world; several figures from the industry, notably DeMille, agreed to appear in cameos as themselves. I do wonder, however, if feelings similar to Meyer's were responsible for the film's relatively poor showing at the Oscars compared to its main rival, All about Eve. That film, of course, is also about an ageing actress, but is set in the world of the theatre, not the cinema. Far safer to satirise Broadway than Hollywood. Today, however, both films have taken their rightful place among the classics of the cinema. 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"11 September 2014","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Hollywood has been making films about itself almost as long as there has been a Hollywood to make films about, but there were three very fine examples in the early fifties, Sunset Boulevard from 1950 and The Bad and the Beautiful and Singin' in the Rain from two years later.

It has been suggested that both Singin' in the Rain and Sunset Boulevard were based upon the career of Norma Talmadge, a major star of the silent era in the twenties who (like Lina Lamont in Singin' in the Rain) found it difficult to adapt to the coming of sound because of a strong working-class accent. Talmadge was still alive in the early fifties, and I often wonder what she must have made of these two films. Unlike Singin' in the Rain, a Technicolor period piece set in the twenties, Sunset Boulevard has a contemporary setting and was shot in an expressionistic black-and-white reminiscent of film noir. (Director Billy Wilder had earlier made one of the great classic noirs, Double Indemnity). During the early fifties many of the stars of the silent era were still alive and living in the Hollywood and Beverly Hills area, and were still fondly remembered by the older generation, but were no longer the celebrities they had been at the height of their fame and were little-known to younger people. The film deals with one of these, Norma Desmond, a faded silent diva whose career, like Talmadge's, came to an abrupt end with the coming of the talkies. Norma has retained considerable wealth from her days as a star but has become a lonely recluse, living in her vast mansion with no company but her German servant Max. She still receives quantities of fan mail, and harbours dreams of making a triumphant comeback; she is writing a screenplay based upon the story of Salome and John the Baptist and hopes that it will be made into a film by her old friend Cecil B. DeMille with herself as the star. The other main character in the film is Joe Gillis, an aspiring Hollywood screenwriter. When we first meet Joe he is floating face down, quite dead, in Norma's swimming pool. We then discover in an extended flashback how he met Norma by chance, was recruited to assist with her Salome screenplay, became her lover and eventually ended up in that swimming pool. A subplot deals with Joe's relationship with his friend Artie Green and Artie's girlfriend Betty Schaefer, a studio script reader with ambitions to become a script writer. The script for Sunset Boulevard was co-written by Wilder and his producer Charles Brackett, and it is a fine one. There is a streak of sardonic humour running through it, although it is not really a comedy (unless, perhaps, a very black one). The main themes are self-delusion and the traps of fame. Norma, in the teeth of all the evidence, persuades herself that she is still a star, that the talkies are just a passing fad and that the public are longing for the great Norma Desmond to make her comeback in a silent film. She also convinces herself that Joe is in love with her, while it is clear that he is just using her for her money. Although Joe sees the truth about Norma all too clearly, he has fallen prey to a delusion of a different kind, namely that he can touch pitch and not be defiled. He thinks that he can exploit Norma shamelessly, that he can carry on an underhand affair with Betty while remaining friends with Artie, and that in spite of everything he can still retain his spiritual and artistic integrity. He thinks that he can succeed in the Hollywood system without needing to make the necessary compromises with reality. Norma never wakes from her dreams, eventually spiralling downhill into madness, but Joe eventually realises that he cannot have it all, that he cannot have Norma, and Betty, and his writing career. Shortly before his death he resolves to renounce them all and to return to his old job as a journalist in Ohio. His moment of lucidity costs him his life, but it enables him to regain his self-respect. This was an ambitious theme for a movie, but Wilder found two actors equal to the task in Gloria Swanson and William Holden. Swanson herself had been a major silent star whose career had waned with the coming of sound and who saw in Sunset Boulevard her chance of making a return to the screen. (Her last feature film had been nine years earlier). Today this is probably the role for which she is best remembered. As for the much younger Holden, this was the film which made him a major star. There is another good performance from Erich von Stroheim as Max, who at first seems a sinister figure but is later shown to be a devoted servant with a secret of his own. When the film came out, it was popular with the public and acclaimed by the critics, but Louis B Mayer publicly berated Wilder for biting the hand that fed him by satirising the industry that had made him famous. These sentiments were by no means universal in the film world; several figures from the industry, notably DeMille, agreed to appear in cameos as themselves. I do wonder, however, if feelings similar to Meyer's were responsible for the film's relatively poor showing at the Oscars compared to its main rival, All about Eve. That film, of course, is also about an ageing actress, but is set in the world of the theatre, not the cinema. Far safer to satirise Broadway than Hollywood. Today, however, both films have taken their rightful place among the classics of the cinema. 9\/10 ","genre":"Drama, Film-Noir"},{"date":"11 September 2014","score":"","review":" Murder is a crime to some, but a privilege to those who are intellectually superior.Rope, is a lesser known Hitchcock movies, but that doesn't make it any worse than his well known ones.

There are, however, moments of absolute brilliance & it's technically very impressive but the story just didn't have enough meat on it to keep me invested in its premise.Set in a Mexican border town, Touch of Evil is a story of murder, kidnapping & police corruption and concerns a Mexican narcotics officer named Vargas who takes part in the investigation of a car bomb that exploded on the US side of the border. The plot covers his conflict with Police Captain Quinlan who's in charge on the US side as Vargas catches him planting evidence to implicate his suspect and tries to expose him as a corrupt officer.Directed by Orson Welles, the film opens with one of the finest long takes in cinema after which the main plot is introduced. And the camera continues to make excellent use of tracking shots & unusual angles throughout its runtime. Editing criss-crosses the sub-plots, music has a very eccentric presence and the performances by its entire cast, especially Welles himself, Charlton Heston, Joseph Calleia & Janet Leigh is top-notch.On an overall scale, despite liking the input of both its cast & crew, the whole picture remained a largely ineffective affair and in my opinion suffers from fractured narrative that felt incomplete to some extent, plethora of uninteresting characters I didn't care for & the slow pace which instead of immersing me into its premise did the exact opposite. The film remains one of Welles' most beloved work in cinema but for me, this was just another classic that didn't live up to its hype.

After all, Citizen Kane is hailed by viewers, critics & filmmakers alike as the greatest motion picture ever made but it didn't leave much of an impression on me apart from its technical inventions, not to mention that I was able to finish it in one go on my 7th attempt.And even though somehow I managed to sit through Orson Welles' Touch of Evil in my 1st attempt only, the end result is still a disappointment as the film feels badly patched together. There are, however, moments of absolute brilliance & it's technically very impressive but the story just didn't have enough meat on it to keep me invested in its premise.Set in a Mexican border town, Touch of Evil is a story of murder, kidnapping & police corruption and concerns a Mexican narcotics officer named Vargas who takes part in the investigation of a car bomb that exploded on the US side of the border. The plot covers his conflict with Police Captain Quinlan who's in charge on the US side as Vargas catches him planting evidence to implicate his suspect and tries to expose him as a corrupt officer.Directed by Orson Welles, the film opens with one of the finest long takes in cinema after which the main plot is introduced.

I saw it only recently and was not impressed by it. The problem with action movies is they do age well if they do not do anything different in terms of characters or story; movies a decade later will inevitable deliver better action. The movie starts quite well. We are given the backgrounds of our three main characters Bruce Wayne\/Batman (Michael Keaton), photo-journalist Vicky Vale (Kim Basinger) and Jack Napier (Jack Nicholson) who would go on to become the notorious Joker. But once Napier turns into the super-villain, all character development is abandoned, becoming a good vs evil film. In the 80's, movies blamed chemicals for anything from mutations and horrible disfigurements to superpowers, just like they blame genetic- engineering these days. This movie is no different; they are the cause of the birth of Joker and he uses them induce his trademark creepy smile on his victims before they die. It is horribly outdated in every way, it is difficult to buy water mixed with primary color paints as deadly chemicals or that they can kill you as shown in the movie.There is earnest attempt at making the action innovative and I can see that it would have greatly impressed the audience at the time it came out, but it is pretty predictably today. There are some psychotic antics by Joker, some chases, some punches, some gunfire and of course Batman wins.Keaton is an interesting choice for the title character and quickly wins our hearts with his boyish charm. Basinger is beautiful and witty and it is easy to see why she has so many admirers. Nicholson does a good job as Joker but you have seen him play the crazy guy character in so many other movies, many of those performance like in The Shining and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest are even better, that it come across as if he is being stereotyped.However, there is one tantalizing scene; the Joker dancing with Vicky Vale on the roof of a cathedral.

Wesley Snipes is fantastic as Blade and I really believe that he was the perfect casting for the mix of charisma and sturdiness for the character. The supporting cast is a bit of a mixed bag I don't understand why Whistler was in this film but I thought he was good in the film. I thought the person who was looking like he was having the most fun was Ron Perlman who was great in his villainous role with his chemistry with Blade being really good. Blade's love interest is poor and a waste of time for the story and the main villain is not memorable at all. The story is poor compared to the first one with the romance being lazy and most of the team are not developed at all and the unnecessary bringing back of Whistler. The script is okay with Snipes and Perlman having the best lines and delivering well but nobody else had any decent lines at all. The style was great with the Gothic take of vampire lifestyle mixing with real life that makes this character so unique. Blade 2 is okay but it isn't as good as the original and I won't be rushing to see it again.

On first viewing the latter was the case with me(after being so amazed by the accessible emotional power that The Elephant Man and The Straight Story gave) but after further viewings(Lynch is one of those directors where each of his films should be seen more than once) now it's the former. While Eraserhead is not quite among Lynch's best films(Blue Velvet, The Elephant Man, Mulholland Drive and The Straight Story) it is still a very good, even great debut from him, albeit with some parts that are a bit too draggy and drawn out. Eraserhead looks splendid, it's beautifully shot and coupled with the film-noir-ish lighting it's a highly atmospheric-looking film. It's not a Lynch film without surreal imagery and Eraserhead is filled with that and in a way that even early in his career is very distinctive of Lynch. The score has an eerie tension and used in an understated way, not one of the best film scores out there but it suits the film well. The dialogue is spare, only about 21 minutes worth and while not exceptional it is a long way from poor, though maybe Eraserhead may have fared even better without it(big emphasis on maybe). Lynch's direction is for a debut very accomplished if not at his best, his direction in the likes of Blue Velvet and Mulholland Drive was pretty much masterly. The story is distinctively surreal and oddball but also very expertly unnerving, Blue Velvet and The Elephant Man feel more accessible but Eraserhead is essentially a mood piece and works amazingly as one. The theme of a man fearing fatherhood will resonate with a lot of viewers too. The mutant baby is incredibly creepy but there is room for some funny moments in a very low-key way especially the dinner-table scene. The acting is great, especially from lead actor Jack Nance, what was most effective about his acting was how personal it felt, in fact the whole film felt very personal. Overall, will divide viewers, it did bewilder me at first, Eraserhead proves to be a very, very good debut as well as a very, very good film where no matter how you feel about the film you cannot deny that a lot of effort had been put into making it. 9\/10 Bethany Cox ","genre":null},{"date":"11 September 2014","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Of a very divisive director, along with Mulholland Drive Eraserhead is one of his most polarising films, with people finding it wonderfully surreal, funny and unsettling and others will find it for their tastes confusing, too out there and weird.

The story is distinctively surreal and oddball but also very expertly unnerving, Blue Velvet and The Elephant Man feel more accessible but Eraserhead is essentially a mood piece and works amazingly as one. The theme of a man fearing fatherhood will resonate with a lot of viewers too. The mutant baby is incredibly creepy but there is room for some funny moments in a very low-key way especially the dinner-table scene. The acting is great, especially from lead actor Jack Nance, what was most effective about his acting was how personal it felt, in fact the whole film felt very personal. Overall, will divide viewers, it did bewilder me at first, Eraserhead proves to be a very, very good debut as well as a very, very good film where no matter how you feel about the film you cannot deny that a lot of effort had been put into making it. 9\/10 Bethany Cox ","genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"11 September 2014","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Of a very divisive director, along with Mulholland Drive Eraserhead is one of his most polarising films, with people finding it wonderfully surreal, funny and unsettling and others will find it for their tastes confusing, too out there and weird. On first viewing the latter was the case with me(after being so amazed by the accessible emotional power that The Elephant Man and The Straight Story gave) but after further viewings(Lynch is one of those directors where each of his films should be seen more than once) now it's the former. While Eraserhead is not quite among Lynch's best films(Blue Velvet, The Elephant Man, Mulholland Drive and The Straight Story) it is still a very good, even great debut from him, albeit with some parts that are a bit too draggy and drawn out. Eraserhead looks splendid, it's beautifully shot and coupled with the film-noir-ish lighting it's a highly atmospheric-looking film. It's not a Lynch film without surreal imagery and Eraserhead is filled with that and in a way that even early in his career is very distinctive of Lynch. The score has an eerie tension and used in an understated way, not one of the best film scores out there but it suits the film well.
