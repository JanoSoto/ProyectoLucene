[{"date":"1 December 2013","score":"4 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Bride of Frankenstein, like Hitchcock's Psycho, is one of the most important horror films ever. Like Psycho, it has also been fully deconstructed over the years. Film scholars have overturned every rock in the film looking for queer subtext. Dr. Pretorius lures Henry Frankenstein out of the sanctity of his pure, Christian wedding bed with the promise of creating unnatural life. The way he gives Colin Clive small shoulder touches and, eventually blackmails him into his plot, make him come off like a bitter ex-lover. Some writers interrupt the scenes of the Monster and the Hermit as having a queer subtext, something I'm not sure I buy.On his audio commentary, Scott MacQueen talks a lot about the religious undertones in the film. While there are some unusual Christian images throughout, most notably the slow fadeout on the crucifix during the cabin scene, I think perhaps Mr. MacQueen is reading too much into it.While watching the film this time, I picked up on some nercophilic tendencies. Dr. Pretorius dismisses the grave robbers from the tomb, to spend some private time with the girl's corpse, an exchange that can be reinterpreted gleefully. Not long after that, the Monster crouches over the open casket of a recently deceased woman, pausing over the face. Of course, the undead Bride herself is presented glamorously, the first time the grotesque and the beautiful were combined in film history, a gorgeous face freshly sewn on to a dead skull. Perhaps I'm reading too much into it but the loving dead seems to be right there in the film's DNA.Textbook readings of the film aside, Bride of Frankenstein is undoubtedly an effective film, a brilliantly constructed piece of work. Franz Waxman's original score is elegant. During the construction of the Bride, the beating heart provides a military drum beat, driving the action. The Bride and Elizabeth share a motif, a dreamy harp melody. When Elsa Lanchester is revealed in full costume at the end, wedding bells ring out. Though not free of the bombastic clanging typical of the era, it's a gracefully constructed score.The set design of the film is far more elaborate. We fully see both the exteriors and the interiors of the castle. When we return to the first film's laboratory tower, we get a loving pan up the stairs, beams looming over head. My favorite set in the film is the desolate graveyard the Monster marches across in search of safe haven. Or even his briefly glimpsed dungeon prison. The chair he's held down in comes across as a macabre king's throne.The movie is well shot. Particularly the moment when the Bride is resurrected with lightening. I love the dutch angles on the doctors' faces, the electric apparatuses buzzing and glowing around them. By 1935, the moving camera was in full use.Boris Karloff gives what might be his best performance. There's such a subtle melancholy to his face, his body language. The early scene of the Monster seeing his reflection in the lake for the first time, enraged by it, characterized the rage that drives him. This is the creature in full rampage mode, crushing all who reject and fear him under foot. But the scenes with the Blind Hermit establish his motives. Like in the first film, he yearns only for nonjudgmental companionship. The grace of Karloff and O.P. Heggie's performances makes the scene touching. It still gets me misty eyed after countless viewings. The search for a friend is what powers the Monster's entire arc. By the time he finds Pretorius in the tomb, gazing down on a skull, his search for love has taken on a deadly determination. No wonder, when faced with rejection at the finale, he decides to destroy nearly the whole cast in a fiery explosion.The rest of the cast is game. Ernest Thesiger as Pretorius casts a long shadow. It's hard to find a better villain in horror history. No doubt, he is the film's primary antagonist, driving all the threats in the movie. He delivers the clever dialogue with an effortless gleam in his eyes, both mischievous and sinister. When joking around with his homunculi, the film's highest moment of camp humor, his idea is obviously jokey. That same tone is deftly subverted into something threatening when whispering to the Monster Now, while closing the door, or telling Karl to go out and murder.Between Thesiger and Karloff, it's easy to loose sight of the rest of the cast. Colin Clive's Henry Frankenstein, once lured into the plan, is surprisingly permissive. He doesn't seem to question just where Dwight Fry's Carl got that fresh heart. He comes off as an amoral character, perhaps unintentionally. Our new Elizabeth, Valerie Hobson, isn't given much to do, sadly. Elsa Lanchester, though her contribution doesn't amount to much screen time, is no doubt influential. Her twitchy body language and goose-like hissing suggests a fully conceived character.The movie is both cruel and clever. The dialogue is frequently amusing, such as Karl and the other grave robber's exchange. (This is no life for a murderer.) Meanwhile, the movie has no problem clipping through its cast. After murdering the daughter in the first film, one of the sequel's first courses of actions is to kill her parents! That two sided sensibility, so obviously Whale-ian, would characterize countless horror\/comedies to come. Every time I watch Bride of Frankenstein, I'm fully reminded of its genius.
