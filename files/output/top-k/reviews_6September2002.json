James Ellroy's novel has lots of color and verve, but O.D.'s on tough-guy bravado and runs off on some loopy tangents (like one that can be best described as Walt Disney meets Charles Manson) the film does well to barely hint at or leave alone entirely.Both book and movie benefit from roundelaying off the same three characters, Bud White, Ed Exley, and Jack Vincennes, and much of the great dialogue in the screenplay is lifted right off the page. Ellroy has a gift for white-hot dialogue, and Curtis Hanson and Brian Helgelund preserve the best of it for the viewer.What the movie has over the book is focus. Every scene in the movie pops on its own while feeding directly into the next. The novel is dragged down by an array of ancillary characters, most distinguishable only by their level of moral decay, who fly in and out with their side stories so fast its hard to keep track, and harder to care. There's such a thing as too much sleaze. A good example is Jack Vincennes. In the book, he is nicknamed Trashcan and is so deeply into porn and narcotics his turnaround seems almost suspect until its too late. In the movie, Kevin Spacey transforms him into a wonderful Dean Martin devil-may-care concoction who scoots through the muck without getting his toes wet, until he makes the mistake of reconnecting with humanity. He sort of does that in the book, too, but in a less convincing way.Here's what else the movie has that the book doesn't Rollo Tomassi, the Victory Motel finale, the good-cop bad-cop showdown with the D.A., the poor wanna-be film actor Matt Reynolds whose scene with Vincennes (When I came to Hollywood, this isn't what I imagined) is one of many that gives the film real heart. It also has some amazing set designs, riveting acting, Kay Starr, and Frank Sinatra.If you liked the movie, read the novel. It's not boring, and Ellroy knows how to write (My Dark Places, a memoir of his tough adolescence, is one of the best books I've ever read.) You will gallop through L.A. Confidential's 500 pages like Bud White chasing down a wife beater. But mostly I think you'll come away impressed as I was over just how good an adaption can be. It's true in general the book is better than the movie, but this is the exception that not only proves the rule, but shows other screenwriters and directors how it can be done.

Like `Survivor,' the name of the game here is, well...survival; but with one significant difference from any of the shows you've seen on television  The winner in `Series 7, The Contenders,' written and directed by Daniel Minahan, will be the only one from among the contestants still standing at the end of the show, meaning `alive.'  Yes, that's right, the object of the game here is to eliminate the opposition, as in `kill' them-- by whatever method available.  Guns, knives, bombs, blunt instruments, anything goes; whatever it takes to do in the other guy (or gal).  And it ain't over till it's over, which means when five are dead, and only one remains.  Of the six in contention this week, the returning champion, with ten kills to her credit, is 30ish Dawn Lagarto (Brooke Smith), who also happens to be eight months pregnant.  She'll be pitted against Connie Trabucco (Marylouise Burke), a nurse; Tony Reilly (Michael Kaycheck) a husband and father of three; Franklin James (Richard Venture), the oldest of the bunch; teen Lindsay Berns (Merritt Wever); and finally, Jeffrey Norman (Glenn Fitzgerald), an ex-boyfriend of Dawn's, who has his own reasons for being in the game.  And so it begins; and the question now is, of the six, which will become the hunters, and which the hunted?  Does Dawn stand a chance of putting five more notches on her scorecard?  Or this week, will one of the other five prevail, and walk away with the cash?  Or, more notably, be the `one' who is able to do so.It was inevitable that this film-- or one like it-- would be made, given the way television has been saturated with `reality,' the past few years.  And since it had to happen, at least it was born of, evolved and guided by the artistic capabilities of Minahan, who has crafted and delivered a gripping, thought provoking satire that reaches it's apex of effectiveness hours, or even days, after the film has ended; because for anyone with any scruples at all, this film will linger in the memory like a phosphene caused by rubbing the eye, and it'll take that long to even begin to sort out the myriad implications of it all.  The obvious question\/message of the film is, of course, just how far should\/could\/can society go in this direction before realizing the consequences of the moral turpitude `reality' shows must necessarily embrace to be successful.  Minahan does not moralize overtly, however; rather, he very subtly plants the suggestion of what the next step in real life may be within the matter-of-fact presentation and context of his story.  And he does it with such precision that it is not until much later that the full impact of it hits you, and it's then that you understand how extremely appalling and depraved the concept is when extrapolated to the nth degree, as Minahan so aptly illustrates here.  Minahan's approach may be more clever than imaginative, as his film plays out as if it were lifted from the negative of `Survivor' or one of it's clones.  But it's cleverness at it's best.  A film cannot seem this true-to-life and entirely natural without a lot of hard work that includes technical knowledge, an eye for detail and an impressive grasp of human nature; Minahan didn't just walk onto the set one day and crank out such an accurate duplication of a `reality' show.  It begins with the astute insights Minahan weaves so incisively throughout his screenplay, and culminates in the way he translated it all to the screen.  Watching this film is something akin to watching Jim Carrey early in his career doing Henry Fonda, or Kevin Spacey doing Christopher Walken or Pacino; it's the kind of professional impersonation\/interpretation that just doesn't get any better.What makes it so enthralling is that Minahan so succinctly captures that documentary look and feel of what has become a `genre' of television, and like the best of them, he lets you get to know the contestants-- through interviews and `mini-bios'-- before the bloodbath begins, so that you can pick your favorites and put your money on the one you think has what it takes to win.  He creates a genuine `sporting event' atmosphere, which works at the time-- it puts you in the moment and draws you into the action-- but in retrospect, it makes all that has transpired and everything you've witnessed seem even more disconcerting (which is, of course, the idea).  And you realize, finally, that you've been duped into accepting the unacceptable, and moreover, made to believe by some perverse rationalization of thought that it was all right; which in itself is a keen observation of the power of the medium through which it is proffered.To make the `reality' convincing, the performances, of course, had to be convincing; and they are.  Minahan extracts precisely what was needed from his actors to really sell the show, beginning with Brooke Smith's portrayal of Dawn.  This is the central character of the film, so it was imperative that she be especially believable, and Smith pulls it off beautifully.  As you watch her, you never get the feeling that you're watching an actor; in keeping with the documentary feel of the film, this is Dawn, a young, pregnant woman involved in a game of killing for cash.  it's a solid performance, the kind of which is often overlooked or taken for granted precisely because it is so natural.  The supporting cast includes Donna Hanover (Sheila), Angelina Phillips (Doria), Nada Despotovich (Michelle) and Alex Yershov (Nathan).  To call this film pure entertainment would be wrong; to call `Series 7, The Contenders' an entertaining indictment against moral sense and sensibility, however, would be accurate.

Like `Survivor,' the name of the game here is, well...survival; but with one significant difference from any of the shows you've seen on television  The winner in `Series 7, The Contenders,' written and directed by Daniel Minahan, will be the only one from among the contestants still standing at the end of the show, meaning `alive.'  Yes, that's right, the object of the game here is to eliminate the opposition, as in `kill' them-- by whatever method available.  Guns, knives, bombs, blunt instruments, anything goes; whatever it takes to do in the other guy (or gal).  And it ain't over till it's over, which means when five are dead, and only one remains.  Of the six in contention this week, the returning champion, with ten kills to her credit, is 30ish Dawn Lagarto (Brooke Smith), who also happens to be eight months pregnant.  She'll be pitted against Connie Trabucco (Marylouise Burke), a nurse; Tony Reilly (Michael Kaycheck) a husband and father of three; Franklin James (Richard Venture), the oldest of the bunch; teen Lindsay Berns (Merritt Wever); and finally, Jeffrey Norman (Glenn Fitzgerald), an ex-boyfriend of Dawn's, who has his own reasons for being in the game.  And so it begins; and the question now is, of the six, which will become the hunters, and which the hunted?  Does Dawn stand a chance of putting five more notches on her scorecard?  Or this week, will one of the other five prevail, and walk away with the cash?  Or, more notably, be the `one' who is able to do so.It was inevitable that this film-- or one like it-- would be made, given the way television has been saturated with `reality,' the past few years.  And since it had to happen, at least it was born of, evolved and guided by the artistic capabilities of Minahan, who has crafted and delivered a gripping, thought provoking satire that reaches it's apex of effectiveness hours, or even days, after the film has ended; because for anyone with any scruples at all, this film will linger in the memory like a phosphene caused by rubbing the eye, and it'll take that long to even begin to sort out the myriad implications of it all.  The obvious question\/message of the film is, of course, just how far should\/could\/can society go in this direction before realizing the consequences of the moral turpitude `reality' shows must necessarily embrace to be successful.  Minahan does not moralize overtly, however; rather, he very subtly plants the suggestion of what the next step in real life may be within the matter-of-fact presentation and context of his story.  And he does it with such precision that it is not until much later that the full impact of it hits you, and it's then that you understand how extremely appalling and depraved the concept is when extrapolated to the nth degree, as Minahan so aptly illustrates here.  Minahan's approach may be more clever than imaginative, as his film plays out as if it were lifted from the negative of `Survivor' or one of it's clones.  But it's cleverness at it's best.  A film cannot seem this true-to-life and entirely natural without a lot of hard work that includes technical knowledge, an eye for detail and an impressive grasp of human nature; Minahan didn't just walk onto the set one day and crank out such an accurate duplication of a `reality' show.  It begins with the astute insights Minahan weaves so incisively throughout his screenplay, and culminates in the way he translated it all to the screen.  Watching this film is something akin to watching Jim Carrey early in his career doing Henry Fonda, or Kevin Spacey doing Christopher Walken or Pacino; it's the kind of professional impersonation\/interpretation that just doesn't get any better.What makes it so enthralling is that Minahan so succinctly captures that documentary look and feel of what has become a `genre' of television, and like the best of them, he lets you get to know the contestants-- through interviews and `mini-bios'-- before the bloodbath begins, so that you can pick your favorites and put your money on the one you think has what it takes to win.  He creates a genuine `sporting event' atmosphere, which works at the time-- it puts you in the moment and draws you into the action-- but in retrospect, it makes all that has transpired and everything you've witnessed seem even more disconcerting (which is, of course, the idea).  And you realize, finally, that you've been duped into accepting the unacceptable, and moreover, made to believe by some perverse rationalization of thought that it was all right; which in itself is a keen observation of the power of the medium through which it is proffered.To make the `reality' convincing, the performances, of course, had to be convincing; and they are.  Minahan extracts precisely what was needed from his actors to really sell the show, beginning with Brooke Smith's portrayal of Dawn.  This is the central character of the film, so it was imperative that she be especially believable, and Smith pulls it off beautifully.  As you watch her, you never get the feeling that you're watching an actor; in keeping with the documentary feel of the film, this is Dawn, a young, pregnant woman involved in a game of killing for cash.  it's a solid performance, the kind of which is often overlooked or taken for granted precisely because it is so natural.  The supporting cast includes Donna Hanover (Sheila), Angelina Phillips (Doria), Nada Despotovich (Michelle) and Alex Yershov (Nathan).

There is also a terrific cast - Marlon Brando plays Christian Diestl, an idealistic Austrian ski instructor who joins the German army to serve the Fuher;  Montgomery Clift plays Noah Ackerman, a Jewish kid from Brooklyn, who carries out his patriotic duty and answers the nation's calling to fight against tyranny and yet has to fight against tyranny of a different kind in his own barracks;  Dean Martin plays Michael Whiteacre(and Oh what a wonderful role that could have been) , a playboy who finds himself somehow having a great desire to go to the front lines.  The film also saw fit to cast Maximilian Schell with a supporting role in playing Captain Hardenberg, who is unhappy with his police duty in Paris and ends up sacrificing his men in North Africa.  And there you also have Hope Lange who plays Hope Plowman who falls in love with Ackerman knowing her father dislikes anybody Jewish; and Dora Doll who plays the French girl Simone who hates Christian Diestl as the conqueror but loves him when he is helpless. All the right kind of ingredients are there for this to turn into an epic film, and yet it fell short of excellence.  Good yes, but excellent, I am afraid NO.The film did succeed in capturing the essence of the book in many scenes. Brando's portrayal of Diestl was brilliant right up to the end.  His ideals, his heroism in France, his dissatisfaction of his duty, his affair with his Captain's wife, his disillusionment, his pitiful retreat, and his sense of humanity that is heavily clouded by his blind ideals were all vividly brought to the screen by Brando's skillful rendering.  Scenes where Ackerman was mistreated and was forced to fight the three biggest guys in the barracks, where he met Hope's father, brought out the serious question of what people were in the war for, as did the book.  And you merely have to look at Maximilian Schell to know that he was Captain Hardenberg.Yet the film's biggest flop was its departure from the book.  It sought to soften the much harsher reality presented by Erwin Shaw's writing, perhaps for fear that the audience would not like it.  It gave the US military a much sweeter image in its upper brass than the book did.  It over simplified Whiteacre's character and the audience were not given the in-depth examination, as is evident in the book, of this relatively well-to-do playwright's life, his desires and what eventually brought him into the war. The film, perhaps trying to cut its length, reduced Whiteacre into a savvy singer type, which was a terrible under-appreciation of Dean Martin's potential.  (Incidentally, if you catch Dean Martin in Airport1970, you'll find that he is capable of much more complex personalities.)  The biggest disappointment, and its most unforgiving departure from the original novel, comes at the end when Christian Diestl smashes his machine pistol and gets shot by Whiteacre all too easily and Noah Ackerman returns home alive to reunite with Hope.  Smashing the gun, although well done choreographically by Brando, only amounts to a poor attempt at a direct showing of anti-war sentiment.  The book does it much more artfully with a detailed story that has Diestl fight to the last bullet killing Ackerman, and then has Whiteacre staring down and pulling the trigger at a wounded and smiling Christian Diestl.  The film's having Ackerman stay alive in the end was just a bit too typical a happy-ending that was all too prevalent in those days of the 50's.  Personally, I like the ending better if the hero dies, but that may just be me.Overall, I would say this film did not use the right kind of ingredients to the fullest of their potential.

There is a plot filled with rising action, climax, and resolution, but the plot serves as the medium for some of the funniest moments imaginable.  Dave Chappelle and Jim Bruer possess such natural gifts for comedy and take an already amusing script and make it so much better. Stephen Wright was so incredibly funny as the man on the couch, and Harland Williams (the hitchhiker from `Something About Mary')  did a fabulous comedic job, particularly in the scene where he just writes on the black guy's picture.  This movie is definitely one that will be watched many, many times - quoted many, many more times.  -8\/10- ","genre":"Comedy, Crime"},{"date":"6 September 2002","score":"","review":"  Stanley Kubrick is my favorite director, and watching The Shining recently on DVD reminded me why. Kubrick has an uncanny way of setting up normal-looking objects and places so that they have an alien, spacey, distant quality. There are so many other adjectives one could use. He uses lighting, especially in The Shining, masterfully. The Shining, visually, is all about glows and indirect lighting, putting us in the mood for a ghostly story. Strange repeated geometric patterns, which Kubrick shoots with obsessive care, provide more mood, illustrating the relentless heartlessness of the icy world outside of the small bits of quivering, vulnerable warmth known as human beings. (The interlocking geometric carpeting which young Danny plays on, and the fabled hedge maze outside The Overlook Hotel are two prime examples of this.) Finally, even the camera work in The Shining contributes to its otherworldly, inhuman feel, as the camera flows down the hallways and around the corners of The Overlook like a ghost sweeping through a graveyard, or, even more relevantly, like the tidal wave of blood sluicing from the elevators in Danny's visions. The inhumanity in the way the camera moves - which is contrasted with the clumsiness of the human subjects the camera inevitably follows -  causes the sneaking feeling that there is something out there which cannot be stopped.Like the best horror films, The Shining works its fear by building dramatic tension. Jack Nicholson's performance explores all the rage, delusion, and confusion needed to lead us down the path from normal world to the other-world of The Shining's darkest moments. When he does go over the top, he plays right into the movie's hands. Even Scatman Crothers' jovial performance, seemingly at odds with the movie's tone, allows something Satanic beneath the surface. Shelly Duvall's Southern neurotic is somewhat unexplained, but she does her best, and visually she could not be more perfect as the dark-haired willow in the haunted hotel. Danny Lloyd as Danny-Boy holds his own in the surprisingly large number of scenes he is required to carry. His creepy 10-year-old voice screaming Redrum! as Shelly Duvall sleeps may give you chills.

I'd say fans of Porky's, Animal House and American Pie (a veteran of which plays Chester here) looking for the same kind of testosterone-happy, slobbish teen humour. And the film doesn't quite pull it off. That doesn't mean to say it's a bad piece. The sheer ludicrous nature of the comedy makes it cheerful and refreshing, and the disingenuous leads make for some madcap foolishness that mixes American teen comedy with elements of old-style black-and-white farce - the 'taking out the rubbish' scene with the dropped bottle top does this beautifully. There is also a touch of the detatched, Austin Powers style, and anyone who liked Mike Myers' work would probably get most out of 'Dude, Where's My Car?'. Like I said, though, it doesn't quite make the grade of 'Porky's', etc, for a few reasons. The calamitous side of the film doesn't quite come off because of our lack of interest in the characters. In 'American Pie', for example, there is an agonising build-up to each of Biggs' misfortunes which the audience are really sucked into. Chester and Jesse in 'Dude', though, are not built up as individuals in the slightest. Now you may say quite rightly that this is hardly the film that needs deep depictions of the thought process of each character, but making the parts completely two-dimensional is a mistake. The set-piece gags still work, but for the film as a whole to be engaging and slick, not only does it need a more flowing, dynamic script, but we need to have just that tiny iota of character detail to keep us truly entertained as well as simply content, even if it is totally puerile stuff we're looking for in general. And about that script. Again, some of the set-pieces are great, and it's a matter of fact that the script's not predictable in the slightest, but it still alienates occasionally. The 'and then' Chinese restuarant and the 'Dude\/Sweet' tattoo scenes just wound me up. Comedy of this sort needs to be more quickfire, and not fall into the Austin Powers trap of laughing at its own jokes, as this film seems to do too often. Basically, this film aims for a niche audience, and doesn't hit it. The movie doesn't have drama, tension, depth or anything remotely sophisticated, but that doesn't matter in itself - what matters is that 'Dude, Where's My Car?' is just that tiny bit too shallow, too indifferent and too insipid to provide the laugh-fest that a premise like this (and it is a very nifty idea for a film) should produce. Of course, this doesn't make it unwatchable. If you want something to engage you, don't watch it. If you want some really great comedy, don't watch it. If you disapprove of the smutty filth that's on TV today, don't watch it (and also get a life). If you want something deep and meaningful, don't watch it. If you've got a brain cell dying to be used, don't watch it. Watch it if you've got a pizza to eat and some beer to drink, most of which you will later fling around the room like the free spirit you are. Above all, watch it without any great expectations, just being prepared to take the laughs as it comes. Not a bad shot from the interesting work-out-what-happened-as-you-go angle. Guaranteed to entertain people whose parents wouldn't approve of them seeing it, and also anyone who likes stoner jokes.

This is a beautiful love story between two of the most unlikely people.

As much as I use to love Gwyneth Paltrow, I have to admit that her British characters are starting to get on my nerves.  She was perfect as Viola in Shakespeare In Love and I admired her in Sliding Doors, but I think another actress (maybe a slightly more bookish looking one) would have been more interesting in this role.  The same goes for Aaron Eckhart who's way to brash and handsome to be believable as a literary nut who is so broken-hearted about past romances that he refuses to have sex with a horny Gwyneth.  Please!  I think the best sequences are the flashbacks to Ash and LaMotte played by Jeremy Northam and Jennifer Ehle. Their story is definitely believable but still a little boring.  I truly believe that this is one of those movies that gets lots of critical acclaim simply because it is unlike everything else out and for no other reason than that.

Sure, a lot of his movies are pretty much bottom of the barrel drivel, such as many of his earlier horror films (such as Creepshow and Night Shift and It, to some extent), but there is a distinct brand of horror films that come from his books that are not only better than average, but that stand as classic horror films and probably always will (such as The Shining and Carrie). It should also be noted that Stephen King has not only come out with horror stories, but that he has come out with some of the best dramas out there. Note, for example, that The Shawshank Redemption is at #2 on the IMDb's Top 250, and has been for as long as I can remember, and he has also provided the stories for such great dramas as Stand By Me, Hearts In Atlantis, Dolores Claiborne, The Green Mile, and Strawberry Spring (MAN I can't wait until that movie comes out&#133;). Clearly, Stephen King has earned enough respect to have filmmakers be faithful to his material when adapting one of his stories into a film, but while that is the case with Thinner, I just don't think the material translates very well.It's not exactly one of King's best books ever, but Thinner is an entertaining and fast paced novel. It's one of those ones where something new is always happening and it's really hard to put down, which is why it seemed so strange to me that while I was watching the movie I seemed to be just waiting for it to end. I had already read the book, so I wasn't exactly hanging on the edge of my seat to see what happened next, but there's something thin (no pun intended) about the delivery of the movie that took away from the excitement of the story as a whole. This is not a typical horror film, in that it doesn't really rely on shocks to get you to jump out of your seat, it relies more on just horrifying stuff, like Billy Halleck's torturous weight loss and the old gypsy man's nose and that KISS at the end of the movie my GOD. Unfortunately, the film version of Thinner just doesn't capture the fascinating quality of the book. My theory is that this is the kind of thing that is much better imagined than seen. You just can't show something like this and have it be convincing enough to be a really great film. Granted, the special effects are impressive, to say the least, but there are many instances in the film where it's just all too obvious that they are just that &#150; special effects.Robert John Burke's performance was less than spectacular at some points, even once or twice bordering on becoming clownish (`I'm being&#133;erased!'), but I haven't seen many of his performances before (except for his performance in the ridiculous RoboCop 3), so I don't even have much to compare it to. Joe Mantegna is completely out of place in this film and pretty much the rest of the cast is on auto-pilot. The film is worth watching just to see Kari Wuhrer lift her skirt up in one of the most breathless but unrevealing scenes I've ever seen (rivaling even the tremendous sensuality despite the nearly total lack of nudity in The Hairdresser's Husband), and Stephen King fans are sure to enjoy it, but this is not a King film for a wide audience.

After Columbine, anything involving guns and black overcoats was frowned upon, and so beings the story of the BOONDOCK SAINTS.  I bought this movie on advice from a friend who told me it was good.  GOOD, my friends, is an understatement.This movie follows the story of two Irish brothers living in an Irish neighborhood.  They are very religious and church-faring.  When they attend a sermon one day, about how a good man's indifference is just as bad as an evil man, it plants a seed in them.  Pretty soon the Russian mafia starts strong-arming their way into their neighborhood, our two brothers are left with only one choice, action, over indifference.  So the movie unfolds and we follow our brothers through a movie which is told in outstanding fashion. We get to see them many times getting ready for a huge action sequence, and then the movie cuts away and we see the crime scene afterwards being ran through by FBI agent Paul Smecker (Dafoe of Spiderman fame).  He examines each bloody scene and then tells the local police, and the audience just what transpired... and this is a real treat for us.  You have to just see these scenes unfold to truly appreciate them.  I have not quite seen another movie that unfolds quite like BDS and does it with such outstanding results!The other great thing about this movie is its dialog and acting.  There are some fantastic lines in this movie.  You will find yourself repeating them over and over again... where you going... NOWHERE!!!  You will soon be chanting the family prayer and writing Aequitas and Veritas all over yourself or scratch paper whenever you get the chance... and this movie is sure to inspire a few tattoos.

This movie is truly one you will want to see over and over again... and when you factor in that the DVD from Fox can be purchased for around $12 it should be in everyone's collection.  It is one of the best action movies around, with the most style (rivaling pulp fiction) and best action around.  That tied in with its spiritual overtones, makes for one heck of a rollercoaster ride that you will want to see again and again.  I urge you to give Boondock Saints a chance.  It has risen to within my top 5 of all time, and I know you will not be disappointed. Finally... a sequel is in the making, so for all of you who have or plan on seeing BDS and haven't had enough... the whole clan should be back for another awesome flick in, Boondock II The Second Coming!

I have not quite seen another movie that unfolds quite like BDS and does it with such outstanding results!The other great thing about this movie is its dialog and acting.  There are some fantastic lines in this movie.  You will find yourself repeating them over and over again... where you going... NOWHERE!!!  You will soon be chanting the family prayer and writing Aequitas and Veritas all over yourself or scratch paper whenever you get the chance... and this movie is sure to inspire a few tattoos. See it once and you'll know what I'm talking about. Once, however, is simply not enough.  Sean Patrick Flannery and Norman Reedus give outstanding performances and make us truly believe that they care for each other as brothers (toilet scene), and that they have a divine mandate to kill the killers.  The movie raises a good point... that we've all wished at one time or another that someone would take out the trash so to speak.  That's what Connor and Murphy excel at.   Without giving much more away, I want to just leave you with one final note...Upon purchasing this DVD about 3 weeks ago... my friends and I have watched BDS about 8 times!  This movie is truly one you will want to see over and over again... and when you factor in that the DVD from Fox can be purchased for around $12 it should be in everyone's collection.  It is one of the best action movies around, with the most style (rivaling pulp fiction) and best action around.  That tied in with its spiritual overtones, makes for one heck of a rollercoaster ride that you will want to see again and again.  I urge you to give Boondock Saints a chance.  It has risen to within my top 5 of all time, and I know you will not be disappointed. Finally... a sequel is in the making, so for all of you who have or plan on seeing BDS and haven't had enough... the whole clan should be back for another awesome flick in, Boondock II The Second Coming! I know I'm excited!!!!  ","genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller"}]
