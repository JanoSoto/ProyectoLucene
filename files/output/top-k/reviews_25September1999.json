[{"date":"25 September 1999","score":"","review":" I saw the much awaited and ballyhooed FOR THE LOVE OF THE GAME starring Kevin Costner in his third baseball film. This time he is an aging veteran pitcher which should not be confused with the aging catcher that he portrayed in the superior BULL DURHAM or surely should not be confused with aging outfielder played by Robert Redford in the much superior THE NATURAL.  I guess, like the character Costner played in the third baseball film, FIELD OF DREAMS, film makers believe that if it's baseball and Costner makes it they will come.  If they do it will be unfortunate.  I admit I am a nut for baseball films. The before mentioned NATURAL, EIGHT MEN OUT and Ray Milland's golden oldie IT HAPPENS EVERY SPRING are among some of my favorites.  I looked forward to this new one with eager anticipation and I was unfortunately greatly disappointed.  A pitcher throwing a perfect game (retiring 27 batters without anyone getting on base) is a rare feat indeed. The premise of this film is that Costner late in his career, late in the season in a meaningless game to his cellar dwelling Detroit Tigers facing the Yankees about to clinch their pennant, he throws one. Preposterous you might well say?  This is Hollywood do not forget and baseball is the stuff from which dreams come.  I suppose that this premise is no more or less ridiculous than a man building a baseball diamond in an Iowa corn field to give the 1919 Chicago Black Sox a second try or a professor of chemistry discovering a chemical substance that makes a baseball avoid wood.  So I was more than willing to suspend my disbelief that this could and as I knew, would indeed happen. What made the story unique, I thought prior to viewing it, was the fact that Costner relives in his mind, his life, while he is pitching the BIG game.  I still believe that this premise could work.  The problem with FOR THE LOVE OF THE GAME is Costner's life away from the diamond is a big drag. Kelly Preston as his on again-off again girl friend is the biggest problem.  We simply don't give a damn about her.  She is such a neurotic, little whining fool, we want her to just get on the plane to England and get out of the movie.   Their relationship is stupid, terrible and we keep saying why would they want each other. The baseball scenes are terrific, but hardly worth the seven bucks.  I can only hope that Costner, like the aging baseball pitcher he plays, retires from making anymore baseball movies at least ones like FOR THE LOVE OF THE GAME.

Babe is my favorite character in the movie. Most of what she says and does are my favorite scenes and quotes.  The three sisters come to reunion to give emotional support to Babe. The movie is set in the South and the southern accent is there, especially when they say Babe, Babe! This is a brilliant script nominated for an Academy Award for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium by Pulitzer Prizewinning play,  Beth Henley.  The movie is mostly filmed in a house. I love that concept because it inspires writers and emerging film makers that one does not need a fortune to make a great movie. Especially if you are a woman. We like to talk, do our nails and hair.  That is female bonding.  This movie is raises very important issues (1) mental health, because there is a history of depression in the family.  Their mother committed suicide by hanging herself with the old yellow cat.  Babe is trying to do the same thing. She has the most hysterical approaches. Then she kept talking about her mother as a transference of her own feelings of depression. (2) Racism, a white woman from the South having an affair with a black young man under age; (3) Physical abuse, Babe was abused by her husband. That is why she shot him. (4) Meg is aging and the sisters kept talking about whether Meg was still a virgin. (5) the aging grandfather, etc.  This a gem of a movie! I have the tape and watch from time to time.

I must admit I wasnt a big fan of the first one, and I didnt expect too much of the second.  You would think that all the SMART pretty young things, who spout off all the way through the film their knowledge of horror movies, would simply leave town for couple of weeks until the murderer was captured.  The Killer in the Scream series must be the biggest joke going, for all the amazing things he does like chasing down police cars and killing two armed cops, you would think that he would be able to chase someone through a house without clumsily tripping up over everything and anything.

It takes a real hit on Catholicism, and at times, religion in general. Obviously, Stigmata isn't a film for all audiences, people with strong religious beliefs, for instance, and is certainly not appropriate for younger viewers. The production has so many good qualities, it's a shame to ultimately conceive that the flaw that sunk the motion picture is not its story or characters, but the individual scenes themselves.  I can compare this film's failure to a jigsaw puzzle in which there are many interestingly shaped and colorful pieces, but, unfortunately, they do not fit together to create a final piece of work.\tThe filmmakers are hard at work here, including the production designers who, feature attractive, idealistic and convincing set designs and interesting prop use. The audience does buy the film as biblical territory. And with this to their credit, they should have gone way over the top with the touchy subject Stigmata deals with. Well, they do indeed take the plot the extra mile here, and quite graphically at times, may I add. But they go so far over the top at times, the filmmakers have nowhere to go after the scenes of aggressiveness. Those instances in the movie change tone rather rapidly. This is due to the very high peak of tension created. Therefore, the film has nowhere to go but downhill, giving us an overall production that has about a half dozen really scary moments that last about thirty seconds each, and the rest of the movie is just mediocre melodrama.\tThe film opens with an acclaimed and dedicated Priest\/scientist named Andrew Kiernan investigating a bizarre occurrence in a Brazilian church where a religious statue bled from its eyes. After noticing a few unique things in this town, however, after he returns home to Cardinal Daniel Houseman, Kiernan pleads to be sent back to this area to investigate further, but his requests are suspiciously denied. \tThe film then jumps to another story, where a young atheist woman named Frankie Paige lives an independent life in Pittsburgh where she is occupied as a hair stylist with her fellow coworkers, including close friend Donna.\tThings drastically heat up for Frankie after she receives a rather significant gift from her mother who was shopping on vacation. This is an item from a salesperson off the streets whom himself stole from a dead Brazilian priest. Soon, Frankie begins to suffer violent, disturbing visions and appearing on her afterwards are wounds resembling the ones suffered by Christ, a symptom called  the stigmata. \tThis is where the Priest comes in. After more and more stigmata attacks are inflicted on Frankie, Kiernan is sent to Pittsburgh where he investigates. It is when Frankie explains to Kiernan that she does not believe in God when he then denies the occurring stigmata attacks on her. You see, usually the stigmata happens to deeply religious Catholics, and Frankie is anything but. On the other hand, never before has each one of the five stigmatic wounds taken place on one individual person, and by the time this film is over, guess how many Frankie will have suffered. \tI liked the film's characters, as did I the performances. It is interesting for me to see such a shallow character as Frankie Paige be caught right in the middle of such a deep, spiritual situation. And who better to play the character than the always entertaining Patricia Arquette, who dazzled earlier this year in Goodbye, Lover, and now, with Stigmata, plays Paige with the right sarcasm material. \tThis is not to say that Stigmata is perfect in its use of characters--as a madder of fact, the film is characteristically flawed. Take, for instance, Frankie's  best friend, Donna, who at first is present to serve as a companion for Frankie. Then, right in the middle of the movie, when the script no longer required her presence, she completely disappears without a trace. Why does this happen? Because the story gets too involved for the characters to have buddies, making the rest of the characters, although not completely, puppets of the plot. \tStigmata contains the kind of plot that I liked to experience; a deep, involved and revealing storyline that focuses on touchy subjects. The characters are lost in their dialogue, but if the audience buys the premise, they allow themselves to be sucked in the events that transpire. The person who I saw this movie with found the plot too absorbing for her, and I have a feeling that this is how the majority of an audience will feel, therefore, although it is a close call for me,  I am not recommending the film. I do feel, however, that there is a group of individuals out there who, like I somewhat was able to do, will happen to enjoy this production for what it is worth. If the film fit together a bit more, I think there may have been much potential here.

It's called The Blair Witch Project, and it has received almost as much hype as that long-awaited first entry in the Star Wars saga.  Make no mistake about it; the Blair Witch is definitely something to marvel at, even if it's more for its utter stupidity than anything else.  Filmed in 16mm black-and-white, The Blair Witch Project is filmed like a documentary.  After about five minutes of watching the camera wobble from the ground to the sky and back to the ground again, the viewer is overcome by a splitting headache and a desperate urge to vomit.  Actually, much of the film is spent with the camera directed at the ground, leaving the viewer to wonder if the filmmakers were looking for the Blair Witch or merely looking for rare species of ants.  With a running length of 87 minutes, approximately 75 minutes of this time is consumed with the student filmmakers, who are the center of this lowly production, running around in the woods, lost, screaming obscenities at each other.  One is left to wonder that if they would have shut up and actually walked for a little while, they would probably have stumbled upon a strip mall within 5 minutes. But that obviously wouldn't be interesting enough. So forward we trek with our documentary crew, fully absorbed in the frightening reality of their situation.  While the threesome soon run out of food and supplies, the camera continues to roll, as if it's powered by a nuclear generator.  I don't want to give away any more details about this fright-fest, but let's just say that the three leads in this film are intolerable at best, and are representative of everything that the youth of America stands for incessant chain-smoking and rampant profanity.

After about 30 minutes, however, I was hoping that a fellow audience member would feel as cheated as I, and do everyone a favor and go on a mass killing spree in the theater.  The producers wish to promote this film by saying that it is the unseen terror in The Blair Witch Project that makes it so darn scary.

This could have been a contender,but it falls short in so many ways. The premise of the story is fascinating-people living in a dream universe created by computer,while in reality they are created and used as a source of energy to power the computers. This concept was not very fully explored and I found Morpheuss (Lawrence Fishburne the leader of the rebels who knows the truth)explaination of the rules of the Matrix flawed. Instead a deep thought provoking movie,the premise demands-what we get is a shoot-em-up,and a Hollywood ending.This movie was mildly entertaining,in spite of Keanu Reeves,but its not great sci-fi. I gave it a 4.

Times have changed and have passed him by.  His solution?  Simply let go of responsibility and live out the dreams and desires of his youth. He may be older but he's got the money to do it and nothing to lose.  Or so he thinks.  Burnhams wife (Annette Benning) is too high on her own career aspirations to take notice of her husbands midlife crisis of sorts.  Having totally embraced her role as a nineties woman exploring the limits of gender equality while actually undergoing a role reversal as the main bread winner of the family, she is essentially blind to her husband's dilemma.  The few glimpses she does get she matches with threats of divorce, to which her husband reminds her just how much her present career has been leveraged by his own self sacrifice.  And of course, stuck in the middle is the daughter who considers her father's recent behavior changes as downright creepy, especially since her teenage girlfriend is ground zero for his youthful fantasies.But what makes the story truly fascinating is the character of Ricky Fitts, the Burnhams teenage neighbor whose interest in filming the world around him extends into the private world of the Burnhams.  He alone is in a position to understand, in his own unique way, the problems of the Burnhams.  His video recorder is like a key that allows him to capture what is missed by many the hidden beauty in nature and people, just waiting to be shared and absorbed by the voyeur. Similar to Mrs. Burnham, Ricky's dad has also been a victim to his career (as an ex marine colonel). Yet like Mr. Burnham, he has been left behind by changing times his utter contempt for his homosexual neighbors, who the film wonderfully portrays as really the only truly happy and normal people in the local neighborhood, despite how society may view their sexuality.Mrs Fitts is just the opposite of Mrs. Burnham, she has been frozen in time, probably a time more familiar to the fifties, and is totally subservient to her husband's world. She is basically a zombie, with none of Mrs. Burnhams dreams or goals, but like Mrs Burnham she is without the essential emotions to understand what is happening in the world because she is locked up in hers.The film doesn't offer the viewer any new insight into life, only confirms what we probably feel or have felt.  But it does so in a manner that's very fresh.  It doesn't preach to us the way things should be, rather it puts a cross section of life under the microscope to be dissected and analyzed.  American Beauty could have been a little shorter I think, and some parts seemed to drag out the message a little too long, but the acting, especially Spacey is very good.

MUMFORD the character is a man sort of like THE GREAT IMPOSTER, a film that Tony Curtis starred in back in the 60's.  Like the Curtis character, he discovers during his stay at a monastery that he wants to have a new life, so he invents one. The update is that drugs have driven him to seek asylum with the good padres in the desert.

His training as an IRS agent, the life he left for drugs, shows him how to create the person known as Mumford, including all of the phony credentials that he needs to pass as a doctor. When he looks on a map and sees the town of Mumford, somewhere in idyllic, pastoral,  America, we are never sure just where, he thinks that's an omen, that's the place where I belong. The odd thing is, he does help people.  All of the folks he treats, get better from his listening and applying his very down to earth logical approach. The performances by a rather star studded cast are wonderful, but the screenplay and the direction are just so slow moving you want to die.  If it were REALLY the best comedy of the year I would have been laughing and that might have kept me interested in this guy, but as it turned out I didn't give a damn.

My problem I guess is that I have seen a lot of sci-fi movies and TV shows. So, basic plot retreads do not excite me. The beginning of The Matrix starts out like Scanners (1981) introducing people who have incredible powers. Then it shifts to the virtual reality, world is illusion, phase (done at least 50 times on the various Star Trek series and Virtuosity, 1995; Strange Days, 1995, etc.). Then comes the machines take over humanity surprise (Star Trek First Contact-the Borg and Terminator 2). The rebels in the Matrix are looking for a Messianic leader (check out the original Terminator). How about showing some original style? I recommend Dark City (1998) which accomplishes this very well. The Matrix is a blend of Blade (1998) and Terminator 2. We have acrobatic actors firing machine guns in slow motion, big deal. Does the plot make sense? Sometimes, but it is very inconsistent. The idea that the machine\/bad guys would fight with guns in the virtual reality world is absurd. This is a computer controlled reality after all of the 22nd century. Why limit yourself to clunky guns? How about some decent dialogue? The love interest in this film is a joke. Trinity's (Carrie-Anne Moss) lines at the end of the film are terrible. You want an excellent heroine? Try Linda Hamilton in the Terminator films.  Between the posing and posturing and the fight scenes what is being said by the crew most of the time is pretty lame. You want to see good scenes of a crew under pressure? Try the first two Alien movies.What is there to like about The Matrix? The editing, sound, camera work, stunts and computer graphics are good. Lawrence Fishburne turns in a fine performance as usual. Also, all of the action and special effects are able to cover for Keanu Reeves who turns in a flat performance as usual. Briefly, in the middle of the film when the pace slowed in a scene with the oracle the characters and plot became a bit more interesting. But then it was lock and load time.What really bothers me about The Matrix is that this mediocre retread is rated higher by imdb members than these great films; Blade Runner (1982), Alien (1979), Aliens (1986) and Terminator 2 which is outrageous.

My problem I guess is that I have seen a lot of sci-fi movies and TV shows. So, basic plot retreads do not excite me. The beginning of The Matrix starts out like Scanners (1981) introducing people who have incredible powers. Then it shifts to the virtual reality, world is illusion, phase (done at least 50 times on the various Star Trek series and Virtuosity, 1995; Strange Days, 1995, etc.). Then comes the machines take over humanity surprise (Star Trek First Contact-the Borg and Terminator 2). The rebels in the Matrix are looking for a Messianic leader (check out the original Terminator). How about showing some original style? I recommend Dark City (1998) which accomplishes this very well. The Matrix is a blend of Blade (1998) and Terminator 2. We have acrobatic actors firing machine guns in slow motion, big deal. Does the plot make sense? Sometimes, but it is very inconsistent. The idea that the machine\/bad guys would fight with guns in the virtual reality world is absurd. This is a computer controlled reality after all of the 22nd century. Why limit yourself to clunky guns? How about some decent dialogue? The love interest in this film is a joke. Trinity's (Carrie-Anne Moss) lines at the end of the film are terrible. You want an excellent heroine? Try Linda Hamilton in the Terminator films.  Between the posing and posturing and the fight scenes what is being said by the crew most of the time is pretty lame. You want to see good scenes of a crew under pressure? Try the first two Alien movies.What is there to like about The Matrix? The editing, sound, camera work, stunts and computer graphics are good. Lawrence Fishburne turns in a fine performance as usual. Also, all of the action and special effects are able to cover for Keanu Reeves who turns in a flat performance as usual. Briefly, in the middle of the film when the pace slowed in a scene with the oracle the characters and plot became a bit more interesting. But then it was lock and load time.What really bothers me about The Matrix is that this mediocre retread is rated higher by imdb members than these great films; Blade Runner (1982), Alien (1979), Aliens (1986) and Terminator 2 which is outrageous. The Matrix does not belong in the top 200 movies. This will take care of itself in a few years because this oracle predicts that by 2010 hardly anybody will care about this film.

Private Ryan-the film that made us appreciate our veterans and understand why our parents wouldn't talk about 'it' all these years-is not as good as Shakespeare In Love?  Neither dramatic nor very funny, Shakespeare in Love makes a mockery of history and Gwenyth Paltrow gives a performance worthy of abhorring as Viola De Lesseps.  The minute she comes on screen, you sense the phoniness of the performance, and by the end of the movie you realize this vexatious twit has done basically nothing to inspire Shakespeare besides f**king him every once and a while.  Oh yes, let me run out and write the best play every to grace the page cuz i just got laid.  Nope, don't think so.  When it comes down to it, Shakespeare in Love is really a movie hinging on one big premise with nothing to back it up, and it wears out fast.  With only a handful of good one-liners and performances from both Rush, Paltrow, Affleck, and Firth that all quickly wear out their welcome, I don't see how anyone could find this poorly assembled piece of celluloid better than the massive and heart-wrenching epic Saving Private Ryan.  Ask anyone of those Shakespeare in Love 'fans' out there why Judi Dench won Best Supporting Actress.  Watch them not be able to answer it.  She's on screen for 8 minutes at most, and half the time the audience is supposed to just sit and marvel in her wonderful makeup and costumes.  Do you want to know the number one reason why Shakespeare in Love was a bad movie?  It was written by the guy who did Cutthroat Island.  The other writer was the guy who wrote Brazil.  Brazil was a great movie mind you, but it was a movie without a point; a psychological rush.  If you cross a science fiction acid trip of a movie and a film where Geena Davis plays a pirate, do you really think you're going to get an Oscar-worthy epic picture?  Skip this travesty of a film and move elsewhere...this film doesn't deserve to be called a drama OR a comedy, let alone Best Picture.  I hope all have lost faith in the Academy.

Michael Cimino always fit the description of the pretentious, egotistical pseudo-auteur to a 'T,' and Heaven's Gate confirms that more than any of his other films. Cimino basically takes a real historical incident and grafts a neo-Marxist framework on it to create your typical Greedy Industrialists vs. Hard-Working Western Folk story that was done with more depth and ingenuity in Altman's McCabe and Mrs. Miller. I've got no problem with leftist pontificating -- Godard's films are among my favorites -- but Cimino more or less saves it for the end and occupies the remaining three or so hours with what is more or less your traditional, antiquated love triangle, with loads of nudity, a graphic rape scene, and tons of gore which were seemingly included simply to ramp up the film's commercial potential (which isn't too far from the truth). Other, less significant problems serve to bring this lumbering oxcart further down into the mire, such as the scenes at Harvard, which are pathetic not only because Kristofferson is desperately trying to look like a man in his young 20s (looking even less convincing than Diana Ross as Dorothy in The Wiz) but because it was filmed at Oxford, which has never had so much as one jot of resemblance to Harvard. I feel kind of sorry for Cimino; I still think the guy had some untapped talent that was never realized thanks to this film's critical and commercial savaging. But ultimately, I simply can't side with the revisionist critics who claim this movie is one of those hugely underrated masterpieces.
