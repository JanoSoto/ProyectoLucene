Fatal Attraction is a stylish, suspenseful, and in many cases plausible thriller that was perhaps a wake-up call to cheating husbands of the time. Michael Douglas plays a young yuppie lawyer who seems happily married with a pretty wife and daughter. At a trendy 80s Japanese-themed sushi\/cocktail party, he casually hits on an attractive (well, kinda attractive for that time) woman played by Glenn Close. She happens to work for a publisher that his firm represents. Shortly after, his wife and kids leave the city for the weekend. Douglas and Close end up hooking up after a Saturday office meeting. They pretty much have sex the entire weekend. Nobody did angry, aggressive sex scenes like Michael Douglas. His breathy couplings with Close probably won him the parts in Basic Instinct and Disclosure, too. Some of them are somewhat elaborate involving elevators, pots and pans, water... maybe these were outtakes from 9 1\/2 weeks which had the same director. I guess for the 1980s they were hot. Now we don't even get sex scenes in most movies, so maybe we should treasure these. Anyway, Douglas knows he screwed up, and just wants to forget the whole thing. Close, on the other hand is possessive, clearly crazy, and has no intention of letting Douglas go on his merry way. She begins calling his home and office relentlessly, stalking him and his family, and even tracking them upstate to their new home in the country. The more he tries to get clear of her, the crazier she becomes.... and the more this screenplay jumps the rails. Oh, and she claims to be pregnant with his child, too.The film is just too well-crafted to turn away from. It is beautifully photographed, well-paced, and suspenseful when it needs to be. Director Lyne also knows how to handle smaller, and subtler moments. Notice the scenes where Douglas just watches his wife and child interact as mommy and child often do. Whether reading a story, or practicing for a school play these moments are enough to remind him what is at stake due to his fooling around. The conclusion, which was re-shot as the original one failed with test audiences, is generally satisfying. Even if it feels a little too violent and out of place with most of the rest of the film.The film loses points with some truly incredulous scenes that are just way too improbable and are more of a distraction. These would involve the boiling of a pet rabbit, and an inexplicable trip to an amusement park by Close and the little girl while her mother frantically drives around town looking for her. Some bright staff they must have at the girl's school! And I was also struck by a quick shot of a handgun in a desk drawer at the Douglas home. True, their lives are in danger, but a loaded handgun in a desk drawer where their child could easily find it? Gun owners like this make it hard for the rest of us who do it safely. The whole movie is worth about 7 of 10 stars. It was a major money-maker back in the day.The Hound.

The truth of the matter is that this film isn't as terrible as the hype states it is. Being the first Hollywood adaption of a video game series, and being different from it's source material, there wasn't really anything to compare it to. If you were hoping for a genuine conversion of the game's storyline into a movie, then you are going to be highly disappointed - but then you've made a rather rash assumption that the basic story of the game series would work as a film to begin with. Movies need to be like epic events, a major moment of the character's lives cataloged within an hour and a half (minimum). The game's theme of 'Bowser has the Princess, run into castle and have toad say Your Princess is in another castle 7 or 8 times before the end' doesn't make for a good film.Excuses aside, the film does succeed in the way it intends to. It is extremely fun. Unlike other films with it's reputation, the Super Mario Bros Movie is genuinely enjoyable and even more so thanks to the few downfalls in it's script. Bob Hoskins cracks me up as Mario Get Your Belt on Kid! We're going' in!, and Dennis Hopper is clearly the inspiration for Doctor Evil from Austin Powers See you later, Alligator. The movie manages to do something few films manage - it improves with age. I'm not going to state that it's as superb as Blade Runner (As stated on the box), because they're from two very different worlds. Blade Runner is a classic in terms of being a thought-provoking high-caliber sci-fi drama, Super Mario is a classic in terms of being a cheesy fun-fueled thrill-ride. The only reason these two were compared in the first place was the similarity of a run-down ugly futuristic city, both of which were furnished with surprisingly high quality set design and standards. I would love to see a full Blu-Ray restoration of this movie because there is so much intricate work done on the backgrounds and in the details that the additional quality Blu-Ray affords would allow us even more joy. There are some good jokes in here, the pace is good and never slacks, and while there are some bad script- writing problems the enjoyment should allow most people to gloss over those issues without much problem (Look at Star Trek 2009, horrific script, plot holes and some truly terrible Hollywood writing but because it was so fun and full of action, it is hailed as a great film). This makes it more closely related to being the Star Trek 09 movie of its day, with special effects that were (at the time) really impressive and a mixture of family humor and more adult action (Bob Hoskins sticking his face in a black woman's chest - golden).I would love to see a restored Blu-Ray of this movie, as it is a great fun movie. It is more fun than many more recent video game based movies (The Resident Evil series is stale, the Degeneration movie was miss-able, the Final Fantasy films were badly directed, they even got it wrong with Yakuza Like A Dragon...), most are bland (Something nobody could say about Super Mario Bros, whether they like it or not) or outright horrific, especially if made by Uwe Boll. Super Mario Bros is not the best movie ever made, but it never intended to be. It wasn't supposed to be a movie epic like Blade Runner or 2001 A Space Odyssey, nor was it supposed to be a direct translation of the game, which in itself would have been far worse and less enjoyable. It was intended to stand on its own two feet as a fun, family-oriented action movie with darker sci-fi undertones and while it never accomplishes them to perfection, it certainly succeeded well enough to continuously provide a fun and entertaining movie experience.Some ideas are quite cool, others are a little childish, but that tends to come with the territory with family-friendly Hollywood movies. Again, now more than ever, Nintendo are family-oriented and their Wii console is centered around allowed the kids in as much as the teens and adults - another sign of this film being more accurate now than it was even at the time of its release.As for possible Blu-Ray extras, I would adore an audio commentary by Bob Hoskins with him just hating on the film. You can imagine that would be a funny commentary. The Raw Deal Blu-Ray has an HD extra of a movie critic slating the movie. He-man DVDs have fan-commentaries ragging on the quality of the episodes while still speaking fondly of the series they adore. If the extras on these don't harm the sales, then the same thing for Super Mario Bros would only raise the sales of this film as people would be keen to hear what he has to say since his outbursts on the movie in the media. Other extras can include original script outlines and differences, several deleted scenes and the possibility of a re-cut.I hope to see a decent Blu-Ray release of this movie soon. They've got Blu-Ray releases of Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat and other video game movies of the era, Super Mario deserves at least the same.

This makes it more closely related to being the Star Trek 09 movie of its day, with special effects that were (at the time) really impressive and a mixture of family humor and more adult action (Bob Hoskins sticking his face in a black woman's chest - golden).I would love to see a restored Blu-Ray of this movie, as it is a great fun movie. It is more fun than many more recent video game based movies (The Resident Evil series is stale, the Degeneration movie was miss-able, the Final Fantasy films were badly directed, they even got it wrong with Yakuza Like A Dragon...), most are bland (Something nobody could say about Super Mario Bros, whether they like it or not) or outright horrific, especially if made by Uwe Boll. Super Mario Bros is not the best movie ever made, but it never intended to be. It wasn't supposed to be a movie epic like Blade Runner or 2001 A Space Odyssey, nor was it supposed to be a direct translation of the game, which in itself would have been far worse and less enjoyable. It was intended to stand on its own two feet as a fun, family-oriented action movie with darker sci-fi undertones and while it never accomplishes them to perfection, it certainly succeeded well enough to continuously provide a fun and entertaining movie experience.Some ideas are quite cool, others are a little childish, but that tends to come with the territory with family-friendly Hollywood movies. Again, now more than ever, Nintendo are family-oriented and their Wii console is centered around allowed the kids in as much as the teens and adults - another sign of this film being more accurate now than it was even at the time of its release.As for possible Blu-Ray extras, I would adore an audio commentary by Bob Hoskins with him just hating on the film. You can imagine that would be a funny commentary. The Raw Deal Blu-Ray has an HD extra of a movie critic slating the movie. He-man DVDs have fan-commentaries ragging on the quality of the episodes while still speaking fondly of the series they adore. If the extras on these don't harm the sales, then the same thing for Super Mario Bros would only raise the sales of this film as people would be keen to hear what he has to say since his outbursts on the movie in the media. Other extras can include original script outlines and differences, several deleted scenes and the possibility of a re-cut.I hope to see a decent Blu-Ray release of this movie soon. They've got Blu-Ray releases of Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat and other video game movies of the era, Super Mario deserves at least the same.

The film The Age of Innocence was among them. Around 2000 I watched it quite a number of times, and was deeply moved by the social and emotional atmosphere. I tried to analyze the dialogs, which are evidently ambiguous on the psychological level. I even read the book by Edith Wharton, which closely resembles the film. Or to be more precise, the film manages to give a very accurate portrayal of the book. At the time I empathized with the dilemma of the main male character, Newland Archer, namely the impossible choice between two very different women. Today to my surprise I found it unpleasant to see The Age of Innocence again. The narrative and the characters irritated me, and I had to force myself to watch the thing until its end. Since the film has not changed, it must be my new perspective on such matters. I find the moaning and whining of Archer, and his wives May (true) and Ellen (off the record) disgusting and crooked. This does not mean, that I question the credibility of the story. On the contrary, three-cornered love affairs are probably fairly common. I am sure that it is possible to make a psycho-analysis of the characters, that would make their behavior rational. My problem is, that as distinct from a twelve years ago I am no longer prepared to indulge in this psycho-analysis. It is just not a theme. The appearance of the relations is simply too tragic. The situations of the main characters are devoid of hope, and nevertheless they seem to find their fate agreeable. Thus their mental states look utterly ill. Should the inability of Archer to make a choice not motivate him to abandon both women? For it is obvious that neither May or Ellen gives him complete satisfaction.A decade ago I did not yet grasp the importance of the society on the fate of the main characters. It may be that Archer and his wives should broaden their social insight, but their community forbids them to do so. It is supposed to be the elite of New York, but their social circle is decaying. Archer may be an excellent advocate - I doubt it - but he is definitely bourgeois. At about the same time the economist T.B. Veblen made a study of the important families of the USA. Veblen felt, that these families and also the new rising class of large entrepreneurs were totally useless and even harmful. They led a life of wasteful ostentation and opulence, which Veblen called conspicuous consumption. This elite preferred to earn their income by means of speculation and manipulations, that where damaging to the productivity. Fortunately thanks to the instinct of workmanship of the technicians the enterprises remained healthy, which allowed the progress to continue. The picture of Veblen of the elite as an isolated class fits nicely with the decadence shown in The Age of Innocence.A nasty theme does not disqualify a film. The life in a degenerated community and its lack of progress are just unpleasant to watch.

In fact, you probably never even heard of it. I know that I didn't. Totally by accident, I saw it the other night. Fortunately.The film is based on an actual race riot that erupted in Rosewood, Florida in 1923, fueled by a false claim by a white woman living in the near by town of Sumner that she had been beaten by an African American man. Rosewood was a town owned primarily by its black residents. The woman was definitely beaten, but by her Caucasian lover who was not her Caucasian husband. She never did claim rape; the white vigilante mob did that for her. The horrific violence, and the mass murders that ensued, left the town burned to the ground, never to be rebuilt or inhabited again. There are excellent performances here. Jon Voight plays John Wright, a conflicted store owner, and one of the white few white people who lives in Rosewood. Although married to a loving, church going woman, he enjoys nailing his 17 year old black female clerk. He would later help scores of black people escape the catastrophic dimensions of hate portrayed in this film. Don Cheadle, as Sylvester Carrier, is his usual brilliant self, portraying a reasoned and reasonable man who ultimately endures. Esther Rolle, equally poignant, plays Carrier's Aunt Sarah, who does not. Bruce McGill, whose performances I always enjoy (and who you may remember as the motorcycle hood in Animal House, and more recently as the fight promoter in Cinderella Man, among other fine roles) is one of the primary racist instigators of the film. His evilness allows him to teach his son how to tie a noose. Michael Rooker plays the sheriff who never really believed the victim's story to begin with, and who tries to mitigate the tsunami of hate and the enormity of damage it extols. Rooker is a great actor. He had searing performances in Eight Men Out and in Mississippi Burning, in which incidentally, he played a racist murderer of civil rights workers. He also excelled as the murderous husband in Sea of Love. He does an excellent job in this film as well, although I do wish there were a couple of less scenes where he wasn't struggling so with his chewing tobacco. Ving Rhames inhabits a character whose name is simply Mann, suggesting a commentary on the conduct of man in general. At least I think it does. The real problem is that Rhames' character is totally made up. There is no such person. Never was. Of all the horrors outlined in this well intentioned, and for the most part well executed film, Director Singleton and screenwriter Gregory Poirer apparently felt the need to create a character, and a major one at that, who never existed. To me, that seriously undermines the film's essence and challenges its credibility. What happened at Rosewood was unspeakable. Do we really need an imaginary person to utter the unspeakable when there were real people whose real perspectives would have been more compelling?Mann is someone we really don't get to know very well. We do learn that he is a veteran of World War I and has some money. We know he has scars around his neck but we don't know how he got them. We learn that he is brave and has a good heart. Unfortunately, Rhames' performance is stilted and muffled. He speaks his lines at times as if he had just memorized them. No nuance. No believable emotion. According to the film, and to subsequent histories of the incident, the official version of events documents eight deaths. The film suggests a far more likely number, as high as 100 or so. The problem is, incredibly, after the initial national coverage of the riot, the event ceased to exist. Survivors refused to discuss what happened. Consequently, the riot was never formally documented as part of our history, not until the 1990s when members of the media began to resurrect the events. A law suit eventually ensued, resulting in Florida being the first state ordered to pay reparations to survivors and their descendants for a race riot.I suppose it is predictable that Rosewood did not make much money.

The feeling of being cut off from the world and that anything could pop out from around the corner. The acting was terrific the characters were lovable and heck you could even connect with a lot of them. There was real terror in the air.Aliens was also a big surprise to the movie going audience because it was just as good as the original (in my opinion). It took a whole different turn with things. It was just simply a horror flick anymore it was a awesome action movie. Guns and gore galore!! With super awesome characters with likable personality (and yes to an extent even Bill Paxton's character). It had a lot of issues being dealt with especially by Ripley...big issue most notably of course is Motherhood. This movie is definitely a watch if you haven't seen it...anyways on to the main movie.Alien 3 had a lot on its shoulders to begin with just right off the bat. How can one still be able to keep the audience interested after two magnificent films? Well, lets quickly look at the negative aspect of it. It's the beginning. It starts off with the ship containing Ripley, Newt, Hicks, and Bishop and it crash lands on to a prison planet. This is all due to the cause of one alien egg that was on board. First question...how the heck did it get there? Well the movie doesn't really offer and explanation to how it happened we are just suppose to go with it really.

I really feel sheltered off from the world and the total lack of technology really sets in as you get a great perspective of the world around you. The acting (again my opinion) is pretty good. Especially from Ripley herself. The music also sets a pretty eerie tone for the movie as well...most of it being choir music especially the opening scene which sets the mood immediately. This movie was also the first theatrical directorial debut of David Fincher. A Director way ahead of his time and who goes to make such great movies like Fight Club, Seven, Panic Room, Social Network, and of course the most recent remake of Girl with The Dragon Tattoo. Anyways the point I get at is that this film is definitely worth watching and deserves a higher rating than it has currently that is why i give it an eight outta ten.

And for good reason. The people that bash this movie had a right and they are entitled to their opinions because when this movie compared to the first two....it sadly does not stand very well. Let's take a step back for a minute.Alien was a revolutionary horror movie for its time. It had the right mix of Horror and Suspense put in. As well as a terrific since of claustrophobia. The feeling of being cut off from the world and that anything could pop out from around the corner. The acting was terrific the characters were lovable and heck you could even connect with a lot of them. There was real terror in the air.Aliens was also a big surprise to the movie going audience because it was just as good as the original (in my opinion). It took a whole different turn with things. It was just simply a horror flick anymore it was a awesome action movie. Guns and gore galore!! With super awesome characters with likable personality (and yes to an extent even Bill Paxton's character). It had a lot of issues being dealt with especially by Ripley...big issue most notably of course is Motherhood. This movie is definitely a watch if you haven't seen it...anyways on to the main movie.Alien 3 had a lot on its shoulders to begin with just right off the bat. How can one still be able to keep the audience interested after two magnificent films? Well, lets quickly look at the negative aspect of it. It's the beginning. It starts off with the ship containing Ripley, Newt, Hicks, and Bishop and it crash lands on to a prison planet. This is all due to the cause of one alien egg that was on board. First question...how the heck did it get there? Well the movie doesn't really offer and explanation to how it happened we are just suppose to go with it really. And with this happening it makes Aliens pointless. Guess Ripley didn't have to go back for Newt..she was just gonna die anyways. As well as helping out Bishop and Hicks. Bishop is in the film but only for a short while and he doesn't really offer much to the movie but still it is nice to see him. The second problem is some of the characters. The first two movies have memorable characters that had personality and depth. This movie has characters that for the most part go unnamed and right i can't tell you the names simply because i don't remember. I remember the main black guy...the one bald guy that survives...the a''hole leader....and the leader of Weyland Inc. oh yeah and Ripley of course. But that is the only things i cant truly find wrong with the film that really bug me. Other than that i throughly enjoy the film. The atmosphere is dark and gritty. I really feel sheltered off from the world and the total lack of technology really sets in as you get a great perspective of the world around you. The acting (again my opinion) is pretty good. Especially from Ripley herself. The music also sets a pretty eerie tone for the movie as well...most of it being choir music especially the opening scene which sets the mood immediately. This movie was also the first theatrical directorial debut of David Fincher. A Director way ahead of his time and who goes to make such great movies like Fight Club, Seven, Panic Room, Social Network, and of course the most recent remake of Girl with The Dragon Tattoo. Anyways the point I get at is that this film is definitely worth watching and deserves a higher rating than it has currently that is why i give it an eight outta ten. Oh yes and the finale of this movie is fantastic and is where the series should have ended but sadly continued on to make...gulp...Alien resurrection....which plainly sucks...a lot...anyways that's my amateur review of Alien 3...hoped it help ya some...this Amateur Reviewer...signing off.

Sure, the film is by no means great, but it runs competently enough especially compared to other film sequels in the genre and by no means feels like it should be labelled things such as Worst Film Ever.There is a decent soundtrack to this film and there are some nice visual shots and locations and everything cuts and flows nicely. The acting and direction are not dreadful, although a little shaky at times. It feels like it has some of the main ingredients to making a good horror film. However the storyline itself lets it down, as well as the film not actually being scary. It would be almost impossible for the sequel to one of the most controversial films of all time to be just as good. But it seems expectations are unrealistic.Firstly, the whole idea of the hypnosis machine was ludicrous. At one point Father Lamont and the doctor were plugged into Regan's thoughts via the machine when Regan herself was not. Also there was no need to give Regan supernatural healing powers or for there to be a Regan double. In fact Regan herself is not the real victim here and is shown that despite the possession to be walking around with no problems, it does not seem like the same demon from the first film. , and the whole locust thing is a bit lame. I guess you could argue that these points are why this is a terrible film but they merely make it an OK film. I have seen this film twice now and I was slightly entertained. There is some cheesy dialogue in the film, my favourite probably being the one quoted at the start, but I do not feel anything about this film embarrasses itself. It is alright to kill some time. Some points are quite funny but not over the top like in Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, and nowhere near as bad as some other horror films.My advice is, if you like horror sequels then this is a competent run through of a well known story and is worth watching if you are wanting to watch every film in the franchise, topped off with a nice soundtrack.If you are not really a fan of this sort of thing, but you loved The Exorcist and are hoping for the same thrills you got from watching that film, you will not find it here.Rating 5.

From the direction, to the screenplay, to the cast. Everything in this film is flawless. But, I shall go into more detail to explain this film's brilliance.Mobster films are one of my favorite film genres, and I am sure many people share that same liking. They always produce a weird sense of suspense, intrigue, and mystification. The Godfather emblazoned the mobster genre, marking a true cinematic farce and a very good milestone in film making. After the Godfather, many people tried out their hands on mobster films, but none equaled the impact and quality of the Godfather until Scorsese made Goodfellas. Goodfellas biggest quality is that it is based on a true story. This makes the film even more interesting and likable, seeing as most of the events portrayed really happened. The story of Henry Hill was a perfect foreground.On the acting side of things, there is nothing to really to complain about. The actors gave powerhouse performances, particularly Joe Pesci and Ray Liotta. Joe Pesci really gives a genuinely terrifying yet hilarious character performance. He is truly believable and ultimately ruthless. Liotta is spectacular. No more to add to that. he really showed the world that he could truly act when he did this movie. As for Robert DeNiro, he shines in every scene he is in, but my only quibble is the fact we didn't get to see more of his character. He seemed interesting, but we didn't really get any insight. Lorraine Bracco has an annoying voice, but she does give a great, passionate and sympathetic performance as Liotta's wife.The direction by Scorsese is flawless. his choices were brilliant. he really gives a documentary style of direction, as if we are there observing the everyday life of the mafia. His fade outs are poignant, and his choices for the background music are a plus.As a whole, Goodfellas gives a great insight into the mafia. It throws away the stereotypes we usually associate with those who are in the mafia, and it really has an impact.

I'm really surprised that this particular film made no headway in becoming a classic. Although people would say this film is nothing like it, why doesn't anyone see the correlation between this film and John Carpenter's Starman (1984)? The only main difference is really the setting (a snowy environment). A man is lost in a tragic accident and is incarnated once more to give hope to his family members. Is that not the same?One reason why people blame this film for being so bad is that it uses cheesy puns that are supposed to make you laugh out loud; this is false. This movie is not supposed to be a hardcore comedy. Its puns are made to create small chuckles and to appreciate the fact the man who was no more is back to set his problems right. Michael Keaton plays Jack Frost, a father who gets sidetracked from his real passion, watching his son (played by Joseph Cross) grow up because he is too focused on kick- starting his rock band. Sure so the name is cliché, but that's what makes it cute. Even Michael Keaton himself mocks the name. When he is in his snowman form, he says to himself, Why me,...why a SNOWMAN? I mean, could the universe really be that unoriginal? That made me laugh. If the main character recognizes that the name of this movie is silly then it shouldn't be as bad as everyone says. I feel that the movie's screenwriter, Mark Steven Johnson did a really nice job. Later on, he would direct Ghost Rider (2007), who I was not totally pleased with because a character as serious as Ghost Rider, should not have been so cartoonish. But here, the story of Jack Frost works well.Another thing people bash this movie for is that it has a sappy screenplay. Like there haven't been sad movies before? This isn't new people. And how often does someone get a second chance to make up his or her life mistakes. Besides, it's not like this movie ends badly; Jack Frost rights his wrongs. It's not like he shows up just to make the audience cry. The alien who plays in Starman (1984) made audiences cry too; so what's all the hoot and holler about? As for the director of this movie, Troy Miller, I assume his career hasn't been promising when it comes to big screen movies. It's a shame some good things go nowhere.As for the music, much of it is inserted when it comes to sequences of reflection. The only time the score of the film comes out when the camera is focused on Jack Frost (when he is a snowman). The score was created by Trevor Rabin who did a nice job but it disappoints me that I was not able to find the entire score digitally. One other thing I did not know was that the Jack Frost snowman was made by the Jim Henson company. I knew it looked like a Muppet somehow! It's a (pardon the pun) cool design and to make a movie look that good with a snowman must have been an interesting task.As one of the very few films that are universally known by director Troy Miller, Jack Frost is a part of his better work.

I think the depiction of the officer (Hauptmann Stransky) was historically accurate, therefore the credit goes to creators of the film for having recreated what can be believed as an historically accurate representation of war's confusion and the characters in it. The film is highly unusual in itself for viewing the events from a German perspective, But it makes up for that by drawing a very clear line between Feldwebel Steiner's platoon and the rest of the Wehrmacht. At the same time though there is no doubt for which side he's fighting for. That's why for all practical consequences there's no difference between the traditionalist Prussian officer and the &#x84;outlaw \/the good guy in the film.I wouldn't rate it as a top ranking war movie, as it contains a bit too many clichés for me. The action scenes are overplayed and terrible. A lot is left for the viewers imagination.

In that case, once I saw the original I can understand why fans were disappointed with the outcome. This movie is very sloppy and some of its characters don't even follow the original screenplay. But with a little help with the special effects and some funny characters, it doesn't turn out to be so bad as its claimed to be. As the old saying goes, if you leave your brain at the door and take it as it is, it's a fun ride.Playing as the dim-witted inspector is Matthew Broderick, who I'll say is an interesting choice because he does his job well. But for an actor who has played other characters with more intelligence, seems like the clumsy Inspector Gadget is not the right choice for him. Especially if ten years before, Broderick starred in Glory (1989), one of the most influential movies in cinema history. Another flaw in this film is sticking Dr. Claw in the light; so he is finally visible to the viewer. Who thought of that idea? If he was a concealed mastermind in the cartoon, why would he want to come out a decade later? Dr. Claw is played by Rupert Everett who I think does a good job although his voice sounds nothing like the original. But he does have his funny moments. Dr. Claw's henchmen are funny too, and they help add to the goofiness in the screenplay.One thing I'm curious is to why director David Kellogg decided to have a love interest in this film. In the cartoon, Inspector Gadget had no time for a woman. Why does he need one now? Is it because it's a Disney movie and all Disney movies have to have romance in them? Love is not always needed to make a film successful. There were points in the movie that felt so cheesy when Inspector Gadget was talking to Brenda (played Joely Fisher). To me, that was one of the lower points in the film. I felt that it was unnecessary. The film already had enough female power in it, which was Penny, Gadget's niece.As for the effects, it is fun to watch all the utilities that Broderick tries to call upon. I don't even know what half of them would be used for and how they pertain to being a detective but that's what makes the movie fun to watch. For example when Gadget is at a ball and decides to listen on Brenda and Dr. Claw's conversation he places his ear on statue and starts walking as the cord stretches. And no one notices? How much more ridiculous could that get? Well it does but at least the public does not surround him too often. Another cool effect is the Gadgetmobile. Voiced by D.L. Hughley, the Gadgetmobile has a good number of wisecracks that'll keep the viewer laughing. This was one of the stronger points of the film. It was fun to see Broderick converse with the car. That car probably had the same amount of gizmos as did Inspector Gadget. As for everything else, the music was alright, there was nothing really special about it and the sound effects helped the film sound like it still was a cartoon (in a sense). For the most part I was satisfied with the end result. I didn't think it was a total waste, but there were some things that could've been left out and added in to make it better.The live action version of Inspector Gadget has eye-popping special effects and is quite goofy; perhaps too goofy. Though overall, it works as a kiddy film, nothing will bring it up to par with its origin of roots.

Killing innocent humans is one thing -- but squashing little animals?) Alex winds up in prison and is subject to the Ludovico treatment, which is a form of conditioning. He's released when he's cured of his violent impulses and fantasies. The problem is that wherever he turns he seems to run into former victims. He's driven to a suicide attempt that finally cures him of his cure.The question posed is whether humans are nothing more than mechanisms whose works are determined by circumstances, or whether they are blessed (or cursed) with free will, as most religions like to believe.Burgess comes down on the side of choice rather than determinism. It's an easy position to take. We're all aware of our own indecisions and anxiety, which we feel as a matter of choice. It's much more difficult to treat consciousness as an epiphenomenon -- a kind of side effect of our underground neural circuits hard at work -- which is what behavioral psychologists believe.

The action movie of the 80's is without a doubt 'Die Hard'.

So what comes to mind when thinking of action films that defines and changes the genre for better in the 90's? 'Speed'. F**k it, I just came to think about 'T2 - Judgment Day'...So anyhow, 'Speed' didn't define action for the 90's. 'The Matrix' and 'T2' did a better job. But if 'Speed' would've been done wrong, the end result would've been terrible ('Speed 2, anyone?). Done well, action films can be a lot of fun (and thus forgiving some serious goofs and illogical happenings).Jan de Bont directed 'Speed' as his first feature film. He had worked on several action films prior to 'Speed' as a cinematographer (Die Hard', 'Hunt for the Red October'...). What I've read from various film magazines and interweb sites, 'Speed' had some issues when going to production. First of all, I have to mention Joss Whedon's ('Firefly' and 'Serenity') name as he contributed on the script making it work better. He was left uncredited, though. But what worried me the most was that Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock weren't among the first choices for starring roles. Stephen Baldwin, William Baldwin, Arnold Schwarzenegger... Get to da choppa! just sounds better than Stop da buzz!.Glenn Close, Meryl Streep, Anjelica Huston, Emma Thompson, Diane Lane? Great actresses without a doubt but was their first intention to make the film about a group of middle aged tourists on a 20 mph bus touring Beverly Hills?

The acting is so terrible at times that you have to be set for the right mood for it to work. You can't see 'Speed' and wait for some groundbreaking method acting.

Hopper is perfect for his role as the villain (just like in 'Super Mario Bros'... yeah right.) and in my opinion he is the scene stealer.So what's the film really about then? Small pensions and cheap gold watches make retired cops go berserk and make bombs on elevators and buses while forgetting everything about police tactics and getting their faces turn purple of paint.

Once the bus goes 50 miles an hour, the bomb is armed. If it drops below 50, it blows up. What do you do? What do you do!? The action movie of the 80's is without a doubt 'Die Hard'. The movie that defines action in the first decade of the millennium change is in my opinion 'The Matrix' (I know it's made in '99 but you do understand I have to get 'Speed' here in my introduction and besides I first saw 'The Matrix' in 2000...). So what comes to mind when thinking of action films that defines and changes the genre for better in the 90's? 'Speed'. F**k it, I just came to think about 'T2 - Judgment Day'...So anyhow, 'Speed' didn't define action for the 90's. 'The Matrix' and 'T2' did a better job. But if 'Speed' would've been done wrong, the end result would've been terrible ('Speed 2, anyone?). Done well, action films can be a lot of fun (and thus forgiving some serious goofs and illogical happenings).Jan de Bont directed 'Speed' as his first feature film. He had worked on several action films prior to 'Speed' as a cinematographer (Die Hard', 'Hunt for the Red October'...). What I've read from various film magazines and interweb sites, 'Speed' had some issues when going to production. First of all, I have to mention Joss Whedon's ('Firefly' and 'Serenity') name as he contributed on the script making it work better. He was left uncredited, though. But what worried me the most was that Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock weren't among the first choices for starring roles. Stephen Baldwin, William Baldwin, Arnold Schwarzenegger... Get to da choppa! just sounds better than Stop da buzz!.Glenn Close, Meryl Streep, Anjelica Huston, Emma Thompson, Diane Lane? Great actresses without a doubt but was their first intention to make the film about a group of middle aged tourists on a 20 mph bus touring Beverly Hills? OK, that sounded very stupid and I apologize for my lame effort to be funny.Films like 'Speed' are intended to charm the younger audience. I can't think of a better on-screen couple than Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock. Both good looking and terrible actors (yeah, like she deserved the Oscar!). The acting is so terrible at times that you have to be set for the right mood for it to work. You can't see 'Speed' and wait for some groundbreaking method acting. This is supposed to be cheesy and fun. It's not like Jeff Daniels or Dennis Hopper would be doing a better job but I just can't think of any other for their roles. Hopper is perfect for his role as the villain (just like in 'Super Mario Bros'... yeah right.) and in my opinion he is the scene stealer.So what's the film really about then?

One of the many reasons it remains resonant is the manner in which the film addresses class systems - the wealthy versus the poor is a hot topic today and the film shows us why - and the extraordinary cinematic recreation of the sinking of that mighty ship.But for many the manner in which Cameron sets the tone of the story, the reminiscence of the elderly Rose unraveling the tale to her granddaughter and crew of ship Keldysh attempting to raise the Titanic now 84 years on the bottom of the ocean and carrying that theme through the course of the film, seems more cogent today than even at movie's release. Gloria Stewart is radiant as the old Rose and her rapt audience includes Bill Paxton, Suzy Amis, Lewis Abernathy, Nicholas Cascone, and Anatoly M. Sagalevitch. From there the opulence of the 'unsinkable' Titanic unfolds and the gradual love affair between Rose Bukater (Kate Winslet) and poor artist Jack Dawson (Leonardo Di Caprio), a relationship at risk from the brewings of Rose's mother (Frances Farmer) and Rose's intended (Billly Zane). The cruise lasted from April 10, 1912 to April 15, 1912, but it was a lifetime of commitment between the young lovers.In retrospect the performances by some fine actors who would continue to rise is of note Ioan Gruffudd, Victor Garber, David Warner, Danny Nucci etc. The film could have used some editing to reduce the length, and the presence of the unsinkable Molly Brown (Kathy Bates in a wasted role) though historically accurate ads very little to the film and even distracts a bit. Still TITANIC is just that - titanic - and no matter how many times we see it, it never fails to impress.

It's actually nothing more than a retread of the first film, complete with final fight sequence after a number of car stunts, but it manages to stay entertaining thanks to a general policy of more is more.Burt Reynolds is back as J.J.McClure, accompanied by Dom DeLuise (playing Victor Prinzim again), and taking part in another race across America that should prove particularly lucrative for the winner. This time around, the prize money is being awarded by The Sheik (Jamie Farr), who is just using the whole thing as an opportunity to make a name for himself by winning the thing. There are others, however, more interested in making money from The Sheik by kidnapping him instead of winning the race.Hal Needham, who co-wrote the fast and loose script with a couple of other guys, returns to direct the fun and it may be nothing more than one hit-or-miss stunt gag after another but it's all just as enjoyable as it all was in the first movie.As well as Reynolds and DeLuise, we get the return of Sammy Davis Jr. and Dean Martin, Jamie Farr (already mentioned) gets a bigger role, Jackie Chan is back (partnered up with the gigantic Richard Kiel this time), the wild-eyed doctor played by Jack Elam is back and the two Lamborghini babes return, even if they are now played by different actresses. There are also a couple of fun roles for Shirley MacLaine and Marilu Henner while the rest of the cast includes small roles for people like Ricardo Montalban, Telly Savalas, Frank Sinatra, Sid Caesar, Don Knotts, Alex Rocco, Henry Silva, Abe Vigoda and many more.If you enjoyed The Cannonball Run then you may end up enjoying this movie just as much. Some people dismiss it as a pale rerun of the first film with additional material that detracts from the car action but I was kept moderately entertained throughout. Much as I was with the first film.
