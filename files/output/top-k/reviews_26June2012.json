Night Shyamalan has become the butt of every person's movie joke with his consistently preposterous films, his unusual casting, and his own name. Like every director, I believe he can make a well made, approachable film, but Signs is one of the biggest patient-testing thrillers I've come to know. It's an overwrought, frivolous exercise and a belligerent kick to the science fiction genre and those who aspire to work in the field.Shyamalan has effortlessly created one of the most unpleasant and meretricious films this side of the Earth. It begins when Graham Hess (Mel Gibson), a former priest, awakens to hear his daughter, Bo (Abigail Breslin) screaming outside in his cornfield. Graham and his brother, currently living with them, Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix) race outside to find Graham's son Morgan (Rory Culkin) and daughter staring blankly into a crushed area of corn, laying flat in a perfectly round circle. Their suspicion grows as rumors of extraterrestrial lifeforms have inhabited our planet and are looking to take over civilization as we know it.Graham and Merrill have been manning down the fort at home since Graham's wife was killed after being pinned to a tree by a man who had fallen asleep at the window. There is a scene where Graham and the man (played by Shyamalan himself) have an awkward discussion by the side of the road. It is an incredibly insensitive, strangely written scene, with the Shyamalan character reciting some of the worst written dialog in a scene supposed to occupy emotional importance. But that is only one of countless details the film neglects to build on or explain.The film tries to erect credible, memorable suspense by giving us close to an hour of buildup. I normally commend a film when this happens because I believe it provides the writer's talent to come forth, is one of the biggest and strongest building blocks to a great thriller, and is too often traded for things of a lesser breed. Here, the dialog is painfully slow, which leads to scenes progressing at a staggeringly incompetent pace, and every line of dialog is recited in a hushed, melodramatic sort of whisper that it becomes dreary and impotent abnormally fast.When we are finally met with the unworldly lifeforms (and trust me, they're not too exciting and their presence is kept at a minimum) we are greeted with one of the most colossal curveballs (not in a good way) and insulting miscalculations I have yet to see in a thriller. The aliens are said to have traveled light years through space and time, built ships of strong stature (which can be assumed since they can perfectly smash a healthy section of corn), and have successfully created a plan, they hope, will allow them to take over our planet. And they're allergic to water. I hate to build on this complaint, seeing as so many other people this side of the IMDb\/Rotten Tomatoes forums have voiced criticisms have done so, but it truly not only strikes me as odd but incredibly unbelievable - even for a sci-fi film, where the suspension of disbelief is almost required for every film in the genre.How are the aliens supposed to survive on a planet that is two-thirds water? Where every breath you take has some moisture in it? It is also stated from Mel Gibson in one of the most laughably unbelievable lines in many a moon that the aliens seem to have trouble with pantry doors. Yes. They are allergic to water and can't bypass an ordinary wooden door. Which leads me to another question; if the aliens plan to take over the Earth, you'd assume they'd need weapons, right? You can't go around the planet inconveniently landing in people's cornrows and crushing a good crop? If the aliens, presumably, have weapons on board that they could destroy the Earth with, don't you think the same weapons could be used to assist in bypassing a wooden door? It baffles me the negligence towards logic this movie partook in. Signs is a maddening affront to thriller and science-fiction films that try to create characters, atmosphere, and an original storyline, that are left to wallow in exhaust from the unexpected take off of other films of the same genre. I will say the film provides us with good cinematography, but completely disregards it so we can see more of the film's attempts at needless style and inconsistencies more noticeable than a perfect circle in your crops. I've always thought it would be virtually impossible to round up four or more capable performers in a picture and find almost nothing interesting to do with them, or even make an attempt to note their presence, but Signs has definitely proved me wrong.Starring Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, Rory Culkin, and Abigail Breslin.

Where every breath you take has some moisture in it? It is also stated from Mel Gibson in one of the most laughably unbelievable lines in many a moon that the aliens seem to have trouble with pantry doors. Yes. They are allergic to water and can't bypass an ordinary wooden door. Which leads me to another question; if the aliens plan to take over the Earth, you'd assume they'd need weapons, right? You can't go around the planet inconveniently landing in people's cornrows and crushing a good crop? If the aliens, presumably, have weapons on board that they could destroy the Earth with, don't you think the same weapons could be used to assist in bypassing a wooden door?

Night Shyamalan has become the butt of every person's movie joke with his consistently preposterous films, his unusual casting, and his own name. Like every director, I believe he can make a well made, approachable film, but Signs is one of the biggest patient-testing thrillers I've come to know. It's an overwrought, frivolous exercise and a belligerent kick to the science fiction genre and those who aspire to work in the field.Shyamalan has effortlessly created one of the most unpleasant and meretricious films this side of the Earth. It begins when Graham Hess (Mel Gibson), a former priest, awakens to hear his daughter, Bo (Abigail Breslin) screaming outside in his cornfield. Graham and his brother, currently living with them, Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix) race outside to find Graham's son Morgan (Rory Culkin) and daughter staring blankly into a crushed area of corn, laying flat in a perfectly round circle. Their suspicion grows as rumors of extraterrestrial lifeforms have inhabited our planet and are looking to take over civilization as we know it.Graham and Merrill have been manning down the fort at home since Graham's wife was killed after being pinned to a tree by a man who had fallen asleep at the window.

That way they have more incentive to make the film watchable and more freedom to add their personal touches. Blood Simple works on many levels, and it would have been easy to see that these two were bound for great things once this film was completed.The story deals with a seemingly prosperous nightclub owner who hires a scummy private eye to prove is wife is having an affair with one of his bartenders. Dan Hedaya, who has done it all in terms of character acting, paints this businessman as a jealous and brooding type. But also a man who will openly hit on women who come into his club. Not being able to stomach his wife's affair, he hires the same detective to murder them for a fee of ten thousand dollars. That hardly seems like a big enough fee to entice a man to kill two people. Especially when a crime like this would seem very easy to solve. But this detective, played with dripping scumminess by M. Emmet Walsh, agrees. Somewhere along the line, he decides that it would probably be easier to commit just one murder.

First of all, I'd like to say that I absolutely love 'Alien', it's a brilliant, tense and exciting film. Easily a solid 5 star for me. And after watching the constantly praised follow up, I've came to the conclusion that 'Aliens' is the equivalent to 'Terminator 2' to 'The Terminator'. The only difference is, that T2 was actually a good film. I feel like I've wasted a good 2 hours of my life, and I have no doubt in my mind that 'Aliens' is one of the most overrated movies in existence.The first thing that threw me off, and it is a very minor thing, so I'm not going into too much detail, is that we first find out that Ripley has awoken nearly 60 years after the events of Alien. This is fine, but my problem is, why announce this important piece of information in a dream? To my knowledge this was the first time we were told about the time jump, so wouldn't it be more PRUDENT to mention it in the 'real world' just to stop confusing people whether or not this happened or not.Anyway, yes, the first 35 minutes of this are surprisingly good. I really enjoyed the hearing sequence, and I find it possibly the strongest scene in the entire movie. Once we get to the base though, I think this is where the film starts to go dramatically down hill, and this is why. I just don't care. I sat for 2 hours in that film, not caring about what was happening, not because I didn't want to, it was because it was unegaging and boring. First of all we're introduced to a group of Squad members, who are probably the most annoying group of people I've ever seen on screen. I'm not even going to waste my time talking about Blake, Husdon and Vasques. The first two really could've been the same character and the third spends the entire movie standing around dramatically looking like a really muscular Halle Berry.Bar Ripley, Cameron has given us virtually no emotional connection to any of these characters. There were moments where soldiers were dying every 5 minutes and I just didn't care, and the fact that I didn't care completely took me out of the film, and made every bit of character motivation for me annoying, because I just couldn't feel it. No matter how urgent or how dangerous the characters tell me this entire situation is, it just doesn't feel threatening, and this is probably the worst thing about the film. The best thing about 'Alien' is that you did feel emotionally involved, it had genuine suspense and atmosphere, with 'Aliens' the entire thing has just been lost, there's virtually nothing in there at all to set this apart from other horror\/action movies. The only startling imagery in the entire thing, was the scene involving the dead bodies cacooned in the cieling, and the woman turning out to be alive. This was quickly ruined however, by the obvious 'chest bursting scene', which I knew was coming and was waiting for it. The problems with most sequels is that half of the time they want to try something very new and inventive, and the other half of the time, they just repeat themselves. I had no doubt in my mind that a chest bursting scene would happen. Saying that though, I did enjoy the scene at the start, but I knew since when that happened Cameron was pretty much like Ah nahh, I'm just kidding, wait for later!, so I spent the entire movie up to then, just expecting it, which I wouldn't of done if I actually was emotionally involved in the movie, which I wasn't, because this is pretty much something else that Cameron has ruined with his generic direction.To me 'Aliens' pretty much consisted of one absurd action scene after another. I felt totally uninvolved, and the entire movie just had no heart at all. There's no sense of terror, no sense of claustrophobia, which I have to add the first film did incredibly well. It's just&#x85; nonsense, with no emotional centre. I really did enjoy Sigourney Weavers performance though, even though I found it a little wooden in places. Other than that, I think she did a good job, and I was thankfull they kept her as the prominent main character and at the front of all the action. Other than that, very disappointing.

When his forces kidnap a bunch of hostages and issues a Doctor Evil-style ransom demand, the Allied Nations respond by sending in Colonel Guile (Jean-Claude Van Damme) to bring the madman to justice. But Guile isn't the only one on Bison's trail - journalist Chun-Li Zang (Ming Na) has personal reasons for pursuing the general while drifters Ryu (Byron Mann) and Ken (Damian Chappa) run into local gun-runner Sagat (Wes Studi) and find themselves involved in the conflict as well.Street Fighter is yet another addition in the bulging 'dodgy video-game movies' sub-genre, offering little more than token gestures to the source material and instead focusing on being a generic action flick with a tongue-in-cheek feel.

But what are we to make of an announcement at Bison's base that reminds troopers to take out health insurance as Van Damme shoots everyone in sight? It's like filming a Resident Evil movie but making it like Shaun Of The Dead! Acting is almost universally wooden with the exception of Julia, who hams it up as the pantomime baddie, but I got the sense that he was simply paying the bills. It's a shame that this is his epitaph as Julia was a much better actor than this tosh deserved.There are other issues as well - the characters only really look like their game counterparts during the final battle sequence (where they all use guns!), the English character Cammy is played by Australian singer Kylie Minogue with no attempt made at an English accent and character back stories from the game are pretty much ignored - I don't recall Zangief (Andrew Bryniarski) working for Bison or Balrog (Grand L. Bush) being a good guy and the less said of Dhalsim (Roshan Seth), the better - his appearance in this movie has no relation to the game at all. Actually, the worse character by far is Blanka (Robert Mammone) who not only looks ridiculous but has very little to do besides growl and snarl - not even a decent fight scene. There is a goofy appeal to this film, a sense of stupidity than is oddly infectious and in spite of yourself, you kinda enjoy it despite the numerous faults.

The main thread follows that of Mike (Favreau) who had to break off a six year relationship in New York in order to move west and pursue his dream. Six months later and he is still distraught over the break up and his friend Trent decides to teach him how to get back in the game and become 'money' (irresistible to women) as he likes to put it. In doing this they travel to Las Vegas, back street Hollywood bars and parties up mountains where Mike manages to meet women and ultimately destroy any chance of a relationship in less than an hour. The film is very relatable for most men out there who lack the confidence when talking to women compared to Trent (Vaughn's) abundance of it.The film is written by Favreau himself and I have to say the script is fantastic. The dialogue really works for the film, and the performances and delivery of the lines by the actors really help the script look great. The story is paper thin and not much to it, but the dialogue within it is brilliant and very funny. One of the scenes involving Mike ringing a girl he met in the bar that night and leaving several messages as the machine keeps cutting him off is brilliant and had me laughing in hysterics. Many of the lines done this and it was a breath of fresh air for some of the comedies released now days. Writer's need to look back at this comedy to see how it should really be done.The performances in the film are good and are perfect for the tone of this movie. The dialogue must have been hard to learn as there are many occasions when people ramble on in a rant, which is all filmed in one shot. These moments fit the film really well, especially with many tracking shots that cut off peoples head and it is as if you are actually walking behind the actors. The camera work and cinematography isn't great but it works with the film so you can get over it. This is what is great about this film is that it looks low budget and very studenty but that is what makes it such a treat. I wasn't expecting much and found myself pleasantly surprised.When you watch this film, and I say when because you so should, you will be surprised to see a really young Vince Vaughn, and if you know him Jon Favreau, with them both looking the part as normal everyday guys. I think this is one of Vaughn's first films, before he really hit stardom, and it is plain to see why he was pulled into bigger roles as he is very funny here. Favreau, by all accounts, wrote this script based on his own experience of moving to Hollywood in search of stardom, and his friends who helped him through this time. Those friends were in fact Vince Vaughn and Ron Livingstone who portray themselves with different names in this film. This was how they all were and it is easy to believe that this could be the case, with the performances, camera work, script, and cinematography really keeping the film grounded. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by this film. It isn't the best comedy I have seen but it is one of the better ones. I think it is due to it being so relatable and different to over blown comedies out there. The film has a lot of heart and you route for the characters throughout. We are even treated to a late cameo from Heather Graham, who despite her being a little more famous than the other actors at the time, doesn't seem out of place at all, and if anything adds something special to it. There is also a fantastic final scene which had me in stitches and wrapped up the change in characters completely.

Annoyed and at the same time impressed by the handsome stranger Melanie find out where he lives and plans to buy him the birds herself as a present and at the same time give him a piece of her mind in the bargain. That's when the light comedy ends and the sheer horror begins in the movie.Traveling all the way up to Badoga Bay, to present him the love birds, where Mitch is spending the weekend with his mom Lydia, Jessica Tandy,and sister Cathy things start to happen in the little fishing town that there's no logical explanation for. The birds in the area, finches blackbirds ravens and seagulls, start to go on a rampage against the people living there! At first it's just one bird at a time being aggressive but as the days ware on they mass in the hundreds and thousands and attack anything in sight. Melinia getting a room from local teacher Annie Hayworth, Suzanne Pleshette, finds out that not only is she Cathy's teacher but had an affair with Mitch. There's also a side story in the film in that Annie's affair was broken up by Mitch's widowed mom Lydia in fearing that she's take him away from her and that also effects Mitch relations with Melanie as well. That all soon disappears when the birds come on the scene,by the tens of thousands,and start both terrorizing as well as killing the citizens in Badoga Bay!One of Alfred Hitchcock's biggest hits,it grossed well over 11 million dollars in the box office, with things in it that he's not really known for The eye popping special effects scenes of the birds on the attack in the air as well as on the ground in the movie. There's that famous scene with Melanie sitting near a monkey bar outside the school where at first one black bird lands on it and then within minutes it swamped with hundreds more as an unsuspecting Melanie with her back turned is just enjoying the view! Not for once realizing that she's, and those in the school, are about to be viciously attacked by them! There's later in the movie the scene when Malanie is trapped in the attic of the Brenner house and attacked and almost pecked to death by hundreds of attacking birds that's even more terrifying and bloody, being shot in color, then the famous shower scene in Psycho. In fact actress Tippi Hedren was so traumatized by it that she actually suffered a nervous breakdown and was sidelined for a week after living or acting through it!***SPOILERS*** With all the great scenes in the film it's the final one that really stuck with me. That's when the birds by now in the hundreds of thousands overrunning Bodaga Bay and now completely in control allow the few remaining residents to leave unharmed in a show, if you can call it that, of compassion. In what seems like the birds knowing that after what happened to them that they'll never come back there again and go tell those living outside of Bagoda Bay what to expect if they ever did!

That's when Mitch spots her at a local San Francisco pet store where he's looking to buy a pair of love birds for his 11 year old sister Cathy's, Veronica Cartwright, birthday. Annoyed and at the same time impressed by the handsome stranger Melanie find out where he lives and plans to buy him the birds herself as a present and at the same time give him a piece of her mind in the bargain.

Everything about it is memorable, from its set pieces to its shocks to its cast to its music to a young Steven Spielberg's masterful direction, and these elements can thrill even the viewer who's seen them before. Any summer season simply wouldn't be complete without a viewing of it. The story is straightforward and compelling; the screenplay (final credit is given to author Peter Benchley and screenwriter \/ actor Carl Gottlieb, who plays newspaperman Meadows) trims the melodramatic fat from the Benchley novel and goes right for the thrills, which come frequently.Although the story hardly needs a summary here, it basically deals with a resort island community, named Amity, that finds its livelihood - and its citizens & visitors - threatened by a rogue great white shark, which just refuses to go away and insists on staying where the eating is good. Eventually, an expedition is launched to find and destroy the beast.Roy Scheider is perfect as the everyman hero, police chief Martin Brody, who tries to do the right thing and protect the people even when local authorities, mainly represented by stupidly stubborn mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) stress to him the importance of a financially successful summer season. Richard Dreyfuss is fun as the rich kid shark expert who tries to educate Vaughn and others on the facts of the great white. And Robert Shaw, in a scenery chewing performance, is brilliant as salty fisherman Quint, who has a generous array of the most quotable lines, including a speech regarding the men of the USS Indianapolis. Fine support is provided by Hamilton, Lorraine Gary as the loving and supportive wife, and Jeffrey Kramer as the deputy.On location shooting in Martha's Vineyard supplies plenty of wonderful flavour, and who can ever forget THAT music by John Williams, the composer \/ conductor who's given us some of the best instantly recognizable movie themes of all time? The stories of the making of the movie are now the stuff of legend, with the inability to get mechanical shark Bruce to function properly the ultimate happy accident, forcing the filmmakers to use subjective camera work and a very simple cue from Williams to indicate the sharks' presence. Among the iconic sequences are those of the first victim (Susan Backlinie) meeting her doom, the misguided attempt by two fishermen to catch the shark, Brody and Hooper's night time search for the fish and an unpleasant surprise that drops into frame, the entire second half which is seagoing adventure at its finest, and the aforementioned USS Indianapolis speech.An enduring part of the popular culture if ever there was one, Jaws is one of those movie milestones that any fan of the cinema ought to see at least once. It was extremely influential in its time, spawning a bunch of similar nature strikes back thrillers, and to this day it would be hard to not swim in the ocean or just *think* of the ocean and not have Jaws on the brain.10 out of 10.

On the human level, this picture is able to tell more about the matter of personal relationships than any of the popular and sweet comedies ever will.This is seriously Antonioni's first picture about a man. This man, named Thomas (David Hemmings), is a swinging, stylish, emotionless magazine photographer based in London. His interchanging personality allows him to adapt to every situation, in which he has to take pictures &#x96; be it a random set of photos in a dusty flophouse, or a real fashion shoot in his luxurious studio. He treats women like objects, never giving them enough attention, and changes his partners like the proverbial underwear. He is so devoted to his job and to his camera that he isn't able to realize how detached he is from the society and how odd most of his actions might look like to an outsider. On one seemingly uneventful day he goes on a stroll in the nearby desolate park, where he finds a man and a woman walking around the trees. He decides to take a few quick snaps, and before he is able to leave the place the woman (Vanessa Redgrave), who seems frightened and suspiciously intent on getting these pictures right away, confronts him. Yet, he takes the camera to his apartment and starts to examine one photo after another. What he finds may put him in grave danger, as he begins to unravel a deadly mystery behind the events that took place on that day. The hints are in the details, and because of his perfect photographic abilities he is capable of uncovering every single clue that is hidden in the blowups. This is a visually rich picture, built with glowing and colorful images, and focused mostly on the fashion sphere and the mod world, in which the main character lives. In all of this, there is also the sudden twist, the element of suspense that reminds somehow of a Hitchcockian picture, Rear Window. The protagonist finds out about a murder case that nobody was meant to uncover. He puts himself in a tough position, as he doesn't know who was killed or why, and every action might have some serious consequences. David Hemmings is very convincing, as this selfish, arrogant, cool, and nonchalant photographer, who is on the path to unravel a dark secret behind a few seemingly ordinary pictures. Vanessa Redgrave gives a very good performance as this overly anxious, yet seductive and beautiful mysterious woman. Even though it might seem too long or hard to grasp for some people I still recommend it, as it is not only a fantastic take on London's fashion circle in the 60's, but also a disturbing and complex story about the dehumanizing power of photography.

Complicating Superman's job, however, is an emotional and psychological dilemma facing his man persona, something I call a Spiderman Existential Moment.Every so often in the Spiderman comics (and in the recent movies), Peter Parker has agonizing debates about whether he should continue as Spiderman, because playing hero denies him a normal life and constantly puts his friends and loved ones in danger. Apparently but unexpectedly, Superman as soft-spoken bumbler Clark Kent feels the same doubt about his superhero life. Superman II scores points for devoting equal time to Clark Kent, but in my opinion does not fully prepare us for his renunciation of his powers for love. Nothing leads us to suspect that he is dissatisfied or burdened by his superhero responsibilities, or by having to support a secret identity. We are asked to take it for granted. We are also asked to accept the fact that Superman\/Clark Kent has harbored such secret, burning desire to be with Lois Lane for a long time. OK, OK, he did reverse time in the first Superman to resurrect her from the dead. But, and I know I might get attacked for saying this, why would anyone give up his superpowers to be with Lois Lane? I guess I was never a Lois Lane fan. Superficially, Lois is presented as an intrepid, daring, celebrated newspaper reporter. However, she's always making reckless, foolhardy mistakes that put her in danger from which only Superman can save her. Lois can also be breezingly thoughtless and cruel to fellow employees like Jimmy Olsen - and the unassuming Clark especially. And as others have said from time immemorial, if she is such a perceptive reporter, why did it take her so long to notice that Superman and Clark are one and the same? I guess Superman\/Clark has a special kind of emotional, as well as physical, X-ray vision that sees something in Lois we mere mortals just can't.Well anyway, as the Kryptonian trio ravage the Earth, Superman whisks Lois off to his Fortress of Solitude, uses the crystal shards to de-power himself, and has an un-PC sexual dalliance with Ms. Lane at his Arctic home. Soon, they somehow leave the Fortress (it must have taken days without his powers) without freezing to death, find a station wagon and drive back to Metropolis. During a pit stop at a diner, a humiliating brawl with a bully makes Clark have second thoughts about his sacrifice. Clark has another Spiderman moment when he finally learns that the Kryptonian trio may soon take over, and that with great power comes great responsibilities. Better get those powers back. But wait, Jor-El and Lara had warned him that the superpower loss was irrevocable. Except when it isn't. The green crystal is the key. Clark has to trudge back thousands of freezing miles with the crystal back to the Fortress to get his mojo back. Just in time too, because the Kryptonian trio has invaded Metropolis.You know the rest the Kryptonians have a destructive battle, the villains capture Lois, Superman retreats to his Fortress to lure the villains away and spare Metropolis more devastation, Superman tricks the villains into losing their powers, the villains fall into an icy crevasse (awaiting a sequel that never came), Superman saves Lois and gives her the forgetfulness kiss, Superman promises the President of the United States that he will never desert his post again, the end.Now, now, I liked the movie very much, in spite of some inconsistencies and improbabilities (due to the checkered development history reported by other posters), because of both the dynamic action and character development, plus the interspersions of humor, drama, and even horror.

Clark has another Spiderman moment when he finally learns that the Kryptonian trio may soon take over, and that with great power comes great responsibilities. Better get those powers back. But wait, Jor-El and Lara had warned him that the superpower loss was irrevocable. Except when it isn't. The green crystal is the key. Clark has to trudge back thousands of freezing miles with the crystal back to the Fortress to get his mojo back. Just in time too, because the Kryptonian trio has invaded Metropolis.You know the rest the Kryptonians have a destructive battle, the villains capture Lois, Superman retreats to his Fortress to lure the villains away and spare Metropolis more devastation, Superman tricks the villains into losing their powers, the villains fall into an icy crevasse (awaiting a sequel that never came), Superman saves Lois and gives her the forgetfulness kiss, Superman promises the President of the United States that he will never desert his post again, the end.Now, now, I liked the movie very much, in spite of some inconsistencies and improbabilities (due to the checkered development history reported by other posters), because of both the dynamic action and character development, plus the interspersions of humor, drama, and even horror. But Superman II is special because it humanizes the demigod from another world and, even though it may surprise and annoy us, he is as capable of making hasty, impulsive, romantic choices as any of us. Fortunately for the world, Superman\/Clark Kent learns from his mistakes.Wait, I forgot. Newly re-powered Clark revisits the diner and meets the bully again. Clark shoves the bully against a pinball machine and pays for the damage. Sweet payback. NOW it's the end.

My doubts towards the usually mediocre Dreamworks had faded; but only for a little bit. The quality dropped just a wee bit after the first 10 minutes, but I was still enjoying myself. The film holds up for another 20 minutes, and then it's rarely amusing again. The main character, Z, is tired of having decisions made for him. He doesn't want to be a worker, and he's sick of being forced to things he doesn't want to do. Through a crazy chain of events, Z becomes a war hero, is accused for kidnapping Princess Bala, and ultimately, begins his journey to Insectopia, where he can make his own decisions, and live in paradise. After the first 30 minutes, Antz decides to movie the story in a completely different direction and what could've been an entertaining film turned into another mediocre Dreamworks entry. Part of the reason Antz was such a disappointment were the characters. They're simply unlikeable. At the minimum Dreamworks managed to at least develop personalities for the characters (though there are several exceptions) but none of them are very likable. Bala is a brat, Z is a bumbling idiot, and General Mandible; the film's villain, is often confusing. Mandible has no motive for his villainy, and is ultimately forgettable for his lack of personality or originality. Antz is the second CGI movie ever made, so I might have forgiven Dreamworks for the ugly animation. However, the first CGI film (Toy Story) had considerably better looking animation, so Antz really has no excuse. The character designs are atrocious. You can't tell the difference between a female ant or a male ant until they talk! The design of the ants face and head look like a bad version of E.T. right down to the skin tone. It's just downright awful. And the voice acting is also rather disappointing. The voices lack energy and a vast majority of the lines sound flat. With so many big names, I had expected more. Perhaps that's why I was so disappointed. The score however (composed by Harry Gregson-Williams and John Powell) was incredible (especially during the beginning where there are a lot of jazzy songs). The music is perhaps the only thing that tops it's competitor film, A Bug's Life. However, there's an incredibly silly lyrical song that's played during the credits that has nothing to do with the movie and it's just awful. I don't know what Dreamworks was thinking by adding this song into the credits. The thing that surprised me the most about Antz, though, was how non- family friendly the film was. Some scenes take place in an ant bar, some language that shouldn't be allowed in a children's film, and a LOT of violence. I scarcely ever see films with such a high body count. Hundreds if not thousands of ants are killed during a war, one of which was decapitated. One bug ends up falling to his doom and we see the impact. For a teens on up film, this may not be a big deal, but for a movie for kids, this is unacceptable. While Antz does have some brief moments of inspiration, it ends up being another mediocre film from Dreamworks. With bad animation, bad story, bad voice acting, and a lot of slow parts, Antz is a relatively pointless affair. Antz has some redeeming qualities, but ultimately, the best thing about Antz, is that it reminds us how good A Bug's Life is.

This timeless story boasts everything exotic locales, a scrappy hero, flamboyant characters, opulent royalty, giddy romance, despicable and devious villains, and, most tellingly, the endless possibilities of magic as epitomized by the genie. However, as Disney's animators crafted this dynamic spectacle of a movie, I think they must have been concerned that one of Aladdin's greatest assets -the protean, boundlessly energetic, and fast-talking Genie, as voiced by the inimitable comic pantomiming maelstrom Robin Williams- might ironically turn out to be one of its greatest liabilities. In the Genie, we have a dominating, omnipotent character who can seemingly do anything. So, once Aladdin gets possession of the Genie's lamp, isn't the movie over? Just three wishes, and it's happily ever after.Besides, doesn't Aladdin succeed solely because of the Genie? You may recall that Aladdin (voice of Scott Weinger) promises to free the unbridled genie with his third wish. However, after the Genie makes him a fabulously wealthy prince on the verge of wooing the Sultan's (Douglas Seale) alluring daughter Princess Jasmine (Linda Larkin) toward matrimony, Aladdin wants to renege on the deal because he feels he cannot continue this ultimate charade without the Genie's continued help. Understandably, this puts the Genie in a funk and leads to a series of plot twists that place the Genie under the control of the ruthlessly ambitious Sultan's vizier (consultant) Jafar (Jonathan Freeman). It seems that Aladdin goes from hero back to hopeless zero.But hold on thearrrr, as Quick Draw McGraw would say, Disney shows us that Aladdin is not such a hopeless nothing. From the beginning of the film, where we see the penniless orphan and his pilfering simian accomplice Abu (Frank Welker) acrobatically elude the Sultan's security guards led by the burly, irascible Razoul (Jim Cummings), we notice that Aladdin is nimble, clever, street smart, plucky and adaptable. Even after being trapped in the Cave of Wonders by a disguised Jafar (who needs Aladdin to obtain the magic lamp) and finding the lamp, Aladdin tricks the trickster Genie into freeing him without wasting a wish. Furthermore, even the Genie's vast power has its limits. Besides servitude to whoever has the lamp, the Genie informs Aladdin that he has no power over death or love. In other words, he can't be an assassin, or the Messiah, or Cupid. If Aladdin wants to woo Jasmine, he ultimately has to do it on his own. And when Jafar exploits the Genie to become a sultan and sorcerer and uses his power to neutralize his friends, Aladdin again has to find it within himself to defeat Jafar on his own. Instead of false princely status, he uses his courage, sly wit and Jafar's voracious desire for ultimate magic to bring him down.So you see, Aladdin belies its ethereal, insubstantial structure and supernatural fantasy elements to remind us that, after all, even if you have true friends to help you along, the true magic to make your life better lies within you.

The robbery should've lasted ten minutes, but due to poor planning and a couple simple mistakes, the robbery quickly escalated into a hostage negociation that involved the NYPD and FBI. The media quickly picked up the story, and within an hour of the report going out, dozens and dozens of New Yorkers and news vans flooded the area to catch a glimpse at the unfolding crime scene. After 14 hours, the standoff ended, resulting in one fatality and a crazy story that would eventually become one of the 1970s best movies.Al Pacino is Sonny, a young Vietnam veteran who is attempting to rob a bank to pay for his gay lover's sex-change operation. His partner, Sal, and him really don't have much of a plan, and when it all goes wrong, they demand the FBI send a limo and an airplane to get them out of the country. Sonny is not a bad person, per se - he's emotionally unstable and has had an extremely difficult time re-entering civilian life after fighting in the war. Sal is a bit more disengaged altogether, and has no real backstory other than that he has had several run-ins with the law before.The surprising part of this movie is that the audience comes to sympathize (in a strange way) with the robbers as well as the hostages. In real life, the tellers and bank manager reported to news outlets that they actually enjoyed their time with the robbers, saying they were very funny and surprisingly good conversationalists. This comes through in the movie, especially at the end when a teller, being let go as part of an agreement between Sonny and the FBI, gives Sal a cross and tells him not to worry - even if it is his first time on a plane, it'll be all right. I'll pray for you, she says, almost sad to be leaving him behind.The performances are all top-notch. From the rowdy mob in the street to Sonny's gay lover, Leon; from the goofy teller who seems to be enjoying the hostage situation to Pacino and Cazale themselves, everyone does a terrific job of keeping the audience engaged and entertained. With the exception of a song played during the opening sequence, there is no soundtrack, which is shockingly effective and adds to the vivid realism of the movie.If you've never seen this movie, please watch it. It wastes no time, pulls no punches, and has a great ending. I don't care if other viewers hated this or didn't connect with the characters... they're sociopaths. Watch this movie with an open mind and just take from it what you will. You won't be disappointed.

I'll pray for you, she says, almost sad to be leaving him behind.The performances are all top-notch. From the rowdy mob in the street to Sonny's gay lover, Leon; from the goofy teller who seems to be enjoying the hostage situation to Pacino and Cazale themselves, everyone does a terrific job of keeping the audience engaged and entertained. With the exception of a song played during the opening sequence, there is no soundtrack, which is shockingly effective and adds to the vivid realism of the movie.If you've never seen this movie, please watch it. It wastes no time, pulls no punches, and has a great ending. I don't care if other viewers hated this or didn't connect with the characters... they're sociopaths. Watch this movie with an open mind and just take from it what you will. You won't be disappointed.

The robbery should've lasted ten minutes, but due to poor planning and a couple simple mistakes, the robbery quickly escalated into a hostage negociation that involved the NYPD and FBI. The media quickly picked up the story, and within an hour of the report going out, dozens and dozens of New Yorkers and news vans flooded the area to catch a glimpse at the unfolding crime scene. After 14 hours, the standoff ended, resulting in one fatality and a crazy story that would eventually become one of the 1970s best movies.Al Pacino is Sonny, a young Vietnam veteran who is attempting to rob a bank to pay for his gay lover's sex-change operation. His partner, Sal, and him really don't have much of a plan, and when it all goes wrong, they demand the FBI send a limo and an airplane to get them out of the country. Sonny is not a bad person, per se - he's emotionally unstable and has had an extremely difficult time re-entering civilian life after fighting in the war. Sal is a bit more disengaged altogether, and has no real backstory other than that he has had several run-ins with the law before.The surprising part of this movie is that the audience comes to sympathize (in a strange way) with the robbers as well as the hostages.

Elements of Hitchcock and David Lynch could be seen\/felt, but definitely had it's own style. Acting was great, though not in a completely realistic way, more like the other worldly, slightly dreamlike delivery found in a Lynch film, but it didn't get as bizarre or unfathomable as Lynch often does (don't get me wrong, I love David Lynch!). Direction, Cinematography and Editing, again, excellent. So many interesting shots and sequences. A lot has been said about the choice of actor for Clay and the fact that everyone in the film sees the brothers as identical. My interpretation is that they ARE identical twins and that there just happens to be a black actor playing Clay and a white one playing Vincent. If the director decides they are identical twins in the film and that everyone in the film will see them as that, then they are. If a director has a prop of the Grand Canyon made for a film that doesn't look like the Grand Canyon, but he decides it is and has all the characters in the film treat it as the Grand Canyon, then in that film, it is the Grand Canyon. Obviously this was done on purpose to give more weight to the theme of identity. I don't think race had anything to do with the story of the film except in the mind of the viewer, which is valid, as it is such an issue in our society and why i think the director chose a black actor (rather than another white actor) so that the viewer will think even more about identity. I believe the twins were born to Mrs. Lucerne and separated at birth. There is a sequence where she describes this. I think this is when he received the St Christopher. Why Vincent was kept by Mrs Towers we don't know. Why Clay didn't stay with Mrs Lucerne, we don't know. Mrs Towers must have known there was another twin because he was at the funeral. Where did the St Christopher appear from after going missing? Was it put there by Vincent or Mrs Towers?I would have given this 10 stars, but for the ending, which was OK, but could've had a choice of twists. 1. He assumes the identity of Vincent, but then some new evidence comes to light and he ends up being charged with the murder of his father. 2. Even better, the Clay we see at the beginning of the film before the explosion is a facade and he actually killed the father after finding out about the details of his birth. this is why he also shot Mrs Lucerne because she gave him away to a poor life in a poor town. He was then planning to kill Vincent and assume his identity, but Vincent got to him first. I think this is borne out by the fact that, once he realises who he is, he's not as nice a guy as at the beginning of the film. I think he decides to remain as Vincent because that was his plan all along. And then the new evidence comes to light and he ends up being charged with the murder of his father. I think Mrs Lucerne, Mrs Towers and the St Christopher could've been woven into a much better ending, but even so, one of the best films I've seen for a while ","genre":null},{"date":"26 June 2012","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Excellent modern noir, though could've had a better ending as I will explain later.
