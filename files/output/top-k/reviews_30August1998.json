In fact, so much that people would ridicule and bash a film that gained so much popularity.  It is all a matter of jealousy.  If you hear anyone tell you otherwise, they are lying.  The people who bash the film are the same people who thought it would flop.  Because it didn't, they are trying to find new things to complain about it.  It's too long... and all that crap.  Of course, ironically, these are the people who just love Gone With the Wind, which is even longer, running at 4 hours!  Titanic is a great film.  It's a tragic love story... simple, but completely effective.  It's haunting in it's portrayal of Jack and Rose.  The film was supposed to evoke emotions, and a complex story can not do that.  If you watch The English Patient, you don't cry.  You just watch with fascination. Titanic makes you cry.  Simplicity is the key.  We've seen all sorts of films on Titanic, but they all focus on cardboard characters.  By making us care for Jack and Rose, we eventually care for everyone aboard.  Jealousy even takes a part in the film.  This reflexivity is actually rather humorous considering that Cal Hockley was jealous of Jack for getting Rose's love.  Cal Hockley represents all the people that bash Titanic.  Jack represents Titanic.  And Rose is the masses of critics and audiences that do love it.  Did Cameron purposely write a screenplay of this type in order to reflect how people would really feel?  I doubt it, but the similarities are quite striking.  In a period when films are mostly centered around special effects and style, Titanic comes along and heralds back to the old days of making films.  But, when it tries to do this, it gets ridiculed by many.  These people should take heed because if they do this, they are giving themselves bad names... they would rather watch Armageddon than Titanic.  Gone With The Wind is the most obvious comparison here.  When watching it today for the first time, I thought the romance was lame, because it wasn't romantic.  It displayed a moronic lead female who couldn't make up her mind.  Titanic is a postmodernistic tale of love that we should all comprehend.  We would just love to find someone like Jack or Rose.  But alas most of us won't.  Watching it on screen is the closest we will come.  People that bash it are obviously haters of love, and maybe never feel anything at all.  Titanic is a great film.  The best of 1997 and one of the best ever made.  Cameron has done something no one ever expected  he made a successful film based entirely on love.  Now, how ironic is that ?

But the ending more than makes up for it. At two hours and eight minutes it runs way, way too long.  It needs at least half an hour cut out of it.  If fact,  more than an hour and a half could be cut and it could be  run as the most expensive episode ever of THE TWILIGHT  ZONE.But, as I said, it starts well.  Nicholas is an investment banker, played by Michael Douglas with his WALL STREET  characterization and wardrobe intact.  Nicholas makes  money.  Nicholas has money.  Nicholas wants more money.   He lives alone in a huge house in San Francisco,  presumably spending his evenings alone counting his money.Of course, his life is going to change.  That's the film's whole thesis.  Instead of changing in an unusual way,  though, what happens blends elements of SECRET CINEMA (and this year's THE TRUMAN SHOW), THE WIZARD OF OZ, and A  CHRISTMAS CAROL into a meatloaf of a movie made with  leftover ingredients.Nicholas's birthday comes along, and he gets together for  dinner with his brother Conrad (Sean Penn).  Conrad is the loose cannon of the family.  In and out of trouble, in and out of rehab.  He and Nicholas were both traumatized by  their father's suicide many years ago, an event which will be strangely echoed in elements of THE GAME's most  excellent climax.Conrad has a gift for Nicholas a gift certificate for a  once in a lifetime experience.  Nicholas submits to a  battery of psychological and physical tests, and soon the  game begins in earnest.Driving home one night, Nicholas finds a wooden clown in  the driveway.  He carries the clown into the house, and  later finds an important key in the clown's mouth.  While  Nicholas watches the news on tv, reporter Daniel Schorr  talks to Nicholas, calling him by name and alerting him to at least one hidden tv camera and microphone in the room. Before long paranoia is building in Nicholas's mind as the events become more and more bizarre; there are signifigant questions about what is real and what is paranoid fantasy. And there's a beautiful woman named Christine (Deborah  Kara Unger) who changes from ally to enemy as many times  as Eva Marie Saint did in NORTH BY NORTHWEST.From here on the movie is a series of Chinese boxes, with  plot revelations coming at ten minute intervals just like  subway trains- and with the same predictability.  A big  theme of the story is that the bad guys have figured  Nicholas's mind out so well that they can predict his  every move, and his every move gets him trapped deeper and deeper.  That same element of predictability adversely  impacts the movies seemingly endless second act.Nicholas is told that the game can be stopped at any time  he wants, but Conrad confirms that it can't.  There's a  strange conversation with Conrad in which I'd swear that  about ten seconds of dialog is played twice, which gives  the scene the feel of a dream, but it isn't.Nicholas starts out with a life of luxury and comfort; the opening scene of the third act finds him having to  hitch-hike from Mexico to San Francisco, and plead with  patrons in a roadside diner to give him a ride.After making a false start with the third film in the  ALIEN series, director David Fincher came back like a  champ with SE7EN, which I felt was by far the best film to come out that year.  THE GAME is a small step back for him, one from which he'll probably recover; if SE7EN hadn't blown me away so completely, I might be more forgiving of THE GAME.  Counting uncredited ones, a total of at least four writers worked on this film.  It shows.Lord know he has a great cast to work with here.  Sure,  Michael Douglas's character is familiar to us in the first act as he plays the ruthless captain of industry, but as  the story progresses we see a more human side of Nicholas. Sean Penn is always a welcome sight, even if he does have a rather small part here.  And Deborah Kara Unger is a  good actress who may well have great things ahead of her.And that ending.  Wow, that ending.  It's not often that  I'm shouting advice to onscreen characters when I watch a  film on cable, but this time I was yelling Look out!   and No!  No!  NO!!! loud enough that even though Michael Douglas couldn't hear me, people driving by our house  probably did; hey, my family already thinks I'm strange,  what the heck.And a very important thing that I can assure readers of  without spoiling anything the story is NOT a dream nor is it a halucination brought on by any drug.  I was braced  for it to end with Nicholas sitting bolt upright in bed  drenched with sweat mumbling about what a weird dream he'd had; I didn't like that plot device in INVADERS FROM MARS  or any other movie except THE WIZARD OF OZ.Parents' note THE GAME's R rating is almost entirely for  language.

And that wasn't the only feel-like-IN-a-movie shot. The rape-scene a few minutes before the intermission is one that will always be with me. No way you can forget that part!While the movie was playing I started to realize that relatively soon the new millennium Is upon us. It would be less than 4 years or we would be there. And the science-fiction part of the movie came completely reasonable. I really think that one day virtual reality will look much like this. Isn't it at the end of 1999, then a few years after it.Also the music was a positive surprise. Not the usual classic-orientated sphere-creators but a mix of ambient, trash and techno. After the scene in which it was used, Coral Lounge kept pumpin' in my head. The end credits in combination with While the earth sleeps was\/is the best movie-ending so far. It is of a kind that lets you sit till the very end of the celluloid. When you see this part, you only could realise that you just saw one of the greatest movies of all time... or just missed it.What is more positive about this movie? Well, the script is well-considered. James Cameron did a really good job there (why didn't he do the same for  Titanic (1997)). You could take a lot of quotes out of it, and it is brought in a convincing way also. The actors really seem to mean what they say. Sometimes the script lets you think about things. Just Listen to Max's Everything has already been done-speech to give an example.After all remains one question Why wasn't it such a big success? under -advertised, too alternative, too violent? I don't know. A lot of people whom I talked about this movie- masterpiece almost all agreed with me that it is one that made the biggest impact so far (for a sneak-preview). Of all the visitors that day (april 96) the average was 7,4 - 7,5 so it could have been a hit in The Netherlands, wasn't it that it only screened in the 4 major cities. What a pity, because while it is not my personal best picture of all time, it's a very close second. A strong recommendation is placed here A world-wide re-release at the end of 1999. Don't make the same mistake as in 1995-1996 because this movie deserves much-MUCH better.
