I had my soda in one hand, my notepad in the other, I was at the height of my weekend. Then, once I saw the movies premise, I knew all was lost. It starts off great; (except for a few false jump scenes that are beginning to be quite the standard material) two characters were brutally and mysteriously murdered at night in their home a few days before Halloween. Their killer is unknown. But soon after, the film shows signs of weakness. It becomes blunt, bland, lacking suspense and irony. All my hopes went down the deep, dark drain.The film's heroine is a young, fit and strapping teenage boy. In the shape that he is in, however, you probably expect him to spend most of his hours in the school weigh lifting room, when he is not trying out for sports team. But the truth is that he doesn't even go to school. Anton (Devon Sawa) sits around all day, chowing down on junk food, smoking hard core drugs, and watching perverted television with his two friends that do the same, Mick & Pnub.When he finally discovers that his parents have been killed, several days after the occurrence, he also discovers that the psycho killer that has been around is not the neighbor next door, but him! For some reason that is never fully explained, a demon has possessed his right hand and forces him to do things against his will. He then brutally kills his friends, and arranges a date with his would-be girlfriend, Molly.From this point on, none of the story makes any sense, not necessarily because the film is far fetched, but because the movie also tries desperately to be a comedy. Yes, a comedy. Now, I am not saying that I would not call this a horror film, I'm just saying that most audiences will either go to a movie to laugh, or to be scared; the two categories seldom blend together and work. This material would have surly been much more successful if it had been played out straight.Another problem I had with the movie is the fact that I didn't care about any of the characters. All the main characters were either doing drugs, dead, on the verge of dying, or killing someone. All the side characters that didn't have a place in the movie for an instant were predictable future victims of the killer hand.And oh, that hand. It just appears everywhere now, doesn't it. So, lets say that you do buy into the fact that finger walking can take you place from place apparently quicker than any form of transportation. Can you understand that the hand can meltdown in a microwave and still be in perfectly good condition an hour later, that it can fly though the air like a bird, that it can tie a grown person on top of a car in minutes, that it can know exactly where to attack its victim but has no eyes? Lets face it, by the time this movie is over you'll be thinking to yourself Give me a break.And after all this, the filmmakers still have the audacity to force a recycled high-school love subplot in the movie. One that shows no actual sex, nudity or kissing. If you're going to put this type of element in this type of movie, don't hold back. These bodies are beautiful here, and we don't even see the main characters in an actual love scene.Even after I add in the stylish soundtrack, the realistic gore, the fact that the hand could act better than anyone on screen here, I still come up with a marginal one and one half star rating out of a possible four. However, when you waste two precious hours of your life on a beautiful weekend day in a movie which progressive gets worse, and has an ending this week that even the film's characters complain, you begin to feel charitable.

And who can argue with that? Indeed it is one of my favorites just for its adamant refusal to do things by-the-book, and many previous comments essay this film as a highly moral and spiritual piece--they couldn't be more right.  When the film came out, a lot of the reviewers commented on its cinematic brand of hipness...Being hip is cool, but I wouldn't necessarily equate that with great movies--just look at Men in Black, which was sorta fun but hardly the endurable piece of cinema that Pulp Fiction has become. So what sets it apart from the rest of the crowd?  It's exactly this spirituality...watching the film, I remember being shocked and enlightened at the same time, being unbearably tensed up and utterly charmed and in agreement with this weird California former video clerk's world view.  The film is a tour-de-force of the cinematic style; one of my favorite shots in the film seems to be a homage to both the fast-paced unbreaking style of Scorsese's Goodfellas and Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby.  It is the scene where Travolta crashes his Malibu into Eric Stoltz's front yard and brings the OD'ed Thurman inside his house.  As Rosanna Arquette hurls invectives at the two, the camera (wonderful work by Andrez Sekula moves back and forth between Arquette and Travolta and Stoltz lurching over Thurman (that's the Scorsese part).  Then, as Stoltz goes looking for the plunger, the camera follows him into a room, where it inexplicably stops at the doorway so as to impede a full sight of Stoltz, reminders of the scene where Polanski photographed Ruth Gordon in Rosemary's Baby by placing an obstruction between her and the camera so the audience would instinctively lurch their head to the side, making a hopeless attempt to see around the obstruction.  Such a phrase can be used to describe Pulp Fiction most movies simply unfurl their stories at the audience.  This movie subliminally makes you a part of the action.  I recently had a semi-argument with a friend over the worth of this film over Natural Born Killers.

In the style of David Spade, It's called hypocrisy, Oliver--check into it!  Anyways, I digress.  Anybody who bad-mouths this movie indeed has no appreciation for cinema; sure, the film may have a goof or an errant philosophy somewhere , but Tarantino fulfilled any filmmaker's dream in revitalizing cinema.  You can say that the film's tone didn't impress you, that its style wasn't to your taste...but you can't deny the artistry that went into it.  Morality? For all of those who believe this film is an amoral travesty, I suggest you rent the family favorite The Santa Clause and count how many times Disney shamelessly milks its own products, or if God is mentioned even once in what is supposed to be a Christmas film.

Then, as Stoltz goes looking for the plunger, the camera follows him into a room, where it inexplicably stops at the doorway so as to impede a full sight of Stoltz, reminders of the scene where Polanski photographed Ruth Gordon in Rosemary's Baby by placing an obstruction between her and the camera so the audience would instinctively lurch their head to the side, making a hopeless attempt to see around the obstruction.  Such a phrase can be used to describe Pulp Fiction most movies simply unfurl their stories at the audience.  This movie subliminally makes you a part of the action.  I recently had a semi-argument with a friend over the worth of this film over Natural Born Killers.  Now don't get me wrong, Oliver Stone is a powerful filmmaker, but his film banged you over the head incessantly with points like I'm Going to Use my Artistic License to Satirize the Over-the-Top Violence of Popular Culture by Making a Movie Replete With...Over-the-Top Violence!  In the style of David Spade, It's called hypocrisy, Oliver--check into it!  Anyways, I digress.  Anybody who bad-mouths this movie indeed has no appreciation for cinema; sure, the film may have a goof or an errant philosophy somewhere , but Tarantino fulfilled any filmmaker's dream in revitalizing cinema.  You can say that the film's tone didn't impress you, that its style wasn't to your taste...but you can't deny the artistry that went into it.  Morality? For all of those who believe this film is an amoral travesty, I suggest you rent the family favorite The Santa Clause and count how many times Disney shamelessly milks its own products, or if God is mentioned even once in what is supposed to be a Christmas film.  Or in ANY family film.  What impressed me the most when I first saw Pulp Fiction was its inclusion of God at all, many Generation-X filmmakers (paging Kevin Smith?) are so agnostic in their beliefs that it was so refreshing to see one that painted divinity in such a positive light. You can have those other indie favorites Chasing Amy and Good Will Hunting(both starring those irritating crybabies Matt Damon and Ben Affleck), and if you like those cynical films which are basically reworkings of oh-feel-sorry-for-me melodramas of the late-40s reworked with equally irritating alternative rock (best summed up by the Smashing Pumpkins in a Simpsons episode All's we got is our millions of dollars, our legions of fans, and our youth.), then you can have them. Compare that to Jules' awakening (I was just sitting here eating my muffin and drinking my coffee when I had what alcoholics refer to as 'a moment of clarity'.) and you'll see how Tarantino turned the mythic Gen-X stereotype on its head as well. Pulp Fiction is, in my opinion, the king of the indies and one of the best examples of cinematic craftsmanship ever.

I came out of this film feeling really dispirited and depressed, primarily because none of my expectations for a Cronenburg film were fulfilled.As soon as I saw the organic game pods, I laughed and was pleased, but the kind of development I was expecting of that idea did not materialise.  The gore and the organic props were simply displayed to us, as if that was enough to create a visceral response.  I'm afraid I found the scene in the Chinese Restaurant no more disturbing than actually eating chicken's feet for real.Too many of the action and plot points were set up in advance (such as the bony gun), leading to a lack of suspense.I think the worst aspect of the film is that there was no emotional involvement at any level.  Nothing was done to make us feel empathy with the characters.  The fact that we are in a game, and that game dialogue is trite and inane, is no excuse to use trite and inane dialogue throughout the film. The performances suffered as a result, and I was most disappointed in Jennifer Jason Leigh, who appeared to be sleepwalking through the whole movie.  The love scene seemed to be put in gratuitously just to show us some kissing.  Also Jude Law was completely miscast - his role should have gone to Christopher Ecclestone who, for our American friends who may not have seen him, is one of the most intense and powerful screen actors around. Law failed to convince that he was really scared or worried by developments.  One minute he is phobic about having his body penetrated, the next he is consenting to a spinal operation with scarcely a shrug.  Of course, if he's playing a game, he wouldn't be worried, no more than I am by playing Doom.  But a film has to use fear and uncertainty as a dramatic device to draw the audience into the story, and this is where eXistenZ failed completely.I think Cronenburg likes to think that the world he creates in his movies is existentialist and unemotional, but the fact remains that his best films, specifically The Dead Zone, The Fly and Dead Ringers (I haven't seen M. Butterfly), all work because of their emotional power.  The musical scores for these films (all by Howard Shore) all serve to underline the emotional undercurrent, but in eXistenZ the score is simply trying to create a response which isn't provided by the film, and gives the same impression of hack-work which the rest of the film provokes.  Furthermore, if we take the example of The Fly, the theme of physical transformation is very clearly expressed and deeply explored.  In eXistenZ, I could see from the plot that Cronenburg's theme involved the nature of reality, but I found no deep exploration of this theme, unlike in, say, Videodrome.The whole film suffers very badly from having a small budget.  The various game worlds we are shown are all very small-scale and cramped - not even up to the standard of modern role-playing games.  Also the props and the special effects looked cheap, with only the bio-port in the characters' backs remotely convincing.  I feel that Cronenburg should have made some other film for the money he had, and to wait until he could raise enough money to make eXistenZ on a much larger canvas.  This also affected the ending of the film, which came too quickly, and seemed quite perfunctory. The fact that the world of reality was one in which there is a battle between gameplayers and realists, and that the world of the game was a world in which there was a battle between gameplayers and realists, and so on ad infinitum, seemed to indicate a distinct lack of imagination on Cronenburg's part, and undoubtedly gave away the ending, at least for me.When the film was coming to it's (for want of a better word) climax, I couldn't believe it - nothing had happened yet!  Even when the final twist happened, nothing major was at stake.  I didn't care whether we were still playing a game or whether this was the real reality.  We never found out enough about reality to know if the conflict between gameplayers and Realists was meaningful.  In the end, the entire film could have been made as one of the less intriguing episodes of the Outer Limits (the Twilight Zone has already been cited), and certainly the so-called twist-in-the-tail ending was every bit as predictable as one from one of those programmes.I feel that Cronenburg should avoid writing his films from now on.  In the early days of Scanners, The Brood and Videodrome (similarly emotionless in tone), the films were worth watching because nothing like them had been seen before.  As his career developed, the films were worth watching because he combined visceral imagery with strong emotionality.  Now we are back to just strong images with no emotional involvement, and in 1999 the imagery simply isn't strong enough to excite interest any more.  These same problems afflicted Crash, his last film.  For me, Dead Ringers remains his best film.The film is worth seeing, if you have never watched any of Cronenburg's past stuff, and you have had no exposure to science fiction.  Otherwise, there's nothing new or provocative in this film to make it worth watching.

To each his own, I suppose, but _Under Capricorn_ boasts some of the most beautiful photography and eloquent, literate dialogue to be found in any Hitchcock film.  Although the plot and structure of the film are familiar (the quintessential love triangle, ala _Wuthering Heights_), Hitchcock's treatment raises it above the ordinary.

Hitchcock's experiments with the ten-minute take (with which he experimented in his previous film, _Rope_) also add to the film's interest. The film is not, of course, an artistic triumph for Hitchcock alone. Ingrid Bergman and Joseph Cotten (to name only two) are stars of the caliber that one just doesn't see anymore, and they give worthy performances. Casting Ingrid Bergman as an Irish noblewoman is, of course, rather bizarre casting against type, but this great actress makes it work.

The other actors, mostly little-known to American audiences, fill their roles well more than adequately and the very fact that they are unfamiliar makes them easier for the viewer to see as the characters they play rather than as stars.

Emily Watson throws herself into the part of Jackie with the same self-conscious dedication she displayed in Breaking the Waves, but I kept feeling in both performances that I was watching a talented drama student going through a two-hour acting exercise.  She has yet to draw me in.  The storytelling style is interesting.  Part of the film is told from Hilary's perspective, and then the film retraces some of the same events as told from Jackie's point of view.  This is an innovative new way to approach the docudrama, a genre that's best approached as fiction based on fact.  Some of the film's scenes are mystifying  at one point, late in her illness, Jackie receives a call from her husband and gets suspicious when she thinks she hears a baby's voice in the background.  We do indeed get a glimpse of a baby running around Barenboim's room, but it's never explained whose it is. Anyone have an explanation?

Even the Lion King went along these lines. I believe what makes a good movie, is an original story plot line such as Star Wars (Which I think is a masterpiece) It's time for Shakespeare to roll over and give George Lucas the literature crown. I didn't like the dialogue. Now I do know that this is famous poetry we are talking about, but I would like to be able to understand what they are saying. Through out most of it I was lost. An example of that would have to be when you first meet Keanu Reeves character, I wasn't sure if he was represented as good or evil. I also felt that all of these characters were extremely flaky.

Jaw-droppingly beautiful and talented. I have seen most of his other films and he gives his whole self to each role, whether it is as a lawyer, a murder-minded college student, or a tragic French soldier. He has more talent in his little finger than most other hot young actors. The only other actor that I feel has as much captivating screen presence and intelligence is Ewan McGregor. And they are drastically different actors.Vartan brings such charm and earnestness to his role as Sam Coulson. His romance with Drew was touching and believable because of their on-screen chemistry. I know that if I had an English teacher that good looking when I was in high school ten years ago, I never would have gone to college.Vartan is going to hit the stratosphere. I'm very happy to see him get such a pivotal role in a major studio pick. Drew deserves credit for pressuring the studio to hire him even though he doesn't have a big name. That will certainly change. ","genre":null},{"date":"6 May 1999","score":"","review":"  I have read a lot comments about this movie, some being very favorable and others trashing it.

I have seen most of his other films and he gives his whole self to each role, whether it is as a lawyer, a murder-minded college student, or a tragic French soldier. He has more talent in his little finger than most other hot young actors. The only other actor that I feel has as much captivating screen presence and intelligence is Ewan McGregor. And they are drastically different actors.Vartan brings such charm and earnestness to his role as Sam Coulson. His romance with Drew was touching and believable because of their on-screen chemistry. I know that if I had an English teacher that good looking when I was in high school ten years ago, I never would have gone to college.Vartan is going to hit the stratosphere. I'm very happy to see him get such a pivotal role in a major studio pick. Drew deserves credit for pressuring the studio to hire him even though he doesn't have a big name. That will certainly change.

I must say that this movie was a wonderful romantic comedy, the kind that I, a cynical moviegoer, loved wholehearted.Sure the plot has holes (as a magazine editor, I had trouble believing that a copy editor would have two assistants) but they are easily forgotten because of the charm of the movie and its talented cast, mainly Drew and Michael Vartan.Drew Barrymore was at her charming, engaging best. What other young actress of her fame and talent would allow herself to look so unattractive most of the film? To humiliate herself in front of millions by dancing like a dork? Certainly not that insipid Gwyneth Paltrow or any of the other hot young actresses. Drew is one of the few who is willing to go the extra distance. Her transformation from ugly duckling to beautiful swan is both exhilarating and painful to watch.

From its very start, to its end this movie will keep you watching. The story line is so rich, and so deep, to fully appreciate it you'll have to watch the movie several times. Parts that seem useless or pointless (When I was young my mom told me not to stare into the sun, so once when I was 6, I did) make complete sense when viewed with the rest of the movie. The movie also has rather deep religious implications, teaching order instead of chaos. This movie will have you thinking for long after you see it. At first you may not get it, but once you look at the big picture it all becomes clear. The directing is great, and adds some tension in some parts. The music is fantastic, and gets your blood flowing. This is one of the best movies ever made, and I think everybody should take a look at it.

The problem with Simon Birch can be encapsulated in Jim Carey's unheralded appearance as the film's narrator.  With his best I-desperately-want-you-to-like-me voice, he sweetly intones his lines earnestly and with a great sense of anticipation, however he never really transcends a vapid flavor of Jack Handey-ness about his presentation. In fact, the whole movie resembles an extended Deep Thoughts, from the scenery down to the sentiment that at times out-sacchrine's sacchrine.To its credit, Simon Birch has some earnest moments that actually work. Like the John Irving novel it was based on (A Prayer for Owen Meaney), the film has many fascinating plot twists and developments, but it is essentially a character exploration, and to that end Irving (and Birch) will reveal or hint at key plot developments early on so that you are free to enjoy how the characters evolve. And there are many fascinating characters to examine Simon himself, his friend Joe (Joseph Mazzello), Joe's mother, Joe's grandmother, Simon's parents, and so forth.The central failing of Simon Birch, ironically, sits squarely on Simon's shoulders. The boy is cute, no denying that, notwithstanding his often preternaturally awkward, chitchatty preoccupations with breasts that becomes annoyingly omnipresent.  The film revolved around the question of his divine calling he knows God has a purpose for him, he tells everyone so. And yet when the fateful moment finally arrives, you've been so set up for something, well, truly miraculous that what actually does occur makes you go, oh, is that it? The payoff for this set-up is something that could easily be relegated to good fortune or ideal timing. The film even goes a long (and often ridiculous) way to set things up so that Simon can become the hero he becomes, but once again, the moment isn't so much divine as it is, well, fortuitous and nothing more. Maybe what Simon Birch is trying to say that ordinary heroism is itself divine, but if that is true, it swathes that ordinary heroism in so much sentiment and patent unordinariness that you are sure exactly what the message is. The movie is too concerned with making you cry at the end to consider its own ambiguous message.Joseph Mazzello is also becoming a potential problem. I enjoy his work, from the brat in Jurassic Park and the genuinely affecting tyke in Shadowlands. But as he's grown older, he hasn't shown too much development as an actor. Granted, he's young still, but he is beginning to show the limits of his range. His Simon Birch character is virtually indistinguishable from his Shadowlands and The Cure characters. He's seems to rely too much on his cute factor and the movie's cute factor to get him through some tough acting spots, and it is beginning to show.The best actor of the bunch, Ashley Judd, also has the least amount of screen time.  Though her limited time is woefully inadequate to her talents, she manages to show grace and dignity with what she has to work with. Judd is one of those rare actors who looks equally appropriate in a period piece as she does in contemporary films (and even sci-fi, as evidenced in her work as a recurring character on Star Trek The Next Generation), and I trust that she will find better showcases for her as yet untapped reservoir of talent.And thus Simon Birch collapses on itself because of too many good intentions spent on too flimsy a premise. Jim Carey, on his eternal quest for screen-cred, will have to keep mugging wistfully in more pictures before he gets its just right. Simon Birch could have used a lot more sincerity.
