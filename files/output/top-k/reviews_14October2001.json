Their lives change in ways they never imagined. Hearts in Atlantis is about a man who has his world turned upside down when he finds out that two of his childhood friends have past away. In a trip back to his old neighborhood to see the house where he grew up, Robert Garfield (David Morse) begins to reminisce about his younger years, in particular a time when a strange old man by the name of Ted Brautigan (Anthony Hopkins) moves into the suite above his. The old man is quiet and a bit reclusive yet Robert and Ted build a friendship that is stronger than most life long friendships. At the time, Robert's life primarily revolved around two friends. His relationship with his mom is almost non-existent as she is preoccupied with furthering her own career and lavishing herself with new clothes and socializing with corporate types. The old man becomes a more of a parental figure than his own mother but to make things even more interesting, the old man possesses psychic powers that seem to affect those around him, especially Robert.What made this movie good? Well for one, Anthony Hopkins. There is no doubt that this man can act. He plays every character as if he has spent years researching the subject. He has a peculiar rhythm to the delivery of his lines yet it works and makes the character all the more believable. It's seldom you find something to criticize Anthony Hopkins about and in this movie there is nothing but good to say. David Morse is another wonderful actor. Although he rarely has the lead role, his presence is never missed. In this movie, he is in the movie briefly at the beginning to establish the direction of the story and at the end to wrap it up but like Hopkins he immerses himself in the character and delivers a beautiful performance however brief it was.However, my loudest compliments go to Anton Yelchin. This young man plays the young Bobby Garfield and plays it well. I have to be honest and admit that when I first saw the actor of young bobby Garfield, I wasn't sure about this young man but as the movie progressed, he grew on me and I found his performance to be very convincing. This is quite the achievement when you realize that this young actor is a major character and must practically carry the movie since most of the story takes place around him. Very good performance.The pace of the movie was a bit odd but it fell in line with the plot line. If you were looking for a bit of action, you're not going to find it here. But if you want something that is intriguing this is the movie for you.Overall, I really enjoyed this movie. It's a slower paced introspective type of a storyline but it's beautifully done. You'll find yourself intrigued by Hopkins's character and be amazed at young Yelchin's acting.

(Artificial Intelligence) a promising title seems a justified statement; But as becomes apparent from the above remark, the film does not meet most expectations.It should have been a movie by two of the most remarkable directors from the world of cinema. Kubrick wrote the screenplay, but he found to be lacking experience in some respects (special effects). That was the reason for him contacting Steven Spielberg, who with movies like ET and Jurassic Park clearly had shown what he was capable of. Unfortunately Kubrick died while the movie was a mere concept. Spielberg seemed to be the obvious person to finish the job, with the book Super Toys Last All Summer Long, by Brian Aldiss, and Kubricks notes for the screenplay (based on this book) at hand.* those who want to see the movie unopiniated are discouraged to read any further *The movie starts with an introduction of A.I. mechas  (robots)  are the solution mankind found in the near future to the problem of scarce resources. The voiceover who announces these facts annoys from the start but can be justified as the easiest was of telling about the origins of A.I.Then the viewer gets to know an enthusiastic scientist, who has come up with the idea of creating robots that are able to love. Mechas up to this point were able to function independantly and learn, but were not able to love their world consisted of mere definitions. The question imposes itself wether emotionless, but self-learning and &#150;acting robots are actually feasible. Via a time leap we are then introduced to a family who's only son is in a coma. Due to this fact they are selected as a test-case for the first love-capable robot, a boy called David. Though somewhat predictable the mother gets attached to David (though she despises the idea at first) and after a while she even decides to activate the love-routine. This massively interferes with the concept of love, because it makes it seem like love is only a matter of programming. The dramatic point in this part of the movie is when the son awakes from his coma and returns home. The parents are confronted with David, who is suddenly regarded redundant by the father, though the mother still has feeling for the robot. Legitimate points are made regarding the ethical issues concerning A.I.  and the responsibility of &#145;creators' and &#145;parents'. It is decided to leave David in a gloomy forest, to prevent him from being destructed (since love-activited robots cannot be reprogrammed they have to be destructed once redundant). Kubricks influence is ever so clear he had a dark view of mankind (consider movies like Eyes Wide Shot, and A Clockwork Orange), and in this phase of the movie he rattles the cage of your conscience. Spielberg is a much more optimistic director consider movies like  ET and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, even Schindler's List. During the movie this difference remains painfully clear.The theme detachment is further developed in the second part of the movie a spectacular, though slightly overdone, flesh fair (in which robots are executed as a celebration of real life and out of fear for A.I.)  causes a increase in the pass of the movie. Although the idea might very well have originted in Kubricks mind, the cinematographical realisation is clearly Jurassic Park. The story changes to a modern Pinokkio (which also had temporarily been the working title of Kubrick's screenplay), in which David goes on a quest for the Blue Fairy, who will be able to turn him into a real boy. He is convinced that this will make his &#145;mother' love him again. Again a brilliant idea a robot pursuing a dream. But the pass of the movie steeply drops, and scenes are annoyingly slow. A nice part for Gigolo Joe and Teddy the Bear (clearly a cuddly family film character introduced by Spielberg) are few of the only things that make the movie worthwile in this part. A glimpse of Kubrick surfaces in the moment where David meets the scientist who created him, during his quest for the Blue Fairy. This scene is situated at &#145;the end of the world', which ironically is situated in Manhattan (flooded by the smelting of the icecaps), with the skyline-dominating Twin Towers of the former WTC. Some people will undoubtedly appreciate the fact that this hasn't been removed from the film, but I think nevertheless that scenes in which planes crash into buildings and David tries to commit suicide by jumping of skyscrapers, must be painfull for many people involved in the New York tragedy. In a submerged themepark David subsequently finds a Blue Fairy statue, to whom he indefinitely keeps repeating his prair for becoming human. For some reason Spielberg saw it fit to trap Davids vehicle beneath a collapsing Wheel. The necessity for this is completely absent, and I think the scene would only have made a stronger impact if David had decided out of his own free will to stay there. Spielberg seems to be entangled in the (otherwise very well constructed) special effects.In the Aldiss book and Kubrick screenplay, the story continues after thousands of years. David is discovered by very advanced mechas who &#150; after they have revived him &#150; learn about their human ancestors, who are now long extinct. This concept has been completely abolished in the movie. Spielberg makes the mechas look like aliens reminiscent of Close Encounters; he seems to be unable to let go of the friendly-alien-fetish. The film gets trapped in cliches and the epoch it could have been (and of which glimpses can every now and then be seen) is in long epilogue definitely wrecked. Besides that there are all kinds of errors in this third and final part of the movie. For instance, huge amounts of water were frozen, but there has been not apparent change of volume. Most of the buildings would have been wrecked by the expanding water, and the skyline would have changed dramatically. Then there are the mecha\/aliens who at first speak a language of their own, but later on they speak English (even in the absence of David, which could have given an explanation). Furthermore there are the scientific inaccuracies David's dream seems to come through when the aliens tell him they can revive a person from the past on the bases of their DNA. This is highly unlikely, since many things like memories, are not stored in the genetic code, but it becomes really improbably when they say they only can do so for a single day because of a twist in spacetime. A needlessly long and forced ending, in perfect Hollywood cliches, in which David gets the chance to spend a final day with his mother; after that he can finally go to sleep, the light are turned of one by one, and the voiceover spawns its last needless remarks. There seems to be only one suitable reactions to this laugh away the embarrasment of such an ending.The movie obviously owes a great deal to Spielberg, regarding the specials effects, but lacks the influence of a more cynical director. The impact is much less than an average Kubrick movie. It makes you wonder who could have completed the daunting task (with or without the cooperation of Steven Spielberg). Roman Polanski comes to mind, or perhaps David Lynch or Spike Lee. It would definitely have made the movie more challenging.Considering everything, Spielberg made a movie which makes you swim in shallow water good for some fun.

I just saw this movie today for the first time on the USA Network.  My VCR is one of those that records the start and stop of the commercials.  The feature is called Commercial Advance - Well, luck (for me anyway) would have it, it fast-forwarded through the entire movie as I was making popcorn.  Watching this movie was about as painful as going to the dentist.  First of all.. Where did they get these lame names from, Zach (Saved by the Bell?), Dean (License to Drive?) and Preston (What is a Preston?) - The acting in this movie was about as bad as the miscasts.  I gagged at the 3 worded answers that Zach was throwing at his parents during the parents-are-usually-this-interrogative, gee whiz.  *sigh* After watching the next scene, I really wondered when the movie was actually filmed; all the letters of acceptance lacked Zip codes.  Moving along....  The party  Bathroom scene See Nowhere which was the direction the movie was going at that point.  Oh oh oh and the Prom.  I was getting flashbacks.  The Saturday Night Fever & Dirty Dancing mix was sickning.  By the way, from where did they get Tallulah Bankhead from?

I think it was the latter. First of all, it was inaccurate in many small, yet important details. One of the first things I noticed was, during Winston's day to day life in his work, his conversations, eating in the cafeteria, etc. he feels free to look unhappy and make suggestive glances at people without immense fear. One of the most important parts of the book, was that even in small activities it was virtually impossible to safely show even a hint of his true emotions on his face AT ANY MOMENT. This is also shown in the scenes on the streets of the proletarions. In the book Winston knew that this was a huge risk to wander around there and was skeptical and frightened at every trip. While in the movie, he does it so often and without fear, that you lose the important feeling of heavy surveillance and risk right off the bat.Other minor inaccuracies included Winston hiding his diary in the wall, yes a very small change, but it begs the question, what's the point? There was also the most annoying thing a director can do with a book, and that is morphing characters. The large inaccuracies were far more disturbing, however. First of all, one of the important pieces of the book is that Big Brother is a government based on an intelligent, yet crude philosophy. In the movie, they skip that and go straight to making you think that the government is run by Hitler with technology. Which is true, in a sense, when directed with its facism, but if that's all you get out of Big Brother, you really missed the point of the book. The terrifying thing about Big Brother is that, in a way, it has some points behind its philosophy. When O'Brien is picking at Winstons mind in the Ministry of Love, he is LISTENING to everything Winston says against Big Brother. The fact that he listens, and advances forward in his philosophy, is in effect what is most creepy and intriguing. In the end, (careful SPOILER ahead) when Winston says he loves Big Brother, the terrifying thing is that you are not sure whether it was souly the beating and torture that caused this, or the actual power behind the philosophy. I am in no way saying that the Big Brother's philosophy has points that appeal to me, but its intelligence and depth is what makes this book incredibly disturbing. Also, how could anyone feel any connection between Julia and Winston in the film? It was awful, no connection whatsoever. And where was O'Brien before he gave Winston his address? One of the things that carried the book was Winstons thoughts about O'Brien BEFORE he made contact with him. In the movie, they just jump the gun. But that about sums up why this movie was a terrible adaption because its impossible NOT to jump the gun and morph characters in less than two hours. How could anyone think this movie was watchable if it was under two hours? At the very least, the movie demands 3 hours to be able to capture some of the important moods and connections. Anything less is just pointless.If you loved the book, and I mean TRULY adored it, you will not approve of this movie, and chances are, you already knew you wouldn't. Because the book is unfilmable, and this movie just proves how impossible it is cram something decent into a small reel of film.Two stars out of ten ","genre":null},{"date":"14 October 2001","score":"29 out of 54 people found the following review useful","review":"  I saw this movie literally directly after finishing the book, and maybe that was a neutral idea or a very stupid one.

It was a very cool idea (on paper) and the rumor that this was for real was a very intelligent way to get peoples attention but the movie should have stayed on paper.Sorry to say but this is a really crappy movie.Just plain waste of time and money (if you were stupid enough to buy it as I did).Anyway I will watch the sequel someday.
