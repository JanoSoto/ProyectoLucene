Murnau's greatest piece of cinema as a director; that claim would probably go to Sunrise, or depending on the mood Nosferatu. But it is an attempt at presenting a side of reality that is not very sympathetic, yet at the same time takes has a lot of heart in its core. Murnau and writer Carl Meyer make very clear what it is about this one specific man, in relation to his job, his co-workers, his close living quarters with his fellow tenants, and how dignity can be the make or break factor in living a worthwhile life. Emil Jannings plays this man, and his total embodiment- nevermind performance- of the character of the porter, who gets stripped of his long, long-standing duties, as well as his impressionable uniform, is one big factor in making The Last Laugh as deep as it is. In terms of its essential story elements it's reminiscent of one of those working-class tragic tales out of 19th century Russian literature, or even from Dickens. But Murnau and Mayer make it specifically a story of dignity and a sense of entitlement as a double-edged sword, and that society is not very much one to turn the other cheek and not have a laugh at someone else's expense.Simply put, the porter comes into work one day, and without any notice is told that his work as, essentially, the doorman to the Atlantic (a posh restaurant\/hotel), will no longer be needed, and is downsized to being the washroom attendant in the downstairs bathroom. This crushes his ego and his spirit, and the uniform, which they strip away from him, becomes an immense point of merit, bringing it home with him still on (in one of the best scenes in the film, as Murnau glides his camera across quickly the lobby as the porter runs past the sleeping bellhops), even during a night-long wedding celebration. He continues this into the next morning, however showing signs that he's already being mentally worn down to a nub. The woman who helps mend his uniform comes by to pay him a visit, thinking that he's still the doorman. It's someone else (a great, brief iris shot of the new doorman), and she suddenly sees a peek at him, horrified, as is he naturally to see her seeing himself in such a lowly position. Once word spreads in the tenement, it's one large notch lower when the porter heads back to his home, uniform still in tow.There will be much read into, as it would be if it were a short story, to the symbolism of the uniform. I think it's not just a sign of status, but something that keeps this man's own mental stability and sense of self-worth- not just in a job position sense but in a kind of existential way too (if existentialism is what I think it is)- and at his old age and lack of family or many friends is what at the least marks him as a total shlub. There's no middle ground in Mayer\/Murnau's vision of society, and it's one of the more thought-provoking aspects to see the nature of the people living his tenement, and how they react to the porter's fall from grace (only one, the newlywed, shows some genuine sadness for what he's lost), and how they're not very much different from those who frequent the restroom the porter has to work at like a dog. And yet, there is at this point a complete reversal of fortune, literally and figuratively, for the porter, as he becomes a millionaire by the other side of the coin of luck that tossed into that low-level job in the first place. It ends on an ironically hopeful note, as he becomes like a jovial Santa Claus off duty, giving out money this way and that (not least of which to the new washroom attendant, in a very funny and poignant scene).There is a level of cynicism however right in the one true-blue inter title in the film (it was studio pressure, not Murnau's original intention, to have the 'happy' ending), but it works in showing how the more important thing, not riches but dignity, becomes restored in spades. It's meant to be, after so much time spent in the bottomless pit of despair that the ex-doorman has been in, a big reprieve, and it is, yet it doesn't come off as being too cheap because of Murnau and Meyer still staying true to a certain reality in this environment. This has come after, of course, Murnau has emptied himself of many incredibly innovative cinematic tricks. In The Last Laugh there are many memorable sequences; there's a dream, for example, with what might be the first hand-held camera, as it glides shakily and blurry-like past some people at a table. Or that there are the many instances of the point of view, by Karl Freund's unyielding camera movements, provoking the audience to feel the tension and inform the sense of moral dread, and in the most expressionist move in making the environment itself as an element dwarfing the characters (both the Atlantic and the tenement- the latter in one long, fantastic shot showing from night to day- are the key ones).On the technical side of things, The Last Laugh, as what could be considered something of an anomaly, benefits from not having the usual inter-titles popping in at every other dialog exchange. By doing this, there's nothing in the way of something close to pure expression of cinema through pantomime, music, and mood through editing and the camera, and Murnau, Mayer, Freund and Jannings combine to make one of the greatest of silent films.

While the three don't know each other, their lives are soon to be intertwined. Macao is essentially run by a gambler and crook named Vincent Halloran (Brad Dexter). He's always on the look out for American cops looking to put the clamp on his operation and take him back to the U.S. to stand trial. Halloran is convinced that one of the new arrivals, Nick Cochran (Robert Mitchum), is his man and wants to get him off the island before Cochran can get the drop on him. Complicating matters is Julie Benson (Jane Russell), who both Cochran and Halloran have a thing for, and Lawrence C. Trumble (William Bendix), a man who seems just a bit too interested in what's going on in Macao.It's not that Macao is a bad movie, but you can certainly find better. Macao does nothing outstanding or overly memorable that allows it to rise much above the average mark. Take the film's two leads, Robert Mitchum and Jane Russell. I thought the pair was pretty good in His Kind of Woman. But here they're basically playing the same roles. It's the same relationship and dialogue all over again. How about something to spice things up a bit? The rest of the movie is similarly uneventful. Brad Dexter's tough guy Halloran isn't that tough. Thomas Gomez's Lt. Sebastian isn't as slimy and underhanded as he might have been. And William Bendix's character is far too easy to see through and figure out his motivations. Like I said, it's not that Macao is bad, it's just not as good as it could or should have been. If you enjoy watching Robert Mitchum play the same role he played dozens of times and if you enjoy watching Jane Russell sing and wear fabulous clothes, Macao might be the movie for you. If you want real excitement, suspense, and drama and the chance to see Mitchum and Russell do something that will wow you, you'll be disappointed.

Desptie it being over-budget and under-whelming at the box-office, what remains is probably one of the director's most provocative turns, with so much thrust into it that one ends up admiring the whole so much that it can be forgiven that it veers into the bulky side of things. It's near-classic pulp melodrama fused with the grace and intelligence of the Hollywood musicals and crime pictures of the period that would come shortly after the events in this film. It's also at times utterly pleasurable as conventional fare that knows what it is, as well as visually flourishing in cinematography and editing to go a little further with the material. It's risky stuff not because of the story in and of itself, but because of the chances Coppola takes with putting so much together. Unlike one of his contemporaries, Scorsese, and his film New York, New York, the Cotton Club even in its most dragging or trickiest points in the narrative reigns high as an original hybrid by giving something captivating on every side of the coin.Acting-wise, Coppola goes for the big ensemble once again (a trademark of his films in the 80s), with the key ones allowing for the director to put a lot into each smaller group. The stars as the drenched-in-formula good looking' musician-cum-actor (Richard Gere) and the girl on the side for one of the big mob bosses in New York City (Diane Lane). the gangsters, all with specific characteristics that gain momentum as the story goes, like Dutch Schultz (James Remar) as the possessive paranoid killer, Bob Hoskins and Fred Gwynne (what a combo) as certain 'business interests' entwined with the rest of the mob, and Nicolas Cage as Gere's younger brother, a hot-head racist who wants to take over; the black actors, singers, dancers, all right out of Harlem and with its own stars (Gregory Hines, in one of his very best performances\/roles), and criminals (Fishburne as a key part of this group). And the club itself is something of a character- as principle location- unto itself, as some surreal bastion of escapist glee (if your part of the audience) and gangland violence and bad race vibes (if not). Coppola also has the occasional side character, like the MC at the club played by Tom Waits (made believable all by a cigar), to not make either side too top-heavy.Whether one side bests the other or not is arguable. It's hard to say that there aren't some noteworthy scenes in practically every turn, even if they tend to go over-the-top (like Remar with Schultz) or almost too much on young charisma (Lane and sometimes Gere). It's a credit to Coppola, at least on that front, that he corrals moments- like the break-up\/reuniting with Sandman and Clay Williams, or between the two main stars when they're literally between white sheets backstage at the club- that add up to a lot in the grand scheme of things. His other main concerns, however, are music and the subtle presence of the camera.

After her roommates leave for work the next day, the guy shows up at her home and attempts to rape her. The story takes a surprising twist when, at one point, the woman turns the tables on the man and is able to overpower him; but when she realizes there is no way that attempted rape can be proved and if the man is arrested, he will just get off, she decides to keep him prisoner in the house until she can get a confession out of him. Far-fetched? Maybe. Disturbing? Definitely, but there's a wonderfully claustrophobic feel about this film, especially the middle with just the woman and her attacker, that you can't help but feel completely a part of what's going on. I did not see the play on Broadway, but I would imagine a piece like this works better onstage, but that doesn't make this film any less riveting an experience. Farrah Fawcett, one of the last actresses to do the role on Broadway, was awarded the role of Marjorie in the film version and delivers a taut and deeply moving performance as the victim who refuses to be a victim. Many critics found Fawcett's performance to be one-note, but for me, Marjorie is a woman completely numbed by what she has been through and the performance works for me. James Russo, in the performance of his career, is slimy and menacing as the would-be rapist who finds Marjorie to be much more of a challenge than he assumed. Alfre Woodard and Diana Scarwid co-star as Marjorie's roommates, who come home after Marjorie has overpowered the guy and has him tied up and stuffed in their fireplace upon their arrival. And it's the arrival of the roommates that take the story to an unexpected level because they didn't see what we saw Marjorie go through and therefore, think she should call the police and let them handle the guy. Not for the faint of heart, but if you can stand it, a gripping film experience anchored by a lead performance that will surprise you.

Although fans of Beatty's work on Bonnie and Clyde and Reds may find this film a trifle by comparison, nevertheless, solid performances and a sharp screenplay by Elaine May and Beatty have kept this near classic fresh for almost thirty years.As Joe Pendleton, a quarterback who is snatched from his body before his time by an over-eager angel, Beatty is all good-natured charm, especially as Austin Farnsworth, the first replacement body that he tries on for size. Beatty surrounded himself with a great cast of supporting players.

However, the scene-stealers are Charles Grodin as Farnsworth's scheming, double-crossing secretary and Dyan Cannon as Farnsworth's unfaithful wife. Whenever these two are together, the film hits its comedy high notes.Directed by Beatty and Buck Henry, the film's production values are first class.

A young blind girl, Emily (Sarah Keller) warns Liza and tells her to leave as soon as she can, something that obviously Liza doesn't do.And as everybody involved with the Seven Doors Hotel encounters gruesome deaths, Dr. John McCabe (David Warbeck), the doctor who treated the painter and examined both Joe and Schweik's corpses (Schweik's was found by Joe and seen by Liza in the bathroom of room 36) begins to get involved with Liza and to investigate the mystery... but will they survive the BEYOND?

It isn't about whom really did it; it's about the fact that you may never know. But what's more important than you never knowing is that a person can fix his or herself which is what you see at the end; a sort of light at the end of the tunnel effect.Kurosawa is an excellent director. He was the first to point out the deception of human beings, through camera angles and verbal cues. I thought the actors were amazing. I thought he sort of showed that anyone, even those of court, may be deceptive, but he did so in a very respectful way. He had the poor man flicking off bugs and laughing like a crazy man, which I thought was hilarious because he was so unbelievably psychotic. He then showed us the very well put-together wife and samurai. Kurosawa then smacked everyone in the face by showing us even those of court can be deceptive, which is hard to take.However at the end when he showed the woodcutter showing that he really wanted to change his ways and not be evil, Kurosawa gives us a taste of hope. The most interesting thing in the whole movie, though, is when we see the woodcutter walking away from his own ignorance, and the rain stops, but the monk is still stuck in the ignorance. I thought that was such a good way of showing that even if you're religious you may still have to find your own way. The monk didn't show him the way, the woodcutter found it on his own.Despite so many genius ways of portraying an idea, there are still some things that may drive an American audience crazy, such as the very long camera shots that follow the characters, but to get the point of the movie you'll just have to get over it. To find out what Kurosawa is really saying you have to look at it through a non-American perspective. You have to get over the long camera shots following the people, the screaming baby the monk can't hold it the right way, the very weird eyebrows on the women, and the fact that you want to know who committed the crime. So the only people I would not recommend this to those who cannot get past this, but if you can it's worth watching.

The thing looks like a very, very big budget school play, or indeed, a very very low budget action movie, which it actually is. It's been said on many occasions that this was the last of the genre entries, and I do hope it was. The genre didn't die peacefully, but in horrible agony, amidst a lot of smoke, fake blood and lousy sound effects. Peter Cushing must have felt a boy again, as a nutty professor whose shirt stays white as snow after the gentlemen has dragged himself through the slimy crap-holes of the Underworld. What a sport he was, to accept a part in this mishmash and carry it so bravely.Shot entirely on a sound stage and accompanied by then trendy, now unbearable synthesizer soundtrack, the main anti-attraction of this film are the cardboard monsters. Yes, there are always monsters like that in a Burroughs adaptation, but they rarely manage to be so completely ridiculous, helpless or void of any credibility. On a few occasions, during the elevated action-combat scenes where Mr McClure heroically attacks the creatures, you can almost hear the empty, hollow sound as his head bangs against the side of a triplodactocryptosaurus. Fortunately, the animals explode and go up in flames the minute they trip and fell over. Indeed, there is a great deal of unmotivated exploding as the film (and the genre) draws towards the finale. And lovely Miss Munroe loses her underworldly accent.The triple bill, currently on the market, features this film plus two others - The Land That Time Forgot and The War Lords Of Atlantis. The first two are quite strong entries, especially the first one, with a lot of money invested and occasionally even fascinating script turns. Don't expect any of these qualities from this film.

The central character John Reed (Beatty) and his wife Louise Bryant (Diane Keaton) aren't exactly sympathetic to the United States or Democracy at all and spend the majority of the film rallying support for Communism and instigating anti-Capitalist demonstrations. Given that the few bona-fide Capitalists that crop up in the story are penny pinching industrialists determined to bathe in the blood of the poor or cynical, defeatist losers, it's easy to understand why anyone brought up on apple-pie and patriotism will loathe it. However, it must be remembered that while Beatty clearly had a very strong message to promote with his pet project, this is ultimately a fictional and biased account of a real couple's lives. The best way to watch it, is to try and forget everything you know about Communism, Capitalism and the Russian Revolution altogether beforehand.As a simple entertainment piece then, the closest relative that Reds has is probably Gone With The Wind. It is a sprawling epic love story that takes place over several years and lasts longer than the actual Cold War which raises a wealth of sympathy for the love-lorn central characters in some truly moving scenes. Unfortunately, it suffers from the same over-indulgence as Gone With The Wind and in all honesty, the first hour of the film is completely unnecessary. Had it been trimmed down, it could have been far more enjoyable and a lot less tedious.The story opens with the meeting of John Reed and Louise Bryant in Portland Oregon. He is a disillusioned war journalist and she is a feminist painter stuck in a dead-end marriage. About four seconds after they meet they're locked together and doing the bad thing and their lives become intertwined immediately. The first hour of the film then consists of them moving round America, getting involved in the Socialist party and arguing non-stop. Watching this, you have to wonder exactly why they stay together as Louise spends her time either cheating on him with Jack Nicholson or storming off in a huff. It's incredibly frustrating to watch and the two are so unlikeable you have to wonder whether it's worth sitting through another two hours or simply turning it off and playing some X-Box games instead.And then, somewhere round the hour and ten minutes mark it begins to get interesting. With the horrors of war sweeping Europe into a frenzy, the pair travel to Russia where they witness first-hand the makings of the 1917 revolution. The story picks up significant pace and the pair suddenly become much more endearing as their love for one another develops against the backdrop of a country experiencing a severe social upheaval. Before the movie finishes a further hundred minutes later, the pair have returned to America, tried to form an American Communist party and met resentment and suspicion at every turn. John winds up trapped in the burgeoning Soviet Union and witnesses the party shortcomings and inner-turmoil first hand as Louise makes a desperate journey to reunite with him that'll make your heart ache.As you can probably tell therefore, it should have started an hour in as the first third is nowhere as good as the next two. That isn't to say it's all roses though as the political message is layered on rather thick and as such, a significant portion of the movie consists of John Reed making speeches about unions, manifestos, trade organisations, free enterprise and united workers. Beatty puts in a fine performance of course, but you don't half wish he'd shut up and stop trying to save the human race for five minutes. Keaton meanwhile ably matches him and puts in the role of her career, despite Louise not exactly being a sympathetic character for much of the running time.Its easy to see why the film is regarded as a classic and ignored by casual viewers at large though. It is way too long and the celebration of an American who hated his own country and everything it stood for is going to be a very bitter pill for a lot of the audience to swallow. Political activists and anti-Capitalist radicals will love it though but watching it in any other light just leaves the impression of a romance that goes on for far too long and suffers from its own self-importance.

It picks a more monster-horror approach, in which the 'monster' wants to kill everyone. Yes, it's true that in a way Alien wasn't much different, only difference was that in 1979 this approach was still new and original but not by 1992 standards anymore.Problem is that this movie is fairly standard and mostly predictable. Basically this movie isn't much different from most other genre movies, in which a monster is on the loose and on a killing-spree. In this movie you exactly know who is going to die and when. It also really kills the tension the movie. The only thing that makes the killings still good and interesting is the amount of gore used for it. The more 'monster' like approach of the alien also wasn't a good movie and it differs from the first two alien movies. The alien has a too prominent part in the movie and has way too much screen time. The mystery and horror of the character(s) in the first two movies was they the movie didn't showed them in many scene's, at least not fully. In the first two movies the alien was more presented as an animal, killing for their own survival. Not as a monster who kills for pleasure as in this movie is the case. This can be explained because of the reason that this alien in this movie is different from the aliens in the first two movies but this is not satisfying enough, considering that it is never explained in the movie why the alien acts and looks different.The movie went too various re-writes, even during filming and suffered heavily from the studio's- and producers influences. No wonder that David Fincher doesn't want to have anything to do with this movie. With other movies he definitely showed that he is capable of directing both atmospheric and tense movies (Se7en, The Game, Panic Room), so it's definitely not has fault that the movie failed. As a matter of fact, the visual style and atmosphere of the movie still make sure that this movie is a better than average one.There are some nice looking and claustrophobic sets featured in the movie. On the other hand the movie unfortunately felt the need to put in some computer effects and even though they of course look quite good for early '90's standards, it's terribly outdated and fake looking now.The movie is carried once more by Sigourney Weaver's performance. Ripley is such a great and strong female character. It also shows courage and dedication to the movies and character that Sigourney Weaver shaved her head bald for this movie. Too bad that none of the other characters really work out in this movie. They mostly remain flat and uninteresting. The movie does feature some interesting actors such as Charles Dance, Ralph Brown and Pete Postlethwaite but all of their talent is wasted in the script, in which they get very little interesting to do or say. The re-appearance of Bishop also feels more of an obligation than it serves a real purpose, though fans won't complain about it and neither would I really.

His personal project The Razor's Edge flopped with audiences and critics, and I think that must have been a blow to him. Besides making a cameo in the amusing Little Shop of Horrors, he stayed away from the Hollywood circuit for four years.But then in 1988 he resurfaced with Scrooged, an update on the classic Charles Dickens tale. Obviously trying to repeat the success of Ghostbusters, Scrooged was a modest hit with audiences, who considered it Murray's comeback role.When I was younger, I loved Scrooged. I thought it was funny and delivered on so many levels. But as I've gotten older, Scrooged has gone down considerably in my estimation. Instead of feeling funny, it now feels laboured, and forced. And I never thought I would say this, but the main reason Scrooged doesn't work is because of Bill Murray.Bill Murray is one of my favourite comedians. In fact I think he's one of the funniest men alive. His dry, laconic outlook on life is nearly always hilarious. Just look at some of the gems he's turned out. Ghostbusters. Groundhog Day. Lost in Translation and the sadly overlooked Broken Flowers.But then there's Scrooged. A film that should have been a perfect vehicle for Murray's talents, but it never even gets out of the gate. And I blame that on Murray, sadly. He did the theme of a miser seeing the error of his ways to much greater effect in the absolutely wonderful Groundhog Day, which is my personal favourite comedy of the 90s.In Scrooged, Murray is the borderline power-mad TV exec Frank Cross. A man so consumed by greed and hate he thinks nothing of firing employees if they even look at him the wrong way. Frank is on a dangerous path, and will lose everything if he doesn't change his ways. And so step in the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Future to show Frank what he's missed out on in life.There is some invention during the scenes of ghostly visitations. The Ghost of Christmas Past is a grizzled New York cab driver. The meter is actually a calender that shows the year Murray is in. The Ghost of Christmas Present (a horribly screechy performance by Carol Kane) is like an insane Sugar Plum Fairy with a nasty habit of punching Frank repeatedly. The Ghost of Christmas Future is just as Dickens left it. Except it has a TV for a face.Usually I like Christmas tales with dark centres, like the excellent Nightmare Before Christmas and the hilarious Gremlins. Two brilliant films that succeed on every level. But sadly, Scrooged doesn't deliver. Whenever Bill Murray is in a film, he's usually the best thing about it. Here he's the worst. He's clearly not having a good time. He approaches each scene with indifference. When he's hands on with material, he can deliver superb performances. But he's strictly hands off with this film. And as a result, it makes his supposed redemption in the final scenes that all the more false.There are occasions where his trademark sarcasm shines. I liked the scene where he collects an award for Humanitarian of the Year. Its funny because Murray is notorious for shunning the award ceremonies, and his clear distaste for the Oscars is mirrored in that scene. His acceptance speech is a marvellous send-up of the countless celebrities who stand up to the mike and drone on and on about their achievements.But elsewhere Scrooged falls flat. There is no evidence that Frank is slowly thawing. And because Murray overacts badly in this film (strange considering that he prefers minimalist acting), I couldn't believe for a second what I was seeing. Murray spends a lot of his time shouting his way through the film to the point that it becomes tedious.In the supporting cast, we do get some occasional rays of sunshine. John Glover is hilarious as the exec brought in to lighten the burden on Frank's shoulders, when really he's after his job. John Forsythe sports an astonishing makeup job as Frank's old boss, who appears as a decaying corpse, the film's version of Marley's Ghost. And the underrated Karen Allen shines as the woman Frank gave up for the sake of his career.But its in the final scenes where Scrooged comes crashing down. Frank has seen the error of his ways. And to prove it, he barges on to the set of a live retelling of A Christmas Carol the TV studio is putting on. Frank goes on and on (and on) about the true meaning of Christmas. And its a horrible thing to see. Murray doesn't sound like he believes a word of what he's saying. It seems to go on forever. And I felt really embarrassed for him.What a pity! Scrooged could have been a hip, witty deconstruction of A Christmas Carol. And nobody does nasty and sarcastic better than Bill Murray. Where did it all go wrong then? How did it so completely miss the mark? Shame considering it came from Richard Donner, the man behind classics like Superman and The Omen. And such a waste of Robert Mitchum and John Houseman.Very poor, and ultimately very depressing too.

His personal project The Razor's Edge flopped with audiences and critics, and I think that must have been a blow to him. Besides making a cameo in the amusing Little Shop of Horrors, he stayed away from the Hollywood circuit for four years.But then in 1988 he resurfaced with Scrooged, an update on the classic Charles Dickens tale. Obviously trying to repeat the success of Ghostbusters, Scrooged was a modest hit with audiences, who considered it Murray's comeback role.When I was younger, I loved Scrooged. I thought it was funny and delivered on so many levels. But as I've gotten older, Scrooged has gone down considerably in my estimation. Instead of feeling funny, it now feels laboured, and forced. And I never thought I would say this, but the main reason Scrooged doesn't work is because of Bill Murray.Bill Murray is one of my favourite comedians. In fact I think he's one of the funniest men alive. His dry, laconic outlook on life is nearly always hilarious. Just look at some of the gems he's turned out. Ghostbusters. Groundhog Day. Lost in Translation and the sadly overlooked Broken Flowers.But then there's Scrooged. A film that should have been a perfect vehicle for Murray's talents, but it never even gets out of the gate. And I blame that on Murray, sadly. He did the theme of a miser seeing the error of his ways to much greater effect in the absolutely wonderful Groundhog Day, which is my personal favourite comedy of the 90s.In Scrooged, Murray is the borderline power-mad TV exec Frank Cross. A man so consumed by greed and hate he thinks nothing of firing employees if they even look at him the wrong way. Frank is on a dangerous path, and will lose everything if he doesn't change his ways. And so step in the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Future to show Frank what he's missed out on in life.There is some invention during the scenes of ghostly visitations. The Ghost of Christmas Past is a grizzled New York cab driver. The meter is actually a calender that shows the year Murray is in. The Ghost of Christmas Present (a horribly screechy performance by Carol Kane) is like an insane Sugar Plum Fairy with a nasty habit of punching Frank repeatedly. The Ghost of Christmas Future is just as Dickens left it. Except it has a TV for a face.Usually I like Christmas tales with dark centres, like the excellent Nightmare Before Christmas and the hilarious Gremlins. Two brilliant films that succeed on every level. But sadly, Scrooged doesn't deliver. Whenever Bill Murray is in a film, he's usually the best thing about it. Here he's the worst. He's clearly not having a good time. He approaches each scene with indifference. When he's hands on with material, he can deliver superb performances. But he's strictly hands off with this film. And as a result, it makes his supposed redemption in the final scenes that all the more false.There are occasions where his trademark sarcasm shines. I liked the scene where he collects an award for Humanitarian of the Year. Its funny because Murray is notorious for shunning the award ceremonies, and his clear distaste for the Oscars is mirrored in that scene. His acceptance speech is a marvellous send-up of the countless celebrities who stand up to the mike and drone on and on about their achievements.But elsewhere Scrooged falls flat. There is no evidence that Frank is slowly thawing. And because Murray overacts badly in this film (strange considering that he prefers minimalist acting), I couldn't believe for a second what I was seeing. Murray spends a lot of his time shouting his way through the film to the point that it becomes tedious.In the supporting cast, we do get some occasional rays of sunshine. John Glover is hilarious as the exec brought in to lighten the burden on Frank's shoulders, when really he's after his job. John Forsythe sports an astonishing makeup job as Frank's old boss, who appears as a decaying corpse, the film's version of Marley's Ghost. And the underrated Karen Allen shines as the woman Frank gave up for the sake of his career.But its in the final scenes where Scrooged comes crashing down. Frank has seen the error of his ways. And to prove it, he barges on to the set of a live retelling of A Christmas Carol the TV studio is putting on. Frank goes on and on (and on) about the true meaning of Christmas.
