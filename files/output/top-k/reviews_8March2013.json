Like any good ball player, she remained on the team, pitching, catching and batting, sometimes in the minor leagues, but always giving it her best shot. Yes, Straight Jacket is schlock, but thanks to a truly sincere performance by Miss C., it rises above what it may have been had not such a big star stepped up to the plate to take on this part. Visually, Crawford looks silly as the be-wigged murderess who chopped of the heads of her much younger husband and his mistress, her masculine face defying anybody to believe that she's in her late 20's\/early 30's in the opening scenes. Crawford really worked hard to make her character someone interesting, instilling her with practically every emotional element that she could lay her hand on. Her bangled wife and mother who commits the murder is a trashier version of Stella Dallas; Her returning to public life has her as a shy, insecure woman afraid of facing strangers and being discovered for her shameful past. A child-like innocence comes out of her which has her appearing as if she is suffering from arrested development. Finally, she is a drunken floozy, throwing herself at her daughter's boyfriend without shame, caressing his face as if she was tenderizing a steak. Those moments are truly awkward to watch and indicate that even in spite of how everything turns out, she truly isn't recovered from her mental illness.As for Diane Baker as Crawford's troubled daughter, she is helped from the benefit of having worked with Crawford before (on 1959's The Best of Everything), their relationship as mother and daughter realistic as a result in spite of the young Carol having witnessed the horrors of her father's murder. The only issue is Baker's insistence that Crawford dress as she did 20 years before. The wardrobe and wig she wears is definitely low-class considering that Carol is engaged to a member of the upper class. Crawford actually looks better with the mousy brown hair and more sensible outfits, minus those cowbells she wears on her wrists. But Baker is credible in the role, showing both love and resentment towards her mother whose actions have obviously left her scarred.A young George Kennedy plays the sleazy farm hand who appropriately appears disheveled while working with the pigs. The beheading scenes are extremely silly looking, and the apparent nightmares and voices that Crawford hears are delightfully silly, the conclusion obvious. When Mommie Dearest utilized a scene with Faye Dunaway swinging an axe, I'm sure many of Crawford's fans thought of this film and had a good laugh at both film's expenses.

Filled with great direction,one of the best casts in film history and a excellent score, this is one of my favorite movies and is one of Coppola's best films.Based on S.E Hinton's novel of the same name and set in Tulsa,Oklahoma in 1965,The Outsiders tells the story about a group of Greasers,poor,working class kids who are fighting to protect their turf from The Socs,a bunch of rich kids who beat up and terrorize Greasers. Among The Greasers is a young man named Ponyboy Curtis(C.Thomas Howell)who while hanging with his best friend Johnny Cade(Ralph Macchio)are attacked by The Socs. When Johnny kills one of The Socs,Ponyboy and Johnny confide with their friend and fellow Greaser Dallas Winston(Matt Dillon). After the murder,a set of tragic events happen building up to a big rumble between The Greasers and The Socs.One of The reasons The Outsiders is a great film is because of the way Francis Coppola approaches the material. Adapting a beloved,classic book is never easy,but Coppola adapts S.E Hinton's classic so easily and does it without a hitch. Coppola has always said that this was an epic for teens or a Gone With The Wind for teenagers and while Coppola doesn't match the epic quality of Gone With The Wind in terms of length or story,it's like GWTW in terms of scope and style. The film takes the civil war concept of GWTW and instead of North vs South,it's Greasers vs Socs,giving viewers a harsh reality where Greasers are constantly being attacked by Socs and always have to defend themselves. It's a civil war in the mid-1960's with switchblades instead of guns. The film is also epic in terms of it's beautiful widescreen cinematography by Stephen H.Burum. Burum's cinematography is stylish and unforgettable and reminds viewers of classic Hollywood films like Rebel Without A Cause,East Of Eden and West Side Story using colors like orange,gold and blue giving the film a great atmosphere. Some shots are also similar to Gone With The Wind with shots of the sunrise and sunset with beautiful gold and orange scenery. The Outsiders is gorgeous to look at. The Greasers in the film like Ponyboy and his friends are just regular teens and young adults trying to find their way in the world and while they're in gangs and into rumbles they're likable people. I think what Coppola's film and Hinton's novel was trying to say was that there was a world outside of gangs,Greasers,Socs and rumbles,where Ponyboy and his friends can rise above being a greaser and labels,because while Ponyboy and his friends are into gang activity they're not criminals thugs or troublemakers. The Outsiders is one of the most faithful book to movie translations I have ever seen,pretty much most of the scenes and dialog are lifted right from the book with a few alterations. You can read the book or watch the film at the same time and see for yourself. The ending of the film is sad,but at the same time hopeful and will stay with you and makes the film and book a timeless classic. While I love the theatrical version of the film,I also liked the complete novel extended director's cut of the film with some scenes that were deleted from the final film. We get more scenes with Ponyboy and his older brothers and also other scenes that were from the book that enhance the plot in the film. But if there is one problem I have with the director's cut of the film it's exclusion of Carmine Coppola's score which has been taken out completely. I love Carmine Coppola's score for the film and for me the score is one of the things I love about The Outsiders and watch the film without the score is eating one of your favorite foods with a missing ingredient. A film score is something that can make or break a film and Carmine's score is one of the things that makes the film. Francis Coppola should not have had the original score taken out. Other than that I liked the Complete novel version.The whole cast does an amazing job in their roles. C.Thomas Howell is excellent in his career defining role as Ponyboy Curtis,with Howell bringing depth,sadness and intensity to the role. Matt Dillon is brilliant as Dallas Winston,a greaser who is tough,but cares about his fellow Greasers. Ralph Macchio is terrific as Johnny Cade,an abused kid who is Ponyboy's best friend. Patrick Swayze and Rob Lowe give great performances as Darrell and Sodapop Curtis,Ponyboy's older brothers. Emilio Estevez is wonderful as Two-Bit Matthews,with Estevez bringing humor to the role. Tom Cruise gives a fine performance as Steve Randle,Sodapop's best friend. Who would have known Cruise would be a big star. Diane Lane gives a great performance and is beautiful as Cherry Valance,a Soc that befriends Ponyboy. Leif Garrett is good as Bob,a Soc who's Cherry's boyfriend. Glenn Withrow(Tim Shepard),Darren Dalton(Randy),Michelle Meyrink(Marcia),Tom Waits(Buck),Gailard Sartain(Jerry) and William Smith(Store Clerk)give good performances as well. This film had one best casts in movie history.The direction Francis Coppola is excellent,with Coppola bringing a beautiful visual style and great camera angles giving the film a great atmosphere. Great direction by Coppola.The score by Carmine Coppola is excellent,epic and beautiful and fits in with the film's visuals and tone. It's a great score that Francis should not have taken out. I also loved the classic Stevie Wonder song Stay Gold which is beautiful and memorable. There's also a great use of the Van Morrison classic Gloria.In final word,if you love Teen films,Coming Of Age films,Gang films,films in general,Francis Coppola and S.E Hinton I suggest you see The Outsiders,an absolute classic that will stay with you forever.

It's one of those movies, which in it's start, immediately leaves you wondering what's going on, and what's to ensue, when a lone car comes speeding down a rain swept city street. A great night shot. I love those movies. When a very clever psychotic, (Clancy Brown, always reliable as a good performer) escapes hot shot FBI cop profiler, Poitier (marking a solid comeback) and his men after a negotiation, goes to s..t, he makes it his personal, mission to capture this madman, who have two aged hostages plus a maid and heir dog. The killer has taken off with these diamonds, so guilt stricken Poitier needs a guide, loner Berenger, the wilderness, his really own karmic environment. Berenger, not a real people person, who too could use a shower or too, is loathe at first to take Poitier, but really he has no choice. And with his survival skills in the great outdoors lacking here, our inept Poitier becomes the pain in Berenger's arse. Poitier's ineptness is what's funny too, some scenes, involving a horse. But too, Berenger's short fuse, adds more laughs, especially in one scene, involving a stubborn Poitier. Berenger's love (Kirsty Alley) Sarah, is leading a party of men on a hunting expedition, one man escaping the hell of a divorce, another one being the jewel stealing psycho. When too in a chinwag, Brown, keeps asking another of his fellow party, some questions, as if to maintain his guise of normalcy, where if this guy was among you, you wouldn't think for a second, he's weird or dangerous. But these stone cold psycho's are so good at pulling off their act of Mr good and wholesome, they themselves deserve an Oscar. Soon the other men of party are all killed, some of them falling into the river, one of them told by Brown, that he's a cop, before this poor explorer buys it. Now we have a cosey scene with just Brown and Sarah, which is really an inhospitable one. Sarah is a fighter and has an independence about her. She has balls too, as when offered one of the diamonds, she throws it in the river. The film is in the adventure, where Berenger and Poitier, tackle obstacles, one big one, trying to cross a ravine, from one cliff to another where it's means was tampered with, so our two have to do it the hard way using their own ropes and pegs. They encounter a bit of a hiccup, and Berenger goes flying hard against the face of a big rock, (I can still feel it and hear that slap) then manages to climb back up, which really got me exhausted as it did our actors. Another thrilling scene has them chased by a big grizzly, and you'll love how this situation is dealt with. I also loved it when the blizzard hit, that had me thinking, Are these two scenes part of the same environment. They dig a burrow furiously, under the snow, amidst the wild blizzard. Poitier is so cold that Berenger has to warm him up. Another funny moment. The next day, a fist punches through the snow, where we have a warmish sun of relief. Then we near towards a climax with some things I couldn't buy. 1. Like how they just happened to track Alley and co down when coming onto a mountain road. And 2. Just outside the police station, how they happened to overhear a report that leads to a location, where Alley and her captor were. The climax was powerful, I must say, where it's great to see our Sidney back in action. But despite some flaws, Deadly Pursuit is a good 88' movie I've viewed many times, with beautiful outdoorsy locations, that almost makes you want to take up, being an explorer. But if part of a troupe, you certainly wouldn't want to be in one, killer Brown is part of.

And with his survival skills in the great outdoors lacking here, our inept Poitier becomes the pain in Berenger's arse. Poitier's ineptness is what's funny too, some scenes, involving a horse. But too, Berenger's short fuse, adds more laughs, especially in one scene, involving a stubborn Poitier. Berenger's love (Kirsty Alley) Sarah, is leading a party of men on a hunting expedition, one man escaping the hell of a divorce, another one being the jewel stealing psycho. When too in a chinwag, Brown, keeps asking another of his fellow party, some questions, as if to maintain his guise of normalcy, where if this guy was among you, you wouldn't think for a second, he's weird or dangerous. But these stone cold psycho's are so good at pulling off their act of Mr good and wholesome, they themselves deserve an Oscar. Soon the other men of party are all killed, some of them falling into the river, one of them told by Brown, that he's a cop, before this poor explorer buys it. Now we have a cosey scene with just Brown and Sarah, which is really an inhospitable one. Sarah is a fighter and has an independence about her. She has balls too, as when offered one of the diamonds, she throws it in the river. The film is in the adventure, where Berenger and Poitier, tackle obstacles, one big one, trying to cross a ravine, from one cliff to another where it's means was tampered with, so our two have to do it the hard way using their own ropes and pegs. They encounter a bit of a hiccup, and Berenger goes flying hard against the face of a big rock, (I can still feel it and hear that slap) then manages to climb back up, which really got me exhausted as it did our actors. Another thrilling scene has them chased by a big grizzly, and you'll love how this situation is dealt with. I also loved it when the blizzard hit, that had me thinking, Are these two scenes part of the same environment. They dig a burrow furiously, under the snow, amidst the wild blizzard. Poitier is so cold that Berenger has to warm him up. Another funny moment. The next day, a fist punches through the snow, where we have a warmish sun of relief. Then we near towards a climax with some things I couldn't buy. 1. Like how they just happened to track Alley and co down when coming onto a mountain road. And 2. Just outside the police station, how they happened to overhear a report that leads to a location, where Alley and her captor were. The climax was powerful, I must say, where it's great to see our Sidney back in action. But despite some flaws, Deadly Pursuit is a good 88' movie I've viewed many times, with beautiful outdoorsy locations, that almost makes you want to take up, being an explorer. But if part of a troupe, you certainly wouldn't want to be in one, killer Brown is part of.

It's one of those movies, which in it's start, immediately leaves you wondering what's going on, and what's to ensue, when a lone car comes speeding down a rain swept city street. A great night shot. I love those movies. When a very clever psychotic, (Clancy Brown, always reliable as a good performer) escapes hot shot FBI cop profiler, Poitier (marking a solid comeback) and his men after a negotiation, goes to s..t, he makes it his personal, mission to capture this madman, who have two aged hostages plus a maid and heir dog.

It's supposed to be the best film ever made according to the most prestigious poll in the world, for decades in a row, only recently being surpassed by Vertigo. It seems to me that there are potentially two major factors related to this fact, that might bias and distort our judgment of the film itself, our naked experience of it so to speak. The first one is the most obvious either a fear of being excluded from the cinema in-crowd, or otherwise just being overwhelmed by all those respectable opinions of all those respectable critics who surely must know what they're talking about, or just plain unintelligent herd-mentality, might cause you to think that this film is much better than it actually is. There is also a less obvious possibility the fact that this film is so highly revered might cause you to think that you are only bullied into thinking that it is so great, and that you start to think that the only way of preserving your authenticity is to denounce it or to greet it with a lukewarm response. Personally, I know I'm susceptible to both distortions, both based upon the a priori fact of 'Kane' being canonized as it is. A fact that, in these cases of distortion, will determine your opinion of the film, regardless of whether or not you have actually seen it. A fact that may very well blind you completely to die Sache selbst. I think that a phenomenological reduction is in order here. A commitment to completely shut out the knowledge of Kane having the reputation that it has, while watching it. Only then are you perhaps able to actually see the film, let alone judge it. But this is no easy task. In fact it is an impossible task. Therefore, it would seem to follow that it is impossible to watch it. That may be true strictly speaking, but of course not all things are as black and white as the film itself. It is all a matter of degree and a matter of at least trying, or perhaps not of trying, but of letting go, much like 'trying' to sleep cannot be successful when it is literally a matter of trying. But if that is what you shouldn't do, then what should you do? I think that you should let yourself be immersed by the film, let it touch you if it gives itself to you and let it fail to touch you if it tries too hard, if it pulls on your heart like it were only a puppet on a string. All in all, it is your heart that provides you with the most reliable compass. That is not to say that your heart should be opposed to your mind and that if it would 'merely' blow your mind it wouldn't be good enough. Again, things aren't as black and white.But enough about all the preparations. To the film itself! Was I touched by the film? Yes I was. In fact at times I was touched deeply by it, more than I remembered from the last time. Especially by some of the scenes with Kane's wife in the opera house and the scenes in Xanadu, where the true nature of their relationship was revealed. But is Kane a manipulative film? Yes it is. I think that Orson Welles perhaps suffered from many of the same faults as Kane himself, like Leland said You don't care about anything except you. You just want to persuade people that you love 'em so much that they ought to love you back. Only you want love on your own terms. Something to be played your way, according to your rules. Citizen Kane is a film that self-consciously wants to be loved. No, it demands to be loved, to be taken before anything else. Very, very hard work went into the making of it to ensure this. It avoids extremities and one-sidedness so as not to exclude any viewers. It includes beautiful and innovative shots in order to appeal to critics and formalist, but mostly not so obvious as to become elitist. It tries to be deep, profound and mysterious and takes itself dead-serious. There was one scene that didn't touch me as much this time, even if it did before, and that was the Rosebud scene at the beginning it was so intensely self-serious that for a fraction of a second it went over the top for me and became almost comical, like a self-parody (and the fake mustache didn't really help there). But mostly the film is absolutely perfect in terms of editing, narrative and dramatic development, composition, cinematography and an undefinable feel of greatness and precision permeating almost every shot that can only be the product of extremely hard labor and loads of talent. There were also less than perfect qualities, such as the somewhat slower development of the middle part, the acting that varied from great to constructed, even from Welles himself. Also the atmosphere is strange mostly the film smells like newspapers, money and power-grabbing. Of course that is what the film is about, but as an atmosphere that is normally not really a virtue. Still, this dry and somewhat suffocating atmosphere becomes part of the tragedy of the film, just like the fact that the film is just as manipulative as Citizen Kane himself, becomes part of that tragedy and actually deepens it. Just by not succeeding to create a beautiful atmosphere, the film tragically makes us wish to be released from it and makes us yearn for something lost. Just by the fact that it tries to manipulate us, tries to pull our strings too hard, and fails to touch our hearts because of it, the film becomes the very deadness and emptiness that sends chills down our spine, from the top of our heads, straight to our hearts. 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"8 March 2013","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" How to watch a movie like Citizen Kane?

Pulp Fiction is so much more than a movie and back in its release year, there had never really been a movie like 'Pulp Fiction' apart from perhaps Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece that was his directorial debut 'Reservoir Dogs' To describe 'Pulp Fiction' is like truly describing why you love chocolate. The plot to the movie is not easy to explain but simplistic to watch and understand. Apart from such stylistic choices made by Quentin Tarantino that involves using music that adds to the tone of the movie, Quentin Tarantino's writing is far superior to any director working today. The dialogue in 'Pulp Fiction' is what I believe to be the greatest dialogue in cinematic history. It is easy for anyone to say, Wow! I could do that. It isn't hard! but really&#x85;No man on Earth could use such entertaining dialogue in what is basically a dialogue based movie. There was not a minute of dialogue that bored me in the morning. The dialogue was harsh, it was hilarious, it was brutal, it was classical and yet, it was so clever. 'Pulp Fiction', turning 18 years old this year still has people that love this movie and even to this day, people repeat quotes from the movie. That's how catchy the dialogue is. The story is that based around two mob men who come across a hard day whilst trying to deliver something to his boss, a boxer whose life becomes at stake after a boxing match, a story of the mob leader, a story where one of the two mob men must take out the gangster's wife on a date and a story based around the opening scene, which is the restaurant robbery. Pulp Fiction is NOT an action movie nor is it a comedy. It has elements of both but Tarantino is a master at blending elements from certain movies he particularly loves. The characters in this movie are all fantastic, with one of my favourite characters being the Wolf! I just love that guy and Harvey Keitel really is amazing in that role. However, without a doubt the scene stealer in the movie is Samuel L Jackson as the amazing Jules Winnfield who steals the last 30-45 minutes of the movie. Seriously, that part 'The Bonnie Situation' feels like a 10 minute scene. That isn't to say the rest of the acting is mediocre. That's just harsh. John Travolta as Jackson's sidekick in this movie is superb and is the other scene stealer, Bruce Willis as Butch is brilliant, Uma Thurman as Mia Wallace is surprisingly perfect, Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer as the restaurant robbers are great as is every single member of the cast including director Quentin Tarantino in his cameo. The movie, at a run time of 150 minutes (2 ½ hours) did not at any moment bore me which is amazing considering that I must pause the film at a time to look at how much I've seen.

Pulp Fiction is so much more than a movie and back in its release year, there had never really been a movie like 'Pulp Fiction' apart from perhaps Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece that was his directorial debut 'Reservoir Dogs' To describe 'Pulp Fiction' is like truly describing why you love chocolate. The plot to the movie is not easy to explain but simplistic to watch and understand. Apart from such stylistic choices made by Quentin Tarantino that involves using music that adds to the tone of the movie, Quentin Tarantino's writing is far superior to any director working today. The dialogue in 'Pulp Fiction' is what I believe to be the greatest dialogue in cinematic history. It is easy for anyone to say, Wow! I could do that. It isn't hard! but really&#x85;No man on Earth could use such entertaining dialogue in what is basically a dialogue based movie. There was not a minute of dialogue that bored me in the morning. The dialogue was harsh, it was hilarious, it was brutal, it was classical and yet, it was so clever. 'Pulp Fiction', turning 18 years old this year still has people that love this movie and even to this day, people repeat quotes from the movie. That's how catchy the dialogue is. The story is that based around two mob men who come across a hard day whilst trying to deliver something to his boss, a boxer whose life becomes at stake after a boxing match, a story of the mob leader, a story where one of the two mob men must take out the gangster's wife on a date and a story based around the opening scene, which is the restaurant robbery. Pulp Fiction is NOT an action movie nor is it a comedy. It has elements of both but Tarantino is a master at blending elements from certain movies he particularly loves. The characters in this movie are all fantastic, with one of my favourite characters being the Wolf! I just love that guy and Harvey Keitel really is amazing in that role. However, without a doubt the scene stealer in the movie is Samuel L Jackson as the amazing Jules Winnfield who steals the last 30-45 minutes of the movie. Seriously, that part 'The Bonnie Situation' feels like a 10 minute scene. That isn't to say the rest of the acting is mediocre. That's just harsh. John Travolta as Jackson's sidekick in this movie is superb and is the other scene stealer, Bruce Willis as Butch is brilliant, Uma Thurman as Mia Wallace is surprisingly perfect, Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer as the restaurant robbers are great as is every single member of the cast including director Quentin Tarantino in his cameo. The movie, at a run time of 150 minutes (2 ½ hours) did not at any moment bore me which is amazing considering that I must pause the film at a time to look at how much I've seen.

In Earth, Clark begins to figure out his mysterious power which he decides to use for the good of his city.First of all, I'll start off with what I love about this movie and that is the first 45 minutes of the movie which deals with the origin of Clark Kent back in his home planet, to his arrival on Earth, to being adopted to the point where he witnesses his father die and to the point where he leaves his mother. This is to me, the highlight of the movie and here's why This here is where I was emotionally connected with the film the most. The acting here was definitely the best. Despite such minor performance, and such little screen time, Marlon Brando is easily the star of the movie in his 15 minute role as Jor-El. However, the supporting cast do a great job mainly Gene Hackman and Christopher Reve. Margot Kidder as Loius was at times, not very effective and a little laughable but is forgotten by great acting from the supporting cast.It is fair to say the dialogue is cheesy, the effects are heavily outdated, especially such environments which look like they've been drawn. I mean the original 'Star Wars' aged far better and it contains more visuals. The action type sequences in the movie are no longer that impressive but the biggest issue with the movie is, its rushed conclusion as it spends a good deal of just under one hour before the plot begins to move away from Clark's origin.Another thing I find laughable is how Loius actually finds out that Clark is Superman. I mean, its a little strange that no other person who has stayed with Clark for a certain time period couldn't figure it out. As a character, I didn't enjoy her much.Apart from Brando's amazing portrayal...as expected, the second in highlight for this movie is John Williams' amazing musical score which propelled the movie forward in its extremely long 5 minute opening credits sequence. This sequence did not bore me due to the amazing score.'Superman' is a classic superhero tale that was revolutionary for its time and loved back then...and even still now...but there is no denying that the effects in this movie, despite coming out an year after the original 'Star Wars' are far more outdated and poor to look at.

It's not just that it's a bad film, because there are plenty of bad movies that are overrated for perfectly understandable reasons. But there's very little to grab onto here. It's a dull movie, with the drama and comedy being equally half-hearted, leaving us just watching a pleasant but not particularly interesting series of events. The direction is inept, and the performances are solid (excepting Dan Ackroyd's terrible southern accent) but don't have much to work with. The critical and commercial success of the film and the play it's based on would then seem to be a mountainous testament to America's willingness to hear a racial fairy tale.Morgan Freeman, as Hoke Colburn, represents the kind of racial integration everyone can get behind. He's an old, cuddly black man whose rebellion against racism is never fiercer than an angry mutter under the breast and is usually the picture of folksy wisdom and compliance. What's more, the film gallingly presents the struggle for equality as Hoke's struggle to serve Daisy, and her acceptance of his service to her as an overcoming of prejudice. By this logic the antebellum south was a hotbed of anti-racism. It is, however, very comforting to the white movie-goer, who can now beam at their own acceptance as they take their popcorn from the black woman working for minimum wage behind the counter.Driving Miss Daisy meanders from one year to the next, stopping on plots briefly and occasionally finding affecting material but never really having the focus to explore it. The makeup is perhaps the only thing done well here, ageing its characters two decades in a way that seems absolutely natural. In the end, while Driving Miss Daisy was only made in 1989, I've seen films from 1929 that seem fresher and less dated. The sepia-toned nursing-home cinematography accounts for a lot of that, but I'd like to imagine that its glib presentation of race is also part of why it seems so jarring to a contemporary viewer.

Kubrick has excellent insight into the twisted nature of humanity, and does an amazing job exposing it in this film. Malcolm McDowell plays his role amazingly too. I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone who likes to see movies which are meant to be twisted. You need a strong stomach to see this film, just be warned! Don't forget Kubrick is also the one who filmed and directed 2001, and it should be watched in just as much grandeur as this film. What was considered modernist in design in the late 1960s, the design of the sets, clothing, and overall feeling of the film should be taken as something out of this world, and a commentary on human nature. Enjoy the film and take it in as commentary, and critical analysis of how evil people can be to one another, and to everyone they encounter.

He took his secondary characters, wrapped up a number of loose ends, stirred it all together, stripped all the smart dialogs from the resulting mix, and made a script out of it. You can still find a number of social commentary aimed at Hollywood in it, but the just of the flick aims at turning off your brain.The best joke of the bunch is making the fake film into a a sort of Star Wars parody and have Mark Hamill play the villain. I will also mention that Carrie Fisher has a small role in there somewhere, just to make the whole thing even more meta. Actually, Smith makes the whole thing so meta that he has to laugh at himself by making the actors look pointedly at the camera.This production is star studded with the likes of Wes Craven, Shannen Doherty, Jason Biggs, James Van Der Beek, Gus Van Sant, and that's just naming a few.If you like what Kevin Smith does, and know his universe, you will appreciate it.

This is another solid effort from him and Universal-International; it's intelligent, it's spooky, and it builds to a very big finish.The likable John Agar stars as Matt Hastings, a doctor in the small town of Desert Rock who discovers that the scientific experiments conducted by Gerald Deemer (Leo G. Carroll) have had devastating consequences. Out of the best of intentions, Deemer and his associates have been fooling with a growth formula intended for use in helping a world with too many people and not enough food. The result is a tarantula that grows to MANY times its normal size, and terrorizes the California desert and chows down on any unlucky human (or animal) that it finds.Films such as Tarantula may not be for all tastes. Admittedly, it doesn't have that much great tarantula action, but the screenplay, by Robert M. Fresco and Martin Berkeley (based on a story by Arnold and Fresco) is sharp enough, interesting enough, and sometimes amusing enough, to just draw the viewer right in. Arnold parcels the thrills out carefully, tantalizing us a bit at a time until the climax when the enormous tarantula is about to reach Desert Rock and the frantic humans are trying to figure out how to destroy it. One of the most intriguing aspects to the screenplay is the effect that the formula has on human beings.The visual effects are quite good for this sort of thing, but the makeup by Bud Westmore is no less noteworthy. The cinematography by George Robinson is first rate as is the rousing music score by Herman Stein. The acting is extremely engaging from all concerned, with Mara Corday both lovely and appealing as the leading lady who's got brains to match her beauty. The under-rated Carroll is one of those actors to whom you want to listen when he speaks; he carries that kind of authority. Nestor Paiva has an irresistible presence as the jovial sheriff. And be sure to wait for the brief appearance by a certain gravelly voiced, squinty eyed movie legend, in one of his earliest feature film roles.This is just plain fun, and worth watching if you, like this viewer, are a big fan of the many genre productions of the 1950s.Eight out of 10.
