However, out of sheer boredom perhaps, I finally consented to the pleas of my friends and paid the eight Dollars to attend. Little did I know that what awaited me in that darkened room was worse than anything I could ever imagine. In case you've been asleep for 2 years, Titanic, directed by James Cameron, mildly resembles a love story that supposedly took place upon that ill-fated oceanliner, the Titanic. The premise for the film is typical. Guy meets Girl. Girl is from higher social class and will not succumb to Guy's advances. Finally, after much personal anguish and deep thought, she gives in to the overwhelming emotion, and together they fight the oppressive opinions of the people around them. It is by no means an original story line. We have all seen this numerous times before with alternate settings. What actually happens in Titanic's three agonizing hours, against the backdrop of that historical tragedy, is the most ridiculous waste of money I have ever been victim to. The characters in the story were, in a word, ridiculous. I sat back watching in disbelief as the one-dimensional personalities produced tears in my fellow viewers. Leonardo DiCaprio, that pre-pubescent heartthrob of seventh graders everywhere, took on the role of the Good Guy. Similarly, there were others to fit the roles of Good Girl, and of course, Bad Guy, all of whom overacted to an embarrassing extent. With the aid of the outrageously simple dialogue, the star cast acted not unlike an elementary school drama ensemble. I sat through this film in a constant state of pain as the film gradually deteriorated. It has to get better, I thought to myself, dodging the wet tissues that were being passed through the audience. Titanic, unfortunately, did not get better. Despite the film's numerous attempts at evoking emotion, Mr. DiCaprio's nauseating performance and Ms. Winslet's complete lack of talent were the only things that managed to raise goosebumps on my arms. Riding the bus on the way home, I again tried to find any salvation for the film. I temporarily consoled myself with thoughts of the technical aspects. The special effects involving the sinking of the ship were mildly amusing. However, that too was quickly obliterated when I realized that most of the effects had been created using miniatures and an over-sized bathtub. I continue to hear people rant and rave about how great Titanic was, only confirming my suspicion that the majority of the North American population are, like the film's heroes, shallow and easily amused. Furthermore, I was sickened as I recalled the numerous Oscars that were handed out to the man responsible for this disaster, Mr. James Cameron. Many are convinced that he is a wonderful human being. After all, he refused to accept a salary for his work. I believe that he did this out of shame rather than personal sacrifice. Naturally, the fame and recognition he received as a result of this film makes all his future endeavors instant hits. I cringe at the thought. Everyone behind the release of Titanic should retire immediately as it is an insult to the art of filmmaking and to filmgoers throughout the world. Titanic, its cast, and the billions of Dollars wasted on its production need to be studied very carefully. Scholars everywhere need to forever use it as an example of how to make a film void of interest, originality, and self-respect.

The problem here is not the film per-se, it's the fact that he tries to pass it to us as REALITY the supreme truth about WWII. In fact, not only there are many visible historical and strategic inaccuracies, but most importantly, the human interaction is injected with familiar Spilbergian fakeness I couldn't help noticing. The dialogue, aside from a couple of obligatory f-words and a few explicit sexual references, feels at least fifty years old, when the Hollywood Character Actors went about delivering grand, all-important speeches, and witty , crowd-pleasing lines. Sorry, Steven, but if you wanted to keep it real, you should've cut down on melodramatics or better yet, hired a different screenwriter. The soldiers suffer from a lack of character development, and remain nothing but polished stereotypes, their emotional responses not always justified. However, THE reason to view this film is the two Battle Scenes, enveloping the story, (much like in the Wild Bunch). Only here, instead of using Peckinpah's now-cliched slow motion violence, the scenes are shot in real-time, or even speeded up slightly to an amazing effect. John Williams, thank god, quiets down for the duration of both scenes and lets us listen to the actual sounds of war without any musical interference. The first scene, the Storming of Omaha Beach, is so tension-packed, exciting and stimultaneously terrifying, that it could well be the best of its kind.

The story is more complex than Mission Impossible, and once you get it, you are really glad and you really enjoy it. It's not as violent as people say it is, no more bloodshed than Die Hard and T2. It starts off as a futuristic Action\/Thriller, then after two hours you are seeing it as an epic Sci-Fi\/Adventure.  Schwarzenegger really helps the film with his non-relaxed, confused performance. His corny one-liners however do not help the film. I don't see how this could produce a sequel, but I hope they do make one and Paul Verhoeven helms once more.

I spent the film thinking alternately what a waste, what an idiot and what a lucky idiot, as he miraculously escapes serious harm. Ari possesses a ferocious libido and has a penchant for anonymous gay sex (Hard On might have been a better title). He still connects with his family, more or less, though his father regards him as a dropout. Mum is more forgiving. His friends seem to see him as one of the lads, gambling and dancing the hours away.The film is a kaleidoscope of images, often distorted as the drugs take hold, moving at a cracking pace. Never was self-destruction made to look so easy. The reasons for it are harder to fathom. Sure, the kid's parents are migrants. They haven't done well, but they've survived and brought up two more or less normal other kids. Sure, Ari's still in the Greek ghetto but the walls between it and the outside are low. Sure, drugs are everywhere, but he's really just a recreational user. So why the angst? Back to Greece maybe? Now then there would be stress.Alex Dimitriadis is stunning as Ari and there is a particularly nice performance by Paul Capsis as his mate Johnnie the transvestite. There is plenty of youthful energy in the making of the film as well as the acting and even a jaded old critic like this one eagerly awaits the team's next effort. But what on earth was driving Ari? Eros or Thanatos? Maybe you have to be Greek to understand.

It deals with the true, raw passion that two people in love (soul-mates in particular) go through in both happy and trying times.  It conveys the true meaning of eternal love. The characterization of the Nielsen's is entirely three dimensional and totally realistic-Chris loves his family, he's hard on his children but remorseful about that; he also loves being a doctor and is incredibly caring and gentle with his patients as well as his family for the most part; stubborn; and of course, he is incredibly attuned to and in love with his wife.  Annabella Sciorra, as always, is beautiful in the film, both as a young woman full of light and hope and older when she is depressed and angry, though always loving her husband and her children.The film adequately depicts my conceptions of what Heaven and Hell will be like.  The vibrant colors in Heaven aren't gaudy or splashy but absolutely beautiful.  I would buy every single still in those scenes as a piece of art complete unto itself.  Absolutely beautiful, and it looks completely real, amazingly enough.  Hell is not the Hell I've seen in other films, but more like my conception, as I've said.  Dark, dismal, sad, depressing, and scary, but not any scarier than what Annie was going through on Earth, except that it was eternal. It showed what people remember in vivid detail is not always memories the people in those memories will have, but if you love each other then your love can transcend any bounds, physical or spiritual, and that if you're good, people will love, remember, and cherish you as much as you loved, remembered, and cherished them. The only criticism I have of the film is that it cut a little too close to home.

What really blew the movie is that Drew Barrymore (really bad this time) and Adam Sandler get to marry each other. After a few minutes you could predict that. Why is there a rule for a romantic comedy calling in the end there has to be a mariage? Is living together not good enough anymore? No more marriages please or I can't stand romantic comedy's anymore.
