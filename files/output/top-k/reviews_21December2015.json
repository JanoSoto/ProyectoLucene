[{"date":"21 December 2015","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Shrek, More Like KekI just saw the movie Shek and I wanted to write a review, so here I am...the movie was such a craaaaaaaaaaaazzzzzyyyyyy journey, from the swamps to the cops chasing the protagonist Shork through in a castle far far away. The antagonist Lord Fartcod, is a male with a maximum height of 3'4 and a swaggy horse named Kooky, to counter Shork's sloth Donker, who is obsessed with corn dogs. I own the movie on the special VCR collector's edition that has Leonardo DiCaprio playing the part of Gingivitis, the gingerbread man, I think this is a very nice edition...however the part of the three blind mice was played by Macaulay Culkin which I think was a very bad idea, but that can be forgiven by Seth Rogen's role as Kooky. My favorite part of Shek is probably the part were (spoiler) Donker is walking on a bridge over lava and he falls but is saved last minute, by Kooky's cousin Gorby....Donker and Gorby realize their love and stick together. The musical score by the band The Spice Girls, with the main theme song of the movie being Wannabe (Shek's lover). Overall I think Shek is a fantas-tickle movie being the best movie of the CENTURY...11 out of 10.
