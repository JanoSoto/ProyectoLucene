[{"date":"4 July 2009","score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Egyptian Mummies doubtlessly range among the most fascinating Horror creatures, and yet their overall representation in cinema seems a bit weak, compared to that of other ghoulish fiends. This is not due to the lack of mummy films, but to due to the small number of truly imaginative ones. Of all mummy films I've seen, there is only one that is truly fantastic - The Mummy of 1932. And what a masterpiece it is! Karl Feund's brilliant milestone is not merely the greatest Mummy picture of all-time, and one of the greatest of the Universal Horror classics; it is doubtlessly one of the greatest Horror films ever made. Horror-deity Boris Karloff gives one of the most astonishing performances of his outstanding career, in one of the Horror genre's most immortal roles - Imhotep. As Karloff's most famous role, Frankenstein's Monster, Imhotep is a tragic character, though incomparably more evil than the predominantly woeful Monster. Though an incredibly haunting fiend, Imhotep is driven by immortal love to a woman. In 1922 an archaeologist awakens the mummy of the Egyptian priest Imhotep by reading out a spell on an ancient scroll. The mummy disappears, but returns ten years later, disguised as Ardath Bey in search of his love - an immortal love which lasted thousands of years. Imhotep was mummified alive for committing the sacrilege of trying to awake his beloved, a priestess of Isis and daughter of the Pharaoh, from the dead. In the 20th century, beautiful young Helen (Zita Johann) is the spitting image of the Egyptian priestess...Imhotep is doubtlessly one of the most haunting and memorable villains the Horror genre has ever seen, and Karloff, doubtlessly one of the greatest actors who ever lived, is brilliant in the role. No one could possibly doubt that Karloff was one of the greatest icons ever in cinema, and this role is arguably his greatest besides that of Frankenstein's Monnster in James Whale's Frankenstein (1932) and the even greater sequel Bride of Frankenstein (1935). Karloff looks incredibly creepy, both as the mummy in the beginning and as Imhotep. The sequence when the mummified Imhotep opens his eyes in the beginning alone is incredibly haunting and unforgettable. Beautiful Zita Johnson is also great in her (double) role. Actually, the whole cast is very good, it most memorably includes Edward van Sloan, the legendary classic Horror actor who also played Van Helsing in Tod Browning's Dracula (1931). Director Karl Freund was mainly active as a fantastic cinematographer. However, the two Horror films he directed, Mad Love of 1935 and this masterpiece (to be precise, he also served as an uncredited co-director of Browning's Dracula), both rank among the greatest classics of the genre. The Mummy is brilliantly photographed, and the makeup department did the job of a century - Karloff just looks uniquely creepy. The Mummy spawned many sequels and rip-offs none of which got anywhere near the brilliance of the original. In 1959, the British Hammer Studios made a remake starring Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing, which is easily the second-best Mummy film I've ever seen. The crappy new Mummy films with should be avoided at all costs. Incredibly haunting, creepy and beautiful Karl Freund's 1932 classic is, and always will be, the one and only true Mummy-masterpiece that buries all the rest. The Mummy is one of the greatest Horror films ever made, and no cinema lover could possibly consider missing it. 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"4 July 2009","score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Egyptian Mummies doubtlessly range among the most fascinating Horror creatures, and yet their overall representation in cinema seems a bit weak, compared to that of other ghoulish fiends.
