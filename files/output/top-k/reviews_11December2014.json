An ogre named Shrek (Mike Meyers), in order to regain his swamp, travels along with an annoying donkey (Eddie Murphy) in order to bring a princess (Cameron Diaz) to a scheming lord, wishing himself King. Pretty clever, huh? Not really. The story fails in a scheming scheme of rudeness and action. Each scene if more obnoxious than the next, leaving you either in love with this dim-witted story or ready to skip the next sequel Dreanmworks throws at us due to having no other creative ideas like Pixar or other animated film companies.

Basically a remake of 1942's Holiday Inn where the title song from this movie was introduced (and deservedly won an Oscar), it adds color, camp, and Danny Kaye to the familiar story. Danny takes over in the role Fred Astaire played in Holiday Inn, and his character adds comedy into the mix, some funny, some cloying. Technicolor loves Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen, and they wear all sorts of gorgeous gowns. Unfortunately, this mixture of pastiche and Technicolor ends up being an extremely mixed bag that brings huge smiles in some scenes, rolled eyes in others.The campiest moment comes with the duet of Sisters, first seen with Vera-Ellen and Clooney, and later repeated by the mincing Crosby and Kaye. The later version was apparently done as a gag and kept in the film. A big production number saluting the old minstrel shows features the tackiest of jokes and the ugliest of costumes. It worked great in Kid Millions in 1934, but in the post war world of 1954, it is a major groaner of a number. Even duller is Kaye's Choreography, as pretentious as it sounds. He does get a nice duet with Vera-Ellen, The Best Things Happen When You're Dancing, while Crosby and Clooney get to sing the beautiful Count Your Blessings Instead of Sheep. Clooney gets a good solo moment with Love, You Didn't Do Right By Me, a mediocre song which becomes better simply because of how she sells it.As for the Christmas sequences, they open and end the film, hence the reason for the title. Dean Jagger plays the retiring General who moves to the aforementioned Holiday Inn after the end of World War II, and is given a rousing send-off. Mary Wickes shines as his housekeeper, but then again, doesn't she always shine no matter what film she's in? The two major Christmas songs are the title song, first repeated by Crosby (who introduced it in Holiday Inn) and later utilized for the lavish finale where the hotel walls open up like a Broadway set. I guess you're supposed to really feel the Christmas spirit when this happens, but had the whole story surrounded the holidays rather than just the opening and conclusion, I would have been much happier. A minor little number, Snow, celebrates the season nicely, but its not one of Berlin's better songs. Michael Curtiz seems an odd choice for director of a big, elephantine musical. This was a busy time for Irving Berlin as he just had another catalog of his songs done on screen (the much better There's No Business Like Show Business) and the previous year's Call Me Madam, both with Ethel Merman. So while he may have been considered, as Jerome Kern called him, American Music, he was represented elsewhere. This musical certainly has its fans, and while I applaud much of what is in here, I have to consider this one a missed opportunity, much like Crosby's next remake of an old film of his, Anything Goes, where the same studio forgot that it was based on an old Cole Porter hit, and equally as disengaging.

As a current high schooler, I can attest to the fact that conformity is extant among teenagers. There are very few Neil Perry's today, and the few that remain are mostly seen as rather queer. This is a sad truth, but the fact remains that for some inconceivable reason people are more inclined to follow popular whims than their own interests. This movie introduces the idea what is socially cool and accepted isn't necessarily enjoyable. The poetry that Keating shows his students isn't stuff that's going to make you the popular guy in school for knowing, but it's inspiring and awesome.This is seen in the progression of the students' attitudes toward the Dead Poet's ideas. At first they react to Keating's lessons with confusion and almost fear, especially in the case of Todd Anderson. When Keating tells them of the cult that he started when he was in their position in a way that appeals to them, they begin to realize that it might be worth the effort to go deeper into some of this poetry. After a couple of meetings, they have fully embraced it and realize the wonders and opportunities that it provides. They now start to question authority, especially in the cases of Dalton and Neil. Keating's lesson of walking in your own way is especially helpful in this regard. The really interesting thing about Keating's teaching is that he does not actually have that much screen time, but he does have a profound impact on his pupils. He really leaves them to make their own conclusions as to what his lessons mean with only a few featured lessons. In other words, he does an inception with them.We can see that each of them acts upon his lessons differently and seize the day after their own fashion. Dalton, Neil, Knox, and even Todd to and extent use his lessons as inspiration for courageous acts, again in different ways. Pitts, Meeks, and Cameron are also inspired by the lessons and the secret meetings, though they do not have a storyline to prove it so concretely. While all of the main roles get a pretty good amount of development, the most prominent plot is that of Neil Perry's dispute with his father. This is the one point where Keating gives explicit and specific advice to any of his students. The villainy of Mr. Perry is not at all implausible since the world is full of over-assertive parents, though his motive is understandable. Neil's (SPOILER ALERT) suicide at the end at first struck me as surprising and uncalled for, but when I took a step back, it made sense. I think this was because I didn't fully understand what he was being forced to leave when his father took him out of school. It seemed like he was only upset about the loss of being able to act, but it's also the loss of all of his friends and Mr. Keating. So Mr. Perry is essentially destroying Neil's world. The events that result after Neil's tragedy are primarily driven by the other villain, Mr. Nolan. He is very pro-conformism and by the books, which we have learned to despise by the end of the movie. He has some great villainous moments at the end with the dismissal and canning of Keating, though I felt like that process got unnecessarily drawn out. The final minute of the film with the rebellion of the class is a great ending that adds a positive and inspiring touch to the darkness and gloom of recent events. To wrap up, I would recommend this movie to people who like inspiration of a non-forceful nature. It's a very character and story driven movie with no action or comedy. In other words, it's interesting over entertaining. As with Keating's students, each viewer will take something different out of the movie. It's good to watch with people that will be genuinely interested in watching it.

It's an adaptation of a Stephen King short story, centering on 4 friends who go out on a journey to retrieve a dead body. After watching Stand By Me there's little to no reason to watch any other coming of age film, since this shows all the genre is about in under 90 minutes and leaves you glowing. It manages to get a remarkable amount of material in only 88 minutes. It hasn't really aged at all and there aren't many flaws. SBM proves that child actors don't always deserve the hate, as the cast are very strong throughout- look out for a pre Jack Bauer Keifer Sutherland. All of the characters are well developed and have interesting relationships, and even though you only know them for an hour and half you grow to care about all of them. Rob Reiner directs the film superbly, wringing fine cinematography out of a fairly small drama and creating plenty of exciting and funny moments as well. SBM seems to have it all.The script is one of the best scripts of all time. With amazing opening and closing lines, loads of drama and plenty of emotional sophistication this is an incredibly moving and entertaining picture which has a universal appeal. SBM's plot doesn't feel ludicrous or OTT and it'll speak to everyone, grown ups as well as young people. The 15 certificate is unfortunate in my opinion as it means people the same age as the characters in the film may not be able to watch it, so while the script is great the number of 4 letter words could easily have been reduced. That's the only more obvious flaw of the film, which also doesn't take up much time and is easy to watch. SBM is a very emotional film, but it's also an adventurous and entertaining one that won't fail to touch... well anyone. A great coming of age story overall; one of the best films I've seen all year and one of the most essential films currently on Netflix UK.

SBM's plot doesn't feel ludicrous or OTT and it'll speak to everyone, grown ups as well as young people. The 15 certificate is unfortunate in my opinion as it means people the same age as the characters in the film may not be able to watch it, so while the script is great the number of 4 letter words could easily have been reduced. That's the only more obvious flaw of the film, which also doesn't take up much time and is easy to watch. SBM is a very emotional film, but it's also an adventurous and entertaining one that won't fail to touch... well anyone.

It's an adaptation of a Stephen King short story, centering on 4 friends who go out on a journey to retrieve a dead body. After watching Stand By Me there's little to no reason to watch any other coming of age film, since this shows all the genre is about in under 90 minutes and leaves you glowing. It manages to get a remarkable amount of material in only 88 minutes. It hasn't really aged at all and there aren't many flaws. SBM proves that child actors don't always deserve the hate, as the cast are very strong throughout- look out for a pre Jack Bauer Keifer Sutherland. All of the characters are well developed and have interesting relationships, and even though you only know them for an hour and half you grow to care about all of them. Rob Reiner directs the film superbly, wringing fine cinematography out of a fairly small drama and creating plenty of exciting and funny moments as well.

Now that's a quick win! Along with all the other movies Quentin Tarantino was ever involved in, I love every repeated viewing of this film and I say all the characters' lines simultaneously with them. Even now, nearly 20 years after its first release, it still qualifies as one of the most successful crossbreeds between action\/thriller and my beloved horror genre, and the film still stands proud and solid thanks to the fast-paced script, the fabulous dialogs, the terrific acting performances and &#x96; of course &#x96; the excessive use of gore and bloodshed! From Dusk till Dawn starts out as a wild gangster\/chase movie, with George Clooney (back when he was still desperately trying to get rid of his goody- two-shoes ER reputation) and QT himself as the violent and unhinged Gecko brothers on the run for State Troopers, Texas Rangers and all other various sorts of authorities. They hijack former preacher Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel) and his teenage daughter and adopted son, who're road-tripping in their motorhome in order to process the loss of their wife and mother. Hidden inside the motorhome Seth and Ritchie Gecko cross the Mexican border and immediately head towards an exclusive bar called the Titty Twister. The film then halfway transforms, totally unexpectedly and unpredictable (at least the first time), into an outrageous splatter flick as it turns out that the staff and regular customers of this particular bar turn out to be vampires feeding on passing truckers and bikers. This may sound stupid and far-fetched, but in Tarantino's script it works wonderfully well and the battle between fugitive gangsters and wicked bloodsuckers is spectacular as well as funny and even suspenseful. The film is chock-full of references towards classic horror films, and particularly vampire classics obviously, and stars a handful of nearly-forgotten genre icons in small supportive roles. There's a lovely little role for Blaxploitation hero Fred Williamson, as a tough vampire killer, and a (sadly too short) cameo appearance by John Saxon. Make-up genius Tom Savino clearly also terrifically enjoyed himself as a dressed in leather biker by the nickname Sex Machine. The direction is in the hands of Tarantino's equally gifted pal Robert Rodriguez, who also invited his buddies Cheech Marin, Danny Trejo and Salma Hayek. The latter's sensual dance on top of the bar tables, just prior to hell breaking loose, is definitely also one of the highlights of the film. From Dusk till Dawn is highly recommended entertainment that I'll undoubtedly watch countless times more. The sequels, on the other hand, suck like washed up vampire grannies.

I don't know. Tarantino has said during interviews how he got the name but never exactly said the meaning. I don't care what it means, because that's an awesome sounding name! And the Dogs themselves have an awesome image. So the viewer will be suckered into seeing an independent masterpiece. Tarantino knows how to advertise well. All he did was use a bunch of recycled stories and mesh them together to create this. Tarantino had been a movie buff his whole life with no formal or professional training or education in the business. He would just make movies with his friends and gain experience that way. While Reservoir Dogs is probably his easiest film, it is not his worst. Reservoir Dogs has a very simple concept six criminals (Keitel, Roth, Buscemi, Madsen, Bunker, Tarantino) are gathered by a gangster and his son (Tierney, Penn) to pull off a major jewel heist. Everything that could go wrong, does as they discover a rat is among them. These kinds of movies have been done, good and bad ones. Even the bad ones hold some suspense as the viewer is curious to see who the bad guy is. Tarantino, being the genius that he is, gives away who the rat is about midway through, but is able to hold the same amount of suspense by showing the movie out of order and the Dogs in huge trouble. Tarantino loved showing his movies out of order. It made them much better than they actually were. If this was in order, it would have been just another brutally fun dark-comedy. Tarantino putting the movie out of order is like adding great background music to simple scenes, making them ten-times better than they actually are. Tarantino also introduced his knack for dialogue and characterization. If I'm not mistaken, Reservoir Dogs held a record for most f-words in a feature film at approximately 272. That record was broken by Casino in 1995 and again by Wolf of Wall Street in 2013. When I first saw this, I was shocked to hear the f-word be used that many times. When I watched Casino and Wolf of Wall Street, I wasn't really shocked by the foul language like I was in this. I have seen Reservoir Dogs many times since then and the swearing has gotten less shocking for me. Aside from the abundance of swearing, the general dialogue in which these words are placed in are funny and clever. In the opening scene, they talk about the Madonna song, Like A Virgin. A group of thugs would be talking about something weird like an 80's song in a very derogatory manner. The dialogue paves the way for some cool characters. Most may be stereotypes, but the dialogue makes them rise above traditional stereotypes we all know about.Reservoir Dogs is perhaps best known for its look and style. The Dogs are dressed up in black and white suites with black shades carrying hand-guns. Their hide-out just looks like its the place for a gang-beat to go down. That portion is very iconic and has since it has been mimicked in various games and shows that follow. The rawness and brutality this movie has to offer is what was poked at the most and what I'm poked it. Lots of blood and gore, but very little violence. I have seen this at many video places in the their action sections. I felt cheated out. A brutal movie with no violence is a weird combo. Lots of people liked it, but I found this to be a case of you can't have one without the other. Anyway, I highly recommend Reservoir Dogs.

Even more so than The Miracle on 34th Street and It's a Wonderful Life, this Christmas classic really touches me with the feeling that all is right in a world that sometimes seems so wrong. Confused adults need spiritual guidance, and that comes in the form of an angel, the dashing Cary Grant who focuses on an Episcopalian Bishop (David Niven), his lovely wife (Loretta Young), and various others whom he encounters on his visit to earth. Like other human beings, Niven wants something desperately for the holidays, and that is the funds to build a bigger cathedral which he can only do with the aide of wealthy widow Gladys Cooper, a domineering parishioner who holds the purse strings and has plenty of demands. Niven has no idea that his seemingly idealistic marriage is in deep trouble, and Grant's presence brings temptation into the wake of the season of giving.What could be truly schmaltzy ends up being totally charming, and that is due to the excellent screenplay, tight direction, beautiful photography and music, and the most outstanding cast assembled for a holiday film. In addition to the aforementioned stars are Monty Woolley as an eccentric friend of Young and Niven's (whom Grant claims he knows), James Gleason as a cynical cab driver who really gets into the spirit of Christmas thanks to Grant's presence, Elsa Lanchaster as a befuddled maid, and the sweet Karolyn Grimes as Niven and Young's daughter, an adorable little girl who truly represents the spirit of Christmas. Even the minor players have a thing or two to contribute to the touching story, among them Sara Haden and Regis Toomey, as well as a gaggle of gossipy old ladies who are instantly suspicious when they see Grant and Young together then become charmed and forget about their initial tongue wagging.There are so many small plot points in this which remain in the memory long after the film is over, including the story of old coins Woolley has which he thinks are worthless, a visit to a skating rink where even clumsy Gleason finds he can skate like Sonja Henie, and a snowball fight where young Grimes gets the last laugh. But ultimately, this is a film about the spirit of the holidays, and when Grant tells Karolyn the story of the first Christmas, it truly is touching. The imperious Cooper gives the old pro's try with her sometimes touching, mostly tough character really melting into a pile of mush when she meets Grant. Cary is a bit of a mischievous angel, as evidenced in a scene where Niven ends up sitting in a recently varnished chair at Cooper's mansion, and for a minute, it isn't clear what Grant's motives really are. But as fast as angels arrive, they leave, and they are only there long enough to do what they need to do.A modernized version of this (The Preacher's Wife) kept the heart and soul of the original film and is also very much worth seeing. Whitney Houston's magnetic smile brought a light into the update, and is a reminder of how lovely Young could be when she simply played her role and didn't try to be too noble. The fact that her character is obviously attracted to Grant in spite of her moral fiber makes her much more human, and the fact that Niven is far from perfect even being a religious leader makes him extremely identifiable as well. Christmas movies may come out by the dozens now, but they really don't make em' like this anymore.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"},{"date":"11 December 2014","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" The true spirit of the holiday season comes alive every time I see this movie. Even more so than The Miracle on 34th Street and It's a Wonderful Life, this Christmas classic really touches me with the feeling that all is right in a world that sometimes seems so wrong. Confused adults need spiritual guidance, and that comes in the form of an angel, the dashing Cary Grant who focuses on an Episcopalian Bishop (David Niven), his lovely wife (Loretta Young), and various others whom he encounters on his visit to earth. Like other human beings, Niven wants something desperately for the holidays, and that is the funds to build a bigger cathedral which he can only do with the aide of wealthy widow Gladys Cooper, a domineering parishioner who holds the purse strings and has plenty of demands. Niven has no idea that his seemingly idealistic marriage is in deep trouble, and Grant's presence brings temptation into the wake of the season of giving.What could be truly schmaltzy ends up being totally charming, and that is due to the excellent screenplay, tight direction, beautiful photography and music, and the most outstanding cast assembled for a holiday film. In addition to the aforementioned stars are Monty Woolley as an eccentric friend of Young and Niven's (whom Grant claims he knows), James Gleason as a cynical cab driver who really gets into the spirit of Christmas thanks to Grant's presence, Elsa Lanchaster as a befuddled maid, and the sweet Karolyn Grimes as Niven and Young's daughter, an adorable little girl who truly represents the spirit of Christmas. Even the minor players have a thing or two to contribute to the touching story, among them Sara Haden and Regis Toomey, as well as a gaggle of gossipy old ladies who are instantly suspicious when they see Grant and Young together then become charmed and forget about their initial tongue wagging.There are so many small plot points in this which remain in the memory long after the film is over, including the story of old coins Woolley has which he thinks are worthless, a visit to a skating rink where even clumsy Gleason finds he can skate like Sonja Henie, and a snowball fight where young Grimes gets the last laugh. But ultimately, this is a film about the spirit of the holidays, and when Grant tells Karolyn the story of the first Christmas, it truly is touching. The imperious Cooper gives the old pro's try with her sometimes touching, mostly tough character really melting into a pile of mush when she meets Grant. Cary is a bit of a mischievous angel, as evidenced in a scene where Niven ends up sitting in a recently varnished chair at Cooper's mansion, and for a minute, it isn't clear what Grant's motives really are. But as fast as angels arrive, they leave, and they are only there long enough to do what they need to do.A modernized version of this (The Preacher's Wife) kept the heart and soul of the original film and is also very much worth seeing. Whitney Houston's magnetic smile brought a light into the update, and is a reminder of how lovely Young could be when she simply played her role and didn't try to be too noble. The fact that her character is obviously attracted to Grant in spite of her moral fiber makes her much more human, and the fact that Niven is far from perfect even being a religious leader makes him extremely identifiable as well.

But since the movie has Phil come up with the idea himself, we can't help thinking, It's about time!When he finally does start pretending to be a Jew, he is shocked by all the prejudice he encounters, as when he tries to check into a high-class hotel and is refused service.

Centering on a brilliant working-class youngster who's forced to come to terms with his creative genius and true feelings. Miramax could score big with extremely enjoyable pic whose old-fashioned virtues should play well in big cities as well as in Middle American shopping malls.Emanuel Levy A towering performance by Matt Damon in the lead, and a superlative ensemble headed by a terrific Robin Williams, elevate Good Will Hunting, Gus Van Sant's emotionally involving psychological drama, a notch or two above the mainstream therapeutic sensibility of its story. Centering on a brilliant working-class youngster who's forced to come to terms with his creative genius and true feelings, this beautifully realized tale is always engaging and often quite touching. With the right marketing, Miramax could score big with an extremely enjoyable picture whose old-fashioned virtues should play well in big cities as well as in Middle American shopping malls.Fans of Van Sant's earlier, offbeat films may be disappointed by the more conventional attributes of Good Will Hunting, a problem drama dealing with the complex relationship between a rough, extraordinarily gifted kid and his equally troubled and bruised therapist. Thematically, film recalls Robert Redford's Ordinary People and especially Jodie Foster's Little Man Tate, which also revolved around a child genius of the working class.Nonetheless, it's a testament to Van Sant's idiosyncratic talent that he endows the narrative, particularly its first chapters, with the nihilistic humor and deceptively casual style that have marked his best work, Drugstore Cowboy and the more eccentric My Own Private Idaho.Co-written by thesps Damon and Ben Affleck, who have known each other since childhood in Boston, protagonist is Will Hunting (Damon), a 20-year-old lad who works as a janitor at MIT and spends most of his time with his coarse friends at the neighborhood bar. Blessed with a certain genius, Will, who has never attended college, can summon obscure historical references based on his exceptional photographic memory. He can also solve difficult mathematical problems with an ease that makes MIT's richer and more educated students envious of him.

The movie does not take you down the road you think it will, veering off unexpectedly in places. You start off rooting for Julia Roberts to pull off her mission, but as she resorts to more and more underhand tactics, (the email was simply devious) you actually start to hope she fails and want Diaz to keep Mulroney and the wedding to go ahead.All the leads are superb, smiling that killer smile, Roberts has never been better, while Diaz is excellent in one of her first good roles and the handsome Mulroney makes an engaging romantic couple with both Roberts and Diaz. But even with that fantastic trio, Everett steals every scene he is in. The sing a long around the table is nothing short of fantastic.

In Close Encounters Of The Third Kind the proposition is put forth that at least these particular aliens have been here before and in fact have taken samples of human kind back to study. In the present day two people have experiences with aliens, both just average folks. One is Richard Dreyfuss who is lineman and while out on a job encounters some whizzing space ships, some strange lights, and the after effects of said encounter, a kind of soft sunburn that leaves one a bit orange. After that he thinks of nothing else and is compelled to go to a certain spot in the far west of the USA. His wife Teri Garr throws Dreyfuss out of the house.The second is Melinda Dillon who got a Best Supporting Actress nomination for being a homemaker whose child is taken by the aliens. She too has a vision to go to the same spot.The journey and what they find there is the sum and substance of the plot of Close Encounters Of The Third Kind. Close Encounters Of The Third Kind is some unique viewing experience. Stephen Spielberg's technical wizardry linked to real stories about people like Dreyfuss, Garr, and Dillon every day people we can universally identify with.Two things I liked about the film very much. The first is the discovery that sound at its basic element is a method of communication. Music's tonal quality is universal. The second is that the aliens might not be human, but they reveal themselves to at least one person in the cast that they are most humane.Including Dillon's nomination Close Encounters Of The Third Kind received a flock of recognition with several Oscar nominations including Best Director for Stephen Spielberg, but not Best Picture. It's a film that is imaginative, entertaining and fun and has a universal message. For another millenia at least this will be classic.

The story is based on a 1902 novel by George B. McCutcheon. This movie, with Richard Pryor and John Candy stacks up well with the other films. It's updated ($30 million in 1985 versus $1 million in 1945), with prices, costs and other things being quite different. It has some novel twists and pokes fun at New York politics. So, it succeeds overall. Richard Pryor is very good as Monty Brewster, and most others of the cast give very good performances. But, John Candy stands out as Spike Nolan. He's a delight to watch with his frustration over Monty's not wanting to invest a little of his many millions for the future. The two have just come from nowheresville, and Spike remembers all too well that they could wind up back there. So, every time Monty hires someone for a ludicrous salary, Spike wants it to be half or less. Except for some sparse vulgar language, this film is generally clean. The baseball scenes with Monty on the pitcher's mound and Spike behind the plate are hilarious.
