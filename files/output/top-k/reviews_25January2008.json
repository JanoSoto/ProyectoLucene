[{"date":"25 January 2008","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Films that are carried by the performances by the actors are usually character pieces that focus primarily on the actors, like Junebug, or many independent films. The Talented Mr. Ripley is such a film, although it does have a twisted plot that services the characters as much as the film itself.Not wanting to spoil the movie, I'll describe as much as I can. Tom Ripley (Matt Damon) has an uncanny skill of imitating people (their voices, forging signatures, etc). So one day, a wealthy man (James Rebhorn) offers Tom $1000 including expenses to pose as an old college friend of his son, Dickie (Jude Law), and persuade him to come home. Dickie has been living a life that everyone would envy. Living in luxury in beautiful coastal Italy and sending all the bills to dear old Dad. So Tom goes to Italy with his false persona to complete his task, but things don't go as planned.That's really all I can give. It's an engaging story, one that has the marks of a thriller, but is too slow moving to be one. Not that this makes this film fail. While it's not exactly a movie that will get the adrenaline pumping, it is good as a drama, which is probably the intent. In my opinion, this was probably a good decision, because the setting just feels like a place where anyone would love to buy a summer home there. Director Anthony Minghella allows the viewer to completely soak in all of the atmosphere and the beauty of Italy, which would not be possible if it had the suspense of The Silence of the Lambs. Furthermore, it helps us understand the characters, because hell, if I were there, I wouldn't want to leave either.If there is any reason to see this movie, it's for the acting. The performances by the three main characters (Cate Blanchett got some top billing, but she was barely in it-a point I'll get to later) are outstanding. Matt Damon is terrific as Tom, whose instability is well-illustrated. This is not the pretty-boy Matt Damon that many people are used to. He's a geeky kind of guy, complete with gangly teeth and glasses. It's a great performance, except that when he tries to be creepy, he doesn't succeed as well as he wants to. Gwyneth Paltrow is in top form here as Dickie's fiancée Marge. This is easily her best performance, much better than her Oscar-winning turn in the previous year's Shakespeare in Love (How she won an Oscar for that movie I'll never know...). At first she seems to be just as much of a snob as her lover, but as we get to know her, we realize that she's not (at least not like Dickie). One of her best scenes is where she describes to Tom how loving Dickie is as painful as it is great. When he pays attention to you, it feels as if you have everything, but when he doesn't, you feel so alone. Or something like that. But the way she says it (and in conjunction with Law's performance) is a perfect example of Dickie. When she's with him, she's happy, but when she's not, she's really lonely. Cate Blanchett is great (her American accent is flawless), but she's on screen too little to be developed very much. Philip Seymour Hoffman and Jack Davenport have smaller roles, but are just as good. Watch for a brief appearance by the always great Philip Baker Hall.But the real joy of the film is Jude Law. His performance is the definition of a breakout role. This is as it should be, because Law is tremendously talented. Here he is a complete knockout. He's a spoiled brat who cares about people only when it suits him, but he doesn't resort to the stuffy rich snob cliché that populates many movies. Often he's pretty sympathetic. When he pays attention to Tom, he's a great guy, but we don't really notice what an asshole he is until later. In fact, he's so great that he upstages everyone else, which considering the quality of the performances, is pretty impressive.This is a great character piece. It's marketed as a thriller, so if that was what it was intended to be as, then it failed in that respect. But it works as a drama, so if you keep that in mind, it's a well spent 2 hours.

Why it won the Academy Award was because it was so shocking at that time that Hollywood, brand new its freedom to show anything it wanted with all moral codes abandoned, wanted to celebrate that fact. Filmmakers then were like an immature six-year-old with an unlimited expense account at the local candy store.

It also hoped, I'm sure, to shock mainstream audiences. Well, it succeeded on that level. Audiences were stunned at what they say and heard and the Academy, proud of itself for being able to display filth and make money at the same time, couldn't help but bestow honors upon this piece of gilded garbage.Forty years ago, as a very young man, I found this film fascinating, too. However, seeing it again in the 1990s left such a bad taste in my mouth I never watched to view it again. The acting was good, but so what? Acting is good in many films. Nobody ever said Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight couldn't act. Hoffman was particularly good in his younger days in playing wacked-out people.

Yes, Ratso is a character you'll never forget, and Joe Buck (Voight) is one you want to forget, but the story is so sordid, it overwhelms the fine acting.This movie isn't art, and it isn't worthy of its many awards; it only pushed the envelope big-time in 1969 and that's why it is so fondly remembered in the hearts of film people and critics. It's two hours of profanity and ultra-sleazy, religious cheap shots, glorifying weirdos (Andy Warhol even gets in the act - no surprise), and generally despicable people.I did like the catchy song, Everybody's Talking' that helped make Harry Nilsson famous, but even that was bogus because Fred Neil wrote the song and sang it better, before Nilsson did it....and few people have ever heard of Neil (which is their loss).

It is a thriller\/horror.Overall, the film was well-done. Although not as great as some of Hitchcock's other films, he definitely left his mark on it, as he does with all of his films the dark humor, the haunting mom character, and, of course, the blonde female victim.Using key collaborators which have worked with him on other projects, Hitchcock used his skilled team to make a great film. Robert Burks, the cinematographer who worked with Hitchcock on other projects such as Strangers on a Train (1951), Dial M for Murder (1954), Rear Window (1954), To Catch a Thief (1955), Vertigo (1958), and North by Northwest (1959) did a remarkable job. This one shot, where he shoots upwards, after the last attack, is terrifying as I kept expecting another one.What I found in Hitchcock's films, specifically in this one, is that the action scenes aren't the scary part, the anticipation to them is. The scene in which Melanie goes up the stairs and you just know something bad is going to happen and there will be birds was more nerve-wrecking than the actual attack. This, in my opinion, is Hitchcock's strong point. He is able to hold the suspense in such a way that is shuddersome.Regarding the comedy, in the scene in the diner, the one guy who kept commenting on it being the end of the world was fitting for Hitchcock's humor, as it was more comedic than actually serious.Although there was no musical score in the film, Bernard Hermann is still credited as a sound consultant. I found that fact interesting, as there wasn't even a beginning score, just the sound of birds.The female character was, of course, the victim once again in this film as in many others of Hitchcock. Male superiority is clearly seen. An example in this film is when the man at the gas station is hit. Mitch orders Melanie to stay inside while the rest of the hopeless females and children watch on the sidelines as the brave men go outside to try and save the day.As said earlier, the film was overall a good one. It is too overrated when it comes down to it being as scary as people say. The performances were good, nothing great or exceptional such as in Hitchcock's Rear Window.

This last Dirty Harry flick may not be imaginative. It only readopts the exact scheme of its predecessors. But that's a good thing, in my opinion, since I love the entire Dirty Harry series, and it certainly didn't need a change. In case you have seen the other films, you more or less know what to expect. The story isn't too imaginative (allthough it's good enough to keep the viewer's attention throughout the movie), and the new characters aren't too special either. What really makes this film a joy to watch is, once again, Dirty Harry Callahan, his hate of reporters, his disrespect for his superiors, his bad temper, his ability to shoot a whole bunch of attackers in few seconds and his unbreakable will to 'do what's right', without mercy and regardless of consequences.

Other than many movies of the kind, Extreme Prejudice has an excellent cast. The story is not more promising than your average action flick, but this movie scores with good, violent action and great performances from actors such as Nick Nolte, Powers Boothe and Michael Ironside.Jack Benteen (Nick Nolte) is a tough Texas Ranger who does his job near the Mexican border with a great sense of duty. His major ambition is to take down a drug cartel run in Mexico by the American Cash Bailey (Powers Boothe), and he has dedicated himself to this goal, irrespective of dangers or fatalities. Not only is Cash Bailey a drug-lord, however, he is also Jack's best childhood friend and the former lover of Jack's sexy Mexican bar singer girlfriend Sarita (Maria Conchita Alonso). Apart from Jack, a bunch of former soldiers lead by a mysterious Major (Michael Ironside) also have some task to carry out in the desert borderland...The story is OK, but nothing spectacular, and the film's major qualities are the violent action, the characters' macho attitude and tough-mindedness, and, especially the great cast. Nick Nolte is excellent in his role of the silent tough-guy Texas Ranger. Powers Boothe also delivers a great performance as the unscrupulous drug-lord Cash, and beautiful Maria Conchita Alonso fits in her role very well. Michael Ironside is a great actor, and his specialty is playing tough guys or sinister characters. Both attributes apply to the his role in Extreme Prejudice.

But his life has taken a tragic turn he loses an award to new superstar Hansel, his friends die in a horrible gasoline accident and he is ready to quit the business. Things seemingly turn around when he is offered a job as the face of the new Derelicte clothing line, but his handler has more sinister intentions.I'm not particularly a fan of Ben Stiller or his films. He's often annoying and not very funny... and not even particularly handsome. He is a better background figure (Happy Gilmore) than a lead (Something About Mary). So why does this film entertain me? I'll tell you the celebrity cameos. We have some great co-stars (Christine Taylor is awesome and sexy, and Will Ferrell has one of the best roles of his career here).What sold it for me (besides Farrell) was the Billy Zane cameo. Sure, Lance Bass and Fred Durst were funny. Natalie Portman is hot. And David Bowie does the best David Bowie impression on earth. But Zane sold the film when Owen Wilson said, You should listen to your friend Billy Zane. He's a cool dude. That was the funniest line in the film (but so true).In all fairness, Stiller is better here than in other films. And there are plenty of memorable scenes -- the gasoline accident scene takes the cake, with perfect music playing (Wham!) and everything looking just right. I also really enjoy the trance sequence -- one of Ferrell's best scenes ever filmed.As far as Ferrell-Stiller-Wilson movies go, this one isn't at the top of the pile, but it's clearly above the halfway mark.

On the whole, it has to be considered a success, but broken down into its major components -- a suspense thriller on the one hand, a romantic drama on the other -- a sizable distinction is revealed. As a thriller, it's right up there with Hitchcock's best films; as a romance it's one step up from mediocre (well, maybe a step and a half, but only because we're talking about Ingrid Bergman and Cary Grant here). Also, the romance and thriller elements basically just run in parallel throughout the film, whereas I'd have preferred to see them woven together. My impression was that this never quite happened, though it comes close in a scene or two. (Compare Notorious in these respects to North by Northwest, which I found was superb from both the thriller and romance angles and involved more influence of each on the other.) The film's greatest achievement lies in its presentation of the precarious balance created as characters begin uncovering each other's secrets. The espionage makes for a wonderfully complicated bit of game theory. There are certain facts known to all of the characters, others that are secrets held only by one or two characters, others that were secrets but have since been discovered by another character (unbeknownst to those who formerly held the secrets), and still other former secrets whose discovery has been discovered by those who originally held them (unbeknownst to the discoverer who now overestimates his or her advantage). If it seems a bit overdone, it's only because I couldn't think of a better way of concisely explaining it. The film is in fact remarkably elegant in fitting these pieces together.Had the project been handed to a lesser director, I'm sure it all would have come across as stilted and forced; either that or a lot of the material would have just been cut to make the story more manageable. It's the sort of story one might read in a novel and think, This would make such a great movie, but they really couldn't do it justice in under four hours. Oh well.

As a thriller, it's right up there with Hitchcock's best films; as a romance it's one step up from mediocre (well, maybe a step and a half, but only because we're talking about Ingrid Bergman and Cary Grant here). Also, the romance and thriller elements basically just run in parallel throughout the film, whereas I'd have preferred to see them woven together. My impression was that this never quite happened, though it comes close in a scene or two. (Compare Notorious in these respects to North by Northwest, which I found was superb from both the thriller and romance angles and involved more influence of each on the other.) The film's greatest achievement lies in its presentation of the precarious balance created as characters begin uncovering each other's secrets. The espionage makes for a wonderfully complicated bit of game theory. There are certain facts known to all of the characters, others that are secrets held only by one or two characters, others that were secrets but have since been discovered by another character (unbeknownst to those who formerly held the secrets), and still other former secrets whose discovery has been discovered by those who originally held them (unbeknownst to the discoverer who now overestimates his or her advantage). If it seems a bit overdone, it's only because I couldn't think of a better way of concisely explaining it. The film is in fact remarkably elegant in fitting these pieces together.Had the project been handed to a lesser director, I'm sure it all would have come across as stilted and forced; either that or a lot of the material would have just been cut to make the story more manageable. It's the sort of story one might read in a novel and think, This would make such a great movie, but they really couldn't do it justice in under four hours. Oh well. This one weighs in at around 100 minutes I think. It's quite an accomplishment in that respect, and if the love story falls short of Casablanca, well I can forgive it for that.

If newborn babies had his power, they'd be as the monster was, striking out at what they don't understand or who does not give them instantly what they want.

Sadly Van Sloan does not handle the creature quite as well as he does Bela Lugosi.Though Frankenstein and the other Universal horror classics have taken quite a beating from first Abbott&Costello, then the gorier Hammer films recreations and finally from Mel Brooks, Frankenstein still has the power to entertain and to fascinate.

The obvious film to compare this one to would be the 1933 masterpiece 'King Kong', and indeed the two monsters shared a film together in 1962 (which I've not seen). There really is no competition as to which is the better individual film, however, with King Kong taking all the honours. The basic story here is obvious to anyone who knows anything about Godzilla and, of course, it focuses on a giant dinosaur that emerges from the sea. The film was released during the cold war, so naturally its nuclear weapons that are to blame and pretty soon a small fishing island is being torn apart by the blood-thirsty monster. Some time later, an expedition is lead to the island, which leads to the rediscovery of Godzilla, who then threatens to provide a much bigger problem for the whole of Japan...My main problem with this film is the lack of entertainment value. The director appears to be making some point about nuclear weapons (the film was made just nine years after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), and the point, which is is made through a giant rampaging, does carry a bit more weight than it maybe should. The film deserves kudos for the special effects; while no more impressive than the 21 year old effects seen in King Kong, it's always good to see a film where effort has gone into bringing the action to life. This is all good, but for me the film didn't deliver what I wanted. I really just wanted some entertainment and Godzilla doesn't deliver enough of it. The sequences in which the monster is attacking are all good and worthy of note, but the story surrounding the central characters is very weak indeed. The monster itself is a classic cinematic icon (though not as much so as King Kong, or at least not in the west), and every scene which features it is memorable. Overall, its obvious why this film had a place in history and I can understand why it is well liked; but it didn't do much for me.

Second, I am not American, I'm a proud Canadian. I'm not enlisted in our military, nor am I a veteran.Saving Private Ryan has turned out to be, in my opinion, one of the most moving films in the last 40 years. So realistic that Veterans of the War and in particular Operation Overlord (or Operation Atlantic for the Canadians participation on June 6, 1944) have a hard time watching the movie.Now, the events that the 8 soldiers in the movie participate in are an amalgamation of several different events that happened to different people throughout the real war While Charlie Company, 2nd Rangers Battalion did participate in Overlord, they were at Pointe du Hoc, not Omaha Beach as depicted here. The rescue of Sgt Fredrick Niland was not done by a group of rangers, but rather by a French chaplain. Bridges were a common point of contention and it was not unheard of to see a small group of soldiers defending such an important transportation artery.Saving Private Ryan takes these events and more and weaves them into an incredible story of the courage and honor that has left me stunned time and time again. Unlike so many movie characters these days, I see a depth to these characters. Mellish is a Jew. Miller is a schoolteacher. Jackson is a Christian. And of course the somewhat nerdy Corporal Upham.On the other side we have Steamboat Willie, unfortunately the only German (being German does NOT make him Nazi) soldier we see a whole lot of. It is likely that, like the Americans, he is only following orders, as the Nazi Regime in those days recruited as many able bodied soldiers as they could - including POWs, like the Czechs.In addition if you think that the blood and gore is an attempt to provide entertainment value to this film, then maybe you need to look up the real WWII. In contrast SPR is much more sterile in that respect than the war really was. War is a bloody, horrible, terrible thing, and SPR comes very close to that reality. Blown off limbs, spilled guts, and blood are unfortunate realities.If your looking for a film to watch for entertainment value, don't bother with this one. If, on the other hand, you want to watch a movie that is a worthy tribute to our Veterans - American, Canadian, British - this one is well worth your while.

As a new fan, I hadn't heard much of his earlier stuff. I then got a recommendation from a friend on this site that this is one of the best horror films of the last decade or so. He was correct in every single way. This film truly is a masterpiece.Guillermo Del Toro always seems to find fantastic child actors who are absolutely perfect for their roles.

","genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"25 January 2008","score":"","review":" One of the most original films I've ever seen. Woody Allen uses a bounty of different techniques in the film to the point where it almost feels experimental, but he doesn't base the film around these techniques. He breaks the fourth dimension (in a very High Fidelity fashion), has the characters walking around in their own flashbacks, has subtitles detailing the characters' thoughts and fragments the story but he never overdoes any of the techniques. He makes them all feel natural and doesn't use anything for the entire film. In doing this it all feels very fresh and vibrant and moves at a quick pace. It's ninety minute running time was also quite nice with so many films running well over two hours these days. Allen integrates these techniques into a very relatable story of the relationship between the neurotic, self-destructive Alvy Singer (Allen) and the beautiful, intelligent aspiring singer Annie Hall (Diane Keaton). I found Alvy's nervousness and cynicism to be very relatable to my own personality and that really helped me to connect with this character and feel his emotions as the film progressed. Of course the fact that it was absolutely witty and hilarious really helped my love for it.

Therefore I sat down to watch Brother, via Film4, peppered with positive expectation. I was not disappointed.There is something about the man Kitano which is most intriguing. This element of the man translates onto his films most effectively. Fortunately I was completely ignorant as to what to expect from Brother except the rudimentary blurb within my television programme guide. Immediately, upon seeing Kitano, I was transfixed. Within his acting he carries the ability shared only with Steve McQueen which can only be summed up through a critic's quote I read once in the 70s referring to McQueen, He can act with the back of his head. Mr Kitano possesses this same gift. Add to this the fact that he wrote, edited, directed and starred in Brother only stimulates my interest in the man to a greater degree.Beat Takeshi has a menace about him and his character within this film is unpredictable or, as a line in this film commented inscrutable. Perfect for the character of Aniki. Despite the violence within this epic the film is primarily Kitano's character and relationships.True, he goes from incident to incident placing himself in ever more perilous situations as this is the character of the story but I see more to the film than this surface fundamental impression. The film appears to be more in line with the title Brother. It is a story centring on relationships, albeit relationships within quite a turbulent backdrop. The violence should not get all the focus.Another reviewer mentioned tying this film to such stories as Reservoir Dogs; but I disagree. Relationships, made clear in the dénouement, strengthen this argument. One knows the background of Aniki, a violent and nefarious fellow, but his character, the character of the man, outshines what he actively does in the story, objectively speaking. His relationship with the superbly acted Omar Epps as Denny is touching. Clearly the highlight of the film.Well done, Takeshi Kitano. Well done.

This starts off as a forensic story (before CSI popularized that topic) about trying to find out who killed someone years after their skeletal remains were found. The story, however, quickly veers into Sayles' more familiar territory political correctness and preaching more about racial tolerance, more on that than on the crime story. As a result, the story bogs down quickly, and never really recovers.Sayles is like many liberal filmmakers, soothes his conscience, apparently, by spewing his left wing diatribes over and over such as always showing white people and-or law enforcement as hateful racists. Right-wing politicos are always been evil, and all minorities innocent victims (rarely, if ever, perpetrators) from these hate-filled Caucasians. You get a lot of diversity here and it winds up being more soap opera than crime. In this film, we get a good mix of white, black and Hispanic as the story takes place in border town in Texas. Another key element of the story is dysfunctional families, another favorite topic of today's filmmakers. They must speak from experience. Here, the sheriff thinks his father - also a sheriff - might have been a murderer. Those who love small-town corruption stories, where everyone has a million skeletons in their closet, should like this cultural crime soaper. The cover of the DVD or VHS make may this film sound like it's a crime story but don't be fooled it's pure soap. It is a slow two and a quarter hours of political correctness gone amok. Nuff said.
