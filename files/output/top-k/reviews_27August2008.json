Although I love this movie, and have since I first saw it, I must agree with a number of the reviewers on this site who have pointed out the numerous historical inaccuracies.Elizabeth I herself is superbly portrayed by the truly marvellous Cate Blanchett, who totally inhabits the role. However, the real-life Elizabeth was far more politically savvy and personally dominant than the somewhat easily-influenced queen of this film. The awarding of 1999's Best Actress Oscar was a crime against Blanchett, whose work in this film far surpassed Gwyneth Paltrow in the much lighter Shakespeare in Love.Her supporting cast are almost uniformly superb, from Joseph Fiennes to Christopher Eccleston to the almost-movie-stealing Geoffrey Rush. The latter turns in a truly wonderful, Machiavellian turn as Francis Walsingham; had he not also richly deserved his Oscar nod for Shakespeare in Love, this performance would have been worthy of a nomination. Allowed off his leash by Elizabeth towards the end of the film, he faces off against Eccleston as the treacherous Duke of Norfolk I must do nothing by your orders. I am Norfolk. You were Norfolk. The dead have no titles...You were the most powerful man in England. You could have been greater still, but you had not the courage to be loyal. So cut off my head, and make me a martyr. The people will always remember it. No. They will forget. Absolutely brilliant.The cinematography and set pieces are glorious, bright, colourful. In this respect, the filmmakers capture the essence of the Tudor court, its pomp and ceremony.However, if it is historical accuracy you look for in a film, do not look for it here. The film conflates certain characters, meaning that they behave totally differently from their real historical counterparts. For simplicity's sake, it seems, the Duke of Norfolk who lived in Mary's reign and put down the Wyatt rebellion (dying shortly after) is mixed with the character of his grandson, who conspired with Mary Queen of Scots to depose Elizabeth, marry Mary and ascend the throne as her consort. Additionally, Elizabeth's first real love, Robert Dudley, later Earl of Leicester, seems to have been confused with a later favourite, his stepson Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex. While Leicester was indeed beloved by the queen, both of them were well aware that nothing could come of it. Elizabeth knew of his wife (in the film she finds out from Cecil) from the date of his wedding, and although historians will never agree on whether their relationship was ever physical, the mysterious death of Amy Dudley meant that there was never the slimmest chance of them being anything more than the lifelong friends they were. In the film Leicester conspires against the Queen, while in life he remained faithful unto death, forming part of her group of staunchest male supporters, along with Cecil, Walsingham and Hatton. It was Devereux who plotted against Elizabeth, and he was beheaded for it. The other major discrepancy is the character of Cecil. Although extremely well played by Attenborough, he is far too old in the film. Cecil was Elizabeth's greatest adviser until his death in 1598, when his equally brilliant son took over his role. He is sidelined too early in the reign according to the film, as well as appearing far more feeble in comparison to Elizabeth than he really was.In fairness to the filmmakers, they do not claim that this is a true historical account of the early years of Elizabeth's reign, and as I said above, I cannot help but enjoy the film, as long as I do not focus on the errors! Great camera work, wonderful acting, brilliant dialogue - everything else you could need for a great film are here, so perhaps in the scheme of things historical accuracy is not the be all and end all...

The film's plot, such as it is, concerns the group catching a train to London where they are due to take part in a live TV broadcast. They are accompanied on their trip by Paul's elderly grandfather, and are constantly pursued by screaming girls (something, of course, which frequently happened to the Beatles in real life). There is some consternation when Ringo goes missing, and ends up getting arrested, after Paul's grandfather suggests that he should get out and enjoy himself more, but all ends happily and he makes it back to the studio in time. The role of the old man is played by Wilfrid Brambell, an actor today best remembered for his role in the television sitcom Steptoe and Son, in which he played Albert Steptoe, an elderly rag-and-bone man. In that series Albert was constantly referred to by his son Harold as a dirty old man; hence the many references in the film to Brambell being a very clean old man. In reality Brambell was only in his early fifties at the time, considerably younger than the characters he played both in the film and the TV series. The film was, of course, a great commercial success; given the enormous popularity of the Beatles at the time it could hardly have been otherwise, especially as it features many of their best-loved hits from this period. It was also critically well received at the time, and has continued to receive praise from the critics, largely because of its influence on later films. Leslie Halliwell credited the film with leading directly to all the kaleidoscopic swinging London spy thrillers and comedies of the later sixties. Roger Ebert stated that its director, Richard Lester, had created a new grammar of film because of its apparently spontaneous, mock-documentary style. Lester would go on to become a major Hollywood director; he also directed the Beatles' second film, Help!.The trouble with ground-breaking films is that, with the passage of time, they can come to seem of limited interest to all except cultural historians and obsessive film buffs. What does A Hard Day's Night have to interest the general viewer more than four decades after it was made? The look of the film seems very dated today. Halliwell's comment has always struck me as being wide of the mark, as kaleidoscopic is not the first adjective that comes to mind to describe a black-and-white movie. I cannot see any obvious influence that A Hard Day's Night might have had on the likes of, say Blow-Up or The Ipcress File. The film's improvisatory look probably had less to do with any deliberate attempt to create a new grammar than with the need to make the film as quickly and cheaply as possible to cash in on the lucrative Beatles fan market. None of the Beatles nurtured serious acting ambitions, although Ringo was later to give a good performance in That'll Be the Day. After making his only non-Beatles film, How I Won the War (also directed by Lester), John Lennon was to brand acting a silly profession. Here, however, the Fab Four are all essentially playing themselves in roles which call for naturalness rather than sophisticated acting techniques, and all four come across as both likable and amusing. The script is, for the most part, not great, and the comedy is fairly inconsequential, although there are some occasionally sharply witty parts that stand out. I particularly liked the scene where George is being interviewed by that dreadful phoney TV producer, and puts him firmly in his place. This exchange may have been motivated by a concern that the youth culture of the sixties was being deliberately manipulated for financial reasons. (It is also said by some to contain the earliest recorded use of the word grotty). I also liked the strangely poetic scene where Ringo is wandering by the canal. What the film does have for the modern viewer is some wonderful music. In 1964 Sergeant Pepper and the band's other more innovative work still lay in the future, as did long hair, psychedelia, drug experiments and transcendental meditation. The Beatles were not yet a four-man cultural revolution; they were just four ordinary Liverpool lads with an extraordinary musical talent, producing some of the most wonderful, melodic, heart-lifting love songs ever written. We do, of course, get to hear a number of these; not just the title song but also She Loves You, I Wanna be Your Man, All My Loving, and several others. (I know any serious Beatles fan will have all these in his or her music collection, but it's still worth hearing them in another context). As a comedy the film deserves perhaps 5\/10; as a record of what Ebert aptly called the Beatles' lovely springtime that rises to 8\/10.

According to sources this movie ignores the events that take place in part 3, which isn't a bad thing, but unfortunately most people want ignore want happens in this one too. We start where it all began in Amity with Chiefs Brody's wife Ellen (Gary) now the main character and one of her sons Sean (Anderson). Chief Brody has apparently passed on, but of course Ellen knows it was the shark it was fear of it that caused it. Could it not be the strain of the job and people never believing the man when he talked? Sean is now a cop and has to answer a call out in the harbor. Well not surprisingly, in a grisly scene Sean is killed by Jaws and naturally Ellen knows the shark had it in for him. Her other son Mike (Guest) comes up from the Bahamas, where he researches underwater snails. He convinces her to take a vacation and come on down. By the way if you think a shark has a vendetta for you why not go to the mountains instead, but no she goes to the beach. Of course the shark manages to follow her and get there before her in amazing time, also impossible. While down there she meets Hoagie (Caine) they have fun and Michel and Jake (Van Peebles) find out there are more than snails down in the ocean. They keep the shark on the dl and decide they can study it. Not surprisingly the shark eventually attacks the banana boat while Mike's kid is on it. Ellen knows its there for her so she takes a boat and goes out after it. Hoagie takes his plane and the others to find Ellen, lands the non oceanic plane in the water and Jaws makes his move. Don't worry Hoagie gets to the boat dry and unharmed. The climax comes with Ellen and all our main stars confronting jaws on the boat. Jake manages to put some electric toy in the shark's mouth, just before he gets chomped that is! But does he live? So Mike teases the shark with the toy's electric shocks which sends the shark jumping out of the water and roaring. Yes roaring one of the dumbest scenes in film history. Soon it comes straight for the boat. Ellen thinks fast, speeds up, (flashing back to her husband blowing up the fist shark, although she was not there) and impales the shark as it jumps out of the water killing it as it sinks to the bottom. Of course that depends what version you have seen. Take notes there are different versions.This is a really bad movie. A total insult the first two films which I thought were great. Its no surprise the Roy Scheider turned down the role, he didn't even want to do the second. The deal was even if he had his character would have been killed right away. And of course in titles like this they kill of characters you may like, for instance Sean the youngest Brody is killed brutally right away in the film. The story may be the worst part, but that's debatable. Ellen is convinced that not only was the shark responsible for her husband's death (heart attack, oh wait it was fear), but that it's seeking revenge on her family. Does she forget the 2 sharks that her husband dispatched in the first 2 films? Then it follows her down to the Bahamas and beats her there, oh please. Wouldn't this be a good time to move away from the ocean Mrs. Brody? Adding to that the acting is terrible in the film. I'm sure Michael Caine wants to forget he ever made this film, it's just so bad. If you can manage to pay attention you may catch the part when Mike and Jake talk about the shark, even though they haven't seen it yet.But don't forget the special effects, which are awful. The shark looks very fake. They were still using the Bruce mold from the other films, but this is many years later and it should have been updated and certainly not show as much as it was on screen. Upon sight of the creature you will be laughing at how bad it looks. Bruce the shark is rolling over in his shark pen where ever he is, like that little one in part 3. They also make the shark do laughable things, the worst being that it roars like some kind of creature from He-Man. Sharks don't have vocal cords morons. It constantly eats and chews on boats too, which looks stupid. Many times when it leaps out of the water you can see the mechanics behind what's it doing it. I mean really who put this together? There are really too many to mention, but some have to be. Hoagie after the plane crashes in the water and he climbs up on the boat and he's completely dry. You think we wouldn't see this? Also there are different versions of the film. When I was we lad and saw this I think I saw the one where they claimed Jake lived, which is crap because there is no way he would have survived. But soon talking with other kids at the time it became a war of words about he lived or died and that the shark either was impaled and sunk or blew up at the end. Its all bad&#x85;just bad. So believe me there are more than a couple versions all of which, not surprisingly, are bad. If there is a plus to the film, I would have to say the shots of the Caribbean are great, but that's not enough. Overall a bad film that has really cheapened the franchise even further, and should be an example of how not to make a film. One and half stars.

Upon sight of the creature you will be laughing at how bad it looks. Bruce the shark is rolling over in his shark pen where ever he is, like that little one in part 3. They also make the shark do laughable things, the worst being that it roars like some kind of creature from He-Man. Sharks don't have vocal cords morons. It constantly eats and chews on boats too, which looks stupid. Many times when it leaps out of the water you can see the mechanics behind what's it doing it. I mean really who put this together? There are really too many to mention, but some have to be. Hoagie after the plane crashes in the water and he climbs up on the boat and he's completely dry. You think we wouldn't see this? Also there are different versions of the film. When I was we lad and saw this I think I saw the one where they claimed Jake lived, which is crap because there is no way he would have survived. But soon talking with other kids at the time it became a war of words about he lived or died and that the shark either was impaled and sunk or blew up at the end. Its all bad&#x85;just bad. So believe me there are more than a couple versions all of which, not surprisingly, are bad. If there is a plus to the film, I would have to say the shots of the Caribbean are great, but that's not enough. Overall a bad film that has really cheapened the franchise even further, and should be an example of how not to make a film. One and half stars.

According to sources this movie ignores the events that take place in part 3, which isn't a bad thing, but unfortunately most people want ignore want happens in this one too. We start where it all began in Amity with Chiefs Brody's wife Ellen (Gary) now the main character and one of her sons Sean (Anderson). Chief Brody has apparently passed on, but of course Ellen knows it was the shark it was fear of it that caused it. Could it not be the strain of the job and people never believing the man when he talked? Sean is now a cop and has to answer a call out in the harbor. Well not surprisingly, in a grisly scene Sean is killed by Jaws and naturally Ellen knows the shark had it in for him. Her other son Mike (Guest) comes up from the Bahamas, where he researches underwater snails. He convinces her to take a vacation and come on down. By the way if you think a shark has a vendetta for you why not go to the mountains instead, but no she goes to the beach. Of course the shark manages to follow her and get there before her in amazing time, also impossible. While down there she meets Hoagie (Caine) they have fun and Michel and Jake (Van Peebles) find out there are more than snails down in the ocean. They keep the shark on the dl and decide they can study it. Not surprisingly the shark eventually attacks the banana boat while Mike's kid is on it. Ellen knows its there for her so she takes a boat and goes out after it. Hoagie takes his plane and the others to find Ellen, lands the non oceanic plane in the water and Jaws makes his move. Don't worry Hoagie gets to the boat dry and unharmed. The climax comes with Ellen and all our main stars confronting jaws on the boat. Jake manages to put some electric toy in the shark's mouth, just before he gets chomped that is! But does he live? So Mike teases the shark with the toy's electric shocks which sends the shark jumping out of the water and roaring. Yes roaring one of the dumbest scenes in film history. Soon it comes straight for the boat. Ellen thinks fast, speeds up, (flashing back to her husband blowing up the fist shark, although she was not there) and impales the shark as it jumps out of the water killing it as it sinks to the bottom. Of course that depends what version you have seen. Take notes there are different versions.This is a really bad movie. A total insult the first two films which I thought were great. Its no surprise the Roy Scheider turned down the role, he didn't even want to do the second. The deal was even if he had his character would have been killed right away. And of course in titles like this they kill of characters you may like, for instance Sean the youngest Brody is killed brutally right away in the film. The story may be the worst part, but that's debatable. Ellen is convinced that not only was the shark responsible for her husband's death (heart attack, oh wait it was fear), but that it's seeking revenge on her family. Does she forget the 2 sharks that her husband dispatched in the first 2 films? Then it follows her down to the Bahamas and beats her there, oh please. Wouldn't this be a good time to move away from the ocean Mrs. Brody? Adding to that the acting is terrible in the film. I'm sure Michael Caine wants to forget he ever made this film, it's just so bad.

Directed rather flatly by Stanley Donen as he was making the transition from musicals like Singin' in the Rain and Seven Brothers for Seven Brides, the 1958 film is elegantly mounted but a bit hamstrung by Norman Krasna's uneventful script. The problem is that not much really happens in the story, at least not enough to stretch the expansive talents of the two stars. While Bergman shows what a game farceur she can be with a sharp way of delivering a smart line, Grant seems more on automatic pilot as he applies his naturally debonair manner to a rather idealized character.The focus of the plot is on renowned stage actress Anna Kalman, who has not had much luck with men but certainly gets stalked by overzealous fans every time she is in public. Coming home early from a failed romantic rendezvous, she accidentally meets dashing diplomat Philip Adams. He's handsome, he's successful, he's Cary Grant after all. As an apparent beacon of decency, he admits to Anna that he's married. However, that doesn't stop them from embarking on an illicit affair, which gets stalled only periodically by guilt arising from the adulterous aspect of it. She is resigned to be Philip's back street mistress until she finds out he is not what he quite appears. This is where the film gets a bit more interesting even if it takes over an hour to get to that pivotal point. Simmering anger is followed by a petty act of vengeance as a punishment for the deceit that one character performs on the other, even if the basis of the deceit is well-intentioned.Then in her forties and coming back from exile due to the Rossellini scandal, Bergman exhibits a stylish self-confidence befitting a stage star like Anna. As likable and charismatic as Grant is, he only comes to life as Philip when the deceptions reveal themselves. Cecil Parker and Phyllis Calvert lend able comic support, though I never could buy the premise that Calvert and Bergman could be sisters given their differing accents. For the most part, Donen simply films the story like a play, no surprise since it was based on a moderately successful Broadway play called Kind Sir. If you are a fan of either star, you are likely to have already seen this bauble of a film. Otherwise, the 100-minute running time may stretch your patience. As part of the Cary Grant 4-Disc Collector's Edition, the 2008 DVD unfortunately offers no extras.

The Planet of the Apes remake is no where need as good as the original film. It was filmed by Tim Burton, but he really was just a gun-for-hire, a film that was not made with his usual Gothic style.Planet of the Apes is set in 2029, and focuses on Leo (Mark Walberg), a US air force pilot based on a space station. On the station the air force use apes to help do tasks and pilot small pods. A wormhole opens and one of the apes is sent to investigate. When it seems that the chimpanzee was in trouble Leo follows the apes through the wormhole. After going through it Leo crash-lands in a strange jungle and encounters humanized-apes. He is captured with other humans and sold to slavery. Leo is brought by a human-sympathiser, Ari (Helena Botham Carter), and with other humans escape from the city. This leads to them getting chased by the ape army, led by General Thade (Tim Roth).As I say, the make-up by Rick Baker was very good and truly Oscar-worthy. The special-effects were good, and there was some good action scenes. However the film was lackluster and really a by-the-numbers affair. There was a poor script with this film, and the story telling was nothing like the original film. There was nothing deep about this film and just shows apes as evil and humans as good. In the original film humans were neutral and all except Charlton Heston were mute whilst the apes were more of a mixed-bag. The original Planet of the Apes was seen at time as a satire, for example the backwards issue of not teaching the theory of evolution. In this film the idea of religion was decent, but could have been more. The remake was really just a chase movie. The acting for the apes was good and well casted. Helena Botham Carter is always good and Tim Roth loved playing the evil general. Michael Clarke Duncan was also decent in it. However, the human actors were not so well-developed and this film was not Walberg's finest hour. I also didn't like Paul Giamatti as an Oranga-tan slave trader, he was only in the film to add comic relief. The other major problem with this film was the ending. The original had a great ending which everyone should know. This film's ending was sub-par. I did not like how the battle ended and the aftermath of the battle (similar to my opinions to X-Men 3). Everyone has also criticised the plot-twist at the end.I admit, when I was younger I did enjoy the film from an action-adventure viewpoint; but even then I did not like the plot twist.

Such was the case when I viewed writer\/director Mathieu Kassovitz's Hate. Hate reminded me in many ways of Walter Hill's 1979 cult favorite The Warriors. Both films take place over a 24 hour period and both concern tough guy-type young men (a young gang in Hill's film) who must find a way to make it back home while avoiding trouble with the police as well as other antagonists (skinheads in Hate, rival gangs in The Warriors). While The Warriors was more action-oriented than Hate, the main journey in both pictures remains the same, as does the attitude of the characters. The characters in The Warriors, being gang members, are not good role models. Likewise, the protagonists in Hate, Vinz, Hubert, and Said, aren't the most savory of characters either. They constantly try to pick fights, argue, and insult each other mercilessly. This is where Hate encounters a bit of a problem. While Walter Hill is considered somewhat of a master with tough guy talk, Kassovitz doesn't seem to have much of an ear for such dialog. Throughout Hate, it seems whenever Kassovitz doesn't know what a character should say, he simply has them spit out a mouthful of profanities, whether they make sense or not. The routine gets tired quickly. Tough characters in films are known for having foul mouths, but there's a certain lazy and amateurish quality to the way it is placed in the dialog here. Kassovitz was clearly trying to write characters similar to those in Martin Scorsese's pictures (there are a few nods to Taxi Driver). It didn't work out too well. Half the time, the characters sound like a bunch of twelve-year-old boys cursing, like they only recently discovered swearing. At certain points, I actually felt embarrassed for the actors as the words in the script made them look bad. However, when Kassovitz sticks to his own sort of style and doesn't try to push the tough guy talk on the audience, the dialog seems more natural and clever. There's a scene where the three main characters discuss various cartoon characters from Tom and Jerry to Sylvester and Tweety. In that scene, the dialog works because there is a better flow along with a more distinct feeling of voice from Kassovitz. Another nice dialog exchange comes when the three guys attempt to steal a car, only to be stalled over an argument about who should drive. In this moment, the three come across as real friends. The argument itself seems real as it's a conversation that friends have with each other all the time. It is in these instances that Hate is a good film. In these moments, the characters and dialog work, bringing a strong sense of reality to the proceedings and strengthening the relationship between the trio.That being said, the best moment of Hate is one that doesn't seem grounded in reality at all. Throughout Hate, Vinz talks about seeing a cow walking on the streets except nobody truly believes him. Later, Vinz, as well as the audience, sees the cow walking. It's absurd, but also mesmerizing in a what-is-going-on sort of way. The scene could have been out of place and stupid yet somehow Kassovitz makes the scene work within the context of the rest of the picture. The cow makes for an awe-inspiring visual, one unlike any I've seen in any other movie. There are many way ones could interpret the cow and it is certainly symbolic in terms of Vinz's state of mind at that point in the story, but it works just as well to pretend that the cow is real. With all the craziness going on involving the riots, police corruption, and random violence, a cow wandering in the middle of nowhere surprisingly doesn't seem like a gigantic stretch of disbelief. With everything else going on, it could be possible.There is an awful lot that goes on during the 24 hours in which Hate takes place, so much that it would be hard to mention it all here. Some of what happens is interesting, some of what happens feels too familiar to be all that compelling. From a technical standpoint, Hate works. From a story standpoint, Hate could have used a bit more work. As it is, it is a watchable, occasionally compelling, little drama with a few nice dialog moments and some unique visuals.7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"27 August 2008","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Sometimes when watching a particular film, be it a good one or a bad one, it is impossible to get a similar film out of one's mind.

The Good, The Bad And The Ugly is definitely one of those few. Blondie (Clint Eastwood), Tuco (Eli Wallach) and Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef) are three men who are in search of gold coins that are buried in a cemetery. However, each man only knows a certain amount of information as to where the gold is and are therefore dependent on each other.The Good, The Bad And The Ugly is an incredibly suspenseful movie and will have you on the edge of your seat throughout. The action scenes are top-notch and really kick in the tension. The famous showdown at the cemetery seriously had me guessing as to what the hell was going to happen to the point of being wide-eyed and I'm sure that it's the most suspenseful scene in cinema history.Although Clint Eastwood gives an excellent performance as Blondie, it's Eli Wallach who shines as Tuco. The audience has a strange, ever-changing relationship with his character. At some points (mainly early on) we hate his guts and at other points we love him and can't get enough of him. He actually had me laughing quite a few times such as when he takes a desperate but brilliant measure to break free from his handcuffs. I won't ruin it for you, but it involves a train.Even if you haven't seen the movie, you WILL recognise its theme tune. Ennio Morricone's music is one of the best things about The Good, The Bad And The Ugly and its theme tune is certainly among the greatest of all time.The thing that amazed me about the film is that it keeps you entertained and interested throughout its three hour length. Films this long tend to get boring after a while and you eventually just lose interest, but TGTBATU will make you ask for more. Anyway, more to love.I haven't seen the movie's predecessors A Fistful Of Dollars and For A Few Dollars More. I've heard good things about them, but I have to say that it would take A LOT for them to be better than this cinematic masterpiece.The Good, The Bad And The Ugly is one of the best movies ever made and is also one of my favourite films.

The prologue is well done, though the vision Bakshi has on Sauron, Isildur, and many other characters seems either lazy in trying to achieve an individual look, or just ugly with no inspiration whatsoever.The acting is arguably hammy and corny. Sometimes the actors can do their job well, while other times things just get out of control in terms of what we know of these characters (be it from a fan's perspective, or that of a newcomer). The good thing about animation is that it can cloak a very bad performance, and had this been a film in live-action, each of the actors in this film's cast could face their own form of scrutiny in the way they voiced their character.This film can go out of focus a lot. Too much time is spent on wasteful minutes of a prolonged flight by Frodo from the Ringwraiths -- a tedious 5-minutes of slow-motion to show the wraiths in the Shadow world's view, and endless chase scenes. I laughed out loud when Aragorn tripped over his sword in the montage when the Three Hunters were chasing the Uruks. The battle for Helm's Deep is lackluster action. This film's version of Gollum seems superior to the one used in Rankin Bass's version of The Hobbit and The Return of the King. The writing for this film is all over the place, making it a pretty terrible adaptation -- even though some scenes are nice nods to the book, they come off as glimpses compared to the rest of the film. Boromir looks like a viking and Aragorn is wearing a skirt... need I say more in the lack of detail or attention to the character's Tolkien wrote. Treebeard is poorly realized, as well as Theoden -- who looks like he just came from a film about the Crusades.The music is pretty good, though is very forgettable. It's a pretty good companion to THIS film, though to imagine it to other scenes is nearly impossible, or poor in taste.Overall, this film is fun to watch just for the laughs. Bakshi did what he could in so little time, but ultimately, the rush in rotoscoping and drama behind the scenes gives the audience a lackluster adaptation of Tolkien's epic stories.

Watching this film, you certainly get a feel for Jackie's creativity and incredible ability to pull off some of the moves that simply no one else can perform. The sheer brilliance of some of his work in this film suggests that Chan never faltered from his quest for absolute perfection.Overall, if you're a fan of Chan, then you'll probably adore this film. If you're a casual Chan fan (ie Rush Hour, Shanghai Noon) then this film will surely lighten up your knowledge of just how amazing this martial artist is.

The only main thing is who is the devil, Kyzer soze. He is keeping his identity secret and playing his games right in heart of the underworld. He himself using 5 brave but misguided and frustrated young men by exploiting their weaknesses and compulsions. In the whole movie you will keep on wondering who is kyzer soze in reality and when u know in the end u will be taken aback and shocked , on the other hand u ll also praise his genius of deception and elusiveness. This film contains suspense with action in a far better way the stereo type action movies contain. The most inspiring actors are here Kevin spacey and Gabriel Byrne. Highly recommended , if u like movies , must see it. i believe every one can enjoy the film , it makes one totally absorb in the story , u ll always like to know the complexity of the characters in the film.
