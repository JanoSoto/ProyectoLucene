Of his entire body of work, only The Village and Unbreakable really stand out when originality is concerned, and they're really the only two of his movies that I've enjoyed. The major problem with The Sixth Sense is, who would have guessed, unoriginality. There is nothing&#151;minus the plot twist, I guess&#151;that makes this stand apart from the thousands of other kid-seeing-ghosts movies that came out before it. If you've consider yourself a horror fan, and one that has seen a good selection of ghost movies, you know everything that happens here. And I mean everything.However, there is some good. Mainly being that The Sixth Sense was one of the few groundbreaking American horror films&#151;and yes, it is drama\/horror, not a thriller&#151;that brought some weight to the genre. While the majority of horror films in the '90s just focused on cheesy scares, Shyamalan focused on fine detailed, believable, high-quality scares that made the genre cinematic and not just laughable. With that said, The Sixth Sense, like most horror movies, just isn't very scary. A lot like the original Saw was a thriller set in a horror universe, The Sixth Sense is a drama set in a horror universe.That brings out a lot of problems, however. For one, The Sixth Sense follows the same cliché formula a lot of Stephen King novels do heavy doses of drama, with short bursts of horror scattered throughout. That just makes the already deeply unoriginal movie feel even worse because it makes it very boring. The attention to detail I mentioned above as a complement is also a major complaint.Shyamalan's directing\/writing skills are both probably both at their best here on a technical level (if you ignore the unoriginality). There wasn't a single shot in the movie that wasn't effectively done, and the plot is laid out well. The plot twist ending brought the plot twist ending into the mainstream, and it's very well done, but still a little cliché. The plot twist has been used in a lot of urban legends before, as well, if I remember right, on The Twilight Zone a few times.So, in the end, it just left me with mixed feelings. On one hand I want to praise the movie for being so well done, but on the other hand I want to trash it for the lack of anything that sets it overall apart from every other ghost story out there. Everything was so predictable.Let this be a lesson to all of you who say a movie can be a good movie even if it's unoriginal you're wrong. Without originality, you're just left with no mystery, and just left feeling Eh, whatever. Didn't I see that before somewhere? And that last thought is exactly my final opinion on the insanely overrated The Sixth Sense. But at least it wasn't as godawful as The Happening, right? 1\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"1 November 2008","score":"0 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" I'm not the biggest Shyamalan fan by any means.

It is an excellent example of storytelling and British film-making and the old chicle 'they don't make them like that any more' is very applicable here.The 39 Steps follows the normal Hitchcookian route of an ordinary man thrown into extra-ordinary circumstances. It old fashion spy story, based on stories that were written before and after the First World War. The film also reminds me a little be of North by Northwest, with a similar plot, and also another good film.The focus of the film is on Richard Hanney, a visitor from Canada in London. In a Music Hall he watches from a man called Mr. Memory, and as his name suggests he can remember any fact and answer any question. However during the performance a fight breaks out and shots are heard. Outside the Music Hall Hanney meets 'Annabella Smith' and they go back to his flat. It is they Annabella tells Hanney that she shot the gun so she could run away from men who were chasing her. She tells that she discovered a spying plot in Britain they foreign spys were trying to get a information of a secret military project out of the country. Hanney is spectikel, but in the night Annabella is murdered and as she dies tell Hanney that he needs to go to Scotland to stop the plot. But as well as trying to uncover the plot and the mystery of the 39 steps he discoveries that he is the prime suspect of the murder of a Annabella and is on the run from the police and the spys.If you are a Hitchcook then this film is a must see for you. If you are a fan or thrillers or British cinema, again this film is a must see. It is an intelligence film and keeps your mind activities and keeps you compelled to keep you eyes on the screen.
