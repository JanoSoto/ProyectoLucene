Some have greater beginnings (Steven Spielberg), while others are not truly recognized and are left with a strong cult following (Clive Barker). For Sam Raimi, he has the luxury of both. Not only did his first theatrical film gain popular momentum, but it also has such a large fan base that it spawned two sequels and a remake, not to mention it made the name Bruce Campbell a family name. Sam Raimi is a lucky man, but I was actually surprised to see that his first film was not what so many viewers have praised it to be. For me, it was scraping the surface of entertainment.The Evil Dead (1981) story, written and directed by Sam Raimi himself is about five friends who decide to spend some time in a cabin secluded in the woods. Little do they realize that not only does the cabin contain a deadly secret but the entire area surrounding it is in need of some serious pest control. They should've called the Ghostbusters (1984),...oh right, that company was established three years later. Anyway, this dark secret has the power to unleash deadly spirits that can inhabit any host when read from a mystical book.The thing I found the most troublesome about this movie was the fact that for everything I wanted to give full credit for, ended up only being partial credit. For example, I found the makeup effects noteworthy because it made the victims of the demons look really supernatural. However, what I could not take were the voices of the possessed victims. Either screechy and raspy, or deep and gurgley, I would prefer to hear one kind of demonic voice. At one point, one of the voices sounded like an upset stomach. I'll admit that it did make the possessed victim seem more unnatural but it still was hard on the ears.But for a film with such a low budget, it does get creative with its practical effects. At some parts of the film, it even uses stop motion animation. One of those scenes is the vine-raping scene. Unfortunately, this is a particular part of the film I really wish Raimi did not include. It's one thing if the character gave consent for this kind of thing but watching a rape scene is a tad bit too far on the entertainment description. I just felt uncomfortable watching it. Why would anyone consider it fun to watch?As for blood goes, audiences will get their fill of grossness. It's not a bloodfest but it is nasty. Just nasty. Bruce Campbell's character can't escape having buckets of blood thrown into his face every ten minutes. But here's where I get frustrated again. What is Raimi's icon? Is it Ash (Bruce Campbell)? Or is it the demon spirits that inhabit his friends? For most horror films, the antagonist is the icon that represents the franchise but in this film, I can't figure it out since the audience will never get to see the demon that inhabits Ash's friends.Lastly, the score produced by composer Joseph LoDuca, (his first theatrical score to be exact) was half hearted too. I know LoDuca can produce good work because he did it for the Xena and Hercules TV show. Did he just not have enough equipment in 1981? The only two times I hear an actual tune is in beginning and ending. This proves he knows how to make themes in music. But besides that, LoDuca relies way too much on the strings to make any kind of music. And majority of the time, I enjoy the strings. The problem is that LoDuca arranged their music to create either scratchy or plucking noises. That doesn't create tension. Besides of the fact that they were only used for mainly transition scenes. The score was barely there to begin with. This was a project I was really looking forward to enjoying but instead for every good part, there was a counter. It's by no means awful but for all the praise that it's been given, I was expecting more.

I also knew this movie was based on a cartoon, but I knew nothing about the cartoon, and I knew about the movie first, so naturally I would assume that everything that happened in the movie is just like the cartoon, but I've read from other reviewers that this movie is so different from the cartoon. Since I never watched the cartoon, I'm reviewing this as a stand-alone film. This movie is really fun to watch; Matthew Broderick was the right man to play the title role, and he actually looks the part, I don't know why most people beg to differ, and Rupert Everett is funny as Sanford Scolex (aka Dr. Claw), and is sinister enough to get you invested, but the problem with his character is that he doesn't actually pose as a menacing threat to the society or to Gadget himself, he's more of a smooth talker. His henchmen are funny enough and they are great comic relief, but perhaps my greatest memory of this movie was the song, I'll Be Your Everything by Youngstown. That song is funky, it's a nice boy band tune, and it's good to listen to, but just recently, I found out that it's actually lyrically suggestive. For example the line, So just call out 'Go-Go Gadget', is actually, I can freak you with my gadget, hahaha, lol, yeah I know, dirty, huh? The Robo-Gadget devil is funny, and he could've been the villain throughout, but all he does is wreak havoc around the city.

I've only seen previews of the sequel, but that was enough for me to know that it's TERRIBLE!!! Overall, I like Inspector Gadget, and it's good for what it is, and enjoyable enough, especially if you liked it as a kid, if I were you, I wouldn't be so harsh towards the movie and just accept it as a stand- alone film. 8\/10.

I love reading them, and I enjoy being surprised at the end. Of course, the best mysteries won't rely entirely on a shocking conclusion. Witty dialogue, memorable characters, reasonable suspense, and most importantly, plot twists, must be peppered and laced throughout. The great thing about Charade, is that it takes everything that you could possibly want in a mystery novel, and puts it all under one roof.A young woman named Regina Lambert finds herself in possession of a large sum of money when her husband dies and leaves her $250,000. Unfortunately for her, three men are convinced that the money is theirs, and they're determined to get it back. With no one else to turn to, Regina puts her trust in a stranger named Peter Joshua. The two must now not only outsmart the three crooks, but also solve the mystery Regina's husband has left behind.Charade ingeniously blends the best elements of any mystery book, into a single film, creating an engaging and entertaining experience that's both intelligent and exciting. Clever dialogue and some quirky situations helps inject humor and fun into the production, while a handful of chase scenes keeps things exciting. With the added threat of three crooks living right next door, Charade is rarely dull.The romance between the two leads is surprisingly well done. It's a little overdone at times, but it's not too schmaltzy, nor too formulaic. It finds a perfect balance that few films ever achieve. The chemistry between the leads is excellent, as their personalities easily compliment each other. Modern romance films should take notes.The mystery itself is genius. There are several plot twists throughout, but all of them seem minuscule when compared to the grand finale. While many similar films often fails to provide much punch during the revealing stage, Charade pulls of it's big twist at the end beautifully. Characters are both memorable, and likable (or dislikeable, depending on intentions), with great acting to boot. Audrey Hepburn as Regina may appear helpless at first, but she quickly becomes an independent and brave woman, ready to fend for herself. Cary Grant as Peter is suave, but without being romantic. His maturity contrasts Regina's childishness. The three crooks (James Corburn, George Kennedy, and Ned Glass) are menacing, though not as defined as other characters. Jacques Marin as Inspector Grandpierre gets several laughs as the cranky policeman.The score, composed by Henry Mancini, is excellent. Often jazzy, but not without suspense and tension, it's a solid work from the master composer.A truly thrilling and surprising film, Charade is an extremely charming and masterfully made production. With a great cast, witty screenplay, and some great twists, this is the ideal mystery movie. If you're the kind that enjoys mystery novels, this is for you.

There are so many gems in this movie from the She's Your Queen song, the McDowell's vs. McDonald's shtick, to the preacher relating a bikini pageant to God's creation. There is countless amounts of funny humor. Coming to America stars Eddie Murphy as Akeem. Akeem is an African prince from the made up country of Zamunda. The depiction of Zamunda was hilarious, and I'm floored that some critics took it serious due to it making fun of Africans natures. First off, the portrayal of Africa is nothing like Africa itself and I think we all know that not all African women are subservient and are only interested in wealth. Yes, the African culture stresses obedience among other things but there is a fine line between being obedient and being subservient. Let's note that the portrayed is very fictitious, so don't get too serious about this. Most people who saw this film surely know that many African countries suffer from dire poverty, so some people might not find the story of a fabulously wealthy African Prince aristocrat going to America, not interesting. The reason for this is that Zamunda is based on the country of Zaire. Akeem's father, King Jaffe Joffer (James Earl Jones) the cap and lion pelt sash wearing king is modeled on Mobutu Sese Seko who ruled the country of Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo) from 1965 until shortly before his death in 1997, was one of the most evil dictators of the 20th Century, right up there with Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot and Idi Amin. The idea of a popular movie glorifying this level of theft, treating it as an object of amusement, is nauseating to some. Still the movie is interesting. Akeem go to Queen to avoid a loveless, arranged marriage and find a wife whom he can respect for her intelligence, non-materialistic and independent. That's so funny in a way, because how he misunderstood that by going to Queens that we will find a royal type woman. He will give up all his wealth and stand up to his domineering family in the name of freedom to feel disconnect in America due to the fresh off the boat misunderstanding of everything, and getting into all kinds of ridiculous situations with being an immigrant in America. Eddie Murphy's playing of the pampered prince was equally funny as Murphy manages to look smug and naive at the same time. I could easily understand his need to get away from the Royal Family and see what some other part of the world was like. Akeem and his sidekick Semi (Arsenio Hall) get mediocre jobs at a McDonald's rip off, McDowell and meet some interesting characters on the way. Characters like Lisa McDowell (Shari Headley) and her father Cleo (John Amos). Star spotters will have a field day locating Cuba Gooding Jr., Donna Summer, Louie Anderson, Eriq La Salle and Samuel L. Jackson in their minuscule supporting roles. Not only those Murphy and Hall play the two main characters, but countless amounts of sub characters in makeup. The make up on this film is amazing. Eddie Murphy was Clarence the barber and horrible singer Randy Watson. Believe it or not, the Jewish guy is also Eddie Murphy. Mind blown. Hall was also Morris the barber and Reverend Brown in the film. The movie was light and frivolous, just as expected. Gags were aplenty. The acting bordered on corny, but that's common in comedies.

That line STILL cracks me up! Still the movie is a bit overrated. I like it, don't get me wrong. Anybody who doesn't like it, is probably name Joey who like movies about gladiators. That or they too lazy like Leon to give it a try. I've always wondered why Airplane! or Flying High! worked so well whereas so many other parodies of the same type were duds. Now I know it just copied a movie call Zero Hour, the 1957 movie that was semi-actually good. Zero Hour's plot is about airplane that lost control of each of its pilots due to food poisoning leaving no one left to fly the plane. A broken down war pilot is the only one with experience, but he has not flown for 10 years and has no familiarity with aircraft of this size. Can he land this plane or crash killing everybody on board? Airplane! Pretty much follows that plot line. The spoof is the essentially parasitic form of art; it has no power but what it borrows from something else. Airplane works because of Zero Hour because Zero Hour was taken as a serious film. Airplane help launched the trend of gag based comedy in comedy movies. Until then, most comedy movies depended on character based jokes to carry the humor, with a few gags thrown in like Monty Python or Mel Brooks films. But Airplane went so far around the bend with its gag a minute by minute approach that comedies ever since have not been ashamed to rely on nonsensical jokes that broke reality and continuity. The reason why Airplane works while other spoofs fail is because it's not a Shallow Parody. Shallow Parody is when the movie produces a parody that departs too much from the original. Even if there is a lot going on in the screen, at less we know the plot is from Zero Hour. It's one of the funniest movies ever, killed the '70's jumbo jet disaster movie genre dead overnight like films like Airport and Airport 77. Surprising, if the movie were released five years later it would have received a PG-13 rating or R. The reasons for why it's PG is that the MPAA was still in it's early stages. But yes, Airplane! was rated PG and all that humor that was considered okay back in 1980 was not even close to a higher level so questionable for parents today (the poop hitting the fan, drug jokes, violence, the boobs nudity shot). All the character actors are funny. Robert Hays is laughable as Ted Strikers, the pilot that must land the plane. Robert Stack, the respected dramatic actor, playing an over-dramatic Air Force captain. Peter Graves as the original pilot of the plane who has something for kids in his cockpit. Lloyd Bridges as the man who pick the worst day to quit 'blank' who works in the flight towers with his flamboyant air traffic controller Johnny. The one actor that got a new lease on his career in this film was Leslie Nielsen. Today, he is known as the King of Parody due to his countless works on a number of parodies, but at the time, he was a straight respected dramatic actor. This was his first comedic role, and his launched his comedic career. Still, some people might not like it due to the humors being so corny, cheap by today's standard. It's more stupid than funny. Due to the years since the release, the film has become a bit a narrow parody. It occurs when the movie become too old, that producers might be afraid the target audience might be too young or just too snobby to catch the expected references, and have no concept of what they are saying. To me, personally. I believe this movie will forever stand the test of time at people will laugh at the simplities. It truly is a timeless masterpiece. So check it out.

I despised those movies, not because I don't like horrific flicks. Check out my other reviews if you think I'm a sob sister who just can't take it. But this is not a review of those films, so I'll proceed...What makes this film rise to greatness is it's portrayal of a man who thinks he has life, the universe, and everything, all wrapped up in a tidy intellectual package, and then finds himself doing and feeling things which force him to completely reevaluate the foundations of his life and faith. I can't help but think that there are many Christians who considered the subject of C. S. Lewis to be safe ground to venture through. Those who only know him through his Narnia stories, and the approval given for those films by their clergy, must have been quite surprised to find the man willing to break immigration laws to wed a somewhat bohemian woman for reasons of citizenship. I hope that those who first recoil at the truth of his life, grow as Lewis did as he faced the contradictions to his smug, self satisfied, view of himself and his faith. If you're a macho man who can't imagine himself capable of crying at a film, get ready to have the rug pulled out from under your pretension.

Only one song (Night and Day) remains, and he has a new leading lady (Ginger Rogers replacing Claire Luce), so for their second pairing and first leads, Fred and Ginger entered film immortality. There's plenty of silliness to be had, a few lavish production numbers, and yet all results in a romantic film that has gone on to movie immortality.The basic storyline has American attorney Fred Astaire chasing the girl (Rogers), not realizing that his partner (Edward Everett Horton) is the attorney in her divorce case. She's at first annoyed by them (he catches her in a precarious predicament), and he actually stalks her for a bit, but once they break the ice (with Night and Day), she begins to warm up to him. But when she mistakingly believes that he's the hired correspondent paid to help her get the divorce, more confusion ensues until the correct one (the hysterical Erik Rhodes) shows up with his concertina.Alice Brady has some of the funniest dumb lines in movie history, her malapropisms filled with innuendo. Droll Eric Blore adds more amusement as the hotel waiter with Betty Grable coming on for a delightful song and dance number (Let's K-Nock K-Nees) with Horton. It's clear that there's a future star in this delightful peppy youngster, yet it took 6 years before she would find success in lavish color musicals over at 20th Century Fox.As for The Continental, it is set up nicely, although I laughed more at the fact that Astaire had a pair of paper scissors on him and could take a page out of a magazine and make it stand up on a record player to provide a shadow for him and Rogers while they went out and danced without Rhodes' knowledge. The production number goes on forever, but is so delightful that it really doesn't matter, seeming more like a music video with its brunette dancers in black dresses and blonde dancers in white dresses.

There was love, betrayal, hatred, deceit, distrust and loyalty. The time period was 1757 and just 9 years later we declared our Independence and 1787 defeated England at Yorktown. A follow on to this movie would be April Morning where a young boy not quite 16 enlists in the town militia to stand with is father (Tommy Lee Jones) who is killed the first day on the Boston common. He spends the rest of the day hiding and firing at the Redcoats. Another movie that follows on to this one is The Patriot starring Mel Gibson. This takes place in South Carolina and concludes with the surrender of Cornwallace at Yorktown. For all practical purposes that was the end of the war but it went on for two more years until the English finally signed surrender documents in New York and we became a nation of 13 states in 1789. The music in Last of the Mohican was beautiful and intoxicating. It also played a significant part in the movie. One will thoroughly enjoy this movie. For most of the movie Cora Monroe was the stronger of the two sisters. However, at the end, Alice Monroe exercised great courage and threw herself off the cliff rather than allow Mauga the pleasure of killing her.

Unfortunately the economy of the mountain man era has ended in the late 1830's leaving the main character to wander the wilderness until he happens to meet a veteran mountain man (Will Geer), who teaches him the ways of the mountain man. The film explores the need that human beings have for human contact, in spite of whatever sense of isolation and alienation that society may expose them to. The film is also one of the first to portray Native Americans in a complex manner; revealing them to be something more than a white caricature. The film uses a powerful dialog, that while limited; is packed with deeper meanings that would be lost to many who watched the film. The limited dialog is carried by stunning scenery, which further serves to make a statement about loneliness and isolation. Add to this the bitter cold in which the main character is at constant battle with and the viewer will want to throw another log on the fire. The main character conducts a war of retribution against the Crow after they kill his Flathead wife and an orphan boy. In the end the outcome is left to the viewer.
