She's been on the island for some time, studying the animals. Ian accepts, making this more of a rescue mission (hence, the action star who checks his chaos at the door.)Undeniably, it quickly turns into how do we get off the island in one piece again, when daughter Kelly stows away and Nick's constantly trying to sabotage the other human inhabitants of the island from bringing the dinos to the mainland &#x96; San Diego. Nick's feisty efforts of saving the genetically, shouldn't-be-here-anyways, engineered dinosaurs does lead to chaos (full circle) and to people's deaths.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"23 January 2011","score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Let me state from the beginning that this film shows, on one hand, that there was a time when Kubrick's movies had a soul, a feeling--something they were losing along the years and of which there was nothing left at the time he made Clockwork Orange--and that he, once more, tackled here a subject he knew little about. And I'm talking about the French as a people; or the French military, the military in general. (I can't imagine any place, any country, where a general would behave in such a way as Broulard did in two occasions with Dax--trying to justify his decisions in front of a subordinate--or that this subordinate could give him such a stern lecture without suffering any consequence.) But let's start with the French.I think it's important to address the subject of the idiosyncrasy, the mentality, of the French, as radically different from that of the men shown in this movie&#x97;Anglo Saxons--to explain my lack of interest and emotional involvement while watching it. If you really know French people you cannot bring yourself to take POG seriously. Why? Firstly, the Americans--as Kubrick--are the kings of the black and white; the champions of the rather reductionist POV of absolute and opposed categories. They have the perennial tendency to separate good and bad, nice and not-nice, beautiful and ugly, etc. The French, instead, are the kings of nuance; for them everything in this world is relative, depending of your POV; and much more than seeking the absolute true, they love arguing about it. If you know that already you'll take POG for what really is, a film made by Anglosaxons for Anglosaxon audiences. See how everyone here is totally good or totally bad, there are no nuances. So much so, the only thing missing here is a sign over everybody's head, indicating to which group he belongs. And in the midst of it all, the idealistic, throughly courageous all American hero&#x97;Kirk look at my gorgeous torso Douglas--the only one who keeps his confident smile while marching onwards along the trenches, while all others cower and stick themselves to the dirt walls for their dear lives. That's not the French; that's not even reality but pure, unadulterated, Hollywood trite. We are invited in this movie...sorry we are taken firmly by the hand, and dragged if necessary, to convene that all the generals are awful, that they are a miserable and despicable gang of rascals, while the soldiers are pure, immaculate, victims. Maybe so, and maybe what happens here can occur any day in any country but that's not the point. The point is that there's no nuance. Maybe if this movie had been done by the French the plot would have been just the same, but to arrive to the execution climax many things would have have happened before; things would have happened that didn't happen here. See, the French love to talk, they love to argue and most of all, they love philosophizing. The direct, to--the--point, discussions we see her between Dax and both generals would have turned instead into intense arguments on the nature of good and evil, about the essence of duty in even its most abstract meaning; on the true value of human existence, and so on. The French love to talk about all those things and they would have profited of every occasion to do it, even the condemned men. Instead of that phony, contrived, moaning and lamenting of Ferol in his way to the sand bags he would have kept asking the priest abut the possible existence of life after death, or arguing with him about the same thing, or he would have completely lost himself in some Camus--like musings about Nothingness and the overall futility of human existence. What Kubrick presents us in his film had nothing to do with all that; the French mentality, idiosyncrasy, are nowhere to be seen here. What we got here is nothing but a bunch of Anglo Saxons taking a French story and playing it their own way. Anglo Saxons are far less expressive, far more stoic than the French. They are rather practical, realist, and fully anchored in the physical world. For them to die is the most horrifying thing that may happen to a human being; the end of everything, something to grieve and be sad for and not, in any way, to use as an occasion or excuse for philosophizing or for abstract discussions on human nature. That's why this Ferol moans so much&#x97;because he got nothing to say&#x97;and that's why I couldn't get into POG.Concerning the movie as a Kubrick work I'm not the first to mention that already here we start noticing his usual, future, trademarks the long tracking camera, following a general, a Colonel, in the trenches, for what it seems the whole 500 miles of the Western Front&#x97;and that for absolutely no reason at all. That's the kind of camera trick his fans adore--for some inscrutable reason--but which we, the no-fans, hate. Ditto for the moving around of the characters, for no other reason than to show us the sumptuous surrounding he wants them to be floating in--the best ex. of it being that first meeting of the two generals, which includes even a ridiculous dance around a flower vase and then a walk towards a mirror. Mercifully the scene was cut there, as I was fearing that at any moment both generals would embrace each other and start waltzing.Contrived, stereotypical, artificial--especially the waltzing party, where I could even picture the extras standing on their respective spots, waiting for the director's cue. Most of all, with very little French flavor in it, if any at all. By far the best scene and probably the most beautiful in all of Kubrick's career, the German girl singing to the soldiers. Sublime.

But let's start with the French.I think it's important to address the subject of the idiosyncrasy, the mentality, of the French, as radically different from that of the men shown in this movie&#x97;Anglo Saxons--to explain my lack of interest and emotional involvement while watching it. If you really know French people you cannot bring yourself to take POG seriously. Why? Firstly, the Americans--as Kubrick--are the kings of the black and white; the champions of the rather reductionist POV of absolute and opposed categories. They have the perennial tendency to separate good and bad, nice and not-nice, beautiful and ugly, etc. The French, instead, are the kings of nuance; for them everything in this world is relative, depending of your POV; and much more than seeking the absolute true, they love arguing about it. If you know that already you'll take POG for what really is, a film made by Anglosaxons for Anglosaxon audiences. See how everyone here is totally good or totally bad, there are no nuances. So much so, the only thing missing here is a sign over everybody's head, indicating to which group he belongs. And in the midst of it all, the idealistic, throughly courageous all American hero&#x97;Kirk look at my gorgeous torso Douglas--the only one who keeps his confident smile while marching onwards along the trenches, while all others cower and stick themselves to the dirt walls for their dear lives. That's not the French; that's not even reality but pure, unadulterated, Hollywood trite. We are invited in this movie...sorry we are taken firmly by the hand, and dragged if necessary, to convene that all the generals are awful, that they are a miserable and despicable gang of rascals, while the soldiers are pure, immaculate, victims. Maybe so, and maybe what happens here can occur any day in any country but that's not the point. The point is that there's no nuance. Maybe if this movie had been done by the French the plot would have been just the same, but to arrive to the execution climax many things would have have happened before; things would have happened that didn't happen here. See, the French love to talk, they love to argue and most of all, they love philosophizing. The direct, to--the--point, discussions we see her between Dax and both generals would have turned instead into intense arguments on the nature of good and evil, about the essence of duty in even its most abstract meaning; on the true value of human existence, and so on. The French love to talk about all those things and they would have profited of every occasion to do it, even the condemned men. Instead of that phony, contrived, moaning and lamenting of Ferol in his way to the sand bags he would have kept asking the priest abut the possible existence of life after death, or arguing with him about the same thing, or he would have completely lost himself in some Camus--like musings about Nothingness and the overall futility of human existence. What Kubrick presents us in his film had nothing to do with all that; the French mentality, idiosyncrasy, are nowhere to be seen here. What we got here is nothing but a bunch of Anglo Saxons taking a French story and playing it their own way. Anglo Saxons are far less expressive, far more stoic than the French. They are rather practical, realist, and fully anchored in the physical world. For them to die is the most horrifying thing that may happen to a human being; the end of everything, something to grieve and be sad for and not, in any way, to use as an occasion or excuse for philosophizing or for abstract discussions on human nature. That's why this Ferol moans so much&#x97;because he got nothing to say&#x97;and that's why I couldn't get into POG.Concerning the movie as a Kubrick work I'm not the first to mention that already here we start noticing his usual, future, trademarks the long tracking camera, following a general, a Colonel, in the trenches, for what it seems the whole 500 miles of the Western Front&#x97;and that for absolutely no reason at all. That's the kind of camera trick his fans adore--for some inscrutable reason--but which we, the no-fans, hate. Ditto for the moving around of the characters, for no other reason than to show us the sumptuous surrounding he wants them to be floating in--the best ex. of it being that first meeting of the two generals, which includes even a ridiculous dance around a flower vase and then a walk towards a mirror. Mercifully the scene was cut there, as I was fearing that at any moment both generals would embrace each other and start waltzing.Contrived, stereotypical, artificial--especially the waltzing party, where I could even picture the extras standing on their respective spots, waiting for the director's cue.

The terrible dialogue &#x96; including one of the most unintentionally hilarious scenes, when the raptor calls out Alan's name? The downsized special effects? The sheer mockery of using the classic original score to remind us of a better film? The idiotic reasons to get both Laura Dern back and Sam Neill as well as Sammy back on an island full of dinos? How about the Saving Private Ryan Spielberg tribute finale or was it Jungle-Boy? (More on that atrocity later.) Or&#x85;was it the insanely 568th zoom-in\/close up of the both the actors, namely Mr. Initforthemoney Neill, and the dinosaurs?Mercifully, the movie's only attribute was its 92 minute length. After you get past that sigh of relief and the regret of wasting those precious 92 minutes knowing all well you shouldn't have returned to the island with Mr. Spiralingdowncareer Neill, you have silly people running around doing and saying silly things making you wonder why this wasn't rated G. Heck, it was basically animated with some of the dinosaurs. Some that even talk!And what's worse? A character that vows never to step into the land of the lost-scripts, but sells out with the deposit of a check or an actor that does the same? What's that old phrase Fool me once&#x85;well, Alan (Neill) did make this very same mistake in JP1 but you'll have to forgive him though he was offered money, he was tricked onto the island of the dinos. Here, he, well&#x85;was offered money and was tricked onto the island of the dinos. How does someone of such idiocy become a doctor?I digress, he isn't real and this just further proof of poor screenplay writing &#x96; and from three different men, one of which I WILL NOT forgive Alexander Payne, author of excellent movies such as Election and Sideways.And speaking of poorly written Part IIIs, I'm sure it's already been stated this is the Jaws 3D of our generation with the coincidence of Spielberg directing both part ones of the series mentioned. Thankfully, in 2001, the 3D re-trend hadn't begun yet, so I can imagine this movie actually could've been worse with the use of 3D. Though they certainly tried to&#x85;with all those damned close-ups.I have NOT seen so many close ups in my life. Back in 2001, when I saw this movie for the first (of now only two) time(s), I saw it with a buddy friend of mine. We laughed our asses off throughout &#x96; yeah, laughing at it, but one of the things that were hilarious, though annoying, were the zoom in creatures, including the actors. This occurs roughly every 2-3, maybe 5, minutes of screen time. The last straw towards the ending when my friend wanted to put his fist through a wall in the fiftieth time they showed off their graphics of the dinos, the scene was set-up and was, once again another zoom in on one of the creatures. My buddy saw it coming and he warned me if they&#x85;if they do it&#x85; Of course, we always had the same response of whenever they did we would say to each other Alan? as in the first of many horrid scenes towards the beginning when a raptor speaks Alan's name to him&#x85;on an airplane.Anyways, I better seal off this review, though I am happy now that I've seen it, it's fresher in my mind to review it and now I never, ever have to see it again. The BASIC plot is idiot male takes Erik (Trevor Morgan, a.k.a. Jungle-Boy) on a Dino-Soar expedition of the restricted island of dinosaurs left vacant (of humans, supposedly) from JP2. Inevitably, they crash onto the island.In comes Mommy & Daddy, too inept to barely walk and chew at the same time yelling out idiot lines and gestures. They hire sell-out Alan to just fly over the island, but in reality, they're there to get back their son who's been gone for two months. Literally, after the AGAIN inevitable crash the movie turns to some odd-ball screw-ball comedy with all-but zero original ideas of how to now use the dinosaurs on screen.Then&#x85;Just when you thought it was safe to&#x85;wait, let me start over&#x85;Just when you thought JP3 couldn't get any worse, in comes Jungle-Boy to the rescue. And let's give him some credit he is one humble kid. After incredibly surviving eight weeks without training, adequate supplies, company, help or hope, his first concern when found Golly gee wilikers, I hope mom and dad are getting along!He swoops in (believe me, this had me and my buddy roaring in laughter in the theatre), saves Alan from the seventh near-death situation, who promptly has a very nice and calm conversation about Alan's books (again, see JP1), about how mommy & daddy are getting along while Alan unforgivingly eats the kid's precious final food scraps.At any rate, this leads to that, that leads to more of the same and the conclusion will have you, for the umpteenth time laughing out loud.Just skip the throw-away JP3.

I am a fan of his work, both comedic and dramatic. I always make an effort to see his films. In addition to supplying me with laughs, he also offers the occasional deep and moving performance in his serious work. So I am not coming into this review as a hater by any means. I just wanted to say that.Adam Sandler's first film, Going Overboard, was a 1989 release, directed by Valerie Breiman. It follows the lead, Shecky Moskowitz (Sandler), a struggling comedian working on a cruise ship. It is notable for its quiet release, and the fact that a whole lot of people don't know about its existence. It is also notable for it's exceptionally poor quality (being on IMDb's Bottom 100 list), and at times painfully unfunny jokes. I tried to watch this film twice before today. Once by myself- in an effort that ended after less than 10 minutes. And a second time yesterday with two friends, this time making it 15 minutes in.And today, while writing this review, I forced myself to watch even more of this flick, in an attempt to make it at least one third of the way through, so I can be more fair and just with my analysis.The film is sloppily put together. For some reason, Shecky almost constantly breaks the fourth wall, and speaks to the audience. Now, this is a technique that can work if utilized properly, but here, it seems forced and contrived, and it never really adds to the proceedings. In fact, it makes almost no sense whatsoever. They attempt to expand this idea, with other characters (such as his best friend) noticing the camera, or having other passengers (notably beauty queens on the ship) appear randomly to talk to the camera, but it doesn't feel natural. The comedy is extremely unfunny. An opening scene featuring Burt Young (how they got him in the movie is beyond me) makes an unfunny attempt at using porno-titles etched on the sides of video tapes for cheap laughs in a gag that is DOA. A barely animated opening title sequence tries to solicit laughs using a caricature of Sandler, but it fails miserably. Much of the humor is too drawn out, or too brief. And many of the gags fall flat as a pancake. An example that pops into my mind is a scene where we, for no reason, see the villainous character dancing on the deck in front of some sunbathing women for about a full minute while snazzy music plays in the background. It made no sense, yet looked like it was trying to play for laughs. I didn't laugh once. The most creative gag was Shecky giving a Bloody Mary to a patron which had been soiled by a seagull's excrement... and it wasn't even funny, just gross.The acting is uniformly abysmal, with Sandler alternating between trying way too hard in one scene, to looking bored and just reading his lines in the next. His rival, Dickie Diamond is portrayed as a lewd and vulgar comedian, and he's meant to come across as a bully that you hate, but the performance doesn't work, and makes you pity him and feel as though he may be handicapped in some way.The direction is unsuitable, and the film can't even muster the quality of a 70's television commercial in terms of visual aesthetics. (I have read that due to an error, the film had to be shot without vital lens and filter packs, which the crew had forgot, hence it's flat and cheap look.) There is no discernible story by any stretch of the imagination- reading a synopsis elsewhere, it is suggested that terrorists, thugs and other assorted villains will raid the ship later on in the film, but I can't see how or why. Literally nothing happened in the half hour or so I saw. The film has no guidance. The editing is also bad all around, and despite moving very quickly, it drags and drags... it's jarring yet also boring... It feels like snippets of a few dozen different skits strung together, with all of the punchlines removed. There's no flow, and nothing seems to make any sense, or contribute to any real effort at a story.Really, as much as it pains me to say this... this is the first movie I've encountered that I have been unable to sit through. It's literally painful to watch.I have to give this a 1 out of 10, and that's coming from a Sandler fan. It isn't the worst movie ever made... but it's up (or rather, down) there.EDIT (June 8th) I have watched another half hour of the film. My review still stands as is.

It made no sense, yet looked like it was trying to play for laughs. I didn't laugh once. The most creative gag was Shecky giving a Bloody Mary to a patron which had been soiled by a seagull's excrement... and it wasn't even funny, just gross.The acting is uniformly abysmal, with Sandler alternating between trying way too hard in one scene, to looking bored and just reading his lines in the next. His rival, Dickie Diamond is portrayed as a lewd and vulgar comedian, and he's meant to come across as a bully that you hate, but the performance doesn't work, and makes you pity him and feel as though he may be handicapped in some way.The direction is unsuitable, and the film can't even muster the quality of a 70's television commercial in terms of visual aesthetics. (I have read that due to an error, the film had to be shot without vital lens and filter packs, which the crew had forgot, hence it's flat and cheap look.) There is no discernible story by any stretch of the imagination- reading a synopsis elsewhere, it is suggested that terrorists, thugs and other assorted villains will raid the ship later on in the film, but I can't see how or why. Literally nothing happened in the half hour or so I saw. The film has no guidance. The editing is also bad all around, and despite moving very quickly, it drags and drags... it's jarring yet also boring... It feels like snippets of a few dozen different skits strung together, with all of the punchlines removed. There's no flow, and nothing seems to make any sense, or contribute to any real effort at a story.Really, as much as it pains me to say this... this is the first movie I've encountered that I have been unable to sit through.

","genre":"Comedy"},{"date":"23 January 2011","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" I am going to offer a statement up front as a prologue for this review- I like Adam Sandler. I am a fan of his work, both comedic and dramatic. I always make an effort to see his films. In addition to supplying me with laughs, he also offers the occasional deep and moving performance in his serious work. So I am not coming into this review as a hater by any means. I just wanted to say that.Adam Sandler's first film, Going Overboard, was a 1989 release, directed by Valerie Breiman. It follows the lead, Shecky Moskowitz (Sandler), a struggling comedian working on a cruise ship. It is notable for its quiet release, and the fact that a whole lot of people don't know about its existence. It is also notable for it's exceptionally poor quality (being on IMDb's Bottom 100 list), and at times painfully unfunny jokes. I tried to watch this film twice before today. Once by myself- in an effort that ended after less than 10 minutes. And a second time yesterday with two friends, this time making it 15 minutes in.And today, while writing this review, I forced myself to watch even more of this flick, in an attempt to make it at least one third of the way through, so I can be more fair and just with my analysis.The film is sloppily put together. For some reason, Shecky almost constantly breaks the fourth wall, and speaks to the audience. Now, this is a technique that can work if utilized properly, but here, it seems forced and contrived, and it never really adds to the proceedings. In fact, it makes almost no sense whatsoever. They attempt to expand this idea, with other characters (such as his best friend) noticing the camera, or having other passengers (notably beauty queens on the ship) appear randomly to talk to the camera, but it doesn't feel natural. The comedy is extremely unfunny. An opening scene featuring Burt Young (how they got him in the movie is beyond me) makes an unfunny attempt at using porno-titles etched on the sides of video tapes for cheap laughs in a gag that is DOA. A barely animated opening title sequence tries to solicit laughs using a caricature of Sandler, but it fails miserably. Much of the humor is too drawn out, or too brief. And many of the gags fall flat as a pancake. An example that pops into my mind is a scene where we, for no reason, see the villainous character dancing on the deck in front of some sunbathing women for about a full minute while snazzy music plays in the background.

A lot of people haven't heard of this film, and for some good reasons- it was a critical and commercial failure, seems to only exist as a cult film now, has been disowned by many of its stars, and for it's greatest offense- complete and total disregard for its source material.The games were essentially fantasy, taking place in the magical Mushroom Kingdom ruled by Princess Peach Toadstool, and teaming with the various other character who inhabit it (such as Toad, Yoshi and of course Mario and Luigi, plumbers). The evil King Koopa (or Bowser) will occasionally attack in some attempt to conquer the kingdom, but the heroic brothers Mario and Luigi are always there to stop him. That's about it for the story- it's very basic, very simple. It works. It's a tried and true formula. Just your basic knight-in-shining-armor-saving-the-day.You'd think something so basic would be impossible to mess up. Somehow, this film did just that.Directors Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel (apparently with help from several other uncredited directors) along with a team of writers brought this film to the masses. While the games were bright, colorful fantasy with a simple story, Morton\/Jankel completely twisted the entire story into a sort of dark-yet-childish Sci-Fi What if? about New York City and parallel dimensions and dinosaurs who escaped extinction. The opening scene of the film alone changes the entire set-up for the story, and within 5 minutes, you could easily forget you're even watching an alleged Mario movie.But I'll get back to the blatant source-material slaughter later, and address the movie on its own (limited) merits now.The film starts out with a flashback that theorizes that the meteor which killed the dinosaurs instead created a rift and an alternate dimension where the dinosaurs were transported, and able to evolve into intelligent, human-like beings. We then see the feared dictator of this alternate dimension, King Koopa (Dennis Hopper) pursuing a woman in our world, trying to get back a shard of the meteor- though it's never fully explained, re-inserting this shard into the meteor will merge both dimensions, and allow Koopa to take over our world. The woman drops off a large egg at a church, before appearing to die, while Koopa is sent back to his world. The egg hatches, and a human baby female is found inside.Years later, the Mario Bros. (although in this film, they are changed into adoptive father\/son figures), owners of a small plumbing business in Manhattan, are dealing with frustration with a rival- Scapelli Construction, who seems to be stealing most of their work.The baby has grown into Daisy, a beautiful young archaeologist who is excavating dinosaur fossils around the Brooklyn Bridge. She and Luigi meet and fall in love, and one night, Luigi and Mario are forced to pursue her after she is kidnapped by Iggy and Spike, minions of Koopa. They get pulled through an inter-dimensional portal, and end up in Dinohattan (or so I've heard it called), the other-dimension's equivalent of Manhattan. From there on in, it's basically a rescue-the-damsel-in-distress tale, and is more of a light Sci-Fi adventure than a true Mario tale.To give credit where credit is due, there are some good things about this film. For one, the effects are nice and unique, especially for an early 90's film. The production design is quite cool, Alan Silverstri's score is Mario-esque, and the visuals are generally interesting and fun to look at. The cast kinda, sorta works in its own way, and Hoskins\/Leguizamo are a ton of fun as the leads.But the movie also does so much wrong. For one thing, as mentioned before, the film totally ignores the games, outside of using character names. There is no Mushroom Kingdom (the setting of the games), all of the animal characters are now human, the brothers are no longer brothers, too much time is spent in the real world, they used the little-known Daisy character from the games instead of Princess Toadstool (Mario's love interest) so the younger brother could get the girl and appeal to the audience, Mario and Luigi's jumping ability are now the work of futuristic shoes. Nothing is designed to look remotely the same. It was like the filmmakers tried their hardest to do anything except make a faithful movie.Also, the film is full of other problems- a large portion of the humor is not funny. A lot of the direction is sloppy. A lot of plot points are poorly written. Dennis Hopper is pretty atrocious as Koopa. The rules are not clearly established. Etc. In addition, the movie tries too much to wink and nod to the fans- at one point, Luigi even talks about being a video-gamer. It felt like they were trying to make a movie about people who play Mario Bros., rather than an actual Mario Bros. movie... an even in that respect, the movie fails overall.This film was fun for me as 5-year-old when it first came out, as I had no real grasp on anything, and was wowed by the cool visuals. In retrospect, though, it's apparent animosity towards it's source material, and it's other faults are impossible to ignore.

The Misfits does look very nice and Alex North's music is beautiful. The script is thought-provoking and moving, Huston's direction is great and the story is interesting and well-told. The cast are excellent too, The Misfits was both Clark Gable and Marilyn Monroe's last films, and this film is an affectionate enough tribute to them. Both are splendid, while Montgomerry Clift and Eli Wallach also impress. All in all, moving and beautiful but falls short of classic status. 7\/10 Bethany Cox ","genre":"Drama, Romance, Western"},{"date":"23 January 2011","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" I haven't seen Dogma for years but was prompted to write something after being forced to sit through Clerks 2.I chose Dogma because it was the movie that plunged the nail in the coffin for me in regards to Smith's surprisingly successful career.I know Dogma is a big thing for Smith fans but it was such a hackneyed, lazy, low brow, self indulgent turd that I truly can't understand why.Did I expect too much after the hilarious (when I was 16) Clerks? In comparison Dogma is trite, forced, laborious and worst of all unfunny.The problem with Smith is, and this infects all his movies, he thinks his mundane observations on life can sustain not just two or three hours, but a whole catalogue of films.Clerks worked because it was fresh, amateurish, and somewhat fearless. It was the first time audiences were exposed to Smith.And he came out swinging - this is what I think about censorship\/porn, jocks, religion, love, the system. It was a movie about rebellion and this resonated with a lot of white 15-year-old males.But you can't make movie after movie on the same premise. Filmmakers are meant to grow (Cohen brothers) and take audiences with them.In this sense those 15-year-olds who followed Smith, and who he owes his career to, have been cheated. His thoughts on Christians (and I'm an atheist) are the same he had 15 years ago. Yet he still has his faithful followers shell out to see them writ large, every couple of years.His growth, or lack of it, as a filmmaker is outpaced by his budgets.

I'm sure sitting through one of his films is as frustrating and unpleasant for him as it is for me.Here is a filmmaker who tried to branch out (Jersey Girl) but failed catastrophically. This forced him to revert back to dick jokes and resort to Hollywood mechanisms &#x96; sequels, star cameos &#x96; to sustain a career. The very things he thrashed against in Clerks.He wants to be taken seriously as a filmmaker but at the same time uses gay jokes and bestiality to get a laugh. While this is quite obviously a sign of a director lacking vision or inspiration Smith claims these devices are his way of keeping it real, a kind of 'hey I'm still the same guy I was 20 years ago, success hasn't changed me'. Damn straight.And that's where my real annoyance with Smith comes from. If he just put his hand up and admitted to being lucky because he built a career off one film and now gets paid to do what he loves, I'd be happy.Instead he is a conceited git who tries to pass off his films as something more than uninspired garbage.I see his latest film is about a cop (Bruce Willis) whose baseball card is stolen.

I love Jeff Goldblum, he's gorgeous, he's tall, he's built like a God, great actor, etc. and I love Geena Davis as well. So naturally I enjoyed the first 40 minutes to an hour of this movie. Jeff Goldblum plays the quirky yet lovable scientist who is on the verge of the greatest discovery of the 20th century, teleportation. Geena Davis is the journalist who becomes interested in his projects and realizes it has much potential. They fall for each other, but her ex-boyfriend who happens to be the editor of her profession, tries to intervene. I found the first half of the movie to have a different feel, almost like a romance. But I knew that this could not and would not last just from the title of the movie. I love Jeff Goldblum, and of course enjoyed seeing him nude in many scenes, as well as in his skivvies...hey it's as close to full frontal nudity I'll get in this movie! Ahem, anyway, then the movie gets really gross really fast. Geena notices he has some weird hairs growing on his back. He becomes less mellow and very high-strung. She is not pleasing him sexually, as he can last much longer than she can (my utter fantasy, without the morphing into a fly part). He becomes stronger and more agile. Then the creepy stuff begins (if you don't count the baboon inside-out). He arm wrestles a guy until the guy's arm bone breaks. (Gross). He uses canes and his hands are emitting pus-like substances. Geena meanwhile doesn't see him for a while. When she does, he is utterly grotesque, looks like he was in an acid accident, and vomits on his food to eat it (I almost lost MY food while watching this, so sudden and disgusting!) Then she feels sorry for him and tries to help him. I must admit I stopped watching at this point so I guess I really have no place writing a review. I will say though, that i did tune in to see more horrific stuff, and if you've already seen it you know what it is, and if not, just read the parental guide on this website. Basically, he morphs into a humanoid fly to the point that he just wants to die (if it were me I'd have just ended it much sooner) and Geena's character shoots its head off with a shotgun after an attempt to reverse the transformation failed. It is horrifying, sad, and disgusting. It makes me feel so sick and sad inside, but the good thing is that it is so far from reality that it is hard to relate to.The beginning was more interesting and enjoyable in my opinion but I love to see Jeff Goldblum...like I said.' It's a classic remake, and it stands alone well without having seen the first one with Vincent Price.But it is quite intense and gross at the end. I would recommend for people like me to just watch the first half or so, and then be done with it.
