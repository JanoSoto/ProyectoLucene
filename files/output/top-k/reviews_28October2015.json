[{"date":"28 October 2015","score":"","review":" Nowadays, Wes Anderson's trademark style is well known but back in 1998 he was almost a complete stranger to movie audiences. It was Rushmore that gave most moviegoers their first glimpse of the quirky auteur's unique way with story and visuals.The movie's central character is teen Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman), a student at Rushmore Academy whose focus on extracurricular activities has put his scholarship at risk. Troubled by the prospect of leaving his beloved school, he falls in love with widowed teacher Miss Cross (Olivia Williams). However, he soon faces competition for her affection from middle-aged steel magnate Herman Blume (Bill Murray).The story may seem relatively simplistic but Anderson & co-writer Owen Wilson managed to construct a screenplay that was both unique and accessible. Mixing comedy & drama, the movie has its fair share of laughs along with a surprising amount of dramatic heft.The cast is one reason for the movie's success. Jason Schwartzman shone in his first film role and Bill Murray nearly stole the show in support. Meanwhile, Olivia Williams was exquisite as the female lead. Other notable supporting players include Brian Cox, Luke Wilson & Seymour Cassel.Wes Anderson's visual panache is evident here, though the approach is a bit more subdued than in his later films. Still, the film's look is constantly appealing and interesting. Also worth noting is the stellar soundtrack which concentrates on British invasion acts of the 60's & 70's. Especially memorable are the uses of the Creation's Making Time and the Faces' Ooh La La.Overall, Rushmore is a thoroughly entertaining comedy-drama whose uniqueness makes it stand out. Both well acted and well constructed, it shows a sophistication that is lacking in most comedies. Fans of Wes Anderson are sure to enjoy it while others will find it one of his most accessible films.

M was released only XXX years after it. Yet, in such little time, a radical development happened, which altered filmmaking completely. Actors could now talk. The silent film era was over. And oh lord, did Fritz Lang surely know how to use voiced cinema.This movie is a gem. For enjoying it, present-day viewers need to keep in mind that the public that was watching M was not used to watching in cinemas long dialogs like in the theatre. And probably Lang took many resources from theatre, but since them they have become cinema's heritage. There's so many tropes, so many pathos formulae and plot tricks that were used in this movie for the first time. It would be practically impossible nowadays to make a crime movie without borrowing, consciously or unconsciously, elements from M. From the public paranoia and the work of the police to the public persecution and personalization of the killer, everything in this movie has been reused over and over.Of course, the genre has evolved since then, and for being the first Suspense movie ever, it is probably among the most suspenseless movies I've ever watched. But that's not M's fault, it's just that contemporary cinema has made a much more demanding viewer than the one this movie is intended to. So much is that, that the movie can now even be seen as a parody of suspense movies; a comedy. There are scenes that are truly hilarious; some of it because they are meant to be funny, and others just because they are not something you would expect from a suspense movie nowadays (such as the crime organization meeting to discuss the issue of the murderer, probably among the most surrealist aspects of the movie). And the angry, expressive, theatrical German goes a long way in helping to make this movie funny.There are some thing that are quite unique, and that I miss in modern cinema. Where did all those theatrical dialogs go? Where are the contemporary movies with breathtaking final monologues, where the actor gives his best as if speaking to the theatre audience? From time to time, filmmakers should revise classics; drop the tropes that have since then become too overused, and be re-inspired by wonderful, rich movies such as M.
