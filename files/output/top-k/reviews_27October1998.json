So even though I have been eagerly anticipating this movie I had that notion in the back of my head. Well after paying my way in you should know I was pleasantly surprised at a very enjoyable film. The film was very artistic and even thou, as my friend put it, Kurt said barely 20 words it suited his character. There was a whole other story there that I don't think that a good many people picked up on. And there were the one liner's but the movie wasn't written around them, like most are now a days, it used them when appropriate. It is directed at more of a Sci-Fi\/Action lover group.. but it doesn't hide that. I think that a lot of people who enjoy artistic pieces will get a lot out of it too. I do however feel bad for Paul Anderson. But only because his last two directed pictures, which were both sci-fi, haven't gotten the cudos that they deserve. Paul your work doesn't go unnoticed. Also it should be noted that the majority of the reviews are stating that the story was to blame for its poor rating. Well I congratulate David Peoples for another fine job on this script.

While this is true, what follows is a well written, thought provoking and heart-warming film that lingers with you after you the lights come up.  I truly enjoy it when a movie not only entertains you, but also gets those brain cells working.  Now, don't get me wrong, don't avoid this movie because you want light entertainment in an effort to get your minds off of things, it can be that for you too.  It's just an added bonus that such an entertaining movie can tickle a few questions up.The general plot of the movie is that two teenagers, David and his twin sister Jennifer, are drawn into David's favorite television show, Pleasantville.  While this fulfills David's fantasy, it is his sister's nightmare.  David tries to conform and maintain his roll as Bud, but Jennifer just can't help but be herself, causing a ripple of change to spread throughout the town.Screenwriter Gary Ross who also wrote Big and Dave, once again creates characters you can both identify with and enjoy watching.  Taking you on a journey that is delightful and unpredictable.  If you liked either of Gary Ross' other movies, you'll enjoy this one as well.With the impressive cast, the acting is, of course, first rate.  Joan Allen and William H. Macy as the twin's b&w parents, show off the reason why they've been nominated for awards and Reese Witherspoon as Jennifer is intriguing to watch.  Though at first, Tobey Maguire is a little annoying as the squeeky-voiced nerd David\/Bud,  as the movie progresses, he really improves and becomes quite endearing.Now, let's not forget Pleasantville's incredible digital effects.  While the effects in this movie may not be as dramatic as those in What Dreams May Come, they are nonetheless just as impressive.  One scene in particular featuring Joan Allen is quite striking where David\/Bud helps her apply b&w makeup to cover up her colored face.  How'd they do that?So, after a summer filled with big-budget explosions and flying fists, Pleasantville is a refreshing change, and well worth spending the money to see on the big screen.

The acting was very good but the plot, which looked as though it could be very promising, was boring and seemed pointless for the most part.  I did notice they were trying to present a moralistic outcome but felt that the movie just wasn't funny, and dragged on too long.

I would probably use the word *contrived*. This movie contains just about everything that a rational human being should be repulsed by-> a cheesy soundtrack that lingers *to this day* on radio stations everywhere.-> a mass of Titanic zombies who keep talking and talking and talking about the movie.-> an embellished and trite historical plot based on real events.There is absolutely no way that this movie should have taken up 3 hours of your time, save the fact that it was so expensive they probably didn't want to waste one inch of film.  I guess they figured since you already know the ending, they'd string you along with overdone, poorboy-richgirl cliches and special effects.  Yeah, the effects *were* great (I certainly couldn't do them); I'm just praying for the day when it's finlly passe to even talk about special effects.Consider that DreamWorks, the company stemming from the little project know as the Star Wars Trilogy, had to invent special effects, invent the tools to invent the special effects, and had virtually no prior model to base any of their work (or at least techniques) on.  Today it's all old hat; who can write programs that render graphics quickly; who is the resident software expert; who can do the most in the least amount of time.
