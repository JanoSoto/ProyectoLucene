[{"date":"4 May 2008","score":"","review":" I really began to resonate when the beautiful Basil Poledoris score opened this film. The man is a musical genius, in my humble opinion. He can make a real turkey of a film into a much more enjoyable experience. In this case, he only enhanced an already great film.I approached this film with low expectations. After 'Water World', 'The Postman', and the perfectly dreadful 'Robin Hood  Prince of Thieves', I wondered how Kevin Costner could appear before the camera with a straight face. Fortunatly, he found the perfect script, supporting players, and director to redeem his career.'Billy Chapel', Kevin's character, is totally absorbed in his career as a professional Baseball pitcher. Billy has excelled at Baseball all his life. Unfortunately, he has mostly failed as a human being. Here is a man nearing 40 years old who has never established a stable relationship with any woman. He has been content to trade on his fame and wealth to enjoy the party scene whenever the loneliness of his existence threatens to enter his awareness. Somehow, the example of his father and mother having a loving and stable marriage never seems to penetrate his awareness as a desirable state for himself.We see that the closest relationships 'Billy' has are with his team mates 'Gus Sinski', 'Davis Birch', and the owner of his Baseball Team. Billy feels such loyalty to his team that he passes up more lucrative opportunities with other teams to remain a Detroit Tiger. When 'Davis Birch' succumbs to the lure of a higher salary with the hated rival New York Yankees, Billy feels great anguish at the loss of a friendship of a man who will now become a rival player.Sadly, the Detroit Tiger franchise is saddled with less than stellar players. The owner is unable to compete financially with the richer teams to hold onto his better players. Billy's buddy, 'Gus Sinski', is probably playing his last season. He is hitting too poorly and runs too slowly to keep his position on the team. Only Billy's intervention with the manager is able to keep 'Gus' on the starting lineup for the last game of the season. The owner of the team realizes that the only way the Tigers will become competitive is to sell the team to a corporate enterprise with pockets deep enough to pay competitive player salaries.Kelly Preston played a magnificent role as 'Jane Aubrey'. Here is a woman of obviously humble roots who has clawed her way into the fringes of the high fashion world. She starts out as a pregnant girl of 16 abandoned by the boy who fathered her child. Somehow she has been able to build a career and a home for her child. But mother and daughter both still long for a relationship with the right man to complete their lives. There is no mention of 'Jane' having any parents or siblings, so that part of her life is left blank in the film.'Jane' meets 'Billy' when he stops to offer help when her car breaks down on an expressway while she is starting out of town on a vacation. She resists his help at first, but he persists and invites her to attend a baseball game as his guest. 'Jane' is deeply attracted to 'Billy' and winds up sleeping with him on the first date. 'Jane' agrees to meet 'Billy' on his next trip to New York, but is deeply conflicted about the relationship. 'Billy' and 'Jane' continue to meet whenever his team is playing in New York.There is no mention of 'Jane's' daughter 'Heather' until late in the film. 'Heather' had a more prominent role in deleted scenes that would have made more sense being retained in the film. How 'Jane' could be going on a vacation in her car without 'Heather' is difficult to understand. 'Jane' visits 'Billy' in Florida training camp, again without 'Heather'.'Jane' and 'Billy' fall out after she encounters him with another woman in his apartment at training camp. 'Jane' finally contacts 'Billy' in desperation after 'Heather' runs away from home after a fight with 'Jane'. 'Billy' looks up 'Heather' in Boston and brings her home to her mother in New York. Billy' and 'Jane' reconcile and 'Billy' starts to develop a real affection and relationship with 'Heather'.I watched the film in disbelief at the stupidity and insensitivity of 'Billy Chapel'. On the few occasions when he actually took the time to connect emotionally with 'Jane' her face showed such angelic love and devotion, any fool would have worked like crazy to keep the magic alive. Instead he often stepped on her heart in his self-centered way. 'Billy' had to hit rock bottom emotionally before he would face the fact that he needed a woman's love to fill his empty heart. Why any woman would retain any desire to stay around after being hurt so often is hard to understand.The baseball portion of the film is very beautiful. We see how 'Billy' and his team of second-raters rise to the occasion to play the perfect game. These players on a team with a losing season determine that they will go out on a blaze of glory. On sheer willpower they frustrate the godlike Yankees in their quest to clinch victory in their division. The Yankees will have one more opportunity and will no doubt claim the prize. A heart warming scene in the film was when the rabid Yankee fans were forced to acknowledge the magnificent accomplishment of the Tigers in defeating their team. They knew that the ultimate victory would soon be theirs anyway.I suppose I love this film because it shows the power of the human spirit and that there is hope for even the most stunted personality to grow to maturity and find happiness.

","genre":"Drama, Romance, Sport"},{"date":"4 May 2008","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" This is by any measure a superior movie, yet it's hard to form any global judgment on it because there are several ways of looking at it.The story involves a small-town New England police official, Nick Nolte, who is plagued by personal problems. He's about to engage in a custody battle with the wife who has left him. He's trying as delicately as possible to handle his new romance with Sissy Spacek. His estranged daughter doesn't really like him much. He doesn't get along with his boss, not only the head of law enforcement but a Selectman (whatever that is) who is buying up local real estate in anticipation of building a world-class ski resort. Nolte's younger sibling (Willem Dafoe) is a professor in Boston and has little contact with him. His mother dies. His father, James Coburn, is a wretched and abusive alcoholic, the kind of guy who once had an awkward moment just to see what it felt like. And on top of that, a Boston power broker is killed during a deer hunt, the killing is classified as an accident, only Nolte believes he has reasons to put quotation marks around the word accident. Worse than anything else perhaps is the toothache that fills his day with pain. (I think it's a symbol.) He winds up yanking the offensive bicuspid with a pair of pliers.All of this tsuris drives Nolte up the wall and he begins to act half crazed -- thumping his little girl away when she knocks him down, destroying half his boss's office before being fired, boozing it up, driving Spacek away, ranting on about how he's going to crack the murder mystery that has been simmering in the background, yanking open kitchen drawers aimlessly then slamming them shut. When his drunken dad hits him over the head with a bottle, he retaliates by whacking the old man across the head with the butt of a rifle, as a consequence of which the old fellow dies on the spot. It seems (it's not really clear) that he shoots and kills the suspect and then takes off for parts unknown. The end.The acting is close to being splendid. Nolte has never been better and Coburn deserved all the praise he garnered for his performance. Sissy Spacek's role is relatively small and not nearly as flashy as the others' but I think she turns in the best job. Example. In the drab farm house kitchen, Nolte is shouting and slamming things around while Spacek sits at the table. The standard reaction shot would be Spacek staring in horror at the pyroclastic Nolte, shrinking away from his wrath, her fists curled against her cheeks, protesting, perhaps screaming. But no. She doesn't even look at him. Her chin in cupped in her hand and her big blue eyes stare thoughtfully into empty space. You can practically hear the wheels clicking.It's the story of a fundamentally decent and entirely ordinary man who is undone by childhood demons, a tragedy of almost Shakespearean dimensions.That's one way of looking at it. Another way of looking at it is that it is a simple fairy tale about child and spousal abuse by redneck men, and that abused children grow into abusive adults. We are periodically pointed towards this heuristic by the super-literary and overly sanctimonious narration by Nolte's distant and unhelpful brother, the big professor at Boston University. The murder conspiracy, the narration tells us, was all a delusion. The professor ought to know because he's the one who reinforced Nolte's conviction that the conspiracy was real. And -- if one were to stand back and objectively look at the way Nolte is treated in his social world -- really, some of his anger would be perfectly understandable. Spacek leaves him not because he has abused her in any way but because she seems tired of living with his drunken, lecherous old man, and because she has second sight and anticipates what Nolte is liable to become. Like the absent brother, she doesn't really offer much in the way of understanding or help, though of course she's only human. Nolte's boss comes across as generous but unpleasant, a mean and vengeful anti-smoker. And Nolte's little girl, the one he wants custody of? What an intolerant little snot! He takes her for a drive and offers to buy her a hamburger. She reproaches him for the offer. Fast food is no good for you. Mommy says so. She wants to go home. The benumbed Nolte offers another suggestion How about the Pizza House? Abusive fathers are one thing, but who put all that power in the hands of a ten-year-old kid? Does anyone want to live in a world in which little kids set the rules? Or overprotective mothers or people offended by a whiff of smoke and use it as a justification for demeaning others and demonstrating their own moral purity? Where does all that leave Nolte? It also seems unfair to the child, to burden her with that much responsibility. If one can get past the cumulative stupidity of that oppressive morality, it's a well-executed picture. I've seen it twice and enjoyed it, but I have to shut down half my left hemisphere to do it.

His portrayal of Vaughan Cunningham is simply superb. His performance was so convincing that I had no idea it was Ritter. I think Ritter was type cast as a comedic actor after his term in Three's Company, but he was a truly gifted dramatic actor.

The screenplay has some weaknesses, including Selma's character, however the visual creativity and Bjork's incredible acting performance make this a memorable and moving film experience. I have never seen an acting performance quite like the one Bjork gives in this film. It is unusual in technique and style, as Bjork is not a trained actress. Written and directed by Lars Von Trier, from Denmark, the film was shot in Sweden and Denmark, with the exception of one brief scene. This is because of Lars Von Trier's fear of flying. The story is set in 1964, in Washington, USA. Selma is a single mother of a young boy who lives on the property of a local couple. Selma works in a washbasin factory and is secretly saving money for an operation to save her son's failing eyesight. Selma is slowly going blind and wishes to prevent this from happening to her son. She has left her home country of Czechoslavakia because of the vision saving surgery available here. Selma has befriended the couple on whose property she lives and pays rent. The husband (Bill) of the couple confesses a worry and concern to Selma one evening as she confesses her secret of slowly going blind. Ultimately, Bill betrays her trust and sets up a very bad situation. Both Selma and Bill are weak minded and desperate people who will collide in a terrible situation of mutually opposing personal needs.A criticism of the film would be Selma's weak minded character put in a bad situation. Lars Von Trier has written similar weak female characters in his films prior to this, such as Breaking the Waves (1996). Some may not like the use of hand held cameras here, as in his previous films. There is also the unique setup of 100 stationary digital cameras used here, specifically for the musical daydream sequences of Selma. Overall, the film has the look and feel of a home movie\/documentary. As her co-worker and friend, the esteemed French actress Catherine Denueve gives a strong supporting acting performance in the film. Two particular scenes in the film with Selma, are two of the most heart wrenching and anguish filled scenes I've ever experienced in a movie. These two scenes are indeed difficult and painful to watch. Though a creative, but slightly flawed film, Bjork's powerful acting performance is what is best about this film.Film music by Bjork.

And of course, it's still a completely fascinating work fifty years on; with the dark ambiguities of the characters, the labyrinthine plot and the cold, claustrophobic atmosphere created by design and cinematography making this a bizarre and unforgettable experience that rewards on an incredibly subtle level. Unlike many of his other films of this era, Hitchcock is seemingly dropping the facade of his more populist personality; creating a film that is subtle, dark, coolly enigmatic and seemingly devoid of many of the broader, more tongue-in-cheek aspects of humour quite often associated with his work. Without question, it is because of this inherent seriousness that the film is still recognised and rated more highly than many of Hitchcock's other films - including those that did better at the box office - because it has something of a lasting appeal and those lingering questions of interpretation presented by the issues and ideas discussed herein.Right from the very first scene Hitchcock is skilfully mapping out the various themes of the story, plunging his central characters into a dark and dizzying whirlpool of abstract design and violent colour. As Pablo Neruda once said, the eye is the window to the soul, and here we see the eye of our central victim\/antagonist, transfixed and free-falling through an infinite vacuum that exposes her every darkest impulse and weakness. As the opening scene continues, we are not only faced by the on screen death of a character, but by a traumatic sense of emasculation, as Scottie, our supposed hero, is left impotent; unable to act in the way that we would normally expect a heroic, clean-cut all American of this era to act in such a circumstance, and instead, clinging helplessly from the gutter of a high-rise tenement as the man who attempts to help him plunges to his death. Again, a bleak foreshadowing of later events played out as infinitely as that opening whirlpool that predicts the film's continual, concentric spiral from one dark extreme to the next. The sense of spiralling is also one of the film's most recognisable themes and indeed, one of its most prevalent visual motifs, not only in prefiguring the continual image of bodies spiralling to the ground, or the spiral staircase that leads the character to the top of the bell tower and to the film's central revelations, but in the spiral into madness that acts as the film's primary concern.Another reason that the film does so well with cinema fans and contemporary critics alike is (I suppose) because it rewards repeated viewing with infinite avenues of interpretation. Unlike many other Hollywood films of this era, Vertigo presents us with all the essential questions and then asks us to put the various pieces of the puzzle together in order to find the answer; making us somewhat implicit within the story and the predestined fate of its character. It doesn't pander to the audience in the way we might expect from something as clearly melodramatic, but at the same time, it doesn't leave us scratching our heads and wondering what the hell just happened. We're free to interpret the film freely, but again, at the same time, there is a plot here that can be followed and a recognisable strand of melodrama tied rigidly to the central character. Like the work of Stanley Kubrick, Vertigo involves the audience and makes us feel clever (even if we're not) when we finally work out or own little interpretation of the dreamlike visuals and nightmarish shifts in tone.It's a dark film without question; one that Hitchcock playfully referred to as a love story about a necrophiliac and very much a film about love and death. The style is pure dreamlike abstraction, filled with overwhelming colours and soft, filtered lighting as the characters drift through the narrative like ghosts. However, beyond any such deeper interpretations, the film is still incredibly effective even on the most obvious of levels; presenting an interesting story that is rich and complex (without becoming convoluted or pretentious) and one that is rooted throughout to an interesting and multi-layered character filled with conflicting issues of light and dark, right and wrong, etc, etc. With this in mind, it is easy to see why Vertigo is still inspiring audiences and filmmakers half a century after it was first released, with its subtle elements of film noir mystery and romantic melodrama being continually contrasted against the darker notions of dreams and nightmares, life and death, fear and desire that all emerge from that tortured whirlpool that envelopes both the characters and the audience alike. Although there are probably other films by Hitchcock that I enjoy more than Vertigo - films like Rope (1948) or Rear Window (1954) for example - there is no doubt that this is his purest, most elaborate, textured and completely fascinating film.

The movie leaves you constantly waiting for things to finally kick off but the movie its mystery is too simple and uninteresting and you can see the 'big twist' coming from miles away already. The movie its storytelling is also just too slow and done in a totally uninteresting way. It makes some of the characters and dialog come across as totally redundant.The movie is made in an old fashioned noir type of style and way of storytelling and character handling. Yet however somehow this style never really pushes through and it's like the studio bosses said; No, let's keep this movie more mainstream. Director Robert Benton obviously understands the genre but it's like he for some reason is holding back or got hold back.It still has the usual noir elements such as a grumpy main character with his flaws, a femme fatale and characters that are not how they seem they are. It also features a grim voice over at times from the main character but yet the movie does not really breath a typical film-noir kind of atmosphere. It's still a modern made and looking movie.The movie is basically a waste of a fine cast. I mean when you have a movie with Paul Newman, Susan Sarandon, Gene Hackman, Reese Witherspoon, Stockard Channing, James Garner, Giancarlo Esposito, Liev Schreiber, John Spencer and M. Emmet Walsh, you could and should expect some more quality and fireworks. It however are still these very same actors that make this movie a worthwhile experience.

A movie that was made from the heart. The reasons for it? There are two of them that stick out to me.Gordon Bombay goes through one hell of a transformation. He goes from a drunk lawyer to reconnecting with his old love and facing a demon that has haunted him up to now. Even the introduction scene carries an ominous feeling. The goalie facing the young Bombay looks more like a menacing monster; as well as it should be since it represents a horrible memory for the man. I remember being scared of that scene as a child, just cause the goalie looked so scary.His character's transformation over the movie is the heart of this film. It's a protagonist who has a REAL arc - beginning, middle, and end. It's all carried out with such poignancy as well. Emilio Estevez does great acting.The child actors do a good job. I mean, they're KIDS, and this is a kid movie...but they pull it off nicely. The kids who play Charlie, Fulton, Jesse, and Banks especially. They make you take their characters seriously, which is different from a normal kids movie.The kiddy parts don't make me cringe, but make me smile. I guess because it's not overdone.Sorry to say, but the other two movies to me relied too much on either hockey action or gimmicks (although I DID like D3's grittier hockey action and more serious story with Charlie). They didn't have the heartfelt story that this one did. It's all balanced out to entertain the little kids, but Gordon Bombay's arc is one for the adults.I also miss the kids that would end up not being in the future movies.

The voice acting, once again, is flawless and the screenwriters did a fantastic job with the script.The humor in the film is even more effective than the hilarious examples from the first Toy Story. A favorite part of mine is when the rescue party out to find Woody, who has been stolen by a toy collector, find they have to cross a busy highway. Rex, after seeing a car crush an aluminum can, simply says in a laconic Oh, well, we tried. and tries to walk away. Like with the first film, I now find the humor, the animation, and the film overall even better than when I first saw and adored it as a child.To make a long story short, Toy Story 2 is a modern-day classic. It outdoes an original, which is miraculous seeing as how the original was magnificent and flawless. It is perfectly-paced, is effectively animated, never falls short on its entertainment value, and is a film I highly recommend for audience members of all ages.

Although I'm not the biggest fan of the majority of Tom Green's work, I simply adore the array of comedically complex scenes that came out of his mind and onto this film. Mr. Green simply took the 'traditional comedy movie' torch and ran with it as far as he could go, and thensome. Rip Torn is simply hilarious as the father figure, I don't think I should really quote any of his lines on this comment, this site is family oriented! Many people are very critical of this movie and I can fully understand their reasonings why, but I can't ride in that ship with those people. I know this movie is simply dumb, stupid, rude, lewd, mean and controversial in more ways than one. Well I tip my hat to Mr. Green for sticking his imagination out there in the public cinema world and not being afraid or worried of critical responses towards his work and simply being proud of his endeavors regardless of the responses of the millions of movie watchers out there. I wish I had guts like him, good stuff. Ten out of ten stars any day of the week.

If I remember correctly, it was also a big thing when it came out. I even had a backpack with a Velociraptor head sticking out of it for school. It was such an amazing achievement as a movie itself and the film is so wonderfully done that there's no doubt of why it has held up as long as it has and will remain the best dinosaur film ever created.The dinosaurs in this film look more realistic than any other prehistoric film, or even most movies today that try to pass off crappy CGI has reality. The acting was spectacular, and aside from how wonderful the creatures look and how vicious and exciting they were like no other dinosaur film had had them before, the plot and characters were solid and incredibly entertaining where you didn't think they would be so amusing. I will have to say again that one really huge reason why most people loved this movie was because of the special effects, but here again, isn't that an accomplishment in itself? Having your audience enjoy the film because of how realistic and fresh you are able to make it feel and look? I have never seen another movie with better effects than this one, ever. I am sure none of these horrible effects dinosaur movies that have been coming out lately could ever live up to the greatness of Jurassic Park.I am always going to love Jurassic Park for it's witty, unbelievable maneuvers and incredible screenplay though, as well. It was so properly thought out and executed, where most might have been expecting it to be nothing but high levels of adrenaline rushes with brainless action, which there was pulsating action, it just certainly wasn't as mindless. Many who dislike Jurassic Park really just have all the same reasons the average movie-goer would have for disliking a film, yet I haven't heard anyone fully describe and explain, well, what they truly thought were faults with this film, which gives me reason to believe that Jurassic Park is a masterpiece, for I, myself, have no faults with this film, except that I have seen other films that I enjoyed more. . . just a little more.

A wonderful combination of animation, live-action and CGI brings to life this enchanting story. This film has a host of great actors and voice actors to bring alive this film. Macaulay Culkin stars as a timid troubled boy, Richard Tyler, who fears virtually everything. On an errand for his father, he stumble into a library where he is soon turned into an illustration. The Pagemaster (Christopher Lloyd) sends him on a journey into the library's fiction section to find the exit and to face his fears.
