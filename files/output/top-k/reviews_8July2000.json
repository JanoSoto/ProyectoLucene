It was very intense and the effects were great.  The beginning of the film was extremely to long and drawn out.  The character development was extremely obvious. I mean you know the outcome of the film and it all seems a bit unnecessary.  Its like okay the girlfriend, mother, and the kid will all be sad because of their lose. If I hadnt heard anything about the story I would have known who was going to die by the way they portayed the characters in the beginning. The little boy, though cute, was a horrible addition if you ask me; terrible acting.  I almost fell asleep on the beginning, almost wanted to leave.  Then they got to the ocean and it got exciting.  The rest of the movie kept me biting my nails.  The antisipation factor was great!  Would I recommend it yes, but you may want to come about 20 min after it starts.

Arnold is good actor and he has great muscles, but this is not a movie where he can show his abilities. I didn't like director's or writer's view. There was too much 16 frame-shots. Too much 16 frame shots after another 16 frame shots. It is very hard to enjoy movie, if there is no longer shots. When Arnold did a shake, that was very bad scene. Too much different and short shots. And in the end of that film, there was explosives and action...too short shots again!And the Idea of film 666 = 999 = 1999...that wasn't good idea.. And that idea God not save us, we do. God just helps us to save ourselves... That is good thing to make happy viewers, but the Bible says something else...So, that is an american movie. Movie, which tries to make viewers happy... They tried to make new Jesus...There wasn't any reason why Satan crusifies Arnold...But..they wanted to do that...Okay...Good film, but no words ","genre":null},{"date":"8 July 2000","score":"","review":"  Arnold-movie...

You don't really have to think about anything from The Patriot after seeing this film.I do think the the film editor did a bad job because this movie was way too long for all that it was. There's only so long I can see the same battle over and over again but in different locations.Mel Gibson does a good job of playing the same sort of person he plays in all his movies.Jason Isaacs played his evil bad guy character with no depth. There was no sign of reality to his character, and you aren't haunted by any spark from his eyes.(possibly a spoiler)The best part of the film would have to be the first fight sequence between Mel Gibson and 20 redcoats with an axe. I quote  one of my friends , the matrix 18th century style. The Patriot realistically portrayed 18th century war fare but some of the battle scenes were copied directly from Glory.
