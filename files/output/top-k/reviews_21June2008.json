It's all the other details that usually catch my attention and make me admire the film every time I watch it.To start, the breathtaking cinematography. From the outer space shots of the Nostromo to the inside of the ship, this film is beautifully shot and makes the visual style a character too.Then, the characters. An amazing ensemble of believable people, even for a sci-fi movie. The interaction, dialogue and overall personalities of the Nostromo crew is probably what I like the most about Alien.The cast did a great job of portraying these characters. Characters that I find likable, interesting and entertaining. Kane (John Hurt) is my favorite character, despite having the shortest screen time.The story is, well, fantastic. Suspense and horror at its best. Subtle and well-crafted horror that modern-day viewers might disregard as not scary or the alien looks fake.The movie is a bit slow-paced but that's just part of the charm, methinks. I saw the slightly faster-paced extended cut and I gotta say I prefer the slower-paced original. That is what makes the suspense work. It's not about showing the monster do something scary right away, it's about building expectative, something that most modern suspense\/horror movies have forgotten.Which leads me to the title character. I couldn't have seen the film back in 1979 and I'm sure the audiences found the alien scarier then, however, I still find it pretty scary. Not just scary-looking (which he is, as well as cool-looking) but scary within the context of the film.Overall, this film is a masterpiece.

The characters, the nonlinear storyline, the dialogue, the costume design. I loved it instantly.I don't care how many people call Tarantino a hack and Pulp Fiction overrated. I will always praise this movie because I truly believe that it's an amazing example of great film-making and very original writing.What I love the most are the characters. Good characters can make up for a weak plot. Pulp Fiction doesn't really have much of a plot at all. As Tarantino said, it's the merging of very well known plots (gangster going out with the boss's wife, boxer supposed to throw the fight) but it's the way they're told what makes this movie so great.Anyway, every single character is memorable. Vincent (John Travolta) and Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) being perhaps the most popular. Even though is Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) who's featured in the poster. My favorite is The Wolf, played masterfully by Harvey Keitel.Which leads me to the acting. I think the actors did a terrific job playing these characters. For example, my favorite ever John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson and Harvey Keitel performances are from this movie.

No movie has had as much of an impact as The Godfather has had ever since it was released.The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.The directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection.The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable.The horse's head, the scene of Brando running with his groceries, the coffee shop scene, I'll give him an offer he can't refuse and countless other scenes and quotes from this movie have become a part of our culture. These scenes and lines have been recycled over and over again in comedies, commercials, etc. that it is impossible to avoid the greatness of The Godfather. The Godfather is like a disease once you see it you fall in love with it. I don't know if it is the greatest movie ever but it is definitely the most iconic film ever made.

Tell me a movie that has had more parodies spinned off its storyline than this. Tell me one movie that has been as quoted as a much as this. The answer is you can't. No movie has had as much of an impact as The Godfather has had ever since it was released.The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia.

The dream-like opening sequences are intended to endue it with a gravitas that is simply never realised. Likewise, the rather art-house flashback sequences in glorious black and white with a graveyard setting, all merely create confusion because their accomplishment is clumsy rather than deft. It would have been far simpler, better, and less confusing to have taken the straightforward approach with a solid, logical 'rescue' movie like 'Aliens' - which it very much resembles - and sort out the conspiracy later.Once we finally know what is going on, the story gets into its stride. Set pieces are excellent and the pacing and revelations likewise. There are lots of strange-sinister environments - again, like alien\/aliens - that leave you guessing what might turn up.What actually turns up is every cliché known to horror movies. There are - Zombies! And they're - flesh-eaters! It has never been explained ever, since the 'Living Dead' franchise why zombies are so picky. They won't so much as nibble each other, but give them a living human and they fall upon it like wolves. Why? protein is protein, after all.There's also a chamber of horrors into which most of the commando team blunder only to get wiped-out - once again, like 'Aliens'. But there's also a hint of 'Cube' about it, because this really is a booby-trap, and people get diced in much the same way.There's a malevolent computer like Hal of '2001', which needs to be shut down before it kills everybody. There's a deadly virus (where would we be without a deadly virus?) that also turns people into zombie flesh-eaters. There's even a pack of zombie dogs, that appear to have lost all of their hair for some unexplained reason. It makes them look more ghastly - and that's probably the reason.On top of all this, there's a really shocking beastie with big claws and a very long tongue - 'Journey To The Centre Of The Earth' (1957) - popping-up there, by the looks of it. And there's a riotous train ride with the villain on board, not so far removed from 'The Wrong Trousers'.And, last but not least; the mission is time-sensitive. So we all know the clock is ticking...If they don't get their arses into gear, they suffer a permanent lock-in - rather like 'The Crystal Maze'.The cast are about as unmemorable a bunch of players as ever graced a B-movie. Apart from the blonde communist typing-error, Jovovich, none of them register a single point on the Richter-scale of acting ability. An Hispanic female (called Rodriguez, would you believe) suffers from some strange opthalmic condition whereby she is permanently looking upwards. It is not a very endearing characteristic. Whilst Ms Jovovich's high point was to fall through the roof of you-know-who's taxi in 'Fifth Element'. One suspects that she must have fallen onto numerous casting-couches first. Frankly, I have seen more human emotion expressed by a pair of buttocks than I have seen manifest in her face. That blank, pale, uncomprehending stare has now become a staple at the check-out queue of my local Tesco's.

Aside from Stanley Kubrick's Cold War farce 'Dr. Strangelove&#133; (1964),' Richard Lester's 'A Hard Day's Night (1964)' and the various works of the Billy Wilder, most of the comedy I've seen from this era has been over-stylish, dated and campy. Take, for example, the second Beatles movie, 'Help! (1965),' which deviated so far from the intelligent wit of the first film that I could only stare in a mixture of horror and disbelief (at least the soundtrack was enjoyable). Blake Edwards' 'The Pink Panther (1963)' was my first film from the director, and, though Peter Sellers was, of course, hilarious as the bumbling Inspector Clouseau, the film itself was a very uneven affair. So I must confess that I approached 'The Party (1968)' with some trepidation. The theatrical trailer screamed 1960s! at the top of its voice, and I deduced that the film would be considerably hampered by an out-dated style that diluted whatever comedy there had once been. Perhaps low expectations are a good thing to have, since I instead found myself pleasantly surprised.Peter Sellers is often held to be cinema's most accomplished comedians, and I can see no reason why this should not be the case. He was an extraordinary chameleon when the role called for it, and no actor ever milked so many laughs from his manipulation of cultural stereotypes, whether that be his fascist German from 'Dr. Strangelove&#133;,' his bumbling Frenchman from 'The Pink Panther,' his vocabulary-challenged Chinese detective from 'Murder by Death (1976)' or this film's good-natured Indian. Of course, it takes a few moments for you to accept such a well-known actor as an Indian, but, by the film's end, it doesn't seem unusual in the slightest. Sellers plays Hrundi V. Bakshi as an affable outsider, completely out-of-his-depth at such an upper-class get-together. Despite his occasionally tendency to be rather clumsy, he eventually earns the respect of the other party-goers, especially beautiful actress Michele Monet (Claudine Longet), through his kindness and indomitable sense of fun.'The Party' was largely improvised from a rudimentary 56-60 page screenplay, and it really does show. There is nothing exceptional about the dialogue, and, though Bakshi gets one or two memorable catch-phrases (Birdie Num Num!), the bulk of the humour is purely visual. There was always going to be a risk in extending a single party throughout a 99-minute running-time, and the end result is rather interesting. Between gags, particularly during the dinner sequence, there is a curious sense of vacuousness, and Edwards indulges in an extended period of idleness that no comedy director today would ever be bold enough to leave intact. In one way, this approach is somewhat reassuring; the director is obviously completely comfortable with what he is doing. On the other hand, you wonder if the story is merely stalling itself, in order to consume enough celluloid to make a respectable feature-length. In any case, despite my adverse expectations, 'The Party' turned out to be an adequately funny and even touching comedy, in no small part due to the magnificent talents of its leading man&#133;whatever nationality he might be.

Thankfully, this time both characters were very interesting and had pretty good chemistry, as opposed to Mallrats in which Jason Lee did pretty much all the work while Jeremy London didn't help.Joey Lauren Adams was great. I haven't seen her in much else but she really fit the role of Alyssa Jones, and the chemistry between her and Affleck worked decently.Dwight Ewell was also great as Hooper. Very funny and well-written for such a small role.The writing is good. Smith's dialogue is as good as usual. Very funny in moments, and while I think the dramatic parts weren't a strong point, it's far from bad.Acting-wise, Lee, Adams and Ewell are perfect in their roles. Affleck, well, he was believable enough but he's definitely the weakest link. Especially in scenes with just him and Jason Lee, you can tell that Lee is submerged in the character while Affleck seems to be trying hard to sound dramatic. Still, it's not a big complaint and Affleck's acting doesn't ruin the movie or anything like that. It helps that his character is sympathetic, though.Chasing Amy is my third favorite Kevin Smith movie (behind Clerks and the sequel) and a very good movie overall.

Tim Burton is a master of this genre, and he uses his skills with special effects to give some really effective scenes involving the Headless Horseman chasing down people and taking their heads. What is different about Washington Irving's legend is the story. Burton takes the famed character Ichabod Crane, and turns him from a gangly, unsightly school teacher to a mild-mannered, handsome constable who wants to use modern-day techniques to discover murderers and cause of death. Johnny Depp is very good, as usual, playing Crane as a smart intellectual who sometimes lets his fears and emotions get in the way of his work. Christina Ricci is good as well, but looks to be about only 12 here. What doesn't work here, like many of Burton's films, is the story. The opening quarter is very scary and suspenseful and pulls you right in. The last fifteen minutes or so really drop off and don't really take the audience any further. I was expecting a bigger twist here, since this is done by the man who wrote Se7ven. Still, this is a scary thrill-ride that feeds the emotions but not the brain. If only Burton would start doing that, he might be one of the best in Hollywood instead of one of the better.

At this point, nothing(or infinitely, insignificantly little) remains real in these movies. That, in itself, doesn't have to be a problem. But we can tell. It doesn't feel right. Sin City doesn't have this problem, nor does 300. The effects are, technically speaking, amazing, but nothing else in this really goes beyond being decent. The romance lacks credibility(and yes, I am aware that some of it was left on the cutting room floor, but we're going by the finished product, not the intent). The overall story... well, Lucas gives many fans something they may have wanted in spite of there being absolutely no basis for it, and sacrifices it making sense in doing so. This tries too hard to tie in with the OT(which, I should point out so that no one mistakes me for someone who grew up with it, I didn't attentively view until Episode I was out). The dialog gets to be downright painful, with one even contradicting something in the first(written by the same guy, a few years earlier...!). The plot isn't that engaging, and things that ought to be in the next are here(and vice versa). The pacing is reasonable. The light-saber bits could be considerably better(they are particularly unimpressive compared to Phantom Menace), and at times, it's the tamest it's been since Return, although it isn't all bad. The action in general, mostly, it's just overdone, and goes on for too long. There are cool ideas and concepts, but their lackluster execution results in them merely being unable to be used soon by more talented film-makers. The title could be that of a 50's schlocky sci-fi flick. The battles do have notable, interesting aspects... in the editing and cinematography, mainly. The actors have put in solid performances elsewhere, or, at least, less embarrassing ones. Characters could stand improvement, and, you know, consistency. The score is still good.

Their personalities are so different, yet they manage to have some of the best chemistry I've seen screen buddies have.I read the script before watching the movie, and while I really liked it, it's the actors that add that extra realism and feeling to the characters.Brian O'Halloran's Dante Hicks is perhaps my favorite character. Yes, he's the straight man, he's not very funny, he's frustrated and upset throughout most of the movie, but he's just so real. Being the serious guy in a comedy is not easy, mostly because you're probably gonna be labeled as the boring or not so funny guy. Dante Hicks is one of the most relatable characters I've ever seen.

I don't think Randal could be a leading man, and I think he wouldn't be as popular, funny, or cool without Dante. The two characters compliment each other so well.

The actors are good enough, but no stand outs. The relationship between the REDFORD character and the DUNNAWAY character does not work at ALL. It's a terrible mess and doesn't make any sense what so ever. Relationships like that could only happen in the movies. Oh, this IS a movie!!

Then Redford kills the mailman and off Dunaway and Redford go. What? What happens to the apartment? How is it cleaned up and fixed. What about the land lord? Most important, what about the damn body??? Does it just lay there forever. Who gets rid of it. What would Dunnaway say to the police? Does she just take off to Vermont to be with her boyfriend? What's going to be her explanation? Again, what about that BODY? The plot is so convoluted you can't tell the players without a program. Why were the people in the office killed? Never satisfactory explained, unless I missed something. Was the Cliff Robertson character good or bad? WHO was good and bad exactly? Terrible ending with too much left in the air.Having said all this, it's still a watchable film, expertly photogrpahed with real locations and some interesting scenes. Worth a look, but not worth much praise.

The actors are good enough, but no stand outs. The relationship between the REDFORD character and the DUNNAWAY character does not work at ALL. It's a terrible mess and doesn't make any sense what so ever. Relationships like that could only happen in the movies. Oh, this IS a movie!!

On a personal level, this is the first movie I ever truly fell in complete love with as a child. On a technical level, Nightmare is really an achievement because making a 76 minute film with claymation in 1993 probably was a nightmare comparable to what the production crew of Jaws faced. On a musical level, this is the best movie-musical of all time, in my opinion. Danny Elfman's score is one of the best ever written. Also, this is a milestone film in terms of story and characters. If Nightmare were filmed in live-time without the music, it wouldn't have the magic that put it #3 on my list, but it would still be a well developed, quirky story. As I say in every review, the most important part of film a film is its character development and its finale. Henry Selick and Tim Burton take characters that seem very unlikeable and make them personable. I actually think that the humble love story between Jack and Sally is the most romantic love story in film history. It's innocent. The entire film is innocent. A child could sit down and appreciate this film as I did, or an adult could do the same. It's colorful in a literal sense and a figurative sense. Also, Nightmare has the greatest opening sequence of all time, in my opinion. This is Halloween is undeniably creepy, and all of our Halloween archetypes spring to life before our eyes, promising an exciting hour and 15 minutes. Boogie is one of the most delicious villains of all time. He's just so rotten, you have to love him. His song with Santa Claus is priceless--there's something about the boogeyman singing a jazz number to Santa Claus that fills me with glee. Despite the darkness of the Halloween theme, Burton and Selick bring unimaginable beauty to the screen. Christmas town is straight from a child's (or Tim Burton's) dreams. The ending is also beautiful, but we won't talk about that in a review. The whole point of going to the films is to be taken somewhere that you can't really go. If there ever were a film that does that, this is it.
