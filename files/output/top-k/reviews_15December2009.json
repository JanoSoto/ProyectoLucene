ANNIE HALL - unlike most Woody Allen films - was also a box-office hit across the country (despite his international reputation, most Allen films just don't play in the USA outside the coastal cities, but they are usually so inexpensive to produce that Allen easily makes back his costs nevertheless). Being in such a position, Allen could do anything he wanted as a follow-up, so he chose a project which was very dear to his heart and which wound up disappointing just about everyone and became something of a joke for a long time afterward - a phenomenon so widespread it was referenced by Allen himself in 1980's STARDUST MEMORIES when a character says to the Allen stand-in - I liked your early, funny, movies! INTERIORS violated audience expectations because it is not a comedy and Allen isn't in it (thank God), both of which were firsts in Allen's long career. Believe me, there is nevertheless a lot of humour in INTERIORS - but it is of the unintentionally funny kind, as we will see later...The film in fact slipped through something of a crack in UA's production schedule - preoccupied at the time with Cimino's out-of-control epic HEAVEN'S GATE, the money men trusted Allen and allowed him to do as he wished, but the box-office failure of INTERIORS was in its day thought to be just another example of a self-indulgent director getting his comeuppance and the film became another nail in the financial coffin which destroyed the only remaining major independent studio in Hollywood. Thirty years later, INTERIORS has perhaps finally gained the public recognition it deserves as one of Allen's richest, most rewarding and beautiful films. Derivative of Ingmar Bergman it may be, but a disaster it is not. The plot is simple - one day at breakfast in the Hamptons, WASPy lawyer Arthur (EG Marshall), coolly informs his elegant-but-domineering wife, Eve (Geraldine Page), that he wishes to separate. Eve - a controlling and perfectionistic decorator (hence the title) - promptly suffers an emotional decline which her children feel helpless to stop and which eventually leads her to suicide after her ex-husband remarries. This soap-opera material is lifted above the banal by three things - fantastic performances all around, a complex and demanding non-linear cinematic structure, and stunning photography and production design. INTERIORS is a perfect example of Allen's ongoing fascination with the psychological terrorism, physical restraint, and emotional coldness which he (rightly) sees as basic features of WASP society. Although portrayed in the story as the cause of everyone's problems, Eve is in fact the most sympathetic character. Only two of her three daughters - Renata (Diane Keaton) and Joey (Mary Beth Hurt) play a major role in the story, and both of these younger women are partially responsible for their mother's death due to their own problems - Renata is a frigid, neurotic woman whose success as a poet and author bring her no happiness, and who constantly competes with her sister for the attention of their father, while Joey is a highly-strung, perpetually unsatisfied individual who envies the talents of her sisters despite her own successful marriage. Neither one of them can stand their mother or each another, and Joey goes so far as to tear Eve to shreds psychologically in a devastating monologue at the climax which at last pushes Eve over the edge, causing her to walk into the open ocean just outside the family's Long Island residence. Joey frantically tries to save her mother, only to nearly drown herself. She is brought back to life by Arthur's new wife, Pearl (Maureen Stapleton), whose knowledge of CPR proves critical. Pearl is a slightly trashy yenta whose lack of intellectual refinement and sensuality charm Arthur (and the rest of the male characters!) but repulse the uptight daughters. Despite this, Pearl without hesitation saves the life of a girl who publicly insulted her at her own wedding just hours earlier! Photographed superbly by Gordon Willis, the drowning sequence is one of the most perfect in 1970's film-making. On the negative side, it has to be said that Allen's dialogue is often both pretentious and unintentionally funny - nobody actually talks like these people (the title of this review is one of the movie's funniest lines - watch for it), and their claim to the status of intellectuals is undercut by a lot of needlessly arch and senseless statements which reveal that Allen himself is far from the intellectual he is generally thought to be. Also, no one seems to have had a happy moment in their lives despite their money, talent and expensive real estate. Renata treats her husband like a fashion accessory, while Joey is an unrelenting nag and complainer (Why do you stay with me! I give you nothing but grief! she says to her grad-student husband - and she's right!). Nevertheless, the superb performances and fine photography give this film an emotional power - even a grandeur - which make it unique among Woody Allen works. You may not like this film, but you MUST SEE IT nevertheless, as few American films have ever even attempted to do what INTERIORS does. For his guts in making a movie which he knew would probably be rejected by the masses at the height of his own popularity, Allen deserves a great deal of credit. Within certain limitations, this reviewer regards INTERIORS as Allen's most personal masterpiece - it is an unforgettable and compulsively watchable film despite its flaws.

I was mesmerized from the beginning of the credits.Gregory the Movie Cat gave it big purrs and rubs.I'll go out on a limb and say Krull is the best pure fantasy film, ever. And that it achieves a singular kind of greatness in its unabashed and brilliant manipulation of deep psychological symbolism. It's like a romp through the collective unconscious. The only narrative films I can recall with similar resonance are Kubrick's 2001 and Jean Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast and Orpheus. (Dali's short films are in a somewhat different category.) Let's discuss these two claims individually. First of all, what do I mean by pure fantasy? Tolkien's ideas of willing suspension of disbelief and sub-creation--the creation of a fictional world with its own set of rules and consistent within that set of rules--are an essential part of pure fantasy, but are far broader. To my mind, one must add a few other criteria. First, it must not be an allegory. (James Cameron's forthcoming Avatar is an subjected peoples\/environmental allegory and thus would not qualify.) Second, its core must be a combination of several archetypes--notably the hero's quest, the comedy (disruption followed by restoration of order symbolized (generally) by a marriage, the magician, and (usually) the king. Its tone is characterized by distance from the world as we knowledge and a sense of wonder. Several of Shakespeare's plays (notably The Tempest) fall into this category.What would be exclude from this category? All of science fiction and horror, and most of what we call fantasy \/ adventure. The Lord of the Rings is borderline, and the 3 films are magnificent. However, like the books, the films are prolix, and would benefit from a good editor.Many of the bad fantasy films we see on Syfy, God bless it, fall into this category, But they lack psychological depth, and they lack the mysterious otherworldly quality of Krull.What, then, puts Krull into exalted company? First, the script. The script manipulates familiar elements into a combination that is unique. It rises to a poetic eloquence in some scenes, notably The Widow of the Web, which is one of the most astonishing things--outside of Cocteau--ever put into a fantasy film. And it fits into the complex psychological structure, of which more later.Then, the score. I can think of few other films in which the score so perfectly matches the images and the screenplay. Another commentator here has said that the score may be the best, ever--and it might be. It certain bears comparison with the best of Bernard Herrmann and the best of John Williams.Then, the look. Krull is a ravishingly beautiful film; the main exteriors in the Italian Dolomites create a familiar yet otherworldly atmosphere. The studio sequences do not fit terrible well, but they are right for what they want to do. The effects are fine--they support, not dominate, the first.The actors are fine. Some, like Liam Neeson, are well know actors in relatively small parts. Freddie Jones is a great character actor; Francesca Annis could not be better. Ken Marshall and Lysette Anthony make a splendid hero and heroine; in particular, Lysette Anthony is a refreshingly vital heroine who would never twist an ankle.What makes Krull a particularly exceptional film is its psychological structure. First off, we have a straightforward opposition of Good and Evil. We have the classic hero's journey, and the hero's magical companion. We have an integrated view of all four alchemical elements--Fire, Water, Air (the mountain peaks, the flying horses), and Water.We have two remarkable psychological and symbolic patterns. The first forms the spring of the plot--Man has Fire, Fire to Water, Water to Fire, Fire to Woman, Woman gives Fire to Man-a neat sequent of uniting man and female elements to one, with mutual consent--a mysterious ritual with clear psychological intent.The interruption, then completion, of this ritual, first separates Lyssa from Corwin then reunites them with the power to kill the Beast--evil and disorder.The second pattern is no less interesting--the failed joining of Ynyr and Lyssa (the Widow), which leads to unhappiness and the death of both, but produces the information that can unite Corwin and Lyssa--life, redemption, and happiness. There are other themes of separation and unification and other patterns as well. It's a literary analyst's delight.Finally, for all these reasons, I just love this film. It's a fantasy for adults and thinkers. It's beautiful and intellectually and emotionally satisfying. It's far better than, say, The Wizard of Oz.See it and enjoy.

The story isn't as strong as it's sequels,and sometimes felt like it was taking forever to get going. I was very absorbed with how it was starting,I loved how it was developing the relationship of Frodo and Bilbo Baggins,and how you could start to see a slight bit of tension due to the ring. But things just seemed to sour after all that,I lost interest in quite a bit of stuff. The set pieces are absolutely incredible,as are the special effects but it's often too dark for it's own good,the sequels had a good sense of humor about them,this one was mostly serious which hurt it in the long run.The performances helped make it bearable,along with a couple of outstanding action sequences that can literally take you're breath away,character development was quite decent as well. Moregoth vs Gandalf was quite a visual experience,it kept me on the edge of my seat,and did a good job of making an emotional impact. Fellowship is definitely well made,it's quite a sight to look at but as far as the fun factor is concerned there isn't a lot there,Ring fans will love it,but as far as regular audiences I'm not too sure.The Performances. Elijah Wood was pretty decent for the most part,while he looks much more comfortable and at home in the sequels,he manages to pull it off for the most part here. His chemistry with Sean Astin is absolutely excellent,you believe in there friendship,and the script manages to make you care about what happens to him. My only major gripe is I thought he overacted in the infamous demise of Gandalf GANDALLLLFFFFFFF!! I thought it was a bit over the top,but that's just me. Sean Astin is an actor who i'm not very fond of,but he's very likable here. Like Rudy he proved he can be a capable actor with the right material and his character has that right material. Ian McKellen is a revelation as Gandalf. He's completely intense,yet vulnerable with a great sense of humor,it's just a great performance for a memorable character. Viggo Mortensen is OK here. He's definitely not the actor who pulled of Oscar worthy performances like The Road or History of Violence but he's adequate. He has a certain charm that manages to overcome his somewhat wooden performance at times,his above average chemistry with the actors also helps. Orlando Bloom has one of the coolest characters without a doubt,for an elf he looks completely bad ass,with a lot of charisma..loved him!. Billy Boyd&Dominic Monaghan are the comic relief and it shows,they were bearable but just barley. Ian Holm is very credible as Bilbo putting on just the right amount of emotion and vulnerability. Christopher Lee Is simply chilling,often frightening his role is even more expanded in Two Towers. John Rhys-Davies got on my nerves one too many times with his sch tick,it seemed like he belonged in another film. Liv Tyler I didn't know what to make of,she's certainly great to look at but her performance seemed force and her chemistry with Viggo was mediocre. Hugo Weaving was alright he had a certain presence he brought along with him and did what he had to do well. Cate Blanchett didn't have a lot to do but did it well. Sean Bean was excellent as per usual. His character is completely unpredictable and had me on the edge of my seat whenever he was possessed by the ring.Bottom Line. Fellowship is a worthy film,but it's often too dark to be considered truly enjoyable. There were a lot of things I liked about it no doubt,but I most definitely prefer the two sequels there more action packed with better stories,and most importantly humorous.

A story that really sucked too.The story starts with chow walking to a night club. You know he needs to stretch out his double pistoled action arms for the beginning. I'm saying to myself Okay he messes up some people so we are gonna get action. Heres the bad part, THE OTHER CHARACTERS. Every other character that comes out seems like a reproduction of another character we've seen in similar action film. Another faulty problem is the action scenes are really dull and boring compared to the rapid style like violence we see in John Woo's other films. In this film, Chow kills like 5 or 8 men in his usual style like persona. Whats the problem? In The Killer (Which replacement killers is a knock off of.) He is mowing down 20 to 30 henchmen and they die ugly deaths. Replacement killers doesn't have that heart pumping stop til you drop action that made Hong Kong Cinema legendary and often imitated.Acting by chow isn't bad but he doesn't have a lot to go on. He really doesn't. At least Jackie chans US action vehicles have him as his usual self. in replacement killers he's just not dynamic or persuasive as a cold blooded killer. Mira sorvino is also misused, I like her acting but the writers should've looked over the script again to realize that her character seems more of a comical sidekick then a sexy love interest. The Asian gangsters are very wooden and very uninteresting. They don't know how to write them in. In John woo's films they are just regular people with different personalities and interest. In this film they are all stereotypically the same. Michael Rooker really sucked in this movie so I won't talk about him. Danny Trejo is in it but isn't used as he is in desperado playing the sophisticatedly cool and deadly Navas.Overall this movie is no John Woo film. I recommend Hard Boild The Killer A better tomorrow part 1 and 2, Bullet in the head and his American vehicles Face off and Broken Arrow.

In this film, Chow kills like 5 or 8 men in his usual style like persona. Whats the problem? In The Killer (Which replacement killers is a knock off of.) He is mowing down 20 to 30 henchmen and they die ugly deaths. Replacement killers doesn't have that heart pumping stop til you drop action that made Hong Kong Cinema legendary and often imitated.Acting by chow isn't bad but he doesn't have a lot to go on. He really doesn't. At least Jackie chans US action vehicles have him as his usual self. in replacement killers he's just not dynamic or persuasive as a cold blooded killer. Mira sorvino is also misused, I like her acting but the writers should've looked over the script again to realize that her character seems more of a comical sidekick then a sexy love interest. The Asian gangsters are very wooden and very uninteresting. They don't know how to write them in. In John woo's films they are just regular people with different personalities and interest. In this film they are all stereotypically the same. Michael Rooker really sucked in this movie so I won't talk about him. Danny Trejo is in it but isn't used as he is in desperado playing the sophisticatedly cool and deadly Navas.Overall this movie is no John Woo film. I recommend Hard Boild The Killer A better tomorrow part 1 and 2, Bullet in the head and his American vehicles Face off and Broken Arrow. I also recommend just sticking to Hong Kong films if you want action that is really gut gripping and has stunts that'll blow CGI out of the water. Sorry Antoine, just let Woo do all the action.

There are a couple of good little flashes one involving a bloody bath tub and another involving and nasty fire.

Having no knowledge in the making of fire, a small group of tribesmen are sent in a quest to find fire by retrieving it from nature or from other tribes they would meet. In their journey they encounter cannibal Neanderthals, Homo Sapiens, mammoths and saber tooth tigers, they travel into freezing and windy steppes, up mountains and through swamps, in a beautifully realistic Paleolithic Europe carved by the ice age, like no movie has yet managed to grasp so beautifully. To add to realism, there is no dialog in the movie. Actually, there is dialog, only it is in a primitive language (invented for the movie) which we do not understand, and there are no subtitles so its to the viewer to interpret what's going on (don't worry, its not hard).As a student in archeology specialized in prehistory and mainly in the Neanderthal cultures, I must say that this film corresponds quite well to what I imagine Europe was like 80,000 years ago. Only there are some mistakes or scientifically debatable aspects in this movie, but to its defense it was inspired by a book of the same name written in 1911, when our knowledge in prehistory was very weak.The English title is quite appropriate. It is indeed a quest, an epic journey in a mysterious and terrifying past where only man's wits and ability to control fire gave him the ability to survive against the cruel forces of nature. During the journey of the protagonists, there is a clever mix of horror, emotion and humor in their adventures. The photography is baffling, as well as the music and the general atmosphere.This movie is perfect and if I didn't give it a 10\/10 its because of the few scientific mistakes which, as an archaeologist, kind of make me cringe. Nonetheless I recommend this masterpiece to everyone.

A Fine popcorn movie like this only makes 14 Million,yet complete noisy garbage like Transformers 2 makes over 400 Million,clearly viewers now a days want quantity over quality, it's really sad that this film didn't get the attention it deserved. The special effects for that time are quite impressive,I was quite impressed with the alien effects.

I'm very picky on Sci-Fi it's just never been one of my favorite genres,but The Arrival is a thrilling piece of entertainment that's sadly neglected,hopefully this review will spread the word of how good this film is.The Performances. Charlie Sheen gives a dynamic performance for this type of film. combining the perfect balance of humor and seriousness,he's especially effective when he's all paranoid. Because he's Charlie Sheen he still manages to make us laugh. His chemistry with Teri Polo wasn't bad,they had there off moments, but mostly managed to make it work,and shocking enough he proved he can play an everyday action man,unlike Terminal Velocity where he felt out of place. Ron Silver is always a fine character actor and here is no different. He manages to be fitfully creepy while remaining unpredictable throughout. Teri Polo is OK as the love interest. While she Doesen't show off the charisma such as Meet The Parents, she's still quite adequate and did the job,even if she felt off at times. Lindsay Crouse has a very small part but managed to do a pretty decent job,her charisma with Charlie was spot on. Tony T. Johnson is a terrible kid actor,he's whiny while being annoying at the same time,I cannot state this enough if you're gonna act while being a kid show some talent!. Richard Schiff is the comic relief for the 1st part of the film,he managed to inject some laughs into the film.Bottom Line-The Arrival is a whole lot of fun it really is. Briskly paced with thrills galore,this is a Sci-Fi thriller you don't want to miss,it will keep you on the edge of you're seat i'm sure of it.

Lindsay Crouse has a very small part but managed to do a pretty decent job,her charisma with Charlie was spot on. Tony T.

It has a great sense of humor about it,I always thought Charlie Sheen was an underrated actor,his humor and charisma is what made this film work. It's unpredictability also helped, for once I had no clue on what the outcome of this film would be,the finale had me on the edge of my seat. It's kind of sad how the world is today. A Fine popcorn movie like this only makes 14 Million,yet complete noisy garbage like Transformers 2 makes over 400 Million,clearly viewers now a days want quantity over quality, it's really sad that this film didn't get the attention it deserved. The special effects for that time are quite impressive,I was quite impressed with the alien effects. I also thought the character development was above average for this kind of thing,example Ron Silver didn't have a huge amount of screen time,but the film did a great job of making his character quite unpredictable even though we know deep down there is something off about him. I'm very picky on Sci-Fi it's just never been one of my favorite genres,but The Arrival is a thrilling piece of entertainment that's sadly neglected,hopefully this review will spread the word of how good this film is.The Performances. Charlie Sheen gives a dynamic performance for this type of film. combining the perfect balance of humor and seriousness,he's especially effective when he's all paranoid. Because he's Charlie Sheen he still manages to make us laugh. His chemistry with Teri Polo wasn't bad,they had there off moments, but mostly managed to make it work,and shocking enough he proved he can play an everyday action man,unlike Terminal Velocity where he felt out of place. Ron Silver is always a fine character actor and here is no different. He manages to be fitfully creepy while remaining unpredictable throughout. Teri Polo is OK as the love interest.

You would think with the charming cast,Zorro would be an entertaining romp,but a lot of actors seemed to be slumming it on autopilot so to speak,especially Anthony Hopkins. Some of the sword fights were spectacular some of them were just plain dull,and that was one of this film's main problems it's inconsistency. It's lavish looking,it certainly had the right cast along with some decent humor,but too often I was in the middle of being entertained then slowly getting bored at what was going on,the inconsistent pacing ruined it. Stuart Gordon makes a great fiendish villain to be sure,and there are some great little comic bits|De La Vega telling Alejandro he has BO is one| but it missed out on so much potential. It's a little overlong at 136 minutes too,by the time the big showdown came at the finale it was too little too late for me,the choreography was well done and all, it was just dull. I will say this though,the film does make Zeta Jone's character likable in this film,unlike the 2nd where she becomes a snotty witch for a lot of the film. I'm not saying The Mask Of Zorro is a complete failure or anything,it had quite a few entertaining moments it's just much too inconsistent.The Performances. Antonio Banderas has to play the heart of the film in the 2nd half,he does OK but stumbles a lot,because his charm only gets him so far performance wise. His chemistry with Hopkins was very good as it was with Zeta-Jones,but he often came across as a buffoon more then a believable hero type,thankfully the sequel improved this problem. Anthony Hopkins is good,but you can clearly tell he's slumming it,this was a paycheck film for him and it showed,that's not to say though I didn't enjoy it cause I certainly did. He's so suave and charismatic you can't help but be glued to the screen whenever he shows up,for me he made the film and slumming it or not I'd like to be that good while slumming.

I was about 9 years old at the time, and quite frankly it blew my mind. The action scenes were just as intense to my young eyes as the laser battles of Star Wars, the giant red robot Maximilian scared the ever lovin' poop out of me because on a big screen he looked like he was about fifty feet tall, and the scene where he killed Anthony Perkins' character with his spinning blades haunted me for weeks. I came away from the movie totally enthralled and my brother and I pretended we were the brave crewmen of the USS Palomino, blasting away at sentry robots in our backyard, for months afterward.I've seen the film a few more times in the 30 years (Gawd, has it really been that long?) since that first viewing and it seems my opinion of it changes depending on how old I am at the time. When I last saw The Black Hole I was in my early 20s and was in the midst of my jaded, seen it all before phase, and at that time I thought the movie flat-out sucked. However, my opinion has changed again after watching it last night (as I close in on 40 years old). It's a fun ride, though it is a hell of a weird one as well. I kept thinking, What would ole Uncle Walt have thought of this one? There's no denying that on a technical level, The Black Hole was a triumph for Walt Disney Productions. It was the most expensive film they'd ever made at that time (and their first to be rated PG as well). The set designs of the ominous Cygnus space station and many of the special effects still hold up surprisingly well today. Where it doesn't hold up particularly well is in the storyline. Watching it now, it becomes readily apparent that Disney wasn't sure if they were making a straightforward, eye popping sci-fi action epic for kids (ala Star Wars) or a deep, dark, brooding drama for adults (ala 2001). So they tried to satisfy both camps, though not always successfully.I was never crazy about the scenery-chewing performance by Maximilian Schell as the insane Dr. Reinhardt; even as a kid, I thought he was overdoing it, and I still find him irritating. Yea, OK, we get it, he's crazy as a sh*thouse rat, but Schell's performance is way too over the top. The rest of the non-robotic cast are basically cardboard cut-outs (even the usually-dependable Robert Forster and Anthony Perkins), though when I was a kid, I related most to Joseph Bottoms' young hotheaded crewman, Mr. Pizer (this film's version of Han Solo) and he's still the most fun to watch. Of course, the crew's handy dandy, quotation spouting robot V.I.N.CENT provides the comic relief, but he also gets to kick some mechanical butt as well, as seen in his climactic battle with the evil Maximilian.30 years on, I'm still not sure I totally understand the ending of this movie, which comes as quite a shock after an hour or so of fairly standard sci-fi shoot'em up mayhem. Suddenly the viewer is dropped into a hellish, dialogue-free sequence of bizarre imagery (the crew of the Palomino screams helplessly as they plunge into the Black Hole, while Dr. Reinhardt fuses with his evil robot and lords over a fiery underworld of humanoids...or something like that). That ending was pretty heavy duty for a 9 year old and it still makes me scratch my head today. I guess The Black Hole didn't make enough money to merit a sequel, which is kind of a shame, because I have always wondered What the hell was that all about, and where would they have gone from here? Judging by the message board here on IMDb for this movie, The Black Hole is still puzzling viewers and causing discussions to this very day, which to me is the sign of a good film. Back in the late 70s\/early 80s, lots of sci-fi movies were released in the wake of Star Wars and most of them were (rightfully) forgotten.

I came away from the movie totally enthralled and my brother and I pretended we were the brave crewmen of the USS Palomino, blasting away at sentry robots in our backyard, for months afterward.I've seen the film a few more times in the 30 years (Gawd, has it really been that long?) since that first viewing and it seems my opinion of it changes depending on how old I am at the time. When I last saw The Black Hole I was in my early 20s and was in the midst of my jaded, seen it all before phase, and at that time I thought the movie flat-out sucked. However, my opinion has changed again after watching it last night (as I close in on 40 years old). It's a fun ride, though it is a hell of a weird one as well. I kept thinking, What would ole Uncle Walt have thought of this one? There's no denying that on a technical level, The Black Hole was a triumph for Walt Disney Productions. It was the most expensive film they'd ever made at that time (and their first to be rated PG as well). The set designs of the ominous Cygnus space station and many of the special effects still hold up surprisingly well today. Where it doesn't hold up particularly well is in the storyline. Watching it now, it becomes readily apparent that Disney wasn't sure if they were making a straightforward, eye popping sci-fi action epic for kids (ala Star Wars) or a deep, dark, brooding drama for adults (ala 2001). So they tried to satisfy both camps, though not always successfully.I was never crazy about the scenery-chewing performance by Maximilian Schell as the insane Dr. Reinhardt; even as a kid, I thought he was overdoing it, and I still find him irritating. Yea, OK, we get it, he's crazy as a sh*thouse rat, but Schell's performance is way too over the top. The rest of the non-robotic cast are basically cardboard cut-outs (even the usually-dependable Robert Forster and Anthony Perkins), though when I was a kid, I related most to Joseph Bottoms' young hotheaded crewman, Mr. Pizer (this film's version of Han Solo) and he's still the most fun to watch. Of course, the crew's handy dandy, quotation spouting robot V.I.N.CENT provides the comic relief, but he also gets to kick some mechanical butt as well, as seen in his climactic battle with the evil Maximilian.30 years on, I'm still not sure I totally understand the ending of this movie, which comes as quite a shock after an hour or so of fairly standard sci-fi shoot'em up mayhem. Suddenly the viewer is dropped into a hellish, dialogue-free sequence of bizarre imagery (the crew of the Palomino screams helplessly as they plunge into the Black Hole, while Dr. Reinhardt fuses with his evil robot and lords over a fiery underworld of humanoids...or something like that). That ending was pretty heavy duty for a 9 year old and it still makes me scratch my head today. I guess The Black Hole didn't make enough money to merit a sequel, which is kind of a shame, because I have always wondered What the hell was that all about, and where would they have gone from here? Judging by the message board here on IMDb for this movie, The Black Hole is still puzzling viewers and causing discussions to this very day, which to me is the sign of a good film. Back in the late 70s\/early 80s, lots of sci-fi movies were released in the wake of Star Wars and most of them were (rightfully) forgotten. The Black Hole hasn't been forgotten, and it is still worth a look all these years later. ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Family"}]
