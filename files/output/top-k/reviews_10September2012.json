Enter French auteur Jean-Pierre Jeunet, the man to helm the fourth Alien movie, Alien Resurrection. This fourth installment takes place 200 years after Alien 3. Scientists have gathered blood samples from Fury 116, Lt. Ellen Ripley's final resting place, and used them to create a super strong alien\/human hybrid clone of the Xenomorph slaying expert. These scientists pulled the Queen alien that was inside of Ripley out of her and used the Queen to start breeding the Xenomorphs. And, as one would expect, things quickly go wrong. It is, once again, up to Ripley to save a rag tag gang of space pirates from these horrific creatures running amok on a ship that is headed towards Earth at an alarming rate.Alien Resurrection is undoubtedly a Jeunet film, with its darkly comic atmosphere and animated and eccentric style. He adds all of his usual European flare to this exciting and explosive film. Alien Resurrection reverts back to James Cameron's way of doing things in this saga, making the film an action film rather than a suspense horror. Honestly, this is something I was happy about. It was neat to see the series switch back and forth between these two genres with Alien being a true sci-fi horror, Aliens being a strictly action packed film, and Alien 3 returning to the horror roots. Alien Resurrection is non stop action and with Jeunet's visual brilliance it is an absolute visual spectacle.Where Alien Resurrection fails, however, is in its script. Not so much because the script is bad, but writer Joss Whedon and director Jean-Pierre Jeunet had two different visions for the film. Whedon wrote a crazier and more tongue-in-cheek script, while Jeunet directed a more straight edge final product. This clashing is what makes this film falter the most. The style doesn't match the script, and when characters say or do things that seem a little silly in a more serious environment it feels awkward and cringe worthy at times.Also, Joss Whedon made a very bold move in what he did with the space pirates. He tried to create a group of characters who we could believe have worked together for a very long time and he tried to create an atmosphere around them that made them feel like a true space crew, not just actors thrown together to play certain archetypes. This is one of the most revolutionary things that the original Alien succeeded phenomenally at. No science fiction film has ever created this sort of atmosphere, and Alien Resurrection does't even come close. Whedon tried to pay a great homage to the first film in doing this, but really he just revealed to us the things that made the crew of Alien work by showing us what absolutely doesn't work.Visuall, Alien Resurrection is astounding and as pure entertainment it works pretty well. It's definitely fun and a great way to kill two hours. But with a script that is mismatched with the film's style and a story that is full of odd plot holes that continually take you out of the experience this film is kept from being much more than just a fun little action film. It has some great moments and if you've seen the other three films then definitely see this one, but don't expect the kind of quality you are used to with this franchise.

The name of the film comes from Danny's principal who asks him to write a paper on his brother Derek's lifestyle as a white supremacist. Derek is the gang leader of the supremacist group in his town and always seems proud to show off the swastika tattoo on his chest.I believe the theme of this film is how racism and white supremacy affect a society and how people can change their views by learning more about one another. For Derek, this change does not come easy, and as you find out at the end of the film, it does not come in time either.In the beginning of the film you see Derek killing several colored men who are breaking into his vehicle in the middle of the night. Derek is arrested and forced to serve time in prison. There he quickly finds others that believe and follow the white supremacy beliefs. He believes this group can help protect him from the black and Hispanic prisoners. He later finds out that this group is actually paying a colored group to keep them safe and he decides he does not want anything to do with them. The white group feels betrayed by him and becomes even more furious when he begins chatting with a colored man. This man is Lamont, who Derek works in the laundry room with at the prison. The white group ends up raping Derek the shower room. This is a real turning point for Derek as he is shamed by his own kind. He realizes the white supremacy beliefs are not the way he wants to continue to live his life.Derek ends up leaving jail as a new man, with new beliefs, but in the same world as he left it. He sees his brother, Danny, following in his footsteps and treating the colored folks in town the same way he used to. Derek is finally able to change his brother's views after he shares all he experienced in prison. Unfortunately, it is too late as Danny is shot at the end of the movie by a colored man in a restroom.One film American History X reminds me of is Once Upon a Time in America. This film is similar in the fact that a ganger is forced to return to an old life he had years ago and deal with the issues he left behind. This is similar to what Derek went through upon his release from jail.A couple of film techniques stood out to me while viewing this film. The first was black and white vs. color. The film was shot in color with the exception of many scenes which flashed back to different times in Derek's life. All of the bad memories were done in black and white, but the one happy scene at the end remained in color. This one flashback in color was of Derek and Danny running on the beach playing as young boys. The use of black and white in this film makes all the bad memories on Derek's life stand out.The other notable technique used in this film was the use of symbols. The large swastika tattooed on Derek's chest was a mark of white supremacy. This was shown in many scenes throughout the movie when he wanted to show the world his position on racism. At the end of the film, after he has changed his views, you see him touching and looking at it like he wants to get rid of it.I thought American History X was a great movie.

Suspiria, on the other hand is a movie so original and bizarre that it defies all anticipations, for better or for worse. You can tell right from the beginning that Dario Argento tried really hard to achieve something unique with the interesting setting of a prestigious ballet school in Germany as his foundation. Here we get to follow aspiring dancer Suzy Bannion who stumbles into a nightmarish panorama of frightening colors and strange phenomena when she comes to the conclusion that the female employees are in fact witches; evil sorcerers who create misfortune for nothing else than their sadistic needs. As far as the storyline goes, Suspiria fares rather well, relying on its originality rather than any kind of complexity. Witches are rare antagonists even in the horror genre, so any culprits other than unnaturally strong human beings, zombies and vampires provide a refreshing breeze that disobeys the norm. Characterization is another important criteria but I fear that the nature of the movie itself is far too bizarrely different for a proper assessment; in short, none of the characters are ever able to leave their one-dimensional realms even for the shortest of moments, but nor do they actually need to. Suzy, the protagonist herself, is incredibly hard to describe without using the word bland, but then again that was probably the only point of her character; a mundane girl with stereotypically female interests thrown into a bloodstained fairy tale of frightening proportions. Likewise, most of the other characters only embody one or arguably a few characteristics that don't really make for any deeper explorations.The writing suffers from slightly more troublesome problems; Dario originally intended the story to star young children of around 12. When the idea was rejected and the ages of the characters were raised, he didn't make any adjustments to the script. In other words, what we get are young adults who behave like they're still in their pre-teens. While we're on the subject I might also add that most of the dialog was not recorded whilst shooting with creates a certain delay that's highly noticeable and equally annoying; not to mention that it makes the already mediocre actors come off as severely worse.With all this said, are there any redeeming qualities to find in this movie? Sure there are. You can explain it in very accurate manners to almost anyone and they won't fall for it. Suspiria is incredibly hard to sell since it basically boils down into a visual and auditory experience where the primary importance lies in what you can see and the music you hear. As far as cinematography goes, an eerie atmosphere of strong colors and creepy shadows is achieved with limited effort but almost limitless effect. Enhanced by the insanely freaky and above all else bizarre soundtrack that emphasizes strange noises more than any melodies, the result is nightmarish. The viewer feels like he stumbled right into a fairy tale or dream-scape so mesmerizing and occasionally pretty that he finds it a lot easier to ignore logical inconsistencies (of which there are plenty) and scenes that suffer from poor execution.A lot has been said about this movie. It's been called a masterpiece, overrated trash and hauntingly creepy art. In the end, it requires you to forgive several flaws that are well worth forgiving with the insanely original and atmospheric viewing it provides. Whether or not you end up enjoying it might even be a question of minor irrelevance; it's going to be an interesting watch regardless of your personal opinion.

Here we get to follow aspiring dancer Suzy Bannion who stumbles into a nightmarish panorama of frightening colors and strange phenomena when she comes to the conclusion that the female employees are in fact witches; evil sorcerers who create misfortune for nothing else than their sadistic needs. As far as the storyline goes, Suspiria fares rather well, relying on its originality rather than any kind of complexity. Witches are rare antagonists even in the horror genre, so any culprits other than unnaturally strong human beings, zombies and vampires provide a refreshing breeze that disobeys the norm. Characterization is another important criteria but I fear that the nature of the movie itself is far too bizarrely different for a proper assessment; in short, none of the characters are ever able to leave their one-dimensional realms even for the shortest of moments, but nor do they actually need to. Suzy, the protagonist herself, is incredibly hard to describe without using the word bland, but then again that was probably the only point of her character; a mundane girl with stereotypically female interests thrown into a bloodstained fairy tale of frightening proportions. Likewise, most of the other characters only embody one or arguably a few characteristics that don't really make for any deeper explorations.The writing suffers from slightly more troublesome problems; Dario originally intended the story to star young children of around 12. When the idea was rejected and the ages of the characters were raised, he didn't make any adjustments to the script. In other words, what we get are young adults who behave like they're still in their pre-teens. While we're on the subject I might also add that most of the dialog was not recorded whilst shooting with creates a certain delay that's highly noticeable and equally annoying; not to mention that it makes the already mediocre actors come off as severely worse.With all this said, are there any redeeming qualities to find in this movie? Sure there are. You can explain it in very accurate manners to almost anyone and they won't fall for it. Suspiria is incredibly hard to sell since it basically boils down into a visual and auditory experience where the primary importance lies in what you can see and the music you hear. As far as cinematography goes, an eerie atmosphere of strong colors and creepy shadows is achieved with limited effort but almost limitless effect. Enhanced by the insanely freaky and above all else bizarre soundtrack that emphasizes strange noises more than any melodies, the result is nightmarish.

In the end, it requires you to forgive several flaws that are well worth forgiving with the insanely original and atmospheric viewing it provides.

When I say he's reaching for the sky, I'm basically saying that he wants every single scene to be some sort of major, emotional pay-off and it just doesn't work because it makes the material seem over-dramatic and fake. There really wasn't a single moment in this film where I had an emotional connection to because Spielberg wanted every single scene to be something epic. Usually these big moments happen at the end of the film or there might be two or three scattered throughout the running time. With this film trying to have one every minute, whenever something big does happen it's power is just drained from everything else that has been going on. I also think the film runs on way too long as there are so many sequences that could have been cut and they wouldn't have hurt the main story. What keeps the film moving are the terrific performances with Goldberg and Winfrey really standing out with their wonderful work.

A group of Americans (Jason Robards Jr , David Selby) led by Dirk Pitt (Richard Jordan , Steve McQueen was offered the lead role in the film ; however, he felt the script was flat and turned down the offer) are interested in raising the ill-fated Ocean liner Titanic. As the marine research foundation carries out the preparatives to pick up a precious radioactive metal whose only known world supply reportedly went down as contraband aboard the Titanic , as they have to raise and recover it . One of the team members finds out the Russians also have plans to raise the ship from its watery grave .This a spectacularly big-budgeted but slow-moving film that failed really at box office . The bulk of this tiring film surrounds schemes to locate and recover a valuable metal called Byzanium . The picture develops a thrilling suspense about a strange mineral along with an international intrigue blending the Titanic , Russians and submarines . Based on best-seller by Clive Cussler who appears as a reporter during a press conference ; however he hated this movie so much that he refused to allow the sale of any film rights for his other Dirk Pitt novels , he finally relented 20 years later, and agreed to sell the rights to 3 novels and the first to be filmed was Sahara, which Cussler also hated .

Henry Lee Lucas admitted to over 600 murders, whilst in fact, together with his comrade in mayhem Otis (Tom Towles) are probably culpable but for a fraction of those events. Inspired by the prefabricated musings of a trickster conspiring with police 'to clean up the books' John McNaughton supposedly presents us a portrait of a psychotic mind, but essentially remains underwhelmingly vacuous.The hyperbole of Lucas's life story is taken at face value giving a terrifying vision of a pair of two morally incapacitated individuals, albeit Henry himself finds a soft spot for Otis's cousin Becky (Tracy Arnold). The trio of off-beat uneducated drifters clinch viewer attention with idle chit-chat coupled with pending violence boiling just below the surface. Unlike Hannibal-like eroticism the serial killers are hollow, dead and pitiful, which allow for a certain level of affinity with the characters, though thankfully never creating a need for compassion. Suitably events are portrayed pretty matter of fact (thankfully) without the ulterior intellectually deviant underpinnings so predominant in serial killer movies - this murderer isn't a deranged genius, just a murderous lost soul.Low key direction with unassuming choreography keeps attention focused on Rooker and Towles, which make a oddly disturbing couple, believable, but at the same time unreal. Rooker especially has a tentative quality of lingering anger and dead eyes, which slowly rescinds during contact with the awkwardly naive Arnold. Gifted with the best lines Rooker excels at his portrayal painting an appalling picture of a psycho, albeit one that is doubly fictitious, hellbent on murder, but conscious enough to avoid having a modus operandi.McNaughton does also have some nice touches, which add undeniable dread, especially with the opening act, where murders are not shown, but heard menacingly dubbed over pictures of corpses. The strongest point of the movie (in true Funny Games style), when a tellingly graphic murder of a family is presented as a video tape being watched by the serial killers, drawing comparisons between them and viewing watching such gruesome pictures. Disturbing and drastic hard to recommend as anything other than exploitative horror, one so vividly criticised by Haneke in Funny Games. Roughly shot and essentially pointless and thoughtless, not even having the decency to entertain a story more based on fact and less on delusions. Maybe beforehand knowledge about the actual Henry Lee Lucs detracts away from viewing pleasure, as the true life story of his incarceration makes just a much more enticing talking point, than the on-screen imaginings presented by the director.

It's all a matter of perceptions and the subversive odyssey of Wyatt and Billy invites each of us to question our idea of freedom and morality. Easy Rider is the most defining movie of the New Hollywood generation because the very philosophy of this new counterculture was to unveil the innate good behind the seemingly bad young people with long hair, seeking an unreachable freedom through motorcycles or drugs, a hostile 'Peace and Love' counterculture with ugly and dirty people, all the more detestable because they were against the War. Easy Rider is the rallying cry of this misunderstood generation.The idea of losing a War is detestable for every American said General Patton, well these guys already conceive the war as a moral defeat and they were no less Americans. Wyatt rides a Stars-and-Stripes-motorcycle and a similar helmet and his nickname says it all 'Captain America'. And his buddy wears a bushman hat and Native-American style clothes, that's Dennis Hopper as Billy. Both are men who went looking for America. And couldn't find it anywhere, that's the core of Easy Rider the film is less an existentialist quest than a nihilistic escape, the freedom of Wyatt and Billy carries a big deal of tragedy. They're free because they know they can't fight the system without corrupting themselves so they just drive for their own ideals, earning them people's hostility. The film carries very strong 'Western' undertones, a rediscovery of America's territory, with new values, as if it was indirectly stating that the conquest of the West failed, that America didn't achieve much, didn't respect its territory, and maybe the outlaws are the real people, Wyatt and Billy are references to Earp and the Kid, and the wheel changing is brilliantly paralleled with a horseshoeing. Wyatt later confesses to the farmer that he admires his lifestyle, the way he achieved self-sufficiency with a big family my wife is catholic says the farmer with a smile. He just provided an interesting example of an alternate lifestyle that rejected the city without denying all the values like Family and hard work. Wyatt respects that.The following episode involves a hippie hitchhiker who leads them to a commune. The hippie counterculture, pacifist in nature, implied a huge come-back to the roots of Human nature, to a sort of hedonism that quickly revealed the limit of their lifestyle they escaped the city, but couldn't live without work and money, with just planting seeds on a desperately dry land and ask Divinity for rain, even Wyatt and Billy can't embrace this primitive philosophy, they maintain their cape to New Orleans. Life is made of many encounters and Easy Rider is full of them, but it's only when Jack Nicholson as the alcoholic ACLU lawyer George Hanson, makes his entrance that the film takes a spectacular takeoff and is elevated to its iconic status, because this time, we have the average man's perspective.Hanson is a pivotal character with his feet in the two worlds; he makes the most implacable diagnosis about the roots of America's ill being. Wyatt and Billy are pariah because they incarnate 'freedom' clothes, haircuts, smoking marijuana, drinking, it's a bunch of pleasures that are totally forbidden by 'American Way of Life', and what you're not strong enough to embrace; you'll be strong enough to fight. The rejection of all the traditional values reflects people's own frustrations, an anger they vented on the trio when they finally killed off Nicholson's character. Abrupt and anti-climactic, Hanson's death foreshadows the tragic path the film takes, these men have no chance to stand against society, but maybe the most exhilarating sensation of freedom is freedom to act even when the fight is lost. Easy Rider feels not just like a western, but like a modern revisionist western where at the end, it's the society that wins. Easy Rider is like the sad chronicle of an announced failure, foreshadowed by the enigmatic line delivered by Peter Fonda near the end We blew it &#x85; Billy. They couldn't find this America they searched for, maybe because this America doesn't exist. Even the possibility of this long trip was allowed by money, money earned from drug smuggling, sold to the establishment (incarnated by the Rolls-Royce) and hid in an American-flag gas tank, through a long-phallic tube. As Fonda said, they were literally screwing America's values, and indirectly compromising themselves like any other loser. Those who fought the system with sincerity like the hippies were meant to lose, those who rejected the city but not some values like the farmer, could live in peace and dignity, and the others were too compromised to succeed, the genius of Easy Rider is to be more than a milestone of a generational counterculture, it was also its own epitaph, when the prostitute's lovers realized they were, in their way, prostituting themselves.And maybe the film invites us to the same self-criticism as we should ask ourselves a few questions before judging it  Why many of those who cheered and applauded at the film's screening end up as bankers or conservative businessmen? Didn't they blow it too, surrendering to the system?Why the film rings a bell even if we didn't live that era, have things changed that much? And if we don't like the film, isn't it because it indirectly mirrors our own lack of freedom and maybe we unconsciously wish to be, even for once, an easy rider&#x85; ","genre":null},{"date":"10 September 2012","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper, Jack Nicholson in a free-wheeling cross-country journey&#x85; to us, average people who keep on complaining how life is not easy, they are the easy riders.'Easy Rider' is a slang term used in the South to describe a prostitute's lover, someone who doesn't care for commitment but maybe for the rest of us, an easy rider is a free-spirited man, one who's his own model.
