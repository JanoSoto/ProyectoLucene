From the great acting and dialogue, terrific rooftop visuals and the combination of beautiful, suspenseful music. I enjoyed the mesmeric views of San Francisco during the 1950s and the beautiful saloon cars with white wall tyres and blazing logos.The pace of the film unfolds quite cleverly. One minute the husband is asking the detective for help, neatly followed by a refusal, the next moment the detective is already working undercover, no need for acceptance speeches or excessive justifications. It's simply masterful scriptwriting flow.After 30 minutes running time I still had no real idea what the film was about, not that it made a jot of difference, followed by Hitchcock's knack of revealing practically everything all at once so that we don't get too bogged down. The scene being set once again for the next, even more mysterious part.The film does dip in pace a little during the mid section, but picks up again after a major incident, surprising us with surreal dreaming sequences, intertwining monochrome colours with bizarre and rather spooky effects.The film scores on so many levels that it left me be a little overwhelmed. It could be regarded as a story of longing or unrequited love, of madness and schizophrenic flashbacks, or a straightforward detective based mystery thriller, depending on how you look at it. The film is more thought provoking than any other Hitchcock film I've seen so far, I had to pause to consider the manner in which the plot had turned and why the situation had arrived at that particular point.It's a very intimate, almost creepy film in places about love, obsession, deceit and betrayal with pre-psychedelic overtones. I thought the switches between time and space were simply fantastical, with the twists and turns adding layer upon layer of intrigue, never getting old nor giving too much.After the underwhelming disappointment (for me) of James Stewart in 'Rear Window', this was a massive hit, putting Hitchcock firmly back on the historical 'best of' film map.

Intent on seeing the Cahulawassee River before it's turned into one huge lake, outdoor fanatic Lewis Medlock (Burt Reynolds) takes his friends (John Voight , Ned Beatty , Ronny Cox) on a river-rafting trip they'll never forget into the risked American back-country filled with rare and violent hillbillies .This interesting picture contains intrigue , action , violence , marvelous landscapes and a strong ecological denounce. This trilling film was based on an exciting novel by James Dickey . At the time this motion picture was rated ¨R¨ for its excessive violence , sex and profanity ; nowadays this dangerous standard is underrated . To minimize costs, the production wasn't insured - and the actors did their own stunts , for instance, Jon Voight actually climbed the cliff and to save costs and add to the realism, local residents were cast in the roles of the hill people. Very good cast as John Boorman discovered both Ronny Cox and Ned Beatty working in theater , neither had substantial film experience previously. The notorious rape scene was filmed in one take, largely at the insistence of Ned Beatty who didn't want to film the scene repeatedly . Billy Redden plays the role of The Banjo Boy , he was hand-picked from his local elementary school, largely due to his look , his large head, skinny body, odd-shaped eyes and moronic grin , he was discovered by director Tim Burton in 2003 working as a dishwasher . Top-notch acting from John Voight and Burt Reynolds . Author James Dickey gave Burt Reynolds a few days of bow and arrow lessons and by the end, Reynolds was quite accurate and proficient with the weapon . Both Charlton Heston and Henry Fonda turned down the role of Lewis before it was offered to Burt Reynolds, who took it ; also Donald Sutherland turned down a role in this film because he objected to the violence in the script , he later admitted to regretting that decision . This movie is considered to be the breakthrough film of Burt Reynolds , it marked his transition from acting and starring , this film reflects the start of the period of Reynolds enormous star power and box-office pulling power, his machismo persona being mixed with a critical recognized serious dramatic performance . Gorgeous cinematography by an excellent cameraman , as John Boorman wanted Vilmos Zsigmond as his director of photography as he had famously filmed the 1956 Soviet invasion of Hungary ; Boorman reckoned that anyone who had filmed under the threat of Russian tanks and guns would be ideally suited to such an intensive and grueling shoot as Deliverance promised to be. The motion picture was very good shot by John Boorman , though originally, Sam Peckinpah wanted to direct the movie ; when Boorman secured the rights, Peckinpah directed Straw Dogs instead . John is a real professional filmmaking from the 6os , though sparsely scattered and giving various classics . John started as an assistant direction and his friendship with Lee Marvin allowed him to work in Hollywood as ¨Point Blank¨ (1967) and ¨Hell in the Pacific¨ (1968) from where he returned to the UK and directed ¨Leo¨ (1970) , a rare Sci-Fi titled ¨Zardoz¨ (1974) or the ¨failure Exorcist II¨ (1977).

One of the earliest was Abel Ferrara's King of New York.The plot? Christopher Walken plays Frank White, a drug lord who's recently been released from jail. Walken navigates the film like Noferatu in Armani, his time in prison filling his skull with delusions of grandeur; he wants New York. Not all of it. Just some.White then sets about reorganising his gangsters. He arranges a series of meetings with rival Colombian gang lords and has his lieutenants, led by Jimmy Jump (Lawrence Fisburne), execute them all. As White reclaims lost turf, and expands into new territory, he filters more and more money into local projects (eg &#x96; a Harlem hospital). With these scenes Ferrara intends to overlap blood money and social benediction, but the theme is quickly dropped.Indeed, most of the films ideas are brought up and then quickly ignored. Frank repeatedly tells street thugs to meet him at an opulent hotel, but never does. He trades ominous barbs with local gangsters, but these feuds go nowhere. Much of the film instead watches as a trio of cops, played by Victor Argo, David Caruso and Wesley Snipes, attempt to take Frank down. Realizing that legal methods aren't sucessful enough, they thus resort to violent, extralegal measures. The film then traces two very broad movements, the cops becoming increasingly barbaric, whilst Frank, who exists in a kind of metropolitan purgatory, one foot in grimy dens, the other in luxurious hotels and up-market benefit gigs, attempts to go legitimate.Throughout the film, Ferrara approaches conventional scenes from odd angles. He stretches clichés to elaborate lengths and though his film possesses all the genre's typical plot beats, they're laid out in unconventional proportions, shootouts drawn to comically long lengths and moments of drama which would be fleshed out in another picture, treated wordlessly or quickly skirted over. This has the bizarre effect of making the film both interestingly idiosyncratic and totally uninteresting. What is Frank's goal? How did Frank become a drug lord? How does a white boy become leader of African American street gangs? Ferrara doesn't care. It's all about mood.Unfortunately this mood reeks of a very specific early 1990s aesthetic lots of abandoned warehouses, blue light, blue filters, plastic sunglasses, pounding hip-hop, shoulder pads, mullets, Vivaldi orchestrals, Schoolly D, MTV vogue, MC Hammer shenanigans, gold chains, early 90s gun-play, fade-tops, Joo Woo style outlandishness, over-ripe imagery, dual pistol wielding, bombastic car chases, full moons, coke snorting, Bling Bling etc etc. The whole thing looks like a Patrick Nagel painting. Bizarrely, Ferrara says James Cameron's The Terminator was King's chief influence and inspiration. He set out to recreate Cameron's neon and moonlit Los Angeles in downtown New York. Style was primary, plot secondary.But while the likes of Don Corleone and Henry Hill frolic in fine suits and stylish finery, Ferrara's hoodlums look like a joke. Such an aesthetic plagues all the early 90s gangster movies filmed in the year they're set. Unlike something like Scarface (1983), which knows its costumes and decor are totally ridiculous, these films tend to present themselves without irony, and without the mediation or distance of time. One can rationalise their ridiculousness away &#x96; the near past is a distant country, the distant past a familiar comfort etc etc &#x96; but the fact is, early 90s fashion was pure crap. Early 90s hip-hop or black fashion, was even worse; a kind of vulgar appropriation of everything from corporate sports brands to tribal wear. This cross cultural mishmash was a celebration of individual expression, but also a means by which those whom society deemed worthless conveyed, via materialism, a signal of worth. Hop-hop fashion then celebrated values of opulence and pea-cocking, until it began to recognise its own anxieties in the mid 1990s. Its statements of bravado then became increasingly toned down, its style went up-market and the poor were slowly priced out of ghetto fashion. Later, to be black and successful suddenly meant to dress like classy white guys. Of course Frank has no time for these expressions or anxieties. He's the only well dressed person in the film, moving like a suited Velociraptor as he coolly plots conquest.King ends with several protracted, bloody shootouts. Frank begins the film in the back of a stretched limo, but dies in the back of a taxi cab. I didn't want to make money that way, he says in his epitaph. And I never killed anybody who didn't deserve it. In the end, Frank White just wanted to be white. Legit. Establishment.Upon release, King was bashed for its sleaze and foul language. Ferrara would vocally defend the film, before all but disowning it years later for its irresponsibleness, before welcoming it back with mixed feelings. The film's noirish, nighttime aesthetic is stiff compared to Ferrara's later works (R'Xmas, Last Day on Earth, New Rose Hotel, Go Go Tales etc) and its law\/order, wealth\/slums juxtapositions are unsophisticated next to Ferrara's best pictures. Elsewhere King indulges in Ferrara's three loves sleaze, religion and silent cinema. He paints Frank White as a vampire risen from the dead tombs of incarceration (the rat sequence from Murnau's Nosferatu's is seen playing on a cinema screen), ready to spread his disease. But Frank also has a Jesus complex, hoping to deliver a great, apocalyptic purge; to clean up the city with his new religion.

He arranges a series of meetings with rival Colombian gang lords and has his lieutenants, led by Jimmy Jump (Lawrence Fisburne), execute them all. As White reclaims lost turf, and expands into new territory, he filters more and more money into local projects (eg &#x96; a Harlem hospital). With these scenes Ferrara intends to overlap blood money and social benediction, but the theme is quickly dropped.Indeed, most of the films ideas are brought up and then quickly ignored. Frank repeatedly tells street thugs to meet him at an opulent hotel, but never does. He trades ominous barbs with local gangsters, but these feuds go nowhere. Much of the film instead watches as a trio of cops, played by Victor Argo, David Caruso and Wesley Snipes, attempt to take Frank down. Realizing that legal methods aren't sucessful enough, they thus resort to violent, extralegal measures. The film then traces two very broad movements, the cops becoming increasingly barbaric, whilst Frank, who exists in a kind of metropolitan purgatory, one foot in grimy dens, the other in luxurious hotels and up-market benefit gigs, attempts to go legitimate.Throughout the film, Ferrara approaches conventional scenes from odd angles. He stretches clichés to elaborate lengths and though his film possesses all the genre's typical plot beats, they're laid out in unconventional proportions, shootouts drawn to comically long lengths and moments of drama which would be fleshed out in another picture, treated wordlessly or quickly skirted over. This has the bizarre effect of making the film both interestingly idiosyncratic and totally uninteresting. What is Frank's goal? How did Frank become a drug lord? How does a white boy become leader of African American street gangs? Ferrara doesn't care. It's all about mood.Unfortunately this mood reeks of a very specific early 1990s aesthetic lots of abandoned warehouses, blue light, blue filters, plastic sunglasses, pounding hip-hop, shoulder pads, mullets, Vivaldi orchestrals, Schoolly D, MTV vogue, MC Hammer shenanigans, gold chains, early 90s gun-play, fade-tops, Joo Woo style outlandishness, over-ripe imagery, dual pistol wielding, bombastic car chases, full moons, coke snorting, Bling Bling etc etc. The whole thing looks like a Patrick Nagel painting. Bizarrely, Ferrara says James Cameron's The Terminator was King's chief influence and inspiration. He set out to recreate Cameron's neon and moonlit Los Angeles in downtown New York. Style was primary, plot secondary.But while the likes of Don Corleone and Henry Hill frolic in fine suits and stylish finery, Ferrara's hoodlums look like a joke. Such an aesthetic plagues all the early 90s gangster movies filmed in the year they're set. Unlike something like Scarface (1983), which knows its costumes and decor are totally ridiculous, these films tend to present themselves without irony, and without the mediation or distance of time. One can rationalise their ridiculousness away &#x96; the near past is a distant country, the distant past a familiar comfort etc etc &#x96; but the fact is, early 90s fashion was pure crap. Early 90s hip-hop or black fashion, was even worse; a kind of vulgar appropriation of everything from corporate sports brands to tribal wear. This cross cultural mishmash was a celebration of individual expression, but also a means by which those whom society deemed worthless conveyed, via materialism, a signal of worth. Hop-hop fashion then celebrated values of opulence and pea-cocking, until it began to recognise its own anxieties in the mid 1990s. Its statements of bravado then became increasingly toned down, its style went up-market and the poor were slowly priced out of ghetto fashion. Later, to be black and successful suddenly meant to dress like classy white guys. Of course Frank has no time for these expressions or anxieties. He's the only well dressed person in the film, moving like a suited Velociraptor as he coolly plots conquest.King ends with several protracted, bloody shootouts. Frank begins the film in the back of a stretched limo, but dies in the back of a taxi cab. I didn't want to make money that way, he says in his epitaph. And I never killed anybody who didn't deserve it. In the end, Frank White just wanted to be white. Legit. Establishment.Upon release, King was bashed for its sleaze and foul language. Ferrara would vocally defend the film, before all but disowning it years later for its irresponsibleness, before welcoming it back with mixed feelings. The film's noirish, nighttime aesthetic is stiff compared to Ferrara's later works (R'Xmas, Last Day on Earth, New Rose Hotel, Go Go Tales etc) and its law\/order, wealth\/slums juxtapositions are unsophisticated next to Ferrara's best pictures. Elsewhere King indulges in Ferrara's three loves sleaze, religion and silent cinema. He paints Frank White as a vampire risen from the dead tombs of incarceration (the rat sequence from Murnau's Nosferatu's is seen playing on a cinema screen), ready to spread his disease. But Frank also has a Jesus complex, hoping to deliver a great, apocalyptic purge; to clean up the city with his new religion. Elsewhere the film oscillates between beautiful, spare, elegant imagery, totally cheesy moments, and crypto-Catholic imagery (blood sacrifices, bent Catholicism, rebirths, deaths etc) 6\/10 &#x96; Worth one viewing.

The idea of watching a 1998 Irish was not very attractive. After finished watching that movie I had a complete different idea. This movie has excellent role characters, such as Ian Bannen who plays as Jackie O'Shea, David Kelly as Michael O'Sullivan and Fionnula Flanagan who is Maggie O'Shea. I enjoyed a lot this movie because the way everything is planned by this Jackie and Michael. I believe this is an excellent taste of humor because in this movie this two characters are really old, in what movie we see that the protagonist who plan everything are really old? Another interesting thing about this movie is Michael because he is the one who has to pretend to be Ned all thru the film knowing that he is a terrible liar.The way the whole town was part of the plan made even more interesting to watch. The town had also very funny characters such as James Nesbitt who plays as Pig Finn. This character made the movie even funnier because he was always let down because no one could tolerate his smell since he worked with pigs. Who could forget the old grumpy lady who is trying to take advantage of the situation? This was a great film to watch because its an old classic movie but funny and has no violence. This film I recommend for all ages and a good film to watch as a family.
