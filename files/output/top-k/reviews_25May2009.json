Since then, the film has become a common cultural reference, and copied in the stylization and use of slow motion.It was only recently, on a boring Friday, alone in my room with my Xbox, that I finally decided to view The Matrix. I rented it off of Xbox Live, and immediately became sucked in by action sequences I recognized from more recent films, films which no doubt had used the Matrix as a large source of inspiration.The films main strength lies in it's visual appeal. consistently switching between the gritty harshness of the real, machine-ruled world, and the slick, sterilized feel inside the Matrix and other computer programs. The film implements visual styles never before seen in any film, and created a world, stretching the limits of the human imagination.The films second strength, is in it's mind-bending philosophies. What is the true state of existence? Is what you know reality, or simply a veil to a bigger picture. Questions such as these that go wild within the human mind but are never able to be truly communicated with others. The film draws heavily on Christian and Bhuddist philosophies and concepts.Very few times has such a mix of both action and philosophy been but together in film form. Thus creating such an automatic appeal to the viewers.But as with most films, The Matrix does come with its own flaws. As with many science fiction and action films. These biggest flaws lie in the ending. As with films such as Terminator 2 or Iron Man the film succumbs to typical Spiderman-ish corniness toward its ending, that does not seem fitting with the mature vision the rest of the film contained.Although sequels offer logical reasoning for the over-played sequences toward the end, it still feels as if to little explanation is left to be fully satisfying.One thing that has to be fully understood with the Matrix, is that it is almost completely dependant on its sequels to be complete. Not all is resolved in the end (in fact, not even the main conflict is resolved). It is truly a three-part saga, and is what it should really be viewed as.Science fiction lovers will (and have) found this film to put a fresh perspective on the genre and will love this movie for years to come. Non-geek people will probably enjoy most of it, particularly the concepts which are introduced in the movie.8\/10 stars ","genre":null},{"date":"25 May 2009","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" After the death of good science fiction movies (with a few exceptions) in 1994, the genre made a strong comeback with the release of the highly publicized The Matrix.

NO.The Terminator is without a doubt the defining Sci-Fi action film of all time. though future films of the same genre may have been better, this one stands alone as the founder of the marriage between Science-Fiction and Action films.The plot centers around the destruction of the world as we know it, due to computers becoming self-aware and destroying their makers Humans.

A computer-soldier called a Terminator is sent back in time by the machines, to kill the mother of John Connor, so he can never be born. The human resistance also sends one of their soldiers back in time, to protect the unborn child. Both soldiers are sent back to 1984, to battle over the fate of their future.Terminator is known as one of the most iconic story lines of all time, and rightfully so.

Why, what's the point?, what's the logic? what's the reason?, what's the meaning? Why? These are questions that should have been asked before Fox greenlighted Joss Whedon's piece of work, Alien Resurrection. This film is a failure on so many levels it's almost unbelievable.After the troubled production (and obnoxious, studio-meddling) of Alien 3, you would think that someone would just have enough brains to leave it be. Just let it end on a relatively good film (who's only flaw was the studio's editing after Fincher's walkout). But no, they just couldn't leave it alone, the resurrection of this franchise has absolutely no logic behind it. How could this film possibly succeed? Someone should have said.Let me begin my walkthrough of this horrible injustice. The beginning problem was Joss Whedon's script. Who on earth said Hey! let's have the buffy the vampire guy write our new Alien movie!, And then the next big question is Who agreed to it? The funny thing about it is that Joss has apparently escaped all retribution for this movie by stating that they filmed his perfectly good script wrong. But this argument doesn't hold up when you know the contents of the actual script, in fact, the resulting film did the original script justice (maybe even improvement).The film starts off with no setting, and no background. Where are we now? Why is this ship here? Who are these people? What is the universe's current condition? Are questions that are never fully or satisfactorily answered. In fact the film is so restricted by it's limited scope that it doesn't even seem to know the answers to these questions. It just makes a large amount of excuses to get both weapons and aliens into the picture, and let me tell you their excuses involve, cloning, evil governments and pirates or mercenaries or whatever they called them (they seemed like pirates to me). Where these people came from, and why are they pirates are questions that no attempt was ever made to answer.The biggest of the script's issues are the mind-numbingly wide plot holes that cause the entire film's premise to crumble. The excuses used to drag our battle-weary Ripley out from the grave is so clearly ridiculous they really can't fool even the most unscrutinizing audience.The foolishly ignorant use of science is used repeatedly throughout the film, most evident in the arrival of the Newborn (highly original name, ain't it). Apparently.(SPOILERS) Since a group of scientists removed an Alien queen out of a cloned Ripley (not like that even makes sense to begin with), the queen apparently takes on human traits, such as a human reproductive system, resulting in the birth of an alien-human hybrid. The hybrid kills the queen and then identifies with Ripley as her mother (which also, doesn't make any sense). The original Whedon-design of the newborn was so ridiculous that it had to be redesigned into a better (but still awful) combination which is somewhere between the hunchback of Notre-dame and Casper the friendly ghost. (NOTE All this info is thrown at you within a 4 to 5 minute period towards the end of the movie). (SPOILERS END) So at about this point I was asking, why? what kind of plot device is this. Randomly thrown in, it doesn't help or move the story along just simply makes it more inconceivable than it was to begin with.So aside from Whedon's completely non-plausible script, the entire air of the story itself was a major problem. It successfully rips all terror and dark intensity from itself, only to replace it with what can best be described as swashbuckling campiness. Scenes with humorous intent were thrown here and there with no particular meaning, although the ending result was not humorous at all. There is no substance, not even one original piece worth noting, the entire film reeks of the staleness of it's own concept.None of the acting was really worth mentioning, almost all of the performances felt weak and contrived, none of the characters had any depth or soul to them. Even Ripley has been leached of all her relatability, replaced with weird alien-hybrid version of herself that really leaves no character relatabilty in the film at all especially after a disturbing sex scene between her and an alien (oh yes, that was in there), they all just seem like disconnected people that we just don't know or care about.As I wrap up here, I will say this, if you are dying for some alien action, this will not satisfy you no matter HOW desperate you are. In fact you would be better off watching AVP, which, regardless of how weak a film it was, was WAY better than this crap.3\/10 stars ","genre":null},{"date":"25 May 2009","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Resurrection?

Well, they are all wrong. Going by the instinct that my opinion is better than everyone else's, For a Few Dollars More is Leone at his peak, and one of the better westerns of all-time. Unlike the two films first mentioned, this one doesn't overstay its welcome, doesn't drift off into unnecessary scenes, and ultimately presents Eastwood (and Lee Van Cleef) at his top form. For a Few Dollars More is spaghetti western at its absolute finest, and should be viewed at least once by any fans of the wild west.For a Few Dollars More (No longer under the rage of Kurosawa) is about two bounty hunters after a vicious criminal that recently escaped from prison with the help of his friends. While Man With No Name (Eastwood, of course) is in it for the money, Mortimer's reasons seem a bit more blurred. The film becomes a massive cats-and-mice game as both bounty hunters compete to catch and kill the criminal first.All the elements that made A Fistful of Dollars work were improved upon here the directing, cinematography, acting, pacing, and musical score. The close-ups, long shots, and quick edits are all Leone's signature, and yet again keep the movie moving and entertaining. The story is not only more original the second time around, but is deeper, and more engrossing.Geez Louise, can I discuss the music here? Morricone's music is truly epic and is twice as good as the first film in the trilogy, and arguably almost as good as his most popular score (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly). Whether it's the simple drumming during a stand-off, a bittersweet pocket watch song, or the fantastic theme in the beginning, Morricone's music should have earned him an Oscar that year (Does anybody even remember Doctor Zhivago's music?). Not only is it great music, but one of the best soundtracks of all-time.

Well, they are all wrong. Going by the instinct that my opinion is better than everyone else's, For a Few Dollars More is Leone at his peak, and one of the better westerns of all-time. Unlike the two films first mentioned, this one doesn't overstay its welcome, doesn't drift off into unnecessary scenes, and ultimately presents Eastwood (and Lee Van Cleef) at his top form. For a Few Dollars More is spaghetti western at its absolute finest, and should be viewed at least once by any fans of the wild west.For a Few Dollars More (No longer under the rage of Kurosawa) is about two bounty hunters after a vicious criminal that recently escaped from prison with the help of his friends. While Man With No Name (Eastwood, of course) is in it for the money, Mortimer's reasons seem a bit more blurred. The film becomes a massive cats-and-mice game as both bounty hunters compete to catch and kill the criminal first.All the elements that made A Fistful of Dollars work were improved upon here the directing, cinematography, acting, pacing, and musical score. The close-ups, long shots, and quick edits are all Leone's signature, and yet again keep the movie moving and entertaining. The story is not only more original the second time around, but is deeper, and more engrossing.Geez Louise, can I discuss the music here? Morricone's music is truly epic and is twice as good as the first film in the trilogy, and arguably almost as good as his most popular score (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly). Whether it's the simple drumming during a stand-off, a bittersweet pocket watch song, or the fantastic theme in the beginning, Morricone's music should have earned him an Oscar that year (Does anybody even remember Doctor Zhivago's music?).

The western genre is one full of beautiful scenery, exciting adventure, lovable characters, and a clear-cut view on who is good and who is bad. With stars like John Wayne at the helm, for decades we received plenty of tales of cowboys against Indians, sheriffs against bankrobbers, and Manifest Destiny versus Obstacles. But for every genre or trend, there's an anti-genre that comes around and breaks all the rules the original genre established. Clint Eastwood's infamously classic flick A Fistful of Dollars changes all the rules and begins a new trend of western cynical, hostile, tense, and full of surprises.The Italians had a totally different view about the American wild west. Sergio Leone's tale of double-double crossing is directly influenced by a Japanese samurai epic known as Yojimbo (Enough of an influence to actually cause a lawsuit). In this shoot-em-up western, The Man With No Name (Clint Eastwood) decides to profit off of both sides of a gang war in a violence-driven town by working for both sides. At first his earnings are huge as he tricks both sides but as time moves on, complications arise, suspicions are drawn, and trouble starts brewing.The Wild West of the mid-1800s was anything but clear. A lot of distortion between right and wrong and good and evil occurred, and this was one of the first westerns to reveal this. That's what drives A Fistful of Dollars; the questionable characters, questionable decisions, and sometimes downright cruel implications. Eastwood's character is the supposed hero, but he's no better than the men he is fighting. The story carries this film (technically written by Akira Kurosawa, har har har) to previously uncharted territory. Then the directing is what flings this western into new heights.Leone perfected the close-up shot. Whether it's to reveal emotion, to hide a surprise, or to raise tension, close-ups are scattered throughout the film, and almost always used effectively. The scenes move very slowly, almost to a halt. There can be elongated sequences of people staring at people. While it sounds pointless and boring, these scenes are done extensive amount of times to make the audience feel uneasy and unprepared for what's going to happen next. Most westerns past and present fail to deliver as much tension and suspense as Leone did, which is what separates his gritty westerns from the simple ones of McQueen, Wayne, and other American western stars. To put it simply, Sergio Leone is a major reason why this film entertains.Eastwood himself becomes an icon with his breakthrough role here. Delivering the role with earnest grittiness, few words, and sheer intimidation; he crafted the modern-day bad ass gunslinger. Sometimes to get someone's attention, its best to have your actions do all the talking, and Eastwood proves this. Then let's not forget Ennio Morricone's musical score. Easily one of the most underrated composers in the history of film-making, Morricone mixes simple melodies and songs with musical interludes that carry the viewer through certain scenes. His music will play in your head long after the film is over.Bottom Line While not the best western of them all, A Fistful of Dollars did indeed break all the rules towards how to make a gritty Western. Ever since there have been imitators (sometimes overdoing it; see The Wild Bunch) but none can ever match Leone's craft in directing and telling a story. The Leone\/Eastwood\/Morricone 1-2-3 punch is the deadliest in western film-making, and that's why after all these years, the Fistful of Dollars trilogy stands proud and remains just as popular.

","genre":"Action, Drama, Western"},{"date":"25 May 2009","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" In 1992, Tim Robbins played the lead role in a Robert Altman film called 'The Player', a film about an egotistical film producer in contemporary Hollywood; a man who was forced to face a reality check as a somewhat disgruntled situation closed in on him. With 1999's Cradle Will Rock, Robbins returns to the territory that sees people in the entertainment business struggling to lead the lives they would desperately like to. Only this time, he is directing a film about a group of people that do not so much need a reality check and to go through a blender of facing the repercussions one brings upon one's self, as much as he directs a bunch of characters trying to survive as the Great Depression consumes everything around it and desperation threatens creeps in.Like The Player, Cradle Will Rock opens up with a wonderful long take in a theatre, detailing the necessary surroundings; the sorts of people the film will be spending time with and gets across a general feel for the era in which it's set by having a news reel play in the background. It's a slow and deliberate opening, hovering and focusing on one individual as they lie there, back stage; capturing what will follow a hovering and a focusing on people within an industry the stereotypical image of which might be glitz, glamour and riches. These people are just trying to get by.Cradle Will Rock is set amongst those in the theatrical business in 1930s America, as opposed to the film industry in the 1990s. While systematically looking at art-forms and the want for some to censor art within this world, director Robbins paints a wonderful canvas of the class system within this time and how different struggles affect each and every one of the different layers of life. The film is often quite funny, even surrealistic in its gags, but it never trivialises the bigger picture of the situation and nor does it exploit those struggling for means of entertainment even though they are working within the boundaries of an entertainment medium.Amongst the all star cast is Marc Blitzstein (Azaria), a deep thinking and spiritual piano player desperately looking for inspiration and a tune to nail to his upcoming musical entitled Cradle Will Rock, the very piece everyone will come together and find solace with. We also get a steady turn from Bill Murray, as he plays Tommy Crickshaw, an ageing puppeteer who is tied to two young protégés. Then there is Angus Macfadyen's wonderfully eccentric portrayal of Orson Welles, as a young and energetic director so desperately trying to succeed in completing a play with his producer John Houseman (Elwes). On another equilibrium, John Cusak's Nelson Rockefeller gets into all sorts of bother with a Mexican artist that paints a wonderful mosaic on the wall of Rockefeller's theatre only to refuse removing Lenin's face he has included. Robbins effortlessly taps into the growing fears of Communism at the time but additionally finds time to present an argument on censorship without taking sides.Cradle Will Rock is essentially a feel-good piece. Its title suggests potential disaster, an ominous event about to occur, particularly if we think back to what follows 'cradle will rock' in the popular rhyme.

","genre":null},{"date":"25 May 2009","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" In 1992, Tim Robbins played the lead role in a Robert Altman film called 'The Player', a film about an egotistical film producer in contemporary Hollywood; a man who was forced to face a reality check as a somewhat disgruntled situation closed in on him. With 1999's Cradle Will Rock, Robbins returns to the territory that sees people in the entertainment business struggling to lead the lives they would desperately like to. Only this time, he is directing a film about a group of people that do not so much need a reality check and to go through a blender of facing the repercussions one brings upon one's self, as much as he directs a bunch of characters trying to survive as the Great Depression consumes everything around it and desperation threatens creeps in.Like The Player, Cradle Will Rock opens up with a wonderful long take in a theatre, detailing the necessary surroundings; the sorts of people the film will be spending time with and gets across a general feel for the era in which it's set by having a news reel play in the background. It's a slow and deliberate opening, hovering and focusing on one individual as they lie there, back stage; capturing what will follow a hovering and a focusing on people within an industry the stereotypical image of which might be glitz, glamour and riches. These people are just trying to get by.Cradle Will Rock is set amongst those in the theatrical business in 1930s America, as opposed to the film industry in the 1990s. While systematically looking at art-forms and the want for some to censor art within this world, director Robbins paints a wonderful canvas of the class system within this time and how different struggles affect each and every one of the different layers of life. The film is often quite funny, even surrealistic in its gags, but it never trivialises the bigger picture of the situation and nor does it exploit those struggling for means of entertainment even though they are working within the boundaries of an entertainment medium.Amongst the all star cast is Marc Blitzstein (Azaria), a deep thinking and spiritual piano player desperately looking for inspiration and a tune to nail to his upcoming musical entitled Cradle Will Rock, the very piece everyone will come together and find solace with. We also get a steady turn from Bill Murray, as he plays Tommy Crickshaw, an ageing puppeteer who is tied to two young protégés. Then there is Angus Macfadyen's wonderfully eccentric portrayal of Orson Welles, as a young and energetic director so desperately trying to succeed in completing a play with his producer John Houseman (Elwes). On another equilibrium, John Cusak's Nelson Rockefeller gets into all sorts of bother with a Mexican artist that paints a wonderful mosaic on the wall of Rockefeller's theatre only to refuse removing Lenin's face he has included. Robbins effortlessly taps into the growing fears of Communism at the time but additionally finds time to present an argument on censorship without taking sides.Cradle Will Rock is essentially a feel-good piece. Its title suggests potential disaster, an ominous event about to occur, particularly if we think back to what follows 'cradle will rock' in the popular rhyme.

He mastered the horror with The Shining, the sci-fi with 2001 and many others right up until this, where he aimed to tick the romance genre off his list. Sadly the American died shortly after presenting this to the distributer and so 10 years on, it is comforting to know he achieved something remarkable in the genre.Eyes Wide Shut is debated as one of Kubrick's worst pictures. From the upside down sequence in 2001 to the blood flowing elevator montage in The Shining, Kubrick was artistically driven, a perfectionist and this is, apparently, where he falls short in the 1999 release. There are no wondrous experimentations, minimal elaborate scene stealing montages or anything otherwise to suggest it is the same person who directed numerous Oscar nominated pictures. So this would presumably be the reason for the critical analysis, but the absence of the camera doesn't dissolve any promise or prospect from the film. Actually, the lack of sweeping scenes brings the film right down to earth.The story is after all a love story, a mature look upon a married couples lives with the use of drugs, sex and parenting to bring a strong level of realistic lifestyle to the picture. The scripting therefore requires little elaboration. There are many consistent montages with the couple, the close up of Kidman's confession is well executed by the director and one fine scene appears when Cruise enters the burlesque house. The sweeping smart approach to the masked personas is very well handled and the sharp music helps generate a feeling of chills and intensity.The whole sex concept is a highly interesting look upon human sexuality and desire, a depiction of lust, trust and intrigue. This is consistently debated throughout, and worth hanging on to right to the question raising climax.The music score is not on the level of say 2001 but it fits the mood of the script nicely. The strong piano strikes may infuriate edgy viewers but do settle the story into a state of intensity and drama.Cruise gives yet another strong performance as the likable Doctor but Kidman is so infuriatingly boring you may look away. The drug taking sequence is a brave attempt to spice her stereotype up, but is driven way out of proportion.Like all Kubrick pictures, there is a great mystery to solve come the end of the film, and just like Kubrick, he has rattled off another genre with a fine justification of romance.

But when a small boy is killed by the shark, they hire Quint, a professional hunter. Brody, Quint & Matt Hooper, a marine expert, set sail in a small fishing boat in order to catch the shark. But the shark proves to be a formidable adversary.Jaws is the first true blockbuster, one of the greatest money-makers in cinematic history, the definitive killer shark film. Its success at the box office surprised the whole world & spawned a whole host of killer animal films, from the excellent &#x96; the Australian killer wild boar flick RAZORBACK &#x96; to the downright cheesy &#x96; the Italian rip-off KILLER CROCODILE. Jaws made the name of then unknown director Steven Spielberg, who had previously made the brilliant DUEL.Jaws has gone down in history as one of the best horror films ever made (although there have been a few critics who are not impressed, perhaps having been poisoned by the vast army of rip-offs that have come out, including the sequels). Much of its success is due to Spielberg's uncanny knack of creating suspense & his mastery of red herring shocks. He makes the film go one way but then pulls back at the last minute with a red herring, at other times he distracts you before ramming the shocks home (the scene where Richard Dreyfuss investigates a sunken boat only to have a severed head pop out is a classic example of this).Once the main actors hit the sea in the small boat, the film turns into a sort of imitation of Moby Dick, with some embellishments thrown in by Spielberg. There's a wonderfully creepy scene where Robert Shaw, in one hell of a performance, tells of his experiences onboard the USS Indianapolis, of having survived the initial sinking only to face numerous sharks. It's a scene that really begins to make your skin crawl. The shark's first true appearance (up until that point, you have only seen the shark's fin or its POV), with the shark popping out of the water to scare the crap out of Roy Scheider, is one good shock jump. The film's pace starts to hit overtime when the shark effortlessly destroys the boat & goes after Scheider, who attempts to ward it off with a pistol & rifle, only to kill the shark by blowing it up.The film has some great acting, most notably from Scheider (who portrays a likable everyman-type hero) & Dreyfuss (as the marine expert). But Shaw steals the limelight from his companions, as the obsessed Quint, who tries to make up for his past wrongs by going after the shark with everything he's got, not caring if he dies in the attempt.

Those who don't get it probably only see a simple story about the life of one boring, ordinary man. It is sad that so many people miss, or are oblivious to, its deep beauty. This movie is the rarest of delights; it is visual literature, performed with heart and beauty rarely seen in our modern age.Joe is a long-suffering factory worker that leads a life of quiet despair. One day opportunity finds him, one so overwhelming it allows him to break out of this hateful life and live a new, amazing one, even if it is only to be short-lived. This opportunity comes to Joe in the form of a wealthy businessman, who wants to reward him handsomely for jumping into a volcano, in exchange for which the businessman will get land right in a primitive island for a rare material he needs for his superconductors. Joe then learns he has a fatal disease that will soon take his life; so in typical victim of life style, he simply goes along with the idea. Yet behind his decision we can see that Joe realises that this will be his last chance to break free from his sad life, and like the strange businessman said, go out in a blaze of glory. As Joe steps into his new life, he finds himself emboldened to chase after what he desires, true love, because he knows his time is short. But he is rejected by the object of his affection (the office worker Meg Ryan) and is rocked by the experience. Now, totally alone and with so little time to live, he faces a roller coaster ride of self discovery. The little steps in Joe's growth are wonderfully portrayed and occur with the support of some wonderful characters. Yet at each stage of his growth, Joe encounters fate in and around Meg Ryan characters &#x96; symbolising his lost desire, temptation and the elusive true love. The rebirth of Joe into his new life is probably the key theme of the story. In eventually getting to the volcano and facing his greatest fear, Joe gives up his life as he promised he would &#x96; proving the depths of his honourable character. But out of certain death Joe receives a miraculous reprieve - all at once Joe conquers all the events of his life that conspired to make him ordinary, and in giving himself up to this honourable death, he is rewarded with a miraculous survival and everything he could ever want for a truly happy life. He is reborn into a new man! The implication of the new life, though, is not that of a fairytale, but rather a gift of new knowledge and experience that is only achieved after his remarkable sacrifice. Joe is gifted with a mind-expanding awareness and experience of exhilaration. It all works as an effective allusion to the fundamental truth in life that every major achievement derives from sacrifice, and the reward is a new set of privileges and challenges. Wonderful.The fact that such deep truisms of life are so effectively intertwined with a simple story of an ordinary man is one I love a lot. I get totally absorbed into Joe - all externalities are almost non-existent in this movie - the movie is about a single reality, that of the life of Joe. This is a truly rare achievement, as most movies use actors as vehicles for external, rather than internal action. But this movie is all about the growth and change in Joe, one he does not even fully appreciate is happening. Hanks' genuine portrayal of innocent and kind spirit makes the experience desirable and the conclusion genuinely surprising and worthwhile. Meg Ryan and all supporting cast members are also brilliantly effective. This movie is a mountain brought to life from a molehill by the breath and breadth of acting talent, direction, editing and writing skill.To view this movie without perceiving its deeper meaning would be to ignore its true value and hence make it easy to dismiss. Yet the humble observer who can accept the influence of things greater than themselves will perceive the true nature of this remarkable movie, and as a result engage in a truly beautiful, emotional and thought provoking experience.

That brief description, although accurate, does nothing to convey the erotic timbre that suffuses the film. Indeed the opening scene says it all.Our hero is Caleb (Adrian Pasdar), pick-up driving cowboy who works with his veterinarian father. While out for some Saturday night fun, Caleb spies Mae (Jenny Wright), sauntering along (in luxuriant slow-motion) licking an ice cream cone and he is immediately smitten with her. After some good-natured flirting, Caleb drives Mae home just as the dawn begins to break. Stopping his truck along a dusty field, he tries to get a kiss from Mae, but instead of a soft kiss, she bites Caleb's neck actually drawing blood. After this, Mae hurries away and a puzzled Caleb is left to walk back home when his truck stalls.But something weird has happened to Caleb, the bite seems to have turned him. As Caleb stumbles home through a dry field, he begins to feel queasy; it almost seems like the morning sun is going to burn right through him. As a perplexed Caleb staggers across the road with smoke pouring off his body (a neat special effect), the Winnebago from hell roars into the scene and snatches Caleb off the road while his father and little sister watch this kidnapping helplessly.We now have our introduction to the vampire family and while they NEVER use the word vampire, it is clear that they must be something like that because sunlight is deadly to them and we soon learn they need a constant supply of fresh blood to survive. Normally, the family would just kill Caleb and drink his blood, but Mae has taken an interest in Caleb. She has bitten him on purpose in an attempt to turn him. Apparently she wants to have a mate and Caleb fits the bill. The other members of the family are not happy about this. They include Severen (Bill Paxton), Homer (Joshua Miller), Diamond Back (Jeanette Goldstein) and the leader Jesse (Lance Henriksen) who now has to decide whether to let Caleb run with them as a new member of the pack or just dispose of him at their earliest convenience. Reluctantly, he decides to keep Caleb with them, providing he proves that he has the capacity to kill.Now, vampire purists usually get up in arms about Near Dark because it doesn't observe the standard conventions of your average vampire movie. However, I see this as a good thing. Since when did becoming a vampire become as rigid as say joining the Priesthood? There really are no rules. Remember most of the behaviors and weaknesses associated with movie vampires are simply the creation of other screenwriters and have little basis in the original myths and folk tales.So Near Dark comes up with new rules for its characters to live by, OK, at least they're original. Late in the film when Jesse is shot point blank in the chest, he simply coughs up the bullet and hands it back to the shooter, who later notes rather obviously, That's not normal.Unlike other vampire films where the monster is often a tortured soul, in Near Dark, some of the vampires positively love it! For instance, Bill Paxton's Severen comes across as a good ol'boy who really has found himself since becoming a vampire. Unlike Caleb, Severen doesn't suffer any misgivings about having to kill people on a daily basis. His life of sleeping all day, prowling all night is one that he has adjusted to very well thank you. But there are moments of strange intimacy in the film as well. Consider the sequence where Caleb has to ingest blood from Mae to survive because he can't bring himself to kill another human being. Mae opens up a vein for him and as he kneels before her, he sucks the life giving blood from her arm with a ferocity that nearly drains her; until she is forced to kick him away. Caleb then lays back and looks up at Mae with a wicked smile indicating that he has gotten more than mere sustenance from this contact.If you have never heard of Near Dark, there are reasons for this. A little over a month before the October 1987 release of Near Dark, Warner Brothers released their more widely hyped vampire film The Lost Boys which swamped Near Dark at the box office. Add to that the fact that The De Laurentis Entertainment Group (D.E.G.), which was releasing Near Dark, was near bankruptcy in October of 1987. Because of this, Near Dark had its theatrical run cut short and it was quickly sold to HBO so DEG could recoup some money. Yes, Near Dark lost the box office battle, but ironically it won the classic film status war.Today no one watches The Lost Boys or even considers it a worthy film, but Near Dark continues to grow in popularity and gain new fans with each passing year and this happens in the best possible way, through word of mouth. With its compelling characters, exciting action sequences, moody nighttime cinematography and brilliant score by Tangerine Dream, Near Dark is the best cowboy\/vampire movie you'll ever see. Although that may be faint praise when you consider that the next best cowboy\/vampire film is the 1966 John Carradine classic Billy The Kid versus Dracula. ","genre":null},{"date":"25 May 2009","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Near Dark is a film that falls into the unenviable position of being too arty for the gore crowd and too gory for the art crowd.A short description can not do justice to the films complexities, but here goes; Near Dark is the story of a close knit family of vampires who travel around the Southwest in a Winnebago motor home looking for fresh victims and how their newest convert, because of his innate humanity, ends up destroying the group. That brief description, although accurate, does nothing to convey the erotic timbre that suffuses the film. Indeed the opening scene says it all.Our hero is Caleb (Adrian Pasdar), pick-up driving cowboy who works with his veterinarian father. While out for some Saturday night fun, Caleb spies Mae (Jenny Wright), sauntering along (in luxuriant slow-motion) licking an ice cream cone and he is immediately smitten with her. After some good-natured flirting, Caleb drives Mae home just as the dawn begins to break. Stopping his truck along a dusty field, he tries to get a kiss from Mae, but instead of a soft kiss, she bites Caleb's neck actually drawing blood. After this, Mae hurries away and a puzzled Caleb is left to walk back home when his truck stalls.But something weird has happened to Caleb, the bite seems to have turned him. As Caleb stumbles home through a dry field, he begins to feel queasy; it almost seems like the morning sun is going to burn right through him. As a perplexed Caleb staggers across the road with smoke pouring off his body (a neat special effect), the Winnebago from hell roars into the scene and snatches Caleb off the road while his father and little sister watch this kidnapping helplessly.We now have our introduction to the vampire family and while they NEVER use the word vampire, it is clear that they must be something like that because sunlight is deadly to them and we soon learn they need a constant supply of fresh blood to survive. Normally, the family would just kill Caleb and drink his blood, but Mae has taken an interest in Caleb. She has bitten him on purpose in an attempt to turn him. Apparently she wants to have a mate and Caleb fits the bill. The other members of the family are not happy about this. They include Severen (Bill Paxton), Homer (Joshua Miller), Diamond Back (Jeanette Goldstein) and the leader Jesse (Lance Henriksen) who now has to decide whether to let Caleb run with them as a new member of the pack or just dispose of him at their earliest convenience. Reluctantly, he decides to keep Caleb with them, providing he proves that he has the capacity to kill.Now, vampire purists usually get up in arms about Near Dark because it doesn't observe the standard conventions of your average vampire movie. However, I see this as a good thing. Since when did becoming a vampire become as rigid as say joining the Priesthood? There really are no rules. Remember most of the behaviors and weaknesses associated with movie vampires are simply the creation of other screenwriters and have little basis in the original myths and folk tales.So Near Dark comes up with new rules for its characters to live by, OK, at least they're original. Late in the film when Jesse is shot point blank in the chest, he simply coughs up the bullet and hands it back to the shooter, who later notes rather obviously, That's not normal.Unlike other vampire films where the monster is often a tortured soul, in Near Dark, some of the vampires positively love it! For instance, Bill Paxton's Severen comes across as a good ol'boy who really has found himself since becoming a vampire. Unlike Caleb, Severen doesn't suffer any misgivings about having to kill people on a daily basis. His life of sleeping all day, prowling all night is one that he has adjusted to very well thank you. But there are moments of strange intimacy in the film as well. Consider the sequence where Caleb has to ingest blood from Mae to survive because he can't bring himself to kill another human being. Mae opens up a vein for him and as he kneels before her, he sucks the life giving blood from her arm with a ferocity that nearly drains her; until she is forced to kick him away. Caleb then lays back and looks up at Mae with a wicked smile indicating that he has gotten more than mere sustenance from this contact.If you have never heard of Near Dark, there are reasons for this.
