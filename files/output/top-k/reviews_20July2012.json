[{"date":"20 July 2012","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Following the first attack on the World Trade Center and the attack in Oklahoma City, the threat of high profile terrorism on American soil was at one of its highest. With threats like these now entering the public eye, a film had to be made to demonstrate the possibility of a Terrorist cell working within one of America's most populated cities and the possible ways in which it could be managed. I feel this move depicts it well.Basically, the story begins in the Arabian Desert, where a high profile terrorist leader is captured by American forces and held in custody by Bruce Willis' character. We then cut to New York where an FBI agent played by Denzel Washington is on the trail of a terrorist organisation working in the Tristate area, starting with the faked bombing of a busy New York City bus. Working with Annette Bening, an agent who has infiltrated the Terrorist cell, he tries to uncover future plots being made in the city. However, the terrorists strike again, this time with another Bus Bombing, this time it's for real and several people are killed in the devastating attack. Soon afterwards, a theatre is bombed, and whilst away in Washington DC, a van bomb is driven into the lobby of the FBI headquarters in New York, killing several agents and close friends of Denzel Washington. Whilst in the Capital at a Joint Session of Congress, Bruce Willis discusses with the Cabinet the consequences of imposing Marshall Law on a US City, but following the truck bombing at the FBI headquarters, Marshall Law is imposed and Army troops are sent in to patrol the streets of Manhattan day and night. Meanwhile, thousands of young Muslim men are gathered into concentration camp style prisons so that any possible suspects are locked up. But things soon become unjust in the eyes of Denzel Washington as he watches Bruce Willis personally torture and execute a suspected Terrorist leader. Eventually the leader of the Terrorist Cell is found to be none other than Annette Bening's lover and someone they had apparently trusted as a source of information the whole time. During a final gun battle, both he and Bening are killed and therefore the Terrorist Cell is left leaderless. With no more need for Marshall Law, Bruce Willis is arrested on charges of torturing and executing suspects and taken before Congress.This film is perfect in almost every way, the acting reflects the characters they are trying to play, the story is really very gripping and it's all within the point of reason and logic, that theoretically a situation like this could have occurred in the 1990s. What's more chilling though is that the number 9\/11 rings through our minds whenever we think about this and especially when we see the frequently shown shots of the Twin Towers. The producers probably felt that showing the World Trade Center numerous times would make the audience reflect on the previous attacks that happened in New York and to show what landmarks are vulnerable in the city, and this leaves those who remember the dark events of September 11th thinking something ironic. It's a great film with a real grip on the situation and at least a grip on reality. I'd recommend it.
