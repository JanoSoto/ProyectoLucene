[{"date":"5 February 2014","score":"","review":" Rounders is not a bad movie, but does not stand out either. Rounders is about hold 'em poker, and Matt Damon trying to help a friend, Edward Norton who Matt owes. The Norton doesn't seem to learn his lesson and always relies on others' good nature to help him out of it. He uses his friends and does not seem to care. A couple of side stories where Matt ruins a love interest, and his university. The main story line of Rounders is about dealing with, reading, and playing poker with people. The directing, acting, and story is so so! I watched Rounders off a cable channel. Would I watch Rounders again? No! Just okay. Something to do on a cold February late night. Rounders is a six out of ten. Not a good hand which one would have to bluff their way through.
