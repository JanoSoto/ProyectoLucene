So I rented it, not only because I like the concept of the NOES movies, but also to see for myself what is this movie all about.And boy, was I disappointed...It has been many years since the movie was made, so I managed to be condescending even though I believe good movies survive time.This time, and for a change we have a multi-plot storyline, where we have three main characters able to throw the story ahead, but the really one that matters, because he is the one who really solves the movie throughout is the one that never seems to interest the viewers. I'm talking of Neil Gordon (Craig Wasson), the doctor who the mysterious Nun (Krueger's mother) talks to and finally destroys Freddy Krueger's body in the end. All the rest of the characters are used to distract the audience from this story. And that's sad, because the warrior background is good material. If it's Neil who finds out how to kill Freddy and if it's him who really does it at the end, what's the importance of the other characters if not only to feed up opportunities for gore moments? Even though it never really goes anywhere with it, Nightmare 3 has a good storyline, if we stick with the wrong idea that this is really about kids who face Freddy Krueger through their powers in dreams.But if we -again - are accurate onwards the story we understand that when the characters finally know their point in the story (to confront Freddy using their powers connected as a group, to survive) and they jump into the dream to do as they think it's best, they die. They only use their powers once and lose. The first time, the wizard kid uses his powers, he dies, the first time the drug addict girl uses hers, she dies too and the others never fully use theirs against Freddy. Only Patricia Arquette completely uses her kick-boxing features at Freddy only to fall to the ground easy and if it isn't for Neil Gordon's help, they would all die.What irritates me is not the fact that the characters fail miserably when put face to face with Freddy, but the fact that this is supposed - as the title indicates - to be a story about dream warriors, so at least they could give a bit of a fight and show at least once a cohesion as a group. It never happens. So, the best idea of the movie is wasted completely upon his failure to deliver what it promises.Another annoying thing is how shallow Nancy's character has become. She seems like a doll, acting almost without expression as if she was an angel. And in fact her role is not that important in the movie if we watch it as a whole. If there was no Nancy in there, the story would go exactly where it goes, only with the five special warrior kids. So why bring back such a rich character if not to make her unforgettable in her final goodbye to the saga? The only thing she's useful for is to stall Freddy Krueger while Dr. Neil Gordon destroys the skeleton.Oh, and more... What about the rules on Nightmare movies? If there's one thing that I think about movies is that if they create rules, they can't bend them willingly without explanation. Since the first movie, the basic rule is Freddy Krueger exists only in the dreams of people, nothing more and he only has powers within that world. So how the hell can he make his skeleton come back to life if that scene doesn't take place in the dream world? Where's the explanation for that? It's lame that they never give it. They could use the whole skeleton idea which is very good in fact, but at least they could explain how it is Freddy has powers over his real-life skeleton.OK, people can refute me, try to talk back and say that this was a b movie, so it's normal that there are flaws, but I cannot accept that as an excuse. As a spectator, I want to watch a movie regardless if they spent a zillions more or not on the script or effects. It has to be logical. Especially when all of the flaws that I pointed out are storyline mistakes, and a screenwriter takes the same money if he writes good or not.But this is movie with good moments too, so it's not all about negative things for me, it has great special effects and creepy atmosphere when we are in the dream sequences. Everything within the special effects in the movie is kind of mind-blowing and overall that's what stands off in the movie (the marionette sequence, the TV eating the star wannabe or the curious penis-like Freddy Krueger eating up Patricia Arquette).This movie could have been much better if it was told with fewer characters, and that is to me, what cripples this movie. There was no need for Dr. Neil's character, Nancy could fill up his role and be more active on the storyline with no harm done to the story. And I would like pretty much to see the whole group of dream warriors fighting together as a group, and not only the small showoff scene when they go and save the mute captive. But enough is enough, for this movie stands off as a sequel better than others did (Friday The 13th, Chucky, Scream) and managing not to be a terrible movie, this Nightmare sequel has style and creativity. And that has to mean something.

I don't immediately want to turn off any American patriots reading this review, so I want to make it clear that I'm not trying to be critical when I use the word myth. What I mean is that the American revolution did not begin as a group of U.S. patriots fighting against a tyrannical empire, but rather, as a group of citizens fighting for their rights within an empire. That it turned into a war, and that the war ultimately became a rebellion against an empire (the myth is not a lie, but it is an exaggeration), and that the war then gave birth to the U.S.A. is one of history's happiest series of errors and misfortunes (mostly by the British).The winners get to write the story of what happened, and in the case of the U.S., the story is written in terms of freedom. It's one of the most powerful, influential, and for the most part, beneficial stories that the world has ever known. The spread of democracy in the world, emancipation and enfranchisement of millions of people, the development of human rights, the growth of capitalism, with all of the benefits that it has brought (lower infant mortality, greater longevity, higher material standard of living) - all of these things have to greater or lesser extent (often greater) been driven by notions of freedom that trace back to the U.S.A.'s nation-building, and to its attempts to live up to the ideals that made the rebellion justifiable - to live up to the myth.U.S. citizens have lots of reasons to feel pride in their country. But criticising this film, and, for that matter, criticising America doesn't necessarily mean being unpatriotic, or mean that you hate America. The reason that patriotism stirs strong emotions is because where you come from is a big part of making you who you are, your opinions and values. Feeling proud of where you come from therefore makes you feel proud about yourself (by the same token, feeling shame about where you come from, or being told you should, tends to provoke a defensive reaction, as it's similar to being told you should feel shame about yourself. This is a lot of the reason why English people find this film so personally offensive). But if you're going to feel pride in your nation you should do it because there's something to be proud of, not just for the sake of feeling good about yourself.I think that's the main reaon why the historical misrepresentation of this film annoys people from other countries. As I say, Americans have lots of reasons to feel proud without having to make any more up. The U.S.A. is not a fledgling nation any more - it doesn't really need the myth. Its values have become global, and it doesn't need a story to justify them any more - they stand on their own. It certainly doesn't need to take the truth behind the myth and distort it yet further just to feel good. Feeling proud of yourself because of something that isn't true is self-deceit. Doing it when you're already king is hubris.I should also point out that pretty much every other country in the world has its own myths and self-deceptions, so this isn't an exclusive attack on America.

The spread of democracy in the world, emancipation and enfranchisement of millions of people, the development of human rights, the growth of capitalism, with all of the benefits that it has brought (lower infant mortality, greater longevity, higher material standard of living) - all of these things have to greater or lesser extent (often greater) been driven by notions of freedom that trace back to the U.S.A.'s nation-building, and to its attempts to live up to the ideals that made the rebellion justifiable - to live up to the myth.U.S. citizens have lots of reasons to feel pride in their country. But criticising this film, and, for that matter, criticising America doesn't necessarily mean being unpatriotic, or mean that you hate America. The reason that patriotism stirs strong emotions is because where you come from is a big part of making you who you are, your opinions and values. Feeling proud of where you come from therefore makes you feel proud about yourself (by the same token, feeling shame about where you come from, or being told you should, tends to provoke a defensive reaction, as it's similar to being told you should feel shame about yourself. This is a lot of the reason why English people find this film so personally offensive). But if you're going to feel pride in your nation you should do it because there's something to be proud of, not just for the sake of feeling good about yourself.I think that's the main reaon why the historical misrepresentation of this film annoys people from other countries. As I say, Americans have lots of reasons to feel proud without having to make any more up. The U.S.A. is not a fledgling nation any more - it doesn't really need the myth. Its values have become global, and it doesn't need a story to justify them any more - they stand on their own. It certainly doesn't need to take the truth behind the myth and distort it yet further just to feel good. Feeling proud of yourself because of something that isn't true is self-deceit. Doing it when you're already king is hubris.I should also point out that pretty much every other country in the world has its own myths and self-deceptions, so this isn't an exclusive attack on America. America just has the biggest film industry...

My vision is blurred, but there is nothing to see. The streets are virtually empty, and my friends and family are lifeless; sitting, standing or even walking, but with nothing to do or say, and nowhere to go. No questions are asked because there is nothing to learn, nothing is discussed because nothing is interesting. And it is this dismal reality I am faced with, only partially aware that there is anything better.The existence I dream of is somewhat reminiscent of the world of Henry Spencer, the main character in Eraserhead, who becomes father to a hideously deformed baby. That's what the film is about at face value, but the very style in which it is portrayed is the real beauty of it. The setting and scenery makes the film one of the most desperately depressing I have ever seen. And although Henry seems to be devoid of any spark of personality, we can't help but sympathise with him throughout the film.Similar to my dream, the only form of light is artificial, the streets are virtually empty, and the only person in the entire film who has any personality is the father-in-law, and the only thing he has to talk about is his poor health. He also seems to be the only one with any link to better times. (I've watched this city turn from pastures to the hell-hole it is now.) The city they live in is completely industrialized, and the only plant life seen is dead, and in a pile of soil on Henry's bedside table.Some have suggested it is based after a nuclear holocaust, but nothing is explained to any conclusion. One of the beauties of this film is that it practically begs the viewer to decide for themselves what any of it means, and there are many theories. I warn you not to read the message board of Eraserhead before you see the film, as it is so much more powerful and chilling to experience it first-hand.The first time I saw Eraserhead, I was completely confused. It is possible that David Lynch just put a load of random imagery together and called it a film. Maybe he wanted the viewers to put it all together and make their own sense of it (or not). On the other hand, there might actually be a set formula behind it and only the very open-minded and discerning audience can properly decipher it.One viewing of Eraserhead is enough to raise about a dozen questions, and to leave you gasping for answers. Two viewings are probably enough to give you theories about some of the cryptic depictions hauntingly portrayed. Three viewings might be enough to give you a completely different set of theories, battling persistently against your previous conceptions, but still leaving just a few details that don't quite seem to fit in. The truth is that there may be parts that don't make sense in one interpretation, but fit in perfectly to another. You could probably watch Eraserhead several times, and each time see a slightly different story. Or if you were to ask six different people exactly what Eraserhead is about, you would get six different answers, each equally correct in their own right, and each equally confused.That being said, this definitely isn't a film for everyone. This is the first Lynch film I have seen, and it certainly won't be the last. But there will no doubt be many who see this purely as a lot of clever mind tricks and special effects (for its time, anyway.) There will be those who don't like much to think about, and want it all explained bit by bit in perfect detail. Well, Eraserhead is an epitome of everything such moviegoers will hate. I will say this for certain If your favourite films are 'Love Actually' or 'Dude, Where's My Car?', you probably won't get much out of Eraserhead. But for those who like their concepts challenged once in a while, this film will probably be one to watch again and again until you understand. This is also not a film to be forgotten easily. Love it or hate it, Eraserhead will stay with you for a very long time.

The only good thing about that was the possibility for a spoof called I Forget What You Did Last Summer.

We literally have NO reason to care about ANY of them. Rose McGowan is nice to look at, but that's as far as it goes. But the worst is the actual killer himself. I know they were trying to break the invincible horror movie killer cliché intentionally, but they went WAY too far. This guy falls over at the drop of a hat!

We realize that Hortense's father is black...but is there another secret? After all, at the birthday party for Cynthia's other daughter Roxanne (Claire Rushbrook), Cynthia tells Roxanne that her father's name was Bingham - that he was an American medical student that she met on holiday while she was at Benidorm. So, she can tell people who Roxanne's true father was. But when Hortense asks if her father was a nice man, Cynthia can't say - or won't.The question to be asked here, which no one breaches, is Was Hortense the product of rape? Was the 15 year old Cynthia Purley raped by a black man in 1968 in London? And did she then keep the child, only to give it up for adoption? Why doesn't anyone ask this? Why does Cynthia let Roxanne know who her father is, but not Hortense? Now, was this done on purpose by the director and\/or the screenwriter? After all, it would be simple enough to see the name of the child, Elizabeth Rose Purley, on the birth certificate that Hortense gets a copy of.

From Brenda Blethyn to Marianne Jean-Baptiste (now on CSINew York without her British accent) to Timothy Spall, this film is filled with Oscar worthy performances. Why this was passed over for the (dull and boring) The English Patient is beyond me.I would recommend this film without doubt. It is one of the finest pieces of film-making and acting I have ever seen.

Most recommendable for viewing.A fantasy, a science-fiction, a movie filled with mixed spectrum of all the valuable human emotions and some of their most extremes, just like the life itself - the very theme it's actually trying to explore.*** About the movie itself There's something special about '80's, and the way technology and educated people looked and acted back then - this movie is the real way to see what I mean - you'll breath the air of the '80s, and it will smell so good. The movie explores human values, and tries to propose (and scientifically approve?!?) a philosophy of life as something that is beautiful and full of meaning. Personally I find it more than obvious that things are not like that in reality (if you value the truth above belief) - go figure (...); but, life is what we think of it, and the fantasy this movie gives to you is BEAUTIFUL. Also you can find some typically strange humor here and there (like the machines with an attitude for example), then - the Walken's joke to worry a bit his colleague etc... The movie recalls some good times. The concepts it brings out in a realm of inter-human relationships (I especially have two main characters in mind), and situations it depicts are truly wonderful. I love it.*** About my experience regarding this movie I was 1 year old when this movie was made, so I didn't have a chance to experience it the way it should be (instead - I've seen it just two years ago). Needless to say I had no idea about Natalie Woods... That was a shock. She is ONE OF THE most beautiful, and talented (I must add) actresses ever - by my opinion. If I didn't know better, I'd say that it is possible that I've physically seen this movie when I was still unaware of myself, and that it subconsciously affected the shaping of every single point of my own personality, all my likes and dislikes etc. This is the first movie here I'm commenting.*** Some very important points Idea about the technology to transfer experiences is magnificent (whole scenario is about that... what else to say). I like the angel choir in flashbacks, it really hits the spot. Majestic. Superb (this is why art exists, we've find it in our very 'souls', and we feel it). Cristopher Walken is without any doubt one of the best actors on the planet Earth - you just need to assign a correct story\/character (from the spectrum of his potentials) and you'll see (this movie does just that). Natalie Woods is presented in the most beautiful light in this motion picture - it made her stay alive for centuries to come (something regular people never achieve). Having in mind all of the circumstances around this movie, I still cannot imagine why those people tried to put it away!*** Conclusion You must be psychologically mature to feel this movie the right way. Technology there is truly in just to serve to a Human (nothing more (By-the-way that's all it should do isn't it...)). Great. But it seems that the peak of the movie is quite a bit higher at that flashback part between the two main characters... instead where it should be. Some more descriptive sights, situations and representations of concepts, (fascinating - in the spirit of the ones seen in the movie) here and there wouldn't be a bad thing.

I have a solid run of 240 straight, plus hundreds of others from other X-related series. Reading X-Men comics is pretty much the only thing from my old life that I still do. So, when the movie came out, I was ready to geek out as much as any Star Wars fan waiting in line for a prequel.I was also trepidatious that the movie would stomp all over that which I had loved for years, as Hollywood had done with every other comic book movie to have come out before X-Men. However, I was very hopeful that this one would be different. The reason? Bryan Singer.Bryan Singer, the director of The Usual Suspects, one of the coolest movies ever. If he couldn't make a good X-Men movie, then it couldn't be done. For years, there had been talk of an X-Men movie, and for years I didn't want it to happen. Then, they got Bryan Singer, and I was cool with it.When there was talk for years about an X-Men movie, there was always a consensus regarding one person that needed to be cast Patrick Stewart as Professor Charles Xavier. Because no bald cap would do, we needed a real live bald guy! I was surprised he took the role, since he already played one iconic fanboy character, I figured he'd be tired of going to conventions by now. But play Xavier he did, and he did so flawlessly. Singer filled the cast with another esteemed British actor Ian McKellen to play arch-foe Magneto, Oscar winner Anna Paquin as Rogue, big star (and eventual Oscar winner) Halle Berry as Storm, Famke Janssen as Jean Grey, James Marsden as Cyclops, supermodel Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as Mystique, a wrestler, and Darth Maul. A good blend of solid actors and cheap talent to fill out the cast. Better than Dolph Lundgren as The Punisher, I say.The only problem was casting the main character. They had someone cast, but he went and broke his hand right before shooting. So, they cast some guy no one's ever heard of, Hugh Jackman, to play the most important role in the movie. And he does so flawlessly. Jackman IS Wolverine, a performance so pitch-perfect that it just might be the best portrayal of a comic book character on film ever. Better than Christopher Reeve as Superman, better than Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man. The first time I saw him on screen, stopping a guy's punch, with the sound of clanging metal echoing through the theatre, I marked out like a guy in a storm trooper outfit seeing Yoda fight Count Dooku. Then, Jackman growls, and sneers, and SNIKTs. He had me at snikt. No, wait, he had me at bub. Or, at every time. Ahhhh... so good.Singer and co-writers Tom DeSanto and David Hayter do an excellent job in wrangling 40 years of mythology into a manageable 1.5 hour movie. He manages to show each of the 10 main mutants of the film showing off their powers in interesting ways (along with other background mutants like Iceman and Pyro), and hints at larger stories and origins surrounding them. He wisely plays down on some of the larger science-fiction elements of the series mythology, and focuses on the core myth surrounding the X-Men protecting humans who hate and fear them. It is the most resonate theme of the film and the mythos, and the one that best gives a film purpose.Sadly, the film is far from perfect. An hour and a half is not long enough to sufficiently develop the characters, leaving the film to operate at a break-neck pace to get its business out of the way. Even with the fast-pacing, it drags during the origin stories portion (or, at least it does for non-fans, it was just fine by me), while the audience awaits the next battle. And, in true comic book fashion, their is some really lame dialogue at times. Not Revenge of the Sith lame, but still pretty lame (Do you know what happens when a toad is struck by lightning? Ugh). Another problem is that favourite characters go underdeveloped or unfeatured (such as my favourite, Cyclops) while the movie focus on Wolverine, Xavier, Magneto, and Rogue. But, those are the choices that need to be made in a movie.Overall, I loved-loved-loved this movie when it came out. Loved the tension between Wolverine and Cyclops. Loved Rogue's longing for human touch. Loved Magneto's handling of the police. And now, watching it 5 years later, I still love it. Of course, I'm seeing it all through my X-Men coloured-glasses.

He already had tried to grab the lead of the saga in Nightmare 3, but was put aside for his ambition. But this time he knew he had to write material that would not only bring people back into the basic story, but also, create a new atmosphere that wouldn't break the notion that Freddy Krueger really died in The Final Nightmare.Therefore, he doesn't start where the previous sequel ended - has happened with the other installments. He transposes the barrier, to create a new environment, like only a storyteller could. This story begins in a supposed real life. Heather Langenkamp plays her own real life character, in a curious art-imitates-life new background.I don't want to reveal too much of the plot, but Both Heather Langenkamp, his husband and son are having recurring nightmares dealing with the making of the Nightmare movies. Though they don't really have Freddy Krueger in it, they surely bring up the idea that he is behind all of it. But being Freddy a character, why is Heather having nightmares? Who is in her dreams and why? The mystery doesn't bother Heather too much until her husband suffers a little accident...The previous sequels spent too much time with non-important character's deaths, but this one delivers depth to the characters so that you really fear for them when the tension comes to play. For instance, the original movie was about Nancy, the misunderstood teenager fighting alone for survival, but now, Heather Langenkamp is haunted by the legacy of her acting and has to fight alone not only for her life, but for the life of her son who is the chosen victim of the nightmare monster.There's only a flaw in the movie, and it is a pretty basic one and it has to do with logic *SPOILER HERE* If the ancient monster haunting Wes Craven's dreams wants to come to life why choose - as a doorway - an actress who only was in two movies? Yes, we all know Nancy was the first character to kill Freddy Krueger in a movie, but so what? Is she more important than Lisa Wilcox (Alice), who killed him twice in the saga, or Liza Zane (Maggie) who killed him definitely in the last one? I guess that the storyline would be better understood and more challenging if the story was about Robert Englund fighting for the life of his son and haunted by the ghost of his cinema character. Wouldn't it be more comprehensible if the ancient monster wanted to come to life through the person who gave him life for so many years? Well, I guess Wes Craven has a thing for damsels in distress, so he had to go for the female star even if she isn't that relevant on the franchise of Nightmare on Elm Street. As the movie goes forward and the monster starts growing with powers, Heather's life starts blending with the one of her character, Nancy, one of the things that puts us back in the dreamy world that was created for A Nightmare on Elm Street Though it's considered as a sequel, I can't see this movie as one, but as a reinvention of Freddy Krueger, who regains his scary side, erasing in a blink of an eye all the sequels that followed the 1984 debut.Watch out for great action sequences, like the highway crash and the final confrontation between Heather-turned-Nancy and her nemesis Freddy Krueger. Prepare yourself, the last 20 minutes are a roller-coaster.This is the ultimate Nightmare movie, a chance for people to get back to the original monster created in 1984 and that has been destroyed ever since and turned into a comic relief. And in fact, the concept of the movie was so interesting that Wes Craven tried to go there again in Scream 3, where the art-imitates-life idea comes again to life. But it certainly doesn't have the mind-blowing effect as this particular one did.

For instance, the original movie was about Nancy, the misunderstood teenager fighting alone for survival, but now, Heather Langenkamp is haunted by the legacy of her acting and has to fight alone not only for her life, but for the life of her son who is the chosen victim of the nightmare monster.There's only a flaw in the movie, and it is a pretty basic one and it has to do with logic *SPOILER HERE* If the ancient monster haunting Wes Craven's dreams wants to come to life why choose - as a doorway - an actress who only was in two movies? Yes, we all know Nancy was the first character to kill Freddy Krueger in a movie, but so what? Is she more important than Lisa Wilcox (Alice), who killed him twice in the saga, or Liza Zane (Maggie) who killed him definitely in the last one? I guess that the storyline would be better understood and more challenging if the story was about Robert Englund fighting for the life of his son and haunted by the ghost of his cinema character. Wouldn't it be more comprehensible if the ancient monster wanted to come to life through the person who gave him life for so many years? Well, I guess Wes Craven has a thing for damsels in distress, so he had to go for the female star even if she isn't that relevant on the franchise of Nightmare on Elm Street. As the movie goes forward and the monster starts growing with powers, Heather's life starts blending with the one of her character, Nancy, one of the things that puts us back in the dreamy world that was created for A Nightmare on Elm Street Though it's considered as a sequel, I can't see this movie as one, but as a reinvention of Freddy Krueger, who regains his scary side, erasing in a blink of an eye all the sequels that followed the 1984 debut.Watch out for great action sequences, like the highway crash and the final confrontation between Heather-turned-Nancy and her nemesis Freddy Krueger. Prepare yourself, the last 20 minutes are a roller-coaster.This is the ultimate Nightmare movie, a chance for people to get back to the original monster created in 1984 and that has been destroyed ever since and turned into a comic relief. And in fact, the concept of the movie was so interesting that Wes Craven tried to go there again in Scream 3, where the art-imitates-life idea comes again to life. But it certainly doesn't have the mind-blowing effect as this particular one did.

There's no time like the present. And Maximum Overdrive is rather a simple and amusing movie. Shot in the coastal town called Wilmington, North Carolina, this could be fun. Machines getting graphics, the ATM customer been called an (Bleep)hole. I would report this to customer service, however it would be safer buy person. Simply because everything electronic or battery-powered are taken life of their own! All because of a comet The Rhea-M! I liked this movie is because of one of my favorite hobbies Trucks! The trucks have caused more terror than anything else, the waitress just lost it after the electric knife attacked her, only to meet her end to a mad M-60 carrier. I would spend my time guessing the brand names of semis while everyone gets shook up by these renegade rigs. Rockets and machine guns were ready for these people, but the worst rig was the one with the ghastly goblin on the nose of the truck. That truck really ate the rocket! The funny part is when the coach of the baseball team got pelted by the soda can in the groin, but in reality it would be funny. But in the movie you can do whatever, laugh, gasp, or even scream. It's an enjoyable movie for all the horror fans. Rating 2 out of 5 stars.

I know now that I am vastly different than most of the people who saw this film and commented on it, because at no point during my viewing of this film was I all creeped out. The Exorcist was creepy. The Omen was creepy. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre genuinely disturbed me. This movie is not only boring, but TOTALLY predictable. The story is also quite pointless, leaving anyone with a brain to wonder why the ghost is doing what he is doing, and what the general point of the film was to begin with. As for the acting, I have no complaints. And if it wasn't for the decent acting, this movie would have sucked 10 times more than it already does. Maybe if I was like 8 years old, this movie would have been a little scarier, but at the ripe age of 29, and with hundreds of GOOD horror movies watched, I have to rate this film with a 4 out of 10.
