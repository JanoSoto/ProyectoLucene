This film is proof that good acting, and good photography simply cannot make up for a depressingly stupid premise.Joaquin Phoenix plays Clay Birdwell, a completely normal hick in a completely normal hick town. He and his best friend like to do all the normal things that hicks like to do. They get drunk and fish. They get drunk and drive around in pickup trucks. They get drunk and GO SHOOTING! So when Clay's best friend ends up dead, Clay ends up having to hide the body. This is pretty damn funny. Too bad it doesn't last.Clay is having an affair with his best friends wife. Who is probably the biggest bitch ever filmed. She ends up blackmailing Clay. Along comes Vince Vaughn or Lester Long. Your average everyday charming sociopathic serial killer. Who, as a favor to Clay, takes care of the wife problem.A great deal of the film attempts to flesh out the relationship between Clay and Long, unfortunately you almost immediately loose all interest because the way that Clay deals with Long is so obviously warped to meet the plot. All belivablity is sacrificed in order to let Long go on a killing spree. Which Clay makes pathetic and doomed attempts to stop. At one point Clay attempts to shoot Long with an UNLOADED REVOLVER! This is the same character that earlier in the film is shown shooting bottles swinging from ropes. Somebody who goes shooting for FUN. Yet does not notice that a REVOLVER is unloaded.Worse than that is the blatant imitation of other similar films. During scenes that take place in the police station a theme all too similar to Twin Peaks is used. At other times Silence of the Lambs is used and abused.Its so weak I nearly cried. Which is sad because Vaughn and Phoenix both give good performances. I guess neither of them were in any position to turn down work.

In fact I almost dosed off. If it had remained as such I would have happily sent it to the bottom end of my list with Bicentennial Man and Days Of Thunder. Luckily for it, me, and the group of friends that had dragged me along, it did actually pick up. While not actually doing anything new, Save The Last Dance comes across quite well. The characters are relatively believable, while the two leads suit each other. The dance scenes are well choreographed. OK, so it is a bit slushy throughout, but Save The Last Dance is the kind of film you'd get out if you wanted a nice, untaxing chick-flick.
