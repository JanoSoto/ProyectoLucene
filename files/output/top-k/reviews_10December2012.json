Klump rushes the experiment on himself after an embarrassing night out and becomes the skinny but annoying Buddy Love (Murphy). At first Buddy thinks this is what he wants but the side effects quickly follow. I don't care what anyone says but Eddie Murphy should have won the Oscar for this film and yes I've seen all the nominations from that year. It's rather amazing to see what Murphy was able to do here, playing at least seven characters and making of them one of the most memorable you're ever going to see. I don't care who you are but when you see Sherman Klump you can't help but fall in love with the character and the way Murphy plays him is just something amazing to watch. Even the Buddy Love character is quite memorable and this doesn't even cover the Klump family that Murphy perfectly handles. Rick Baker also deserves a lot of credit for the special effects and these here have to be considered some of the greatest of his career. The film really does walk the line between hilarious comedy and some rather sad and dramatic moments. There's no question that the film really packs a punch no matter what it's trying to do. The story itself certainly comes with a message that's not preachy and I think Murphy really delivers it in a touching way. The one flaw with the film is that it breaks out of a realistic nature at times and especially with way too many fart jokes.

This wasn't just a true story but it also had a strong racial background and how it was back then and the changing of views. Some people might have missed the subtlety that what coach Boone (Denzel) put the kids through summer camp was similar to a boot camp. He had to put them through hell to reduce everyone to the lowest denominator of misery so that you learn the only way to stop the pain is to work together as a single unit. This is what made him successful in integrating the players. This movie illustrates well how bad racism was and how it played out on and off the field. Although there were corny moments in the movie and the actors were clearly too old, they were minimal and didn't detract from the power the film. If you are looking at this movie as just another football movie or sports movie how much better can it be than ones in the past. You will be sadly mistaken and you will find this movie to take you by surprise. The film takes place in the early 70's in Alexandria Virginia with the T.C. Williams high school. Will Patton plays the current head coach that is going to be nominated to the high school hall of fame. Then bad luck strikes and a white store owner shoots a black man he thinks has stolen from him and he is wrong. The event causes big racial tension. To try to ease racial tension Yoast gets demoted to assistant coach for the new head coach Boone (Denzel). since a black man replaces a very popular white coach the residents become very angry and players are even willing to throw away their careers and quit the team. To make sure he has the best chance of winning and integrate the white and black players, he doesn't treat either better then the other. He ends up sitting the offense and defense all on different buses black and white. During camp he makes people run a mile for almost every mistake they make. Each and every player has to sleep and get to know their racial counterpart as their homework. They all start to create a special bond and start to act more humane and mature, lacking in the residents of the town. When the team starts to win all race issues are eliminated, and true team work on and off the field is born. With this being a true story and showing the triumph of the human spirit and the positives of change make this all the more enjoyable. The supporting cast do a great job and really make you care about all the characters and what happens to them. This movie shows that when working as a team anything is possible and makes you feel sad and the situation in the past even some now are silly when it comes to racism.

It's a peculiar hobby for a ship to have, I admit, but one that allowed this fairly fun story to unfold.George Kennedy, who always sticks in my mind primarily as a cop from the Naked Gun movies (even though I've seen him in many other movies), is at first a little hard to accept as the movie's Main Menace; I sort of half-expected to at any moment see Leslie Nielsen hanging around on deck as well, tripping over things. Kennedy plays a perpetually grumpy, misanthropic soon-to-be ex-Captain of a cruise-ship, so &#x96; naturally &#x96; the Nazi ship has an eye on him to become its new captain he might just be evil enough to steer it yet more large circles around the Atlantic.The movie wastes no time in getting down to business, unlike some horror films which take eons to get the plot rolling. In a matter of a few minutes we are given only the raw bones of who's who, without the unnecessary personal details that time is wasted on in slow-moving horror films that want you to get to know the characters. Why would we need to? They're monster\/zombie\/ghost-fodder anyway, most horror-flick characters. Only 10-15 minutes into the movie, and we already have the survivors aboard the Nazi ship, and that's when the fun starts. Nice and quick.Once on the ship, the perpetually morose Kennedy agrees to become its new Nazi lunatic, accepting his new position as the ship's Eternal Captain &#x96; or so he (and the viewers) mistakenly thought. Inexplicably, the ship &#x96; which had been aiding Kennedy in bumping off the shipwrecked survivors - eventually and very suddenly turns against him, thereby saving Crenna, his wife, their daughter, and their son (who seems to suffer from severe incontinence; his urination came quite close to becoming the running gag). It isn't clear why the ship did this. Until then, its sole purpose was to kill everyone aboard it (aside from Kennedy) i.e. all the un-haunted passengers, including the kids. Perhaps the Nazi ship finally realized that Crenna's children are blond and blue-eyed so it changed its mind about offing them? Who knows; I can't get inside the heads of most Hollywood writers, let alone inside the mind of a fictional Nazi ship.There is some other nonsense, though. This is a horror film, after all. 1) After the ship had sunk, Crenna and the other survivors drifted on a lifeboat for a while. It isn't quite clear how long they drifted, but the editing suggests that it must have been a few hours at least, a half-hour minimum. After this vague time-period, suddenly Kennedy appears from under the boat, gasping for air! OK, fine, the Nazi ship has magic powers and has kept him alive against all biological odds, in order to turn him to the Dark Nazi Side. But how come none of the passengers said hang on! How the hell did the Captain manage to hold his breath underwater for this long?! Where's he been all this time? Under the friggin' boat??? 2) Crenna, after having endured hours or maybe even days stuck on a life raft with presumably little or no water (on an open ocean) is finally offered some water by his wife a little after they board the Nazi ship. So what does he do? Does he perhaps drink it? No. He washes HIS BLOODY FACE with it. Damn, I'm surprised he didn't ask his wife for soap too. I refuse to wash my face and hands without soap, and when I'm done with that, and only THEN, will I drink it, but NOT before. Ever been VERY thirsty? Of course you have. Extreme thirst makes people lose all sense of dignity; yet Crenna seems to have both dignity and patience in superhuman amounts. 3) The kids are awful actors. Each one snickered in at least one scene, when they were supposed to be scared &#x96; or at least when they were supposed to be not snickering. I am amazed the director failed to notice this. Or perhaps he did &#x96; but only in the editing room months later when it was too late to re-shoot the scenes with the undisciplined little brats. Needless to say, I doubt these kids had much of an acting career after this film.A huge plus, and one that makes it easy to overlook some of the (minor) flaws, is the film's typical early 80s look which gives it a visual edge which it otherwise might not have had, had it been made later (especially in the visually awful mid and late 80s). The early 80s American films still had some of that wonderful 70s graininess. Very nice photography and an ideal, desolate setting for this kind of a horror flick. I wouldn't call this a hidden gem, but it's not too far from it, and definitely worthwhile for people who like early 80s horror\/fantasy films.

Kennedy plays a perpetually grumpy, misanthropic soon-to-be ex-Captain of a cruise-ship, so &#x96; naturally &#x96; the Nazi ship has an eye on him to become its new captain he might just be evil enough to steer it yet more large circles around the Atlantic.The movie wastes no time in getting down to business, unlike some horror films which take eons to get the plot rolling. In a matter of a few minutes we are given only the raw bones of who's who, without the unnecessary personal details that time is wasted on in slow-moving horror films that want you to get to know the characters. Why would we need to? They're monster\/zombie\/ghost-fodder anyway, most horror-flick characters. Only 10-15 minutes into the movie, and we already have the survivors aboard the Nazi ship, and that's when the fun starts. Nice and quick.Once on the ship, the perpetually morose Kennedy agrees to become its new Nazi lunatic, accepting his new position as the ship's Eternal Captain &#x96; or so he (and the viewers) mistakenly thought. Inexplicably, the ship &#x96; which had been aiding Kennedy in bumping off the shipwrecked survivors - eventually and very suddenly turns against him, thereby saving Crenna, his wife, their daughter, and their son (who seems to suffer from severe incontinence; his urination came quite close to becoming the running gag). It isn't clear why the ship did this. Until then, its sole purpose was to kill everyone aboard it (aside from Kennedy) i.e. all the un-haunted passengers, including the kids. Perhaps the Nazi ship finally realized that Crenna's children are blond and blue-eyed so it changed its mind about offing them? Who knows; I can't get inside the heads of most Hollywood writers, let alone inside the mind of a fictional Nazi ship.There is some other nonsense, though. This is a horror film, after all. 1) After the ship had sunk, Crenna and the other survivors drifted on a lifeboat for a while. It isn't quite clear how long they drifted, but the editing suggests that it must have been a few hours at least, a half-hour minimum. After this vague time-period, suddenly Kennedy appears from under the boat, gasping for air! OK, fine, the Nazi ship has magic powers and has kept him alive against all biological odds, in order to turn him to the Dark Nazi Side. But how come none of the passengers said hang on! How the hell did the Captain manage to hold his breath underwater for this long?! Where's he been all this time? Under the friggin' boat??? 2) Crenna, after having endured hours or maybe even days stuck on a life raft with presumably little or no water (on an open ocean) is finally offered some water by his wife a little after they board the Nazi ship. So what does he do? Does he perhaps drink it? No. He washes HIS BLOODY FACE with it. Damn, I'm surprised he didn't ask his wife for soap too. I refuse to wash my face and hands without soap, and when I'm done with that, and only THEN, will I drink it, but NOT before. Ever been VERY thirsty? Of course you have. Extreme thirst makes people lose all sense of dignity; yet Crenna seems to have both dignity and patience in superhuman amounts. 3) The kids are awful actors. Each one snickered in at least one scene, when they were supposed to be scared &#x96; or at least when they were supposed to be not snickering. I am amazed the director failed to notice this. Or perhaps he did &#x96; but only in the editing room months later when it was too late to re-shoot the scenes with the undisciplined little brats. Needless to say, I doubt these kids had much of an acting career after this film.A huge plus, and one that makes it easy to overlook some of the (minor) flaws, is the film's typical early 80s look which gives it a visual edge which it otherwise might not have had, had it been made later (especially in the visually awful mid and late 80s). The early 80s American films still had some of that wonderful 70s graininess. Very nice photography and an ideal, desolate setting for this kind of a horror flick. I wouldn't call this a hidden gem, but it's not too far from it, and definitely worthwhile for people who like early 80s horror\/fantasy films.

A number of others were left with little more than cameos, meaning we never got a chance to know them as characters so we remember them as Woody Harrelson, John Travolta, George Clooney, John Cusack etc. No genre of film relies on the audience seeing the cast as real people rather than actors more than a war film, given the intrinsic link between cinema and reality. This is what makes Malicks decision to cast so many well known faces all the more head scratching (although it is important to remember that many of the ones featured in the final cut and previous cuts were much less known then).Having said that, what is left is still a fine movie, beautifully shot (excepting for the occasional art for arts sake moment) with one of the finest scores I've heard in a long time.

He isn't what you'd normally call hot stuff. Richard Condon wrote a book about the mob, it was a comedy. Condon decided he would make his story into a film, so he approached Huston, despite Huston not having made a comedy in some time. Huston went through an impressive roll call of names for the various parts, but he made his mind up in the end with Jack Nicholson playing Brooklyn mobster Charley and Kathleen Turner playing the seductive Irene.Huston even cast his daughter Anjelica in the juicy part of Maerose. The film was not expected to perform well, but it became such a massive sleeper hit that when it came out on VHS, it was still in theatres. Critics loved it, and it nabbed Huston his last Oscar nomination for Best Director, at the young age of 78, a record that stands even today. So it would make sense for this film to be regarded as a classic these days, right?Wrong.THE PLOT Charley Partanna is born into the mafia, so when he becomes of age he becomes a contract killer for the Prizzi's, one of the most famous of the New York mafia families. At a family wedding, he notices the beautiful Irene Walker. He is immediately smitten, but he loses her and can't find her. Afterwards he gets a call from her, she's in California and she wants to meet him. The next day Charley flies out and they fall immediately in love, and so does she.He flies back home bursting with happiness, and he gets an assignment. Someone stole money from the Prizzi's casino in Vegas, and they aren't happy. It was a husband and wife job, apparently and they are in California, so Charley flies back out. There he shoots the husband, and then waits for the wife to come home. The wife is Irene, and she gives him the money, only there is half of it missing. In doubt over weather to kill or kiss her, Charley flies back to New York (again), and consults his former fiancée, after they have sex on the carpet.Charley decides to kiss her, and flies (seriously, they use the same airplane each time, it's really annoying) back to California and marries Irene. From there, the newlyweds go back to New York (guess the method of transportation) and begin to work on a new job. It turns out that Irene is a contract killer and she and Charley plan to kidnap a bank manager for ransom, only they are forced to shoot a cops wife, turns everyone against them, even each other.THE CRITICISMI really wanted to like this movie, but I think you can tell by my annoyance over the constant air travel (seriously, it's like an ad for United) that I didn't love this film. I didn't hate it though, because Nicholson is just so entertaining while trying to pull off a Brooklyn accent, though it almost works. It is a black comedy, but I did not laugh once or cringe. I sat there and saw the movie.Above, I wrote that this film has mostly been forgotten, and that is true. it was apparently a big hit in the 80s and I can see why. But it has been partially forgotten. Maybe because 1985 was such a weak year for film, this was regarded as good enough. Nicholson looks a little old, but he and Turner had sufficient box office appeal to pull it off. I had been told that this film was amazing and really bad. Personally I did not enjoy it, but it was entertaining enough.With the performances, Nicholson is so completely over the top that his Charley Partanna almost works, the accent is enough to make me smile, but unfortunately for a two hour long film, a smile is not enough. Kathleen Turner certainly has an abundance of sex appeal, but I found Irene to be incredibly similar to Turner's work in the outstanding Body Heat. She had me confused about whether she was a hero or villain, up until the last few minutes I did not know. Some would sat this helped the performance, but I personally just found it confusing.Anjelica Huston won an Oscar for her work as Maerose Prizzi, but like I said above, it must have been a weak year. Huston was good, but again I couldn't figure out weather she was good or evil. It just ended up confusing me. The rest of the cast does good work, but nothing jumps out. The cinematography can feel rather old school at some parts, but I guess that's just the way Huston interpreted the story. Alex North's score can feel clawing at some points, but the covers of popular Italian music can be entertaining.I felt as if the film was Huston taking a break. It certainly didn't feature any amazing shots or scenes, I cannot comprehend the film's multiple Oscar nominations, it seems to me like a really average film. That is not to say that it wasn't entertaining, Nicholson was enough to save the film from mediocrity. The end result is not the boring film it might have been without Nicholson's presence and Anjelica certainly injects life into her scenes, but in the end, despite the wicked satire of the plot the film never really goes anywhere you want it to and you are left feeling empty.But I guess that's better than nothing.Prizzi's Honor, 1985, Starring Jack Nicholson, Kathleen Turner and Anjelica Huston.

The next day Charley flies out and they fall immediately in love, and so does she.He flies back home bursting with happiness, and he gets an assignment. Someone stole money from the Prizzi's casino in Vegas, and they aren't happy. It was a husband and wife job, apparently and they are in California, so Charley flies back out. There he shoots the husband, and then waits for the wife to come home. The wife is Irene, and she gives him the money, only there is half of it missing. In doubt over weather to kill or kiss her, Charley flies back to New York (again), and consults his former fiancée, after they have sex on the carpet.Charley decides to kiss her, and flies (seriously, they use the same airplane each time, it's really annoying) back to California and marries Irene. From there, the newlyweds go back to New York (guess the method of transportation) and begin to work on a new job. It turns out that Irene is a contract killer and she and Charley plan to kidnap a bank manager for ransom, only they are forced to shoot a cops wife, turns everyone against them, even each other.THE CRITICISMI really wanted to like this movie, but I think you can tell by my annoyance over the constant air travel (seriously, it's like an ad for United) that I didn't love this film. I didn't hate it though, because Nicholson is just so entertaining while trying to pull off a Brooklyn accent, though it almost works. It is a black comedy, but I did not laugh once or cringe. I sat there and saw the movie.Above, I wrote that this film has mostly been forgotten, and that is true. it was apparently a big hit in the 80s and I can see why. But it has been partially forgotten. Maybe because 1985 was such a weak year for film, this was regarded as good enough. Nicholson looks a little old, but he and Turner had sufficient box office appeal to pull it off. I had been told that this film was amazing and really bad. Personally I did not enjoy it, but it was entertaining enough.With the performances, Nicholson is so completely over the top that his Charley Partanna almost works, the accent is enough to make me smile, but unfortunately for a two hour long film, a smile is not enough. Kathleen Turner certainly has an abundance of sex appeal, but I found Irene to be incredibly similar to Turner's work in the outstanding Body Heat. She had me confused about whether she was a hero or villain, up until the last few minutes I did not know. Some would sat this helped the performance, but I personally just found it confusing.Anjelica Huston won an Oscar for her work as Maerose Prizzi, but like I said above, it must have been a weak year. Huston was good, but again I couldn't figure out weather she was good or evil. It just ended up confusing me. The rest of the cast does good work, but nothing jumps out. The cinematography can feel rather old school at some parts, but I guess that's just the way Huston interpreted the story. Alex North's score can feel clawing at some points, but the covers of popular Italian music can be entertaining.I felt as if the film was Huston taking a break. It certainly didn't feature any amazing shots or scenes, I cannot comprehend the film's multiple Oscar nominations, it seems to me like a really average film. That is not to say that it wasn't entertaining, Nicholson was enough to save the film from mediocrity. The end result is not the boring film it might have been without Nicholson's presence and Anjelica certainly injects life into her scenes, but in the end, despite the wicked satire of the plot the film never really goes anywhere you want it to and you are left feeling empty.But I guess that's better than nothing.Prizzi's Honor, 1985, Starring Jack Nicholson, Kathleen Turner and Anjelica Huston.

Films like THE KINGDOM and TRAITOR (2008) will tell you just that. Although these films are inspired by actual events arising out of this war on terror, we need to go back a bit, precisely three years before September 11th 2001.Co-written, co-produced and directed by Edward Zwick, while adapting from Lawrence Wright's screenplay, The Siege was released late in autumn 1998, but holds a very prophetic and uncanny resemblance to real events that would occur just three years ahead. As expected, Zwick's corner stone here is Denzel Washington as FBI Special Agent Anthony Hubbard. Hubbard uncovers a plot where the Central Intelligence Agency has abducted a suspected Jihadist terrorist leader, resulting in a wave of retaliatory terror attacks in New York City. Just when Hubbard's task force zeros-in on a lead, he encounters mysterious CIA operative Elise Kraft (Annette Bening) who eventually starts a deadly game of catch and release, while recalling the fact that she trained militants to oppose Saddam Hussein. But before Hubbard can connect the dots, he must deal with an over-zealous Army General (Bruce Willis) hell bent on eradicating terror cells, even if that means disrupting the American way of life.In retrospect, this film appears to be a decent enough warning of things to come. And boy, did those things come! Not only did 9\/11 happen, it happened with striking similarities to that scripted for the film. If you study the film well enough, you will find that both the film and 9\/11 are similar, resulting in devastating attacks in New York. Perpetrated by jihadist terror cells, their main objective in the plot, mirrored in reality on 9\/11 2001, remains true to the fact that this type of attack has no motive, except a calm and calculated channel for causing maximum panic, devastation and disruption. Well embedded in the plot yet gazing straight at us is a question that boldly asks what the price of freedom is these days. However, what is seen as a thrilling piece of story-telling today was met with controversy during its theatrical release. Aside from questioning its political correctness, critics thrashed what was then considered racist when equating Arabs to merciless terrorists. But before the credits go up, Zwick's final message is that neither Arabs nor Muslims are terrorists. However, almost nine years later, Director Peter Berg seems to think otherwise in his gung-ho propaganda THE KINGDOM.Having worked with Zwick before, Washington delivers that tour-de-force performance we have since come to expect by default. In presenting some of the most cinematic and vocally intense scenes of the film, it's a wonder why he wasn't considered for any major award. The same goes for Annette Bening with a commendable performance in not just supporting Washington, but as a launch of things to come. Easily seen here during the prime of her acting career, Bening would be nominated for an Academy Award just a year later, along with a BAFTA Award for American BEAUTY. On the other hand, Bruce Willis's army general is as arrogant as he is conceited, and single-handedly portrays the trigger happy persona of the US war machine. Although Willis fits into this role with ease, there is a glimmer of sleepy-eyed enthusiasm that seems to lack proper characterization.Another mention also goes out to Tony Shalhoub, supporting Washington as his FBI partner of Lebanese origin. Best known for his role in TV's MONK, Shalhoub's character emerges during the second half and makes for a one-two punch before the end. There are various films out there trying to shed light on terror spawned by Jihadist extremists. While some have excelled, others have failed to keep up.

In the case of this movie, this film tries to show racism within a particular high school football team. Their attempt was promising but the movie's aim was not to show the racial harmony and problems but rather simply about football. This movie is based on a true story that talks about an African American football coach named Herman Boone (played by Denzel Washington) who is hired by a Virginia High School during 1971 to coach the Titans on his first year in T.C. Williams High School replacing Bill Yoast (played by Will Patton) whom is beloved by the school. Both men are not happy with the situation and circumstances they are put into. But they agree that for the sake of the team, they must cooperate and achieve their goal. A great example would be when Yoast tells Boone to treat his players like marines rather than high school students and does so. I thought that both Boone and Yoast were portrayed quite nicely, Boone does not show any sense of noble or arrogance and neither does Yoast show any signs of racism of being a racist for that matter. In fact, both characters show their ambition to win and how skilled they are at football. Another scene, which I personally enjoyed, was the ending where there was the closing touchdown, I felt that it resembled the end and victory over racism. The Film somewhat historically accurate but I felt that there was a lot of drama throughout the film. Of course, Hollywood loves to alter certain parts of the story to make it more interesting or compelling. It also seems that the film was exaggerated but overall, the film was quite accurate. But there are some raising questions during the film, such as we could only see that the Whites are afraid of losing their positions in the team thus not wanting to play with the blacks, but what about the blacks themselves? Didn't they transfer from an all black school? This film shows that the white people are very possessive and want to resent the blacks, and that the blacks themselves are feeling grateful and happy due to transferring to a better school. Another questioned raised is that what happened to the coach in the all blacks school? Why was Boone transferred to coach but not the coach from the all blacks school? This shows that the film has left out some possible information that might affect the movie dramatically. Remember the Titans is a predictable and heart warming film with strong emotional themes and powerful music but there are some areas where the film was lacking such as stated before, over-exaggeration of dramatization and the limited solution of racism depicted during the film.

If he ran away, he would be labeled a coward and be charged with a fine. If he went to war, he knew that he would never be the same again upon his return. And yet, even though these soldiers had little choice in the matter, they did not come home to a victory parade. Instead, they were viewed negatively as veterans. Add this anti-patriotic homecoming to their Post-traumatic stress, and the soldiers really couldn't win--just like Russian Roulette. I liked the director's use of this concept and found it to be a strong way to convey the problems that Vietnam soldiers faced.

There really was no need for a forth instalment. Sure this is probably hands down one of the most exciting series ever in cinematic history, but by the time it came to Lethal Weapon 4, it just fizzled into self-parody. Lethal Weapon 3 provided lots of exciting action, even some tender moments and the best teamwork Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) had ever accomplished in the series. Once the forth part of the series comes into fruition, we lose everything that Martin Riggs represented in the whole series. Even his Samson like mane is cropped off which made him look like a man who's aged quite rapidly and even his quick-wit and charm was absent there too.As for the principal antagonist I would like to say that I like the performance of Stuart Wilson as ex-cop Jack Travis. He's at an equal as the wild-eyed Riggs and he was more convincing than Jet Li's villain character in Lethal Weapon 4. Sure Li was a very fierce villain in #4, but still there was a lack of a compelling development like all the other bad guys from the other Lethal Weapons from the past. I thought that it was so sweet that that they added tough, but pretty internal affairs agent Lorna Cole (Rene Russo) into the cast and the relationship between her Riggs was so refreshing to the story. Sadly the chemistry was absent in Lethal Weapon 4. Besides in the forth instalment Russo was in very few scenes and was not deemed an important character in the story like she was in number three. And I thought it was cool that a female counterpart to Riggs is just as equally bonkers as him.Joe Pesci is back here as the lovable, but obnoxious Leo Getz, and though he provides a chunk of the laughs in this action comedy, he really starts to become annoying after awhile like flies in summertime. The real tender moment in the forth of the series was Leo's mourning of his dead frog But in Lethal Weapon 3 the sentimental scene is much more serious when Murtaugh inadvertently kills an adolescent who happens to be friends of his son (apologies to all frog lovers out there). When it comes to the funniest scenes, it was really hilarious when Riggs tries to befriend a cunning guard dog and acting like the dog.

Basically a small town has been devastated by a tragic event; a school bus driven by Dolores Driscoll (Gabrielle Rose) and loaded with most of the children of the town attending the local school was driving during the snowy winter morning, when it suddenly hit an icy patch, it skids off road down the hill until it reaches the lake an crashes through the ice and sinks, drowning most victims inside. Many of the isolated village community members are mourning the deaths of their children, including Billy (Bruce Greenwood), the Walkers who lost their mentally developed and challenged son Sean (Devon Finn), and the Ottos who lost their aboriginal son Bear (Simon Baker) who was adopted. Some did survive the accident, including now wheelchair bound aspiring songstress Nicole Burnell (Sarah Polley), and Dolores, we see the accident in flashbacks while lawyer Mitchell Stevens (Sir Ian Holm) has arrived in the Canadian town wanting to take some slight advantage of the situation and get the parents of the twenty dead children to sue whatever party may be guilty for causing the incident, he will obviously represent those who agree to it. He plans to target the big companies and organisations with big amounts of money and who have some involvement with the school, most of the parents he see accept his proposal and see it as some way to get over the grieving, others are simply interested in the potential for the money, and some like Billy want nothing to do with a lawsuit. Stevens himself has demons as he suffered the death of his son and still feels grief, so he knows how the victims feel, but his son's death has also resulted in his daughter Zoe (Caerthan Banks) turning to drugs, losing respect for her father and any real relationship with him, and he knows life in the town has never been the same since this terrible event. Also starring Tom McCamus as Sam Burnell, Arsinée Khanjian as Wanda Otto, Alberta Watson as Risa Walker, Mousehunt's Maury Chaykin as Wendell Walker, Brooke Johnson as Mary Burnell, David Hemblen as Abbott Driscoll and Peter Donaldson as Schwartz. Holm gives a pretty good glum performance as the ambulance-chasing who is trying to earn but also help those in the same grief-stricken situation he is in, Greenwood gets a reasonably good amount of time on screen, and I agree that from what I remember Polley is exceptional as the survivor paralysed by the accident. I will confess that I drifted in some of the story, particularly the parts involving a lawsuit and what have you, but it was certainly interesting to see a story about how one truly tragic incident can change the dynamics and personalities of a whole town community, it has got the right amount of intensity and atmosphere to keep you watching, a worthwhile psychological drama.

However, Andy is disappointed because he did not get the gift he wanted; a Good Guy doll which is the new craze for Andy. Karen feels bad that she could not get the doll because it costs a whopping $100(which is the most expensive doll I have ever seen) and, during work, buys one off a bum in an alley for $35. Later that Night Andy is being babysat by his Aunt Maggie played by Dinah Mannoff who starts hearing strange noises after Andy goes to bed and soon enough Aunt Maggie is killed by falling out of a window. The police possibly target Andy but claims it his Chucky Doll. They think it mighty have something to do with serial killer Charles Lee Ray played by Brad Dourif who was killed by Detective Mike Norris played by Chris Sarandon. The mother realizes that the doll is alive and contains soul of Charles Lee Ray. Chucky voiced by Brad Dourif has to transfer his soul into the first person he revealed his secret to, or else he will be stuck in the doll body forever. The first person he revealed his secret to was Andy.The first thing that I want to praise the story which is original and is very reminiscent of The Talking Tina episode of The Twilight Zone. Also the film wants to make you think Is this all real or just inside little Andys head? Although sequels came along and demolished this thought. Introducing black magic in a horror film was something not done in horror films back then and not very much today so it is interesting to see it here.The next thing are the special effects which are some of the best, if not the best I have ever seen. The doll effects are creepy and when Charles Lee Ray gets transferred into the doll, as the film progresses the doll goes form a squeaky clean look to a dirty, gritty look and I thought that that was very clever. Also (Spoiler) but the effects at the end where Chucky Gets burned alive are great.The next are the performances which are fantastic. Alex Vincent is convincing as the plucky yet frightened Andy, Catherine Hicks is great as the disbelieving mom and of course Chucky would not be what he is today without the terrific voice work of Brad Dourif who takes the little boy cute and safe voice of the good guy doll and turns it into a menacing and dark beast.The final topic is the music and suspense factor. The theme that they use at the end of the film is a bunch of bells and angellic tones. This makes the music very spooky, but what is even creepier is the angellic choir. This makes it haunting and gives me chills every time I listen to it. They were going to use a Chucky theme song but cut it out due to it not being scary enough, and after listening to it I can see why. Thats like putting Eye Of The Tiger in the middle of Saving Private Ryan. The suspense of the film is phenomenal especially the fact that this movie is 87 minutes long and you don't see Chucky come alive until 45 minutes in to the movie. the sequels brought him n quicker but this one wants to toy (no pun intended) with its audience whether it is Chucky committimg these crimes or if it is all inside of little Andys head. The Final Verdict for the 1988 film Child's Play is a 4 Out Of 4 Stars and earns my Seal Of Approval meaning I say go out and not only see but buy this movie. This movie not only has a great and original story but also fantastic special effects, terrific acting and awesome voice work by Brad Dourif, this is a must see.I also like the suspense how you do not see the doll come alive until 45 minutes into the film.

The Final Verdict for the 1988 film Child's Play is a 4 Out Of 4 Stars and earns my Seal Of Approval meaning I say go out and not only see but buy this movie. This movie not only has a great and original story but also fantastic special effects, terrific acting and awesome voice work by Brad Dourif, this is a must see.I also like the suspense how you do not see the doll come alive until 45 minutes into the film. This is one doll you do not want to mess with.Rated R For Horror Violence Including Terror And Disturbing Images And For Language.1hr 27min\/87min.3 uses of the F-word.Cost $9,000,000.Box Office $44,196,684.IMDb Rating 6.4\/10.Rotten Tomatoes Rating 68% Fresh.My Rating ****\/**** ","genre":"Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"10 December 2012","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Agnes of God is one of those little gems, which while not overlooked (both Ann Bancroft and Meg Tilly were nominated for their performances), could have received more attention. The reason it did not, I believe, is that it challenges the viewer and takes a serious look at core beliefs, thus automatically taking it out of the mainstream.The film really is about three mutually exclusive, opposing viewpoints and outlooks on life. One side is represented by Meg Tilly, playing the naive, young nun accused of murder, and who represents pure religious ecstacy. The other is played by Ann Bancroft, who plays the mother superior of the convent, and while religious, knows of and is experienced in the world. The last is Jane Fonda, who plays a court-appointed psychiatrist to determine if Meg Tilly is competent to stand trial. She represents the world of secular humanism.On one level the movie is a drama, whose underlying plot is to determine exactly what happened that night when Meg Tilly was discovered with a dead baby. On a deeper level the movie is an examination of how each position -- humanism, religiosity, and religious ecstacy -- views the world.This film is basically an ensemble plot that pits the performances of Fonda, Bancroft and Tilly, and their respective viewpoints, against each other. It is truly a cultural clash of these three orientations where one side attempts to understand the other. Through most of the movie there is no understanding or meeting of the minds, there is conflict and there is only misunderstanding. There is conflict in the movie not just because the screen writers wanted some dramatic tension in the film. These three viewpoint indeed are different points of view where there is little common ground.The legal system must proceed, but Fonda (secular humanism) wants very much to understand the obvious genuineness of Meg Tilly's religious fervor. Is this a reflection of her own (secular humanism's) own vacuity? She works a little harder than she would have done if this were an other case. And the viewer too wants to believe as well. The viewer does not want to believe that Tilly was molested or abused. The viewer's hopes are anchored on the great depth of Tilly's faith. There is enough evidence to make the viewer believe that perhaps Tilly is pure and did not kill the baby, because when she is caught up in her religious zeal, she bleeds. Some of the most poignant scenes in the movie is where, personally confused and conflicted by all the attention paying upon her, Meg Tilly spontaneously bleeds on the palms of her hands. The establishment (Ann Bancroft) will always have an interest in clearing the matter quickly and neatly. Whether the film presented such a resolution only the viewer can answer.All performances are strong and all the main actresses were Oscar-nominated for good reason. Fonda's performance deserved a nomination as well, but she wasn't for whatever reason.This movie is thought-provoking. If there was any movie not meant for casual viewing, it is this one. It deserves five stars for its brilliant treatment on the topic portrayed.
