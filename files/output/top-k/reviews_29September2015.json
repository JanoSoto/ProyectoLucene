I think the opening intertitle said it best a picture with a smile and perhaps, a tear. It was much like many of his other films in that it blends slapstick comedy with an incredible amount of heart. I watch hundreds of films every year, and the number one thing that bothers me is when a film tries to be something it's not. Whether that means it focuses too much on one genre or tries to do way too much with its script, I can assure you that The Kid does not have these issues. I think this is most prevalent when the Tramp, played by Chaplin, is running across rooftops trying to catch up to his adopted son being taken away by the authorities. I laughed multiple times as Chaplin pulls the clumsy Tramp gags he does so well but it was hard to hold back tears a few seconds later as he reunites for a few moments with his son.The performances are also worth mentioning. Jackie Coogan, who plays the five year old boy, John, that Chaplin adopts, really nails the humor. As far as I know it was the first major role for someone so young, and Coogan gives a memorable performance. The scene in which he is breaking windows for his father to fix and constantly running away from the police officer is very reminiscent of so many of Chaplin's gags. Although Coogan was great, Chaplin is why you watch the film, and I think The Kid is about as personal of a performance as you will get from Chaplin. He had just buried his infant son shortly before filming began on The Kid. His performance is evidently flooded with closeted emotion. Even considering my favorite film of his, City Lights, I think The Kid is his most emotionally powerful film.I think the fact that this film came out in 1921, shows just how ahead of its time it was. Before the film and even a little bit after, adult actors were playing child roles. At least Chaplin and the studio had the guts to put their faith in a young five year old, and I think everyone can agree, it paid off. The film does have some dated elements though. For instance, the bully that the Tramp fights is noticeably wearing a stuffed shirt to make him look buff and more intimidating, something that films would never do now-in- days. Considering the bully punches through bricks and takes down a light post with his bare hands, I guess it was worth it. The slapstick comedy angles are very much a figure of silent films in the 20's. The stupidity of some of the fight sequences are both very dated but endlessly entertaining.So even though The Kid can be taken as a slapstick comedy, I think it's the dramatic and thought provoking elements that make the film so special. To a certain extent, this film deals with the age old question of who is qualified to be a parent? Of course, it appears the film does have a happy ending but I wonder what happens next. What happens after the lady gets her son back, does the Tramp lose him forever? What gives her the right to take back her baby after giving it up in the first place? Is the fact that the Tramp poor play a factor into the decision to take the kid away from him? I think it's these questions that make this film more than just a laugh out loud comedy and a film that should be studied and understood to be way ahead of its time. I think that's why I always seem to enjoy Chaplin's films, they deal with political and real life issues without bashing these ideas and opinions over the viewer's heads. To me, The Kid exudes a language unspoken in that it takes on issues and ideas that just weren't looked at in the early 20's. The Kid's balance of humor and heart along with its strong political ideas make it one of Chaplin's best, and certainly his most personal and emotional filled films.9.1\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"29 September 2015","score":"","review":" Having seen several of Charlie Chaplin's films now, The Kid was yet another gem in his long-running list of classic films.

Ben Kingsley is that man, and it's so magnetic a performance, so filled with empathy - or rather, he makes this man such a life-force of good, or always trying to be, or being stubborn in the face of insurmountable odds - he IS Gandhi, in a manner of speaking. All the more remarkable that, despite being from India, he is not of that skin color. Does it matter? Talent, heart, actual filling in a role to a point where color no longer matters, it's the kind of thing that helps to transcend the possibilities in movie acting.That may sound of high praise, though this is a good movie. Maybe not great, and I'll get to why for myself personally in a moment. What is impressive is that director Richard Attenborough engages the audience on a massive scale - this story takes place over a period of 50 years (it also starts at the end, with the assassination of the man in 1948). We see how he was put through racial discrimination and battery at the hands of British imperial forces in South Africa, and started off with his non-violent path of resistance all due to fingerprinting for citizens of India. Then of course it's just a matter of time from little rights like that to making the Alien presence of the British go away. That of course is less easier said and even harder done.It's a struggle that takes place over decades and involves in large part Gandhi winning over an entire nation, piece by piece, speech by speech (at times like that opening act at a rock concert that people don't expect much of, and then wipes everyone else away with what he has to say), and appealing to the better angels of the nature of people. The idea is simple show the barbarism and problems of the way that Imperial rule is done, and don't fight back. We see these historical events unfold, and Gandhi, via Kingsley, has to come in as a voice that is not always seen as reasonable. When some Indians on a protest march fight back against some soldiers and then kill a couple of them in a vengeful rage, Gandhi insists everyone, all over, stop the run-up to get things moving in the fight against the British. And, Gandhi being Gandhi, he hunger strikes until all marching for freedom stops (momentarily). It won't be the last time, either.There's a lot of rich historical moments going on in the film, and a lot of is engaging just on a historical-intellectual level; in a sense it's a good brother\/cousin film to Lawrence of Arabia, also about a man's attempt (kind of successful really) at changing how literally the lines of the map are drawn in a part of the world, and what happens when those very people have to forge new identities. In Arabia it was the cutting-up of countries into what we see today as the Middle East, and in Gandhi it's India and Pakistan. There's intense conflict to mine here, and we see a lot of turmoil in the second half of the film on this level. I also found it remarkable, and the scene itself heartbreaking, that the film's first half ends right at the Intermission point of a gigantic tragedy the slaughter of over a thousand Indian people by British Colonialists (many women and children). Normally the first half of a film will end on a high note (just the year before in Reds it's at the point where Russia gets its revolution and lovers reunite for good, for example). Here, it's somber, and it sets up the tremendous stakes in the second half for this man.What didn't totally connect with me though were those parts around Gandhi, on an emotional level. Kingsley is so good here, and there's a decent performance usually around the corner (Martin Sheen, Candace Bergen), but I wish there was just a little more about the man himself, on a personal level, than we see here. Sure, there is a really intense moment early on where Gandhi and his wife get into an argument - he almost throws her out of the house until she yells sense into him and he realizes what he's doing - and while I naturally didn't expect more of that, I was hoping to see just a little more of Gandhi as the man, on a personal level, than just as his cultural accomplishments. This is not to decry the film too much, but it just lacked a certain something to the pathos overall that kept it from being great.Of course there's exceptions to this - a scene where a hunger-stricken (near death really) Mahatma has to tell a man who thinks he's going to hell for killing someone what to do is awe-inspiring, especially how Kingsley is on such a low-energy level - but it's really about the sweep and scope of this story that makes Gandhi the film it is. If that's fine for you, have at it. Those looking to see the many flaws that have been pointed out about the man in certain history books (or in the negative\/less satisfied comments on IMDb) may not get that. It's a big Oscar-winning biopic, and it does what it does - thankfully there's a performance at the center that is truly great and spectacular, and often for how Kingsley isn't giving big, manic speeches.

","genre":"Biography, Drama, History"},{"date":"29 September 2015","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" From a writing standpoint, this movie is phenomenal. I can understand why this film would be called one of the greatest films ever. It has a lot going for it. However, its slow pacing can often effect my enjoyment of it.After a young screenwriter gets a flat tire, he winds up in the home of a once famous silent actor named Norma Desmond and she ensnares him to have him bring one of her scripts to the big screen and to make her famous again.Old film stars are an interesting topic. Its plot provokes sort of a haunting nightmare for everyone who wants to become a star. Its characters are memorable because of their execution. Norma Desmond is a character who slowly loses her insanity as it is slowly proved that reviving a silent film star isn't exactly the easiest thing to do. The ending shows you just how far she will go and it leaves some haunting thoughts in your head after you watch it. On the other hand though, I did feel that it was a little bit unneeded at first. I didn't feel like it was too necessary but that thought died off quickly.Joe Gillis is a character that we kind of feel sorry for. He stumbles upon her house on accident and he starts to feel that he's stuck at her house. You really can't spoil the ending since it is revealed to us how the film ends at the beginning but it makes us feel sad for what happens to Joe because he was almost able to go back to his old life. However, I can understand why the movie would choose to end like that because it makes it more clear what its message is and it explains to us more about the meaning behind the movie.The film's instrumental soundtrack is neither amazing nor bad. It just serves as a catchy soundtrack and it doesn't expand too much more than that. It isn't that impressive but I didn't notice it to be a distraction so I can't say that it diminished the movie's quality in any way.The acting is great on all parts. Gloria Swanson plays a once popular silent film star who suffers from depression and has made several suicide attempts in the past. Her acting doesn't get too amazing until the final few minutes where she is able to convey several mods at once. However, she does a thoroughly convincing role throughout the movie. William Holden's acting remains above average throughout the film.

I can understand why this film would be called one of the greatest films ever. It has a lot going for it.

Its plot provokes sort of a haunting nightmare for everyone who wants to become a star. Its characters are memorable because of their execution. Norma Desmond is a character who slowly loses her insanity as it is slowly proved that reviving a silent film star isn't exactly the easiest thing to do. The ending shows you just how far she will go and it leaves some haunting thoughts in your head after you watch it. On the other hand though, I did feel that it was a little bit unneeded at first. I didn't feel like it was too necessary but that thought died off quickly.Joe Gillis is a character that we kind of feel sorry for. He stumbles upon her house on accident and he starts to feel that he's stuck at her house. You really can't spoil the ending since it is revealed to us how the film ends at the beginning but it makes us feel sad for what happens to Joe because he was almost able to go back to his old life. However, I can understand why the movie would choose to end like that because it makes it more clear what its message is and it explains to us more about the meaning behind the movie.The film's instrumental soundtrack is neither amazing nor bad. It just serves as a catchy soundtrack and it doesn't expand too much more than that. It isn't that impressive but I didn't notice it to be a distraction so I can't say that it diminished the movie's quality in any way.The acting is great on all parts. Gloria Swanson plays a once popular silent film star who suffers from depression and has made several suicide attempts in the past.

It's sequel, on the other hand, is not only worse than the Phantom Menace, in my eyes, but it also right up there with Batman & Robin, Aliens vs Predator Requiem, and Jurassic Park III (which I'd give a D-, as opposed to D+, now that I think about it), as one of those films that has shown a great franchise, at their low point. The only reason why this was, and still is considered an improvement over it's predecessor, is because it didn't have to live up to the hype set by the original trilogy, like that film did. In my opinion, expectations should not affect the quality of a film, aspects that make films great, mainly story and characters, should, and in terms of those things, Attack of the Clones is a far worse movie than The Phantom Menace.The plot of Star Wars - Episode II Attack of the Clones takes place 10 years after the events of Star Wars - Episode I The Phantom Menace. An assassin attempts to assassinate Senator Padme Amidala, but the assassination is stopped by Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi and his Padawan learner, Anakin Skywalker. Both Jedi then try to track down the assassin to investigate, but as soon as they track her down, she is killed before she can give any information to them. Obi-Wan is then sent to the planet Kamino to investigate the assassination attempts, while Anakin is sent to planet Naboo to protect Padme. As Obi- Wan is investigating, he finds a clone army being produced, with the clones being modeled after bounty hunter Jango Fett. Obi-Wan chases Jango, with his cloned son, Boba, which leads him to planet Genosis, where he meets Count Dooku.I will admit that this film makes a few minor improvements over its predecessor, one of which is that the story is more focused, this time, as the film focuses on an actual main goal, as opposed to The Phantom Menace, which struggled in that aspect. The story is still terrible, though, as for one, there are actually giant plot holes in the film. The biggest one being that i this film, it's revealed that Jedi cannot have any feelings,specifically attraction to someone else. Not only does this pretty much make them one-dimensional, but it also makes no sense, because how can Jedi procreate, if they are not allowed to love? Do they just make clones of themselves? Also, how can the clone troopers be clones of Jango, when they had different heights and voices, in the original trilogy? The biggest problem with Attack of the Clones' plot is the lack of detail (there's also an unexplained prophecy saying that Anakin will bring balance to the force).Of course, lets talk about the romance between Anakin and Padme. I really don't have much new to say, but that doesn't change the fact that Padme falls in love with Anakin, despite doing many inappropriate things to her, such as yelling at her, inappropriately touching her, and admitting that he murdered many woman and children, due to anger. Hayden Christiansen and Natalie Portman, aside from being really bland, in their roles, share no chemistry and their dialogue is laughably bad (I don't like sand).Aside from both of them, the acting is still pretty poor. I did think that Ewan McGregor, Christopher Lee, Frank Oz, and Ian McDiarmid did do good jobs as Obi-Wan, Dooku, Jedi Master Yoda, and Chancellor Palpatine. However, I cannot say the same for Samuel L. Jackson, who is not only underused, but also looks unbelievably bored out of his skull. Temuera Morrison also falls flat as Jango Feet. Like the first prequel, all of the characters are bland, but this time, Anakin is a whiny brat, who complains about Obi-Wan...a lot.I didn't really explain why I though George Lucas' direction in the Phantom Menace was poor, so I'll say that he is really bad at directing actors, as during the action scenes, they all have no expression on their faces. However, whilst The Phantom Menace at least had entertaining action, the action in Attack of the Clones is very repetitive and boring, due to feeling like a bunch of random, oversaturated colors flying on the screen, similar to the action in the Transformers films. The CGI is abysmal here, with so many of the effects looking like they belong in a direct-to-video film, especially the first action scene (which is more of a chase, but whatever).Overall, Star Wars - Episode II Attack of the Clones is a horrible sequel, to an already disappointing film. Aside from a bigger sense of focus, everything is worse. The story is worse, the acting is worse, the characters are worse, the action is worse, the dialogue is worse, the effects are way worse, you probably see where I'm coming from. The Phantom menace may have been more disappointing, but this film makes that film look like The Godfather, by comparison.FINAL VERIDCT D- (ABYSMAL) ","genre":null},{"date":"29 September 2015","score":"4 out of 10 people found the following review useful","review":" Director George LucasWriter George LucasStarring Ewan McGregor, Hayden Christensen, Natale Portman, Ian McDiarmid, Samuel L.

An assassin attempts to assassinate Senator Padme Amidala, but the assassination is stopped by Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi and his Padawan learner, Anakin Skywalker. Both Jedi then try to track down the assassin to investigate, but as soon as they track her down, she is killed before she can give any information to them. Obi-Wan is then sent to the planet Kamino to investigate the assassination attempts, while Anakin is sent to planet Naboo to protect Padme. As Obi- Wan is investigating, he finds a clone army being produced, with the clones being modeled after bounty hunter Jango Fett. Obi-Wan chases Jango, with his cloned son, Boba, which leads him to planet Genosis, where he meets Count Dooku.I will admit that this film makes a few minor improvements over its predecessor, one of which is that the story is more focused, this time, as the film focuses on an actual main goal, as opposed to The Phantom Menace, which struggled in that aspect. The story is still terrible, though, as for one, there are actually giant plot holes in the film. The biggest one being that i this film, it's revealed that Jedi cannot have any feelings,specifically attraction to someone else. Not only does this pretty much make them one-dimensional, but it also makes no sense, because how can Jedi procreate, if they are not allowed to love? Do they just make clones of themselves? Also, how can the clone troopers be clones of Jango, when they had different heights and voices, in the original trilogy? The biggest problem with Attack of the Clones' plot is the lack of detail (there's also an unexplained prophecy saying that Anakin will bring balance to the force).Of course, lets talk about the romance between Anakin and Padme. I really don't have much new to say, but that doesn't change the fact that Padme falls in love with Anakin, despite doing many inappropriate things to her, such as yelling at her, inappropriately touching her, and admitting that he murdered many woman and children, due to anger. Hayden Christiansen and Natalie Portman, aside from being really bland, in their roles, share no chemistry and their dialogue is laughably bad (I don't like sand).Aside from both of them, the acting is still pretty poor. I did think that Ewan McGregor, Christopher Lee, Frank Oz, and Ian McDiarmid did do good jobs as Obi-Wan, Dooku, Jedi Master Yoda, and Chancellor Palpatine. However, I cannot say the same for Samuel L. Jackson, who is not only underused, but also looks unbelievably bored out of his skull. Temuera Morrison also falls flat as Jango Feet. Like the first prequel, all of the characters are bland, but this time, Anakin is a whiny brat, who complains about Obi-Wan...a lot.I didn't really explain why I though George Lucas' direction in the Phantom Menace was poor, so I'll say that he is really bad at directing actors, as during the action scenes, they all have no expression on their faces. However, whilst The Phantom Menace at least had entertaining action, the action in Attack of the Clones is very repetitive and boring, due to feeling like a bunch of random, oversaturated colors flying on the screen, similar to the action in the Transformers films. The CGI is abysmal here, with so many of the effects looking like they belong in a direct-to-video film, especially the first action scene (which is more of a chase, but whatever).Overall, Star Wars - Episode II Attack of the Clones is a horrible sequel, to an already disappointing film. Aside from a bigger sense of focus, everything is worse. The story is worse, the acting is worse, the characters are worse, the action is worse, the dialogue is worse, the effects are way worse, you probably see where I'm coming from.

The night before, he has a Bunuel-esque nightmare that foreshadows his own fate, seeing a watch with no hands, and his own corpse in a coffin. Cleverly, the film hints that he may be out of time before his own mortality claims him, and thus he begins a journey of self discovery where his skeletons reach out from the closet.For my first Bergman film, I was impressed by the crisp presentation and cerebral story. Its not often that filmmakers explore the aging process in sympathetic ways, and this is helped by the characterization of Dr. Isak Borg as an every man which makes him easier to relate to. He's a successful academic, although happiness in his personal life was sacrificed for concentration on his profession. And so Dr. Borg asks the eternal question of whether his existence has had any significance at all. Along the road trip with his daughter in law Marianne (who resents his emotional distancing), they pick up passengers that each represent and harken back to the failures of Borg's past. An old bickering couple that remind him of his unhappy marriage, and a love triangle between two men and a girl who symbolize a lost love from his adolescence. As the memories come flooding back, the old doctor descends into his recollections and subconscious dreams, where suppressed issues come hurtling forth from the depths. His clinical nature and lack of interest in relationships led to his first love leaving him for his brother, and later his wife having a bastard child with another man, who Borg still raised as his own. There is a haunting scene where he takes Marianne to visit his lonely, decrepit mother, and there the audience realizes along with her that this lack of zest for life seems to run through the family; Isak's son is too revealed to be a misanthropic bore, who rejects his wife Marianne's request for a child. The result of his resentfulness at having been raised as an unwanted child himself.The doctor soon learns that the only good he ever accomplished was tied to his medicinal work, but at the cost of living a life of solitude and isolation, a mindset that has afflicted his own son. There is a subtle theme from Bergman that Borg's ignorance of his family and friends has been the result of his turning away from God, as hinted by the young men they pick up (a minister and a doctor, the two sides of Isak's psyche) who fight and debate over its existence.

Cleverly, the film hints that he may be out of time before his own mortality claims him, and thus he begins a journey of self discovery where his skeletons reach out from the closet.For my first Bergman film, I was impressed by the crisp presentation and cerebral story. Its not often that filmmakers explore the aging process in sympathetic ways, and this is helped by the characterization of Dr. Isak Borg as an every man which makes him easier to relate to. He's a successful academic, although happiness in his personal life was sacrificed for concentration on his profession. And so Dr. Borg asks the eternal question of whether his existence has had any significance at all. Along the road trip with his daughter in law Marianne (who resents his emotional distancing), they pick up passengers that each represent and harken back to the failures of Borg's past. An old bickering couple that remind him of his unhappy marriage, and a love triangle between two men and a girl who symbolize a lost love from his adolescence. As the memories come flooding back, the old doctor descends into his recollections and subconscious dreams, where suppressed issues come hurtling forth from the depths. His clinical nature and lack of interest in relationships led to his first love leaving him for his brother, and later his wife having a bastard child with another man, who Borg still raised as his own. There is a haunting scene where he takes Marianne to visit his lonely, decrepit mother, and there the audience realizes along with her that this lack of zest for life seems to run through the family; Isak's son is too revealed to be a misanthropic bore, who rejects his wife Marianne's request for a child. The result of his resentfulness at having been raised as an unwanted child himself.The doctor soon learns that the only good he ever accomplished was tied to his medicinal work, but at the cost of living a life of solitude and isolation, a mindset that has afflicted his own son. There is a subtle theme from Bergman that Borg's ignorance of his family and friends has been the result of his turning away from God, as hinted by the young men they pick up (a minister and a doctor, the two sides of Isak's psyche) who fight and debate over its existence.

","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"29 September 2015","score":"","review":" We are all accustomed to the usual beautiful princess who needs a prince to rescue them; that is not the case for Mulan who proves herself not to be a damsel in distress, but a warrior who saves all of China. She accomplishes this amazing task along with vivid characters and defeats all odds against her. It was not just a film, though, it was an epic depiction based on a true story of Hua Mulan, a real warrior who fought in the invasion of China. The Disney film Mulan captures the timelessness of Ballad of Mulan and reintroduces it in a way that appeals to viewers of all ages, displaying empowerment as a trait all girls can possess, overall an excellent movie with clear cut theme and plot without losing its authenticity. Mulan, released in 1998, was a screenplay written by Robert D. San Souci. Fa Mulan (Ming-Na Wen) was the only child of her ill father Fa Zhou (Soon-Tek Oh) and mother Fa Li (Freda Foh Shen), both decent farmers. The story begins with Mulan having a meeting with the matchmaker to find a suitable husband, but Mulan is not as poised and graceful enough to impress the matchmaker and ultimately dismissed and labeled a disgrace. Soon after her father is summoned by the councilman Chi Fu (James Hong) to serve in battle. Chinese culture collects one male from each family, if the father is summoned, a son can volunteer to assume his position; although in this family, there is no son to volunteer. A brave and determined Mulan, afraid to lose her father, decides she is going to take his place disguising herself as his son. Since women cannot participate in war she had the challenge of concealing her identity as well as living up to expectations as a male warrior. Li Shan (B.D Wong) is assigned to train the recruitments for battle. Mulan was not as trained and skilled as most of the males so she was met with challenges. After training was over with Mulan was at the top of her class, and soon her identity was revealed and she was released from the roster. She was a determined warrior she returned leading to victory against Shan Yu with the help of some friends and began her budding romance with Li Shang. In addition to the incredible Disney film, it's not only for the television screen, the story has roots. Mulan is actually based on a real person and a real account in history. Mulan is based on a ballad written anonymously during the Ming Dynasty telling the legend Hua Mulan. There of course are subtle differences in the ballad and film, such as the fact that Hua Mulan was fairly skilled in weapons and combat, overtly Mulan was not. What makes this fact special is the time period (1368 C.E-1644 C.E.) where there were strict roles that men and women should follow, especially in Chinese culture. But Mulan differed all regulation and ultimately became a popular figure in Chinese history. Selflessly she took the place of her father in risk of being exiled, killed, or worse. It inspired me even, not to allow anything to become a hindrance and to continue to be selfless one day it may be recognized as greatness. Needless to say, the ballad sets the movie apart from any other Disney film. Characterization is important in any film, they give it dynamics and set the tone. This is a critical movie, but the tone can be very light hearted given the vivacious characters. Mulan is given an ancestor spirit in the form of a little red dragon named Mushu (Eddie Murphy) he adds a comical twist although he is very wise. The characters were well thought out and given an identity, even the minor characters were complex. Warriors and friends of Mulan's like Ling, Yao, and Chien-Po were supporting characters who, like Li Shang, learned to accept Mulan's motives and forgive her deceit. Then you have the obvious static character like Shan Yu whose ultimate goal was to kill the last of the Chinese warriors. Moreover, the voice behind the characters were all of Asian descent (given very few exceptions), I found that intriguing and it gave the roles even more distinction. Characterization provided in this film gave the story the tone it needed to reach out to the audience, without losing the culture. This film happens to be a family favorite, it's always on the list when binge watching Disney films. After its release it was nominated for an Oscar award, and ranked number 2 in the box office, rightly so. Without bias this film has been underrated, I believe it gives hope to female youth. It gives off a sense of empowerment and bravery over all odds. In this story you do not need a prince to rescue you from a tower guarded by dragons; in this case the dragon was her accomplice and she saved her prince. If you were to ever ask who my favorite Disney princess is I would tell you Mulan. Although she is not a princess, she has just as much nobility on film and in history.

My love of the movie mostly stems from its characters, most notably the Skeksis. The Skeksis include Emperor SkekSo, Chamberlain SkekSil, General SkekUng, High Priest SkekZok, Scientist SkekTek, Slave Driver SkekNa, Treasurer ShekShod, Gourmand SkekAyuk, Ornamentalist SkekEkt, and Historian SkekOk. The Skeksis also have a group of counterparts known as the Mystics or UrRu, which include Master UrSu, Chanter UrSol, Healer UrIm, Ritual Guardian UrZah, Alchemist UrTih, Herbalist UrNol, Numerologist UrYod, Cook UrAmaj, Weaver UrUtt, and Scribe UrAc. In addition to the Skeksis and Mystics we meet the Podlings, a group of potato-like peasants, the one-eyed astronomer Aughra (a feminization of the word ogre), and protagonists in the form of Gelflings Jen and Kira and their fluffy pet Fizzgig. Jen has been sent on a mission by the dying UrSu, who raised him, and along the way he meets Kira and Fizzgig, Aughra, and the Podlings. But for me, the most fascinating aspect of the movie was the Skeksis and their relationship with the Mystics. While the Mystics are unconcerned with material possessions, the Skeksis are extreme materialists who's very clothes are status symbols. After SkeSil's failed bid for leadership, he's stripped and revealed to be scrawny and bony with bad posture. Just goes to show that the clothes make the man (or monster). The most potent scene for me has got to be the death of the Skeksis Emperor. I actually find myself feeling sorry for SkekSo. The other Skeksis are only interested in power, to the point where SkekSil attempts to take his cane while he's still alive, albeit just barely. Like a 2-year- old, SkekSo grabs his staff and insists I&#x85;am&#x85;still&#x85;Emperor! The Skeksis are vulture capitalists that are actually vultures. This film is so magical that it's hard to believe it was actually made rather than being an item composed of frozen stardust. The Dark Crystal is all at once a fond childhood memory, a rare and beautiful cinematic achievement, an enduring tale of love, trust, and courage, and a masterpiece and a cornerstone of my heart.

","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"29 September 2015","score":"","review":" Released in 1982 in a 5-hour version for Swedish television and cut to 180 minutes for theatrical release, FANNY AND Alexander was meant to be Ingmar Bergman's last film. Though the great auteur lived on another 25 years and even wrote and directed some smaller projects, FANNY AND Alexander can still be seen as a great capstone to decades of legendary cinema.FANNY AND Alexander deals with the great two preoccupations of Bergman's career, namely the absence of God and the unbridgeable gaps between human beings, but the result is wonderfully life-affirming. Fanny and Alexander are the children of Oscar and Emilie Ekdahl, actors in Uppsala circa 1907, but the film gives a panorama of the extended Ekdahl family, presided over by grandmother Helena, uncles Gustav Adolf (a restaurateur and the film's most comedic presence) and Carl (a professor who has fallen into debt and is trapped in a loveless marriage), their wives and children, and the selfless Jewish shopkeeper Isak Jacobi. This Swedish family lives in an Old World opulence that is hard to believe for audiences today, especially for a country whose class system by and large disappeared after the war. The rigid interaction among people not closely acquainted and the deference of servants to their employers make for gestures as alien to us 21st century viewers as a Noh play.In a way, FANNY AND Alexander is like those big novels of a century ago, by Tolstoy or Galsworthy, dealing with the vicissitudes of a whole family. The vaster family drama, however, is only a backdrop to a more personal one Fanny and Alexander are soon orphaned, and their widowed mother eventually remarries, this time with a cruel clergyman. The children move from the freedom and comfort of the Ekdahl home to the austere bishop's place, where the children are punished for the slightest infraction by beatings or being locked up in the attic. The Ekdahls' torment living under the bishop is the great crisis of the film, and their unexpected liberation from it presents Alexander with a burden that he will carry into his budding manhood.The original television version is the way to see Bergman's final masterpiece. Don't be daunted by the length 5 hours should not be a problem in an age when people will watch an entire season of a sitcom on DVD in one sitting. FANNY AND Alexander is not slow, meditative cinema like, say, Andrei Tarkovsky or Béla Tarr, but rather Bergman is always presenting the viewer with some engaging little drama. The theatrical cut, which Bergman made only with the greatest regret, is a very different (and much weaker film), cutting out much of the film's magical realism, the touching meditations on growing old represented by the character of the grandmother, and some vivid depictions of early 20th-century Sweden.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"29 September 2015","score":"","review":" I would love to say that I liked this movie but unfortunately, I cannot. I have not read the novel and it was only after a class discussion on the film that I understood what was happening. After the discussion, it became clear how the film illustrates the central themes of Anna Karennina, particularly the changing role of women in society as well as an analysis of family and relationships. The double standards between men and women are clearly shown in the film, most evidently with Anna and her brother, who experience totally different circumstances as a result of almost identical behavior involving adultery and the pursuit of divorce. Anna is relegated to a life of shame in which she cannot leave the house, let alone care for her son, while her brother and Vronsky are still respected in society and able to do what they please. In fact, Vronsky's involvement in the affair works to his advantage if he chose to leave Anna, though she is completely dependent on him.Furthermore, the juxtaposition of Anna's story and that of Levin serves to emphasize Tolstoy's deconstruction of family life and relationships. It is clear that their stories are polar opposites at all times. While Levin was alone and unhappy in the beginning, Anna was just beginning her passionate affair with Vronsky. In the end, Levin has a son with a loving wife while Anna loses her child, her husband, and eventually her life.Another critical aspect of the story that can be seen in the movie is the modernization of Russia and whether Russia would embrace or reject it. There are multiple demonstrations of modernization in the film, including the important role of trains in the storyline. This is also clear in the scene where Levin and his peasants work the land using traditional tools instead of more advanced plowing technology that was available at the time. Levin's appreciation of the traditional method and how peacefully they completed the task could show the rejection of modernization in that moment.Levin's character in general is a representation of Tolstoy himself, as demonstrated at the end when he signed the letter as Tolstoy. It was interesting how the film took it one step further by having Levin sign his name as such. Apparently Tolstoy also preferred the countryside and was close to his peasants. The representation of Tolstoy within Levin is also made abundantly clear in the two scenes where Levin attempts to identifies and attempts to answer philosophical questions. These include the accursed questions that were an integral part of Tolstoy's philosophy.Overall, the story and characters as envisioned by Tolstoy are great, but this film adaption did not do a good job of communicating the above ideas. The film itself provides no context or explanation for the plot or characters, and does a terrible job in portraying the characters in a way where one can empathize with and understand them. This is definitely a film that requires prior knowledge of the story and characters to be appreciated.
