I thought it was a fantastic film, with a really cool story, great action, cool actors, decent acting and some great bits of comedy.Sylvester Stallone was the PERFECT choice for the role of Judge Dredd!  He completely fits the mold and does an outstanding job portraying Judge Dredd.  Rob Schnieder was an excellent choice for the part of Herman Ferguson as well.  Rob added a great deal of comedy to the film and it was all good comedy, nothing terribly cheesy or annoying, just perfect.  Diane Lane looks nothing short of fabulous throughout the film, and pulls off a fine performance as well.  Max von Sydow is not someone I would expect to be in a film like this, but nonetheless, I'm glad he did, because he did a fantastic job.  Armand Assante was excellent in the antagonist position.  He makes and excellent bad guy, I'd love to see him in more films.  The rest of the cast was good as well.The special effects in the film are very good for the most part, there's nothing much to complain about.  The thing that completely made this film for me is the ABC Warbot.  What a beautiful design!  Truly fantastic!!!  The only thing I would have liked to see is a long shot of the Warbot walking, but I'm sure with the budget of the film that was virtually impossible, so I'll deal with it.  But all the scenes with the Warbot are just fantastic!I don't really see why people tend to dislike this film.  I thought it was an all around fun movie with plenty of good things going for it.  I would definitely recommend this film to anyone that like super-hero movies, or just futuristic action films.  I hope that you like this film as much as I do.

He completely fits the mold and does an outstanding job portraying Judge Dredd.  Rob Schnieder was an excellent choice for the part of Herman Ferguson as well.  Rob added a great deal of comedy to the film and it was all good comedy, nothing terribly cheesy or annoying, just perfect.  Diane Lane looks nothing short of fabulous throughout the film, and pulls off a fine performance as well.  Max von Sydow is not someone I would expect to be in a film like this, but nonetheless, I'm glad he did, because he did a fantastic job.  Armand Assante was excellent in the antagonist position.  He makes and excellent bad guy, I'd love to see him in more films.  The rest of the cast was good as well.The special effects in the film are very good for the most part, there's nothing much to complain about.  The thing that completely made this film for me is the ABC Warbot.  What a beautiful design!  Truly fantastic!!!  The only thing I would have liked to see is a long shot of the Warbot walking, but I'm sure with the budget of the film that was virtually impossible, so I'll deal with it.  But all the scenes with the Warbot are just fantastic!I don't really see why people tend to dislike this film.  I thought it was an all around fun movie with plenty of good things going for it.  I would definitely recommend this film to anyone that like super-hero movies, or just futuristic action films.  I hope that you like this film as much as I do.

'Til this day, I still love the air guitar gag and I find myself doing the air guitar along with them whenever those scenes come up.While many didn't know who the hell Keanu Reeves was until Point Break or Speed, I still know him as Ted Theodore Logan.  He seems most at home with his role, as he gets to say dude after almost every line of dialogue.  This movie makes me wonder what happened to Alex Winter.  I know he wrote, directed and starred in a cult favorite called Freaked a couple years later, which I only saw in parts, but afterwards he disappeared.  I guess the B & T movies didn't give him as big a springboard as Keanu, who went on to become a megastar.  Joss Ackland makes a fun over-the-top villain and William Sadler is a dryly humorous grim reaper.    The humor is low-brow, yet never obnoxious.  It's all done in good taste, and the film maintains a certain charm.  I love most of the dialogue.  One of my favorites is, Hey man, don't fear the reaper, followed by the air guitar gag.  The Uranus line also cracks me up constantly.  I guess what makes these films work are the Bill and Ted characters themselves.  They're very fun-loving characters, who are quite dim-witted but at the same time lovable.  They're not contrived characters, in which their whole schtick depends on the fact that they're stupid and that the screenwriters simply don't have any good ideas.  I always have fun watching the movie, even on countless repeat viewings.  It's funny, it's harmless and just plain rocks.  The music is great as well.  The film ends with a cool rendition of God Gave Rock and Roll to You.  I'm sure I'm about to read a bunch of reviews saying this film's stupid and this film has no class.

I laughed for that reason too, but more importantly, I found this movie extremely hilarious.Perhaps it is my sadistic sense of humour, I don't know, but it's funny how the producers of this stupid, brainless horror movie could think of such creative ways to kill off their irritating characters whom nobody really care about. A good example would be the death of the teacher, whatever her name is. That scene nearly killed me, pun fully intended, especially when she needed help to actually get herself totally killed.Final Destination had a great premise. It just had an extremely lousy and predictable execution. What could've been a truly terrifying movie about the inevitability of death and the suffering one goes through living with that knowledge became a rehashed, one-dimensional joke of a movie that had elements of previously and equally bad slasher movies in it. Its greatest flaw was its cardboard cut-out characters. With the exception of Devon Sawa and Ali Larter, the cast looked like they were picked from unwanted extras who failed to make it to the latest teenage flick. The characters irritated the living bejesus out of me because they were whining so much that I just wanted them to get killed already and put me out of my agony of watching such stupidity. The jock was predictably cocky, his girlfriend predictably bitchy, and the rest of them? Don't even remember.The only good part about the movie is Devon Sawa and Ali Larter. Sawa is a good actor whose talent was wasted on playing a silly character, while Larter, whom I've never seen before prior to this, was surprisingly convincing as Clear Rivers (Clear? What kind of a name is CLEAR?!). She was pleasantly understated and provided a nice break from Alex's perpetual high-strungness, so to speak. The chemistry between them also helped to make the love angle that just HAD to be present a tad less sickening.Still, it was obvious that this movie existed for no reason other than to rake in the cash at the box office, which should explain the extreme gore factor.

I laughed for that reason too, but more importantly, I found this movie extremely hilarious.Perhaps it is my sadistic sense of humour, I don't know, but it's funny how the producers of this stupid, brainless horror movie could think of such creative ways to kill off their irritating characters whom nobody really care about. A good example would be the death of the teacher, whatever her name is. That scene nearly killed me, pun fully intended, especially when she needed help to actually get herself totally killed.Final Destination had a great premise. It just had an extremely lousy and predictable execution. What could've been a truly terrifying movie about the inevitability of death and the suffering one goes through living with that knowledge became a rehashed, one-dimensional joke of a movie that had elements of previously and equally bad slasher movies in it. Its greatest flaw was its cardboard cut-out characters. With the exception of Devon Sawa and Ali Larter, the cast looked like they were picked from unwanted extras who failed to make it to the latest teenage flick. The characters irritated the living bejesus out of me because they were whining so much that I just wanted them to get killed already and put me out of my agony of watching such stupidity. The jock was predictably cocky, his girlfriend predictably bitchy, and the rest of them? Don't even remember.The only good part about the movie is Devon Sawa and Ali Larter. Sawa is a good actor whose talent was wasted on playing a silly character, while Larter, whom I've never seen before prior to this, was surprisingly convincing as Clear Rivers (Clear? What kind of a name is CLEAR?!). She was pleasantly understated and provided a nice break from Alex's perpetual high-strungness, so to speak. The chemistry between them also helped to make the love angle that just HAD to be present a tad less sickening.Still, it was obvious that this movie existed for no reason other than to rake in the cash at the box office, which should explain the extreme gore factor.

I've seen few films that deserve that title.  Of course there are great films out there.   I love FARGO and I love 12 Monkeys for example.  But no film I've ever seen deserves as much high praise as TERRY GILLIAM'S (12 Monkeys) BRAZIL.  A film about the postmodern age created for the postmodern age.It's amazing how one word can change meaning of any statement.  In BRAZIL, there is a stone with the statement, `THE TRUTH SHALL MAKE YOU FREE' scrawled on it.  In the world of BRAZIL there is no truth.  Only Fear. The world is run by one large corporation, Central Services, and like all mammoth corporations, nothing goes right, but in the stockholders meeting everything's A-okay.  Funny how propaganda works, don't you think?As the film opens we meet Sam Lowery (Johnathan Pryce, EVITA) a young man with idealistic dreams, and very low expectations out of his life.   He just wants to spend his day working at his job, and his nights dreaming.  His overbearing mother (Katharine Helmond, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas) mother wants him to climb the corporate ladder.  Poor Sam, he just wants to be left alone.When a computer error executes the wrong man.  Sam is given the task to issue the man's wife a refund.  For in this world you pay for your execution and imprisonment. This sets off a course of events that brings Sam closer to his dreams, closer to finding love, and closer to finding the fulfillment in life he desperately desires.  What is the cost of that fulfillment? Especially in the nightmare world central services has created?  That's up to you to decide.BRAZIL is a gripping story.  With so many ideas crammed into every frame. It's the kind of movie that you can watch many times, cause each moment there is a nugget of truth, an idea, or some really inventive plot twist you didn't see before.  It's also full of laughs.  But since the humor is dark it may take a couple of viewings for you to notice them.  But by the end of this film you want to watch it again.This is also a great character movie.  Pryce is delightful as Sam Lowery. He's the perfect person to play the guy who tows the company line and yet wants to soar free as a bird.  There is this vulnerability about him; you really want to root for him.  But you can see he's about to snap at any moment.The most Brilliant performance is that of Michael Palin (Monty Python's Meaning of Life) as Jack Lint.  A nice guy, with a horrible job, he has to torture everyone who is arrested and you watch as this job gives him security and a family, but it begins to take its toll.   Gilliam gives him this great moment where he's just killed a man, and there in the next room is his daughter playing with toys.  You can see him try to drown out the voices of the hundreds he's killed.  But it's beginning to unravel.  It's a brilliant sequence.Robert Deniro (Analyze That) also stars as Harry Tuttle, a renegade heating repairman.  It's a really funny cameo.  There is a sequence that is both disgusting and hilariously funny, and it's Deniro's smirk that makes that sequence priceless.  `Hey We're All In It Together,' he quips.Director Gilliam and Cinematographer Roger Pratt (Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets), create a world that is stunningly beautiful when it needs to be. Dull and immense when it has to be. Cold and claustrophobic when the characters call for it and Dark and scary when it has to be. There is a melding of what I can only explain as THE WIZARD OF OZ meets film Noir. It's a signature look that is unlike any other film I've ever seen.What Gillian does with models could never be faithfully reproduced with computers.  Sam's fight with the giant samurai is breathtaking.  His flight as Icarus is probably one of the greatest pictures ever filmed, and the final shot is both comic and disturbing all at the same time.  This movie looks so good.The screenplay is also great.  With writing credits by Tom Stoppard (Enigma), Charles McKeown (The Adventures of Baron Munchausen), and Gilliam himself.  It has a great balance between comedy and drama.  This is necessary for it's satire to work.   We laugh, we cry, and we love these characters.  Even if we hate them.This film also features a great score by Michael Kamen (X-Men), a mix between classical and modern styles, helps to create a picture's that are so beautiful.BRAZIL is my number 1 favorite film.  I could probably go on for pages about each sequence.

I've seen few films that deserve that title.  Of course there are great films out there.   I love FARGO and I love 12 Monkeys for example.  But no film I've ever seen deserves as much high praise as TERRY GILLIAM'S (12 Monkeys) BRAZIL.  A film about the postmodern age created for the postmodern age.It's amazing how one word can change meaning of any statement.  In BRAZIL, there is a stone with the statement, `THE TRUTH SHALL MAKE YOU FREE' scrawled on it.  In the world of BRAZIL there is no truth.  Only Fear. The world is run by one large corporation, Central Services, and like all mammoth corporations, nothing goes right, but in the stockholders meeting everything's A-okay.  Funny how propaganda works, don't you think?As the film opens we meet Sam Lowery (Johnathan Pryce, EVITA) a young man with idealistic dreams, and very low expectations out of his life.   He just wants to spend his day working at his job, and his nights dreaming.  His overbearing mother (Katharine Helmond, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas) mother wants him to climb the corporate ladder.  Poor Sam, he just wants to be left alone.When a computer error executes the wrong man.  Sam is given the task to issue the man's wife a refund.  For in this world you pay for your execution and imprisonment. This sets off a course of events that brings Sam closer to his dreams, closer to finding love, and closer to finding the fulfillment in life he desperately desires.  What is the cost of that fulfillment? Especially in the nightmare world central services has created?  That's up to you to decide.BRAZIL is a gripping story.  With so many ideas crammed into every frame. It's the kind of movie that you can watch many times, cause each moment there is a nugget of truth, an idea, or some really inventive plot twist you didn't see before.  It's also full of laughs.  But since the humor is dark it may take a couple of viewings for you to notice them.  But by the end of this film you want to watch it again.This is also a great character movie.  Pryce is delightful as Sam Lowery. He's the perfect person to play the guy who tows the company line and yet wants to soar free as a bird.  There is this vulnerability about him; you really want to root for him.  But you can see he's about to snap at any moment.The most Brilliant performance is that of Michael Palin (Monty Python's Meaning of Life) as Jack Lint.  A nice guy, with a horrible job, he has to torture everyone who is arrested and you watch as this job gives him security and a family, but it begins to take its toll.   Gilliam gives him this great moment where he's just killed a man, and there in the next room is his daughter playing with toys.  You can see him try to drown out the voices of the hundreds he's killed.  But it's beginning to unravel.  It's a brilliant sequence.Robert Deniro (Analyze That) also stars as Harry Tuttle, a renegade heating repairman.  It's a really funny cameo.  There is a sequence that is both disgusting and hilariously funny, and it's Deniro's smirk that makes that sequence priceless.  `Hey We're All In It Together,' he quips.Director Gilliam and Cinematographer Roger Pratt (Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets), create a world that is stunningly beautiful when it needs to be. Dull and immense when it has to be. Cold and claustrophobic when the characters call for it and Dark and scary when it has to be. There is a melding of what I can only explain as THE WIZARD OF OZ meets film Noir. It's a signature look that is unlike any other film I've ever seen.What Gillian does with models could never be faithfully reproduced with computers.  Sam's fight with the giant samurai is breathtaking.  His flight as Icarus is probably one of the greatest pictures ever filmed, and the final shot is both comic and disturbing all at the same time.  This movie looks so good.The screenplay is also great.  With writing credits by Tom Stoppard (Enigma), Charles McKeown (The Adventures of Baron Munchausen), and Gilliam himself.  It has a great balance between comedy and drama.  This is necessary for it's satire to work.   We laugh, we cry, and we love these characters.  Even if we hate them.This film also features a great score by Michael Kamen (X-Men), a mix between classical and modern styles, helps to create a picture's that are so beautiful.BRAZIL is my number 1 favorite film.  I could probably go on for pages about each sequence.

However, it is so giddy over itself and so shamelessly self referential it's hard not to go along with it. If only just to see what it has up it's sleeve. While many movies throw in winks and nods at itself to cover up for it's lack of originality, 'R&B' is through-and-through, without a doubt a parody of itself. Just as the original TV show was. It's best and funniest moments come in the opening animated sequence and often from the narrator - I don't really care for that dumb Moose and flying squirrel to much.The cast...well, I don't know. Robert DeNiro, Jason Alexander and Rene Russo certainly cover their cartoonish characters perfectly, but at the same time it's also a little embarrassing seeing such fine thespians rolling around in this. Piper Perabo shines with the least to loose and delivers one of the cutest performances ever put on film (it's a small category). The direction is creative. We are given some stunning scenes of animation - like Bullwinkle literally surfing the internet. The live-action\/animation mix is not quite as seamless as Who Framed Roger Rabbit? (also referenced in this movie) but it's the best since then. The whole movie is ahead of the rest of it's pack by the writing. The script is sharp. It throws lines at us with a rapid fire pace - sarcastic, ironic and occasionally laugh-out-loud-despite-yourself funny. Much of it will go over the heads of the target kid audience. I love Janeane Garofalo as a movie studio executive tossing out scripts she deems to intelligent. Yes, it's hollow, lacks any character development, is an endless parade of cameos (we could have done without those Kenan and Kel kids), is ridiculously anti-climactic, filled with plot holes, doesn't give us much of an original idea and will probably be forgotten 5 minutes later... but it's supposed to be like that. It makes for a great diverting romp. What can I say - the damn thing's critic proof.
