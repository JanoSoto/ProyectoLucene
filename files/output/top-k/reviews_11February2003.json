It's one of those films which creates a mood and leaves you thinking about it for days afterwards, kind of alters the way you look at things. I think that is what film making at its best is all about.Cube is a terrifying film, a kind of Orwell\/ Huxley nightmare. Somehow a group of people have been trapped in an endless maze of cubic rooms some containing the most lethal traps. Their task, presumably - they are given no instructions - is to avoid the traps and find the exit before they die of hunger and thirst. It's a terrifying thought that innocent people can be taken from their own homes in the middle of the night and transported to such a cruel and devilishly sophisticated experiment. You wonder who could have the power to do such a thing the characters speculate, government, a Bond style supervillain? but they never can find out for sure, no evil genius ever presents himself and indeed it would be a total letdown if they did. The main character in the story is the implacible Cube itself, an endless 3D maze of 14ft-on-a-side cubic rooms each with 6 exits to ajacent rooms (including ceiling and floor). There are no windows of course and each room is lit by its glowing walls. Different rooms have different colours, red, blue, green and white and this brilliantly adds to the eerie feel and look of the film. Each coloured room has an atmosphere of its own, the white ones of definitely the most cheery, its as bright as daylight and you can see the colours clearly but there is no guarantee that a white room doesn't contain a trap, in fact there seems to be no correspondance between colours and traps, that would be too easy.But there is a way to get through the maze, each room has a number written along its edges and its possible to work out a way out from that, provided you have enough mathematical ability. The cube is already mathematical in terms of being such an ideal geometric structure and this number theory twist adds greatly to the intrigue. It involves the audience as they try to solve the puzzle themselves and also gives the characters something to do. Some of the characters - is it coincidence - do have mathematical ability.There are five characters in the film, as you might expect they are an eclectic bunch with more than usual amounts of emotional problems and eccentricities. Imagine waking up in a cubic room with nothing but identical rooms all around! After coping with the shock and rising terror, the characters set off to find a way out and naturally different personalities start to assert themselves. Some characters are natural leaders others are more thoughtful. Some hopeful of a way out, others just despair accepting death as inevitable. It turns out that one if tangentially responsible for building the cube in the first place adding to the paranoid feeling that NO ONE IS SAFE.The acting in this film is excellent, you really believe in the whole cube concept from the start. The actors really make you feel how frightening and disorienting it would be and there is superbly believable and fascinating interactions between them as they each find their place in this frightened little group. Although they cope well there is throughout a sense of underlying tension, a feeling of just-controlled panic, which is exactly how you would feel in that situation! There is good character development too as the movie goes on and we find out more about each character's lives and personalities.The directing and cinematography of the film are superb, the whole concept of Cube is just amazing and the visuals do full justice to it. The look of the film is reminiscent of Kubrick at his most spooky and disorienting. There is one scene in particular where the characters are trying to get though a sound-activated trap. One by one they crawl through it in total silence gesturing to each other. I was scared to make any sound myself, it was completely electric! It takes a daring director to have five minutes of silence in a film and this really paid off. It reminded my particularly of 2001 EVA scenes.If I have a complaint at all it is about the ending. I wont reveal it of course, but I would have prepared something happier. After all they've been through, I would have preferred to see the characters succeed, especially cynical worth and the mathematical girl, they really deserved to get out.

Sunset Boulevard is a fantastic example of artistry gone horribly wrong and selling yourself out for the betterment of yourself.  All four main characters, Norma, Joe, Max and Betty are definite characterizations of four different types of person in Hollywood. Norma is of course the faded silent screen star so desperate upon making a comeback that in essence it just kills her and everyone around her.  Joe is the down and out, very desperate screenwriter who stumbles upon Norma and falls head first under her spell.  By the time he gets sucked into her web, it is almost madness as to why he cannot extricate himself from her grip.  Max is the humble butler, who unlike so many other people has come crawling back to Norma because he simply cannot live without her.  So, in essence he takes a menial job just to continue to stay with her in one form or another.  Betty is the one ray of sunlight in an otherwise dark and foreboding world that threatens to crush anyone that gets ensnared in it for too long (i. e. the Hollywood system).  But even so, her light is almost snuffed out towards the end of the film.  We never really get to see what happens to her afterwards.I think what makes this film so great is its ability to wear its heart upon its sleeve.  It is an unflinching portrait of what Hollywood once was (and is no longer) but some of the vestiges from this film can still be seen today.  The bitterness and the knife-edge cynicism (not to mention the acting) is what, I think, draws so many people back to it for repeated viewings, myself included.  For even if we've seen this film before, we can always see it again and pick up on certain things that we never noticed the first time around.  For example, the home that the filmmakers used as Norma's mansion was also used a few years later in Nicholas Ray's Rebel Without A Cause. Gloria Swanson gives a heart-rending performance as Norma Desmond, the silent screen star so desperate to make a comeback.  This film was sort of a comeback for her, having been out of the public eye since the early thirties.  She albeit succeeded but however, she failed to win the coveted Best Actress award at the Oscars that year (1951).  The prize even eluded both Bette Davis and Anne Baxter from All About Eve and went to newcomer Judy Holliday as ditzy blonde Billie Dawn in Born Yesterday.  Frankly, putting both Swanson and Davis in the same category, I have to say that Bette Davis did actually give the better performance that year, but Swanson's Norma is still a character and a force to be reckoned with!Sunset Boulevard lost out to All About Eve, the Hollywood masterpiece about the Broadway stage, at the Oscars that year.  Hollywood wasn't ready to award itself because some people didn't care for the way that the film was portraying itself (showing the dark, seamy side).

Made in 1962, on a modest budget of $13,000, and filmed in only three weeks, this film manages to make you chill in very much the same way NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD did six years later.  The difference in the two I think lies in the fact that this film lies on a much more deeper, resonant level which actually makes you think while the latter goes for the throat in the terms of the horror and gore.  This is one of those rare horror films that relies on atmosphere and suspense and succeeds on virtually every level, and despite the fact it had limited release and unheard of after a few years, by 1989 a demand for a re-release had come about after it had played quite a bit on late night television.  Many of the original cast and crew were reunited and they probably had no clue how it had come about.  In 2000, the highly respected Criterion corporation released a 2-disc DVD that is a true treasure for fans of the film and wonderful introduction to those that have never seen it....and I'm particulary talking to everyone who spent $300 on going to see THE SIXTH SENSE and make their own judgement as to how far director M. Night Shymalan borrowed from this to make SENSE his own. The story focuses on a beautiful young woman (Candice Hilligoss) who somehow surivives a drag-racing accident she had gotten into with some local friends.  She is a church organist, who feels compelled to leave her hometown in Kansas (probably to leave this accident behind in her mind) and soon finds herself pursued by strange, white-faced phantom figure (played by director Herk Harvey).  She also finds herself drawn to an abondoned Salt Lake City carnival by forces she can't comprehend, particularly when they make her lose touch with reality. The movie is relatively short; the original version clocks in at 78 minutes, and the Director's cut released in 1989 is five minutes longer, which adds mostly more shots of the zombielike creatures who terrorize her near the end and some more dialogue by Hilligoss with the doctor, and the friend who suggests a drag race at the beginning of the film.  Still, the film stands out in the genre of horror films on many levels and should be studied by any person out there who wants to make horror or independent films.  The performances are unifirmly superb starting with Hilligoss who plays her part as real as any other person would in her situation, trying to enjoy life and at the same time, figuring out where she is in terms of reality. Sidney Berger gives a wonderful performance as a guy who pursues Hilligoss in another manner; Roger Ebert described his character as being the pivotal example of a nerd in lust.  Even Hervey himself being an amateur actor has the right look and nuance as this ghoul who enters in to Hilligoss' life. As with NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and Roman Polanski's REPULSION (my personal fav in the horror genre) the film's shoestring production manages to bring it to life and manages to be an element of its brilliance rather than detracting from it and being looked as just amaterish.  Recently, I put this film as one of the top 10 cult films of all time, the first being BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS, if you are interested.  Check out this genuninely creepy film and you shouldn't be disappointed.

This is one of those rare horror films that relies on atmosphere and suspense and succeeds on virtually every level, and despite the fact it had limited release and unheard of after a few years, by 1989 a demand for a re-release had come about after it had played quite a bit on late night television.  Many of the original cast and crew were reunited and they probably had no clue how it had come about.  In 2000, the highly respected Criterion corporation released a 2-disc DVD that is a true treasure for fans of the film and wonderful introduction to those that have never seen it....and I'm particulary talking to everyone who spent $300 on going to see THE SIXTH SENSE and make their own judgement as to how far director M. Night Shymalan borrowed from this to make SENSE his own. The story focuses on a beautiful young woman (Candice Hilligoss) who somehow surivives a drag-racing accident she had gotten into with some local friends.  She is a church organist, who feels compelled to leave her hometown in Kansas (probably to leave this accident behind in her mind) and soon finds herself pursued by strange, white-faced phantom figure (played by director Herk Harvey).  She also finds herself drawn to an abondoned Salt Lake City carnival by forces she can't comprehend, particularly when they make her lose touch with reality. The movie is relatively short; the original version clocks in at 78 minutes, and the Director's cut released in 1989 is five minutes longer, which adds mostly more shots of the zombielike creatures who terrorize her near the end and some more dialogue by Hilligoss with the doctor, and the friend who suggests a drag race at the beginning of the film.  Still, the film stands out in the genre of horror films on many levels and should be studied by any person out there who wants to make horror or independent films.  The performances are unifirmly superb starting with Hilligoss who plays her part as real as any other person would in her situation, trying to enjoy life and at the same time, figuring out where she is in terms of reality. Sidney Berger gives a wonderful performance as a guy who pursues Hilligoss in another manner; Roger Ebert described his character as being the pivotal example of a nerd in lust.  Even Hervey himself being an amateur actor has the right look and nuance as this ghoul who enters in to Hilligoss' life. As with NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and Roman Polanski's REPULSION (my personal fav in the horror genre) the film's shoestring production manages to bring it to life and manages to be an element of its brilliance rather than detracting from it and being looked as just amaterish.

The DVD (2001) is especially nice because of the very clear picture, but also the several extras which includes a 76-minute feature on Sturges himself, and how he changed movies forever. He is credited with introducing irony into film, and the snappy, humorous dialog that was his trademark.  He was also the first writer that was allowed to direct his own film. His window of success was very narrow, spanning only a few years, but it was significant.following comments contain SPOILERS - do not read before seeing the film.Sullivan's Travels can be seen as a fictional account of Sturges' own experiences. Wanting to make a drama based on the poor and oppressed (OH Brother, Where Art Thou?), Sullivan's handlers convinced him he did not have the life experiences for that. So he (Joel McCrea)set out to get them, dressed up as a bum, accompanied by pretty and down on her luck actress (petite and pretty Veronica Lake). Through an unexpected turn, he ends up in jail, sentenced to 6 years of labor, while all his associates thought he was dead, killed by a train. But it was a bum they found, maimed by a train, who had stolen Sullivan's shoes.Sullivan's transformation came while attending a movie, chained to other prisoners, at a local black church. It was a Mickey Mouse cartoon and, as he observed all the prisoners laughing, realized that comedy was needed, not another drama about the oppressed. Real life Sturges realized the same thing, and his efforts changed movie making.So, how to get out of prison and back to movie making?  He pleaded guilty to having murdered Sullivan (himself), apparently solving the mystery. He knew that would get his picture in the paper and, sure enough, his pretty girl recognized him, he was freed, and returned to movie making with comedies. He had been married, only for tax purposes, in a scheme by his former manager. His wife had already remarried and the potential scandal freed him to be with his pretty friend, forever!In many respects this film was as important to film making in general as Citizen Kane was.  It is black and white, the shooting and editing are crisp, the dialog is smart. Morality was different back then, as the main characters did not even consider an intimate relationship, even though Sullivan's marriage was a sham. An example of the smart dialog, a play was being discussed and mentioned that it didn't run very long in Pittsburgh. One actor mentioned Don't you think people in Pittsburgh know what they like? Sullivan replied, If they did, they wouldn't stay in Pittsburgh.  We may take that kind of humor for granted today, but in 1941 it was revolutionary.

I was always so busy and anyway, the talk of dog fighting put me off.  But after hearing so many glowing recommendations, I finally got around to renting it on DVD.Set in Mexico and focusing on three separate yet interwoven stories, the film uses a terrible car crash as a jumping off point.In the first segment a young man, Octavio, (played by the superb Gael Garcia) is in love with his abusive brother's wife.  He wants to raise enough money for them to run away together so he uses his beloved dog 'Cofi' and gets involved in the violent world of dog fighting.   The second act tells the tale of a supermodel whose lover leaves his wife and daughters to set up home with her.  She is devoted to her terrior 'Richie' and is devastated when he disappears through a hole in the floor and doesn't return.  Throughout both of these segments we catch glimpses of a transient, scruffy character who is perpetually surrounded by a pack of adoring dogs, and we finally learn his story in the third and final act. At three hours, the structure of the film is impressive, especially as it begins at a frenetic pace and then slows down somewhat - but it leads us to a satisfying conclusion.  The soundtrack in particular is brilliant, as is the acting, writing, photography and design.'Amores Perros' is as the title states, a film about love, and all types of love. Blind love, foolish love, familial love, co-dependant love, unrequited love, parental love, thwarted love, sexual love - it's all there and played out through the love the principal characters have for their pet dogs.  In one way the film examines the human 'animal instinct', the human capacity for violence and our deep seated need for survival.   It is a huge, sprawling piece which is exhilarating, visceral, violent, heartbreaking, funny, passionate, vibrant and urgent. Films like this don't come along very often.  You really should see it.

But boy, is it a good one! Another viewer used the expression tour de force and that struck me as the best description of this cinematic treat. This movie, which might appear at first glance to be little more than a fluffy romantic comedy, turns out to be a virtuoso display of filmmaking, one which can be watched again and again for the superb level of detail, and just for the sheer pleasure of watching it unfold. Seeing this film for the Nth time reminded me once again what an American treasure Jonathan Demme is, truly one of the most talented, daring and distinctive filmmakers working today. Nobody is better at portraying issues of class than Demme, and it's the idea of social class, supposedly nonexistent in America, that's provides the tension at the heart of this movie. Jeff Daniels portrays a stereotypical uptight Wall Street yuppie who acts out his rebellious fantasies by occasionally leaving restaurants without paying his check. Melanie Griffith is the downtown urban hipster woman who catches him in the act and tempts him into a real act of (equally senseless) rebellion, abandoning his job for the afternoon to join her on a spur-of-the-moment road trip into the unknown. Lulu (Griffith) is pure id incarnate, a seemingly supernatural being who exudes sexy style from every pore and who is apparently able to avoid trouble by the simple expedient of never allowing it to cross her mind. There's an absolutely brilliant scene early that sums up the start of their relationship. Lulu asks Charlie (Daniels) if he's going to come with her, turns on her heel and marches across a busy New York street without the slightest glance to the left or right. Charlie follows, desperate not to let her get away, and almost gets creamed by two or three vehicles which come careening through the intersection about one half-second after Lulu has passed. Like just about everything in this movie, it's smart, subtle (not overplayed) and absolutely hilarious (Daniels' double-takes as he sees the cars coming at him are priceless). Soon they're on a journey through middle America (New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Virginia) and as always, Demme's eye for the telling details of blue collar American life is absolutely unequalled. Like Scorcese portraying New York Italian-Americans, Demme gives us a run-down, faded exurban America that rings true down to the tiniest details. In addition, his use of music is absolutely perfect. Again, comparisons to Scorcese may be apt, but I think Demme uses music to even better effect. Think of the scene in Silence of the Lambs where Catherine is singing along with Tom Petty in her car. In this movie as well, the music is just exactly perfect, with dub reggae, indie rock and 60s punk coming together with John Cale and Laurie Anderson's original music for the film.Finally, I would be remiss if I did not point out that this film contains, IMO, two of the absolute funniest scenes ever put to celluloid; the first handcuff scene and the scene where Charlie buys a new outfit at the gas station (Charlie. Attempt to be cool.). But to simply say this is a funny movie is to sell it very, very short. In the hands of lesser talents, this probably would have remained a fish-out-of-water romantic comedy, but as Charlie and Lulu discover more about each others' past, Demme (as he does in Silence of the Lambs as well) subtly exposes issues of class and gender that are indelibly stamped on their relationship (and their lives). Yet not once once does he become preachy, sappy or dryly academic. This funny little offbeat comedy manages to say more the most important issues in our lives than a hundred self-conciously important serious Hollywood dramas, and manages to do it with such a light touch that probably won't even realize at first that you aren't just watching a funny little offbeat comedy.

Jeff Daniels portrays a stereotypical uptight Wall Street yuppie who acts out his rebellious fantasies by occasionally leaving restaurants without paying his check. Melanie Griffith is the downtown urban hipster woman who catches him in the act and tempts him into a real act of (equally senseless) rebellion, abandoning his job for the afternoon to join her on a spur-of-the-moment road trip into the unknown. Lulu (Griffith) is pure id incarnate, a seemingly supernatural being who exudes sexy style from every pore and who is apparently able to avoid trouble by the simple expedient of never allowing it to cross her mind. There's an absolutely brilliant scene early that sums up the start of their relationship. Lulu asks Charlie (Daniels) if he's going to come with her, turns on her heel and marches across a busy New York street without the slightest glance to the left or right. Charlie follows, desperate not to let her get away, and almost gets creamed by two or three vehicles which come careening through the intersection about one half-second after Lulu has passed. Like just about everything in this movie, it's smart, subtle (not overplayed) and absolutely hilarious (Daniels' double-takes as he sees the cars coming at him are priceless). Soon they're on a journey through middle America (New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Virginia) and as always, Demme's eye for the telling details of blue collar American life is absolutely unequalled. Like Scorcese portraying New York Italian-Americans, Demme gives us a run-down, faded exurban America that rings true down to the tiniest details. In addition, his use of music is absolutely perfect. Again, comparisons to Scorcese may be apt, but I think Demme uses music to even better effect. Think of the scene in Silence of the Lambs where Catherine is singing along with Tom Petty in her car. In this movie as well, the music is just exactly perfect, with dub reggae, indie rock and 60s punk coming together with John Cale and Laurie Anderson's original music for the film.Finally, I would be remiss if I did not point out that this film contains, IMO, two of the absolute funniest scenes ever put to celluloid; the first handcuff scene and the scene where Charlie buys a new outfit at the gas station (Charlie. Attempt to be cool.). But to simply say this is a funny movie is to sell it very, very short. In the hands of lesser talents, this probably would have remained a fish-out-of-water romantic comedy, but as Charlie and Lulu discover more about each others' past, Demme (as he does in Silence of the Lambs as well) subtly exposes issues of class and gender that are indelibly stamped on their relationship (and their lives). Yet not once once does he become preachy, sappy or dryly academic. This funny little offbeat comedy manages to say more the most important issues in our lives than a hundred self-conciously important serious Hollywood dramas, and manages to do it with such a light touch that probably won't even realize at first that you aren't just watching a funny little offbeat comedy.

This film does that in many ways. If you remember seeing an old David Lean movie called Brief Encounter, Intimacy may remind you of it only this film takes you much farther into the actual affair than many films dare to go. Whoever trains British actors gets my undying admiration. Mark Rylance gives an understated performance that simply thrills a person with its reality. Anyone who knows the work of Mike Leigh (Secrets and Lies) will want to see this movie. All of the actors give performances that rate highly with me. Imagine a scene where actors have to pretend that they are in an actors training session and they are supposedly doing improvisation. How would you script this? Could you script this? It's marvelous to watch.As the plot advances the dialogue is spare. A sign of great film making in my view. The camera work and editing provide the clues as to what is transpiring. At the heart of the movie, the tables turn in an unexpected way that leaves the viewer breathless. You almost have to stop watching to consider all of the implications of what has happened.Sure there are some strange inexplicable events, but that's life isn't it? So based on boldness, superb acting, amazing realization or direction this film will shock and satisfy, puzzle and pique your interest. One of the greats to emerge from the new realist school of European film making. Along with Romance and Blais Moi. Finally film making that looks at sexuality in an adult way and doesn't get coy when the actual act of sex is depicted. I delight in seeing films that are brave enough to illuminate the act of sex, after all it's what most humans are designed to do.

In retrospect I think that what most unnerved me was the sex role reversal element with the woman as predator rather than the convention of the man stalking and terrorizing the woman. All right, it has been done several times since, most notoriously in Fatal Attraction, but never with quite the same chilling effect as Jessica Walter's Evelyn in Misty. Now, many viewings later (It is one of those films that I love introducing friends to) the shock horror element, but not the terrifying unease of Jessica Walter's performance, has diminished and I see the film for what it really is, possibly the saddest depiction of a deranged state of mind exacerbated by unrequited love that cinema has given us - more tragic even than Truffaut's Adele H. Clint Eastwood has made some pretty good films in his time (I particularly like Pale Rider), but nothing quite equals this first masterpiece. It is a model of perfect pacing and timing; one that should be made compulsory viewing for all aspiring directors of suspense films, so that disasters such as Arlington Road that knock you on the head in reel one, can be avoided. Hitchcock demonstrated time and again that the really successful suspense film must take the form of a gradual crescendo, a fact clearly understood by Clint Eastwood. Indeed here he takes the process a stage further by giving us the interesting variation of a double crescendo with an interlude of unbelievable calm and relief sandwiched in the middle. I notice that the insertion of the lyrical sequence accompanied by First time ever I saw your face followed by the jazz festival has often been criticised for holding up the action, but surely those who think this are missing the point. To my mind it is just about the cleverest use of lulling the audience into a sense of false security (The monster must certainly be dead or, in this case, put out of harm's way) that the cinema has given us. It has the effect of making the second crescendo even more harrowing than the first. Clint has got the timing and structure of his great tragi-horror film exactly right.
