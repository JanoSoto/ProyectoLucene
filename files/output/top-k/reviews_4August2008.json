[{"date":"4 August 2008","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Starship Troopers, coming out two years before Wing Commander, replayed the WW2-propaganda film for satirical purposes. For all its gore and splashy special effects, at least it could claim it had a brain behind it somewhere. Wing Commander is much more straightforward. The evil Clumsy Cat-Aliens are attacking humanity, and it's up to Freddie Prinze Jr and his buddy Matthew Lillard to kill 'em all.Nevermind that the premise and background are thinner than paper. Do we know anything about the two races? No. The humans are just as vague as the Clumsy Cat-Aliens. Do we know why they're fighting? Of course not. We're just meant to assume that one side is evil, I guess.The point is the action, right? So long as stuff blows up at a satisfying rate, everything will be okay. That's the trouble the space-battle scenes are filmed in the dark with all the excitement of a video game (one played by someone else, that is). The bad guys pose no threat whatsoever, and when our hero finally fights them face to face, they promptly fall over as if they can't be bothered to put up a fight.Everything about this movie is stupid and generic and kind of boring. Costumes appear to have been borrowed from the Warsaw Pact, and the little space-fighters look suspiciously like vintage MiGs; the larger spaceships all look more or less the same, like hybrids of aircraft carriers and submarines, barely visible in the depths of space. In the movie's favor, it's got a great cast of European character actors Tcheky Karyo, David Warner, Jurgen Prochnow, and David Suchet. Maybe if they'd dumped the American leads they could have had a B-movie that wasn't so offensively dumb.

Nicholas Meyer, the writer\/director, is competent in an efficient, workmanlike way, and the movie zips along at a fine pace but with barely an original bone in its body.Khan, from the original series episode Space Seed, hijacks a starship with a plan to kill Captain Kirk. Kirk's having a midlife crisis, and has just met the son he never knew he had, who happens to be a scientist who's created a MacGuffin with limitless destructive potential. Kirk is full of angst, and talks a lot with Spock and McCoy, so some of the feel of the classic series is preserved. Everyone quotes liberally from Shakespeare and Moby Dick, with a little Dickens thrown in, to the point that they might have written the entire script by perusing Cliff's Notes and skimming Horatio Hornblower novels.The redesigned Starfleet uniforms signal a change in the way our heroes will be portrayed in future films. They are no longer exploring representatives of an idealistic utopia, but servants of a futuristic military. The space battles that make up the bulk of the film's action are dazzling, in a modest way, but the main characters spend most of their time on the bridges of their respective ships, pressing buttons and talking. You can plainly see that the budget was not very impressive.This movie might be noteworthy in that it's the only Star Trek film to have no aliens in it, besides Spock. It's got action and excitement, and those timeless themes of loyalty and honor or something equally wishy-washy, but there's nothing in here to really make you think, which is what the TV show always tried to do, even when it was being silly.EDIT I recently watched The Wrath of Khan again, and found that I was wrong on a couple points. First, the pacing is leaden. Only James Horner's music creates any sense of excitement while the story slogs along. Second, there is hardly any chemistry among the three leads. In fact, Kirk and Spock only share two or three important scenes, and are separated for the rest of the film. Spock's famous final sacrifice is rendered nearly meaningless. Most of the actors appear lifeless; Shatner's performance in particular is shockingly wooden, and he mumbles his dialog. Was anyone really asking for a subdued, realistic performance from William Shatner?
