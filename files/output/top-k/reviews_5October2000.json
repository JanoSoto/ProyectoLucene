Not only in  the visual sense,  but in storytelling, the way society is, and much more.  And, Keanu Reeves is almost good here.Reeves playes 2 people in one- Thomas A. Anderson, a regular Joe who is just working it today's society.  The other is Neo, a comuter hacker who has broken every single known computer hacking law.  But, he soon meets Morpheus, played with great mysticism and wiseness by Laurence Fishburne, who brings Neo down the rabbit hole to tell him the truth about the world; we are living in a world called the Matrix, which uses out brain energy to trun us into batteries.  Unbelieveable to be sure, but it is incredibly original story wise, as it sprawls into something every average movie goer can appreciate- hard boiled, visually and bloody packed action, gore and violence.The best part though is that this film breaks many boundaries in technology and (with it's 4 Oscars for editing, sound, sound editing and visual effects) and deserves every bit of credit it gets.  True, some might find the plot confusing and boring and true it isn't for all tastes.  But if you can like the story and the action, you've got the key to a fantastic picture, otherwise it is another action flick (great action never-the-less). Kudos to everyone who worked on the film, making one of the best films of the year, decade and of sci-fi film history.

The gift he has to see art everywhere, the way the world expands in his eyes and brings great inspiration that's only for him to understand. And then to see this child of beauty being confronted with the cruel and shallow world of the art elite and everything that's comes with such a meeting...it's depressing. People don't appreciate the beauty, only the what they're expected to like the curse of all times - not being able to see beyond the majority of opinions.David Bowie is absolutely brilliant as Andy Warhol, and Jeffrey Wright is taking on the role as Basquiat with sparkling eyes!This movie gives joy and beauty, but also reminds us of the shallowness of most people and the decay of the world.
