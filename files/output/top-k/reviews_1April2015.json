Henry V was a powerful adaptation but i would say that this full, four-hour adaptation of Hamlet is even better. Everything is done with such great eloquence.Hamlet of course is an adaptation of William Shakespeare's play about Hamlet, the prince of Denmark (played by Branagh) who believes that his uncle Claudius (Derek Jacobi) murdered his father to become king. Hamlet starts to make plots to get his guilty uncle to confess his foul act while Claudius starts to plot the murder of Hamlet.The thing that i loved about the fact that this film was the full version of Hamlet is that this way all the nuances and social statements weren't left on the cutting room floor. In for example Olivier's version of the story all this is left off and the film feels like a lamer, less powerful version of the story no matter how beautiful that film looks. The dialog is of course Shakespeare's original words and those words feel as powerful and meaningful as ever.And maybe a part of that power in the words is because the lines are performed so well. Kenneth Branagh plays the role of Hamlet with such power and calmness. He reads the lines so beautifully. Derek Jacobi's Claudius feels like an actual character in stead of being a two- dimensional character like in some of the other film adaptations (another advantage of the full four-hour version). Other good performances include ones by Julie Christie, a young Kate Winslet, Richard Briers and Michael Maloney.As good as Branagh's performances is i think the way he directs the film is even more amazing. For a four-hour adaptation of a 16th century play the film is incredibly cinematic. Every single scene is directed with such intensity and power. His attention to detail with the technical aspects of the film is phenomenal. The production design is beautiful as are the costumes. The score is really good and is another one of things i liked about the film.One might ask after all this praise why am i not giving it a 10\/10. I'm not sure. Pretty much all the aspects of the film work really well. But i just wasn't perhaps blown away by it enough to give it the highest rating. But it still is a phenomenal film that i recommend very much. It's especially a must see for Shakespeare fans.

Telling people to watch the film at every chance I get. My actions may seem like I am overselling the film, but I truly think my insistence's are justified, Alien truly is a horror and science fiction masterpiece. Playing on many primal fears, Alien is able effectively horrify its audience, even without fully showing its titular monster. Alien is set in the distant future where flying in a spaceship is the same as driving a truck - something people just did and not something that was seen as an amazing feat. We learn this through the characters interactions and their bickering with each other, not by obvious exposition that plagues Hollywood films these days. Our cast here is stellar. Sigourney Weaver gives a great performance as our heroin, Ripley, showing a stern woman who is fully capable of taking control of a situation and taking care of herself. This was something that went against the status quo, something that was seen as innovation, it's now seen as the norm and we have Weaver to thank for it. Iam Holm also gives a great performance as the ships science officer who is hiding an alterer motive. His performance is intensely creepy, sometimes taking the spotlight away from the titular creature. The cast all work really well with each other, bickering and complaining amongst themselves, it creates a level of intimacy with the characters as they sound like regular human beings in irregular circumstances. The films atmosphere is its greatest strength. The industrial and claustrophobic design of the ship really helps enhance the feeling of isolation. The ship looks unfriendly, with the upper decks coated in a distinctive beige colour that lacks any sort of life and the lower decks that are uncomfortably small and dark - with black being the primary colour. The Alien planet is an amazing creation, the uncanny geography and distant vistas that go against any known geography on Earth create an uncanny feeling that really enhances the idea that they are on a distant planetoid that is certainly not something we're use to. The derelict ship that our characters visit is covered in sexual imagery that attacks the view in places that they were not expecting. The Alien itself is one of the best movie monsters that has ever been devised. It is a creature that fits its name perfectly, working both as a noun and an adjective. The creature was devised by the late H.R Giger, his work is truly unsettling, attacking the view in a way they were not expecting sexually. The Alien has no clear sexuality, but its phallic all over, so is it male, female or asexual? When it attacks its victims it appears to be raping them rather than killing them. The creature truly is alien, with its long tail, exoskeleton like appearance and inner mouth, it's like nothing you could ever conjure up. All of this help increase the level of dread you feel when the creature is on screen. It is truly terrifying. Alien is impeccable. It is one of the best horror movies ever made. It has great acting, chilling visuals and a terrifying creature that will remain in your mind for years. You could say that I admire its purity.

In order to earn that rating film must affect me personally, have interesting characters, great plot and all the things that make a great movie. Shawshank is one of those films and it's not just one of my favorite films of all time, it might just be my favorite out of all movies i have watched (currently)So what's the plot? Banker named Andy Dufresne (played by Tim Robbins)is sent to the shawshank Penitentiary for murdering his wife. There he makes some new friends, but also some enemies along the way. It's pretty simple at first, but after a while some gangs in the prison starts to harass Andy, Conspiracies, Corruption and many other things that i can't spoil in this review.Tim Robbins does a great job playing Andy, and Morgan Freemans role playing his fellow cellmate Ellis Red Redding is also one of the best of his career. Supporting cast also deserves a mention. None of the performances were really bad, so you can really immerse yourself into the film. You will not see any actors just reading their lines, You see only the characters in this prison. You simply just get lost into this film right from the beginning.Next i want to talk about cinematography.Almost every shot is constructed beautifully and and kept steady. Frank Darabount really nailed the prison setting and how it should be filmed. It's not anything mindblowing but it does the job especially well. Last thing i want to mention is why i enjoy this movie so much? Well all the things i mentioned earlier sure do help but one thing that makes this movie a classic for me, is the ending It's simply perfection. It explains how strong a friendship can be, How you can make your dreams come true even if the circumstances are horrible. It's one of my favorite endings to any story i have ever seen or read.So what more can i say? Go see this movie and get sucked into it just like i did, and always will.So yeah there's my first review. Hope it was OK. If not, well there's always a second chance, just like in this film.

Frank Darabount really nailed the prison setting and how it should be filmed. It's not anything mindblowing but it does the job especially well. Last thing i want to mention is why i enjoy this movie so much? Well all the things i mentioned earlier sure do help but one thing that makes this movie a classic for me, is the ending It's simply perfection. It explains how strong a friendship can be, How you can make your dreams come true even if the circumstances are horrible. It's one of my favorite endings to any story i have ever seen or read.So what more can i say? Go see this movie and get sucked into it just like i did, and always will.So yeah there's my first review. Hope it was OK. If not, well there's always a second chance, just like in this film. ","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"1 April 2015","score":"","review":" First off this is my first review, so i'm sorry if this review will not be that good or interesting but hey, let's give it a shot.There's only 23 films that i've given a 10\/10. In order to earn that rating film must affect me personally, have interesting characters, great plot and all the things that make a great movie. Shawshank is one of those films and it's not just one of my favorite films of all time, it might just be my favorite out of all movies i have watched (currently)So what's the plot? Banker named Andy Dufresne (played by Tim Robbins)is sent to the shawshank Penitentiary for murdering his wife. There he makes some new friends, but also some enemies along the way. It's pretty simple at first, but after a while some gangs in the prison starts to harass Andy, Conspiracies, Corruption and many other things that i can't spoil in this review.Tim Robbins does a great job playing Andy, and Morgan Freemans role playing his fellow cellmate Ellis Red Redding is also one of the best of his career. Supporting cast also deserves a mention. None of the performances were really bad, so you can really immerse yourself into the film. You will not see any actors just reading their lines, You see only the characters in this prison. You simply just get lost into this film right from the beginning.Next i want to talk about cinematography.Almost every shot is constructed beautifully and and kept steady.

It's more than a movie, it's an experience. How is that possible? Unfortunately it's impossible to describe to you why that is unless you know the premise, so here goes Our protagonist (Guy Pearce) is a man named Leonard. He is on a seemingly impossible quest for revenge after his wife's rape and murder by an unidentified assailant. The attack left him with a head injury that now prevents him from forming new memories. He knows who he is, he remembers everything up to the moment where he suffered the injury but if he has a conversation that lasts too long, he won't remember how it started. Now, using clues from the night, limited information from the police file that's gone cold, Polaroid photographs, hand-written notes to himself and help from people he has met, Leonard is slowly tracking down the man responsible.Now that you have the premise of the film, there is another vital piece of information that you must know in order to understand what this movie is like. The movie is told in reverse, with the scene that would normally be at the very end of this story being shown at the beginning, and so on. This means that just like the protagonist, you don't know what causes actions or how Leonard go to a spot as its happening. This is where the brilliance of the film comes in. Just like Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, where the drug trip the characters go on, and the experience of watching the movie feel like the same, the condition that Leonard suffers and the experience you will get from watching the movie are the same. It's hard to wrap your brain around this, but even if you're dubious about it working (trust me, it works incredibly well), have you ever seen a movie that tries to pull a trick like this? It's a breath of fresh air.What I love about this movie is that it's not just a gimmicky story; it would still be just as interesting to watch if it was told in the normal order. It's a story about revenge like no other because it exposes the biggest flaw about going on a quest to get even in a way that no other movie about the subject can. If you were out on the path of vengeance, you might get satisfaction from killing the person that murdered your wife, but that isn't going to get her back. The purpose of revenge then, is revenge itself. You seek retribution in order to give yourself the satisfaction that you have done something. But what happens when you don't even have that? What happens when you find the guy and you take gleeful pleasure in making him suffer so intensely that he prays for death, but once the deed is done you can't even remember it happening? I'm a huge fan of films about payback because there's something primal about them that is satisfying, but they also lend themselves very well to complicated ideas and paradoxes. This is one of the smartest and most original stories of revenge that I've seen.There's even more going on with this movie because it plays wonderfully with the condition that Leonard suffers from (the technical term is anterograde amnesia). As the story unfolds you see that many people sympathize with the man's condition, while others use it to their advantage and ultimately it becomes impossible to know who he can really trust. The further you get into the movie, the more twisted it gets and everything that you think you know gets turned upside down. Once again, it makes you as disoriented as the character in the movie and that's a wonderful, original and confusing feeling. All of a sudden, sequences of mundane exposition become huge plot twists! I found Memento to be an extremely satisfying experience. It's so twisty, so intelligently written, so well acted and so well directed that it's the kind of movie that you can never forget once you've seen. I absolutely loved it and I'm very curious to see how it plays out a second time around, or if there is a way to view it in the correct order with some special edition blu-ray or DVD out there. I can't say enough good things about it. If you're interested in movies even a little bit, you should treat yourself by experiencing Memento.

But I feel it's a bit of a letdown. Audrey Hepburn, as usual, is luminous (and she is, as usual, paired off with a suitor far too old for her). But part of the problem is what the story does with her character. She pines away for Holden, and then goes away to cooking school in Paris. Why does she go? Did she want to go? Unknown. While away, she writes her father a letter saying she is over Holden. But then, when she returns, she (in a rather absurd coincidence) runs into him at the train station. The two connect. So she wasn't over him after all? Or was she over him, but then fell back in love when she saw him? What was her plan if she hadn't coincidentally run into him? Who knows? Later, Bogart and Holden sort out which of them gets to have her, which is rather sexist and also robs her of her agency. (Surely a charming girl like that must have other options besides a buffoon and an old man.) Holden hasn't been given much of a character to play. He's all charm and nothing else. The script never rounds him out with grace notes that might have helped us to understand why he lives such a vacuous life. As an actor, Holden has consistently shown an ability to locate the darkness buried inside his characters, but he never seems to tap into that quality here. (It might have been interesting if Hepburn, during the course of dating Holden finally realized what a shallow loser he is and dumped him. And then maybe Holden, in turn is forced to reexamine his life. But the story never explores that darker, more interesting possibility. Instead, Hepburn is a pawn in the men's games.) As for Bogart, he was, of course, one of our great stars and did amazing work in dramas and crime stories. But in a light romantic comedy like this, he's very much out of his element, like Holden is. (Bogart took the role after Cary Grant turned it down.) Bogart manages to capture the cold sourness of his character just fine, but he never locates the man's gradual transformation into a guy in love. He never seems interested in Hepburn at all, which is oddly something of an accomplishment, given how beautiful Hepburn is. The problem is further exacerbated by the fact that Bogart is too old, unattractive and emotionally cold for Hepburn to ever give him the time of day. When these two would-be lovers are reunited at the very end of the film, they hug rather than kiss. It's as if the filmmakers are acknowledging the absurdity of that these two might actually be right for each other.

You know he's a blue-collar worker because he always wears an unbuttoned blue shirt stained with mechanic's grease, and he hangs out in a classic dive bar in Queens with his burly, beer-drinking buddies. He wishes that his son, played by Charlie Sheen, would have become this or that instead of a stockbroker. Can you guess which two professions he envisions for his son? If you guessed lawyer and doctor, congratulations, you've seen a movie and you know the clichés. And if you've paid attention, you know why that cliché is all wrong for Martin Sheen's character. He is created in the classic image of the hard-working, straight- shooting, lunch-pail-carrying union man, so what use does he have for a lawyer son any more or less than a stockbroker son? All a doctor son would do is tell him to put out the cigarettes he smokes as a kind of socio-political statement. If it's just upward mobility he's after for his son (it's not, as he makes clear), then high- powered trader ought to be good enough. His lawyer or doctor speech is not just a hack line of dialogue, it's the wrong hack dialogue in the wrong hack character's mouth.Between that early scene and the end, Wall Street and the people in it change very little. The mode of expression is obvious and labored and faux-intellectual for the duration. The movie is Oliver Stone's spoonful of supposed truth about the rotten core of American capitalism, force-fed to audiences without any adulteration of wit or charm. A lot of critics and audiences lapped it up in 1987. They and the Oscar voters were Father Stone's choir, happy to give a pass to his pulpit-pounding so long as he was sticking it to the Reaganites and Thatcherites. Michael Douglas's Gordon Gecko and his British counterpart played by Terrence Stamp are the strawmen who stand in for the latter groups. Conveniently, they know they are bad guys. They don't have the pesky tendency of real-world people to believe that they're basically decent. When Gecko says Greed is good, one of many soundbytes the script tries on and one of few that fits, he is trying to persuade a roomfull of stockholders that capitalism is the engine of progress and a force for good in the world. If he believed that, as many people do, he'd have been a much more interesting figure. The characters played by the Sheens would have to engage him more thoughtfully in order to make a case to the contrary. Happily for them, no such effort is required by them, Stone, or the audience, because Gecko doesn't really believe what he says; he knows he's hurting others, and he doesn't care. The lifestyle he has, the language he uses, and the amorality he cultivates all exist in real life, and maybe sociopaths like him do exist in greater proportions on Wall Street than on Main Street. But characters as black and white as Douglas and Martin Sheen's are the exception. Wall Street is a fantasy movie, the world as Stone's conspiratorial mind imagines it to be. It is neither politically nor emotionally intelligent.It is, however, cheesy, and this goes a long way toward making the film watchable. Charlie Sheen's Bud breaking down by a hospital bed is as old a chestnut as the scene where his meat-and-potatoes father looks askance at a hoity-toity piece of sushi and the one where Gecko quotes Sun-tzu. These moments are so earnest and yet so cartoonish that they create some unintentional levity by virtue of their familiarity.There is some good stagecraft and visual communication in Wall Street. Many shots are stuffed front to back with people, and this brings the always-inhuman spectacle of the trading floor into the usually quieter spaces of white-collar offices and the executive conference rooms. All levels of the Wall Street world are thus implicated in the madness. At the back and along the edges of many of these crowded rooms, Stone carefully places real workers doing hands-on jobs window-washers, janitors, many of them minorities and women. This is as subtle as the film gets, and it is more effective in its quiet way than Gecko's villainy or Martin Sheen's self- righteousness.

","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"1 April 2015","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Martin Sheen plays a blue-collar worker. You know he's a blue-collar worker because he always wears an unbuttoned blue shirt stained with mechanic's grease, and he hangs out in a classic dive bar in Queens with his burly, beer-drinking buddies. He wishes that his son, played by Charlie Sheen, would have become this or that instead of a stockbroker. Can you guess which two professions he envisions for his son? If you guessed lawyer and doctor, congratulations, you've seen a movie and you know the clichés. And if you've paid attention, you know why that cliché is all wrong for Martin Sheen's character. He is created in the classic image of the hard-working, straight- shooting, lunch-pail-carrying union man, so what use does he have for a lawyer son any more or less than a stockbroker son? All a doctor son would do is tell him to put out the cigarettes he smokes as a kind of socio-political statement. If it's just upward mobility he's after for his son (it's not, as he makes clear), then high- powered trader ought to be good enough. His lawyer or doctor speech is not just a hack line of dialogue, it's the wrong hack dialogue in the wrong hack character's mouth.Between that early scene and the end, Wall Street and the people in it change very little. The mode of expression is obvious and labored and faux-intellectual for the duration. The movie is Oliver Stone's spoonful of supposed truth about the rotten core of American capitalism, force-fed to audiences without any adulteration of wit or charm. A lot of critics and audiences lapped it up in 1987. They and the Oscar voters were Father Stone's choir, happy to give a pass to his pulpit-pounding so long as he was sticking it to the Reaganites and Thatcherites. Michael Douglas's Gordon Gecko and his British counterpart played by Terrence Stamp are the strawmen who stand in for the latter groups. Conveniently, they know they are bad guys. They don't have the pesky tendency of real-world people to believe that they're basically decent. When Gecko says Greed is good, one of many soundbytes the script tries on and one of few that fits, he is trying to persuade a roomfull of stockholders that capitalism is the engine of progress and a force for good in the world. If he believed that, as many people do, he'd have been a much more interesting figure. The characters played by the Sheens would have to engage him more thoughtfully in order to make a case to the contrary. Happily for them, no such effort is required by them, Stone, or the audience, because Gecko doesn't really believe what he says; he knows he's hurting others, and he doesn't care. The lifestyle he has, the language he uses, and the amorality he cultivates all exist in real life, and maybe sociopaths like him do exist in greater proportions on Wall Street than on Main Street. But characters as black and white as Douglas and Martin Sheen's are the exception. Wall Street is a fantasy movie, the world as Stone's conspiratorial mind imagines it to be.

What I love about this movie most of all is the truly original premise. This world where monsters are real and they power up their cities by bottling up the screams of frightened children is wonderfully inventive and it lends itself to some incredibly creative character designs. It's all so well animated that you might just forget that what you're seeing on the screen isn't live action footage (particularly the scenes involving snow). Another particularly strong element in my opinion is the voice casting. The voices match the monsters so well that the models must have been modified or done after the recordings were done to match the voices, mannerisms and dialogue so well. Either that or we've got some incredibly dedicated, intelligent and talented individuals with an incredible amount of forethought behind the scenes at Pixar.It's sweet and funny, with just that right sprinkle of heart and at times very thrilling too. One chase scene involving doors (you know what I mean if you've seen the movie) in particular always gets me excited and I never get tired of gushing over how wonderfully original it is. It's filled with characters and moments with Mike (Billy Crystal), Sully (John Goodman) and Boo (Mary Gibbs) that your heart would have to be made of stone not to enjoy it. Every time I watch this movie I catch some new gag in the background or some new detail I've overlooked in the past, meaning it's got great re-watch value as well. You'll always find something interesting to look at (though you'll have to be familiar with the story to be able to pull your eyes away from the main action).This is the kind of movie that you call a family film because anyone can watch Monsters, Inc. and instantly fall in love with it. When you watch it with other people, it makes you feel like your enjoyment of the movie is bringing you all closer together.

When we were children, this movie would have been a good scary movie, but as adults with children of our own now, it reminds us that our family bonds can be fragile and strong at the same time. It shows us that love for your family can be your greatest strength and that we shouldn't let anything, natural or supernatural, get in the way of that.

I understand that werewolves badly maul and kill people, but this was the first were I saw it actually eat people. I wonder if David belched after turning human again ?! And the decomposing undead victims was a different twist. They kept there original personalities unlike traditional zombies that just limped along and moan and grunt. That left one for the imagination!

I know it's got some major issues but it was my first classic Bond movie. I still remember getting it on VHS when GOLDENEYE made me curious to see earlier 007 films and, as a younger kid, I was drawn in by the promise of James Bond in space. MOONRAKER is Roger Moore's fourth film in the franchise and, after putting together the excellent, THE SPY WHO LOVED ME, I guess everyone decided they could slack off a bit for the next installment. Released in 1979 on the heels of the release of the original STAR WARS, the producers decided to add some science fiction into the mix to capitalize on the popularity. Keep in mind I use the phrase science fiction here as loosely as possible. The movie starts with the mid-air hijacking of a space shuttle off the back of a jumbo jet transporting it across the Atlantic, setting the film's events into action. James Bond is assigned to investigate the shuttle's disappearance, starting his investigation at the facility where it was constructed. The millionaire industrialist who's company created the Moonraker shuttle, Hugo Drax (Michael Lonsdale), doesn't seem all that concerned with the missing spacecraft and immediately goes about instructing his personal henchmen to kill the British agent. So, right off the bat, we've established the villain and eliminated any mystery there. With the aid of the supposed NASA scientist Holly Goodhead (Lois Chiles), Bond will follow the clues to Venice and Rio de Janeiro as he pieces together Drax's evil scheme.What I find most interesting about MOONRAKER is how my taste has changed in the years since I first saw it. The movie is sort of split into two major parts the secret agent action here on Earth and the third act set aboard Drax's private orbital space station. As a kid, I loved the space action and found myself bored with everything that led up to it. Now it's the opposite. I actually really enjoy the first two acts of the movie and dread everything after the shuttles launch. I'll admit the movie has serious tonal issues. It can't decide if it wants to be a more serious spy\/action movie or a parody of itself. I'm not going to lie and say I don't like the goofy bits though. The movie brings back Jaws (Richard Kiel) after his popular introduction in THE SPY WHO LOVED ME. He's not as much the stone cold killer this time around. I guess the moment in the last film where he dropped a sandstone block on his foot got a lot of laughs because he spends most of MOONRAKER finding himself in zany predicaments (i.e. going over a waterfall or free-falling with a busted parachute) and mugging for the camera. I can't hate it though. Jaws has been one of my favorite characters since I first saw this movie years ago and, while I love the stone cold killer version better, I'm fine with the punch line version too.The real issue with MOONRAKER is how fast it hits the brakes once we leave Earth for the big final act. You know we're in for trouble when the initial journey to the space station feels like forever (think the initial Enterprise reveal in STAR TREK THE MOTION PICTURE but not quite as excessive). The filmmakers were proud of their initiative in sending Bond to space and their special effects so they make sure we have plenty of time to soak it in. Whenever there's no gravity, everyone starts moving incredibly slow because&#x85;I dunno&#x85;outer space. And if you don't get enough time to appreciate the outer space effects on the trip up, don't worry. There's a long, dull space laser battle to really drive the point home. I'll give them credit; the effects aren't that bad. I actually like the look of it all. I just wish the filmmakers weren't so proud as to forego keeping the action interesting. Space marines floating around, exchanging laser fire (seriously, lasers) with Drax's personal army, and spinning off into the distance whenever they're hit. We're treated to a handful of those shots as men are zapped into oblivion. With my newer perspective, I can see it all for the pandering that it is, trying to rake in a buck after STAR WARS, but I still find it fun. Roger Moore is a good blend of serious and goofy. Jaws is still awesome. And Michael Lonsdale is great as Drax, growling his lines ominously and only ever raising his voice once over the course of the film. He's a soft-mannered, well-spoken sort of megalomaniac. I could see him cracking my top-ten list of Bond villains.MOONRAKER is a weird little anomaly in my 007 fandom. It's obviously not a great film but it's far from the worst of the franchise. It's got some heavy nostalgia behind it for me and, even setting that aside, there's enough here for me to enjoy. The casual fan? I couldn't tell you how well it'd sit with them but I know I'll be busting it out once a year to revisit Bond's adventure into orbit.

Great performances all around. The respect with which they all treated one another was beautiful, despite the captives\/captors dynamic.
