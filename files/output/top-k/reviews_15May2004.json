First, Election is definitely a black comedy, a pretty damn successful one at that. It's funny. Furthermore, it's original.

But it's politics taken to the extreme because the main players are exaggerations of what we can imagine to be real-life people with strange tendencies. Reese Witherspoon's Tracy Flick is a highly-obsessive over-achiever with neurotic attention to detail and terrifying determination towards good ambitions. She wants to win the election and is confident she will. Then we have Jim McAllister, performed so well by Matthew Broderick you'll be surprised, a popular teacher who a) does not like Tracy and b) is about to face a severe mid-life crisis because of meddling with her. Add to that a pair of siblings, Paul and Tammy Metzler, each of whom also run for election (Paul because Mr. McAllister wants Tracy to have an opponent, and Tammy to get back at Paul), the latter of which is not a lesbian, but loves people who just happen to all be girls.And they all clash, in strange, unknowing, darkly comic ways. The truly funny thing about it is the amount of accident and fate involved in the entire process. A theme runs through the story of the importance morals and ethics (a comic, underdeveloped theme of course, but a theme nonetheless) which, due to chance in large part, are shunned. The only person who, in fact, remains moral and ethical is Paul who is so nice and so incredibly dumb he could not hurt a fly because it would not occur to him.The real war, however, is between McAllister and Flick, not Flick and her opponents in the race. They are archenemies and they fight dirty. All this stems from McAllister's dislike of Flick and Flick's undying resolve. And, like I mentioned earlier, it's all really truly funny.But is the film more than just a sharp comedy? Election does in some sense satirize high-school elections and politics in general. It suggests the complete destruction of the democratic process which the election contestants and judges constantly invoke. At one point, in a scene bathed in irony, pertaining to the counting of ballots, it reveals the meaninglessness of the entire election. I'm inclined to believe, however, that Election is not a great satire of politics or the electoral process, and if it seeks to be one, it gets highly distracted. That's not a bad thing though since Election's swerving from the political theme is done to shed light on the strange, imaginative characters about whom, in the end, Election is actually about. And the film is fair to these curiously annoying people; it doesn't judge them. It presents them in their twisted weirdness, with their obsessions and their ambitions and their conflicts. While a hope of understanding between McAllisters and Flicks is childish and futile, watching them misunderstand each other is rarely this amusing.

In this movie, all the characters do weird things without logical reasons, yet one can't see they're out of character because their character is never developed - it's all a dream; I'm not going to accept someone's dreams as character development.If Diane's dream can't tell anything about herself, it can't about Rita either. Dreams are illogical things, they're not ruled by a cause-effect situation or an inversion of reality - yet, Lynch, who should know better, believes they do - because Betty is a failed actress in the real world, she must be an accomplished one in her dream, understand it? Rita wants nothing with her in the real world, so she has to be dependent on Diane inside the dream... cause-effect without stopping... how I'd wish dreams were this easy to explain!They're not, although in this movie it is - I can't understand where the hype about this movie being confusing and hard to understand came from anyway? It's a very simple story about a failed actress who gets a hitman to kill her lesbian ex-lover, then has a 2-hour long redemption dream where she saves her lover and they love each other. What is so hard to understand, then?If it were a story set in the real world, it could actually be a good noir\/mystery movie, but serious changes would have to be made on the characters.

And from those 30 minutes, I was never lead to believe a character like Diane could actually cold-heartedly have her lover killed, then feel guilt, followed by a dream where she 'fixes things' and finally suicide. I'm just not convinced she'd experience all this - if the movie had spent more time developing her, perhaps I would, but this half-hour was just a bunch of quick clips of scenes moving too fast from place to place without giving time to know the characters.Ultimately, Mulholland Dr. is a disappointing movie, and I hate to say this, a bad movie. Hundreds of good ideas floating about, but that's just it - they float without ever being linked to characters, who should always carry the ideas in a work of fiction. Like Jorge Luís Borges, Lynch doesn't write realistic characters - Lost Highway was actually worst, though - with their own distinctive voices, he instead just talks through them whatever he wants about his weird ideas.Stop buying the hype, Lynch, and go back to doing emotional, intelligent work like The Elephant Man, Blue Velvet or Twin Peaks, or just tackle someone else's screenplays once in a while, like you did with 'The Straight Story' ","genre":null},{"date":"15 May 2004","score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":"  SPOILERS AHEADSo, whereas the traditional movie has two whole hours to develop characters into realistic independent creatures with their own voices, Mulholland Dr. in its 150 minutes only has 30 minutes worth of character development, because the first two hours are a dream sequence, and the last half-hour is the real world.Of course, in the first two hours the characters are really just an extension of a David Lynch who bought into his own hype about his weirdness - a pity because Twin Peaks and Blue Velvet showed a director\/screenwriter with a great ear for realistic dialogue and an incredible understanding of human psychology.

The whole mass manufacturing of the 'ooze' to brainwash the parents of Angelgrove, seems to be like some grotesque fast food enterprise. Is this the intelligent, political message we've all been trying to find in the movie? Well, hardly, as the whole Power Rangers franchise, in its day, was one of the most wealthiest and popular businesses, and it dominated the television and toy industries. I remember I was seven years of age when the movie was released. However loathsome you may think of it now, when the movie was launched, prepubescents everywhere were celebrating. It was what the countless hordes of kiddies were waiting for. The irony is, is that I was among those ranks of enthusiasts, who believed that the Power Rangers vehicle was deified or something. But the real irony is that we were all brainwashed, as if we had guzzled our own healthy dosage of ooze. Oh, how naïve.The script, is of course, utterly abysmal. The movie's entire dialogue seems to be a disgusting volley of clichès. Their purpose was probably to add a touch of humour, but their delivery were so unforgivably corny they were all swallowed by the audience (apart from those too young to know) like lead bullets. They are so dull I can't remember any. There is some unintentional laughs when Tommy stops the monorail from plummeting from the tracks 'just in time'. Everyone knows that they'll be practically teetering on the edge before they are dramatically saved. I remember I used to vehemently abhor Bulk and Skull, but now I actually feel sorry for them. They are a duet of desperate low-lives who just seem to get in the way, but we sort of sympathise with them, because they are just so inordinately hopeless. It is true there is nothing beyond the hammy kung-pow karate theme, but the people who saw it in 1995 (exempting the submitting mothers who promised to send their kids to the cinema as long as they'd just shut up) weren't expecting a Sartre-style treatise on existentialism, but to consume more vacuous action from the Power Rangers. Naturally, its more of the same its basically an episode agonisingly stretched to feature-length. To my juvenile anger, Lord Zed played a very small role in the movie's plot. Instead you have eccentric despot Ivan Ooze who had been 'woken' (as most movie horrors are resurrected) who does have a sort of shine about him, but he's still terribly drab in parts. You can imagine the parents raising a smile to a couple of his sardonic comments.To be fair, the acting isn't totally irritating. The Power Rangers were marginally better than they were on the small screen, but for anyone watching the movie today, there is little to get excited about. They are predictable and so therefore of little interest. What I still find interesting today is the costumes, such as the dinosaur fighter statues that emerge from the rocks. They look like overgrown Henson puppets. And Ooze's cloak looks like its made from purple tin foil.The effects were advanced for their day, I'll give them that. The whole plot is like one behemoth of a computer game, so without special effects, the movie would have been further flawed. But once again, they have painfully dated, and the scene where Ivan Ooze extends and morphs into one of his giant metal insects is hysterical.Still, its the classic schmultzy 'and they all lived happily ever after' movie, and as long as you ignore the lukewarm script and just prepare yourself for a film that doesn't delve beneath the surface, you'll find it's an alright movie to watch, maybe once, with the children or the family. Its no Citizen Kane, but then what in today's film industry really is?And no one can deny that the Power Rangers were something almost everybody raved over in the early nineties they were at their popularity zenith when this film was released in 1995. It WAS a big part of many children's lives, who wished something exciting as this would happen in real life.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Family"},{"date":"15 May 2004","score":"8 out of 15 people found the following review useful","review":"  One thing I've noticed when watching this movie again (caught it languishing on the sleepy annals of daytime TV) is that there is an overriding theme of anti-globalization. The whole mass manufacturing of the 'ooze' to brainwash the parents of Angelgrove, seems to be like some grotesque fast food enterprise. Is this the intelligent, political message we've all been trying to find in the movie? Well, hardly, as the whole Power Rangers franchise, in its day, was one of the most wealthiest and popular businesses, and it dominated the television and toy industries. I remember I was seven years of age when the movie was released. However loathsome you may think of it now, when the movie was launched, prepubescents everywhere were celebrating. It was what the countless hordes of kiddies were waiting for. The irony is, is that I was among those ranks of enthusiasts, who believed that the Power Rangers vehicle was deified or something. But the real irony is that we were all brainwashed, as if we had guzzled our own healthy dosage of ooze. Oh, how naïve.The script, is of course, utterly abysmal. The movie's entire dialogue seems to be a disgusting volley of clichès. Their purpose was probably to add a touch of humour, but their delivery were so unforgivably corny they were all swallowed by the audience (apart from those too young to know) like lead bullets. They are so dull I can't remember any. There is some unintentional laughs when Tommy stops the monorail from plummeting from the tracks 'just in time'. Everyone knows that they'll be practically teetering on the edge before they are dramatically saved. I remember I used to vehemently abhor Bulk and Skull, but now I actually feel sorry for them. They are a duet of desperate low-lives who just seem to get in the way, but we sort of sympathise with them, because they are just so inordinately hopeless. It is true there is nothing beyond the hammy kung-pow karate theme, but the people who saw it in 1995 (exempting the submitting mothers who promised to send their kids to the cinema as long as they'd just shut up) weren't expecting a Sartre-style treatise on existentialism, but to consume more vacuous action from the Power Rangers. Naturally, its more of the same its basically an episode agonisingly stretched to feature-length. To my juvenile anger, Lord Zed played a very small role in the movie's plot. Instead you have eccentric despot Ivan Ooze who had been 'woken' (as most movie horrors are resurrected) who does have a sort of shine about him, but he's still terribly drab in parts. You can imagine the parents raising a smile to a couple of his sardonic comments.To be fair, the acting isn't totally irritating. The Power Rangers were marginally better than they were on the small screen, but for anyone watching the movie today, there is little to get excited about. They are predictable and so therefore of little interest. What I still find interesting today is the costumes, such as the dinosaur fighter statues that emerge from the rocks. They look like overgrown Henson puppets. And Ooze's cloak looks like its made from purple tin foil.The effects were advanced for their day, I'll give them that. The whole plot is like one behemoth of a computer game, so without special effects, the movie would have been further flawed. But once again, they have painfully dated, and the scene where Ivan Ooze extends and morphs into one of his giant metal insects is hysterical.Still, its the classic schmultzy 'and they all lived happily ever after' movie, and as long as you ignore the lukewarm script and just prepare yourself for a film that doesn't delve beneath the surface, you'll find it's an alright movie to watch, maybe once, with the children or the family. Its no Citizen Kane, but then what in today's film industry really is?And no one can deny that the Power Rangers were something almost everybody raved over in the early nineties they were at their popularity zenith when this film was released in 1995. It WAS a big part of many children's lives, who wished something exciting as this would happen in real life. And lets face it, for many children the watchful eye of the Power Rangers would be something comforting, a protection against the bleakness of the world. Shame it's just so awful today.

The underlying idea is also simple. Men are great, but our one problem is our uncontrollable attraction to beautiful women. Damn them and their curves! They're like our kryptonite. Why one of the first things our evil pulchritudinous plotters say about Flint is that they've been studying him, and he has three 'weaknesses', meaning the three women who live with him. So what better as our only hope against those women we can't ignore than the man whom women find irresistible, Flint! Good thing there are no homosexuals of either kind in this universe. Although, the awesome Lee J. Cobb (See his work in _Twelve Angry Men_ and remember that he originated the role of Willy Lowman in _Death of a Salesman_ on Broadway.) does a baffling turn as the bumbling, emasculated head of intelligence. Though far from effeminate, he does end up the movie in a dress.So much does the movie fear women that its women are all eroticized beyond any reality pale, china doll skin; heavy make up; over styled hair that has been mostly bleached and blonded within an inch of its life. I swear, at times Jean Hale and her clones (not actually clones in the film) either look like dolls or animated corpses. It's too much! I'll say one thing; standards of beauty then were more forgiving in at least one way in that these women looked like they were at least allowed sit down to a decent meal every once in a while.So live it up! It's 1967 and all we have to fear is nuclear devastation and an attack force of gorgeous, Caucasian women in bikinis and sailor suits. Kick back and remind yourself why there was a cultural revolution in the late 60s and early 70s. Oh yeah, Coburn's Flint is great &#133; but he runs like a girl!

Everyone seems to either love or hate this film and few people seem to be inbetween.  I can see why, since the material in and of itself is the sort of thing that would draw a lot of conflicting opinions, and the style of the film is odd, which will enrage some and attract others.  Personally, I found this controversy of opinions to be compelling, and I rented the film.  Partially because of the comments on this board, but mostly because I simply adored Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, which is the latest and only other film to be written by the incredible Charlie Kaufman and Michel Gondry.Here's my opinion, perhaps the only non-polarized one on the board  I felt that it was good, but not great.  Charlie Kaufman has certainly written far better scripts in his career, and Michel Gondry did a far better job on Eternal Sunshine as well as his music video work.  The tone of the film was goofy, which made sense artistically, but wasn't really goofy enough to grab my attention.  On top of that, the film does break tone from time to time, getting a little too over the top (although, it is over the top from the beginning, which works, but it seems to exceed its own limits at times).  Overall, it's some pretty solid writing and directing, but what's missing is anything to make this film really stick out as special.However, what I find particularly impressive about this film is that, when watching this AND Eternal Sunshine, you can really see the incredible range that Michel Gondry has (as does Kaufman, but I was already aware of that from his other works).  Eternal Sunshine and Human Nature are two of very few feature films that Gondry has directed, and they are incredibly different films.  Eternal Sunshine maintains a very realistic tone throughout the film, while Human Nature's tone is more cartoonish (which is ironic since Eternal Sunshine contains more fantastic elements).  Eternal Sunshine has a somewhat gritty feel to it (or as much of one as a comedy can have) and, visually, focuses on a specific color scheme and low-key lighting.  Human Nature is far more evenly lit and doesn't seem to have much of a specific color scheme.  Yet, in both films, he manages to execute his decisions well (though far better in Eternal Sunshine).Human Nature is not the greatest film in the world, but it is worth it to see the work of a great and talented director.

I have seen it maybe half a dozen times on the big and small screens, read reviews and analyses of it, as well as essays about it in a couple of Hitchcock biographies. I recognize just how it fits into Hitchcock's filmography and how it details his notorious obsessions. It is an important film as far as the study of Hitchcock is concerned. But, in the end, VERTIGO is just not a very good movie. I don't see why it is considered to be one of the greatest films of all time; indeed, I wouldn't even place it in Hitchcock's top twenty. Instead of appreciating it more each time I view it, I find myself resenting the way it distracts from Hitchcock's better efforts.The premise -- basically a variation of Frankenstein by way of a dark and brooding My Fair Lady -- involves a man's attempt to reshape a woman into the image of a woman he thought he loved and lost, not realizing they are the same woman. The concept is intriguing in theory, but largely unbelievable in execution. The film is told in two halves, the first being a detective story. It involves the type of ludicrously contrived murder scheme that only works in old self-mocking whodunits ('You see,' explained Nick to Nora, in between sips of his martini, 'Gavin had to use Scottie as his patsy, because a man who was not deathly afraid of heights might have climbed to the top of the bell tower and discovered....') You get the idea. Almost like a trial run for the far superior PSYCHO, Hitchcock concocts a convoluted thriller storyline which ultimately only serves as a set up for the psychological drama in the second half. This may be the only aspect of the film that shows Hitchcock's genius using a far-fetched mystery narrative as a way of luring the viewer into the murkier melodrama that is the real center of the story. But, it seems Hitchcock was so fascinated in elements of the latter part of the story that he wasn't concerned with the plot holes and dubious logic that make the first half largely unbelievable. And, unfortunately, part two is hopelessly entangled in the clumsy web spun in part one.It is part two of the story that also fascinates the film's admirers (who tend to ignore or forgive the sloppy set up of part one). Having established that James Stewart as Scottie, has fallen in love with Kim Novak's Madeline, only to see her apparently commit suicide, the film introduces Judy, also Novak, who is a dead ringer for Madeline. On meeting Judy, one would think that a trained detective like Scottie would immediately be suspicious and begin to investigate her past, instead he starts playing Henry Higgins and begins training Judy to again look and act like Madeline. Judy, who should realize that Scottie can implicate her in a murder, plays along, presumably because she has fallen madly in love with Scottie. But basically, no one does anything logical in this film, everybody being hopeless enslaved by the rather silly plot, rather than by obsessive love or psychological turmoil. The film just doesn't stand up to close scrutiny, either dramatically or psychologically.Okay, films, especially Hitchcock's, are less about plot than style. But even so, the film is substandard, especially for a Hitchcock film. There are a few clever shots and striking images, but that is overshadowed by slow pacing, a very hokey dream sequence and stilted dialogue. And there are some odd choices involving the use of color that prove particularly annoying. At first, I thought the muddy, muted look of the film was the result of badly aged prints, but seeing the restored version proves this not to be the case. And for some reason, Jimmy Stewart's face seems bright orange in every print of the film I have seen. The look of the film is so annoying, that the last time I watched it, I turned the color off on my TV set. The film actually plays better in black and white, reflecting its pulp film noir elements.It seems that the reason the film's reputation has skyrocketed over the years has less to do with Hitchcock's skill at making it, than that VERTIGO represents a convenient checklist of all his phobias, fetishes and obsessive visions. Those who have laboriously defended the film seem to skim over the gaping holes in its logic, dwelling on the film's paper-thin psychology The film's protagonist Scottie representing Hitchcock and his not-so healthy desire to control and abuse women of a certain type. Okay, maybe that is so. But a psychological profile is not necessarily the same as a work of art -- or even passable entertainment. Hitchcock may -- or may not -- be revealing his psyche more in this film than in any other he ever made, which makes it Jim-dandy for discussion of his entire career, but that doesn't mean VERTIGO stands up on its own.Rather than representing the epitome of what the name Hitchcock stands for, VERTIGO should represent some sort of embarrassment. The story is poorly plotted and poorly told. Novak and Barabra Bel Geddes give solid performances, but Stewart is just terrible in the central role; it just may be is worst screen performance. And Hitchcock's stylistic touches seem self-consciously obvious, detracting form the drama rather than underscoring it. But, as a dress rehearsal for what he would soon accomplish, VERTIGO works decently enough. The red herring first act, the unexpected death of the leading lady, the psychologically scarred protagonist with necrophilic leanings (played by an actor with an established boy-next-door image), the denial of a one woman's death by creating the illusion she exists in another person's body; these are all elements that would rise again in PSYCHO, Hitchcock's true masterpiece.

I have seen it maybe half a dozen times on the big and small screens, read reviews and analyses of it, as well as essays about it in a couple of Hitchcock biographies. I recognize just how it fits into Hitchcock's filmography and how it details his notorious obsessions. It is an important film as far as the study of Hitchcock is concerned. But, in the end, VERTIGO is just not a very good movie. I don't see why it is considered to be one of the greatest films of all time; indeed, I wouldn't even place it in Hitchcock's top twenty. Instead of appreciating it more each time I view it, I find myself resenting the way it distracts from Hitchcock's better efforts.The premise -- basically a variation of Frankenstein by way of a dark and brooding My Fair Lady -- involves a man's attempt to reshape a woman into the image of a woman he thought he loved and lost, not realizing they are the same woman. The concept is intriguing in theory, but largely unbelievable in execution. The film is told in two halves, the first being a detective story. It involves the type of ludicrously contrived murder scheme that only works in old self-mocking whodunits ('You see,' explained Nick to Nora, in between sips of his martini, 'Gavin had to use Scottie as his patsy, because a man who was not deathly afraid of heights might have climbed to the top of the bell tower and discovered....')

The things you own end up owning you. This could be true in a materialized environment where everyone is selling something for a living and at the same time doing some purchase and being a consumer himself, where the desire to have more would easily grow out of control and deluge a soul from inside. However, it ought not to be understood that it has to be the case for all who have obtained some kind of property within the easy reach of their pockets, and that one would be better off without having anything in his possession. A few nice pieces of furniture from IKEA would not make one feel being possessed (or enslaved), but a craving for everything clever probably would. So the issue may not be a simple matter of to have or not to have, but rather a delicate business of finding a balance between what one can comfortably earn and what one really needs for survival. The dividing line might get so fine that one more step could make difference.   It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything. A very inspiring theory for those who know what they are up to when freed(or,to be on the safe side, BEFORE taking the plunge). Indeed, men can give up things they own and endure a much-reduced living condition if only they know there are better things for them to fight for. Burning a condo full of nice stuff might sound exciting. But if you don't belong to that clever bunch, don't do it. How much can you know about yourself if you've never been in a fight? This is perhaps the most interesting saying in the whole Fight Club thing. Yet different interpretation of it could result in very different scenarios. Taking it literally means you've got to exchange blows with someone and see if you can conquer him (or, if not, what will be left of you after that), so as to give yourself an assessment. However, this concept can be as glorious as it is perilous. It would be fine for you, if you happened to be a powerfully built man apt at one-two stuff. But what if you were not the type, but the smirking guy paired up with you was, and you knew, by a mere glance of his mean face, that, three minutes into it, you would surely be punched into a nasty squash of pulp? How are you going to make a fair evaluation of your precious self in a situation like that, eh? However, taking the saying beyond its surface and assuming it implying the meaning that one could fight with whatever one is strong on, the whole theory would be of great significance to many.

But what if you were not the type, but the smirking guy paired up with you was, and you knew, by a mere glance of his mean face, that, three minutes into it, you would surely be punched into a nasty squash of pulp? How are you going to make a fair evaluation of your precious self in a situation like that, eh? However, taking the saying beyond its surface and assuming it implying the meaning that one could fight with whatever one is strong on, the whole theory would be of great significance to many. Indeed, with that idea in place, nearly every sort of being can fight. For instance, if you had a head much more decent than the trunk beneath, you could go fight with your brainpower¡ª outwitting a mind could be as thrill (if not thriller) as thumping a body into submission. And even if you were a God-forgotten child, having a head and a form with qualities way below the average, and a down-and-out life with no one there to care for you but an old lame dog, you could still fight the world with all the defiance and burden-free calmness that only you could possibly have, walking on the street with your head held high and your dog at your heels, daring anyone who has everything to take anything with them when the time comes. In the end we are all equal, aren't we?
