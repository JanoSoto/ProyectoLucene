The real meaning is there but you have to dig to find it. There is still something on the surface but it hides the real material, like skin covering the real meat and skeleton.Now, I've been doing some reading about the cult and the Illumanti and all that and Kubrick's death and how it all relates. Let me first say that I completely agree that Eyes Wide Shut isn't REALLY about sexual exploration and the relationship of a couple who are having marriage issues. These are themes that have been explored way before EWS came out, and many critics jumped on the movie for not being original like most Kubrick films and beating a dead horse that had already been cinematically explored. But I think Kubrick was more intelligent than that. However, many conspiracy theorists jump on the fact that EWS is really all about cults (certainly ironic considering Cruise and Kidman's scientology ties) and how evil they are, and especially about how the Illumanti control the world and we are blind to it, with some even saying that EWS is Kubrick's warning of a new dark age to come. And blah blah blah.Me, I see the film as actually a deep complex study on our fascination with cults and conspiracy theories as a whole, and of the unknown. It is inherint that there is something creepy about what we don't understand. The mysterious is never boring. I think a lot of people attribute stuff (say, 9\/11 for example) to crazy theories because a) it makes everything seem more interesting and b) because it means responsibility is never in your own hands. This works with EWS very well I think. Firstly, Cruise and Kidman are portrayed as the 'vanilla American' couple getting bored with life and each other. Again, many conspiracy theories are made by people bored with their own lives that want excitement in believing that there is a BIGGER PICTURE out there and that they are one of the lucky few to really see what is happening, while everyone else is sheep. This also fits in with Cruise's intent interest to go to the party he is told about that he knows is VERY exclusive. It is exciting and different, and it is something most people don't know about.But then, secondly, is the fact that Cruise doesn't have to really take responsibility for his actions. He had drawn away from his wife, and was willing to cheat on her, but then the cult threatens his life and suddenly the issue of infidelity is MINOR when compared to the grand tragedy and mystery that he came upon. This can very much be symbolic of why such organizations have their powerfullness and mystery trumped up, and why conspiracy theories are so popular. It takes away the importance of our own actions in the big scheme of things. They can be the invisible scape goat we point to when we make our own mistakes. It's a way to gauge your own sins against far greater sins and to find absolution in this fact.Even the title, EYES WIDE SHUT, fits in this paradox. People make themselves believe they have a greater view on life than all others while really they are the most blind themselves. The ones who think they get it and that everyone else is sheep are only fooling their own hearts.I see the sun worshipping cult as a tool to further these themes and the journey the main character takes through both reality and fantasy, ego and anonymity. The real trick to it, and the trick to most of Kubrick's film, is that they are never about what you think they are about. If the film says one thing, it really means another.To me a big theme of Eyes Wide Shut is responsibility, and the importance of our own actions as OUR actions (and the contrast between your actions being part of a larger sum and belonging to you on an individual level.) The blurred line between the real and the unreal, between boring old life and the fantasy of our dreams, is also very important as well for this film, especially in the fact that sometimes we want - and need - that line to be blurred. To discover more about ourselves and who we really are, and also to discover more about life and the experiences and sensations it can offer, we can find ourselves searching out dangerous roads. These confusing paths can lead many places. They can lead to a reality where up is down, where the blind see more than anyone else, and where those who appear enlightened actually are the most sightless of all. So to speak, this is a journey where you can take each step with your eyes wide shut.

But unfortunately, as is often the case of sequels, they seldom live up to their predecessors. Ghostbusters II is lacking in the energy and drive that propelled the original, something that reflected the box-office takings. Part 2 seriously underperformed compared to Part 1. They just couldn't repeat the same magic twice.All the cast are back, and Ivan Reitman is again directing, but there's nothing terribly original about this film. Its just a retread of the first, with only a few novelties thrown in for good measure.There is a bit of poignancy in the early scenes. Time has not been kind to the Ghostbusters. Because there is no Ghostbusters anymore. When they saved the world from the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man (the only one who doesn't return for Part 2), they also put themselves out of business.Venkman (Bill Murray) now hosts a psychic cable show for fraudsters.

And Egon (Harold Ramis) has gone back to standard scientific research.But trouble is brewing on the horizon. And again its Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) who brings the team into action. Dana now works at an art gallery, and one of the paintings she's restoring is possessed by the spirit of an evil dictator, Vigo. Vigo wants to return to the physical world, but he needs to possess a child to do it. And he's chosen Dana's baby boy, Oscar.Add to that a river of slime running beneath the streets of New York that feeds off the bad vibes of the people above, and we have another apocalypse on our hands.Its a bit hard to pinpoint why Ghostbusters II disappoints as much as it does. There's just no life to it. Its all perfectly watchable but it never raises anything more than chuckles while Part 1 induced aching sides. The cast are all present and correct, but even they go through the motions.You can tell Bill Murray is coasting his way through the part. Something that's not a pretty sight to see. When Murray is engaged and attuned to material, he can turn in a fantastic performance. But when the material doesn't interest him, his laid-back nonchalance turns sluggish. Something that seriously undermines the film as a whole. Films like the horrendous Scrooged and the utterly tedious The Life Aquatic.Ernie Hudson is once again moved to the sidelines, but at least Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis are given a bit more to do this time. The one thing in the film's favour. The only complaint I had with Ghostbusters was that all the best lines were given to Murray. And Aykroyd and Ramis were a little upstaged. But they're given quite a few witty one-liners here. And Egon is especially funny, who gets some cracking wry observationsWell Peter was borderline for a while...then he crossed the border.Its nice to see Sigourney Weaver back, but she isn't given much of a chance to shine. She's just reduced to playing the cuddly working mum. And the film could have done without Rick Moranis. He overplays the Woody Allen shtick to the point I wanted to strangle him.And we get a really grating performance from Peter MacNicol as a foreign curator who works at the gallery and gets possessed by Vigo. Shame because MacNicol is usually capable of great things. Just watch any episode of Ally McBeal. But here he's wasted in a part that's beneath him. And that scene where he runs through the night-sky with a pram is just plain silly. The film's best scene is when the Ghostbusters end up in court for blacking out the whole city through illegal drilling (which is a bit preposterous). Its the one scene in the whole film where it manages to recapture the spirit of the original. Everyone is given plenty to do. Quips rebound back and forth like a tennis match. An hilarious turn from Harris Yulin as a fire and brimstone judge. And it all culminates in a dazzling showcase of special effects work when two ghosts from the judge's past return to seek revenge. Classic!But elsewhere the film is thoroughly routine. The effects work is just as good as you'd expect. But the big climax with the Statue of Liberty walking through the streets of Manhattan, an obvious attempt to rehash Mr Stay Puft is not nearly as thrilling as it should have been. And I never once believed it was a statue come to life. Just somebody dressed up to look like it.Ghostbusters II has its moments, but it moves in fits and starts. The two story lines of the painting and the slime never converge. Something it tries to achieve but never quite manages. And Oscar is a McGuffin purely designed to move the plot along. Nice gag at the end with the new and improved painting, but overall Ivan Reitman fails to deliver. Something that would become a depressing habit with him.

When Murray is engaged and attuned to material, he can turn in a fantastic performance. But when the material doesn't interest him, his laid-back nonchalance turns sluggish. Something that seriously undermines the film as a whole. Films like the horrendous Scrooged and the utterly tedious The Life Aquatic.Ernie Hudson is once again moved to the sidelines, but at least Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis are given a bit more to do this time. The one thing in the film's favour. The only complaint I had with Ghostbusters was that all the best lines were given to Murray. And Aykroyd and Ramis were a little upstaged. But they're given quite a few witty one-liners here. And Egon is especially funny, who gets some cracking wry observationsWell Peter was borderline for a while...then he crossed the border.Its nice to see Sigourney Weaver back, but she isn't given much of a chance to shine. She's just reduced to playing the cuddly working mum. And the film could have done without Rick Moranis. He overplays the Woody Allen shtick to the point I wanted to strangle him.And we get a really grating performance from Peter MacNicol as a foreign curator who works at the gallery and gets possessed by Vigo. Shame because MacNicol is usually capable of great things. Just watch any episode of Ally McBeal. But here he's wasted in a part that's beneath him. And that scene where he runs through the night-sky with a pram is just plain silly. The film's best scene is when the Ghostbusters end up in court for blacking out the whole city through illegal drilling (which is a bit preposterous). Its the one scene in the whole film where it manages to recapture the spirit of the original. Everyone is given plenty to do. Quips rebound back and forth like a tennis match. An hilarious turn from Harris Yulin as a fire and brimstone judge. And it all culminates in a dazzling showcase of special effects work when two ghosts from the judge's past return to seek revenge. Classic!But elsewhere the film is thoroughly routine. The effects work is just as good as you'd expect. But the big climax with the Statue of Liberty walking through the streets of Manhattan, an obvious attempt to rehash Mr Stay Puft is not nearly as thrilling as it should have been. And I never once believed it was a statue come to life. Just somebody dressed up to look like it.Ghostbusters II has its moments, but it moves in fits and starts. The two story lines of the painting and the slime never converge. Something it tries to achieve but never quite manages. And Oscar is a McGuffin purely designed to move the plot along. Nice gag at the end with the new and improved painting, but overall Ivan Reitman fails to deliver. Something that would become a depressing habit with him.

As everyone knows, it is all about the shocking, twisted, and unbeatable ending which could possibly be the most successful slasher film ending ever (Psycho beats it but that may not technically be a slasher). Then again, everyone has heard about the ending; if you know it you will still be shocked (I knew the ending the first time I saw it and it still had the power to shock me and stick with me) but if you don't know it than you will probably be blown out of the water.The story of Sleepaway Camp is pretty much routine for the most part; campers who do mean things to other campers are murdered in grisly ways by an maniac. The main characters include Ricky, Angela, Paul, and Judy. For his young age, Jonathan Tiersten plays Ricky to a perfect pitch, and he provides as a tough, likable hero (or villain?) to the story. Ricky's shy and awkward sister Angela, whose father died years beforehand in a boating accident, steals the show for more than one reason. Not only does she literally 'make the movie' but Felissa Rose plays her with such grace that you can't help but feel bad for her while also questioning if she is the maniac. Chrisopher Collett plays Paul, Angela's love interest who attempts to bring her out from her shy state, while Karen Fields plays Judy, the nemesis of all three other characters. Fields does her job as playing someone you can't help but hate.The direction of Sleepaway Camp is a little rough at times but still manages to pull of that authentic look. The musical score is good and keeps you tuned it, but the true essence of the film lies in the time period which is was made in. The outfits worn by the characters are at times scarier than the theme of the film, but you can't help but love them. Men wearing half-shirts, the short shorts... they're all there.Sleepaway Camp is available in a boxed set along with its two sequels, and it is also available in a single keepcase DVD. On the DVD is a commentary with the director, Felissa Rose, and others while a trailer is also included. Rumors have it that when the currently shelved sequel Return to Sleepaway Camp is released there may just be a special edition of the original shocker available.

I wasn't necessarily disappointed by this film, but felt it could have been done differently.I think one of the difficulties with a film of this nature is that you are building up to an ending which everyone is aware of and there are only a few ways you can build up the background to the climax. In a film such as 'Wyatt Earp' for example, everyone knows the gunfight at the OK Corrall is coming, so the film builds up the background for you as best it can pretty much chronologically.The angle with this film is that the background is set with a series of flashbacks, which don't entirely work and become slightly tedious. It would have been easier to watch them as a chronological story, but you feel sympathy with Walter Hill for wanting to mix it up a little.Ultimately, it comes out as a slightly rushed mish-mash. The flashbacks are not long enough to really set the scene for you, whereas the early part of the film which goes from 1867 through to 1875 is a bit garbled and doesn't make complete sense until later. There are also very brief references to Hickock's time in the army, which could and probably should have been expanded on. I didn't really understand this as the film is only an hour and a half long and could have done with another half hour.With regard to the actual content, Bridges is superb and imposing as Hickcok, and I personally liked the choice of Arquette as Jack McCall (considering I'm not a fan of his generally). Much of it is fiction or exaggerated fact, but that is par for the course with Westerns and if we're honest with ourselves that type of romanticism is what draws us to the genre.All this notwithstanding, it is an easy watch and by no means as demanding as 'Wyatt Earp' or even 'Young Guns'. The scenes where Bridges is in full flow are quite excellent and recall all the great Western leads. I would very much recommend this film to all fans of Hickock or Westerns generally, as it certainly has its entertaining moments, even if the presentation is not all it could be.

Timothy Hutton delivers one of the best performances I've ever seen as Conrad Jarrett and it is a shame that he never really took off in Hollywood. His scene after he discovers that his friend from the hospital (played by the underrated Dinah Manoff)commits suicide and he finally opens up to Dr. Berger is the moment that made this movie and made him deserve that Oscar.Dr. Berger was Judd Hirsch, who also received a deserving nomination for BSA but his performance was more subtle while Hutton's was a mixture of that and bang-pow. Hirsch's character seems to be low on words at times but he gets his point across and he is a very wise person. If there was ever a time that a Supporting duo could share an Oscar for a film....this is Definitely it!! Now Robert DeNiro fully deserved his Oscar for RB but I feel that if there were no DeNiro that year then Donald Sutherland should have won for giving a very loving and passionate performance as the caring dad Calvin who doesn't really understand everything that is happening. The only thing that prevented from a win was the fact that HE WASN'T EVEN NOMINATED!! This was a very horrible snub and I personally felt this was his best performance and it deserved a nomination and in any other year a win.Lastly, everyone loves Mary Tyler Moore and thinks she is one of our most lovable TV icons....well in this movie you can see she can act like a really snobby b**ch!! Moore's performance as Beth is amazing because it is a VERY against type role for her and she pulls it off EXTREMELY well.

Moore and Sissy Spacek (Who eventually won without any complaints) were worthy of a win and these two women will forever split into thinking who deserved it more.Ordinary People is a great movie that makes you think and I will also say it is not the movie to watch if you want to be cheered up because it is a very emotional film.
