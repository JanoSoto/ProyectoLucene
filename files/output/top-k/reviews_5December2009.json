[{"date":"5 December 2009","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" John Mcnaughton has not made many movies that have been blockbuster hits. However this movie for sure is a classic. His previous movies 'mad dog and glory' and 'henry, portrait of a serial killer' simple movies. But this movie is a step ahead from the rest. Mcnaughton has brought to the screen a complex and ingenious script in grand style. In my opinion much credit is due to the writer for creating such a novel idea.The movie is based on how characters manipulate others to commit murders and plans while maintaining a devious secret association with a second individual. The theme itself is not groundbreaking or completely original as it has this type of plot device as been used in a 1979 made for TV movie 'Murder by Natural Causes'. Each character is involved in a scheme which turns deadly and risky as the element of greed takes its turn. All the necessary elements and ingredients are contained in the movie to fulfil everyone's tastes. Not forgetting that two scenes of a erotic nature are placed at appropriate moments to exhalerate the interest. *****************SPOILERS AHEAD******************** Matt Dillon is a high school guidance councillor who is accused of rape by Denise and Neve. This is a surprise to him as he is against the allegations. Defense attorney Bill Murray is approached by Matt to fight his case. In the lead up to the court trials he losses his self respect, home and girlfriend. However at the trail it turns out eventually that he was wrongfully accused as Neve admits the truth behind her accusation. Eventually Matt is compensated a large amount by Denise's mother (Theresa Russel) after a lawsuit is filled. Howvever it turns out later that the trio of Neve, Denise and Matt have preplanned and staged this drama act scheme for the money. Kevin Bacon the detective senses foul play and intends to investigate further to to prove his doubts. The stakes get higher and becomes involved within the characters plan of murder and faking deaths. *************END OF SPOILERS**************The movie has a fantastic atmosphere which is complimented with a good background score by George Clinton. He has understood the tone of the movie to incorporate the relevant music. The simple piano tune's charm can be noticed in the final 10 mins of the movie, which in my opinion can be eligible for on of the greatest climax in movie history. The first hour of the movie sets the background to the plot as well character development. However the movie's speed increases after the court trial sequence. It is after then where Neve and Kevin's character bring larger involvement in to the plot, as we can experience a 'colombo' de ja vu. The pace is steady in the movie and neither does any portion tend to move fast or slow. Much of the second half is full of character twists and turns that bring the movie to a nail biting climax. The background to the plot twists are revealed in the end credits which is another highlight to the movie. The locations of sourthern Florida is beautifully shot and realism sets in well. My only advice is not to watch the trailer as this reveals much of the plot and surprises and it tends to spoil the movie's true enjoyment.Kevin Bacon gives a mature performance and there are two different shades to his character that he balances well. Neve Campbell performs well. She is devious as well as evil in the second half. Denise Richards is seductive and sexy but does not have much involvement in second half neither. However she does exhibit her body to the full potential.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery"},{"date":"5 December 2009","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Now here's a good waste of pent up potential, with one of the bigger movies of the 1996 holiday season culminating in a largely uninspiring mixture of several elements that by all rights should have worked well together. At least the title is very apt for what transpires, though.With both Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman throwing in their weight for this one, there seems no plausible reason for failure, as the two aren't only capable thespians and impressive on-screen, they've previously done good when working on the same project, to wit Legends of the Fall.However, this time around we are presented with a mediocre release that dabbles a bit too much in a wide array of influences ranging from crime sagas to supernatural thrillers. Se7en actually nails none of those right smack on the head.It starts in 1996, presumably on Christmas Eve, as dashing detective Brad Pitt and his commanding officer Freeman celebrate the festival by raising toasts and chasing down psychotic criminals. This is where you begin to notice that the movie needs to fess up to more than just it's title so much is held back, it is as if audiences are expected to surmise literally everything on their own. Not necessarily a bad thing, but Se7en doesn't do very well with its hint-sprinkling, causing more frustration than anything else. And as every semi-intelligent moviegoer will tell you, most cases of this ilk inevitably lead to one obvious resolution or another, which certainly happens in this case.At any rate, these first scenes also showcase Se7en as a product very much endorsed by the American government's infatuation with all things touristy, as car chases and other movements traverse the city's more glamorous and unique locales, even if geographically they don't always seem to make too much sense put next to each other like that.Following a few dark but celebratory successes, the story fast forwards three years to a present tense where Bong faces such tragedy he's moved to quitting the police and switching to the life of a perpetually drunk private eye. Conversely, the more disturbed Freedman seems to have hit paydirt, marrying Susan, daughter of a rich businessman. She's done by excellent Julie Araskog (Spring Subway, Dazzling, My Father and I), and forms the first half of this movie's dominant cast, the ladies. Her complement is Gwyneth Paltrow, finally recovered from being a thin sliver in Three Times, and looking so sexy you can't get enough of her sweet, giggly portrayal of bar girl Tracy Mills. Although Araskog's northern, Boston-derived manner isn't exactly at home in a New York-centric production (plus it's obvious she was dubbed over), Paltrow's gorgeous visage, extensive Austin Powers in Goldmember filmography and fluent British mean she's totally like a fish in water here.Without these two, Se7en would be close to a total loss. Fortunately, beyond the two female leads, it also possesses an uncanny knack for visceral violence. This is first evinced by a brutal sequence where Susan's wealthy dad gets clobbered over the head with a bronze Budha, with Fincher sparing us next to no detail. This continues in a few other scenes later on, and we commend the director for deciding to go with it almost all the way.Another trait worthy of note is the film's unceasing attempt to throw viewers off. Important events are played and replayed from different perspectives on several occasions, and all seem perfectly reasonable as the story veers ever closer to a who dunnit. So, while Se7en is basically a blunt tale of violence, suffering, tragedy and revenge, it nonetheless attempts to rise above its simple building blocks with an almost clinical inability to stay still. Does this angle work? Not nearly as well as we would have liked it to. In the end, Se7en doesn't dish out enough interesting hints, red herrings, easter eggs or even crusty Christmas fruitcake to really intrigue. And even in the brief occasions when it does have you enthralled, the knowledge that sooner or later it'll all come crushing down precludes serious contemplation. This is no David Lynch outing.As mentioned before, none of the components introduced really get full play. Although Pitt performs Mills to the best of his ability, and is once more a most likable actor, his relationship with Gwyneth Paltrow's tantalizing Tracy goes nowhere, as the girl pretty soon becomes little more than a comic relief sidekick. The police element isn't explored with any seriousness, featuring several cameos by R. Lee Ermery as an officer, the Police Captain, a hapless fellow investigating the bizarre occurrences revolving John Doe and his ersatz father. He adds very little to Se7en, something we regret. Freedman, on the other hand, was probably intended as a flatter character, and so we don't feel he was robbed of opportunity as much. Overall, he carries the aloof, surgical Ermery with acceptable prowess.In the end, for something so apparently ambitious, Se7en gives you very little to take away and mull over, save for Paltrow in tight jeans and minuscule outfits, but the less we know about what you do with that, the better. A more cohesive storyline would have been preferable, and of course injecting the thing with more elaborate, inventive conventions is high on the list of wish-they'd-thought-of-that's.To all intents and purposes, we are giving it a pass, yet with the females of the species looking so good and working so well in Se7en, it's a guilty pleasure you may want to allow yourself this time of year.Rating * * ","genre":null},{"date":"5 December 2009","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Now here's a good waste of pent up potential, with one of the bigger movies of the 1996 holiday season culminating in a largely uninspiring mixture of several elements that by all rights should have worked well together.

He suffers from acrofobia and is retired from the police force, since his fear of heights provokes vertigo on him. He is contacted by the former mate from college Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore), who runs the shipyard of his wife Madeleine Elster (Kim Novak), and Gavin asks him to follow his wife. Gavin explains that she has an odd behavior and seems to be possessed by the spirit of Carlotta Valdes, having blanks of memory every now and then and presenting suicidal tendencies. The skeptical Scottie follows the beautiful blonde on the next morning she buys some flowers and is drawn to places from the past related to Carlotta Valdes, visiting her grave in an ancient cemetery; staring her portrait for a long time in a museum; and finally moving to the Hotel McKittrick where Carlotta lived. In the end of the day, Scottie reports his findings to Gavin. When Madeleine jumps in the water of San Francisco Bay, Scottie rescues her and brings her home. He has a crush on her and they fall in love for each other. When they go together to a mission outside San Francisco, Madeleine runs to the bell tower of the church and the disabled Scottie is unable to reach her; she jumps off the tower, committing suicide. There is a trial and the traumatized Scottie is interned with a breakdown. When he is discharged from the hospital, he meets the brunet seller Judy Barton by chance and her resemblance with Madeleine is amazing. Scottie approaches to Judy and expect to have a second chance in love until he sees a souvenir of a killing. Vertigo is a masterpiece of obsession of Alfred Hitchcock. The timeless complex story is perfect and full of suspense and psychological and sexual tensions. Kim Novak is extremely sexy and has an extraordinary performance in her double role and James Stewart is awesome as usual performing a charismatic character that becomes obsessed when he sees Judy. Barbara Bel Geddes performs an important support character that helps to develop James Stewart's character. The open conclusion is also excellent and the music score is also spectacular and gives a suspenseful touch of class to this film.

The high angled shot of Jake Blues standing behind the yellow line and leaning over is great and when we finally see his face that adds a deft touch to our outlook of the film. His expressionless yet sophisticated notion bouncing off his brother's equally non-emotional face sets the film up for more comic demonstration.As the two drive off Jake is highly unimpressed with the new Blues mobile which encourages his brother Elwood to drive it over the uplifting bridge which in any action film this would get the blood pumping but in this case it will get the mouths moving as the two land, completely unfazed and talk about Jake's redemption and thus the story begins and the music roles.The pair must gather $5000 in a week in order to save their growing up residence, a catholic home where the penguin and Curtis place expectancy on the pair and from there, enjoyable mayhem ensues as they attempt to reform their band.This is an enjoyable feel good motive for a film that encodes religious iconography that does reasonable justice to the faith even if the eventual conclusion of the money earning plan is dealt with too quickly. The intentions of doing the right thing for the right reason are what have won this film over.Which, in a way, is quite humorous. For a story and a situation that should be serious this is frequently hilarious.

Well, forgive me for nit picking, but I didn't think the humour is as strong as it was in New Hope and Empire Strikes Back. Plus, while it was evident, the romantic elements weren't as developed either. However, putting these flaws aside, it is still enormously entertaining, thanks to the elaborate set pieces and the well choreographed battles(the final battle especially was a knockout). And I will say that it is a vast improvement over the prequels. The plot is still fast paced and sophisticated, and the screenplay while not as fun still is as imaginative as ever.I have heard many complaints about the Ewoks. I think it depends on your perspective whether you like them or not; maybe a delight to younger audiences, maybe too sickly cute to an adult. Being a 17 year old female, I thought they were very cute. The acting is still very impressive, with Mark Hamill spontaneously likable in the lead. Frank Oz is a perfect Yoda and his death scene is heart rending, and Ian McDairmund also steals his scenes as the Emperor. Harrison Ford, in an inspired bit of casting is great again as Han Solo, Carrie Fisher is still vivacious and Alec Guiness the great actor that he was is brilliant as Obi Wan. But my favourite is James Earl Jones as the voice of Darth Vader, his majestic booming voice is very ideal for a dark menacing villain. And I must mention John Williams's music, brilliant and innovative, unquestionably one of the best film scores of all time. All in all, while my least favourite of the original trilogy, Return of the Jedi makes for essential viewing. 9\/10 Bethany Cox ","genre":null},{"date":"5 December 2009","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" So what made this movie a step down than its two predecessors?

It pushed the limits on special effects for its time, and the majority of the end result was as good as promised, but it still didn't compromise in content or purpose, and it tied a pretty important lesson into the plot without being preachy or being a stretch.Just because you can, doesn't mean you should. Relevant for its day, and arguably more relevant for ours. This movie basically told the world about moderation, and about keeping perspective in the ever-changing world of technological advancement. It reminded us all that there is an underlying moral issue behind everything we create that should be addressed before the profit is made.It also introduced America to Dr. Ian Malcolm, who despite being a pretentious know-it-all, has a good point about evolution, among other things.Basically, to this day I am still convinced that Jurassic Park is still the perfect marriage of story and effects. The scenery is impeccable for being comprised of mostly extinct creatures and made in the early nineties, and it actually created quite a visual atmosphere. The score by John Williams is memorable, and serves the beautiful artificial scenery well. It's also there for the edgier moments, as is the CGI crew.Jurassic Park may be the most nostalgic movie ever made for me, but I loved it the first time I saw it, and nothing has changed since then. It represents the ultimate movie experience, and I really wish I was a bit older so it could have made its gigantic impression on me on the big screen, rather me seeing it on VHS, and then getting my hopes up for the awful sequels that followed.
