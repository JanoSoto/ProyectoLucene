The beautifully animated has a great story and storytelling, beautiful songs and a great voice cast.Animated movies has been taken to a new level with this movie. This is one of the very first animated movies made for an adult mainstream audience. Still the movie has some misplaced humor and 'Disney' like characters, to make this movie appealing for children as well but really this is more a movie for adults than for children. The movie has a serious undertone and some powerful moments, with the burning bush and the splitting of the red sea as the ultimate highlights of the movie.The characters in the movie are well developed, which is perhaps also thanks to the impressive voice cast that consists out of; Val Kilmer, Ralph Fiennes, Michelle Pfeiffer, Sandra Bullock, Jeff Goldblum, Danny Glover, Patrick Stewart, Helen Mirren, Steve Martin, Martin Short, Ofra Haza. voices that stood out to me were Val Kilmer, Jeff Goldblum and Patrick Stewart. But it of course is also due to the nicely done character animation and storytelling that the characters work out really well and are highly realistic and humane. The character's movement and interacting is done really good and with eye for detail.Another wonderful about his movie is the music composed by Hans Zimmer and friends and songs and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz. It sounds weird, songs for a serious movie but it works extremely well for the movie and the storytelling and on top of that the songs are all from a very high level of prestige.With this movie DreamWorks showed for the first time that they are a worthy competitor for Disney. The movie and its storytelling are really powerful and impressive and help to make this movie an unforgettable watching experience.It's a great movie for all ages but mainly adults.9\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"7 October 2005","score":"34 out of 46 people found the following review useful","review":" The Prince of Egypt is a surprisingly near perfect movie.

My rating of 2 is somewhat arbitrary, but it certainly represents my overall opinion of this film when considering both purely artistic\/film-making elements and the disgusting bias of the film. My discussion is thus in two basic parts that do not really interrelate, but I think that anyone must consider both these aspects of the film.Artistically, this film is for the most part simply excellent. The cinematography, visuals, acting, etc. are all top-notch. The use of shadows, perspective, lighting, smoke, etc., are incredible and excellent for creating a strange, surreal, and utterly frightening impression. Even here, though, there are some problems, though not with the visuals, etc. My main problem for a cinematic point of view, and the one that does tie into the other overarching problem with this film, is how it portrays the main character, essentially a none-too-bright, low-life drug smuggler as some sort of victimized hero. Even if he does not necessarily deserve the treatment he is shown receiving in the film, it is hard to feel much sympathy for such a character. The film even goes so far as to try to evoke sympathy and care for another loser character who complains that he was put in prison for stealing candlesticks or something like that from a mosque. How is one supposed to empathize with scum like that? In the US, that'd be like stealing from from a church and I don't think most people here would view such conduct very highly. It is especially hard to sympathize with such a character when he portrays no remorse for what he did, but instead turns it around on the supposedly evil Turks.This segues into the fundamental problem with this film, which is so inexcusably, thoroughly, and groundlessly prejudiced that this aspect of the film almost utterly negates its artistic value. Not only are the events at least somewhat fictionalized in a way that makes the Turks look worse, but every element of this film is bursting with what seems like simple disgust and hatred for Turks and Turkey without any foundation. Every single thing about the Turks is used to make them look monstrous and inhuman, while the city of Istanbul, an enthralling, beautiful, and vibrant city (although admittedly, the 1970s was something of a low point in the city's life and status), is shown as scary and bizarre. An example is the story about stealing from a mosque, mentioned above. The film even goes so far as to imply that stealing candles from a mosque isn't that bad because, after all, it's just a Turkish mosque, which is utterly ridiculous and disgusting. Even anti-Turkish racial\/ethnic slurs are bluntly stated as if they are totally justified. No culture in the world, now or ever, is even remotely as bad as the Turks are shown here, and I can't think of another film I have ever seen that makes any other nation, ethnic, or political group (not even Nazi-era Germans) look so demonic. I am not a Turk, but I have also been to Turkey several times and I can say from personal experience that Turkey and Turks bear absolutely no resemblance to the nation portrayed here.I want to emphasize that I am not trying to use this as a soap box to espouse political or social views about any country, etc. My discussion of Turkey and the bigotry and falsehoods in the movie are only intended as a discussion about the merits of this film. I touch on the accuracy, etc., of any film that is supposedly about real events, people, places, etc. I would have made the same criticisms had it shown any people or nation the way it shows Turks.

Every shot in the film is perfectly orchestrated, and by keeping the immediate action simple; the master director is able to fully focus on the proceedings, making the resulting film more thrilling. The influence that Psycho has had on cinema overall is astounding, and it's hard to imagine cinema now without this film. The fact that over forty years on, Psycho is still better than every film it influenced is no coincidence. The plot follows Marion Crane; an office worker who is entrusted with $40,000. Seeing her chance to escape her mundane life, she takes the money and runs. Unluckily for her, she stops at a small roadside motel; The Bates Motel. Managed by a quiet young man named Norman, the remote motel has more secrets than it's appearance suggests.Alfred Hitchcock creates a superb macabre atmosphere around the central location. Just the motel itself is frightening, without the rain effects and the psychopath that inhabits it. The master director has proved time and time again that he knows how to handle a movie; and the way that he orchestrates the surrounding here shows that implicitly. Everything about the plot is well worked, and the twist right at the centre of the film shows that. It's hard to carry off a twist like the one here and make it work, as the audience have put so much time and effort into the central character; but Hitchcock is more than equal to the challenge, and the way that he shifts the focus and still manages to retain all the intrigue is awesome to watch. The pivotal scene of the movie is, of course, the shower scene. The technicalities of this scene warrant the seven days that it took to film it, and the resulting montage represents some of the best footage ever to come out of Hollywood. I don't subscribe to the idea of 'less is more' usually, but the shower scene is so skilfully done that it's hard to not respect it.The central character of Norman Bates is, without doubt, one of the most frightening characters in cinema history. Unlike many of the resulting slashers' killers, Norman isn't overblown or even unrealistic; you can really imagine this character being real. Of course, the excellent performance by Anthony Perkins really adds to the character. There are some actors that were made by one role, and Perkins is one of them. The rest of the ensemble work brilliantly together, with Janet Leigh providing the central character until mid-way through, when Vera Miles steps in. It's a shame, really, that Psycho is so well known because now everyone knows it's twist, so it's hard to really enjoy the movie the way that it's intended. I knew the twist already before I saw the film for the first time - so it's lucky that the movie is so good, because otherwise, already knowing what happens could have spoilt it. Overall, there's a very good reason why Psycho is one of the most respected movies of all time. There are some films that you cant be a cinema fan without seeing - and this is one of them.

The plot is pretty thin and has been copied a million times since. But what we have here is a film that is so much more than the sum of its parts.Alien is the first and ONLY sci-fi film where the alien elements seems to be, well&#133;truly alien. Much of this is due in part to H.R. Geiger's disturbing art, as well as Scott's very strict adherence to it. When you see the alien ship, or the chestburster, or the adult alien for the first time, they not only look and feel real, they appear truly bizarre; just how an extra terrestrial probably would.Another reason this film works is the natural way in which the actors play their parts. Dialogue flows in a disjointed but never confusing manner, just like real speech. Everyone reacts the right way at the right moments, and while you never get to know any of the characters very well, it's the believable performances of the actors that allow you to connect with them.Goldsmith's score adds a lonely and distant feel to everything, reminding you of just how isolated and desperate the crew are. I really wish this album would be remastered and re-released in its complete form.

If none of the references in the prior sentence are recognizable to you, then there is a problem. Reservoir Dogs is the film that put Quentin Tarantino on the map and captured the attention of critics and filmmakers everywhere. This low-budget instant cult classic remains a favorite amongst avid moviegoers and also influences a good portion of movies out today. Cleverly mixing dark humor with gruesome and yet realistic violence, witty dialogue, and also a fantastic cast of characters, Reservoir Dogs remains one of the greatest independent films of all time, over a decade since its release. What also makes this film truly shine is its unique storytelling and totally non-linear plot. This film is a true gem.Reservoir Dogs is the story about several men involved in a massive robbery that could result in many stolen diamonds and a lot of cash. After the robbery goes horribly wrong, it is then realized that one of the men involved in the heist actually told the cops about the plan. That is the plot, plain and simple, but what makes this specific plot different from the typical movie story is the way that it is presented. The plot is thrown at the audience like tossed salad, unexpectedly jumping from one event to the next in no particular order. What also allows this plot to shine is the heavy amount of dialogue amongst all the people in the film. The robbery itself is never actually shown, but all the grisly details of what happened as stated by the characters paints a perfect picture of what went on. This is one of the few films to ever come out that can be just as intriguing reading the script alone as opposed to seeing it unfold in the big screen.Casting was brilliant. The top performance in the film belongs to Michael Madsen, who portrays the rather psycho yet very calm Mr. Blonde. Madsen as Mr. Blonde has the standout scene in the film for sure as he flawlessly helps create one of the most humorous yet disturbing scenes ever captured on film. Everyone else did a superb job in adding a bit of realism and drama (and even some humor) into the film, including Harvey Keitel as Mr. White, Tim Roth as Mr. Orange, and Steve Buscemi as Mr. Pink. This film looks like an action film, but contains very little of it, nonetheless remains entertaining because of the suspense and never losing its pacing. It will keep everyone on the edge of their seats up until the very end of the film.Quentin Tarantino is one of the best directors out there, but what helps his status as among the top filmmakers is the fact that he can weave some very good stories. Like all his films, Tarantino keeps his films raw, out of control, uncut, and totally unpredictable. This kind of film-making is rarely ever seen, it is usually him and Robert Rodriguez that are known for producing films that perfectly blend action, drama, and a bit of dark humor. Another thing that separates Tarantino and Rodriguez from everyone else in the business is the careful selection of music. Instead of having a musical score all the way through, Reservoir Dogs mainly consists of several forgotten retro classics, and at many other instances, no music at all. This lack of an orchestrated score is another reason why his films are totally unique, yet unbelievably effective.The movie is much deeper than just a film about a bunch of people pointing fingers, there is much more to it. Requires several viewings, but by the end you will see all the dramatic irony, all the wonderful details in the plot, and even see the foreshadowing here and there. The film is truly a storybook come to life, details and all. The ending was simply perfect, it was totally anticlimactic and that is why it perfectly works. While the film itself is brilliant, the way the movie ended guarantees that Tarantino is not overrated in terms of what he does.Bottom Line A superb film that should be viewed by everybody. There is nothing wrong with this film, and there is good reason why it had such acclaim, despite the lack of box office success.

Probably one thing I'm up to here with is the incredible number of dead bodies, the lousy shooting of hundreds of bad guys and the over use of pyrotechnics. I must admit however, I'm fascinated with the career of Schwarznegger. As it says in this movie only in America - (rather), only in Hollywood.By now I assume it's understood that this is a spoof of action hero movies and especially Schwarznegger's own. Apparently the hard core A-H watchers didn't realize this and were disappointed. That's understandable. Its parody on the genre is a masterpiece, if somewhat complicated. Where can you find an action hero who dislocates his shoulder doing a simple stunt, likes classical music, comes up with the new tag line of rubber baby buggy bumpers, works with a cartoon character and takes the last bullet in the movie with fatal consequences? ( I won't spoil the movie by telling the end of the ending). I liked the supporting cast, and find the whole project hilarious. In this one Arnold is obviously a little tired of the genre himself. So if you can stand to see a few more bodies and explosions done in fun, I recommend you see this one. I believe you'll like it. I'll raise the average with an 8.

Often with his movies, it seems that he can do better; but he continually falls into the childish humour trap, and it spoils everything. Take this movie for example; a spoof of Dracula. Bram Stoker's classic story is ripe for having fun made of it, and while Brooks does implement some scenes that are very funny; much of it is squandered by childishness, and not the good kind. I'm not saying that I'm 'too grown up' for this sort of film, but the simple fact of the matter is that it's just not funny. Adding to that is the fact that even the moments in the film that ARE funny are squandered by the rubbish humour surrounding them. To Brooks' credit, he has moulded the story well around his jokes. He's changed certain elements, but never enough to veer it completely away from the original material. The plot will be familiar to anyone who wasn't born five minutes ago, and follows Bram Stoker's classic Dracula story. Of course, it follows it with a load of gags...but the central plots are still there.Leslie Nielson isn't the actor that you would immediately connect with the Dracula role, but he is the one that usually stars in spoofs; and he does do quite well with the material. Thinking about it, Leslie Nielson isn't a million miles away from the character. Bela Lugosi, the best man to ever play Dracula, is a camp actor and Nielson's mannerisms, while over the top and silly, are a bit like Lugosi's. Mel Brooks stars alongside Nielson as the vampire hunter Abraham Van Helsing. His performance is as you would expect it to be, but he does hold the audience's attention rather well and I would say he did a pretty good job. As mentioned, and as usual for Brooks films; for every gag that works, there's four that don't - but I guarantee that even the most hardened Brooks hater will laugh a couple of times during this film. One scene that sees Dracula using mind control on two women springs to mind for being amusing. On the whole; this certainly isn't a must-see, and I don't doubt that I'll forget I ever saw it soon enough - but it's not Brooks' worst effort.

Still, they form a great friendship which only makes Holden more in love with her. Once Holden reveals his love to Alyssa, they form what seems like a great relationship. Things change; however, once Banky fears that this friendship will affect their long friendship and Holden has to deal with Alyssa's rich past. The Good This is a very well done movie. Kevin Smith is well known for his creative dialog and clever direction in all of his movies, this is no exception.

Seeing people actually close their windows, lock their doors, and speedily flee from the fog in vehicles. Maybe it's just me, but if a thick fog engulfed my house, my first reaction probably wouldn't be one of terror. The story seems all the more ridiculous after summarizing it on paper (err, in an internet comment box).However, John Carpenter has a talent for making potentially laughable stories into frightening, well-made films. The Fog is no exception. Carpenter drenches the film in gorgeous ocean backdrops and a highly unnerving atmosphere that creates a tense, palpable sense of dread. From the first moments of the picture, the viewer is immersed in an eerily silent small town midnight when strange, frightening things begin to occur. This, like many other similar sequences in the film, works very effectively and probably would have faltered at the hands of a director not so well-suited to such a laid-back genre film. At 89 minutes, The Fog moves along at an appropriately brisk pace that does not stretch the entertainment value out of the relatively straightforward story.The acting from such '70s\/'80s staples as Adrienne Barbeau and Jamie Lee Curtis is, for the most part, competently handled. The better performances include those of Tom Atkins and Hal Holbrook. By the way, notice the strange similarity between this cast and that of Creepshow? I don't know if there's any actual connection, but it's amusing nonetheless. Oh, and Psycho's Janet Leigh also makes an appearance.The ending, at first, may seem sudden and anti-climactic, or it might even seem like something of a deus ex machina, but wait a couple more minutes, as Carpenter delivers a fun final And by the way, F--K YOU!

For example I am planning to go to a shopping mall where a murderer is waiting to kill me. Police warned me weeks ahead of time so I changed my schedule. The police grabs the potential murderer telling him we have to fine you because you were planning to murder. If next time you think of doing this again, we will put you in jail. So you save prison costs. Now remember, these pre-cogs can predict events far into the future, not minutes or seconds, but the next day. How do I know that? The movie said so! They predicted events one day ahead while they were treated at the hospital.The plots that really gets me sick is Agatha, if she is so psychic how come she won't tell John Anderton that Ann Lively is her mother and the police chief is the murderer. She should be able to tell can't she? Or she can't remember her mother? How can even John Anderton ever figure out Agatha is the daughter of Ann Lively? There is no part in the story that reveals that fact? O.K. let us be forgiving about Agatha and assume she knows nothing, she don't even know that the police chief murdered Ann Lively. Now how can that be? O.K. Echo. Well, why don't Agatha tell them those are not echo they are different. Why does Agatha even bothered working for pre-cog? What happens if she dies of heart attack, won't the entire pre-crime police be relying on one woman just a bit too much? Or do they have a low quality neroine in the works to make more of these Agathas and kill more innocent children. Sounds like a catch-22, kill more people to save more people? What a circular logic! Why won't Agatha file a misconduct to police department in censoring her on the account of her minority report and that the pre-cogs are fallible! What is wrong with Agatha? Why bother tell John Anderton's son, when he is already dead????? Is she so fallible, I mean super fallible, so fallible it makes me shame especially in the final seen when police head commit suicide, completely wrong! Now assuming that these pre-cogs have pretty good, as opposed to always perfect in prediction you can make use of their talents. Instead of arresting since you are uncertain a crime will take place because these silly pre-cogs are only 50% right, you can still get a crime reduction by 50% through prevention. How? Suppose a potential rapist which the pre-cog predicts will take place at Hyde Park on 3.00 p.m. They are only 50% correct. So the police goes to Hyde Park at 3.00 p.m. The rapist seeing that changes his mind and quit because the police warned him that he may rape someone so they slapped him with a record of warnings. That is enough to just make him think twice.The other issues I have with this movie is what happens with your ID if you have no eyes. Remember the person who sell John Anderton clarity? He had no eyes. For me it seems the chip implant that the U.S. government currently proposing as part of the ID of all people in U.S. makes more sense than to use eyeball ID! Another silly analogies that I really hate in the movie is when John Anderton throws the wooden ball to the other end where the other guy from the Justice department receives and said something like predetermination! Well I would feign a throw a ball to Lt. John Anderton back and throw it in such a away that he can't catch him and I would yell back free will! What about free will? Didn't that element existed even before the final scenes when the pre-cogs made a terrible price by making the predictions wrong.The other part that incensed me is where the police chief kills the son of John Anderton to set him up in some distance the future. It would have been much easier, assuming the head knows John Anderton could be a headache in the future by just transferring him to another division. Give him a good excuse, tell him his son may be kidnapped if he work for this unit! I mean this crime is way too elaborate! If Agatha truly hates to see the future she could make a wrong prediction on purpose and cause the pre-crime units to be closed for business. There is just a lot of loose holes in the story so many that I will just leave this for now. I mean where is the job satisfaction in lying on water all day and all night? Isn't that slavery or something? Wouldn't your body get swell or rot or something? I give 1 star for cool cars.

He's the best part of the film in my opinion and the surprise to me since I became a fan of his in 1994 after watching old Capital City episodes. I believe did his job extremely well and deserved to be listed in both beginning and ending credits of the film. I love John Voight and can't imagine why Angelina Jolie doesn't want much to do with him. I felt Tom Cruise was adequate. I like Vingt Rhames and Henry Czerny in the their roles. I forget the French actress who was Voight's wife. That's too crazy to believe. I thought that Kristin Scott-Thomas and Emilio Estevez deserved more time on screen but that's the movie for you.

Pete is aided in his escape by the aforementioned dragon Elliott who, as well as being green and possessing the ability to turn invisible at will, sports a shock of pink hair and pink wings. Reaching the town of Passamaquoddy, Pete finds temporary sanctuary in the home of lighthouse keeper Nora (Helen Reddy) and her drunken father Lampie (Mickey Rooney), but it isn't long before the family track him down and Elliot comes under the covetous scrutiny of quack medicine man Dr. Terminus (Jim Dale).The mid-seventies weren't the best of times for Disney, and this musical is typical of much of the lacklustre material they were producing. Everyone involved in the technical side of the move seems to be simply going through the motions &#150; and, despite the subject matter, this creative torpor shows in the movie's failure to engage the audience or to arouse any real sympathy for Pete, who simply comes across as just another kid with a dragon.

The human actors never look like they're interacting with the cartoon dragon, and Elliott never displays the human characteristics that so often make Disney's animated creations lovable.
