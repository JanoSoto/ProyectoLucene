There are very few westerns of modern time, or non-animated movies for that matter, that I can allow my daughter to watch. Time and again though I can allow her to watch john Wayne movies.. she and I share the favorites. We both dearly love El Dorado, Big Jake, Hatari and the Searchers Anyway, what it comes down to is this, Eldorado is a remake of Rio Lobo, but that is OK. When you put the greats on the screen together, the fact that hawkes movies are always epic in proportion, always seem larger than life, well it makes for a good movie. I love some modern movies, don't get me wrong, but when it comes down to it, movies from years gone by did not have to rely on car chases, blood, gore, and sex scenes.. there was plenty of romance, plenty of play between the characters, you could feel the sadness, you could feel the pain, without having to see it all. It was a time that allowed more imagination, and I can assure you that imagination is often far greater in depth than what a filmmaker can put on the screen. I think that is part of the draw of John Wayne, Robert mitchum and some of the other greats of that era.. there films were larger than life, without giving up all the details, your mind has to fill in the blanks.. It is a great film, not the greatest but it is a wonderful film and i can let my 4 year old watch it, she is the next generation of John Wayne lover. Her favorites are big Jake and hatari, but this one is very close in her list of favorites. I am writing this because while flicking through the channels looking for something, it was on, and she recognized it right off the bat. It also gave us another opportunity to learn something knew. She is finally old enough to ask about the poem early on, so we looked it up and now it is written on her wall, can she read it, no, but the movie sparked an interest, just as it sparked an interest learning about other breeds of horses, we have horses and we ride, but I had not been able to get her interested in other breeds, but John Wayne on the big appaloosa and caan on the palomino got her asking about their colors and what kind of horses. We have done the same thing with hatari, there are not many American 4 year olds that have a base knowledge of where it is located, the mountain that is there, the Serengeti, the types of animals, as in we looked up each of the animals that they caught. Another thing, there is a strong female character that is so common in hawkes films. I mean he always has a strong woman, sometimes more than one, that is all woman, but still strong.

The film is a throwback to something you might see in the 1930s or '40s - a super-nice, old-fashioned movie led by Julie Andrews, who probably never again looked as pretty and wholesome as she did here.

The kids are all nice, attractive and well-behaved, something else you don't see much anymore on film. Christopher Plummer is the male lead and once he loosens up, he's fine, too, as is the usually-funny Richard Haydn.

This film proves that beyond any doubt. Following a hard-to-read title sequence over a scene of slapstick that would have had(and quite possibly did have) Benny Hill shaking his head and averting his eyes(featuring none other than Bob Todd, who often appeared with Hill), the entire film is a long line of attempted jokes. I say attempted because Lester has little respect for or understanding of comedy(nor the character of mythology of Superman, as has been firmly established); any joke needs proper setup for the punchline to have any effect, and no joke should be *immediately* followed by another, with no room to laugh in-between. This is similar to a recent and unfortunate development in the genre of action films, where a director who doesn't understand the need for the slow-down in-between the major action sequences, to allow the audience to breathe, to take in what they've just seen. Now, without these much-needed breaks in-between, the film basically becomes one very long sketch. Had this been a TV-special with a fraction of the running time and the title Silly Superman, perhaps it would have been tolerable. I don't care much for Pryor. Maybe fans of him will enjoy his performance. The acting is all overplayed... even in the case of newly added Annette O'Toole, who's definitely displayed her talent on Smallville. Clark continues to be a fish-out-of-water and more there for comic relief than anything else. The dialog and various actions of the characters are rarely too credible, and most of the film is marred by the overly comic-book-like tone. The humor has taken what must be the last leap downwards, not only reaching the very bottom but going through it. While the conflict seen at one point in the film, between the good-natured Clark Kent and the now-evil Superman could have proved to be interesting, it isn't used for anything, and ends up simply being an action scene. Near the very end of the film, the quality of the writing takes a solid dive... and yes, I, too, was surprised that it could manage to go any lower. Wasting the potential of an excellent science fiction idea put forth many, many years back and using it just to throw more adversity into our hero's path, the plot twist is unexpected and without any grounds in logic or any remainder of proper storytelling. As if the writer had no actual ideas left, and just threw in whatever sprung to mind. Then again, the film itself seems like one big case of that. The pacing is consistently off. The cinematography retains its comic-book look and feel. The special effects are of slightly lesser quality than the former efforts... easier to tell, less convincing. Margot Kidder, who portrays Lois Lane, confronted the producers of the film to complain about the firing of Donner on the second film... with the result that her part was cut down to an absolute minimum(though so unusually(for this film, and the other by Lester) well-explained that you wouldn't notice it unless you thought hard). To me, that seems like a juvenile act, and an abuse of power(though I will admit, I can't say for sure that I missed the character in this... Lana Lang certainly provided an interesting new development, if one of the only good things in this at all). All in all... this is probably a good place to skip this attempt at making a film series out of the character. This is not a good film at all... and from what I've heard, it only gets worse in the next one. I recommend this to those fans who *must* see every piece of film regarding the hero... and I urge you to save some episodes of Smallville, or perhaps the Singer film(soon to be plural) for after, to see a better representation as well as a more skilled execution of him. 5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"12 August 2006","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Christoper Reeves' biography page contains a quote explaining that Richard Lester, who re-(and, some would say, mis-)directed most of Donner's footage in the second movie and did all of this, was always looking for a gag.

Near the very end of the film, the quality of the writing takes a solid dive... and yes, I, too, was surprised that it could manage to go any lower. Wasting the potential of an excellent science fiction idea put forth many, many years back and using it just to throw more adversity into our hero's path, the plot twist is unexpected and without any grounds in logic or any remainder of proper storytelling. As if the writer had no actual ideas left, and just threw in whatever sprung to mind. Then again, the film itself seems like one big case of that. The pacing is consistently off. The cinematography retains its comic-book look and feel. The special effects are of slightly lesser quality than the former efforts... easier to tell, less convincing. Margot Kidder, who portrays Lois Lane, confronted the producers of the film to complain about the firing of Donner on the second film... with the result that her part was cut down to an absolute minimum(though so unusually(for this film, and the other by Lester) well-explained that you wouldn't notice it unless you thought hard). To me, that seems like a juvenile act, and an abuse of power(though I will admit, I can't say for sure that I missed the character in this... Lana Lang certainly provided an interesting new development, if one of the only good things in this at all). All in all... this is probably a good place to skip this attempt at making a film series out of the character. This is not a good film at all... and from what I've heard, it only gets worse in the next one.

This film proves that beyond any doubt. Following a hard-to-read title sequence over a scene of slapstick that would have had(and quite possibly did have) Benny Hill shaking his head and averting his eyes(featuring none other than Bob Todd, who often appeared with Hill), the entire film is a long line of attempted jokes. I say attempted because Lester has little respect for or understanding of comedy(nor the character of mythology of Superman, as has been firmly established); any joke needs proper setup for the punchline to have any effect, and no joke should be *immediately* followed by another, with no room to laugh in-between. This is similar to a recent and unfortunate development in the genre of action films, where a director who doesn't understand the need for the slow-down in-between the major action sequences, to allow the audience to breathe, to take in what they've just seen. Now, without these much-needed breaks in-between, the film basically becomes one very long sketch. Had this been a TV-special with a fraction of the running time and the title Silly Superman, perhaps it would have been tolerable. I don't care much for Pryor. Maybe fans of him will enjoy his performance. The acting is all overplayed... even in the case of newly added Annette O'Toole, who's definitely displayed her talent on Smallville. Clark continues to be a fish-out-of-water and more there for comic relief than anything else.

The movie takes place in Chicago and I believe it perfectly captures what I consider to be the Chicago mood or attitude (I live in a western suburb of Chicago).Of course the movie is about more than an altar boy who may or may not have committed murder and political corruption.

May go on to distinguished career. However it was not made by a nobody. It was made by Hitchcock and it will be judged in the context of his entire ouevre.The old chap seems to have shaken off whatever religious sense of guilt had been haunting him all those years. What Hitchcock's freedom finally let loose may or may not have been good for him but it was sure bad for the characters in his movies, particularly the women.Basically and briefly, two men are friends -- Rusk (Foster) who runs a fruit and vegetable business in the now-defunct Covent Garden and who is a sadistic rapist and murderer when he's not fondling his grapes, and Blainey (Finch), an ex-RAF officer of reduced circumstances, broke, suspected of the murderers, and rapidly running out of friends one way or another.Blainey has a sympathetic ex-wife (Leigh-Hunt) and a current squeeze (Anna Massey). The former is obviously middle-class and the latter is a sensible and devoted working-class barmaid. The two women are the most admirable characters in the film. The differences don't matter. Rusk does his abominable number on both of them.Well -- that's one thing. But Hitchcock's treatment of the murders is anything but delicate and purposive. Leigh-Hunt's rape and murder is pretty explicit. She squeezes her crucifix and prays during the ordeal but her pleas are unanswered and the director gives us a shot of her dead body, her legs spread, a necktie twisted around her neck, and her tongue protruding in which some docs call the Q sign. Hitchcock doesn't even give her the dignified distance of the death of Miriam, Farley Granger's whorish wife, in Strangers on a Train. We don't get to see Anna Massey violated, but in some ways her death is even more distasteful. Late at night, Rusk stuffs her stiffened body into a burlap bag of potatoes and dumps it in the back of one of the trucks parked near his business. Later, when he realizes that the corpse has a personal item of his in her fist, he climbs into the back of the truck and extracts the stickpin, while the truck rumbles and bounces along the highway. Here it's as if the shower murder in Psycho had been played for laughs. Rusk fumbles and bumbles around, trying to untie the bag's drawstring, scrabbling around in the potatoes and the cold flesh, with Massey's stiff foot poking him repeatedly in the face. His head gets caught inside the bag while he curses. He must break her fingers to release the item. And finally the potatoes begin bouncing out of the open rear, all over the highway, to be followed by the nude body with its green face and agonized expression.His attempts at humor do succeed, but not enough to overcome the general sense of unpleasantness. The humor has to do with the Detective's wife serving him inedible French delicacies such as pig's feet and a soup that seems to have been made out of the innards of the creature from Alien. It's impossible not to watch the detective, poor Alec MaCowan, trying to be polite to his wife while sawing desperately at a sliver of meat from a roasted shrunken bird carcass the size of a canary. And I crack up every time I watch the detective's last attempt at a meal of pig's feet, carrying on a muffled conversation with some inedible piece of hoof tucked away in his cheek. This goes on for some minutes until at the first chance he manages to spit this malignancy out onto the plate, gets up and leaves at once.The two women and the detective are okay. The detective's wife is harmless but dumb. Everyone else is, to say the least, unpleasant. They bark and snap at each other. The hero is especially obnoxious, smashing a wine glass in his hand at a fancy restaurant while shouting at his innocent partner. Rusk, Blainey's phony friend, played with slithering accuracy by Barry Foster, is unspeakable of course. Even the art that adorns his walls is unspeakable. There are two portraits of exotic women, the sort usually found on black velvet. There's a lurid and inept painting of what might have been a scene deleted from The Rake's Progress because it was so lousy. And then, capping it all, there's a photo of Rusk's Mum, who once told him that home is when you go there, they have to take you in. There ought to be a photo of Robert Frost rolling around in his grave.There are two or three of Hitchcock's set pieces. One involves the camera movements while Anna Massey is being done in. The other is the potato sack scene in the back of the truck. Both are effective in their different ways.But it's not any given scene that's disturbing. It's the tenor of the entire film. Cripes, what a view of humanity it embraces! Hitch may be right. People may in general be pretty lousy. It doesn't make the film less sad.Well, I've kind of bombed the movie, I see, but taken as a thing in itself, it's not bad. It suffers mainly in comparison to Hitchcock's earlier work.

It has some great Hitchcock moments, so don't get the wrong impression, but this movie is more character oriented and not so concerned with delivering thrills.It's actually almost a comedy and I would describe it as a light comic adventure film with a touch of intrigue.. Most of the humor is very well done and it hasn't really aged much at all.Overall this movie has a unique place for itself in Hitchcocks filmography. I've never seen another of his films that I would directly compare with this one. It's quite unique, while still being obviously Hitchcockian and it might be one of his very best.

Jones goes along with the idea, even with changing his byline to the pompous Huntley Haverstock, because as he puts it, give me an expense account, and I'll cover anything. Fate intervenes when a photographer apparently murders Europe's last hope for peace right in front of Jones, spurring the reporter to react in a way that leads to a series of outrageously precarious and double-crossing incidents culminating in a plane crash-landing into the Atlantic Ocean.Hitchcock arrived in the U.S. with a flourish, his first Hollywood movie being the Oscar-winning Rebecca, and this his second that same year, 1940. Some back in Great Britain complained Hitchcock's leaving his native country as it faced Hitler all alone was desertion, but Hitchcock was doing all he could for King and Country, as Foreign Correspondent pulls all the stops to shake American viewers from their neutrality.That sort of desperation would ruin most films, but here it only prods Hitchcock to singular and repeated acts of inventiveness as he shakes the tree. We see Jones climb out the window of the Hotel Europe, knock out the letters EL to underscore the film's message, and find his way into the hotel room of the girl he has been trying unsuccessfully to woo. There's an assassination in the rain and shot from above so we see little more than wet hats and umbrellas, and a long sequence inside a creaking windmill that has you thinking our hero's about to be discovered by the bad guys every 20 seconds. The film feels more vital for sequences like this You can't imagine anyone trying to get away with this, yet Hitchcock keeps pulling it off.Then there's the other revolutionary element of the film, its humor, ever-present throughout the picture in a way that doesn't cut against the grain of the suspense so much as amplify it, by keeping you off-guard and invested in the action. This is best exemplified by Edmund Gwenn's plummy turn as an evil assassin (no spoiler, he's introduced to us that way) bent on killing Jones, but so affable and borderline-snarky in his menace you can't root against him as much as you'd like to. As Gwenn's Rowley leads Jones up a church steeple to set up an accident, you wonder how Jones will get out of it but still chuckle at how Rowley tries to keep Jones from going back down You must see the 'orse guards! Gwenn is one of two fantastic examples of reverse casting, the other being George Sanders as a good guy named ffolliett.Hitchcock is very careful in presenting the bad guys. He never says they're Germans, though the implication is obvious. The chief baddie is ruthless but not without decent impulses, in a way that mirrors but goes beyond Willy in his later Lifeboat. Hitchcock knew when the film was released, he would be attacked by those who wanted to keep appeasing Germany. For Foreign Correspondent to be successful, it needed to bring the audience along without noticing the ride, laughing with and pulling for Jones right up until the moment he does a radio broadcast in London while bombs burst around him, an eerie foreshadowing of what Edward R. Morrow would be doing for real only days after Foreign Correspondent opened in theaters.You can't help but admire a film that was on the right side of history, but Foreign Correspondent may play better now than it ever did because of the way its pure cinema techniques work today, a style Tarantino and Leone admirers will no doubt recognize and appreciate, but that anyone can enjoy.

While I still think the other two are superior I did like this and found it to be a somber, provocative, performance driven multi character study and very interesting to watch.The six main characters were all played with excellence but sometimes in a film, there is one performer who walks away with the movie and in this case it is Jason Patrick. I must say this performance ranks up there as one that should have been awarded with an Aacademy Award but wasn't. Although all the characters are interesting, when Patrick is on screen he is just riveting. I first saw him, like so many movie buffs have, in Lost Boys and through the years have admired his performances in movies like Rush & After Dark My Sweet. This is however, hands down, my favorite of his performances and I'm not sure I'd still be giving this film an 8 if he hadn't been in it.This movie is of coarse, about dysfunctional relationships and each performer brings something unique to the role their playing. I found the casting in general to be excellent and though most of the characters are dislikeable, their also interesting and one thing the movie does is get one's attention and keep it. The movie is extremely dialog driven and though it can drag at times, for the most part it stays extremely compelling to watch.Your friends & Neighbors reminded me of such movies as Closer, Sex,lies & Videotape & American Beauty, all of which I thought were superb. It also reminded me of the not superb but still intriguing We don't live here anymore. And it even reminded me a bit of this year's Friends With Money which I liked a smidgen more then this. Although I did not think this was superb, it was well above average and very very good. If one likes any or all of the above mentioned movies chances are they will probably like this.The reason I did not think this was superb was because of a few things. One was the incomplete feeling I had about this film which I did not have about the above mentioned films I DID think were superb. For example,we, the audience, are not told a heck of a lot about any of these people and though we are exposed to their quirks and dysfunctional aspects, not much detail about them other then these aspects are provided. In some of these other films, I really did not have that feeling to the same degree. Also, The ending in my opinion, was weak when compared to the rest of the film although Brenneman's character ending up with Patrick's came out of left Field And genuinely surprised me.(I had thought at first Keener's character would wind up with him since she seemed to hate vulnerability in anyone she was romantically involved with.) I would have liked this movie to supply me with more detail on the characters of these people because there were to many loose ends and to strong an incomplete feeling at the end. I really had a difficult time with that and feel this should have been longer and a bit more structured.As far as the characters' themselves....well Keener's character was so dislikeable it was difficult to feel much toward her other then annoyance. Yet if the movie had shown more of her life other then telling her lovers to be quiet during sex, I doubt I'd have felt that way. Brenneman's character starts off dislike able but she gradually is developed as a lonely and perhaps depressed woman underneath the vivacity and Brenneman does a really good job with the part. (I think her performance is my second favorite.) Aeron Eckert is an amazing actor who's superb no matter what one sees him in and here he's no different. Stiller of whom I'm really not all that much of a fan, was very very good in a dramatic role and should be doing more dramatic material rather then playing almost the same role in in so many comedies. Natasha Kinski has not gotten as much recognition for her role but she should as her character was probably the most likable and had a sweetness and vulnerability that the others lacked, or perhaps wanted people to think they lacked.

Not romantic, not sunny, and definitely more then a little disturbing Your Friends & Neighbors is definitely not your typical movie. My vote's 8 of 10.

On the other hand, it's got a raw energy and freshness that appeals to me. Unlike Leone's other films, it's heavy on action, and is relatively fast-paced. It also feels like something really groundbreaking and new (style-wise, anyway - the plot is apparently copied from Yojimbo). The subsequent films in the series simply duplicate and refine this one's formula.I enjoy seeing Eastwood in the spotlight, all by himself. There's no Lee Van Cleef or Eli Wallach here to hog his screen time. He effortlessly dominates the movie as the sole protagonist, with his supercool persona and dry wit. And his character isn't purely a mercenary; the sequence when he helps Marisol establishes him as a sympathetic good guy, albeit an unconventional one.Equally impressive is Gian Maria Volontè as Ramon, the central villain. Volontè's performance is wonderfully over-the-top, and he has a very intense look that befits the character and lends him a real sense of menace. Leone and the screenwriters do an excellent job building up Ramon as a formidable opponent, making him do increasingly insane and savage things until the audience is bursting to see Eastwood take him down a peg.Looking back at this now, it's easy to see that Leone inspired a whole slew of later directors, including John Carpenter and, most notably, Quentin Tarantino. On the surface, Leone and Tarantino are birds of a feather because they both explore themes of violence and, occasionally, outright sadism. However, in Leone's films the truly sadistic acts are committed exclusively by the villains, and typically there's a few gentle or sentimental moments sprinkled in the narrative. In Tarantino's case, the so-called heroes are often sadists, and there's no sentiment whatsoever. I prefer Leone.Back to the movie, then...as I was saying, it's definitely a little raw, and rough around the edges perhaps, but it's a blast to watch and funny as hell, in a morbid way. You can sense that Leone and composer Ennio Morricone were poised to explode in a really big way, given more time, more money and perhaps more gumption than they had during the making of this film. But, despite its flaws, this is still great and it stands up quite well on its own, without comparisons to the rest of the trilogy. Certainly, if you're a fan of the Man with No Name, this is arguably his finest hour - the best moment in the spotlight for one of the coolest heroes in movie history.

Bruce Dern gives the kind of complex, anguished performance that would characterize the body of his later work. He's certainly got issues in this film, as the biologist of a cluster of forests sent into deep space for safe keeping, the earth having been rendered all but uninhabitable by pollution. When the orders come from Dick Cheney (oops, sorry -- wrong movie -- or is it?) to jettison and destroy the forests, he has to decide between his shipmates and the animals and trees...The real star behind the scenes is rookie director Douglas Trumbull, who would become more famous for his ground-breaking special photographic effects on 2001 and Bladerunner than as the director he aspired to be. This was Trumbull's first time at the helm, a job he took reluctantly because no one else wanted it (the film was made for a shoestring, and shot mostly on location aboard the defunct aircraft carrier Valley Forge, which lends its name to the spacecraft in the film.)This was one of five movies made by Universal on the cheap, after the phenomenal success of the low-budget Easy Rider. Of the five, Silent Running was a modest success, though it suffering from lack of publicity, an erroneous decision made by the bean-counters in the Universal Tower. The other success was American Graffiti. Each movie was made for a paltry one million dollars. It would have been far too easy to turn this film into a movie of the week, with sentiment slapped on with a trowel. Dern and Trumbull deftly avoid this trap with ease, and the movie remains one of the sweetest, saddest environmentalist\/Sci-fi movies ever.

Although without research one would think that this is just a pop song meant to market the movie, that is not true. In fact, that song is based on a song that was originally in the movie, sung by Pocahontas (Judie Kuhn) and John Smith (A surprisingly mature-sounding Mel Gibson) on the night before his execution. The scene was cut because the test audience Disney used, consisting mostly of impatient youngsters, got restless during the song. So as not to seem uninviting to children, Disney cut the song. One would wonder why they did this considering that they wanted Pocahontas to have a more mature, more adult feel than their previous films anyway. They were literally hoping for a Best Picture nomination.So, without the song, what do we have? A film with superb animation, music, acting, dialogue, and characters, but a weak and unbelievable romance. This is crippling to the film because the romance is central to the story. The film is ABOUT that romance. I remember seeing this movie in its original cut, without the song, and thinking that the romance was stupid because it seemed weak. Why would Pocahontas be in love with some guy she met just a few hours ago and who, quite frankly, expressed curiosity in her culture more so than love towards her? This would be a good friendship, but not a good love because there's no emotion in it. The romance comes across as an obligatory, make-the-film-complete romance that many people feel has to be in every major Disney movie. The romance feels like it's there because it has to be, not because it's real. This earns the movie a less-than-stellar 6\/10.With, If I Never Knew You, however, it is a whole different story. It is beautifully written, animated, and sung. It does not further the plot, but it definitely does further the emotion. One can definitely believe that Pocahontas and John Smith are in love, rather than forcing us to take their word for it. In this cut, there's also a reprise of the song at the very end before Smith leaves which echoes this love.At the end of the first version, my reaction was, meh. At the end of the second version (the one that includes If I Never Knew You), I was uncontrollably sobbing.I had cried over a film that I had known the lines to forward and back when I was younger, but never had an emotional reaction to. This song makes the movie feel much more complete, and I would even venture to call this Disney's best film if one includes the song. Some people, especially those who haven't heard the song, might think I'm overreacting, wondering what kind of difference a single song can make. I know I felt that way about people who said this before I viewed the second version. Trust me, watch the second version. It's like watching a different film.

","genre":"Animation, Adventure, Drama"},{"date":"12 August 2006","score":"4 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" My review of this film will definitely be met with some disagreement due to its controversial consensus that if the song, If I Never Knew You, had been in the movie as originally planned, this would be a masterpiece 10\/10 film, and without (which is what happened), it is a 6\/10 film.A little history, to explain this.At the end credits, there is a pop song entitled If I Never Knew You. Although without research one would think that this is just a pop song meant to market the movie, that is not true. In fact, that song is based on a song that was originally in the movie, sung by Pocahontas (Judie Kuhn) and John Smith (A surprisingly mature-sounding Mel Gibson) on the night before his execution. The scene was cut because the test audience Disney used, consisting mostly of impatient youngsters, got restless during the song. So as not to seem uninviting to children, Disney cut the song. One would wonder why they did this considering that they wanted Pocahontas to have a more mature, more adult feel than their previous films anyway. They were literally hoping for a Best Picture nomination.So, without the song, what do we have? A film with superb animation, music, acting, dialogue, and characters, but a weak and unbelievable romance. This is crippling to the film because the romance is central to the story. The film is ABOUT that romance. I remember seeing this movie in its original cut, without the song, and thinking that the romance was stupid because it seemed weak. Why would Pocahontas be in love with some guy she met just a few hours ago and who, quite frankly, expressed curiosity in her culture more so than love towards her? This would be a good friendship, but not a good love because there's no emotion in it. The romance comes across as an obligatory, make-the-film-complete romance that many people feel has to be in every major Disney movie. The romance feels like it's there because it has to be, not because it's real. This earns the movie a less-than-stellar 6\/10.With, If I Never Knew You, however, it is a whole different story. It is beautifully written, animated, and sung. It does not further the plot, but it definitely does further the emotion. One can definitely believe that Pocahontas and John Smith are in love, rather than forcing us to take their word for it. In this cut, there's also a reprise of the song at the very end before Smith leaves which echoes this love.At the end of the first version, my reaction was, meh. At the end of the second version (the one that includes If I Never Knew You), I was uncontrollably sobbing.I had cried over a film that I had known the lines to forward and back when I was younger, but never had an emotional reaction to. This song makes the movie feel much more complete, and I would even venture to call this Disney's best film if one includes the song. Some people, especially those who haven't heard the song, might think I'm overreacting, wondering what kind of difference a single song can make. I know I felt that way about people who said this before I viewed the second version. Trust me, watch the second version. It's like watching a different film. For that reason, my final grade for Pocahontas is 10\/10.
