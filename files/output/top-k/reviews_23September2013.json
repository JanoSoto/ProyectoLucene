The movie revolves around these four people, whom i think were casted and acted PERFECTLY, exactly what they were supposed to be...Jeremy Northam's Italian dude is indeed a wet noodle. He thinks he's all suave and debonair, the lady-killer, the lover, and really he's just a cheesy boob with the spine and self-knowledge of an amoeba. He's dull, weak, and boring, but of course both of the story's women find him just FASCINATING! Why? Because of course oftentimes women are total IDIOTS about the men in their lives, who they fill like empty vessels with their silly-ass romantic notions without ever actually stopping to take a good look at for who they really are.

Why, she's an American adventuress, dammit, and if she wants it all, well it's 'cuz she DESERVES it! Her character is such a conniving but bland and simple see-through bitch (played awesomely by Thurman) that I love how things go for her. She loses her cheesy lasagna lover and gets stuck with the stiff stuck-up asinine old idiot played by Nick Nolte. She gets WHAT SHE DESERVES.Kate Beckinsale is great as the porcelain doll daddy's girl who never had to lift a finger (or work a brain-cell) in her entire life. Of COURSE she's gonna go for the Italian Meatball, but be too pixie-brained, weak-willed and slathered in denial to see that he and her friend are laying pipe together in every old building in England. And of course she ends up with the Prince, who, even though he's with her, will never get over what a slime-ball he is, or ever fully be hers. She gets exactly WHAT SHE DESERVES. And bless his feeble-minded greasy heart, SO DOES HE.Lastly, Nolte's character, the first American Billionaire we're informed, is just an acquisitions man from the get-go, piling up statues and paintings and antiquities (and a daughter and then a wife) just so he can put them in a museum (tomb) in American City and say Hey, Look what I got! Come and look at all this Sh*t that you could never afford! He tells himself and others that he's doing it to give back something to the people, but he doesn't believe it himself for a minute, and neither does anybody else.

Although it might seem like another prison movie with an inspiring message, The Green Mile goes far beyond ordinary. Between a remarkable cast and flawless plot, The Green Mile will have audiences on a roller-coaster of emotions from beginning to end. Tom Hanks (Paul Edgecomb), a prison guard on death row, thinks that he has seen it all until John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan) is brought in. John is convicted of raping and murdering two small girls; however, there is something mysterious about John. Standing twice as tall as the guards, John appears to be capable of harming even the strongest of men, but his demeanor is kind and it throws the audience for a loop. How could a man come off as being so harmless, brutally rape and murder two innocent girls? It is obvious that Michael Clarke Duncan molded himself into John Coffey. The audience can almost feel the emotional pain that John Coffey is going through as the cell door slams shut. It is nearly impossible to imagine the extreme pain that one would go through during an electric chair execution. Not only do the viewer's get to see the execution of Arlen Bitterbuck, but also an execution gone wrong with Eduard Delacroix, played by Michael Jeter. During the execution Michael Jeter's blood curdling screams were so powerful I found myself begging for his suffering to end. The intense physical reaction to the horrific execution demonstrates that the actors clearly did their homework on how to portray their characters. Death row is where the worst of the worst criminals go, and The Green Mile found the perfect actors to make the audience experience how uncontrollable the inmates can be. Tom Hanks, along with David Morse, take control of the unstable Wild Bill Wharton, whose past adds a shocking twist to the story. The Green Mile uses the full potential of the all-star cast to make the audience feel as though they are part of the crew on death row from the beginning of the movie to the very last second. The relationship between John Coffey and Paul Edgecomb is not one that would be likely between a prison guard and an inmate. Since the moment that John is brought into death row, Paul realizes that there is something off about John and his story. Without a doubt, John could easily take down all of the guards and run free, however he doesn't. John stays calm and emits immense sorrow for the crimes he committed. While the other criminals are banging on their cells, John stays calm and pleasant with each of the guards. It isn't until Paul suffers from a painful urinary tract infection that the plot of the story takes a dramatic twist. It is hard to tell if this movie is considered part of the science fiction genre after John displays magical healing powers, helping Paul. A death row inmate going out of his way to help a sick guard? With each twist and turn of the plot in The Green Mile, the audience is thrown on a whirlwind of emotions. Throughout the first half of the movie the viewers get a taste of how frightening the life of a guilty inmate is, but what if the inmate was innocent? Not only does the plot of The Green Mile draw in the audience's emotions making them feel emotionally connected to the movie, but it also creates wonder in the minds of the audience. After watching the movie, I found myself thinking about what I would do if I were an innocent inmate. Never before have I felt as engaged in a film as I did with The Green Mile. It is truly a roller-coaster from start to finish with an ending that changed how I view society and the justice system. The Green Mile is absolutely a must see movie for all who are looking for a movie that will leave them guessing up until the very last moment. There is not another film that could come close to the impact that The Green Mile has on its viewers. Between a remarkable cast who made the audience believe they were part of the film, and a plot that has unexpected twists, The Green Mile deserves the highest rating and a wide range of awards.

Although it might seem like another prison movie with an inspiring message, The Green Mile goes far beyond ordinary. Between a remarkable cast and flawless plot, The Green Mile will have audiences on a roller-coaster of emotions from beginning to end. Tom Hanks (Paul Edgecomb), a prison guard on death row, thinks that he has seen it all until John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan) is brought in. John is convicted of raping and murdering two small girls; however, there is something mysterious about John. Standing twice as tall as the guards, John appears to be capable of harming even the strongest of men, but his demeanor is kind and it throws the audience for a loop. How could a man come off as being so harmless, brutally rape and murder two innocent girls? It is obvious that Michael Clarke Duncan molded himself into John Coffey. The audience can almost feel the emotional pain that John Coffey is going through as the cell door slams shut. It is nearly impossible to imagine the extreme pain that one would go through during an electric chair execution. Not only do the viewer's get to see the execution of Arlen Bitterbuck, but also an execution gone wrong with Eduard Delacroix, played by Michael Jeter. During the execution Michael Jeter's blood curdling screams were so powerful I found myself begging for his suffering to end. The intense physical reaction to the horrific execution demonstrates that the actors clearly did their homework on how to portray their characters. Death row is where the worst of the worst criminals go, and The Green Mile found the perfect actors to make the audience experience how uncontrollable the inmates can be. Tom Hanks, along with David Morse, take control of the unstable Wild Bill Wharton, whose past adds a shocking twist to the story. The Green Mile uses the full potential of the all-star cast to make the audience feel as though they are part of the crew on death row from the beginning of the movie to the very last second. The relationship between John Coffey and Paul Edgecomb is not one that would be likely between a prison guard and an inmate. Since the moment that John is brought into death row, Paul realizes that there is something off about John and his story. Without a doubt, John could easily take down all of the guards and run free, however he doesn't. John stays calm and emits immense sorrow for the crimes he committed. While the other criminals are banging on their cells, John stays calm and pleasant with each of the guards. It isn't until Paul suffers from a painful urinary tract infection that the plot of the story takes a dramatic twist. It is hard to tell if this movie is considered part of the science fiction genre after John displays magical healing powers, helping Paul. A death row inmate going out of his way to help a sick guard? With each twist and turn of the plot in The Green Mile, the audience is thrown on a whirlwind of emotions. Throughout the first half of the movie the viewers get a taste of how frightening the life of a guilty inmate is, but what if the inmate was innocent? Not only does the plot of The Green Mile draw in the audience's emotions making them feel emotionally connected to the movie, but it also creates wonder in the minds of the audience. After watching the movie, I found myself thinking about what I would do if I were an innocent inmate. Never before have I felt as engaged in a film as I did with The Green Mile. It is truly a roller-coaster from start to finish with an ending that changed how I view society and the justice system. The Green Mile is absolutely a must see movie for all who are looking for a movie that will leave them guessing up until the very last moment. There is not another film that could come close to the impact that The Green Mile has on its viewers. Between a remarkable cast who made the audience believe they were part of the film, and a plot that has unexpected twists, The Green Mile deserves the highest rating and a wide range of awards.

The quintet participates in a local monthly talent show with hopes of being discovered. A talent scout unexpectedly sees potential in The Heartbeats and decides to offer them a deal, work with them for a month and, subsequently becomes their manager. After weeks of rehearsal the manager arranges another performance at a more competitive talent show. The group wins the contest and stumbles across a record deal the same night. With the record deal, the boys also get a chance to professionally record their original song. As their career progresses, The Heartbeats struggle with discrimination, substance abuse, and betrayal. The Five Heartbeats offers an entertaining yet didactic depiction of the untold story regarding the problems in the Black American music industry during segregated times. The first example of problems in the Black music industry is racial issues due to separate but equal laws and segregation in the South. After recording their first single, a record distributing company suggested that the song did not fit the group and continued to advise the song be given to an all Caucasian male group. Needless to say, The Heartbeats all but agreed and became even more enraged that the record's cover originally did not have a picture of the group but instead a picture of a Caucasian family at a beach. Because of the low budget the record company gave them while touring, The Heartbeats had to stay in the cheapest areas and survive under rural conditions. To add insult to injury, some of their touring caused The Heartbeats to have shows in the South. While driving the tour car with the group's name and title of their first single, they are unreasonably stopped by the police. The police have The Heartbeats stand outside of the vehicle, ruffle through their belongings and make them sing out of spite and ridicule. The next example of problems in the Black music industry would be drug and alcohol abuse. Lead singer, Eddie Cane Jr., begins to cope with stress and pressure by using alcohol and illegal drugs as many vocal performers have in history. Along with the owner of the record company came a cocaine dealer making drug use enticing to Eddie. Eddie's use of drugs does not alleviate his problems but instead worsens them. He loses his beloved girlfriend, his spot as lead singer, and his melodic voice which also removes his purpose in The Five Heartbeats. Eddie attempts to use Big Red, CEO of Big Red Records, to convince the manager to keep him as the lead singer which may have been Big Red's ulterior motive. However, it turns out unsuccessful and Eddie's once affluent lifestyle immediately declines. The final example of problems in the Black music industry is the motif of betrayal. By trying to persuade Eddie to go against Jimmy, Big Red has an agenda of his own to take over as manager of The Five Heartbeats. J.T. Matthews, brother of Donald Matthews, goes after Donald's fiancée, declaring their love for each other to be untrue because of his feelings for her. Because of Eddie's decline in vocal talent, The Five Heartbeats are forced to find another lead singer, Flash. After using the group to bring his name up, Flash makes an attempt to become a solo artist leaving the group without a lead singer once again. Subsequent to all of the hurt the group has been through Donald removes himself along with Flash never to be heard from again. I personally enjoy this movie because of its entertaining aspects as well as its detailed look into the music industry since that is my desired career. The minor roles and musical selections in the film are what make it entertaining. I would definitely recommend this film for anyone that loves musicals.

After the USA entered World War II in late 1941, it was obvious that Hollywood movie themes would focus on such subjects as espionage, the home front, national defense, and action in the field. Meanwhile Hitchcock's excellent Shadow of a Doubt (1943) drew Hitchcock fully into Americana, the American culture. Before Shadow of a Doubt Hitchcock was already centered on war time America. In Saboteur, Barry Kane (Robert Cummings) is falsely accused of (Nazi) sabotage at a California airplane plant during the dark days of World War II. During a fire of suspicious origin, Frank Fry (Norman Lloyd), a supposed factory worker, had handed Kane a fire extinguisher that he passed onto his friend, Ken Mason. Mason perished in the flames. It turned out that the fire extinguisher was filled with gasoline. As there was no worker named Fry, suspicion fell on Kane, who fled. During his truck ride, he remembered that he had noticed Fry's address on an envelope that read Deep Springs Ranch, Springville, California. At the ranch he meets boss Tobin (Otto Kruger), a gentleman-villain who is onto Kane. Soon rounded up by ranch hands, he escapes the law when he dives from a bridge into a deep river (duplicated notably in 1993's The Fugitive). Still handcuffed, he dries out rather quickly at the house of blind man Phillip Martin (NOT Miller, played compassionately by Vaughan Glaser). Suspense is created when Kane drops a knife in front of Martin's niece Patricia Martin (Priscilla Lane) and hesitates to pick it up because of his handcuffs. We are surprised when the blind man says to his niece that he recognized the sound of the handcuffs early on. Unlike her uncle, Miss Martin does not believe in Kane, and tells him so while they are in her car. So when she later tries to summon roadside help, he uses the time to cut the handcuffs in half using the auto engine fan blade. Tension is created because of Hitchcock's use of multiple cuts between Kane and Lane We wonder, Will Kane win the race and free himself? Anyway, eventually Miss Martin begins to believe in the man's innocence, especially after the two wind up in Soda City (probably Nevada, even though filmed in California, as it is near the Boulder, or Hoover, Dam). Kane calls it The heart of the bicarbonate belt. In the ghost town (since 1923) there is a most unusual coincidence when Pat and Barry inadvertently discover that Hoover Dam may have been targeted. After more than an hour into the movie the setting swiftly shifts to the East. Our hero gets a ride from Nevada without any in-between stops being shown. Continuity suffers No Fort Larned, no Abe Lincoln Home, no Valley Forge! In NY, the villains are still well-disguised Mrs. Sutton conducts a wonderful charity event, and the upper crust bad guys seem so polite. So whom do you trust? Anyway the target is a new ship being launched at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. There is a thrilling theater shootout before an anticlimax at the torch of the Statue of Liberty National Monument. We do not know what happens to the rest of the Nazi sympathizers, but perhaps the director wanted to remind us that enemy agents were still at large at the time and that Americans should be alert to their nefarious activities. Appearances are deceiving in this film, and we cite several examples. According to Miss Martin, Kane looks like a saboteur even though he is innocent. Mr. Martin is blind but seems aware of everything going on around him. Tobin and Sutton appear clean although they are anything but unblemished. Although Soda City is a dead town, unscrupulous activities occur there. Conversely, note that Pat Martin's billboard advertisements are interesting for describing the actions that follow&#x95; You're Being Followed (warning to Kane) &#x95; She'll Never Let You Down (Miss Martin's later change of heart) &#x95; Beautiful Funeral (death in NY)Saboteur features many positives. The opening credits feature a nice introductory music score. Set designs are excellent throughout, and the film is well-paced. We see some attractive USA monuments Hoover Dam, Red Rock Canyon State Park, Radio City Music Hall, Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty National Monument. There is an amazing assortment of distinct characters The circus troupe is right out of Freaks (1932). Priscilla Lane is top billed, along with Robert Cummings. Vaughan Glaser (Glazer) is particularly likable. Unconscionably, he is incorrectly identified in the closing credits as Mr. Miller even though he tells Kane that his name is Phillip Martin. Saboteur may not be Vertigo, North by Northwest or Psycho but it is enjoyable and has a thrilling ending. In time the Master of Suspense would feature other USA landmarks, like Mt.

Lesser actors would had been blown off course from there.Bruce Dern is also cast against type, playing the loud, showy role as his conman older brother with big dreams and a real estate scam which he ropes Nicholson in, Nicholson being the glass half empty kind of guy is rather negative about it all. Not helped that he is also a depressive.Tagging along with Dern are an older and younger lady who help him hustle and Scatman Crothers plays a type of Mr Big that Dern has seemingly upset.The setting is Atlantic City, before it got knocked down and redeveloped with casinos. In that sense we are seeing a decaying city from the past. The acting is top notch, the story has some surreal elements and part of it is hard to follow.

The ever painful subject of racism whether it's educated or from the street, philosophical from the words of Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton), this movie will surely leave you with many thoughts popping through your mind once this movie is over.American History X is a without a doubt one of the most important movies that was released in the late 1990's. Once the smoke is cleared and everyone leaves the theatre, people will look back on it whether they liked the movie or they hated it, there is no doubt that Norton's performance will surely be further discussed. To me he was already a star when he was in Primal Fear and sadly was robbed of an Oscar in that performance. The amazing versatility never ceases to amaze me the way Norton's went through to portray at one hand, a scary, fearsome Nazi skinhead complete with ripped muscles, a bald head, with a swastika branded on his heart, and yet behind his menacing appearance lies a saddened, confused lonely soul who's personal mission was to rectify from his erroneous ways. He is described as a very bright young man with bad intentions and hatred bottled up inside of him from the things he learned from his ethnic-hating late father and his constant struggle to find the real meaning of life.Eternally grief-stricken from a disjointed family, Derek's father's death lured Derek into the realms of Nazism it is quite original that the setting of this movie does not emanate from the South, but rather Venice Beach as a backdrop where hate crimes are quite frequent and rallies to play as Derek serves as the orator for these rallies to promote white supremacy.The turning point of the movie comes when two African-Americans try to steal Derek's car. Derek clad in only his underwear chases the men with a gun and mercilessly kills them both. Sure the scene was cold and graphic and not for the weak at heart, but when the police arrive, Derek is just standing there with a cold and evil grimace on his face, complete with a haunting musical score in the background. As this scene is happening, Derek is seen staring at his young brother Danny (Edward Furlong) who was a witness to the whole incident. Danny looks on at his brother who shows absolute no remorse for his actions, standing like a proud soldier who dished out justice his way. These brutal scenes are some of the most astounding scenes you will ever find on film. These scenes alone sells this movie successfully which is more I can say for the other very rushed and not very to the point scenes. Derek's prison time could have covered more ground, but this movie tried to cover too much details with very limited time.Excellent direction by Tony Kaye to highlight the past in black and white and color for the present events after Derek's discharge from prison.

Deep inside his heart, he looks back with regret and sorrow and rediscovery to find out what he could have done and what he can do to move forward in this new path of life he sets for himself.

Fortunately, Magnum Force really succeeds as a sequel. It is not a rehash of Dirty Harry, but a different kind of take on the iconic S.F. Inspector with the big gun.A year after the Scorpio case, a new threat takes to the streets of San Francisco, in the form or rogue Motrocycle cops, who begin a killing spree of all the city's top crime lords. Inspector Harry Callahan (who somehow has kept his job after the events of Dirty Harry) is on the investigation. His superior Lt. Briggs (played by the very good Hal Holbrook) sees him as a reckless cop who is dangerous in any situation. But Briggs is not all peace and diplomacy as he may seem though. After evidence begins to indicate that a cop (or more) may be involved, he is confronted by said Magnum Force to join them to rid the city of all crime.This film, written brilliantly by Michael Cimino and John Millius, adds a new layer to Harry's character. When confronted by the cops involved, they remind him of his hate for the law and the red tape that would allow the crime lords to walk free and keep doing what they are doing. However, Harry will not resort to complete vigilantism, and will try to stick to the law, even if he hates the goddamn system, but until someone comes along with some changes that make sense he'll stick with it. The reason why I give this aspect of the film so much praise is that it fleshes out Harry's character a little bit more,showing him as a cop who will protect his city but with limits on what he will do. That is why i love the line A man's got to know his limitations. He uses it on Brigg's at the beginning as a joke (much like his Do You Feel Lucky, Punk?) But also like that quote, in the end when all villains are revealed and taken care of, it has much more significance.One thing that is is escalated in Magnum Force is the action scenes, with car chases, and even a airplane-hijacking. These scenes work very well, and keep in context with the story. The climax on the old aircraft carrier is a very good scene to, very tense, and very dark as it would be on a ship like that.This sequel wouldn't work unless you had some good acting, and the acting here is very good actually. Eastwood is still in top form as Harry, and gets more emotion and conflict during this film than he did in the last one, especially when his reputation is called into play and what he believes in is questioned. The men who play the bike-cops are very good, and they include David Soul (before he played Hutch) All all played as rookies, and very convincingly. Hal Holbrook is great as always playing a very snide and very proud Lt. Briggs.This sequel really works. it may be a bit rough around the edges, and dare I say, a little too long to play out.

It draws us in quickly with the drama of a cheating wife and the actions of a scorned husband. However, what really brings us in are the deep soothing tones of Morgan Freeman's (Driving Miss Daisy, Unforgiven) voice-over as Ellis Boyd Red Redding speaking about his insights into Andy Dufresne.Andy Dufresne is the scorned husband, played by Tim Robbins (Bull Durham, Mystic River), who is accused and convicted of murder even though the evidence is circumstantial and he maintains his innocence. He spends the next twenty years at Shawshank State Prison where he meets Red. Red is one of the guys in the prison who has a way of getting anything one might want smuggled into the prison. One of the first things that Red notices about Andy is that he conducts himself as a free man who is unaffected by the surrounding prison. Andy has difficulty at first as he falls prey to a group of inmates called the sisters and referred to as bull queers. This goes on until Andy shows his worth as banker to the lead guard, Captain Hadley played by Clancy Brown (Highlander, Starship Troopers). Hadley provided Andy's inmates with beer in exchange for Andy's services. The beer made the inmates feel like free men again and Andy's services got him noticed by the warden. The warden, played by Bob Gunton (Patch Adams, Evita), provided Andy with protection from the sisters, allowed him to fix-up the library, and allowed him to help some inmates earn their high school diplomas in exchange for Andy's help with laundering money that proceeded from the warden's many schemes. So, we are presented with a bleak situation that is reinforced by dirty sets and mostly gray and blue colors. The make-up used to age the actors gradually over twenty years, combined with the acting, work together to make us believe that all of this could happen and is real. We are made to feel sorry for these inmates most of whom are suffering the consequences of their own horrible crimes. And, as if doing the dirty work of the self-righteous who stand in judgment over Andy isn't enough, the warden has the one person who can get Andy out of prison executed. In spite of all of this Andy maintains a hope for the future that they can't touch.

Firstly, very few of them actually contain interesting characters and subject matter with Les Miserablés being a recent, remarkable musical\/example. Then, there was the whole eventual boredom that would emanate from the film's constant dancing, singing, and stylistic and unnatural reliance on choreographic performances. Fortunately, in this case, Singin' in the Rain managed to surprise me with its sheer quality and entertaining nature. Attuned to what I previously claimed, the picture features incredibly charming characters with Don Lockwood (played by the great Gene Kelly) being a very clear exemplar. Normally, Hollywood films in that era would portray relationships in largely superficial and (negatively) theatrical fashion. The couple would persistently utter hackneyed lines to one another. Some might find them beautiful, but I find them horribly clichéd- that is unless the pairing has a charisma and charm to them that's able to separate the two from the generic Hollywood romance that was customarily depicted on-screen during those times. In this instance, Don Lockwood and Kathy Selden (a rare beauty played by Debbie Reynolds) commence their unorthodox relationship with a stir of skepticism in which Kathy doesn't quickly wrap herself up in the famous star's arms. Her likability and credibility is earned by her resistance to his glamour. This effectively displays her character as strong-willed and alluring- she's not the kind to thoughtlessly sleep with a guy the day she met him because he's a worldwide sensation; no, she's the kind that's hard to obtain. At this point, the male audience (or, at least, me) immediately find themselves resonating with Don because I'm sure most of us have come across a woman we painstakingly loved but were unable to attract without great effort. This fascinating relationship follows in a similar manner throughout the film until they realize the appeal of one another. In sum, the terrific chemistry between the two characters is self-evident from the absolute start, which is also wondrously contributed to by exceptional acting performances. On another note, the soundtrack is quite delightful and classic in its melody and rhythm and provides for astounding choreography. With that being said, though the feature is predominantly entertaining and clever, it slightly loses its pace with its middle act in which we're introduced to non-stop singing and dancing. The intriguing story is compromised and temporarily paused while the filmmakers use this precious time to showcase the musical performances as this is a musical at the end of the day. Unfortunately, that particular segment (prolonged, indeed) lowered the film's overall quality and troubled it with a highly noticeable flaw. When I was discussing the unrealistic look of musicals at certain moments towards the beginning of my review, this is exactly what I meant by their unattractive aspects. When all is said and done, Singin' in the Rain was a pleasing experience, and although it was considerably hurt by its second act, I hope my memory of the film will be dominated by its satisfying plot, characters, music, and cinematically historical significance, which all drastically overshadow that one meandering element.

You might after watching it find some things funny, others just plain strange, and end up feeling eh about the movie (probably why the movie has an overall score of 6.6). To be honest, I felt the exact same way when I watched the movie for the first time. However, as it is a favorite of my parents, we would watch the movie about twice a year. I found, to my surprise, after each time I watched it I saw or heard things that I missed, found things funnier, understood references or jokes etc, and grew to love it. My point is this So you may not like it after the first time you watch it, but give this movie a chance and, you'll love it and watch it for the rest of your life! (hope you don't have commitment issues ;). And trust me on this, you'll be quoting The 'Burbs for years to come. Enjoy!

It follows the protagonist, played by Winona Ryder, as she is institutionalized in Claymoore (McLean Hospital in real life). There, she mingles with a pathological liar (DuVall), a burn victim (Moss), a disturbed daddy's girl (Murphy), an anorexic (Bettis), a dyke (Armenante)&#x97;but chief among them is the charming, but heartless sociopath Lisa Rowe, played by Angelina Jolie.What piqued my interest about this film was the immense praise Miss Brother-Smooching Jolie earned for her performance as a female McMurphy. I've never really enjoyed Miss Jolie in general, as her attempts to be quirky and surreal come across as arrogant rather than endearing. However, I will admit that this is a powerhouse performance. Something that Jolie is talented in is portraying authentic reactions to the events surrounding her character. Lisa Rowe is a very generic sociopath who's observed from a bird's eye view, and whatever credibility this character has is betrayed in the second half of the movie; but in spite of it, Angelina isn't trying to force her mannerisms down our throats. It's clear that she's enjoying every trait of her role, but her performance is very raw.Now, onto Ryder...I am also not a fan of Winona Ryder, as her talent is often stilted by very whiny, self-indulgent characters. She has powerful eyes and can be expressive when she has to, but other films such as Alien Resurrection and Autumn in New York severely waste her talents, as she comes across as bratty and bored rather than enveloping herself in the plot. She is surprisingly decent in this film, but pales in comparison to Jolie. Jolie is fierce and bold in her role as Lisa whereas Winona is fairly stagnant throughout the film. However, there are several scenes where Winona did pull me into her character's drama, particularly when the final showdown occurs between her and Lisa, as well as the final scene between the two (which is admittedly sappy, but the camaraderie does seem genuine at this point).However, I do have problems with how they portray Susanna Kaysen in this movie. Most of her dialogue is very cloying and morose with little to relate to. They use the term Borderline Personality Disorder rather than examine the symptoms of BPD. The Susanna portrayed in this film has few scenes that hint at her diagnosis, i.e. her impulsive sexual activity and her brief mentions of depersonalization. There's a lot more to BPD than that. The movie only scrapes the surface of our main character's condition, and it tricks the viewer into believing that BPD is only about being rebellious rather than truly seeing the helpless paranoia they go through.That leads to another problem in this movie the characters' diag-nonsenses serve as thinly-written clichés rather than complex development. Both Susanna and Lisa's conditions aren't truly understood and can even come across as childish. The two leads are labeled as rebels but rarely showcase the truth behind their mental illnesses. I have discussed the phoniness behind the diagnosis of BPD in the film, so I won't drivel on any further than that. Although I have praised Angelina Jolie's authentic and even disturbing performance as Lisa, her character disappointed me. I am unsure if James Mangold really understands sociopathy, as Lisa's breakdown in the end makes no sense whatsoever. A sociopath would not be disarmed because a target is no longer easily manipulated. Sociopaths will find new bait no matter what. Again, if we really delved into Lisa's psyche rather than embellish her Hollywood Bad Girl label, maybe it would be more effective.As for the other characters, they are portrayed by good actresses, but I wish they were given more screen-time. Some of the nervous breakdowns these characters have never struck a chord with me&#x97;such as Polly's self-deprecating freakout because of her scars, and M.G.'s breakdown influenced by Lisa&#x97;because I never got to know them. Personally, if Brittany Murphy's portrayal of Daisy Randone was given more development, she would've garnered immense praise as well. The same goes to the other actresses. They all have talent and just by watching them, I can tell that they have the ability to convey raw emotion. However, it's all pushed aside for the Kaysen-Rowe camaraderie that has its ups and downs throughout the film...particularly in the second half.The events that lead to Susanna and Lisa's final showdown is when the movie succumbed to cheap Hollywood Shark-Jumping. As stated by the real Susanna Kaysen, while she was enchanted by Lisa as the others were, she never had a close bond with her in particular. She and Lisa never ran away together; Daisy did not kill herself because Lisa pushed her buttons, and Lisa never had a mental breakdown because of her deteriorating friendship with Susanna. To say it was melodramatic drivel would be an understatement. This is where Mangold really misses the point of Kaysen's memoir. The point of the memoir was to examine social nonconformity, and why it is often mistaken for insanity. The atmosphere of the memoir is sacrificed for a cheap plot line that has Susanna go through great denial and impulsivity until she realizes, gasp, Lisa may be crazier than she is. It's one thing to alter some things according to the Law of Adaptation, but sacrificing the entire point of the memoir for the sake of appealing to bad girl redeemed plot line we've seen over and over truly disgraces the source material.In the end, Girl, Interrupted is a guilty pleasure of mine. It appeals more to superficial diagnoses rather than honor the source material, which greatly damaged my expectations for the film. But if you're interested in watching the movie solely for the acting, I suggest you rent this one.3\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"23 September 2013","score":"","review":" Girl, Interrupted is a 1999 film based off of Susanna Kaysen's memoir of the same name.
