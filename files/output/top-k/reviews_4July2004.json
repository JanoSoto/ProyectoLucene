[{"date":"4 July 2004","score":"5 out of 11 people found the following review useful","review":"  WAKING THE DEAD (2 outta 5 stars)Writer\/director Keith Gordon has made some really fantastic movies that most people never see or hear about (A Midnight Clear, Mother Night) so I was very excited about seeing this one.  Unfortunately, I have to say that it's not up to his usual standards.  Billy Crudup plays an idealistic young man with dreams of winning a seat in the US Senate.  Jennifer Connelly plays the idealistic young girl he falls in love with who has a slightly more radical take on government.  The events of the movie take place out of the linear time sequence.  The movie starts with Connelly's death and backtracks to when they first met... and it leapfrogs back and forth forever after... as the latter-day Crudup begins to have visions of his dead girl coming back to life.  Is he crazy?  Is she a ghost?  Or did she fake her own death?  The acting is pretty good... especially by Crudup, who gets all the showy, emotional breakdown scenes... but the script and story are a bit on the bland side.  Not a bad movie... but kind of slow... and after all is said and done... doesn't really leave you with much.  (A good movie for playing Spot The Canadian though... as all the smaller roles seem to be played by familiar Canadian actors... Molly Parker and Leah Pinsent among them.)

Not only was the visual concept of the animating over DV picture awesome, but the philosophy of the whole movie was great. For those who thought the movie was boring or who expected it to be like Before Sunrise or School of Rock, I'm sorry but you where very wrong. If you thought the movie to be boring then I think the concept of it might be to high for you, and I recommend something else.The basic idea for those who are interested is; Wiley Wiggins (main character) is struck by a car after coming into town. This causes Wiley to fall into a sleep. The rest of the movie takes place in Wiley's lucid dreams. He knows he is dreaming and in fact has woken up. But only into another dream. He talks to many people about the idea's of dreams and of life. Hence Waking Life.I highly recommend this film to anyone.

In this case, in lieu of Scotland, Ireland, or Northampton, we are treated to Wales.  For Americans who long for a break from the things with which we are commonly inundated -- like myself, a film like this is like a much-needed holiday.  It's a fanciful fable and narrated accordingly.  Colm Meaney (known to Star Trek fans as Chief O'Brien) is really the movie's true protagonist and gives the film its most energetic performance.  His foil is the 80-something but believed to be 60-something Reverend Jones; this actor's performance is sheer perfection.  Hugh Grant is fine as the feckless nephew beguiled by the Welsh town -- but he's more like Michael Crawford's Hero in A Funny Thing Happened to Me On The Way To The Forum than the movie's real star.  The actress playing his love interest is beautiful but lacks chemistry and empathy with her co-stars. The actor playing Grant's Uncle George, the surveyor, is lacking in the screen presence needed to pull off his domineering-little-Napoleon type of character he represents.  The townspeople are uniformly right-on-the-mark.  The script has just the right touch of wry humor.The photography is excellent, but the background music could use a bit lighter touch.   Overall, I think most people will enjoy this droll trifle.  I give it 8\/10.
