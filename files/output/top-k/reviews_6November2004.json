I think that exceptions to this rule are becoming more common these days (Master and Commander was very impressive) but only when helmed by especially conscientious and meticulous directors. And no director was ever more conscientious and meticulous than Stanley KubrickWith Barry Lyndon, Kubrick does for the period picture what 2001 did for science fiction, what Dr. Strangelove did for the comedy, and what Spartacus may or may not have done for the costume epic. There's little enough by way of definite plot here, just Ryan O'Neil trying to make his way through life in the 18th century as best he can. It was a period where society's chosen ones could live like gods, and the unlucky could descend to sub-human squalor, and it was perfectly possible to do both in a single lifetime. It was also the Age of Reason, where weakness of nerve or instinct to self-preservation was considered much less important than a gentleman's agreement.It's passed into film legend that no artificial lighting whatsoever was used in filming. This wasn't quite the case -- it was unavoidable for a few scenes -- but Kubrick was hell-bent on minimizing it as much as possible to get the authentic effect of rooms lit all by candlelight. Kubrick's background in still photography was apparent in A Clockwork Orange, but he's taken on a painter's eye here -- logical since 18th century painting offered an entire world of research material.This is, in the end, a very visual film. As such, the level of acting isn't as memorably ingenious as in some of Kubrick's other films. An excellently written narration track and some ingenious text at the climax is needed to really tie everything together. But this movie apparently still gave Ryan O'Neil's career enough of a boost that two years later he ended up headlining A Bridge Too Far with the likes of Sean Connery, Michael Caine, Gene Hackman, and Elliot Gould. Just another day's work for Kubrick. This isn't his best-known work, but it's still a masterpiece.

Another of these is a film I caught as a midnight showing at a local movie theater, 'The Shining', directed by Stanley Kubrick and adapted from Stephen King's classic novel of the same name. 'The Shining' has become such a pop culture phenomenon, parodied by everyone from Saturday Night Live to The Simpsons, that it is easy to forget to look at what a fantastic film it really is.Set in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, 'The Shining' tells the story of a small family who are hired to take care of a large hotel\/resort during the off-season. This is an ideal situation for the father, Jack (Jack Nicholson) who plans to spend the time working on his novel, his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and young son Danny (Danny Lloyd) if not for a couple of key factors. Firstly, the hotel gets snowbound in the winter, so leaving isn't an easy option. Secondly, the family has its own problems; Jack is a recovering alcoholic who has been abusive in the past, Wendy is fragile and nervous to the point of near-collapse, and Danny is a borderline schizophrenic whose alter-ego Tony manifests himself as a barking voice coming from Danny's right index finger. Oh yes, and the hotel is haunted by the spirits of guests, servants and their families who have died there in the past. All of these factors make up a spooky story that, when coupled with Kubrick's exquisite direction and cinematography, makes for a pretty creepy little film. His use of light and color (always with the red), unconventional score (always with the jarring piano) and serious creepy imagery are as amazing as always. The flashes of the twins, even after seeing the film many times, still make me shiver, and the tracking shots following Danny as he rides around in his Big Wheel still make me cringe every time he takes a corner. What Kubrick does best with 'The Shining' however is the slow pace he makes us follow until the action story crescendos near the end. Rather than construing this as a pacing issue, this is more of a simmer, then a slow boil, and finally a boil over. As I said earlier, this isn't a very compelling review because there has been so much said about the film that I can't possibly add anything in the way of significant interpretation and exploration in a forum this short. What I can say in testimony to this film's relevance, appeal and ultimately, longevity is that the theater I screened 'The Shining' at was packed with people, from adolescent to middle age, which I personally found pretty neat, being such a fan of Kubrick's work. 8\/10Shelly ","genre":null},{"date":"6 November 2004","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" There are so many films that I have reviewed for the last year and a half that are such classics that there isn't a lot more to add to the mix.

It raises all sorts of questions about personal identity, memory, guilt, truth, and time for example, if you commit a murder but do not remember committing it, are you still guilty? What does it mean to be 'the same person' that you were last week, or last year? Memento implicitly raises these questions, in a subtle way, without being heavy-handed in the way that the Matrix is, for example. The real genius of this film is that, while it raises all these issues and is genuinely thought-provoking, it manages at the same time to be a truly entertaining, tense, and compelling thriller.The story revolves around Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) who, after a blow to the head, suffers from a neurological condition which means he cannot form new memories. He can only remember things for a few seconds, and then they fade away. This means he has to write himself notes, take Polaroids, and even tattoo himself to try and form some kind of continuity in his life. He has no idea who to trust, where he lives, or even where he was five minutes ago. All of this complicates Leonard's quest in life, which is to find the man who raped and murdered his wife, (and caused his own condition) and take his revenge.This is a genuine neurological disorder which I had read about in a piece by Dr Oliver Sacks called 'The Lost Mariner', and I was fascinated when i heard there was a film dealing with the subject. I didn't think it would be possible to really depict this condition in a film, so I was amazed by the skill of the director, Christopher Nolan, who really makes you appreciate the tragic and horrific quality of this condition.It is a stroke of genius on Nolan's part that the film itself runs backwards. Or rather, while each moment of the film runs forwards, we see Leonard's life in a series of small chunks lasting a few minutes, which we see in reversed chronological order. This is an incredible use of film to make you understand the sort of endlessly unknown, frightening world that Leonard lives in. It means the viewer has to make that little bit more effort to understand what is going on, it demands a bit of intelligence and attention. Unlike most Hollywood films, it's not a simple progression from mystery, to disorder, to the solution. It's more complex than that. When someone comes in and speaks to Leonard, we are in a position like his - we don't know if he has met them before, if they are friend or foe, whether or not they are telling him the truth. The pace, direction, script, and acting are all outstanding. All three of the leads (Guy Pearce, Carrie-Anne Moss, and Joe Pantoliano) give excellent, gripping performances. I was impressed that the female lead, Natalie (Moss) is not just used as eye-candy or objectified, but is a fully developed and intriguing character (all too rare in Hollywood films). The cinematography is gorgeous, with great use of colour and light to create atmosphere. The music too adds to the tense and gripping nature of this film.In short, this is one of the best films that I've ever seen, and I strongly recommend it to anyone who enjoys films that are a bit different.

Before, you jump on me, let me say that I do not feel it is one of the best films of all time- I just think that the elements all came together very well.The heartbreaking opening scene, with the haunting score that appears throughout, immediately show us that Carrie is one of those that is doomed to be an outsider for life. This theme is consistent as Carrie encounters every character from the sympathetic and caring Miss Collins to the downright wicked Chris Hargensen. This film is driven by characters who we either love, hate and feel so-so for ( Tommy Ross )- which makes us invest our emotions into it. We see that Carrie is tragic and we feel for her because she goes through so much, both at home with mother and at school with her tomentors. We're happy for her when things seem to go right for the first time. The slow-motion sequence after she is named Prom Queen is just as delightful for us because she finally has gotten a taste of what it means to be noticed and cared for. Again, we become invested emotionally in this story.Then, the world collapses. Carrie realizes that all of this has been yet another joke- of the cruelest kind. And she's had enough. Suddenly, the anger builds and reminds us of her gift- which because of the way the story has been written, we forgot about for a while. But now, we are terrified. Because we've all wanted to lash out and hurt those who have hurt us. And now she has the chance to totally destroy everyone that has hurt her for so long. We don't necessarily approve of her actions- we just watch in horror.And finally, as she returns home, seeking nothing more than some love and care and warmth, she is met with hatred and anger- making her the tragic figure again. As kids, we all have moments where others are cruel. And for us, Carrie is a reminder of that pain and the terrible thoughts we have had. That's why it is a horror story to us. That... and Brian DePalma is a genius.

Before, you jump on me, let me say that I do not feel it is one of the best films of all time- I just think that the elements all came together very well.The heartbreaking opening scene, with the haunting score that appears throughout, immediately show us that Carrie is one of those that is doomed to be an outsider for life. This theme is consistent as Carrie encounters every character from the sympathetic and caring Miss Collins to the downright wicked Chris Hargensen. This film is driven by characters who we either love, hate and feel so-so for ( Tommy Ross )- which makes us invest our emotions into it.

Broccoli, director John Glen, and new screenwriter Michael G. Wilson (Broccoli's stepson) wisely chose to scale the next Bond film way down to the modest trappings of From Russia With Love, basically by stealing the same plot. And while For Your Eyes Only doesn't reach that level of greatness (no Bond film has since 1963), Roger Moore's fifth effort is still an exciting, unique, and fun way to spend 2 hours.As mentioned, the plot is extremely simple a secret spy ship, which was carrying the ATAC decoding machine, sinks off the coast of Greece and a British researcher is murdered while looking for it. James Bond is sent to follow up on a lead, stop the evil villains looking for the ATAC, and find it himself before it gets into the wrong hands. While on the mission, he encounters the daughter of the researcher, Melina (Carole Bouquet, who is actually a bit stiff) and stumbles onto a war between two former friends.With any Bond film, there has to be some action scenes, and FYEO is chock full of them. There's a wild and unusual car chase, a raid on a shipping port trafficking drugs, a thrilling climb up to the villain's base, and probably the best ski chase in a Bond film that also takes advantage of a bobsled run. Not one of these disappoint, and the stunt co-coordinators should be proud.It was a bit hard to lure Moore back into the role, but it was well worth whatever they paid him. He gives in what is probably his best performance, with some genuine and rare emotion. One scene that Sir Roger even objected to shows what Bond really is, an assassin, and that's when he kicks a car with an unarmed man over the edge of a cliff. Even with this new hard edge, he still finds a way to be charming and his usual funny self in some other moments, even if he has aged more noticeably since his last film. He even gets into some very physical fight scenes which are heavily appreciated.The movie contains a well-rounded cast that includes Topol as Columbo, Julian Glover as the two-faced Kristatos, Michael Gothard as the silent Locque, and Pierce Brosnan's wife Cassandra Harris as Countess Lisl von Schlaf. While Locque is pretty creepy, Kristatos doesn't really pose much of a threat to Bond. Nothing wrong with the actor, but he doesn't have the gravitas one needs to be a Bond villain. Neither does his henchman, Erich Kriegler, who is an inferior carbon copy of Red Grant.A first for a Bond film is that this one also has it's share of minor sub-plots, which could be interesting in a television show, but here detracts from the main story line of finding the ATAC. These include a romance with under-aged Bibi Dahl that doesn't work at all, the Schlaf affair, and even the raid on Kristatos' warehouse. What's interesting, though, is that most of these elements where lifted word for word from Ian Fleming's short stories, Risico and, appropriately, For Your Eyes Only, so it's hardly a surprise that they don't connect directly and the writers should be commended for bringing these elements into play at all.I also love how the Columbo-Kristatos feud and Melina's revenge plot fits into the story, and with all this going on, it's amazing how they fit it all into little over than two hours! On top of all this, the almost gadget free nature of the film makes Bond have to use his wits, so that why he didn't just jet-pack his way up the mountain; he has to climb it. Finally, the world isn't at risk, which has Bond free to go around Europe in a much more interesting treasure hunt.But, like any Bond film, For Your Eyes Only isn't without it's faults. The musical score by Bill Conti is a unique departure from the norm, but is sometimes too loud and seems to be stuck in the '70's. The two bookends of the film, the beginning and end, are in no way related to the rest of the story and just scream tacked-on. They are just too ridiculous to fit in with the rest of the fairly serious tone.So, while The Spy Who Loved Me is Moore's best and most entertaining venture into the world of Bond, FYEO does a great job at doing something different, and with it's blend of exciting action sequences, good locales, intrigue, and an involving story that keeps the viewer interested, this is my 6th favorite 007 adventure and I recommend it to anyone. 8.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"6 November 2004","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" After the parody that was Moonraker, producer Albert R.

True, they are not the masterpieces that Vertigo and Psycho are, but I don't think they are all as bad as some claim. I finally got a chance to see Frenzy, and I must say that it's a great piece of typical Hitchcock thriller. The story is about a killer who strangles women with a necktie, after raping them. After a bunch of unfortunate(but not unlikely) situations the police suspect the wrong man, and we follow his actions as he tries to evade the police. Like all the Hitchcock greats, it features great characterizations, dialog and situations. Not to mention those little details that lift him above the level that most other directors are at. The plot is very good, and well-paced. The acting is very good; I was particularly impressed at how 'British' they managed to be, considering how many of the actors are Americans. I suspect Hitchcock played a big part in making the film so authentic and true to life. The characters are well-written, credible and interesting. The suspense and tension is extreme at points of the movie, and Hitchcock (once again) proves his perfect understanding of the film-making elements and his ability to put them to good use. I found it interesting to see so much nudity, in a Hitchcock film. Of course, it wasn't just graphic and pointless, like it is in most films(not just from that period); it's there for a purpose. The famous continuous shot looked great, though it was obvious where the cut was. Hitchcock is known for his innovative shots, angles and pans, and this is no exception to the greatness of his cinematography. I doubt that we have seen a much more innovative or intelligent film-maker since him. It's nice to be able to see that even such a short time before his death(about 8 years, I suppose), Hitchcock delivered something so great. Much better than the dime-a-dozen flicks that most films released consist of today. A great film for any fan of Hitchcock, or even of thrillers in general.

One might even be tempted to make fun of the character. But if one was to watch the film from the beginning, one's sympathy with John Merrick (John Hurt), 'The Elephant Man,' would be strong enough to deny that the former situation was ever a possibility. Lynch does not allow his audience to glimpse Merrick sans mask until his appearance has been built up substantially. When we the audience are at our zenith of anticipation, we see him-no dramatic music, no slow motion; a simple cut and he's there. There he is. And it's no big deal. This is the beauty of Lynch's direction. We are led through our morbid curiosity at the same rate the characters in the film are. We develop alongside them. More specifically, we develop alongside Frederick Treeves, played with an astounding sublimity of emotion by Anthony Hopkins. Next to Treeves we pity Merrick, respect him, pity him again, and then ask ourselves with him, 'is he just a spectacle to me? Am I a bad person?'Lynch certainly doesn't let us bypass this question easily. Are we bad people for being intrigued or are we good people for pitying? Certainly there is a mix of intrigue and pity with every character who first meets John, and we are not excluded. However, as with almost every character who truly comes to know John and confer with him, we learn to respect him as a human being and not as a spectacle. Nonetheless, this issue never finds close in the film, nor do I feel it ever can be closed in actual life. Hopkin's Treeves is never fully sated in how he feels about this dilemma, and so, neither can we be.Technically, The Elephant Man is a beautifully shot film. In crisp black and white, the film recalls the cinematic technique of American cinema circa the 1930's. The scenes dissolve into one another; there is no brisk editing. The lighting is kept low-key during dark scenes, balanced during daytime scenes-this is standard film-making of the era. The one digression from this form are the distinctly Lynchian surrealities-pseudo-dream-sequences of commendably original imagery that break up the film and serve as distinct mood-setters for the audience. These are, for the most part, fairly intimidating sidenotes. We as an audience are caught off-guard because in these tangents we are not identifying with Treeves, we are put instead into Merrick's shoes. It is unsettling.But Lynch has never been a director to flinch at unsettling prospects. We must watch Merrick beaten, abused, harassed, humiliated, and tormented. We may feel a surge of happiness when he finally stands up for himself, but by that point we still have to cope with what we've already, what he's already, experienced. I suppose that is the greatest and most devastating aspect of the film-empathy. Every moment is heartbreaking. Yet no matter how hard it gets, and how much better it then turns, there is always the threat of another jab. And those jabs only get more and more painful.The Elephant Man is a perfect film. It is sorrowful but it apologizes not at all for it. It is a film about where our empathy stems from, a film that asks you to feel sorry but rebukes you for your blind pity. It asks you to respect Merrick, not cry for him. But you can't help crying. The Elephant Man is a film that treks you through despair and asks for your hope in the end. It asks you to hate humanity but to love the humane. It asks you to look at a man who appears sad and know that inside, he's okay.

Yes, there is blood galore, but never is it gratuitous. Killing is not pretty. Guns have consequences. The dancing figure of a mobster being riddled by machine gun fire makes death a reality, not a glamorous event. The Coen Brothers reference the 1930's gangster films, especially Public Enemy and White Heat, as well as The Godfather. Their own twist is the element of a homosexual love triangle, the irony being that the most brutal and conscienceless mobsters are not heterosexual macho men. The issue of having a heart is raised again and again through the film, and the consequences of having one in such a brutal world provides another irony in this often sentimental, but honest look at man's greed, at man's essential lust for power. Only Verna has a heart and seems capable of love. Tom, too, has a heart, but his love for Verna can easily be dismissed as lust. However, he and Verna both have unswerving loyalty, loyalty that is assuredly misplaced, but loyalty nonetheless. The theme of family which is part of the gangster genre also has a postmodern twist here. There is the ludicrous family of Johnny Caspar, the sibling connection between Verna and Bernie, and the father-son relationship between Leo and Tom. This last verges on the homoerotic in the last scene. The haunting musical score is reminiscent of old movies, with Tom's theme, a melody played at the beginning, the end, and points between when Tom is on screen and in trouble. One is reminded of Tara's theme in Gone with the Wind. The dialogue is fast paced, so much so that even my students, normally highly acute when it comes to movies, found it difficult to follow on the first viewing. Actually, the subtlety of expression adds to this difficulty. Listen, for instance, to the clues to the fact that there is a gay love triangle. If you don't catch them, the plot makes little sense. The homosexuality is never overtly stated, nor are the comments about the gay relationship ever highlighted in any way. There is no use of words like faggot to finger the gay characters, but it is clear who they are if you're listening. This is a movie that has to be seen more than once. It itself, so referential to older gangster movies, has been referenced by more recent ones like Road to Perdition. To date, I think it is the best of Coen Brothers' movies and I like almost all of the others.

The issue of having a heart is raised again and again through the film, and the consequences of having one in such a brutal world provides another irony in this often sentimental, but honest look at man's greed, at man's essential lust for power. Only Verna has a heart and seems capable of love. Tom, too, has a heart, but his love for Verna can easily be dismissed as lust. However, he and Verna both have unswerving loyalty, loyalty that is assuredly misplaced, but loyalty nonetheless. The theme of family which is part of the gangster genre also has a postmodern twist here. There is the ludicrous family of Johnny Caspar, the sibling connection between Verna and Bernie, and the father-son relationship between Leo and Tom. This last verges on the homoerotic in the last scene. The haunting musical score is reminiscent of old movies, with Tom's theme, a melody played at the beginning, the end, and points between when Tom is on screen and in trouble. One is reminded of Tara's theme in Gone with the Wind. The dialogue is fast paced, so much so that even my students, normally highly acute when it comes to movies, found it difficult to follow on the first viewing. Actually, the subtlety of expression adds to this difficulty. Listen, for instance, to the clues to the fact that there is a gay love triangle. If you don't catch them, the plot makes little sense. The homosexuality is never overtly stated, nor are the comments about the gay relationship ever highlighted in any way. There is no use of words like faggot to finger the gay characters, but it is clear who they are if you're listening. This is a movie that has to be seen more than once. It itself, so referential to older gangster movies, has been referenced by more recent ones like Road to Perdition. To date, I think it is the best of Coen Brothers' movies and I like almost all of the others.

Yes, there is blood galore, but never is it gratuitous. Killing is not pretty. Guns have consequences. The dancing figure of a mobster being riddled by machine gun fire makes death a reality, not a glamorous event.

Starring a young (and pretty weird looking) Linda Blair as Regan, the unfortunate 12 year old who Satan decides to possess, Ellen Burstyn as her mother and Max von Sydow and Jason Miller as the priests who attempt to exorcise Regan's demons, the film has been called 'The Scariest Film of All Time'. I think that in 1973 it probably WAS the scariest film of all time. Unfortunately, as with so many films that hold any substantial amount of notoriety, the film has been so pervasive in pop culture that nothing is up for grabs as a surprise anymore for anyone who genuinely hasn't seen it. We know about the 360 degree head turn, the pea soup, the vulgarities spewed from the mouth of this little girl with a Mercedes McCambridge voice (probably one of the most frightening aspects of the film). What I was prepared to base my opinion on was the actual film. How did the film progress from one shocking scene to another? Unfortunately, I found that it is pretty weak. Friedkin's jump-cut scenes are almost as startling as anything else in the film. There are many things that go unexplained, or are at least barely weakly supported, (for example, why Regan ended up in the hospital going through testing in the first place; all she had said at that point that she had felt her bed shake) and plots that are built up go nowhere. (I'm still confused as to what the excavation in Iraq had to do at all with the end results) The acting is decent in The Exorcist; Burstyn is always good, and Blair is good enough to see that she was probably completely miserable for the duration of the filming. The version I saw was fortunately the director's cut, which featured the very effective 'spider walk' scene that Friedkin had removed for thirty years, and some really great flashes of what I kept calling the 'zombie face', which turned out to be extremely effective in terms of scare value. Every time there would be one of these 'subliminal' shots, you could hear people in the audience ask one another 'Whoa! Did you catch that?' The print was also stellar, which allowed us to see Friedkin's excellent lighting in this film.I caught the midnight showing at a locally owned theater on the eve of Halloween, and the crowds 'The Exorcist' drew is a testimony to its long-standing reputation and its inherent appeal, even thirty years later. While the film itself is just okay, and the actual 'horror' portions are almost passé in this day and age, the film should certainly be remembered for its impact thirty years ago, and in reality, because 'The Exorcist' raised the bar for horror films, the eventual emulation by future directors of horror films probably caused its own impact to be lessened. I also believe that once the dust cleared on the shock value, it is clear to see that the rest of the film is not as strong as it maybe should be. Still, the film is an important one, even with its shortcomings. 6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"6 November 2004","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" One of the films that nobody can believe I hadn't seen until recently is 'The Exorcist', William Friedkin's screen adaptation of William Peter Blatty's novel.

It's just an awful, boring script and it's no wonder that very few of the actors went on to any kind of a career in film. These people memorized their lines and started filming. There is no passion or emotion in any of the dialogue. I was reminded over and over again of the sequence of scenes in Reservoir Dogs where Tim Roth is urged to memorize, and then make his own, an anecdote about a drug deal. His mentoring police officer tells him that it's not enough to just memorize the story. He has to know all the little details. He has to make the story utterly believable.
