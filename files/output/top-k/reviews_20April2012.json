Second of all, if you're a fan of gangster movies, this movie is a must see one. It's right up there with The Godfather trilogy in terms of sheer scope, majesty and brilliance of storytelling. And yet the movies are very different. The Godfather is more about the mafia and old crime families whereas this movie is much more from rags to riches kind of story. And it is one that has influenced its genre greatly. Scorsese's Goodfellas for example owns a lot of its basic story, style and characters to this piece.Although in my opinion Goodfellas tells its story a bit better. Once Upon a Time in America is told in non-chronological fashion with many early scenes getting their background and explanation near the end of the film. The director's cut is the one where this non-chronological order is maintained as it was 'fixed' for the initial release in many places. I can understand the reasoning behind that decision as the movie is kind of hard to follow unless you pay a lot of attention or are willing to watch it twice, but it really takes something away from the vision if you mess with the director's initial ideas, so see the director's cut even if it requires a bit more from you as a viewer.That being said, the story has some ambiguity to it, which either works for you or not. For me, it kind of did. The movie has that epic feel to it, depending more on its themes, the atmosphere and the actors to relay its message of fighting your way through heavy odds, disregarding the rules of the society and making up your own rules, depending on your brothers and bowing down to no one. Classical gangster movie themes, but this film really solidifies them into their pure form.Special mentions should also go to the cast and the score, which were both beyond measure. Robert De Niro, Ennio Morricone, Joe Pesci, James Woods... How can you go wrong with people like that. They really took this movie and made it their own with perfectly delivered lines, atmospheric and highly memorable pieces of music and sheer talent.Still, I can't say that this movie deserves a higher grade than what I gave it. Its individual pieces are all about perfect, but the way that the story is told and the length of the film drag it down just the tiniest bit. I can respect the artistic vision behind those both aspects and I can clearly see why some regard this as their favourite movie of all time, but I personally prefer Goodfellas. It's a great movie, but not the greatest.

Classical gangster movie themes, but this film really solidifies them into their pure form.Special mentions should also go to the cast and the score, which were both beyond measure. Robert De Niro, Ennio Morricone, Joe Pesci, James Woods... How can you go wrong with people like that. They really took this movie and made it their own with perfectly delivered lines, atmospheric and highly memorable pieces of music and sheer talent.Still, I can't say that this movie deserves a higher grade than what I gave it. Its individual pieces are all about perfect, but the way that the story is told and the length of the film drag it down just the tiniest bit. I can respect the artistic vision behind those both aspects and I can clearly see why some regard this as their favourite movie of all time, but I personally prefer Goodfellas.

Second of all, if you're a fan of gangster movies, this movie is a must see one. It's right up there with The Godfather trilogy in terms of sheer scope, majesty and brilliance of storytelling. And yet the movies are very different. The Godfather is more about the mafia and old crime families whereas this movie is much more from rags to riches kind of story. And it is one that has influenced its genre greatly. Scorsese's Goodfellas for example owns a lot of its basic story, style and characters to this piece.Although in my opinion Goodfellas tells its story a bit better. Once Upon a Time in America is told in non-chronological fashion with many early scenes getting their background and explanation near the end of the film. The director's cut is the one where this non-chronological order is maintained as it was 'fixed' for the initial release in many places. I can understand the reasoning behind that decision as the movie is kind of hard to follow unless you pay a lot of attention or are willing to watch it twice, but it really takes something away from the vision if you mess with the director's initial ideas, so see the director's cut even if it requires a bit more from you as a viewer.That being said, the story has some ambiguity to it, which either works for you or not. For me, it kind of did.

Unfortunately the explosion was 15 or so years too early to prevent the escape of the Jersey Shore and Jerseylicious idiots, but you can't have everything.(Nothing to do with the plot but the actual explosion and subsequent fireworks is awesomely pulled off, I'm not sure if it was miniatures or 90s CGI, I only know I wished for a Blu-Ray instead of the DVD I rented.)

But it wasn't good for him.It was at this point &#x96; shortly after Jackie Brown by my reckoning &#x96; that QT ceased simply reading his own press and started writing it.Since then Tarantino does more press for his own films in the years before they come out than any other director, always gushing about other B movies, exploitation 'classics' and obscure foreign films, before effortlessly segueing back to 'and that's the thing with my new film, I'm bringing back South Korean carwash slashers from the 70s, only I'm using the backdrop of chimpanzee trainers in love'.It suddenly became less about how good the film was and more about the sources of inspiration and which 'now' actor was in it alongside the inevitable face that QT dragged in from the past.This is all well and good &#x96; unless you want me to start on about Death Proof and how Inglourious Basterds is an over-rated piece of crap &#x96; but Reservoir Dogs was pretty damning good before people could pronounce Tarantino, and compared to his more recent output it only looks better. Mr Brown. Mr White. Mr Orange. Mr Blue. Mr Blonde. Mr Pink. Six guys in black suits, white shirts and black ties. They have breakfast with grizzled old guy Joe and track suit wearing Eddie, holding rambling conversations talking about a variety of subjects in dialogue peppered with obscenities and refreshingly non-script sounding lines. They exit the diner and head on down the street side by side, chuckling all the way.They are heading to rob a jewelers. A robbery that goes horribly wrong, leaving innocent bystanders, criminals and police alike scattered dead in the streets.The bulk of the film deals with the aftermath of the robbery.I will leave the names aside, needless to say that the cover shows Tim Roth, Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi and Michael Madsen as headliners, they all play key roles. There are long intense scenes with heated dialogue while the survivors discuss the possibility of being set up, which is eminently possible given that none of the gents with 'colourful' names know each other, having all been teamed up for this one off job.This also means that none of the men spare any niceties or pull any punches in casting about their allegations and accusations, leading to fist fights and inevitably the drawing of handguns &#x96; we're in the US after all.The soundtrack music is exceptional and the sleepy drawl of fictional DJ K-Billy (Steven Wright) punctuates some quiet moments with amusing snippets usually preceding well chosen tracks.The camera work at the time was fresh and new &#x96; even if most of it was allegedly stolen from Asian filmmakers like John Woo &#x96; and the back and forth editing was a little disconcerting at first but undoubtedly exciting, far from the overdone device that it has since become, even by Mr Tarantino himself. (There is even a flashback within a flashback!) The acting is excellent, Roth, Buscemi and Madsen made instant names for themselves and Keitel did nothing to sully his all time great reputation, the minor roles were all well cast and equally well acted, which in a film light on for car chases and shootouts is quite important. Again it must be mentioned that this was before Tarantino started such indulgent sh*t like 'The 4th film by Quentin Tarantino', so everything is lean, mean and efficient, honed to a fine edge.The low budget nature of the film is rendered irrelevant by the plot which lends itself well to only a few sets and backdrops, and when the dialogue is as crackling as that on display here the lack of car chases and large explosions is hardly missed.I think it is fair &#x96; and obvious &#x96; of me to say that I think QT has more than just rested on his laurels since his early hungry days, but credit where credit is due, others have made Tarantino-esque stuff in the last 15 years, including QT himself, but no-one has managed to top Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction yet, and it's fine with me if they never do.Final Rating &#x96; 9 \/ 10. The older it gets the better it is. Reservoir Dogs is like an old song now, you know practically every line and there are no surprises, but when it is on the TV \/ radio you can't change the station.

Basically the Second World War has ended, and infantry platoon sergeant Al Stephenson (Oscar nominated Fredric March), decorated Army Air Forces captain and bombardier Fred Derry (Dana Andrews) and aircraft carrier airman Homer Parrish (Oscar winning, Honorary Oscar and Golden Globe Special Award winning Harold Russell) are returning home. Before the war, Al was a bank loan officer, and he is returning to his family, wife Milly (Myrna Loy) and the grown up children, daughter Peggy (Teresa Wright) and college freshman son Rob (Michael Hall), but it is obvious he is struggling to readjust to a normal life, and becoming alcoholic. Before the war, Fred was working in a drugstore as a soda jerk, this is the only job he can return to, and he has found out his wife Marie (Virginia Mayo), who he met and married in training before he left, is working as a nightclub waitress. Homer lost both his hands after they were severely burned, so he relies on mechanical hook prostheses, and he knows that his parents and fiancée Wilma Cameron (Cathy O'Donnell) are finding it hard to cope and deal with his disability. Peggy meets Fred and becomes attracted by him, and she becomes jealous towards him and Marie, even contemplating breaking them further apart, but father Al tells Fred to stop seeing her, and as a result the two mens' friendship is damaged. Fred then finds out that his wife Marie has been having an affair with another veteran, Cliff (Steve Cochran), and she admits to it saying that she wants a divorce, and with that he decides to leave town, leaving his father with parting gifts, but he does get a new job. Homer meanwhile doesn't want to burden Wilma with his hard life, and he bluntly demonstrates his need for help doing certain things, but she makes him believe she loves him anyway. They agree to get married, and Fred is the best man at the wedding, and Homer and Wilma are very happy, as are Fred and Peggy who embrace their feelings because of his divorce. Also starring Hoagy Carmichael as Butch Engle, Gladys George as Hortense Derry, Roman Bohnen as Pat Derry and Ray Collins as Mr. Milton. The cast all do their parts very well, with March as the character who suffers terrible wartime nightmares, and especially Russell whose real life disability makes his performance both moving and powerful. The direction by Wyler is suitable for the emotional and realistic story, the most compelling of the three men of the plot is of course the poor man who lost his hands, I will admit it could be shorter, it is almost three hours, but all in all it is a worthwhile drama. It won the Oscars for Best Film Editing, Best Music for Hugo Friedhofer, Best Writing, Screenplay and Best Picture, and it was nominated for Best Sound, it won the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source, and it won Golden Globe Best Motion Picture - Drama. It was number 37 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, it was number 11 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers, and it was number 6 on The Ultimate Film. Very good!

These are myths in the sense that they are the exclusive property of no individual author, but belong in common to the whole culture (as Murnau's subtitle, calling this a Volkssage, reminds us); and as such they are susceptible to wide variations in the telling. The tale of Faust began humbly enough (by literary standards) in the anonymous German *Faustbuch*, which, quickly translated into English, soon became the basis for one of Kit Marlowe's greatest plays. After that brief emergence into high culture it went low-brow again, becoming a staple of German puppet theater, and wall-paintings in beer-cellars like Auerbach's in Leipzig. Lessing saw its possibilities, and Goethe (who had drunk at Auerbach's as a student) realized them in the greatest work of German literature--on which he lavished much of a very long life. Goethe's work inspired Romantic artists including not only Byron (as in Manfred) but also opera composers ranging from Ludwig Spohr to Hector Berlioz, Charles Gounod, and Arrigo Boito.Murnau's splendid (and now splendidly restored) silent film takes its cues primarily from the Goethe and Gounod versions, but goes its own way too, as is quite right. Goethe, after all, was writing a closet drama, that is, a play meant to be read rather than performed and seen in a theater (though the first of its two parts is widely considered stage-able); but Murnau was creating a photo-play in which any words had to be in the form of disruptive title screens; and so the verbal component, which for Goethe was the whole, had in film to be kept to a bare minimum. This underlies and justifies many of Murnau's departures from Goethe's splendid precedent--departures that offended me when I first saw this film many years ago, in a far inferior version, but that I now see the reason and justification for. In any case, those of us who are familiar with Goethe's *Faust* (as Germans tend to be) are seeing a rather different movie here from the one that others see--for better and\/or for worse.From Goethe (himself borrowing from *Job*) this film takes the notion of a background wager between Heaven and Hell, here providing that if Faust falls, spiritually, Hell gets to rule the whole earth. This being a film from Germany a quarter of the way through the twentieth century (which Al Pacino, as the Devil in *Devil's Advocate,* memorably characterizes as all mine), the terms of the wager provide no sure clue which side will win it. The *Faustbuch,* Marlowe, and Berlioz all consign Faust to Hell at the end; Goethe, Gounod, and Boito all redeem him. What will this film do? Find out! The emphasis on youth (as the main desideratum for which Faust bargains with the devil), and the disproportionate (relative to Goethe) emphasis on the love story with Gretchen, both show influence from the Gounod opera. An example of Murnau's departing from both precedents is having Mephisto himself commit a murder that in both Goethe and Gounod he manipulates Faust into committing; but the underlying idea, that Mephisto is prepping Faust for Hell and damnation by leading him to despair of salvation, is rightly maintained. Also, where Goethe has Faust recall a plague when his and his father's medical science utterly failed to help people, Murnau makes that plague present, and Faust's inability to help is the immediate cause of his spiritual desperation. A maiden who appeals in vain to the aged Faust for medical help (for her mother) is a near look-alike to Gretchen, a nice touch.Jannings is a splendidly louche, unhandsome devil (here named Mephisto, the only name bestowed upon this character in actual dialog in Goethe, though speech prefixes give Mephistopheles). His tactics are ingeniously contrived to keep outright magic to a minimum, relying on spiritual cunning instead. Camilla Horn seems too much the stock silent heroine early on, but grows mightily as Gretchen suffers. Gösta Ekman as the title character is perhaps weaker in his young guise, but his ability (with great help from makeup) to represent both old Faust and young is breathtaking.Makeup in general is too stagy for the frequent sharply focused closeups, so that we see it AS makeup. For special effects, shots of the apocalyptic horsemen, and shots of Mephisto and Faust on the back of some rough beast supposedly carrying them through the sky, may induce some cringes; but otherwise the quality is astonishingly high for the period, with model sets exquisitely designed, built, dressed, and photographed. The soundtrack of the 1997 restored version features only one each of cello, trumpet, violin, clarinet, and piano, and so sounds a bit thin, and also rather repetitious, but it is enlivened by intelligent quotations from both Gounod's opera and Schubert's setting (from Goethe) of Gretchen am Spinnrade.

Veteran Muppet Frank Oz takes the helm from Jim Henson and makes a few minor but noticeable changes. Gone are the nods and winks to the audience for the most part, and the film is far more plot based and linear than the slapstick shenanigans of the first film.Kermit and the gang are finishing college and pondering their futures, which will very likely result in them all moving on separately and losing touch. However Kermit boldly concocts a plan that will see the gang remain together, by heading en masse to Manhattan to launch a massive stage musical called Manhattan Melodies, with all the Muppets as performers or stage hands.Unfortunately after just a few short days, no success and low on funds, the various characters are forced to disperse and forge their own future, with the promise from Kermit to summon them all if\/when the musical gets greenlit. Kermit takes a job in a diner and everyone goes their separate ways.In many ways this is a more depressing film than the first two &#x96; even with the frog killing theme &#x96; for long periods of time the characters mope and ponder a future alone, and it seems that the Muppets will never again operate in unison. Of course this isn't how the film ends, but even in a puppet movie you don't need to be kept sad for over half the running time.The jokes are less frequent and the tone less tongue in cheek. The cameos are still plentiful but are more 'look here's the famous cameo' than in other films. The inclusion of the Muppet Babies in a thinly veiled promo for the spin-off is as entertaining as it is blatant, and in some ways is a minor indictment on the dull tone of the rest of the film that it can be upstaged by a flashback.There is another attempt at a grand sequence with Piggy taking a skate through the park, but it is far less successful than either of the sequences from Caper, and the big finale was an apt but desperate ending to proceedings.Final Rating &#x96; 6.5 \/ 10. I by no means am saying steer clear of Manhattan, but after the Muppet Movie got the ball rolling and Caper took such a great leap forward, it is disappointing that the franchise would take a step back like this.

The inclusion of the Muppet Babies in a thinly veiled promo for the spin-off is as entertaining as it is blatant, and in some ways is a minor indictment on the dull tone of the rest of the film that it can be upstaged by a flashback.There is another attempt at a grand sequence with Piggy taking a skate through the park, but it is far less successful than either of the sequences from Caper, and the big finale was an apt but desperate ending to proceedings.Final Rating &#x96; 6.5 \/ 10.

This time it was the sequel, which generated an equal amount of movie bliss. Experiencing these two classic movies on the big screen almost 40 years after release reinforces what great films they are &#x85; and how few truly great films get made. We are reminded that a powerful well-written story, world class cast, visionary director, brilliant photographer and stunning composer are all necessary components for movie greatness.This sequel explores three time periods the journey of 9 year old Vito to the U.S., his rise to power in Little Italy, and Corleone life after Vito's death. Some find the cuts to varying timelines to be distracting. Personally, I find it fascinating and a very effective way to tell the entire story. Watching an almost mute 9 year old Vito land on Ellis Island and transform into a twenty-something community leader is one of the more powerful and unlikely events ever seen on screen. Mix that with Al Pacino holding little back as a power-mongering Michael is downright frightening. If you doubt this, look at it from the perspective of Diane Keaton's May, or John Cazale's Fredo.The film received 11 Oscar nominations and won 6, including Best Picture. Robert DeNiro won for his tremendous turn as young Vito. This is early DeNiro &#x85; the Mean Streets, Taxi Driver era. DeNiro and Marlon Brando remain the only two actors to have won Oscars for playing the same character. Two other acting nominations went to Lee Strasberg as Hyman Roth and Michael V Gazzo as Pentangeli. Mr. Strasberg was the famed acting teacher whose prized pupils included none other than Al Pacino (who talked him into taking this role). Strasberg was also bequeathed 75% of the Marilyn Monroe estate and there was much scandal after his death when his widow auctioned off most of it.A couple of other interesting points were that most of this script was original for the film, though the background story of Vito was drawn from Mario Puzo's novel. Director Francis Ford Coppola considered casting Joe Pesci as the young Clemenza, but ultimately decided on Bruno Kirby. Dominic Chianese plays Hyman Roth's right hand man Johnny Ola. Chianese has been recently seen in both The Sopranos and Boardwalk Empire. B-Movie mogul Roger Corman plays one of the Senators on the committee interrogating Michael and Pentangeli. Harry Dean Stanton plays one of the FBI bodyguards, and former heartthrob Troy Donahue plays Connie's (Talia Shire) goofy boyfriend Merle. One of my favorite characters in the film is Don Fanucci, robustly played by Gastone Moschin. His strutting and preening always creeps me out and makes me laugh.Besides being the first sequel to win a Best Picture Oscar, The Godfather II is simply one of the finest films ever made. At 200 minutes, it requires both a time and mental commitment, but along with The Godfather, Coppola and Puzo have provided us exemplary story telling through expert filmmaking.

It is dark, yet it shines a light on the social misfits of America, those embodying a person they are dissatisfied with, and those feeling worthless or unwanted. It is a tragedy in some sense, but it is also a very poignant satire on the modern American suburbia. If you're one of the many misfits in the world, American Beauty is your shoutout.The plot is defined by the film's abundance of interesting and versatile characters, almost all of them stuck in a life they do not want to live. Our lead character is Lester Burnham (Spacey) a forty-two year old magazine writer, entering a midlife crisis and occupying an incorruptible hatred for his job and the ignorance possessed by his wife Carolyn (Bening) and daughter Jane (Birch). I'll be dead in a year claims Lester in the first few moments of the film. In a way, I'm dead already he will go on to say.Tired of the trite and ordinary life he is living, he gets a curveball when he meets Jane's best friend Angela (Suvari), an unrealistically attractive teenager, promiscuous and blunt in her dialect and fashion. Lester is shamelessly smitten with her upon their first encounter, and Angela knows it all too well. She treasures the idea that other men fantasize about having sex with her, despite having no prior relationship or knowledge. She feels it will only assist her career as a model. Pay close attention to the scene in the gymnasium. It is rather detailed and cinematically intelligent.In the meantime, Carolyn, a real-estate agent, has begun her rebellion by flirting and dancing with her main competition. Buddy Kane (Gallagher), a self-righteous, cocky man who gives her what her husband can't; safety, comfort, relaxation, and sex. A lot of it. Lester's rebellion starts when he quits his job and takes about eight steps down to the world of a fry-cook at a fast food joint. Jane's story of rebellion involves Ricky (Bentley), her neighbor who continues to videotape their interactions and spy on her persistently. At first, she is irritated, but begins to see Ricky for what he really is worth. He admires beauty in the way we all should. He sees simplicity as a treasure and feels it is taken for granted far too much. His upbringing has been rather heavy with an abusive bigot for a father and an uninvolved caricature for a mother. Not only is Ricky a passionate humanist and realist, but an avid drug dealer and pot smoker. There is a great scene in the film where him and Lester cut loose and smoke a joint together. This is where Lester's tale of rebellion and lawlessness comes into play.Over the years, American Beauty has been interpreted a number of different ways by a number of different people. It's almost as if the film occupies too much ambiguity, but it's subtle and reclusive in its efforts, making the film seem so basic and linear. I believe it is not only a tale of rebellion, but a tale of life appreciation and a reiteration of the moral Carpe diem. Upon finishing the film, I was distinctly reminded of the quote from Ferris Bueller's Day Off Life moves pretty fast. You don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it. We are constantly rushed, hurried, and flustered everyday, we hardly appreciate the serene and intricate aspects life throws at us. Who has the time? we might ask ourselves. American Beauty shows us it's the most simplistic things in life that are worth appreciating. Like a paper bag floating aimlessly in the air because of a modest wind gust. There is yet another wonderful shot in the film where Ricky is shooting a video through Jane's window. Angela is seductively dancing to taunt and satisfy him, but the camera zooms past her and in on a reflection of Jane's sad, lonely face. Rarely can a film accompany beautiful loneliness, but somehow, director Sam Mendes did in an earnest way, without being cheeky or bombastic. It's so crafty and subtle you may have missed it.Another moral I can find is the isolation and imprisonment many of the characters feel. In one scene, very early in the film, we see Lester masturbating, enclosed in the shower. It's the brightest part of my day he states, but is it because he is providing himself with pleasure or because he's alone and safe? One shot I missed when watching the film was the scene where Lester's reflection in his computer screen looks as if he is imprisoned and sheltered from the real world. This is the part of American Beauty where it is keenly depressing. The three main emotions I felt during the film were happiness, depression, and vaguely present optimism. We already know the conclusion, but we can only hope we are wrong.American Beauty is exactly what it is. A beautiful, heartwarming drama, providing us with witty, affectionate characters, a slick script, and exquisite directing and cinematography (credited to the late Conrad L. Hall). It is a drama of integrity, appeal, intelligence, soul, and humanism. Why can't they all be this wonderful? Starring Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, Mena Suvari, Chris Cooper, and Allison Janney. Directed by Sam Mendes. ","genre":null},{"date":"20 April 2012","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" The moral and ethical simplicity of American Beauty is absolutely stunning seeing as it such a powerful and moving film. It is dark, yet it shines a light on the social misfits of America, those embodying a person they are dissatisfied with, and those feeling worthless or unwanted. It is a tragedy in some sense, but it is also a very poignant satire on the modern American suburbia. If you're one of the many misfits in the world, American Beauty is your shoutout.The plot is defined by the film's abundance of interesting and versatile characters, almost all of them stuck in a life they do not want to live. Our lead character is Lester Burnham (Spacey) a forty-two year old magazine writer, entering a midlife crisis and occupying an incorruptible hatred for his job and the ignorance possessed by his wife Carolyn (Bening) and daughter Jane (Birch). I'll be dead in a year claims Lester in the first few moments of the film. In a way, I'm dead already he will go on to say.Tired of the trite and ordinary life he is living, he gets a curveball when he meets Jane's best friend Angela (Suvari), an unrealistically attractive teenager, promiscuous and blunt in her dialect and fashion. Lester is shamelessly smitten with her upon their first encounter, and Angela knows it all too well. She treasures the idea that other men fantasize about having sex with her, despite having no prior relationship or knowledge. She feels it will only assist her career as a model. Pay close attention to the scene in the gymnasium. It is rather detailed and cinematically intelligent.In the meantime, Carolyn, a real-estate agent, has begun her rebellion by flirting and dancing with her main competition. Buddy Kane (Gallagher), a self-righteous, cocky man who gives her what her husband can't; safety, comfort, relaxation, and sex. A lot of it. Lester's rebellion starts when he quits his job and takes about eight steps down to the world of a fry-cook at a fast food joint. Jane's story of rebellion involves Ricky (Bentley), her neighbor who continues to videotape their interactions and spy on her persistently. At first, she is irritated, but begins to see Ricky for what he really is worth. He admires beauty in the way we all should. He sees simplicity as a treasure and feels it is taken for granted far too much. His upbringing has been rather heavy with an abusive bigot for a father and an uninvolved caricature for a mother. Not only is Ricky a passionate humanist and realist, but an avid drug dealer and pot smoker. There is a great scene in the film where him and Lester cut loose and smoke a joint together. This is where Lester's tale of rebellion and lawlessness comes into play.Over the years, American Beauty has been interpreted a number of different ways by a number of different people. It's almost as if the film occupies too much ambiguity, but it's subtle and reclusive in its efforts, making the film seem so basic and linear. I believe it is not only a tale of rebellion, but a tale of life appreciation and a reiteration of the moral Carpe diem. Upon finishing the film, I was distinctly reminded of the quote from Ferris Bueller's Day Off Life moves pretty fast. You don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.

This is The Paramedic.I don't see any deep messages here or even any great acting, but I do see a very well assembled series of incidents that hang together and illustrate a number of themes without being preachy. New York City is once again shown as a loony bin with more than its share of loony people, but I get the feeling that it's the same in every city, village and hamlet in a crazed America that is drugged out. Nick Cage is totally stressed out and feels guilt over having lost one person, but he represents all sorts of people in all sorts of professions who are looking for some sort of feelings of accomplishment in their lives.A very good movie well worth your time. Be prepared for some blood but it's not gratuitous and there's plenty of comic relief. The latter virtually sets the mood of the film.Scorcese did a great job putting this one together.

The character animation is superb; it's no wonder why so many of today's top animators cite this as being among their favourite films. The laid-back, episodic nature of the story (far removed from Kipling's highly strung original, which Disney actually advised his staff NOT to read) allows for some delightfully entertaining scenes; the encounters with King Louie and the Liverpudlian vultures spring to mind. The characters also have a certain warmth about them that hasn't been seen in many Disney films before or since. The score is equally wonderful, and a good number of the songs - I Wanna Be Like You and The Bare Necessities in particular - have become standards.Having said that, I can't help but find The Jungle Book to be rather slight, and perhaps even overrated. As far as I'm concerned, the aforementioned individual elements seem better than the film as a whole. In particular, the lack of structure is as much a curse as it is a blessing; for every engaging scene or two, there can be a truly boring scene. Regardless of these inferior aspects, The Jungle Book is a good film that rightly deserves the label of Disney classic.
