In another part of the world another of the Ryan brothers is killed in action, leaving their mother with one remaining son and three telegrams due to be delivered.  A group of men, led by Captain Miller set out to reach Private Ryan and not only break him the news but to safely return him for return to the US.What can I say &#150; it is an excellent film despite some minor flaws.  The plot is based on a real life situation during WW2 and allows for us to follow a group of men as they take part in the horrors (and humanity) of war.  This is the film's strength and it is never stronger than in the first 25 minutes and, to a lesser extent, the final 20 minutes.  The opening of the Normandy landing is simply pure emotional power and is really well done &#150; it is so powerful that the actual plot itself is a bit of a letdown.  I love Band of Brothers because the focus was on the war and what it was like to be involved rather than a sort of soap opera story.  Here the plot is still very good but can't really follow that opening.It also sinks into sentiment a tad too often.  For example Ryan's mother lives in this sort of Norman Rockwell painting that is Spielberg's vision of middle America.  Also there is a little too much use of gawkish dialogue as well &#150; although it's hard to criticise the death scenes for being emotional, because they should be.A minor flaw that is easy to get over is the lack of Brits.  Like Band of Brothers (which had a few cockney accents) this is an AMERICAN film &#150; so of course they will focus on the American experience.  However it would have been nice to have some British (or any other) voices or faces among the Allies.  I can understand why the film opens and closes with the stars and stripes and why the film focuses on the yanks but a little bit of perspective would be useful.  There's nothing wrong with focus &#150; but when it totally excludes huge bits of information then it's a problem.  It always makes me think of the way that Michael Caine took his children back to the UK when they were taught in an US school that WW2 started in the 1940's (ie &#150; when America joined).However this is a minor flaw as, in fairness, it's an American film &#150; why be surprised when it's focus is Americans!  Of the cast Hanks is good &#150; he is much more subtle than his Oscar roles where he played to the crowd.  He benefits from having a great support cast of good actors, current actors, old faces, up and comers etc.  Sizemore, Burns and Farina are the good current actors.  Damon, Ribsi, Diesel, Martini etc are all very good on the way up &#150; although Damon has one of the simplest characters.  They may all be slight stereotypes of Americans but it's not a major flaw &#150; just a screen writer wanting to cover all bases I think, although it does grate that they cover all these backgrounds but can't squeeze any other Allies in to the edges.Overall it is excellent despite some stereotyping, US flag waving and the usual Spielberg love of sentimentality.  Even if the actual plot is flimsy Spielberg expertly puts us as close to experiencing the horrors and the humanity within war as I hope we'll ever be.

","genre":"Action, Drama, War"},{"date":"11 September 2002","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  What can you say about faith and Cinema? Its not like the domain is new from the Cinema standpoint. The lilting ring of 'May the force be with you' might justifiably be considered as one of the reasons why Star Wars is STAR WARS. 'The Excorcist' wouldn't be half as good if, in the end, the devil won. Or what about superheroes? Gotham wouldn't have a peaceful night without Batman, because superheroes are but demigods. For decades now, cinema has fashioned its offerings in a way that has perpetually comforted our faith & beliefs & given them a polished second voice. But the question always is how good has the point been driven? If the patterns of a chunk of cinematic offerings are similar, then how exactly do you rate a film from another? That is where the story and the storyteller come into play. M. Night Shyamalan is a gem of a storyteller and Signs is one gem of a film. The genius of Shyamalan gives new identity to the thriller, as he steers clear of conventional generic perceptions. No matter what aspect of Signs you explore, you'd be convinced that Shyamalan belongs right up there with the likes of Spielberg, Kazan, Coppola & Hitchcock.Signs is the story of Father Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) who loses his faith when his wife dies in a freak accident, leaving the task of bringing up their two children to Graham and his younger brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix). Six months later the household wakes up to find mysterious crop circles in their fields. As the family comes to terms with this incident, it gradually becomes apparent that these signs have been made by extra terrestrials and the world is on the brink of alien domination. Apart from battling for the safety of his family Graham experiences a deeper turmoil - Is faith really the solution to his fears?All those who expect the film to be an 'aliens vs mankind' showdown, would be disappointed. Indeed, 'Signs' is not 'Independence Day' revisited in an albeit domestic and scaled down avatar. But that does not stop 'Signs' from being the riveting classic that it is. The film is fulfilling in every aspect of film-making. The performances are top-notch and strong. Mel Gibson, as the widower responsible for two children and a brother, delivers magnificently in a role that couldn't be less in league with his action-hero image. In fact he revels astonishingly in some of the poignant scenes of the film. Joaquin Phoenix follows up his turn in 'Gladiator' with another constrained performance and reveals a genuine comic talent. Once again, Shyamalan extracts remarkable performances from child actors. Rory Culkin is terrific as Morgan and looking at Abigail Breslin, you'd hardly believe that she's 'acting'. The musical score of James Newton Howard goes in perfect sync with the film's moods. Shyamalan's direction retains the edginess he's become famous for, and the pace of the film is unpredictable & never complacent.

Its not like the domain is new from the Cinema standpoint. The lilting ring of 'May the force be with you' might justifiably be considered as one of the reasons why Star Wars is STAR WARS. 'The Excorcist' wouldn't be half as good if, in the end, the devil won. Or what about superheroes? Gotham wouldn't have a peaceful night without Batman, because superheroes are but demigods. For decades now, cinema has fashioned its offerings in a way that has perpetually comforted our faith & beliefs & given them a polished second voice. But the question always is how good has the point been driven? If the patterns of a chunk of cinematic offerings are similar, then how exactly do you rate a film from another? That is where the story and the storyteller come into play. M. Night Shyamalan is a gem of a storyteller and Signs is one gem of a film. The genius of Shyamalan gives new identity to the thriller, as he steers clear of conventional generic perceptions. No matter what aspect of Signs you explore, you'd be convinced that Shyamalan belongs right up there with the likes of Spielberg, Kazan, Coppola & Hitchcock.Signs is the story of Father Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) who loses his faith when his wife dies in a freak accident, leaving the task of bringing up their two children to Graham and his younger brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix). Six months later the household wakes up to find mysterious crop circles in their fields. As the family comes to terms with this incident, it gradually becomes apparent that these signs have been made by extra terrestrials and the world is on the brink of alien domination. Apart from battling for the safety of his family Graham experiences a deeper turmoil - Is faith really the solution to his fears?All those who expect the film to be an 'aliens vs mankind' showdown, would be disappointed. Indeed, 'Signs' is not 'Independence Day' revisited in an albeit domestic and scaled down avatar. But that does not stop 'Signs' from being the riveting classic that it is. The film is fulfilling in every aspect of film-making. The performances are top-notch and strong. Mel Gibson, as the widower responsible for two children and a brother, delivers magnificently in a role that couldn't be less in league with his action-hero image. In fact he revels astonishingly in some of the poignant scenes of the film. Joaquin Phoenix follows up his turn in 'Gladiator' with another constrained performance and reveals a genuine comic talent. Once again, Shyamalan extracts remarkable performances from child actors. Rory Culkin is terrific as Morgan and looking at Abigail Breslin, you'd hardly believe that she's 'acting'. The musical score of James Newton Howard goes in perfect sync with the film's moods. Shyamalan's direction retains the edginess he's become famous for, and the pace of the film is unpredictable & never complacent.

Being a fan of Ms. Rice's novels, my first thought was how can they do Queen Of The Damned without doing Vampire Lestat first?Having finally seen the movie, now I can see how they did it.  If you have read these books, imagine taking out the gory parts from Vampire Lestat, cramming Marcus and Marius into one character, and removing everything to do with Lestat's beginning (the wolf hunt, his violin playing, the Theatre Of The Vampires, and also Louis, Claudia, and Gabrielle), then in the last 15 minutes cramming in Queen Of The Damned.What we loose is a very important piece of Lestat's character.  His inner agony of having to kill to live, the fact that he carefully tries to select killers as his victims, and his love-hate relationship with Louis, Armand, Gabrielle, and all the other vampires.Also important to the story is that we loose the Story Of The Twins, which is the Genesis of Ms. Rice's vampires.  And while I am sure the cannibalism was to intense for showing on the screen, they could have done something closer, and showed us more of ancient Egypt.Even worse, we have this love interest thrown in between Jessie and Lestat.  The Vampire Chronicles is basically an American Yoni story.  For those that do not know, Yoni is another form of Hentai (Japanese Porn Comics).  But in Yoni, it is about gay male relationships, told by a female.  While I am sure many men object to the gayness of the characters, in this movie they went to the far extreme the opposite way.  For instead of Lestat persueing killers, he goes after young female groupies.And the other flaws in logic and storyline are vast.  At the beginning Lestat emerges from a century long sleep, then later on asks Marius how he made it through the 1950's in red velvet.  Marius has no idea who Elvis is, and says he slept through that period.  Makes you wonder how Lestat knows about 50's fashion and music, since he slept through the same time period himself.  And nothing is ever even mentioned about Louis, Claudia, or Gabrielle.  I think that is a huge shame.  Is like seeing Snow White and the 3 Dwarfs.Overall, the movie I thought was really bad.  About the only good thing about it was the soundtrack.  Most of the acting was poor, the accents drove me up the wall, and all of the really in-depth parts of the book were removed, leaving us only with a hollow shell, kind of like Enkil after he was sucked dry.If you want to see a good modern vampire movie, get Lost Boys, the original Interview With A Vampire, or even some old episodes of Dark Shadows.  Let this one Rest In Piece, with a stake through the heart, cloves of garlic around the neck, and a vial of Holy Water in the mouth.In ending, remember that before Aaliyah was killed, this was intended to go straight to video, no theatrical release was planned.  It is obvious now why this was.  It is only sad that somebody as talented as she will be remembered for this dog of a movie, instead of something where she really might have shined.I rate this a 2 on a scale of 1-10.

This is a poignant movie to the end that its occasional attempts at humor feel very out of place (They are usually just slight jabs at obesity) amid the serious commentary.  The *real* humor is seeing how confused Hal gets when everyone acts weird around the girls he's associating with, and even this is a smart comment on the film's maxim, Beauty is in the Eye of the Beholder.  Even better news is that there is very little vulgarity to sit through, and the film is delightfully shocking (One scene will likely evoke tears.) in its bold approach to a subject matter that Hollywood is generally reluctant to address.  The only real flagging is toward the end, where marriage is brought into the story unrealistically and needlessly.  Overall, this is a spectacular effort that has a lot to say.

Shallow Hal is a comment on these ideas, particularly in the realm of social betterment, as most of the unattractive people are the ones doing volunteer work at the hospital, joining the Peace Corps and helping out their sick grandmothers.  This is a poignant movie to the end that its occasional attempts at humor feel very out of place (They are usually just slight jabs at obesity) amid the serious commentary.  The *real* humor is seeing how confused Hal gets when everyone acts weird around the girls he's associating with, and even this is a smart comment on the film's maxim, Beauty is in the Eye of the Beholder.  Even better news is that there is very little vulgarity to sit through, and the film is delightfully shocking (One scene will likely evoke tears.) in its bold approach to a subject matter that Hollywood is generally reluctant to address.  The only real flagging is toward the end, where marriage is brought into the story unrealistically and needlessly.  Overall, this is a spectacular effort that has a lot to say.  Don't be fooled, though-- It's not a comedy- just a feel-good kind of movie that will probably open your eyes to the power of perception.

M. Night Shyamalan is one of the most amazing cinema storytellers, he has grown to become one of my favorite writer\/director in recent years. His latest dramatic sci-fi thriller `SIGNS' has proven that Mr. Night can create so much with so little. `SIGNS' tells a basic `alien invasion story', but M. Night is NOT going to show us 20 different flying space ships blowing things up here and there, instead he is going to put us inside a family home with characters that are suffering real emotions to those that the audience can relate to. The suspense is well balanced with the comedic and dramatic side of the story. The most amazing thing about this film is how M. Night has us (the audience) paying attention to every little detail and how we are deeply seeing something when there is nothing to see, the suspense scenes don't reveal the horror right in our faces but rather in our minds. The director leaves a shot long enough for us to imagine the unthinkable by providing sounds of what we can NOT see. `SIGNS' is not a film about crop circles nor aliens; that is just a background to what the real meaning of the plot is, which in an M. NIGHT style it builds up to an answer revealed at the end of the film. This is my #1 film for 2002. And to conclude I recommend seeing this film in theatres since the sound FX's and soundtrack will compliment your viewing.

Not to take too much away from the film, i still think it was groundbreaking and probably underappreciated but you can't help but wish there was more to it.

The movie is anything but that.  This is a skillful and very tongue-in-cheek parody of gangster films of the 1930's and 1940's and has about as much to do with reality as a Busby Berkeley musical.  Gabriel Byrne, Albert Finney, Marcia Gay Harden and the rest of the cast all keep a straight face during the proceedings and the outcome is highly entertaining.  The Coen brothers style here is very similar to their later hit movie Fargo and it's artistically miles past Blood Simple or any of their previous films.    As far as diverging from reality, in one scene Albert Finney fires his machine gun for five minutes without reloading (that's about 10,000 rounds, folks). Gabriel Byrne gets violently beat up every five minutes (this includes kicks to the face, being thrown down multiple flights of stairs etc.) and never shows anything more than a minor fat lip on his never-changing expression.  The gangsters are all dressed to kill and their dialogue is straight from Farewell, My Lovely.  When one gangster asks another if he's going to have a rival killed, he answers Yeah. For starters.  The movie has more intentional funny one-liners and equally hilarious scenes than the average comedy.  Of special note are the exchanges between Gabriel Byrne's character and the crooked Police Chief. If the movie Johnny Dangerously had dialogue like this, it would have been a box office sensation.     Most of the people who saw this movie when it came out in 1990 couldn't figure out exactly what they had just seen.  The Coens deliberately interspaced scenes of deadly earnestness between the put-ons and many viewers left theatres shaking their heads.  Now that most folks are more familiar with the Coens and their unique blend of macabre humor and real life tragedy, this film will make perfect sense on second viewing.  This is certainly one-of-a-kind film making at its best.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"11 September 2002","score":"7 out of 10 people found the following review useful","review":"  Set in the volatile political climate of Ecuador, 'Proof of Life' is basically a film about an engineer, Peter Bowman (David Morse, The Rock, The Negotiator) who is kidnapped by a ruthless gang of guerrillas. Enter former SAS man, Terry Thorne (Russell Crowe), a specialist in K&R (kidnap and ransom) to negotiate the terms of his release, whilst comforting and gaining the trust of Bowman's wife Alice (Meg Ryan). The ransom demands are extreme, and as Bowman and his company are uninsured it comes down to the family and Alice to provide the money, except they do not have the requisite amount, being able to accrue a mere $650 000.This is a long and rambling film that fails on almost every level. Considering that Ryan and Crowe were having a sizzling and passionate romance, it is incredible that none of this is transferred to screen. Their chemistry is simply none existent, and although the film moves throughout at a horribly boorish pace, their inevitable romance seems contrived, hurried and without any foundation whatsoever. Prolonged eye contact does not suddenly equate to earth shattering, deep, romantic love. Crowe is an undoubted talent with tremendous and markedly different performances in films like 'Gladiator', 'The Insider' and 'LA Confidential'. There is no doubt that action films suit his acting style, and Crowe can pull off a good performance even when he is given very little to play with. 'Proof of Life' is supposed to demonstrate his more sensitive side, whilst maintaining the rugged charm and hardness that has made him successful, but this is without doubt his worst film to date.Meg Ryan, seems to have built her career out of one film ('When Harry Met Sally') and more importantly one scene (the faked orgasm scene), and she is frankly awful in this film. She seems to be typecast, forever playing an emotional and tearful woman, and in 'Proof of Life' she is no different. Such repeated sentimentality in her characters make her performances much less effective than they might be in isolation, so when the tears come in this film, they are much less potent or moving than they ought to be.'Proof of Life' is completely lifeless, and the only scene that saves it is towards the end where the film gets some 'Predator' like action scenes, and we realise why we have come to watch Crowe, viz. to see him fire his gun. The star of the film is Thorne's close friend, and fellow K&R specialist, Dino (David Caruso, 'NYPD Blue'), but he is in too few scenes to really save the film.The premise of the film is a good one, as kidnapping has gone up massively throughout the world in the last ten years, especially in England, but there is so little that can be said that is positive about the film, although the ever reliable David Morse plays his hostage role particularly well. The usually sound Pamela Reed ('Kindergarten Cop'), plays Bowman's older sister, but her character could easily have been left out of the film altogether. In one scene she leaves for the airport to collect the ransom money and we never see or hear from her again.Director Taylor Hackford ('Devil's Advocate') can do a lot better than this, although I am sure that the film will be a box-office success simply because Crowe is one of Hollywood's biggest actors, despite the fact that it is dull and unentertaining.Overall 2\/10  ","genre":null},{"date":"11 September 2002","score":"7 out of 10 people found the following review useful","review":"  Set in the volatile political climate of Ecuador, 'Proof of Life' is basically a film about an engineer, Peter Bowman (David Morse, The Rock, The Negotiator) who is kidnapped by a ruthless gang of guerrillas.
