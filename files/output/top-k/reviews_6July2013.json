The movie enlightens those petty things that makes man and woman drift apart after marriage. And it also brings in notice how deep a woman's heart is, how much care and love it needs and how it could suppress it's need and feelings for the love of her family. Amazing acting by Diane Lane; the sensuality, the urge for love, for not being able to restrain yourself from doing something as it fulfills your desires, all what her role demanded, she gave it to the full. Overall, she depicted a woman who is in need of love, who has her desires unfulfilled and is in a dilemma of choosing between her family and her desires. But unfortunately, it was only her who kept the movie going otherwise the movie had nothing much special in it.My movie ratings are on following basis each having 2 stars1. Plot .5\/2 The starting was good but after a while it was quite lost. The movie could have been given a different route and surely a different ending. The issue they took on; gave to it a very unrealistic end. They could have shown much more.2. Cast&Crew 2\/2 All were at their best. Hats off to Diane Lane. And after seeing Olivier Martinez, one thing I came to know about is ladies love guys speaking English with a French accent hehe... 3. Imagination 1.5\/2 as I said, the petty things that breaks up a marriage and the unspoken desires of a woman very well thought. Half a star deducted for not thinking about a better story.4. Cinematography 1.5\/2 one thing I really liked is that the movie is all shot out in a cloudy and rainy atmosphere which perfectly goes with the story and also the music. But because of a poor plot, cinematographer's work could not get much of attention. 5.How much it satisfied its genre 1.5\/2 romance-full, drama-yes as the movie if full of feelings like desires, lust, love and revenge. There was not really any thriller in there. So overall rating- 7THANKS ","genre":null},{"date":"6 July 2013","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" The movie revolves around an issue which is one of the major reason of many divorces happening these days.
