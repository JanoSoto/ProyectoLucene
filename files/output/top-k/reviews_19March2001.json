But what of the man himself?  His passions, his loves?  The humanness behind the genius?  `Immortal Beloved,' written and directed by Bernard Rose, examines the man behind the music in a dramatization focusing on the mystery behind a letter-- written by Beethoven-- found among his effects after his death in 1827.  The letter bears no name or address, but was written to a woman to whom he refers as his `immortal beloved,' with nary a clue as to her identity.  But in his final will, it is she to whom he bequeaths his estate, and it therefore falls to Beethoven's secretary, Anton Schindler (Jeroen Krabbe), to unravel the mystery and discover her identity.  And as Schindler pursues his quest, a portrait of Beethoven, in his most human aspect, emerges. \tReminiscent of the approach taken by Orson Welles with `Citizen Kane,' Rose presents a riveting study of the enigmatic genius that was Beethoven.  He suggests a man driven by passion and ego, who was under appreciated during his lifetime (as great artists often are), and who grew bitter in the wake of the slings and arrows fate so surreptitiously hurled at him.  The great irony of his life, of course, was the deafness that deprived him of the aural beauty of his own creation, an affliction Rose implies was brought about through the brutality of a drunken father who would beat his son about the head and ears (And in retrospect, what a testimony to his genius, that he could write such music in his head without ever hearing an actual note). \tAs Beethoven, Gary Oldman gives an outstanding performance, one for which he should have received acclaim that somehow was never forthcoming.  His ability to create a total character, with such incredible emotional depth as he does here, is astounding.  It's puzzling as to why so many of his performances are overlooked, especially at Oscar time.  Besides this film, consider his work in `Sid and Nancy,' or more recently in `The Contender.'  He is simply a tremendous actor who has yet to have his day in the sun.  As Beethoven, he so completely immerses himself in the character that his soul is veritably reflected in his eyes.  You feel the silent world in which he was confined for most of his life, and it allows you to identify with the inner turmoil with which he had to cope and endure without respite.  Most importantly, Oldman makes you feel that unabashed passion that motivated and drove Beethoven on.  It's quite simply a remarkable performance.  Turning in notable performances as well are Isabella Rossellini, as Anna Marie Erdody, one of the women in Beethoven's life who may or may not have been the one to whom the letter was intended, and Johanna ter Steege, as Johanna, Beethoven's sister-in-law and the mother of his beloved nephew, Karl (Marco Hofschneider).   \tThe supporting cast includes Miriam Margolyes (Nanette), Barry Humphries (Clemens), Valeria Golino (Giulietta), Gerard Horan (Nikolaus), Christopher Fulford (Casper), Alexandra Pigg (Therese) and Luigi Diberti (Franz).  Beethoven's renown today, of course, exceeds even mythological proportions, which often facilitates the blending of fiction with fact.  But with `Immortal Beloved,' whether or not the finer points are historically accurate or not is of little consequence, for at it's heart this is a love story that is engrossing drama that is altogether transporting.  It's a memorable film, highlighted by Oldman's performance and, of course, the music.  And there are a number of scenes, as well, that are unforgettable and demand mention.  One depicting the debut performance of the `Ode to Joy,' and another in which the young Beethoven (played by Leo Faulkner) runs at night through the streets of the city to escape his drunken father (Fintan McKeown), coming at last to a lake, into which he wades to float on his back; and with the camera positioned directly above, looking down upon him, a billion stars are reflected in the water around him.  Then slowly the camera pulls back until the young Ludwig blends with the reflected stars to seemingly take his place among all the brightest lights of the firmament.  It's a scene that will leave you breathless and remain etched in your memory forever.

The great irony of his life, of course, was the deafness that deprived him of the aural beauty of his own creation, an affliction Rose implies was brought about through the brutality of a drunken father who would beat his son about the head and ears (And in retrospect, what a testimony to his genius, that he could write such music in his head without ever hearing an actual note). \tAs Beethoven, Gary Oldman gives an outstanding performance, one for which he should have received acclaim that somehow was never forthcoming.  His ability to create a total character, with such incredible emotional depth as he does here, is astounding.  It's puzzling as to why so many of his performances are overlooked, especially at Oscar time.  Besides this film, consider his work in `Sid and Nancy,' or more recently in `The Contender.'  He is simply a tremendous actor who has yet to have his day in the sun.  As Beethoven, he so completely immerses himself in the character that his soul is veritably reflected in his eyes.  You feel the silent world in which he was confined for most of his life, and it allows you to identify with the inner turmoil with which he had to cope and endure without respite.  Most importantly, Oldman makes you feel that unabashed passion that motivated and drove Beethoven on.  It's quite simply a remarkable performance.  Turning in notable performances as well are Isabella Rossellini, as Anna Marie Erdody, one of the women in Beethoven's life who may or may not have been the one to whom the letter was intended, and Johanna ter Steege, as Johanna, Beethoven's sister-in-law and the mother of his beloved nephew, Karl (Marco Hofschneider).   \tThe supporting cast includes Miriam Margolyes (Nanette), Barry Humphries (Clemens), Valeria Golino (Giulietta), Gerard Horan (Nikolaus), Christopher Fulford (Casper), Alexandra Pigg (Therese) and Luigi Diberti (Franz).  Beethoven's renown today, of course, exceeds even mythological proportions, which often facilitates the blending of fiction with fact.  But with `Immortal Beloved,' whether or not the finer points are historically accurate or not is of little consequence, for at it's heart this is a love story that is engrossing drama that is altogether transporting.  It's a memorable film, highlighted by Oldman's performance and, of course, the music.  And there are a number of scenes, as well, that are unforgettable and demand mention.  One depicting the debut performance of the `Ode to Joy,' and another in which the young Beethoven (played by Leo Faulkner) runs at night through the streets of the city to escape his drunken father (Fintan McKeown), coming at last to a lake, into which he wades to float on his back; and with the camera positioned directly above, looking down upon him, a billion stars are reflected in the water around him.  Then slowly the camera pulls back until the young Ludwig blends with the reflected stars to seemingly take his place among all the brightest lights of the firmament.  It's a scene that will leave you breathless and remain etched in your memory forever.  And it's but one of the more astounding moments from an astounding motion picture that absolutely must not be missed.  I rate this one 10\/10.

I like Gillian Anderson movies, and I enjoy watching her on screen, but I couldn't say either of those things about this particular one.  The House of Mirth is a period piece, set in 1905 and involves a nauseating amount of characters, all with a different personal agenda, and all with different cards to play. But while there are several characters, the plot basically revolves around Lily Bart (Gillian Anderson), a well to do, good looking woman.  There aren't many things worse in the world than a woman who knows how good looking she is, and she does, and she uses it to her advantage.  Lily gets away with things that other women can't, until it eventually catches up with her.  She loses her money and her good name because of few little indiscretions, and is left with some decisions to make.  She must decide how to play her cards, knowing that they will affect her life and the lives of several of the other players.I'll be the first to admit that this is a rather brief and strange plot summary of the movie, but I just can't see it any other way.  Some might characterize this as the love that was never meant to be, as seen in Shakespeare in Love, and others might see the attempts of a woman to control her own destiny, as in Dangerous Beauty.  I'll admit that I saw aspects of both of those movies here, but I really saw a movie about one woman deciding if she wants to destroy the lives of others just to raise her own.  I looked at this as more of a poker game of life rather than a love story, and perhaps that might explain why I wasn't as impressed as many of the other critics who saw this.  As far as the rest of the movie goes, nothing really stands out.  The acting is decent, and the writing was fairly good, but I did have one glaring problem to report about both.  When dealing with period based movies, there has to be a line drawn between representing things as they were, and representing things that can be understood by today's society.  Shakespeare in Love did an excellent job in drawing that line as to highlight the best of both worlds.  The dialogue and accents in that movie weren't 100% Shakespearean, but it helped relate things to the current audiences that wouldn't understand it if it were.  The House of Mirth didn't draw that line so well.  I've no doubt that this is a very accurate picture of what society must have been like during the early 1900's, but that doesn't mean I could follow it.  The dialogue and accents here are good, but it's really quite hard to follow the plot and innuendos of the characters when they aren't speaking the same language as you do.  In those regards, Terence Davies, the writer and director, failed miserably.  I guess you could look at it in the perspective of such other movies as the Insider or Traffic.  Both of those movies went for the real heart of what they were showing, the critics loved them, the Oscar Committees nominated them, but they were a bit hard to watch at times.  They focused more on the content and making them original, rather than making the movie enjoyable for the masses, and they aren't very entertaining movies as a result.

Luckily for us, The Yards has now, after numerous attempts, at last found a slot in our busy cinema programme. It might not be an extreme case, but no print of The Yards had hitherto made it to Luxembourg's screens, despite plenty of advertising. Now it is on, though, and it was well worth the wait.The film concentrates on ex-convict Leo (Mark Wahlberg), a pretty dumb (`I'm not too good with words') but normal member of the Handler family, a family that includes his longtime friend Willie Gutierrez (Joaquin Phoenix), cousin Erica (Charlize Theron) and corrupt Uncle Frank (James Caan), the latter being head of the company that controls most of the NY railways. After a botched sabotage at the railway sidings (`the Yards') in Queens, Leo takes the brunt for his friends' failure and gets into serious trouble with the police. And, at the same time, he is in the middle of a love triangle too.The Yards really is nothing more than a genre film &#150; that is, if you want to call the mafia-film an established genre. The basic scenario is not far removed from any of the luminary films of the mafia genre. There are elements of The Godfather, of course, and like all these films, the story is one of a whole family caught up in the dirty business of, no, not narcotics or booze, but the slightly less illustrious world of control over the New York subway. And plenty of people get ` whacked'.Writer-director James Gray, whose only previous directing credit is for hitman-portrayal Little Odessa, has assembled one of the best cast lists you'll have seen for ages. `Marky Mark' Wahlberg is for once not overshadowed by his fellow actors or by computer-generated gadgetry. He is perfect in the role of the innocent-looking ex-convict and, considering his surroundings, relative softie. True, he sports just one expression for the entire running-time of the film, but it is a convincing one.

After ho hum success with KEEPING THE FAITH and MYSTERY MEN, Ben tackles love again for the first time since THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY and produces a tremendous hit. And bravo to not only Ben, but every actor involved too. The acting effort from everyone is perfectly done to create a well done comedy. So well done you might even miss some of the flaws. MEET THE PARENTS is far more subtler than MARY in dumb gross out gags, but that is what makes this movie far more appealing. MEET THE PARENTS is shorter, doesn't require you to check your brain on the shelf and uses some of the basic comedy gags perfectly. Mind you some of them don't work well (to be discussed later), but to keep the story moving, MEET THE PARENTS wins deservedly the praise people give it.Greg is ready to propose to his girl friend Pam. A badly timed phone call reveals though that it is better for Greg to get the approval of her parents first, especially her father, Jack (played extremely well by Robert De Niro). Can Greg win Jack 's approval and get in 'the circle of trust?'Some comedy moments are a little too predictable and will have plenty of the film buffs' eyes roll. The perfect example is the fate of the altar, even the fate of the cat seemed a bit too obvious. Why it succeeds is how it happens. Poor Greg tries a bit too hard in every category and the fate of our favorite loser is what makes this movie great. When he is around, something bad will happen! During the 'car chase' scene, nothing was more hilarious than the look of Greg's eyes while looking at Jack. It seemed as if they were bulging out of his face! After tragedy strikes the altar and everyone comes outside to look, Greg's lunge into the house is too comical but perfect timing. The one character who seemed out of place though was Kevin, Pam's ex boyfriend. Whether he was really necessary or not is the main question. Not that Owen Wilson played the role badly, he was great too, but you could have put any single, rich neighbor that is about Pam 's age and Greg would still be jealous. It would have saved the movie from dumb lines like, Oh, our relationship was just, you know, physical. Save from some of the predictable scenes and the dragging, unnecessary at times dialogue, MEET THE PARENTS is a great light hearted comedy that everyone will enjoy at least a couple amusing laughs.

It is there that I have surmised what Mr.Miyazaki is trying to tell us, that there is no distinct definition of good and evil; or in a much simpler sense, a term 'good' is a purely relative term.Because there was no 'evil' to relinquish to save the day, there was no clear achievement on the part of the protagonist. Hence, there was no clear resolution, and left me a sense of bewilderment and frustration. Particularly because there was absolutely no way for me to even 'imagine' any means of a definite conclusion within the world envisioned by the creative mind of Mr.Miyazaki. And Mononoke Hime is no exception.Perhaps as with the ilk of the movie such as 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon', this anime will clearly pique the audience's interest by it purporting a sense of novelty. That the film garnered the most revenue next to 'Titanic' is more than willing to try to coax us to see what made the Japanese so frenetic about the anime.Clearly, Mr.Miyazaki's imagination is a vivid realization of pure enchantment. The forest is drawn with stunning detail and the surroundings of Japanese mountainside and its geographical features seem to take a life of its own. But it is a bit hackneyed, as he seems to be dependent upon his formulaic approach of rendering his characters (both storywise and graphically). Pricess Mononoke looks a bit like a cross between Nausicaa and Kushana, and Ashitaka resembles Asbel. And almost all the female bellow workers are rendered in a simple manner that seems to represent a cohesive and collective organism; a bit disconcerting at worst.If the viewers are not willing to partake in the vision that is defined with Miyazaki and view the animation with a stoic sense of poignant reality privy to Western mindset, this anime will be nothing but a haphazard and silly fantasy tale spun from the wildest of lunacy. Of course, the movie should confound many people who do not know anything about various Japanese mythos, barrage of which are included in the movie to perfect Mr.Miyazaki's vision. But Mr.Miyazaki cordially and humbly invites us to his world of medieval Japan in the conflict between humans and gods, and it creates a convincing suspension of disbelief.However. The biggest flaw in the anime would be that it is trying to enumerate almost everything that is Mr.Miyazaki's philosophy on life. One can only put so much definition in a two hour movie. Just like in his celebrated manga 'Nausicaa', Mr.Miyazaki dispenses with some definite references for evil and good. Therefore, his characters in the movie are both stunningly and horrendously static, no room for growth, no changes. Even after the entire Tatara Ba is destroyed, humans will forge another means of destroying the nature. It is bound to occur again and again and again, this pointless conflict between humans and nature. But what is 'pointless' if it is permanently embedded into human history or human 'nature'? Alas, even the relationship between San and Ashitaka ends in a blur of irrevocable end. The ending is rather quick and anti-climatic to grace the film of this much expense and scope.Mr.Miyazaki's works are not my cup of tea, plainly because of it is not a wholesome entertainment within the limits of its animation or comic. But I cannot help but be intrigued by his premise and pretentious approach of presenting his ideas in such a medium. Maybe I am just a nitpicky fan of Mr.Miyazaki, an accomplished artist, who completely altered my predisposition about the animation works in general. But the anime is plainly too subdued and a dawdle of a confusing adventure.Princess Mononoke is without a resolution.

It is bound to occur again and again and again, this pointless conflict between humans and nature. But what is 'pointless' if it is permanently embedded into human history or human 'nature'? Alas, even the relationship between San and Ashitaka ends in a blur of irrevocable end. The ending is rather quick and anti-climatic to grace the film of this much expense and scope.Mr.Miyazaki's works are not my cup of tea, plainly because of it is not a wholesome entertainment within the limits of its animation or comic. But I cannot help but be intrigued by his premise and pretentious approach of presenting his ideas in such a medium. Maybe I am just a nitpicky fan of Mr.Miyazaki, an accomplished artist, who completely altered my predisposition about the animation works in general. But the anime is plainly too subdued and a dawdle of a confusing adventure.Princess Mononoke is without a resolution. Therefore it is a depressing story mired by helpless and static characters only rising up to the occasion to resolve a circumstantial dilemma. I cannot recommend this anime with a full assurance.

For love can be that most elusive of butterflies, as a smitten young man discovers in 'Il Postino,' directed by Michael Radford. There's a bit of 'Cyrano' in this tale of Mario Ruoppolo (Massimo Troisi), a somewhat unprepossessing part time mailman (he has but one customer) who falls for a local beauty, Beatrice (Maria Grazia Cucinotta), but has no idea how to pursue the longings of his heart. But as luck would have it, Mario's customer just happens to be Pablo Neruda (Philippe Noiret), a South American expatriate who is also a world renown poet recently exiled to this small island off the coast of Italy. Not wanting to make a pest of himself, Mario only very gradually strikes up an acquaintance with Neruda, while his love for Beatrice goes unrequited. Once Neruda is apprised of Mario's situation however, he begins to instruct him in the art of regarding the world around him in terms of metaphor, as well as how to thus express himself. Soon Mario is composing poetry of his own, with hopes of not only attracting Beatrice's attention, but of winning her heart.It's a warm and touching story that plays to the heart, rather than the intellect, and will capture you with it's humanity. There is nothing singular about Mario; he is nondescript, just an average guy, and it illustrates that common bond among us all, that of having wants and needs to be expressed and fulfilled-- especially with regards to matters of the heart-- for as Mario discovers, love knows no boundaries.Troisi gives a strong performance as Mario, but is almost too retiring to be effective, though his character contrasts well with that of Noiret's Neruda, whose zest for life is more readily apparent. Still, it's that underplayed sense of the 'Everyman' that Troisi conveys so well that allows the audience to relate to him. Anyone who has ever yearned for the affections of that special someone will be able to identify with Mario. Ironically, it's his benign manner that makes him-- as contradictory as it may seem-- so memorable and forgettable at the same time, perhaps depending upon the emotional investment the individual viewer is disposed to make. As the poet Neruda, Noiret gives a notable performance, lending the character the sense of one who has known celebrity, yet is nonetheless still somewhat accessible. And in him you can readily perceive a true poetic nature-- though somewhat self-centered-- which gives the character credibility and makes him real.The supporting cast includes Linda Moretti (Donna Rosa), Renato Scarpa (Telegrapher), Mariano Rigillo (Di Cosimo) and Anna Bonaiuto (Matilde). A romantic film in every sense of the word, 'Il Postino' nevertheless transcends the romantic and takes a somewhat anticlimactic turn that encompasses loyalty and passion to a cause, as well as love. In the end, it's a lyrical, pacific film that seeks to discern the beauty in all things, and certainly makes a statement about the nature of life and love. I rate this one 7\/10.

I was very excited about the prospect of a film portraying the real story of the battle of Stalingrad, complete with gritty drama and the benefit of the realism of recent films like &#145;Saving Private Ryan'. I had read some of the slightly critical reviews from the US where it had been showing for some weeks, but was sure that I would love it anyway. After seeing the film I have to say I agree with the detractors! It is a huge disappointment, it could have been so much, but fails to live up to it's potential.The first half-hour of the film is worthy of the subject, and portrays the huge drama and sacrifice of the battle. The young Russian soldiers are forced at gunpoint to walk towards the German guns with no weapons, and no chance of survival, just to die as a useless waste. The Russians still used WWI tactics and only their sheer numbers won the day for them.The film then quickly descends into a shambolic attempt to make us care about a Russian sniper (who let's face it are not very heroic figures anyway), and the love triangle he gets caught up in. The acting in some of the scenes is absolutely abysmal. I found myself cringing at some of the cheesy lines, which sounded like the actors were reading them off an auto-cue. I have to agree with the US reviewers who criticise the accents of the actors. I thought it wouldn't bother me as I am used to seeing films where Germans and Russians talk with American accents, so I though I wouldn't notice the English accents. But I have to say that even as an Englishman I thought the accents were simply laughable. Especially Jude Law who had a slightly cockney twang to his accent, presumably to portray the fact that he was more working class than Joseph Fiennes who spoke with an Oxbridge accent. The only actors who come through unscathed are Bob Hoskins in his passable portrayal of Krushchev, and Ed Harris as Major Konig who is by far the best performer in the film. For some reason a German with an American accent is more believable than a Russian with a cockney accent! When two of the main characters who we are supposed to care about are killed, it is completely unmoving. The director fails to make us care about these people.It would have been a far better story if it continued to concentrate on the heroism of the ordinary Russian soldiers, or the suffering of the cut-off German army (which is never mentioned in the film). If you want to really find out about the Eastern Front my advice is track down the German made film &#145;Stalingrad' (made by the &#145;Das Boot' team) which although lower budget is a far better portrayal.

This loopy classic has a nice message, mostly aimed at adults- take children more seriously, and let them be children.  The last shot of the film has Bart running off to play sports.  A perfect happy ending.    ","genre":"Family, Fantasy, Music"},{"date":"19 March 2001","score":"","review":"  I admit it, I'm an action junkie.  I have no problems having action substituted for plot, and therefore enjoy a lot of movies that most people think are absolute crap, but this movie doesn't fall in that category.(Some plot spoilers below, do not read if you haven't seen it)The short of it is that Seagal is a cop (detective of some sort, although we never really find out his rank, it seems he's a cop that works the streets but can do whatever the hell he wants, yeah right).  In the opening scene he saves the vice president by noticing that something with the police escort was out of place.  The scene kind of reminded me of the post-bank-robbery scene in Heat, although less realistic in this movie.  The fact that his handgun turned into a machine pistol did kind of bother me, but that's nothing unusual for this type of movie.  Anyway, after saving the VP, he's demoted because he didn't follow orders.He stumbles into a batch of bad cops at his new assignment and has a chance to redeem himself by busting up a crime ring inside the police department. The plot was actually more developed than I expected, and they pretty much didn't take any hard rights through the whole movie, which at least made it a little more believable than some other movies which omit an important detail just to leave the audience guessing.Then there's the action.  What can I say?  This entire movie is an action sequence.  I don't think I've seen as much non-stop action as this film has in a long time.  Mix that with Tom Arnolds HILARIOUS interludes (think True Lies) and plenty of gun play, and you have exactly what I was looking for when I walked into the theater.  An asskicking movie that doesn't take itself seriously.And do yourself a favor, do not leave early, the Tom Arnold scene at the end of the movie is priceless.  I haven't laughed that hard at non-PC dialogue in a long time.Rating 8\/10  (10\/10 for action and 6\/10 for plot).

The second time I saw it, I sighed. The third time, I became interested in going to see it. And the fourth time, I was convinced. Unfortunately, I never did go.  Instead I did the second best thing, I bought the book. I read it and then bought the video. I didn't mind the change of cities much. Something that did bother my remotely was the fact that his Laura was blonde (in the book she was a brunette) and that Charlie was a brunette (in the book she was a blonde). Other than that I loved it! Especially the parts in the video store and his burst out towards Laura's new boyfriend. Like I mentioned earlier they had changed a lot of things for an example one of the girlfriends on his breakup list, that he didn't visit his parents and that he didn't meet the couple with horrible music taste. Those were some of the most enjoyable moments in the book for me. But Cusack (both of them) were brilliant and I simply loved Jack Black. He was hilarious. But I would still recommend people who loved this movie to read the book also. It may take you by surprise.
