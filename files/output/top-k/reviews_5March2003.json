After a bit part in a Russ Meyer movie (his classic 'Beyond The Valley Of The Dolls'), Jack Hill, former Roger Corman protege and director of the creepy cult favourite 'Spider Baby', discovered her and gave her two strong roles in his popular chicks-in-chains movies 'The Big Doll House' and 'The Big Bird Cage'. Then Hill wrote and directed 'Coffy', a hugely entertaining revenge thriller that really showcases Pam Grier's talent and charisma to the max. The movie was hugely successful and made Grier an exploitation superstar. Instead of a female James Bond character like Cleopatra Jones, Hill made Coffy a regular working class black woman (a nurse as a matter of fact), who must use her brains and looks to achieve her goal - revenge for the drug addiction of her kid sister. The movie crosses elements seen in the male blaxploitation classics of the period like 'Superfly' and 'Shaft' with the vigilante genre which would really kick off with the success of 'Death Wish' the following year (yup, 'Coffy' PREDATES 'Death Wish', so let's get that straight). Grier is sensational in this movie. She can act, she's tough, she pulls off the action scenes with credibility, and of course she looks great, and there is a fair bit of nudity. Grier went on to movies like 'The Arena', 'Sheba, Baby' and 'Drum' before the blaxploitation boom burst, but it's a pity that she only made one more movie with Jack Hill ('Foxy Brown') because they were a dynamite team bringing out the best in each other. 'Coffy' has some interesting supporting cast members including Allan Arbus (best know to fans of TV's 'M.A.S.H.') as Mob boss Vitroni, future 'Robocop' actor Robert DoQui as flamboyant pimp King George, and the brilliant Sid Haig as the sleazy Omar. Haig was a regular Grier co-star throughout the 1970s and Jack Hill's favourite actor ever since his breakthrough role in 'Spider Baby'. If you really want to understand why so many movie buffs from Quentin Tarantino on down worship Pam Grier then 'Coffy' is THE movie to watch. Arguably her best movie, it's a blaxploitation classic and still great viewing thirty years later! Highly recommended to anyone with an interest in 1970s exploitation or crime movies.

Another could be that you just did not try to understand the movie.  A real movie lover will love this ovie as it offers a major challenge.  The challenge is to understand this movie by sort through the clues that are given to you.  Some clues bear no meaning, so do.  As happens in our dreams.The story actually begins when Noami Watts' character wakes up as Diane. (not Betty).  This movie is a story of obssesion.The first part of the movie, Diane dreams that she is Betty, an aspiring actress that comes to Hollywood to be an actress.  Yes, many weird things happen.  She falls in love with the amnesia plagued stranger - Rita - and they go off on a quest to find Rita's identity.THEN, Diane wakes up.  Now Diane (which is the dead girl in the bed when Betty and Rita climb in a house through the window - She dreams about her own death), she is obssessed by Camilla.  They where both actresses and fell in love, Camilla eventually dumps her for a movie director.  So Diane cannot bear the pain, she hire a contract killer to kill Camilla, because she is obsessed and jealous.Diane wakes up and the combination of everything gets to her.  She hallucinates that her grand-parents come in form under the door and go after her, and then she shoots herself.  At this point, this lady has lost her mind.  That is the movie.  Now the way to understand the movie is to Watch it Again.  Once Diane wakes up, pay attention to every little detail that you see on the screen. Because when Diane wakes up, that is reality. Sure, we are suggested to a few flashbacks, but the informartion in these flashbacks is crucial.  That information explains the unexplained elements of the first part.We all know that things that happen to you during the course of your day, can come back in your dream in different circumstances.  Here are a few examples.  When Diane is contracting her assasin in the DINER, the waitresses' name is BETTY.  The blue key?  That is the key that the assasin will give to Diane once the deed has been done.  Did you get the cowboy? I did not think so.  It's very stupid...when Diane is at the supper party with Camilla, the director and whole bunch of other people, Diane glances through the room and a man in a cowboy hat walks by... and that's how a man with a cowboy hat ends up in her dream.I won't spoile it all for you, because the beauty of this movie is to find all these little unexplained details and associate them with their meaning.  Most commenteers on here have not given this movie a fair chance. You need to watch this movies several times before getting everything - and that is what i call art.No, this movie is nothing like Blue Velvet or Twin Peaks, but is that not a good thing?I am not trying to say that the poeple that have given bad reviews are idiots that do not know movies, but I think that real movie lovers  are missing out by not watching this movie over and over.

I taped it and I'm glad I did, because it deserves a second watching. It also deserves better than it got from just about everyone who touched it along the way, from the studio who held it and re-edited it and sorta dumped it into theatres with little publicity, to the critics who quickly panned it, partly, I'm sure because so many of the actors are familiar faces from TV or music video.The movie has flaws. It plays very much like a pilot for a TV series, albeit with better production values. The plot seems uneven, which may be the script, but feels more like bad editing. I have a feeling that it was shot as an R and edited into a PG-13 and suffered for it. It is derivative, but so is most drama, even Shakespeare.The feel of the movie is fairly accurate to the time and place, with just a couple of jarring moments. While I think Usher did a great job with his character, there is no way that a reconstruction-era Texas Ranger Company would have included a Negro -- or that he would have called himself black. For the truly steeped in Western history the character of King Fisher was way off base. This is, however, the kind of flaw we've seen in Westerns that used the names of famous or infamous characters and little else about them.I liked the movie. If it was a pilot for a weekly series, I would make time for it in my busy TV-viewing schedule. Watching Dylan McDermott pass the reins of command to James Van Der Beek, who showed his mettle as a leader, was worth the time spent getting there. Most of the rest of the actors did a decent job with the plot they were given and the lines they had to speak. Robert Patrick and Randy Travis are journeymen, and acted like it. The younger cast members did well, but I have to admit I kept expecting Ashton Kutcher to ask where his horse was, Dude. I would like to have seen more development of the character Rachael Leigh Cook played. Though she was more outspoken than most young women of the period, there were some like her and it would have been interesting to see where that went.If ever a movie cried out for a director's cut DVD, this is the one. I don't think Steve Miner set out to make a nearly $40 million dollar bomb. Someone hijacked this project and ran it off the tracks, in my opinion. I'd like to see the movie all these people thought they were making.Would I recommend it? Yes, with the reservations I outlined. Call it a 6 out of 10. And I will see it again. There are nits to be picked about the firearms used, always a sore point with this reviewer, who portrays a US Deputy Marshal in the 1880s on weekends and has seldom seen a movie without flaws in this area.

I taped it and I'm glad I did, because it deserves a second watching. It also deserves better than it got from just about everyone who touched it along the way, from the studio who held it and re-edited it and sorta dumped it into theatres with little publicity, to the critics who quickly panned it, partly, I'm sure because so many of the actors are familiar faces from TV or music video.The movie has flaws. It plays very much like a pilot for a TV series, albeit with better production values. The plot seems uneven, which may be the script, but feels more like bad editing. I have a feeling that it was shot as an R and edited into a PG-13 and suffered for it. It is derivative, but so is most drama, even Shakespeare.The feel of the movie is fairly accurate to the time and place, with just a couple of jarring moments. While I think Usher did a great job with his character, there is no way that a reconstruction-era Texas Ranger Company would have included a Negro -- or that he would have called himself black. For the truly steeped in Western history the character of King Fisher was way off base. This is, however, the kind of flaw we've seen in Westerns that used the names of famous or infamous characters and little else about them.I liked the movie. If it was a pilot for a weekly series, I would make time for it in my busy TV-viewing schedule. Watching Dylan McDermott pass the reins of command to James Van Der Beek, who showed his mettle as a leader, was worth the time spent getting there. Most of the rest of the actors did a decent job with the plot they were given and the lines they had to speak. Robert Patrick and Randy Travis are journeymen, and acted like it. The younger cast members did well, but I have to admit I kept expecting Ashton Kutcher to ask where his horse was, Dude.

There are a couple of hilarious and outragous moments (including the camp fire scene, and the wacky ending that could only be a part of a Mel Brooks film) and there are a few funny moments and jokes, as well as a truck load of small, cheap, so-so, and failed jokes. This was the time when Brooks was the master of complete lunacy, and he continued to do so up until just after History of the World, he toned down a bit. In his later comedies such as Spaceballs, you still find some hilarious and crazy moments, but you can tell that Brooks lost his edge some.

They are seen as those who steal from the rich and give to the poor. The gang includes Jesse James, Frank James Cole Younger, Jim Younger, Bob Younger, Clell Miller and Lonnie Packwood.  The movie was good in story line as well as action sequences but was not historically accurate. The movie portrayed the gang as a bunch of comedians and wimps, but in real life they were not this way.  The whole gang fought in the civil war as Confederate guerrillas and did go to war with the railroad.  But the way they were portrayed is not the way they truly were.  Bob Younger was seen as a fast talker and a real smart mouth in the movie.  Yet in real life he was really a mute who could not say a word if he wanted to.  Cole Younger was not changed -- he was portrayed as a hot headed person.  But in the movie was a bit too nice compared to the real Cole Younger.  Jim really did not get to ride with the gang that long.  Frank was portrayed the way he should have been, and Jesse was not as comical as he was seen in the movie.  The James' mother was never killed in the explosion, but did lose her son as a result. Union soldiers shot her in the arm a year later.  Mr. Allan Pinkerton (Timothy Dalton) the secret service agent hired by the railroad to take out Jesse James, did a really good job on his part.  He brought the reality a bit more closely.  Mrs. James (Kathy Bates) was really good at her part, and she brought out the religious part of the family that was left out in past movies.  Jesse James (Collin Farrell) was not meant for his role. He is an Irish man, not a Missourian or a man of the south.  Nothing against him.  I did not enjoy his work that much.  Zerelda James (Ali Larter) portrayed the best Zee James I have ever seen.  It was like I was really there when I saw her and how involved she was in the movie.  In the movie they said that Jesse James was captured is a lie.  They knew that he would get out or could never be caught, so they wanted him dead.  It was the easiest thing to do so if he would have been caught.  They would have shot him immediately. This movie is fine for a western, but as a historical document is flawed. I enjoyed it, but hated the fact that the actors were not as they should have been.

Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster), an FBI student, is training to work with the criminally insane. She is called upon to interview and `to learn' from the well-known Hannibal Lector.  In reality she is not only learning from the interviews, but helping to solve the case.   Hannibal will hopefully give some insight on the new killer, Buffalo Bill.  Being very careful, Lector is a very intelligent person, and could see right through anyone.  Yet he is very particular on how he gives Starling his information.  She tells him something about her and than he gives the information she needs to figure out the case. But does she realize what the information is before it is too late? I believe the director, Jonathan Demmel was trying to portray realism in the idea that the criminally insane are extraordinary,  from the way they scope out there prey to the way they act upon once they're ready.  It's amazing in itself.  The movie was so life like and seemed so real, I found myself looking for the `based on a true story' at the end.  Another aspect believed is definitely suspense. Foster will keep one on their toes through out the whole movie, leaving the viewer to wonder what is next. I found Hannibal Lector (Anthony Hopkins) to have played his role exquisitely!  I felt that he was really some crazed cannibal.  The cell they first showed Hopkins in was so amazingly true, from its plastic caged in area to the drawer that allows things to be passed back and forth.  He is allowed nothing.  The whole basement, where the cell was located, was like the Munster's dungeon.  The reality of this movie makes me admire the FBI for what they do. The well played roles and realism of the movie all come together perfectly to form a great movie.  If you like being on the edge of your seat, going to fall off, hold on the arm of the chair in suspense, I recommend this movie. If you have a week stomach, I would hold off on the popcorn and the rental.

Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster), an FBI student, is training to work with the criminally insane. She is called upon to interview and `to learn' from the well-known Hannibal Lector.  In reality she is not only learning from the interviews, but helping to solve the case.   Hannibal will hopefully give some insight on the new killer, Buffalo Bill.  Being very careful, Lector is a very intelligent person, and could see right through anyone.  Yet he is very particular on how he gives Starling his information.  She tells him something about her and than he gives the information she needs to figure out the case. But does she realize what the information is before it is too late?

Edward Norton plays Derek Vinyard, a prodigious, reformed, former white supremacist released from prison after three years for killing two African-Americans. Edward Furlong portrays Danny, his younger brother, who idolizes Derek (even more so after said arrest) and begins moving along the same hate-filled path in high school. The film crosscuts between the past, in black and white, beginning with Derek's lapse into racism inherited by his father (who's killed by a gang while working as a firefighter) to his release from prison and between his contemporary attempts in the course of about 12 hours to set Danny straight. Danny's come under the thumbs of Cameron, a rich white-power activist who funds propaganda, parties, white power bands, etc, and once schooled Derek.Norton's Derek is portrayed as resorting to hard-core white supremacy as a panacea to the gap left in his life after his father's murder, and eventually growing to impose it on his family as shown in an absolutely shocking dinner-table scene before going completely out of control and ending up in prison. He complete transforms himself into the character, and his Derek makes an almost swaying argument about the marginalization of people in America that can happen because of `affirmative action'; more appropriately, it's easy to see what would make him resort to this form of hatred and neo-Nazism based on his personal experiences, and what makes him so convincing and influential to Danny. Derek isn't shown as a monster the way one would expect, but rather as an intelligent, sincerely enraged young man resorting to violence and enmity as explanation for the wrong blows life has dealt him; he rationalizes in hate and bigotry to compensate for what's gone wrong. And he's absolutely terrifying, while also immediately accessible. Furthermore, the dynamic between Furlong and Norton is totally believable as a relationship between brothers; Derek looks out for Danny and talks to him as an adult while they both know Danny's still a kid. The acting between the two of them reminded me in an off way of my own older brother; he's not a neo-Nazi, don't get me wrong, but the way awkwardness and love mix between two different ages is totally accurate in terms of emotional chemistry.The movie approaches the race issue level-headedly and, while it definitely takes the side against racism and prejudice, it shows why people can be driven to grasp it so intensely as well as to how they can `unlearn' it. Danny follows Derek's example not because he too is consumed by the same rage but because he needs a positive role model. With this in mind, a reformed (I'm hesitant to use the word, because reformation is usually deliberate, whereas Derek is shown watching his neo-Nazist stability fall apart under its own weight in prison for a variety of reasons) Derek tries to dissuade him before it's too late. The white power group is shocked and confused when he comes back bitterly opposed to their message and in a way you can see how these people are bound together lovingly- almost like a community - through their supremacist opinions.This is an important movie that deals with critical issues in our (or any) society. It's stunningly atrocious to watch and viscerally compelling, with a message that's challenging, acceptable, controversial and ultimately a thing of beauty at its center. The only problems I have with the movie are totally separate from the subject matter, but rather with the presentation of it - wall-to-wall music, slow-motion photography, etc. The dramatic impact of the scenes is potent enough on the basis of their contents, and doesn't need to be glossed up or saturated for an audience to be understood. This isn't really a problem in the movie, because the performances and dialogue keep things going smoothly, but in a more porous script I fear that this style of direction would slow things down to the point of pretension and self-indulgence. Director\/cinematographer Tony Kaye seems to succumb (and this is really the only true flaw the movie could have aside from sheer unpleasantness) to a safe, clean presentation of acerbic, combustible dramatic material. This is a brilliant, electrifying stuff that needs to be seen by anyone who's wondered about the consequences (or the realistic defects) of intolerance.
