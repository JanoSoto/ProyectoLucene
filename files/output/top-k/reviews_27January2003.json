After all the Hellraiser series is also reviving with the releases of both H5 Inferno and H6 Hellseeker so there's no reason why the Halloween series couldn't take a turn for the better.The start of the movie actually got me excited but after the first 20 minutes or so the quality of the plot dropped rapidly. Resurrection's plots exploits 2 completely different ideas. On the one hand it tries to make some sort of ethical statement about reality-TV and the TV-stations who are exploiting people for pure profit, on the other hand Rick Rosenthal just tried to put in as much gore as possible to keep the fans happy. The plot stays very superficial throughout the movie and for those who have watched their fair share of slasher movies it isn't hard to predict the outcome of the movie when you're not even halfway trough it.The man with the white mask has a lot of screentime in this one which isn't bad at all. Without his regular appearance you wouldn't be able to know if you were watching Resurrection,Scream 4 or I still,still know what you did last summer ! The whole movie is just an average teenage horror movie. Scream was exciting but after all the ripoffs and spinoffs we have seen it all. Teenage horror is just as dead as it was before Scream's release and the fans are desperately waiting for some fresh ideas.The cast is young,enthusiastic and trying to make the best of it except for Busta Rhymes, who is the perfect example that not all rappers are also good actors. His performance is an absolute joke; was it that hard to find somebody with at least some talent ?Those who are looking for some easy entertainment can't go wrong with this movie. There are body-parts,enough blood and a few twists to keep those who are new to the genre on the edge of their seat. The diehard fan will be disappointed however and it's once more the proof that legends like Michael Myers and Jason Voorhees have become pure cash-cows for Hollywood. I can only advise the people who plan to spent cash on this one to look around carefully if they can't find any of the true slasher-classics (from the 80's) before you take Resurrection to the checkout-counter.

The screenplay that is the stuff of RPG video games -- i.e. flipping a switch, and then a camera shot of some far-off room's lights coming on -- is captured quite well in this movie.  And the camera zooms and pans that you find when objects like trains are accelerating and slowing down... captured in cinematic genius as well.  The brief flashes of the licker that you might recall from the game's beginning... also captured in the film. Basically, if you really appreciated the kind of suspense that only video game play brings, then you'll enjoy that part of this movie.  The characters are also brought to life pretty well.  I have read reviews here where people complain that the actors have no expressions.  Well, guess what?  The subtleties of the expressions are exactly as you would see them in the video game.  Action is similar too, and zombies respond to shots the same.  If you've ever played through Resident Evil and wondered, Hmmmm what would these short animations look like in a full-length movie?  Well, they're so cool that I give this film an 8.5 if you enjoyed the game.  The director did a fabulous job recreating the video game!I was able to take a step back though and ask myself what I'd think of this movie if I had never played the game.  The beginning 15 minutes, as somebody has mentioned, is a pain to sit through.  You're left guessing a little too much what the hell is going on.  And the dialogue is a little unnatural (e.g. when the Hive is described) -- but again this is all mimicking the gameplay to a T.  The scenes are not particularly scary, and the music is definitely blase.  The scary parts are a little too predictable, and there's a wide range in which zombies get put out of commission to the point where it seems pretty unrealistic (e.g. in one scene it takes 20 bullets to drop a zombie, and in another, a glass paperweight on the back of the head suffices).  From a strictly horror film standpoint -- with special effects, storyline, dialogue, action, suspence, and gore in mind, this movie doesn't quite cut it. 3\/10.

It's a way to give you a certain feeling, without you really knowing were this feeling comes from. When the music is bad, the movie is bad most of the times, when the music is good, it can make a movie soo much better (it's never enough to save a bad movie though). And that is the case with this movie, Martin Scorcese choose to keep the music from the original 1962 Cape Fear, and I am glad he did!. The music creeps up on you, get's you by the throat and is even more violent than Max Cady will ever be.The acting is also great, I love Julliette Lewis, she has kind of a lost puppy look, but as always she can be real mean when you least expect it. Nick Nolte was brilliant, I think this is the best performance I have ever seen of him. I think it's part the script and part the fact that he wasn't on the booze at the time this movie was made. Downpart is Jessica Lange who delivers a hysterical screaming wive in distress. There should have been some more depth in her character. Robert de Niro, he looks a bit old for a tough inmate guy. He claims to have learned a lot of filosophy, and talks wise.. but on the other hand he is a stalking murderer. I think these contradictions are a bit strange and unbelievable. But it does not ruin the movie.The biggest flaw in this movie, in my opinion, is the whole rape- non-rape issue. Cady (de niro) claims that Nolte held back some information, the girl he raped was a slut.. and this information would have gotten him out of prison, he claims. I think that is a bit far off, besides, who get 14 years for rape?.But if you take this for granted, then you will enjoy this movie.

And what annoys me is that BABE beat SUSPECTS to the Best Picture Nomination. Watch THE USUAL SUSPECTS, and you will wonder why it didn't get a best picture OSCAR nod. The talking pig isn't so good after all.

Ordinary Levis had been marketed in their pristine stiff, dark-blue state. After a dozen or so launderings they faded naturally to a sort of powder blue and thinned out at the knees. It became chic to wear these worn-out jeans. Catching onto this fad, the manufacturers began to market brand new jeans that were already faded and beat-up looking, for which the consumer paid full price. It even became possible to buy brand new raggedy cut-offs that looked like rejects from a Goodwill Store. This movie reminds me of those brand-new old jeans. Because movies were undergoing a similar process, whose dynamics were unknown even to professional students of collective behavior. There were genuinely weird and honest cult movies like The Rocky Horror Picture Show and others, so ridiculous, so quirky, that they were attended not by audiences but by congregations. Then there appeared fake cult classics, designed from the outset to resemble the honest originals, the way those new faded jeans resembled the originals. Scotland, PA strikes me as one of those higher-order fakes, an attempt to market a cult movie by imitating cult movies. Oddball lines, characters who come and go without explanation, strange locutions, even stranger music, all very original. The Cohn brothers are an obvious influence here and not to good effect. Principally what has been borrowed is the tendency to underilluminate scenes (as in Blood Simple) so it's not always possible to see what's going on. There is a good deal of laconic dialgue with lots of pauses between lines that are either clever or semi-clever. Having read the play doesn't help much. Incidents are borrowed in some warped form (the grease burn on Lady MacBeth's hand) or left out entirely (the slaughter of MacDuff's family or the woods coming to Dunsinane). It all struck me as no more than mildly amusing at its best, and my mind wandered until I found I was actually pondering the self parody of those new old faded jeans. That's a pretty bad sign. The fault lies not with the performers. They're all pretty good, especially Maura Tierney and Chris Walken, who doesn't do an impression of Colombo so much as a suggestion of him. Man, he is fun to watch. I certainly wouldn't sit through this a second time but don't regret having seen it once, if only to satisfy my curiosity. I fear the film makers weren't as amusing as they might have thought. And the contemporary rock music is plain awful -- and too loud.

They are lesser characters but really help the film. The `girlfriends' are all excellent and a mix of faces &#150; Hjejle is good while Jones, Taylor, Gilbert etc are very funny.  Oh, and Bonet is `oh my God' sexyOverall this is a great film if you can relate to the central character.  If you can't then you might enjoy the comedy and the story but you won't take as much from it.  I hated Rob because his petty listing and bickering reminded me of myself but it was a good ride nonetheless.  Funny and insightful &#150; all men should watch it rather than arguing over the top five movies which feature male flaws.
