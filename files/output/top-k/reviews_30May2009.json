(Note every other 5 minute sketch stretched to 1.5 hours either falls flat or is mediocre, at best.) From the excellent cameos (Alice Cooper was downright hilarious) to the music segments that rock to the talk-to-the-camera and spoofs that produce some of the funniest moments, 'Wayne's World' really does work. Too many great quotes to reprint, I found myself saying out loud half the movie. It helped that, when in theaters (1992) I saw it 3x. I took a date who coincidentally was the same person I took to only my second concert Alice Cooper. She didn't understand most of the humor, while I was rolling with laughter. Furthermore, I remember her wondering why Cooper talked the way he did backstage as opposed to on stage. If you don't follow that, or a lot of the inside jokes, this movie may not be for you. However, anyone who grew up in the 70s and 80s should very much appreciate the quality of jokes and references. I.E. 'Laverne & Shirley in Scooby Doo's Mystery of Noah's Ark.' Basic plot involves the late night cable access (long before internet) show 'Wayne's World' is being targeted to a wider audience by a suspicious Rob Lowe. Everything else is just 1 skit after another, that was actually original and consistent. The entire cast was great, including Carrere, Carvey, O'Neill and Boyle. The soundtrack was wonderful. Even the chemistry between Carrere\/Myers rang true (and on the other side, the relationship between Myers and his ex also showed honesty.) The only thing that did not fare well was 'Wayne's World 2.' But that's another movie all together. Watch the original & avoid the sequel at all costs.

It does more then enough to keep you very entertained and connected with what's going on and certainly keeps you laughing! What makes this movie so favoured is for two main reasons.1) The casting was superb and a sure excellent choice. Not one actor\/actress was disappointing never the less the script was too superior to the acting, it was not brilliant but very decent and very funny. The now familiar but up coming star in those times, the legendary Will Smith. (mike Lawry) Was as you would expect powerful, funny and himself! Flawless job. Along side him another star. Martin Lawrence (Marcus Burnett) as you would expect too he was very funny and also a delight to watch.

But one thing is for sure, some scenes were a little overdone. Perhaps it was the camera shots or the background music or even the look on the actors faces. The phenomenal director Michael Bay did a magnificent job. After making many minors he stepped up to make his first real movie, with a bigger budget and bigger cast for the big screen.

McCoy is behaving like a man possessed, the Genesis planet is behaving like a planet possessed and Sarek wants to know why Kirk did not return Spock's Katra, his living spirit, back to Vulcan. When the crew discover what has occurred they are determined to return Spock, both his body and his spirit to Vulcan, but after being caught in the Genesis wave, the planet has re-energised Spock's body.Add to this a renegade Klingon who sees the Genesis device as a powerful weapon and you have in the mix one of the most under-rated Star Trek films of the lot. The script barely allows one to settle in the seat as the Klingons arrive with a sense of destructive menace rarely seen in Star Trek villains, the script is first rate star trek story telling and the direction by Nimoy is absolutely excellent, the scene with Shatner falling over the chair after his son is killed is particularly poignant, and performed so well, you can barely believe that it is Shatner whose doing it, but I guess such direction and acting can only be achieved when it involves two people who have worked together so closely over the years, and this is Shatner's film, he is excellent in this one. The score by James Horner is magnificent and easily rivals the work done in Star Trek II and when the film concludes it does so with a genuine sense of How are they going to get out of this one? So why does it get so bad-mouthed. Well I can think of two reasons, the first being that it would be difficult for many people to accept this could be as good as the much-loved Star Trek II. Also I think that many people found it hard to accept Spock coming back as he had been killed off in the previous film. I have no such problems and see this as the middle part of the great Star Trek Kobyoshi Maru trilogy, that starts with II, sees III as the middle part and concludes with IV. The last thing that makes this special, for me, is the scene in the bar with the admiral who tells Kirk his career stands for rationality and not intellectual chaos. Since when? Kirk always picked the most unpredictable irrational plan, that's why Spock was there, to be the rational one. Clearly this guy has got the wrong file and Kirk looking into space reflects that.

Years later I sat down to watch this movie and I found myself enjoying. Even laughing quite a bit. This and The Replacement Killers are the movies that had people labeling the director Antoine Fuqua as the black Michael Bay. I don't see how since most of Fuqua's movies are smarter than anything Michael Bay has came up with. At any rate...Story Alvin Sanders(Jamie Foxx) is former convict that is used by a no-nonsense Treasury agent Edgar(David Morse) as a pawn to catch a killer named Bristol(Doug Hutchinson). Alvin's every moves are tracked by a bug implanted in his jaw after an accident. While these agents are after Bristol, Bristol is after the gold bricks that were taken in a heist gone awry.Jamie Foxx is funny as well as great as Alvin Sanders. Alvin is a fast-talker that is a lot smarter than he lets on. Doug Hutchinson is okay as Bristol. He can be over-the-top sometimes in his John Malkovitchesque demeanor. He was better here than he was as Looney Bin Jim in Punisher War Zone. David Morse is good as the hard edged treasury agent. Even Mike Epps is funny as Alvin's brother Stevie. Both him and Jamie had some funny moments on screen.The only flaw of the movie is the some of the attempts at a thriller fall flat. The scenario at the horse race track is way over-the-top but I couldn't look away. The director went all out there so he gets points for that.

Its never boring, its always funny and I wasn't checking my watch every minute. That should count for something. Bait is one of the most underrated movies of 2000 period.PS to the reviewer that claimed this movie is too violent.... How long have you been living under a rock?

The fanboy mentality strikes again. When this movie came out just about everyone slammed it. Even my ex-girlfriend said this movie questionable. Years later I sat down to watch this movie and I found myself enjoying. Even laughing quite a bit. This and The Replacement Killers are the movies that had people labeling the director Antoine Fuqua as the black Michael Bay. I don't see how since most of Fuqua's movies are smarter than anything Michael Bay has came up with. At any rate...Story Alvin Sanders(Jamie Foxx) is former convict that is used by a no-nonsense Treasury agent Edgar(David Morse) as a pawn to catch a killer named Bristol(Doug Hutchinson). Alvin's every moves are tracked by a bug implanted in his jaw after an accident. While these agents are after Bristol, Bristol is after the gold bricks that were taken in a heist gone awry.Jamie Foxx is funny as well as great as Alvin Sanders. Alvin is a fast-talker that is a lot smarter than he lets on. Doug Hutchinson is okay as Bristol. He can be over-the-top sometimes in his John Malkovitchesque demeanor. He was better here than he was as Looney Bin Jim in Punisher War Zone. David Morse is good as the hard edged treasury agent. Even Mike Epps is funny as Alvin's brother Stevie. Both him and Jamie had some funny moments on screen.The only flaw of the movie is the some of the attempts at a thriller fall flat. The scenario at the horse race track is way over-the-top but I couldn't look away. The director went all out there so he gets points for that. Plus the bomb scene with the treasury agent tied to a chair while the detonator rests on the door was pretty nifty.All in all Bait is not a bad movie by a long shot. Its never boring, its always funny and I wasn't checking my watch every minute. That should count for something. Bait is one of the most underrated movies of 2000 period.PS to the reviewer that claimed this movie is too violent.... How long have you been living under a rock?

In the late 70's, film goers had been shown aliens as friendly visitors from outer space, in films such as Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Nothing could prepare audiences for Alien. What is it that makes Alien scary? It's a combination of expert directing and set designing skills along side the spine-tingling atmosphere that Ridley Scott creates. The scenes on the alien planet are disturbing in a sense, the derelict has a dark and brooding atmosphere which plays to the audiences fear of the unknown.The most memorable scene in the film by far is the chestburster scene. This scene had squeamish audience members puke in the aisles and some people never return to the movie because of that scene. The chestburster played to the universal fear of birth, something that deeply disturbed some viewers. After the chestburster, there is actually very little blood in the film. Ridley Scott uses the technique pioneered by John Carpenter in Halloween which is to show as little as possible and leave it to the viewer's imagination.The alien is only on screen for a few moments in the film, but it makes one hell of an impression.

In the meantime, all on the Earth prepare for the worst case scenario.Deep Impact was always going to be a tough sell to the movie watching world. In spite of its best intentions to blend epic disaster with a great big human heart, Deep Impact neither appeased the sci-fi crowd or fulfilled the effects hungry popcorn brigade's gargantuan appetites. Too talky said one side of the cinema, that's just ridiculous said the other, hey isn't this supposed to be a corny disaster film asked the balcony, here in lays the problem. Director Mimi Leder and her writing team of Bruce Rubin and Michael Tolkin are guilty of not taking a side from which to launch their picture out of the mundane atmosphere. Or perhaps maybe, it was just a bold gamble that didn't pay off? but i'm sure nobody involved in the picture would have wanted the viewers to be hankering for the effects laden finale, and that's what happens, ultimately it's the so-so carnage that most end up remembering. Worst still is that outside of Téa Leoni's news lady central character, Jenny Lerner, no characters are fully formed to make us even care if they and the Earth actually survives. Which in a film pro porting to be an intimate study of relationships and how mankind copes with impending doom, is nearly unforgivable.It's odd that in the same year as Bruce Willis and Michael Bay firmly went for the popcorn crowd with Armageddon, that Deep Impact was offered up as the thinking mans opposite side of the coin. Yet the reality is that Deep Impact got confused about its worth, and sadly falls some way short of being the fine movie that it obviously looked like being down on the page. A good cast is wasted and a brave move is sadly unrealised. 5\/10 because deep down it does in fact pose some rather interesting questions, questions that at least make Deep Impact worth a revisit on a quiet and boring Sunday evening by the fire, but it's definitely a case of so near and yet so far far away.

Each of the teens is looking for something different from their parents. Jim is hounded by the question of what it takes to be a man but gets no help from his hen-pecked father. Judy justifiably feels unloved due to her father's suddenly frigid demeanor. Plato, meanwhile, doesn't even have his parents around at all, therefore he feels lonely and abandoned. These problems (and a multitude of others) haven't vanished in the time since this film was released.The direction by Nicholas Ray brings this story to life and shows some interesting touches along the way. The opening credits with Jim drunkenly messing around with a toy monkey is just one memorable scene. The 'chickie run' scene is perhaps the film's most memorable set-piece.The movie also benefits from a legendary performance from James Dean, who didn't even live long enough to see the film hit theatres. His performance here is angst-ridden and filled with nuance. Perhaps his best scene is the one in which he confronts his parents when he returns from the chicken run. Puzzlingly, though, he never got an Oscar nomination while both Mineo & Wood did. Mineo was certainly deserving but to me Wood's performance was nothing particularly special.

Forty years would elapse before Stanley Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey (1968) would rival Lang's epic spectacle about a troubled, dystopian society fractured along the fault lines of the economic inequality isolating the haves and the have-nots. Nevertheless, nothing could ever be said to surpass Metropolis as a film of beauty, majestic, and surrealism.The preamble encapsulates the film's timeless, universal message It has a moral that grows on the pillar of understanding. The mediator between the brain and muscle must be the heart.  Metropolis inspired generations of filmmakers with its use of state-of-the-art visual effects that transformed the science fiction film. Thea Von Harbou's saga about an evil robot is designed by a vengeful inventor to impersonate a flesh & blood female Christ figure and incite anarchy can clearly be traced as a source of inspiration to many contemporary sci-fi films and television shows, such as the Terminator franchise, Robocop franchise, Blade Runner, Logan's Run, The Fifth Element, and Battlestar Galactic. The Metropolis robot was not the first robot, but it was unmistakably the seminal one that sired a long line of cinematic robots. The famous transformation scene where the robot turns into a human foreshadows the Frankenstein franchise.Many detractors of Lang's visionary work&#x97;primarily noted sci-fi author H.G. Wells--derided it as shallow and his criticisms are not without substance. Indeed, the characters lack depth because they represent archetypes instead of individuals in a larger-than-life story. The spectacle, this Marxist chronicle of humanity at odds with itself over machinery, and the anarchy that emerges from this division makes Metropolis a memorable mediation about our flawed society, part sci-fi, part horror and a statement about the incompatibility polarity that comes about between those who control and those who are controlled. Again, von Harbou's theme re-echoes with greater intensity. The virtuous Maria would say that the head and the hands would need a mediator and the mediator would be the heart. You cannot understand and appreciate science fiction as a cinematic genre until you see that every sci-fi film owes a debt of gratitude to Lang's masterly work of genius. Actually, while Lang would make many great movies in a long career, the legendary Austrian director never made another sci-fi film that surpassed this milestone.A malevolent robot, messianic crusaders, a patriarchal titan of industry, a mad scientist with vengeance in his heart, and masses of mindless men and women enslaved by the patriarch constitute the array of characters in this milestone of German Expressionist cinema that embraces Art-Deco in his architectural designs. Scenarist Thea von Harbou and Fritz Lang assembled these protagonists and antagonists for the clash of the century with visuals that were designed to overwhelm 1920's audiences by their sheer beauty and grandeur. In the annals of science fiction film, these special effects, involving the use of mirrors to supplement shots of live action, matte paintings for sprawling cityscapes, and miniatures of the city, were singular. All the planes, trains, and automobiles in the long shots were done either with wires pulling them along or shot-action photography. Reportedly, Lang got the idea for his cityscape from a trip to Manhattan, but there are too many undocumented stories about Lang and his inspiration so you'd have to read the biographies available about his life to sort out the fiction from the facto. One thing is certain Lang was more a film dictator than a director and he toiled endlessly and made his cast and collaborators toil to forge his vision. Lang drove his actors, actresses, and technical crew like a slave driver and often exhibited a sense of perfectionism that defied civility and common sense. He amounted to a cinematic Herod.While Metropolis qualifies as sci-fi, the film also dabbles in the disaster film. The villainous father of the hero, Joh Fredersen (Alfred Abel), enlists the evil inventor, C.A. Rotwang (Rudolf Klein-Rogge), to create a robot look-alike of the virginal heroine, Maria, who preaches a gospel of sorts to unit the workers. Rotwang dresses in dark colors, has wind-blown hair, and wears a black glove on his right hand. Fredersen wants Rotwang to forge a robot that can assume the identity of Marie (Brigitte Helm), mislead the masses, and get them to destroy themselves. Joh has obtained secret plans for meetings among the workers and wants to thwart them. When they learn about the meeting, Rotwang escorts Joh down into the 2000 year old catacombs to witness Marie preaching her gospel of unification and that is where Joh sees his son Freder (Gustav Fröhlich) appear and embrace Maria. Freder has been smitten by Maria since he saw her first early in the film. She entered the Club of Sons where Freder cavorted with various women. Freder was so stricken by Marie that he descended to the depths where the workers operated the machines and witnessed a meltdown. Joh is worried about his son's dalliance with the workers because it threatens to destroy everything that he has worked for so many years. Eventually, the false Maria does mislead the workers into destroying the machines and the loss of power leads to a flood that wipes out their homes.Lang deals with one of his recurring themes mob violence. He explored mob violence in M (1931) with Peter Lorre and Fury (1936) with Spencer Tracy. Although Metropolis has been available as an inexpensive public domain film for over 40 years, Kino Video has released a splendid restored version that true movie lovers will genuinely appreciate for its clarity of picture. Meanwhile, this is one hell of a silent German movie!

Actually, while Lang would make many great movies in a long career, the legendary Austrian director never made another sci-fi film that surpassed this milestone.A malevolent robot, messianic crusaders, a patriarchal titan of industry, a mad scientist with vengeance in his heart, and masses of mindless men and women enslaved by the patriarch constitute the array of characters in this milestone of German Expressionist cinema that embraces Art-Deco in his architectural designs. Scenarist Thea von Harbou and Fritz Lang assembled these protagonists and antagonists for the clash of the century with visuals that were designed to overwhelm 1920's audiences by their sheer beauty and grandeur. In the annals of science fiction film, these special effects, involving the use of mirrors to supplement shots of live action, matte paintings for sprawling cityscapes, and miniatures of the city, were singular. All the planes, trains, and automobiles in the long shots were done either with wires pulling them along or shot-action photography. Reportedly, Lang got the idea for his cityscape from a trip to Manhattan, but there are too many undocumented stories about Lang and his inspiration so you'd have to read the biographies available about his life to sort out the fiction from the facto. One thing is certain Lang was more a film dictator than a director and he toiled endlessly and made his cast and collaborators toil to forge his vision. Lang drove his actors, actresses, and technical crew like a slave driver and often exhibited a sense of perfectionism that defied civility and common sense. He amounted to a cinematic Herod.While Metropolis qualifies as sci-fi, the film also dabbles in the disaster film. The villainous father of the hero, Joh Fredersen (Alfred Abel), enlists the evil inventor, C.A. Rotwang (Rudolf Klein-Rogge), to create a robot look-alike of the virginal heroine, Maria, who preaches a gospel of sorts to unit the workers. Rotwang dresses in dark colors, has wind-blown hair, and wears a black glove on his right hand. Fredersen wants Rotwang to forge a robot that can assume the identity of Marie (Brigitte Helm), mislead the masses, and get them to destroy themselves. Joh has obtained secret plans for meetings among the workers and wants to thwart them. When they learn about the meeting, Rotwang escorts Joh down into the 2000 year old catacombs to witness Marie preaching her gospel of unification and that is where Joh sees his son Freder (Gustav Fröhlich) appear and embrace Maria. Freder has been smitten by Maria since he saw her first early in the film. She entered the Club of Sons where Freder cavorted with various women. Freder was so stricken by Marie that he descended to the depths where the workers operated the machines and witnessed a meltdown. Joh is worried about his son's dalliance with the workers because it threatens to destroy everything that he has worked for so many years. Eventually, the false Maria does mislead the workers into destroying the machines and the loss of power leads to a flood that wipes out their homes.Lang deals with one of his recurring themes mob violence. He explored mob violence in M (1931) with Peter Lorre and Fury (1936) with Spencer Tracy. Although Metropolis has been available as an inexpensive public domain film for over 40 years, Kino Video has released a splendid restored version that true movie lovers will genuinely appreciate for its clarity of picture.

","genre":"Drama, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"30 May 2009","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" As one of the earliest examples of cinematic science fiction fantasy, director Fritz Lang's Metropolis ranks as an unparalleled achievement in its size, scope, and vision. Forty years would elapse before Stanley Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey (1968) would rival Lang's epic spectacle about a troubled, dystopian society fractured along the fault lines of the economic inequality isolating the haves and the have-nots. Nevertheless, nothing could ever be said to surpass Metropolis as a film of beauty, majestic, and surrealism.The preamble encapsulates the film's timeless, universal message It has a moral that grows on the pillar of understanding. The mediator between the brain and muscle must be the heart.  Metropolis inspired generations of filmmakers with its use of state-of-the-art visual effects that transformed the science fiction film. Thea Von Harbou's saga about an evil robot is designed by a vengeful inventor to impersonate a flesh & blood female Christ figure and incite anarchy can clearly be traced as a source of inspiration to many contemporary sci-fi films and television shows, such as the Terminator franchise, Robocop franchise, Blade Runner, Logan's Run, The Fifth Element, and Battlestar Galactic. The Metropolis robot was not the first robot, but it was unmistakably the seminal one that sired a long line of cinematic robots. The famous transformation scene where the robot turns into a human foreshadows the Frankenstein franchise.Many detractors of Lang's visionary work&#x97;primarily noted sci-fi author H.G. Wells--derided it as shallow and his criticisms are not without substance. Indeed, the characters lack depth because they represent archetypes instead of individuals in a larger-than-life story. The spectacle, this Marxist chronicle of humanity at odds with itself over machinery, and the anarchy that emerges from this division makes Metropolis a memorable mediation about our flawed society, part sci-fi, part horror and a statement about the incompatibility polarity that comes about between those who control and those who are controlled. Again, von Harbou's theme re-echoes with greater intensity. The virtuous Maria would say that the head and the hands would need a mediator and the mediator would be the heart.

James Cameron's spectacularly-successful blockbuster, however bloated with its fictional central romance and modern-day framing device, is nonetheless a powerful and emotionally-exhausting recreation of the RMS Titanic's final desperate hours. Owing to its documentary- like approach, I hadn't quite expected 'A Night to Remember (1958)' to strike a comparable emotional chord, but it did. Indeed, everything that made Cameron's film such a compelling and memorable cinematic experience &#x96; the fear, anguish, desperation, courage, and cowardice of the ship's passengers &#x96; had already been achieved forty years earlier, and without the need for an entirely-fictionalised romance to overshadow the disaster itself. Perhaps the only additional theme explored by the 1997 'Titanic' is that of the British class system, approached only peripherally by the 1958 picture, which was released when films like 'Look Back in Anger (1958)' and 'Room at the Top (1959)' were only beginning to explore the theme.The sinking of the White Star Line's RMS Titanic on April 15, 1912 has long since seeped into popular folklore. It was the moment when Mankind attempted to assert his dominance over nature, and when Mother Nature decisively demonstrated that we'd never be impervious to her might and fury. A combination of human vanity, careless planning and plain bad luck contributed to the sinking of the great unsinkable ship, and the subsequent loss of 1517 passengers and crew. 'A Night to Remember' was the fifth film to depict the Titanic disaster, its most well-known predecessor being Jean Negulesco's 'Titanic (1953),' starring Clifton Webb and Barbara Stanwyck. In Roy War Baker's drama, a large cast of mostly unfamiliar actors, and the absence of any immediately identifiable characters, somehow doesn't detract from the film's emotional strength, perhaps because the basis in history keeps the tragedy's human toll in continual prominence. In fact, the film's wide scope, often encompassing small, inconsequential characters who nevertheless show remarkable courage in the face of death, brings home the enormity of the disaster.'A Night to Remember' brings a distinctly-British sensibility to the tragedy, starkly realistic and yet somehow tinged with an almost poetic romanticism. That such a mighty work of human engineering could so readily be toppled by nature seems absurd, almost surreal, and the film brilliantly captures this dreamlike sense. The uproar of the panicking passages as they jostle for seats on the lifeboats is eerily juxtaposed with images of the first-class dining rooms, where fully-prepared tables stand empty and untouched, perfectly normal but for the absence of patrons and the ever-so-imperceptible tilt of the floor. Emotion is found in the small, heartbreaking moments. A loving husband assures his family that its all an inconvenient precaution, all too aware that he'll never see them again; an old man holds a lost and nameless child to his chest as the ship descends beneath the water; Thomas Andrews, the ship's designer, desolately wanders the ship's deserted halls, the foundations overhead creaking like a pod of calling whales; the musicians valiantly keep playing their music.

Cuarón knows how to work space, he knows how to move around, he knows how to find or\/and create spaces that he can explore, moving around them, find the best view points. In these matters, he probably inherits Orson Welles' investigations of the days he mastered space exploration and architecture framing. That's where Cuarón's mind is centered, i think. Whereas Wenders explores in a pure way bi dimensional images, where Kubrick molds films around narrative constructions, Cuarón does it with space.Having said this, this specific film is not where he does it the more intensely. I didn't watch this when it came out, and now that i've seen it i've already seen Children of Men and the 3rd Harry Potter. Here he probably was more constrained and had less latitude to work his abilities. Yet there are moments, attached to spaces, which are pure visual pearls. So, work your mind in the scenes of the Lost Paradise house. Watch how that space is built to be explored, how big rooms exist to make it worthy for the camera to dance with the characters. Watch how the stairway which goes down to the fountain of the first kiss is there to allow the camera to follow characters as a pretext to exploit space. These moments in the stairway are specially Wellesian. The other space explored is the Hawke's studio in New York. The space is clear and not mysterious in the way we read it. In other words, you perceive it with a single frame, it is opened, and its composition is perfectly readable. But it is very interesting, the lighting and scale, and Cuarón uses it perfectly. I'm guessing this space is real, where the Lost Paradise is a set.These moments, which clearly were the most impressive in the film, to me, hang on a story. Borrowed from Dickens, the story has to do with the story itself. Characters exist are manipulators or manipulated (or both, in the case of Paltrow's character). It's a story about who is telling the story. At least in the cinematic construction (not the book's), characters exist to serve narrative construction, and i personally think that it is more effective, in cinema, that it goes like that. So we have to main narrators, but we are only aware of one, so is Hawke. That's the trick, it's clever and it certainly is effective, at least here.I don't like Ethan Hawke, i admit. I think he is untalented and, worse, he is arrogant in his performances. This means that he does nothing, but truly believes he is giving us something everlasting. Well, usually i'm put away from such performances (in the line of Freeman, Redford, latest Cruise...) but here, considering what his character does in the story, i have to admit he is a perfect cast.
