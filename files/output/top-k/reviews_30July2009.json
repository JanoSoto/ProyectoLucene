I went to go see Tarzan in theaters a month after its June release and I enjoyed it so much that I wanted to see it again! And now, ten years later, I am finally writing a review for another one of my favorite Disney movies. Tarzan is a story (like most other Disney films sitting on your shelves and mine) about a man and a beautiful woman who meet and fall in love. But, Tarzan is a man who was found by an ape named Kala (Glenn Close)and raised by her after his birth parents are killed by a vicious leopard named Sabor. After she rescues him from Sabor, she takes him in and Kerchak, the silverback leader of the apes (Lance Henriksen), does not accept him as his son. Soon he finds friendship from the likes of a comic ape named Terk (Rosie O'Donnell) and a nutty elephant named Tantor (Wayne Knight)who help him become King of the Jungle. After he faces off with Sabor and kills him, saving Kerchak's life, Kerchak starts to respect him more. Then, he discovers man is in the jungle. But, he finds out they look and talk just like him! Now, he finds companionship with the beautiful Jane(Minnie Driver)who will teach him human ways. Like in every story, there is a villain. The villain in this one is a greedy hunter named Clayton(Brian Blessed)who wants to hunt down and kill Tarzan's ape family. Tarzan has everything an animated movie should have great story, great music score, great characters,an amazing climax, and a valuable lesson that can be learned and applied in everyday life. I have a lot of movies on my shelf, and this is one that I own. If you haven't seen this yet, I encourage you to do so. My rating for Tarzan10\/10!

It's the first Star Trek movie I saw and I have to say it's still the best one in my eyes even after the first time I saw it 14 years ago. I love it!Unlike most of the other Star Trek movies, which depend upon prior knowledge of the franchise before viewing, this one can be seen by anyone new to it. Even those who dislike the Star Trek franchise still love this movie as a sci-fi action movie in its own right as I found out when I was reading through the comments.Without giving away spoilers, I can tell everyone that this is one of the few movies I've ever seen where almost every scene is riveting and has some significance. Scenes of literal edge-of-your-seat suspense are offset by emotionally-moving and thought-provoking moments. The viewer is made to feel a variety of emotions including fear, love, laughter, sadness, regret, grief and for some even unbearable levels of tension. It is also perhaps the only sci-fi movie to directly question science in a very wide context and make us all wonder about the dangers of science evolving too far and possibly leading to too much power being placed in the wrong hands.Unsurprisingly, this movie was a box office hit unlike its predecessor, STAR TREK THE MOTION PICTURE, which was a massive flop.In an unusual turn of events for a sequel, this one disregards its predecessor to bring to the audience a very different story.I will sum up the plot of the movie, with those unfamiliar with the Star Trek franchise in mind - a space ship (the USS Reliant) carrying out a scientific investigation accidentally arrive on a planet inhabited by a genetically-engineered madman named Khan and his followers who were marooned there 15 years ago by the then Captain James T. Kirk of the USS Enterprise. Khan is obsessed with getting revenge on the newly promoted Admiral Kirk and decides to hi-jack the Reliant to hunt him down in what culminates in a terrific cat-and-mouse chase in space.The acting is top-notch across the board. The actors give performances that truly invite us in to their character's feelings.For those familiar with the Star Trek franchise, I can confirm that the familiar faces from the original series are all here - Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Scotty, Chekov, Sulu and Uhura. They are put into situations that not only capture the heart and soul of the TV series, but also show you how their lives have evolved in the 15 years or so difference with the timeline.A new character, Saavik, a naive vulcan lieutenant, played perfectly by Kirstie Alley, adds enjoyment to the experience. She has plenty of screen time, looks and acts incredibly sexy, takes part in some terrific scenes and has an important purpose to the emotional elements of the movie. Why she has never had the opportunity to appear in anything as good as this again is totally beyond me. And in my opinion her character should have been made a permanent addition to the original crew for the remainder of their movies in the series.Khan, who featured in an episode of the original series, is once again played by Ricardo Montalban. Unlike most villains in the science fiction or action genres, Khan is genuinely menacing through his combination of sheer cunningness, quick mind and unpredictable anger. He's easily the greatest villain ever established by the Star Trek franchise. Every scene he's in is a true joy to watch and the movie is worth seeing just to witness Ricardo Montalban's captivating performance.William Shatner deserves special recognition because he gives what is easily his finest performance as Kirk. He portrays Kirk as someone well into middle-age, sitting behind a desk in a boring job when he'd rather be back flying around the galaxy. His performance was one of the most emotionally touching I've ever seen in a movie and is certainly enough to silence those who unjustly claim his acting is hammy.The action scenes in the movie are truly suspenseful in the edge-of-your-seat sense. Unlike the series, some boundaries are removed in this movie. There are no crewmen wearing red sweaters who fans of the series would reasonably expect to see killed. No one is safe from death. Khan's thirst for revenge is truly merciless and the producers of the movie really brought this to life as anyone seeing the final half hour of the movie will find out.The movie demonstrates clear evidence of meticulous planning in regard to scripting. Some truly great one-liners are delivered here that will stay forever in the memories of fans.The producers do an excellent job of re-using some of the best aspects of the first movie, including the sets for the starships, some costumes and footage of the Enterprise leaving spacedock. This enabled this movie to be produced on a more efficient budget without making the $10 million or so budget seem anywhere near as low as it was.To summarise, STAR TREK THE WRATH OF KHAN is a flawless piece of science fiction entertainment that can be enjoyed whether you're a fan of the franchise or not. I recommend this for anyone who enjoys sci-fi action movies.

It seems most people just hated this movie. The simple explanation for this is that the nature of the movie is very dark and Director Crowe does a wonderful job of presenting an intellectual psychological masterpiece that just seems on first viewing to loose the average viewer.Watch this movie a second time, sometimes even a third time and you will pick up on all those hidden little details, those delightfully subtle clues and even some of the not so subtle clues to understand what is happening.On the second view you learn to appreciate the story of this movie which is a journey through the materialistic, egocentric condition that has been so linked to the American dream.

I'm not sure why. Perhaps it's to put my two cents in and to share what a 36-year old first time watcher but movie aficionado thinks about it. I was amazed it was made in 1941. It's in black and white but has modern original cinematography. It was revolutionary back then and I still regard it as original today. The plays of shadows and lights, who is lit up or not, and how, are not only beautiful but are evocative and serve storyline purposes. The transitions from scene to scene, backgrounds and foregrounds old and new fading out or in, are amazingly well done. Even today, you rarely see anything as artistic as this. The flashbacks and flash-forwards are very cleverly done (witness the diner table scene between Kane and his wife going from early twenties to middle age). The makeup in Kane is for the most part positively astounding and ages the characters better than most modern films. The camera angles are mostly unconventional, playing often with perspective for story purposes (notice Kane smaller in the background during bad moments or bigger than life when things go well). There are quite a few shots (Kane standing underneath a giant poster of himself for one) that are quite memorable and still powerful. I could go on but technically this movie is a marvel even today.Despite the unconventional story structure, you never get lost, although you might be temporarily confused, and it makes the whole storyline very engaging. It follows the trials and tribulations of a very rich and influential newspaper mogul from childhood to his death but not in chronological order. As a matter of fact, the film starts with the death of Kane, followed by a newsreel (like in old World War II screenings) recapping his whole life and then followed by an investigation into Rosebud, his mysterious last word. It's inspired by the life of real newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst who tried his very best to destroy this movie... literally. There are lots of creative liberties taken but if you study the background, you will notice the similarities. It's a great story extremely well told. You might not care about Kane but he's certainly a rich, complex and fascinating character. He's played by the director Orson Welles and he shows a wide range of emotions and acts differently according to age, not just in demeanor but physically. The other actors, most of them newcomers to cinema, are very fine although a few succumb, including Welles sometimes, to overacting just a tad (they were mostly theater actors which would explain the theatrics I suppose). On first viewing, I found the mistress of Kane particularly annoying and badly acted to the point of being grating but on second thought, I think she was supposed to be that way, a bit of a superficial simple floozy.Overall, I was impressed, despite high expectations, at how original, enjoyable and artistic Citizen Kane remains in 2009. It might not be one of my favorite films, nor would I consider it the best film of all time but I think it still appeals to modern sensibilities and deserves its reputation as a masterpiece. I highly recommend finding a copy of your own, preferably with the great commentary track by the famous critic Roger Ebert (Kane being his favorite film of all time) and with the illuminating documentary about the Battle of Citizen Kane showing the conflict between director\/main actor Orson Welles and Kane's inspiration Hearst, as well as their biographies.Rating 9 out of 10 (not a 10 because I wasn't moved or awed as much as a few other select films) ","genre":null},{"date":"30 July 2009","score":"7 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":" Why another review of Citizen Kane, a movie that made its mark in cinema history and is often regarded as the best film of all time?

Like STAR TREK THE WRATH OF KHAN, this movie can also be enjoyed by both those familiar to the Star Trek franchise and those new to it. Reading through the comments, I have noted comments from people who enjoyed it as a sci-fi action movie in its own right.I will sum up the plot with those unfamiliar with Star Trek in mind - an alien race known as the Borg apathetic to individuality go back more than 300 years in time to attack Earth, colonise it and absorb its inhabitants into its collective. Captain Picard of the USS Enterprise follows the Borg back to Earth to stop their plans.This very simple plot line brings an energetic story filled with virtually non-stop shoot-em-up action. Unlike most action movies, however, the antagonist is far more menacing. The Borg have no concept of individuality. It cannot be reasoned with. Killing one Borg barely has the impact of, say, removing one blood cell from a human body. The Borg in this movie are far more menacing than they were in the TV series.For those familiar with the Star Trek franchise, I can confirm that all the familiar faces from the crew in the THE NEXT GENERATION series all appear here - Picard, Riker, Data, Geordi, Worf, Dr Crusher and Troi.The movie represents a massive transformation from its predecessor, STAR TREK GENERATIONS. For the first time we witness many members of the TNG crew behave or tempted to behave out-of-character due to the scale of the situation they find themselves in. Without giving away spoilers, I can state that characters in this movie face the prospect of having to turn against one another.The acting across the board is top-notch. The actors' performances are so captivating that they genuinely invite the audience to share the feelings of their characters.Patrick Stewart deserves special mention because he faces the greatest acting challenge - reprising his role as a character he played for 7 years in the TV series and a prior movie - now having to play the said character, Captain Picard, in a very different manner. The Captain Picard of this movie is not the calm diplomat from the TV series, he is someone with anger-fuelled determination to get revenge on the Borg, who once altered his biology so that he became part of their collective for a short time. His performance has to be seen to be believed and is enough to silence critics who claim he is unable to play a hero.Alice Krige gives what is perhaps the best performance of her career as the Borg Queen. Her performance provides a perfect distraction from the major plothole - the existence of a head of the Borg collective. The Borg collective communicates as one voice with each drone being the same. So it could not feasibly have a single leader. When you see Alice Krige in action, however, you will find it easy to suspend your disbelief.James Cromwell has fun playing Zephram Cochrane, the inventor of the warp drive referenced all through the franchise. For those unfamiliar with Star Trek, the warp drive is a component able to make starship engines travel at hyper speeds. I found the Zephram Cochrane in this movie much more exciting to watch than the bland version played by Glenn Corbett in an episode of the original series.The real drawback with regards to the acting is Alfre Woodard. She was not a convincing lover or protégé for Picard and I couldn't help but wonder if she was drafted in as a replacement for Whoopi Goldberg. For those unfamiliar with the franchise, Whoopi Goldberg played a character named Guinan in the TNG series. She acted as a protégé ready to give wise words of advice to many crew members on the ship, including Picard.Jonathan Frakes shows that he is just as good behind the camera as he is in front of it. His direction brings a great science-fiction story to life that is genuinely thought-provoking, emotionally moving and highly entertaining. In my opinion, he should have been nominated for an Oscar for Best Direction for his work on this movie.The new starship Enterprise-E seems very dark and claustrophobic compared to the seemingly vast, bright and colourful Enterprise-D from the TV series and the previous movie. However, the Enterprise-E provides a perfect backdrop for the action to take place since its feel fits the tone of the movie perfectly. A wise decision was made to keep the bulk of the action on the ship rather than on Earth. Having said that, the events depicted on Earth help to offset the tension and allowing the audience to take a quick breath before being thrust back in again. The mix of light and dark works like a charm.To summarise, STAR TREK FIRST CONTACT is a first-rate entry into the Star Trek series of movies that can be enjoyed by Star Trek fans and newcomers to Star Trek alike.

The Captain Picard of this movie is not the calm diplomat from the TV series, he is someone with anger-fuelled determination to get revenge on the Borg, who once altered his biology so that he became part of their collective for a short time. His performance has to be seen to be believed and is enough to silence critics who claim he is unable to play a hero.Alice Krige gives what is perhaps the best performance of her career as the Borg Queen. Her performance provides a perfect distraction from the major plothole - the existence of a head of the Borg collective. The Borg collective communicates as one voice with each drone being the same. So it could not feasibly have a single leader. When you see Alice Krige in action, however, you will find it easy to suspend your disbelief.James Cromwell has fun playing Zephram Cochrane, the inventor of the warp drive referenced all through the franchise. For those unfamiliar with Star Trek, the warp drive is a component able to make starship engines travel at hyper speeds. I found the Zephram Cochrane in this movie much more exciting to watch than the bland version played by Glenn Corbett in an episode of the original series.The real drawback with regards to the acting is Alfre Woodard. She was not a convincing lover or protégé for Picard and I couldn't help but wonder if she was drafted in as a replacement for Whoopi Goldberg. For those unfamiliar with the franchise, Whoopi Goldberg played a character named Guinan in the TNG series. She acted as a protégé ready to give wise words of advice to many crew members on the ship, including Picard.Jonathan Frakes shows that he is just as good behind the camera as he is in front of it. His direction brings a great science-fiction story to life that is genuinely thought-provoking, emotionally moving and highly entertaining. In my opinion, he should have been nominated for an Oscar for Best Direction for his work on this movie.The new starship Enterprise-E seems very dark and claustrophobic compared to the seemingly vast, bright and colourful Enterprise-D from the TV series and the previous movie. However, the Enterprise-E provides a perfect backdrop for the action to take place since its feel fits the tone of the movie perfectly. A wise decision was made to keep the bulk of the action on the ship rather than on Earth. Having said that, the events depicted on Earth help to offset the tension and allowing the audience to take a quick breath before being thrust back in again. The mix of light and dark works like a charm.To summarise, STAR TREK FIRST CONTACT is a first-rate entry into the Star Trek series of movies that can be enjoyed by Star Trek fans and newcomers to Star Trek alike. I highly recommend this for anyone who enjoys sci-fi action movies.

Although it deviates from the one-location danger scenario of the first two films, deciding to take a crazy hell-bent ride around New York City, it brings the winning elements that disappeared in Die Hard 2 and brings them back while adding bigger action and suspense.After giving up control of the director's seat to Renny Harlin for the Die Hard 2 in order to make The Hunt for Red October, McTiernan, couldn't have been pleased to see the direction the franchise was going and it must've contributed to his decision to produce Die Hard With a Vengeance almost five years later. It's a good thing, because if a third Die Hard had been greenlit by anyone else, the results probably wouldn't have been the same.Taken from a Jonathan Hensleigh script that was once it's own film called Simon Says and changed to fit the character of rebellious cop hero John McClane (Willis), With a Vengeance definitely feels like its own film. A few elements are carried over, such as the villain is the brother of first movie baddie Hans Gruber, whose name is Simon (Jeremy Irons), but the premise is unique to the franchise. Instead of one location like the tower in the first and the airport in the second, With a Vengeance makes New York City its playground and challenges McClane with riddles and time trials to avoid civilian casualties. It's different for the series, but Hensleigh works in McClane nicely and even gives him a bad-ass buddy in Samuel L. Jackson, who plays Zeus Carver, a Harlem electrician that gets dragged into McClane's mess and accuses everyone of being crazy Pulp Fiction-style.Most important is the return of a distinct antagonist. Die Hard 2 did not have a strong villain and McClane's peril did not seem as pressing. If cinema has learned any lesson from the James Bond franchise, it's don't let your antagonist go faceless. With a Vengeance learns this lesson and insures itself by making this villain related to the one in the first film. Irons is great. Not Alan Rickman great, but great.With a Vengeance is full of exciting action sequences from taxi drives through central park (on the grass, that is) to an explosion in the subway. The riddle-me-this thriller does seem forced, but there's certainly no lack of excitement and the twist halfway through makes it all well worth it.The only thing to dislike about the movie is it's harsh confrontation of racism. Jackson plays this white-wary black man who makes everything about race. The Lethal Weapon series has always been fine just pairing a white and black cop, but the script awkwardly forces this racial dialogue into With a Vengeance instead of making the tension between McClane and Carver just natural personality clash.But it's a big upgrade from Die Hard 2, and for the other fans disappointed with the sequel, it apologizes for that quite well. I suppose Die Hard 'purists' who wouldn't approve of McClane having a partner in this movie or its riddle-oriented structure might not enjoy it as much of the original, but on the entertainment scale, it's easily on par.

Although it deviates from the one-location danger scenario of the first two films, deciding to take a crazy hell-bent ride around New York City, it brings the winning elements that disappeared in Die Hard 2 and brings them back while adding bigger action and suspense.After giving up control of the director's seat to Renny Harlin for the Die Hard 2 in order to make The Hunt for Red October, McTiernan, couldn't have been pleased to see the direction the franchise was going and it must've contributed to his decision to produce Die Hard With a Vengeance almost five years later. It's a good thing, because if a third Die Hard had been greenlit by anyone else, the results probably wouldn't have been the same.Taken from a Jonathan Hensleigh script that was once it's own film called Simon Says and changed to fit the character of rebellious cop hero John McClane (Willis), With a Vengeance definitely feels like its own film. A few elements are carried over, such as the villain is the brother of first movie baddie Hans Gruber, whose name is Simon (Jeremy Irons), but the premise is unique to the franchise. Instead of one location like the tower in the first and the airport in the second, With a Vengeance makes New York City its playground and challenges McClane with riddles and time trials to avoid civilian casualties. It's different for the series, but Hensleigh works in McClane nicely and even gives him a bad-ass buddy in Samuel L. Jackson, who plays Zeus Carver, a Harlem electrician that gets dragged into McClane's mess and accuses everyone of being crazy Pulp Fiction-style.Most important is the return of a distinct antagonist. Die Hard 2 did not have a strong villain and McClane's peril did not seem as pressing. If cinema has learned any lesson from the James Bond franchise, it's don't let your antagonist go faceless. With a Vengeance learns this lesson and insures itself by making this villain related to the one in the first film. Irons is great. Not Alan Rickman great, but great.With a Vengeance is full of exciting action sequences from taxi drives through central park (on the grass, that is) to an explosion in the subway. The riddle-me-this thriller does seem forced, but there's certainly no lack of excitement and the twist halfway through makes it all well worth it.The only thing to dislike about the movie is it's harsh confrontation of racism. Jackson plays this white-wary black man who makes everything about race. The Lethal Weapon series has always been fine just pairing a white and black cop, but the script awkwardly forces this racial dialogue into With a Vengeance instead of making the tension between McClane and Carver just natural personality clash.But it's a big upgrade from Die Hard 2, and for the other fans disappointed with the sequel, it apologizes for that quite well. I suppose Die Hard 'purists' who wouldn't approve of McClane having a partner in this movie or its riddle-oriented structure might not enjoy it as much of the original, but on the entertainment scale, it's easily on par.

However, it is noteworthy as being the one and only film Cary Grant ever made in his native England for an English Studio.Grant plays Ernest Bliss, a wealthy London playboy with nothing to do but drink martini's in his posh west end club and wine and dine the female socialites of his class. Amazingly, he's still not a happy man, he's restless and short tempered and not knowing why, he visits the Harley Street Offices of Doctor Sir James Alroyd. (Peter Gawthorne). Sir James however, not only has his Harley Street practice, but is a great philanthropist who also helps the poorer people from the East End over come their ailments for little or no payment, and cannot disguise his visible contempt for Bliss.After examining Bliss he delivers his diagnosis to the shocked playboy, which turns out to be nothing more than a chronic case of boredom. He's bored because he's been spoilt and pampered all of his life without ever having to do a single thing for himself and hasn't anything constructive to do but live out his days spending his inheritance. Bliss in an attempt to prove there is more to him than what Sir James has said, bets him £50'000 that he can make an honest living for a whole year without touching any of his money for his own benefit.Incognito, Bliss sets off to the East End in an old suit and just enough money for the tube fare, but soon realises that his 'quest' is not as easy as he first thought. However, he also realises the strength and kindheartedness of the working classes. He's touched by the generosity of these people, good people who will give you what they have even though they haven't that much to give. Convinced that he is not using his money for HIS own benefit as his deal with Sir James stipulated, Bliss begins to use his inheritance to help these people out of certain situations, thus changing their lives for the better.As I mentioned earlier, it's not a great film but it's heart is certainly in the right place. and the movie is riddled with great and much missed British character actors\/actresses of the 1930's and '40's. American Actress Mary Brian plays Frances Clayton, Grant's love interest.It such a shame that the movie runs just a little over an hour and has obviously been cut to shreds by a crazed studio editor somewhere, because there is\/was an 80 minute print of this movie available at one time or another. So my 'amazing quest' is now to hunt down this elusive version if it still exists which sadly I doubt, as Empire Film Studios were never a major player in British movie making before or after the war. It's a genuine possibility that the original 80 minute print was destroyed in the blitz with only the 61 minute USA version still in existence. who knows?.Enjoy!!!

Both deliver the necessary components of teenage morale fibre to give the film a feisty chemistry without diving too much into the conventional side of the romance genre. Inevitably there is a formula that follows the usual guidelines but above all other modern day romantic comedies this is a high contender as it is dark and significantly likable.The beginning shows us Cameron, the new student who gets shown the ropes by the humorous David Krumholtz and when we look at today's modern stereotypes, its quite interesting to see the way they were ten years ago. David's Michael shows us the list of the groups the teenagers form, from the geeks to the models and so forth. It's no Mean Girls as the stereotyping is settled relatively quickly as the plot moves up a gear.The film really gets going when we see Cameron's lust towards Bianca and therein lays the complications. The bizarre implication of the sisters' dad deciding the rule if one dates then the other can date is initially strange but this opens up a can of rivalry with a thirst for emotional battles that are spicy with a strong dexterity of drama and equal comic value that says a lot for the plot's themes.This is a film very much about rivalry and bitterness between people. From Patrick's (Ledger) feud with Joey (Andrew Keegan) and the sister's constant war of words this film justifies the genre and is plentiful to deal the drama when necessary.There are obviously numerous teenage romantic comedies out there so you may wonder what this one has to offer say over American Pie or Cruel Intentions? Well unlike American Pie this has humour in the normal sense, one liners and funny spurts of craziness, from the motorbike on the hill to the drawing on the face. There is no crude violation of human nature here it is all down to earth. Like cruel intentions, this has a cool soundtrack with modern collection of pop songs adding spice with a more electric and vibrant motive. Not to mention Heath Ledger's I love you baby singing scene is one of the coolest romantic sequences to grace the screens for teens.This film is also very well equipped with character establishment. Ledger's mysterious presence in the early stages is well equipped with bizarre rumours but he learns the value of honesty as he goes on whilst Kat learns that everyone isn't fighting against her. Stiles is well controlled to portray the intelligent opinionated mind of her protagonist.
