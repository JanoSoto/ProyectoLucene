Personally I like Return to Oz a lot better than this film. I can't stand musicals personally and this is full of musicals. I have an 8 month old daughter and when she gets older I am going to introduce her to Return to Oz instead of this film. I think she would relate and like the 2nd one a lot better than this. Honestly if it was not for the musicals this movie would get an 8 or 9 easily! The actors\/actresses are great in this film which make it the classic it is. I do enjoy the story of the film and the characters but it just isn't up to par with the sequel in terms of fantasy. The 2nd one is so much darker than this which makes it much different in terms of what I like to watch. If you have not seen this movie you have to watch it but go rent or buy both films. I am sure your kids would like Return to Oz better than this one.j.d. & the dark empire ","genre":null},{"date":"12 August 2010","score":"3 out of 20 people found the following review useful","review":" OK the reason I gave this film 3\/10 is because its not as good as the original books.

It's anachronistic. However, since 1977's Star wars movie soon became the highest grossing movie of all time, it's perhaps unsurprising that this Bond film borrowed some ideas from it...with regard to weapons and setting.Bond formula Exotic settings - U.S.A, Venice, Rio de Janeiro and...outer space! Plot - A space shuttle manufactured by Sir Hugo Drax's Drax Industries disappears. The pre-title sequence shows what happened here. That sequence is what made me refer to this movie as Thunderball in space in my header...there is an equivalent sequence to this in Sean Connery's turn as Bond in You only live twice.Anyway, Bond must investigate the circumstances of the shuttle's disappearance.Gun barrel sequence...check.Pre-title sequence - The greatest to this point, in my view...and quite possibly the best ever in the franchise. It really defies belief! Main title theme song - One of the great elements of Sean Connery's incarnation as James Bond was the great Shirley Bassey singing the theme song to some of his movies. Le grande fromage returns for one last great song...perhaps her best in the series. It's beautiful. Hal David wrote the lyrics.Q - Usually not much to say about the man, as I don't usually include what technology he provides to Bond in my reviews. However, I must say that Q's line right near the end of the movie is killer! He usually doesn't get that sort of quality dialogue!Silly female names - Dr. Holly Goodhead work for you? Sexism - Check. Bond is paternalistic here, at times. There is a good, awkward moment between Bond and Goodhead when they first meet. She has some good lines to use on him! Bit of a war of the sexes here.Wine snobbery - Check. Bond says Bollinger. If it's '69, you were expecting me!. Hmm, seem to recall reading somewhere that that the wines that Bond values in the movies aren't really that well regarded by real wine connoisseurs! End teaser...check.Things of interest * Sir Hugo Drax is one of the better Bond characters...he has some marvellous lines to Bond...like the one about Britain's one indisputable great contribution to Western society...afternoon tea! Ouch! * Animal lovers take note...some pheasants are shot in this movie as part of game hunting...but it's OK...Bond was shooting them in self-defence! * If by this movie you can't spot the product placement, you really must get your eyesight checked! * Bond comes across as a little bit creepy at times in this movie...sort of a stalker...which isn't really very spy-ish. Other aspects of his spy 'technique' seem to leave a little to be desired too! * Not that Connery's Bond films were never silly at times, but here the comic book aspects are magnified and amplified...Q Division is in hyper-drive and Jaws is more of a comic book creation here...listen for the aural hint that Jaw's teeth aren't the only things made of metal on his body! * General Gogol returns in this movie.Notes to self - * big words I do not understand...bolas\/vassar funambulists.* Is this true?...the orchidea nigra was worshipped once? Stuff about sterility...caused by this plant? * re gravity...20g is apparently fatal. 3g is what astronauts launching into space experience. At 7g most people pass out. Bond experiences at least 14g.
