The beginning of the movie makes you think you are in for a treat, as the plot of the movie begins to reveal itself, leaving you to fill out the blanks.And everything looks well made, from the surroundings to the equipment people use, as the story belongs to the future. The movie takes a wrong turn (i call it the Hollywood turn) when it starts to act like an action movie, with really incredible stunts and a lot of computer-animated scenes.Don't get me wrong, it all looks very nice, but since i am a very realistic person it just seemed too incredible to me.The idea of the movie is good, and you can really relate to it (well at least i can), the thing that bothered me most was, it could have been better...especially the ending where the city is actually on Mars.The actors, Arnold, Sharon, were solid, nothing special but also nothing wrong, Paul, the director, has his own style, it is really hard to describe, but the actions scenes are not complete, meaning you might see two guys on the ground at one point and then in the next scene they are both standing up and fighting, and in the following scene they are doing something else, so it looks a bit different from what i am used to, but it doesn't make the movie look bad (or worse). All in all, a solid entertaining movie, developing a very modern and soon-to-be-problematic topic.

Like Dracula, this movie is very stripped down. Right at the beginning, Dr. Frankenstein is in the thick of working on his experiment, along with his hunchback servant Fritz (Dwight Frye, who doesn't have to waste any time being a nimrod straight man this time around). Earlier, I listed the Frankenstein monster as the fifth major villain to hit the screen in this year (after Caesar Enrico Bandeli, Tom Powers, Dracula, and Hans Beckert). It occurred to me while watching that perhaps the villain isn't the monster, but is actually the doctor, played by Colin Clive, who carries the first half of the movie with his performance. I think I'm going to let it be Boris Karloff's monster, who carries the movie through to its home stretch; I look forward to the sequels later on. It is, of course, impossible to watch this film today without thinking about Young Frankenstein (and I'm sure the same is true of a number of the sequels). Some of the movie is a bit dated, though the scene where the monster tosses little Maria into the pond is still chilling. Talk about dated, there's a scene late in the film that I'm sure was very scary in 1931, but I found extremely funny the Monster sneaks into Elizabeth's room, and there's about 20 seconds where she's unaware of his presence as a modern audience screams LOOK BEHIND YOU! HE'S RIGHT THERE! the way we do in all silly horror films these days. Then when she notices him, he goes in for the kill; the camera cuts to a close-up, and the Monster's lip curls up as he growls like Bob Hope. That was weird.KEVIN Here we have the fifth and final villain of 1931, but it's up for debate whether it is Dr. Frankenstein (Colin Clive) or his Monster (Boris Karloff). Most of the horror in this movie has become terribly cheesy, but Karloff's performance is still scary as hell. When he first lumbers in, he doesn't seem fully human or truly alive. His face has become the standard for Frankenstein's monster, yet even now it still invokes such uneasiness. Colin Clive's titular doctor is also surprisingly creepy, with his escalating madness bringing out a performance almost as unforgettable as the Monster. This film holds up much better than Dracula. There's much more on screen violence, and the characters aren't as idiotic. One of the unique qualities about this version of the story is the way it starts in the middle. In the very first scene we find Dr. Frankenstein and his assistant Fritz (Dwight Frye, back again!) digging up another corpse for their experiments. The advantage of this kind of storytelling is that it adds mystery to the doctor's actions right as the film begins. If you don't know the story, you're not sure what he's up to, but you know it's not good. It also allows us to get right into the action. The disadvantage of doing this is that we don't get a clear picture of who Frankenstein was before he became obsessed with playing god and cheating death.Last film The Champ (1931). Next film Mata Hari (1931).
