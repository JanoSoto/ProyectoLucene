The interesting thing about this movie is not its unique and stark setting, or the strange match of its two protagonists, but the way the film manages to paint a metaphorical portrait of love and all the slings and arrows that go with it -- and it does so almost wordlessly.  The resulting film is curiously pure, strange, and unforgettable.Even the first act, which is more or less a conventional portrait of two men lost in the desert in Napoleonic times -- has a richness and poignancy (one man, an artist, drinks his paints in thirsty desperation, and the image of his paint-stained lips is haunting).But ultimately this is a movie about love, a sensitively told fable, gorgeously photographed, about a man who is first mysteriously protected by -- and then drawn to -- a wild she-leopard, and of the way the leopard begins to draw him into her world.  The movie isn't so much about men vs. leopards (or men with leopards! tabloid-style -- the movie stops short of portraying the affection between the two in the biblical sense, although there is some ambiguity there) as it is about the nature of love itself. The film paints some fresh, unsettling, and sometimes amusing portraits of the things people do when they're in love -- all the way down to the spitefulness and jealousy that come into play when that love is threatened.By the end of the film, the story has become almost Shakespearean in its depth and richness as the plot plays out to its haunting end.  At this point, the roles have almost reversed -- the man has become wild and catlike, and the she-leopard seems strikingly human and thoughtful in her expressions and her actions.  The film is the first I've ever seen which actually raises some uncomfortable and ultimately fascinating questions about the possibility of a human falling in love with an animal -- and it explores these questions gracefully and without sensationalism.All in all, Passion in the Desert was an exquisite film that really moved me -- the performances, both human and animal, are breathtaking and frankly amazed me, and the cinematography and music are glorious.  (Too bad there aren't animal Oscars -- the she-leopard in this film really gives an incredible performance.)  Bottom Line  If you're looking for something off the beaten path (no pun intended), this film's a keeper.

This is a classic example of a movie that had almost no thought put into its plot. It is a series of fights, interrupted from time to time with scenes of dialogue that raise more questions than they answer.The 13th Warrior begins with a scene of Ambassador Ahmet (who existed in real life) headed north after being sent away so he won't fool around with the king's wife. He and his small retinue bump into a passing Viking gang, and for reasons never explained Ahmet must join a band of 13 Vikings in a mission to help a semi-feudal village that is under attack. Even more odd is Ahmet's decision to join the Vikings. He already has a mission, and doesn't seem to be under any duress. Even a throw-away line along the lines of, I decided to go, so I could learn more about these North People who I will need to understand as ambassador would have helped. Along the way Ahmet learns how to speak the Viking language by, apparently, watching the Vikings talk. Never are we shown a Viking saying a word and tying it to an item, so that an observer might be able to attach meaning to the words. Yet somehow our hero learns the language. What are the odds of that?At this point The 13th Warrior becomes a sort of a Viking Seven Samauri, with our Viking heroes gathering the village people (the serfs, not the disco group, though if *those* Village People appeared it would not have surprised me) to defend the town against a band of cannibals who are (again) never fully explained.During the ensuring battle scenes, there is an attempt to show a juxtaposition between the culture of Ahmet the Muslum and Rennaisance Man and that of the crude but effective Vikings. For example, Ahmet has trouble wielding a Viking broadsword but once he has a curved scimitar made to order he is ready to rock (of course, later, when the band sorties on a mission to attack the cannibals, Ahmet has a Viking broadsword tied to his back and the scimitar is nowhere in sight). Also, just before a big battle, Ahmet suddenly drops to his knees to pray as Muslins do five times a day (though we never see him do it at any other time). Anyway, you can *almost* feel the threads of a plot here revolving around Ahmet as an observer of another culture, but it never is clear nor develops (just like the rest of the movie).There are many instances where events make no sense. The cannibal tribe at one point early on seem to have kicked the Vikings' butts and are burning the village, then withdraw at the sound of a horn for no apparent reason. It just means they have to attack again later, after the village has time to recover a bit. There also seems to be some voodoo involved in that the Vikings (and Ahmet, for a little while) don't know if the cannibals are men or spirits. It's unclear why there is any doubt, since the cannibals look like guys with animal headdresses and fall when they are stabbed. And throughout the movie it appears that the odds are something like 20 or 30 to 1 against the Vikings (and the cannibals are on horses!), yet somehow we have a happy ending.The movie *tries* to draw on a theme of honor and courage. The Viking leader is noble and fights until he can no longer fight. But that theme is underminded by the numerous ploy holes. Why should we care about these people and what they fight for? Why are there only 13? Why do the cannibals attack? How did this start? Without answers to basic questions (and no clear indication of a moral cause), the idea of honor falls flat.I cannot believe the average rating for this movie is 6.2. We gave it a 2.

I saw it for the first time last night, luckily I taped it, and I watched it again three times today.In the beginning we are introduced a bunch of character, although only one of them will remain in the picture. That is, of course Vanessa, played by Reese Witherspoon (Election, Pleasantville), who is so adorable I could just lay down and die. Then there's her mother, played by Amanda Plummer (God's Army, Pulp Fiction), her stepfather Michael T.

This is one reason I love Freeway so much the supporting actors. We also bump in to two of my personal favorites, Alanna Ubach (Clockwatchers, Denise Calls Up), and Brittany Murphy (Clueless, Girl, Interrupted). The latter being absolutely flawless as a smack-abusing, paint-sniffing, lesbian weirdo. Plus, they're both really hot. Which is not a disadvantage in any way.

She looks EXACTLY like Little Red Riding Hood did in the cartoon she and her stepfather were watching earlier.

Maybe that's why many good movies have been set in submarines.  No personal space, no way to see the surrounding dangers, nowhere to escape, and constantly fearful of a torpedo, a depth charge, or a mechanical breakdown.  Perfect opportunities for good film-making.  See Das Boot (1981), The Hunt for Red October (1990), Crimson Tide (1995), or The Enemy Below (1957) to prove my point.  Those are all excellent films that I personally recommend.Now Writer\/Director Jonathan Mostow (1997's Breakdown) brings us U-571, but unfortunately it's not in the league of those films.  It's a pretty good movie, but nothing more than that.  It has intensity, drama, and action, but I found myself constantly thinking that each of the above-mentioned films had already done it......better.  Most of the characters were poorly developed, so I ended up as a detached observer rather than really caring for the men onboard U-571.  As a result, I was interesting in the dramatic scenes, but not in a 'white knuckle' sort of way.  And that's what makes a great action film--submarine or no submarine.McConaughey and Keitel are very solid in the two best-written roles. McConaughey has cooled off since his big hot streak in 1996 and 1997 (Lone Star, A Time To Kill, Contact, and Amistad), but he's in good form here.  Keitel's Klough reminds me of Sean Connery's role in The Untouchables--the grizzled veteran instructing\/teaching the higher-ranking but much younger and less experienced Tyler.  Their conversations are the highlights of the non-action scenes.  The other roles are quite thankless--a character will shine for a moment, then you won't see him for a long time. Or he'll die.  Suffering the most is well-known actor Bill Paxton (A Simple Plan, Twister, Apollo 13).  His lines are so cheesy and stereotypical that I found myself knowing what he was going to say before he opened his mouth!I don't mind suspending disbelief for 2 hours and accepting that these men (and this ship) could do these things.  But most of the characters are paper thin, and I knew within the first few minutes whether each one would live or die.  No surprises at all!  The action scenes are fairly well-done, but nothing I hadn't seen before.  The depth charge scenes are very intense, but by the third time they lose most of their drama.  The we're in a sub we've never seen before....how do we operate it? was done better in The Hunt for Red October.  The we're sinking and the hull is about to be crushed was done better in Crimson Tide.  And the overall we're trapped in a leaky WW2 U-boat with enemies all around us was done MUCH better in Das Boot.If you're looking to grab some popcorn and be entertained for 2 hours, you could do MUCH worse than U-571.  It will entertain you, but you'll come away wishing that it had delivered more bang for your bucks.

But most of the characters are paper thin, and I knew within the first few minutes whether each one would live or die.  No surprises at all!  The action scenes are fairly well-done, but nothing I hadn't seen before.  The depth charge scenes are very intense, but by the third time they lose most of their drama.  The we're in a sub we've never seen before....how do we operate it? was done better in The Hunt for Red October.  The we're sinking and the hull is about to be crushed was done better in Crimson Tide.  And the overall we're trapped in a leaky WW2 U-boat with enemies all around us was done MUCH better in Das Boot.If you're looking to grab some popcorn and be entertained for 2 hours, you could do MUCH worse than U-571.  It will entertain you, but you'll come away wishing that it had delivered more bang for your bucks. ","genre":"Action, War"},{"date":"1 May 2000","score":"","review":"  Minor spoilers. U-571 could have been a great movie. It has suspense, drama, action, and thrills. However, it lacks heart and humor. The truly perplexing reality is that humor and emotion were intertwined with the suspense in the script, yet did not find their way into the film. I have read what was meant to be and went into the theater with expectations that were unfulfilled. Where was the relationship between Andy Tyler and Pete Emmett? For that matter, where was Pete Emmett? In the book Lt. Emmett is the character that brings both heart and humor to story. The relationship of Andy and Pete, best friends since their days in the Academy, was center to giving the reader a reason to care about those characters. Emmett was vibrant and cocky, yet willing to express his  vulnerability to his best friend. The rich dialogue between Andy and Pete strengthened both characters, let the reader peek inside their souls, and opened the door to truly caring what happened to these men. To see the friendship and the bond between them allowed one to empathize with characters. In the movie, Emmett is just an expendable body. Aside from the mentioning of the fact that the two are best friends, the only connection we see is the looks between them, in which Jon Bon Jovi conveys more with his eyes and expression in a few brief seconds than he was allowed to convey with his all too brief (edited out) lines. Anyone who has seen Bon Jovi's work knows he is quite a capable dramatic and comedic actor. Writer\/director Jonathan Mostow shot himself in the foot by cutting out the work of this man. His performance alone would have brought the film to a higher cognitive and emotional level. U-571 could have been both action packed and thought provoking. It was all there in the story. Anyone could have related to Pete's admission that he was scared and his request that Andy tell his parents he died for something important, if he happened to die and Andy lived. For some unknown reason, they decided to keep only half of what makes a film great. I'm sure it will still do fine at the box office, but it's sad that heart and humor were sacrificed for the sake of...  what? A few more explosions? Added lines of technical jargon?

There were many complaints about the De Niro performance and certainly his character was no Travis Bickle. And the role certainly didn't call for one of the top screen actors of his generation.

It is a brilliant, stream-of-consciousness picture packed with phenomenal directing, fresh applications of visual effects, and a duo of characters that will stick in your mind because of their blatant realism. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are simply awesome. Pitt plays an anarchistic, free-willed character named Tyler Durden who serves as a contrast to the unassuming insomniac Jack, played by Norton. Pitt is what we could only hope to be, whereas Norton is a pathetic, suffering human being whose life is lost and devoured by a society of consumerism.The reason Fight Club is so controversial is because of its truthful, explosive nature. Whereas movies such as American Beauty are friendly and clever to the average viewer, FC is much more captivating and daring. It is an intrepid ride through the reality we often prefer to deny. FC presents all the drawbacks we don't wish to hear about of our supposedly advanced society. FC is not about beating others to a bloody pulp, but it focuses upon liberating oneself and having the courage to go with your aspirations and dreams - instead of drowning in a world of conventions and materialism. Ikea, Starbucks, and Martha Stewart are the enemies, and are brilliantly derided by a movie dripping with social parodies. Fight Club is also the paradigm of David Fincher's movies the dark humor will keep you laughing for weeks.Although accused of making fun of people with testicular cancer along with promoting violence, David Fincher's Fight Club clearly applies these aspects of life as integral elements of a potent theme. Testicular cancer is significant in showing how a person much derive motivation from watching others suffer, in order to eventually rejuvenate himself. Violence is used to show a brotherhood of liberated proletariats, but the violence eventually goes out of control and progresses towards terrorism. Overall, FC is a movie about the mind, and focuses on the dangerous repercussions of self-denial, consumerism, and suppressed dreams.From a directing point of view, FC is a masterpiece. Directed by David Fincher (Se7en, The Game), FC revolutionizes the use of visual effects, has great music (the soundtrack by The Dust Brothers is great), and applies a stream-of-consciousness method of narration that is prominently unique.

Ridley Scott brings us the story of Maximus, fallen General of Rome and unwilling slave and gladiator.  He fights because he must and for vengeance on those who betrayed him.  I am so glad Hollywood is giving us these epic tales this summer (can't wait for THE PATRIOT in June) instead of the usual FX bonanzas.  Here, the FX are used to bring ancient Rome to life with astounding quality and scope, great job by Mill Film.      The cast is great (most likely Crowe's star-making turn) with Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed, Djimon Hounsou, and Richard Harris.  R.I.P. Oliver Reed, you were great in this one.  An awe-inspiring score by Hans Zimmer with the help of Lisa Gerrard.  If you know the score from THE INSIDER, you'll recognize her great work here.  A great theme for the Battle of Germania early on.  That in itself is a sight to behold.  See this film and love it for it's grand scale, it's superior performances, it's action, bravado and intensity, and the sheer joy of seeing one of the best films you'll view this year.
