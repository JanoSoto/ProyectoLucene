In 1995, my generation had children -- young teen aged children for they had their kids when they were young teens. And through those eyes is how I watched this film, and that is why it disturbs me and why its a must watch at least once for those who think everything is fine and dandy among teens -- even today.Possible Spoilers ahead --On the outside, the teens in this movie seemed to be living the life of any teen partying, sleeping, not-caring about the next day, and sex. But for these teens, they had to face one more thing in their element, and that was STD's. Not just any STD, the big one HIV and AIDS. These teens seem reckless because they KNOW of this STD but still continue their behavior.One teen, of whom we follow in this film, has quite the reasoning for avoiding the disease of HIV and AIDS and still has sexual relations with as many teen girls as he can. Being a teen, he still hadn't grasped the reality of lies, of being careful, of maturity and restraint. Notches in his belt and bragging rights are his priority.What we get to experience in this film is a segment of teens who don't seem to have much parental direction. Many times I have heard Where are the parents when folks have seen this film. The parents are where they always are Working..thinking they ARE parenting...to teens who may or may not hear the messages.  There is no Hollywood ending, the film is as low as low can get and ends even lower. Many parents who saw this film remarked Not my child. I'll talk to them. But that is the point of the film.This absolutely can be your child. And it absolutely can be the child your child is hanging around.For all of us who were teens once, we know all too well how this can happen.If you're looking for a film with a moral..this isn't it. It is a film that will be interpreted differently by many who see it. Some may see it as kiddie porn, some may see it as schlock, some may see it as unbelievable without proper parenting - and think throwing in a religion as a teaching would help. Maybe..obviously maybe not.I see it as disturbing, horrific and time to get into serious actions for the benefit of our teens to live and grown into responsible adults regardless of their economic background, 2 or single parent household, and sexual education.

He was a factory artist (his slapdash ten minute wonders litter the wall of many of the new rich) and don't tell me all his work was good  or original- a lot of samey-samey abstract pictures of women.The central problem is that  Hopkins is a lovely person and Picasso was not.

I don't believe he was ever nice in that English gentleman sense, only in that car salesman way of being nice to get what they want.

While each one of these topics, in regards to Ali's life, could qualify for a movie by itself the movie does paint a decent picture of the chaos surrounding Ali's life during the ten-year period of his life featured in the film.  The movie only covers his life from his defeat of Liston to his defeat of Foreman.   It briefly touches on his relationship with Malcolm X and to a greater extent with the Nation of Islam, but their isn't a lot of depth and detail.  You don't really get an in depth understanding of many of the political issues underlying the motives of the Nation of Islam or how they were really using Ali to their own ends.  I think that Ali being who he was, when he was, had a great impact on the person he became and could have made into good movie material.The movie doesn't cover any of Ali's development as a fighter.  It just provides some of the highlights from some of the biggest fights of his career; none of his first professional fights, nor his Olympic experience, nor anything about how he became involved with boxing in the first place.  It leaves a lot to be desired if you want to know a lot about how Ali became such an amazing boxer and the true range of opponents he faced and vanquished.Next, it seems like in every other section of the movie Ali is finding a new flame, divorcing the old one, and marrying the new one shortly thereafter.  There is no real study to his weakness for women and how it really affected him and his life.

This criticism has only been confirmed by the enormous success of this summer's over-bloated blockbuster romance, Titanic, and while The Wings of the Dove may not have the most ingenious script, it does manage to succeed where so many others have failed. Adapted from a Henry James novel (The Europeans, The Bostonians), The Wings of the Dove -- which was first made as a made-for-TV movie in Britain in 1979 -- is a lavish romance set in the early 1900's. Kate Croy (played deliciously by Helena Bonham Carter, who garnered a well-deserved Oscar nod for her performance) is a young mistress that has left her poverty-stricken family to live with her wealthy aunt (Charlotte Rampling, Stardust Memories), who is determined to marry her for money and secure the family's fortune. But Kate has already fallen in love with a penniless journalist (Linus Roache), and is caught in the typical dilemma of the beautiful-yet-confused woman in your typical Merchant Ivory movie (and while Wings may have all the aspects of a Merchant Ivory flick, it must be noted that it is, indeed, not as such; the film is directed by Iain Softely, a British film-maker whose only preceding credits are Hackers and Backbeat). An opportunity presents itself, however, when an American relative enters the picture (a charming Alison Elliot). Dying of an unspecified disease, Milly (Elliot) has come to London in search of love, and when she takes Kate and her secret lover on a trip to Venice, Kate hatches a scheme that -- if done correctly -- could win her the guy AND the money. Romance ensues, yet instead of being lumpy and forced (as it was in James Cameron's three-hour soap opera) the love triangle in Wings is as sumptuous as the lush cinematography. We, as the audience, actually CARE about these characters, and want them all to find success in their endeavors. And what keeps us interested is the foreknowledge that they WON'T all find success, which leads us to wonder who will come out on top? Appropriately, the film ends on an open note. While we are given a fairly good idea as to what will happen after the final fade-out, we're still granted permission to wonder about the various possibilities. The picture is beautifully shot, and could probably be enjoyed if only for its visual splendor -- which may, perhaps, be the best aspect of the film. But terrific performances and a taut screenplay certainly contribute to its excellence. There may be smarter and better films this year (i.e. L.A.

This criticism has only been confirmed by the enormous success of this summer's over-bloated blockbuster romance, Titanic, and while The Wings of the Dove may not have the most ingenious script, it does manage to succeed where so many others have failed. Adapted from a Henry James novel (The Europeans, The Bostonians), The Wings of the Dove -- which was first made as a made-for-TV movie in Britain in 1979 -- is a lavish romance set in the early 1900's. Kate Croy (played deliciously by Helena Bonham Carter, who garnered a well-deserved Oscar nod for her performance) is a young mistress that has left her poverty-stricken family to live with her wealthy aunt (Charlotte Rampling, Stardust Memories), who is determined to marry her for money and secure the family's fortune. But Kate has already fallen in love with a penniless journalist (Linus Roache), and is caught in the typical dilemma of the beautiful-yet-confused woman in your typical Merchant Ivory movie (and while Wings may have all the aspects of a Merchant Ivory flick, it must be noted that it is, indeed, not as such; the film is directed by Iain Softely, a British film-maker whose only preceding credits are Hackers and Backbeat). An opportunity presents itself, however, when an American relative enters the picture (a charming Alison Elliot). Dying of an unspecified disease, Milly (Elliot) has come to London in search of love, and when she takes Kate and her secret lover on a trip to Venice, Kate hatches a scheme that -- if done correctly -- could win her the guy AND the money. Romance ensues, yet instead of being lumpy and forced (as it was in James Cameron's three-hour soap opera) the love triangle in Wings is as sumptuous as the lush cinematography. We, as the audience, actually CARE about these characters, and want them all to find success in their endeavors. And what keeps us interested is the foreknowledge that they WON'T all find success, which leads us to wonder who will come out on top? Appropriately, the film ends on an open note. While we are given a fairly good idea as to what will happen after the final fade-out, we're still granted permission to wonder about the various possibilities. The picture is beautifully shot, and could probably be enjoyed if only for its visual splendor -- which may, perhaps, be the best aspect of the film. But terrific performances and a taut screenplay certainly contribute to its excellence. There may be smarter and better films this year (i.e. L.A. Confidential), but I'd be hard-pressed to say that there were any more beautiful.

Clarke,is a breathtaking masterpiece of special effects and symbolism.It is probably the single greatest visual movie ever made.It starts with a surprising as well as disturbing musical overture by Ligeti of about 3 minutes. The screen is black and stays that way until the lion of MGM shows up,the brilliant opening credits appear together with a great shot of the moon,earth and sun together in one view. The music of Strauss is perfect for this beginning. The movie contains of 4 parts from which the first part is the Dawn of Man(10 million years ago) in which we see monkeys who rival each other for water.This is also the first time in which the Monolith appears,that scares and upsets the monkeys very much.In the next shot one of the monkeys then starts to punch with a bone(probably the beginning of the urge by men for destruction and aggression). He takes the bone to the water where he destroys one of the opposing monkeys. He throws the bone in the air which sets up one of the greatest and dramatic scene changes ever made,the bone changes into a space ship. The second part begins.Together with The Blue Danube a series of beautiful images appear on screen. In this part we also get to see the great wit of Stanley Kubrick,although this is a serious film.The Grip Shoes as well as the Zero Gravity Toilet(Watch Dr. Floyd,played by William Sylvester,examine the manual with great care) is very funny.Another great laugh for me was the Dutch translation of the welcome comity.Of course Dr. Floyd chooses English but still... Brilliantly funny is also the fact that Kubrick's own daughter appears in the movie,as Dr. Floyd's daughter! In this part the Monolith appears again as a complete mystery,but now on the moon.A high humming sound comes and the third part begins.The Jupiter Mission is the third part in which the two astronauts Poole(played by Gary Lockwood) and Dave Bowman(played by Keir Dullea) fly to Jupiter to reveal the mystery of the Monolith,although they don't know that themselves.We does know it is the advanced computer HAL-9000(legendary voice by Douglas Rain) and when he makes a mistake all hell on the ship breaks loose.Poole is killed by HAL while he's in space fixing HAL's mistake and then Dave terminates HAL by erasing his memory and functions,HAL sings the song Daisy as his final words.Then a TV shows up in which Dave hears the true meaning of his mission.The screen turns black and the last and best part of the movie begins.Jupiter and beyond the Infinite is a mindblowing 25 minutes of beautiful shots of Jupiter,a dazzling star-gate sequence and a very curious ending sequence in a deserted chamber. The star-gate sequence is for me the ultimate highlight of the movie.The colors and images are simply breathtaking as is the haunting score by Ligeti.Never before and never again has someone tried to make such a scene as this one. The climax is very hard to understand and since I haven't read the book yet(which I will very soon),I still don't really get it.Dave is,after flying into Jupiter through the Star-gate,in a quiet and deserted house. He ages before his own eyes and when he is at his oldest lying in a bed,the mighty Monolith appears at his bed side.He reaches out for it and the next shot is the birth of the star-child as the camera closes onto the Monolith.The Moon appears as well as Strauss' masterpiece Zarahustra(for the third time in the movie). The Star-child reaches earth and the movie ends.The symbolism is very important in this film.There are two main symbols which appear in the movie several timesthe Monolith and the Bone. The Bone appears as the murder weapon of the monkey,as the spaceship that shows up right after the bone is thrown in the air and at the beginning of the Jupiter Mission we see a long spaceship shaped into the form of a bone. The Monolith is even more important as it is the mysterious centerpiece of the story.The monkeys,as well as the scientists on the moon,as well as Dave Bowman on his deathbed react exactly the sameConfused,scared but also humble as they all want to touch it with great respect.In 10 million years nothing has changed,so it appears.Also very important and very well done are the special effects.They are way ahead of their time,considering it was made 10 years before Star Wars.We can see how important the effects are on future science fiction films as Star Wars.For that alone it is a cinematic landmark.The sound is also great,just listen to all those strange sound effects on the Jupiter Mission(breathing!) and the absence(!) of sound while the astronauts are in space. The music is unmistakably necessary in the movie since there are a lot of scenes in which not much happens.For instance the first shots of space underscored by The Blue Danube and of course the opening and ending shots underscored by Zarahustra,which will always be identified as a classical space piece.Last but not least the frantic and psychedelic music of Ligeti,eminent in the star-gate sequence.It gives the scene an extra boost of mystery.A great add on,intentional or unintentional(who knows?),is the music of Pink Floyd(my favorite band).The Masterpiece Echoes(my favorite song ever) from the album Meddle can be heard while watching the last 25 minutes of the movie,Jupiter and beyond the Infinite.To me it was an absolute joy to watch since it gives the scene a totally different look.The sound effects and various moods of Echoes match brilliantly with the movie,as if it was written while watching it.Start the song at the same point as the scene starts and enjoy. A funny and curious thing is that one of the main characters of the movie is called Dr. FLOYD(!!!). There is also a way to watch the entire movie with Pink Floyd music,but that requires several of their albums and is not very convincing.Still,pretty funny to watch.2001 A Space Odyssey is a true cinema-movie,you have got to see it in the Theater.I saw it in my hometown Amsterdam as it was re-run as a classic comeback.That was the second time I saw the movie cause my first was on TV.Yesterday I saw it on DVD,which is pretty cool but it ain't no Theater.In my own private collection I've got the movie on VHS,a German version(aaaahhh) taped when it was on ARTEa cultural channel(yeah right,not even the original version).You've got to see the movie at least two times to really enjoy it,cause the first time probably is not the best to fully understand it.That was my personal experience as well as Woody Allen's and that's a good advice now ain't it? 2001 is probably the most unique movie ever created,because of it's lack of a real story and because of it's beautiful images.Although there are some very long scenes in the movie it never gets boring,especially when you see it in the theater.There is so much to see and hear!Overall,it is one of my personal Masterpieces and then to consider that it isn't even my favorite Kubrick movie(which is Dr. Strangelove)!Brilliant picture.  10\/10  ","genre":null},{"date":"16 January 2004","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  SPOILERS AHEAD!2001 A Space Odyssey is,like Kubrick said himself,more of an experience than an actual movie and therefore a true Kubrick Movie.Movies like A Clockwork Orange(which has the 2001 soundtrack LP in the movie!) and Full Metal Jacket are also more experiences than movies. 2001 A Space Odyssey,made after the legendary model work by Arthur C.

Thus, the camera only sees Madeleine, and no one else.  Thus, the city and the coast is left just to the two of them.  Like Adam and Eve, only a tale of tragedy.  This 'fixation' of both the camera and the character is what gives the film its mysterious and dreamlike quality.  In a way, it's because Scottie is bewildered by Madeleine's mysterious manner, her dream-like qualities (her dream-girl qualities) that makes this film more than just a ghost story, more than a mystery or a thriller.  It's much more personal than a normal movie, and it is because the camera has become a character.  And that, my friends, is hard to pull off.  Which is why I hold Alfred Hitchcock so highly, and which is why you should give this film a second look, if you already haven't seen it once.

With that said, I'll say this.  I studied this film extensively in University, and I analyzed it in terms of gender\/sexual power relations.  There are, of course, some kinky elements to James Stewarts's obsession in this film.  What most people don't realize, is just how much that obsession is made explicit in the film, without the audience realizing. The more Scottie falls in love with (and becomes obsessed with) Madeleine, the more the real world falls away.  Literally, people start to dissapear.  In the beginning, when Scottie is hired to follow her, she is seem with people (in traffic, in a flower shop).  As she becomes more and more the focus of Scottie's infatuation, the crowds of people thin out and dissapear altogether.  The museum of Art more closely resembles a tomb, as only Madeleine's and Scotties car are parked out front.  No one walks the halls of the gallery excepts Scottie, and a curator that Scottie summons for information (who only becpmes present because Scottie wants him to be there for that moment).  At San Fransisco Bay, in the shadow of the Golden Gate Bridge, it is just Scottie and Madeleine.  The colonial town up the coast where Madeleine takes her plunge is more of a ghost town, as there are no tourists, not a person in sight.  Just the two of them. In the redwood forest.  The two of them alone. It is too much of a stretch to assume that everyone in San Fransisco decided not to leave their homes that day. The brilliance of Alfred Hitchcock's directing is that he makes the camera see what Scottie sees.  He's tuning out and ignoring the other people around him, so he just sees Madeleine.

Silver Bullet is a great horror movie by the master of scares Stephen King. I did read his novella Cycle of the werewolf which was OK, not my favorite book but had a very great idea. Silver Bullet took the idea and made it into a really terrifying story that was also a great update to the werewolf monster story. It made you think that what if there was someone in your town who was hiding a secret that they were a monster who could judge you and feel the need to just kill at their own will, and what if they knew that you knew what they were? It makes it a whole lot worse. Silver Bullet is a great movie to watch in the dark that I'm sure will give you goosebumps and make the hair on your arms stand up.The good residents of Tarker's Mill are dense enough to ignore or explain away a series of violent deaths until a little boy is torn to pieces while flying his kite after dark. At that point, the men gang up and go into the fog-shrouded woods to hunt down whatever slasher is out there. The most they achieve is the sighting of one hairy arm and a few more sacrificial victims. But life goes on, and when the summer fireworks show is canceled because people have deduced it might be fatal to stay out after dark, the family's wheelchair-bound son Marty goes coasting off to the bridge to shoot his own fireworks. Needless to say, the hairy killer beast that is certain to be lurking there gets shot in the eyeball by one of Marty's rockets and is now an unhappy hairy killer beast.The acting is decent enough, we have a baby Corey Haim who delivers a very strong performance as Marty. It's sad to think that with the success he had with Lucas, Silver Bullet and The Lost boys that he led the life he did, he could have been something great when you watch this performance. His relationship with Megan Follows who plays Jane his sister was so touching and very believable. We also have a young Gary Busey with those same teeth, lol, but he pulls in a decent performance as well playing the alcoholic uncle who is cool in his nephew's eyes but always lets everyone down. He's sick of doing that so really pulls through for his niece and nephew when they need him most. Everett McGill as the reverend\/werewolf was chilling, you felt a certain sympathy for him at one point as you know he feels some guilt but then he turns very cocky trying to justify his killings and you hate him. He was a great choice for this despicable villain. I love Silver Bullet, it may be dated and the effects are not the greatest, but I think it's a great horror movie that still gives me chills.7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"16 January 2004","score":"33 out of 38 people found the following review useful","review":" I'm not sure why, but it seems like the rating for Silver Bullet is somewhat low on IMDb in my opinion.

It is not because the subject matter is depressing and unappealing, which it is.  But rather, it is so boring and and terribly acted all around (Liam Neeson is the only one that is even watchable).  The idea of Harrison Ford as a Russian is so ludicrous. It is not because of his horrible accent, but rather his star quality (i.e. star persona) does not let him become the role.There have been some comparisons in early comments about this being similar to Das Boot and Run Silent, Run Deep, but those comments are so of the mark it is scary.  The film is filmed so poorly and the cinematography is flat and has not depth of field, nor is there an sense of claustrophobia.  Das Boot was the master of submarine suspense simply due to its shot selection. U-571, although a popcorn flick was much more emotional than this cold fish. Oddly the film is so empty of emotion when the entire movie revolves around tragedy (This is not a spoiler).I am shocked at how poorly Katheryn Bigelow directed this film.  She normally has the ability to create visually stimulating films, even if they aren't the greatest. Strange Days had some beautiful moments, although the script was a mess and there was no mystery to the the actual plot.  Near Dark was campy but quite beautiful.  And, although her film The Weight of Water was derided by critics, the scenes with Sarah Polley were fantastic and wonderfully shot, including some really great handheld camera work.  Of course, everyone say that her handheld chase scene in Point Break is one of the best shots she has ever composed, but I disagree.If you want to check out a Bigelow film, look for the gem Blue Steel with Jamie Lee Curtis, Ron Silver, and a nice small role by Louise Fletcher.

But then again, I am not really a fan of Ron Silver.  He has his moments, but seems wrong for that part.  He doesn't have the ability to match up to Curtis's -masculinity- if that is what it is.Well, in terms of K-19 Widowmaker, I place the blame squarely on Bigelow. The idea isn't awful; the notion of tragic dilemmas faced by authoritative figures and how to deal with them psychologically is in interesting concept.  But the movie fails so miserably.  There are way too many dramatic scenes of Ford contemplating the submarine's problematic scenarios.  Additionally, some of the lighting, specifically the scenes filmed with an overbearing red, is so dull and washes out the actors' faces.  The rest of the film is brown and and devoid of all color.  Not that there should be a myriad of color filling the screen. But color, even in small doses, is important to the psychologically of a film SPOILER (the ice scenes are the only semi-beautiful shots).  I don't mean that bright colors should be employed gratuitously.  A great use of muted colors, specifically grey, as in the Untouchables, are quite beautiful, but that is usually falls to the art direction, costumes, and DP.  Unfortunately, all colors in Widowmaker are one color (e.g. blue, red, white), and use lighting and filters poorly for the effect they are trying to convey.Well, as you can tell, I think this movie deserves all the the bad reviews it received.  There are a lot of submarine movies out there that are very good, or at least competent (e.g. The Abyss,  although not really a true submarine movie; Innerspace, Dennis Quaid was in a type of submarine-- I know it's a stretch; of course there are the standards U-571, Das Boo, and Crimson Tide, all of which use colors effectively and and have a great sense of camera movement and composition; finally, the best submarine movie ever made (well maybe Das Boot takes that honor) is Below, and amazing David Twohy movie, co-written by Darren Arronofsky).In conclusion, avoid K-19 unless you want to sleep or make fun of some of the worst shots ever employed in a large budget film.  Hell, even though people seem to hate Waterworld, although I quite like it for its Road Warrior quality, you have to admit that Dean Semler has some of the most beautiful compositions in that film.

It is not because the subject matter is depressing and unappealing, which it is.  But rather, it is so boring and and terribly acted all around (Liam Neeson is the only one that is even watchable).  The idea of Harrison Ford as a Russian is so ludicrous. It is not because of his horrible accent, but rather his star quality (i.e. star persona) does not let him become the role.There have been some comparisons in early comments about this being similar to Das Boot and Run Silent, Run Deep, but those comments are so of the mark it is scary.  The film is filmed so poorly and the cinematography is flat and has not depth of field, nor is there an sense of claustrophobia.  Das Boot was the master of submarine suspense simply due to its shot selection. U-571, although a popcorn flick was much more emotional than this cold fish. Oddly the film is so empty of emotion when the entire movie revolves around tragedy (This is not a spoiler).I am shocked at how poorly Katheryn Bigelow directed this film.  She normally has the ability to create visually stimulating films, even if they aren't the greatest. Strange Days had some beautiful moments, although the script was a mess and there was no mystery to the the actual plot.  Near Dark was campy but quite beautiful.  And, although her film The Weight of Water was derided by critics, the scenes with Sarah Polley were fantastic and wonderfully shot, including some really great handheld camera work.  Of course, everyone say that her handheld chase scene in Point Break is one of the best shots she has ever composed, but I disagree.If you want to check out a Bigelow film, look for the gem Blue Steel with Jamie Lee Curtis, Ron Silver, and a nice small role by Louise Fletcher.

Lucas Black as Frank Wheatley and Natalie Canerday as Frank's mother Linda Wheatley are also perfectly cast. They present a credible picture of a struggling mother and her son.
