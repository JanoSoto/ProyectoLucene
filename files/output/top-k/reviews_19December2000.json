I mean, let's throw in that the sun has an effect on them to have more action?But that's ok, this movie isn't boring and that's what counts.

Annie Garrett (Robin Tunney) is considered the best female climber in the world. She's dating a billionaire, Elliott Vaugh (Bill Paxton), who wants to climb K2, a difficult climb located in the disputed region of Kashmir on the Pakistan-India border. He wants to wave to the inaugural flight of his new airline as it flies by the summit. I did like the timely use of location, however, as the ongoing India-Pakistan territorial guerrilla war still rages.Despite the possibility of poor weather, they make their ascent and everyone's fears come to pass. Annie, Vaughn and the expedition leader fall into a crevasse at 23,000 feet and no one knows their exact location. Annie's brother Peter (yes Midnight Oil fans, his name is Peter Garrett), in the area to photograph mountain wildlife, organizes an ill-advised rescue mission. Only the craziest and most desperate enlist.   Leading them is Montgomery Wick (the Leathery One, Scott Glenn), who lost his wife to the billionaire's last attempt to reach K2's summit. At first he's not interested, even with only hours to spare before the lost get sick and start dying. But when he hears that Vaughn is among those alive and in need of rescue, he's all ears.The characters don't get any deeper than Hero, Heroine, Love Interest, Burly Mountain Man, Rich Jerk, Comic Relief and so on. But then, we don't expect much more from films such as this. Emotional events happen early, which add weight to events that happen later and that's why we care whether, say, that pickaxe holds the weight of the climber about to fall to his death.  The characters are icons, not people, so the backstory is all they are. As it happens, though, it's enough.Again, it's an action flick so no one expects deep characterization. I only mention this because some action films fail to provide interesting characters even at the most basic, symbolic level. Those that populate Vertical Limit are, at the very least, cute. It's easy to guess who's going to live and who's going to die. Not that Vertical Limit is the first big Hollywood film to be guilty of this, but the basic selection of who lives and who dies goes this way If you're pretty, you live. If you're ugly, sorry. Down the cliffside you go.Director Martin Campbell (Goldeneye, The Mask of Zorro) compensates with some splendid (literally) white knuckle action. He truly takes you to a place where you can die slowly without even knowing it or die in a millisecond, doing something no more significant that setting your pack down for a drink of water. Nearly every deadly scenario you could think of happening on a climb happens here. Campbell's pulled off quite a technical achievement. Heck, most of the time, you can't even tell it's a set.All of this would have been enough, but the film's creators see fit to add explosives into the mix. The thing that's supposed to add excitement and energy to the story is ultimately what ruins it. I never believed for a second that they actually needed to bring nitroglycerine up there on the mission. Sending all three teams packing such a powerful, unstable explosive liquid seems to be way too self-defeating. To root for people this foolish proves difficult. What's most annoying is the inconsistencies in how they treat the stuff. Okay, it reacts to sunlight. But it also reacts to sudden movement. Yeah, I want that strapped to my back as I climb straight up a rock wall. That's what we're supposed to think, though. How can she do that? My point is, it's unnecessary.

Regretfully I didn't get a chance to see it a third time on cinema but subsequently I've watched it over and over again on VHS and it still kicks ass - harder and harder every time I see it!This is the reason why I'm slightly against Woo's current career in Hollywood. He could never stretch himself to do anything like this in America! All the actors are too fantastic to be true Danny Lee (as Lee), Sally Yeh (as Jennie), Chu Kong (as Sydney) and especially charismatic Chow Yun-Fat in the leading role as the killer Jeffrey (I always save the last bullet - either for myself, or my enemy). When he draws his guns and starts to use 'em we know who's the unconditional king of action!Intelligent and profound story is hard and unsparing but somehow truly beautiful. Score is delightful lovely and engaging and a bit sad. Charming song as performed by Jennie captivates in an unimaginable way. Bottomless, thrilling and balletic action just gets wilder and wilder and the stupendous end sequence in the church is definitely the craziest shoot-out in the history of movies and it's so cool I almost cry when I see it in an emotional moment. That's the magic of Woo. The Killer is a spectacular masterpiece! It's just perfect as hell and above any American film ever. John Woo's Bullet in the head (1990) is the only motion picture I know that gets higher than this in my book.

With the wild CDs he puts out and the zany films he's in, a person could think that he might be crazy. But lately he's been losing his touch. With the success of The Wedding Singer, The Waterboy and Big Daddy, he's been shying away from the normal Adam Sandler stick that everyone who loves him enjoys to see. Well Adam Sandler fans rejoice because he is back with a vengeance. Little Nicky is the wild and craziest Sandler film I have ever seen. It may not be the best (I think all will agree with me that that title goes to Billy Madison) but it is the edgiest. The plot revolves around the Satan (Harvey Keitel) after a certain amount of years has to pick a new ruler of Hell. He has to choose from his three sons Adrian (Rhys Ifans), Cassius (Tom Tiny Lister Jr.) and Nicky (Sandler). When he decides to choose himself as the new ruler Adrian and Caussius are livid. They decided to go through the fire of hell backwards and conquer Earth, making it the new Hell. In doing this they are slowly killing Satan, he loses body parts and his power the longer they're on Earth. The only one that can save Earth and Satan is the incompetent and very stupid Nicky. So he goes to Earth to learn how to use his powers and stop his brothers from making Earth the new hell. On the way he meets a cast a characters that is about a mile long. There are so many cameos in this film I lost count. There are many SNL former members (none from the likes of Rock, Spade, or Myers) but there are a very few noticeable one. The comedy is border line on rated R material as there are many gross jokes related on sexual humor, some drug related gags and just some disturbingly funny images. All a person would expect in an Adam Sandler film and more. Sandler pulls off the weird voiced Nicky just like he did Bobby Boucher in The Waterboy. He's always the stand out in his film but everyone else pulled off their characters as best as they could. They were all believable. For those Sandler fans who have seen any of his films, that including Happy Gilmore, will get a very funny and enjoy surprise with one of the cameos. Along with the normal Sandler antics the soundtrack is right on the money. Each song goes along with the action on the screen. In the end, Little Nicky is a funny and at times wild comedy from mastermind Adam Sandler. It will gross, gag and grab all at the same time.

There are so many cameos in this film I lost count. There are many SNL former members (none from the likes of Rock, Spade, or Myers) but there are a very few noticeable one. The comedy is border line on rated R material as there are many gross jokes related on sexual humor, some drug related gags and just some disturbingly funny images. All a person would expect in an Adam Sandler film and more. Sandler pulls off the weird voiced Nicky just like he did Bobby Boucher in The Waterboy. He's always the stand out in his film but everyone else pulled off their characters as best as they could. They were all believable. For those Sandler fans who have seen any of his films, that including Happy Gilmore, will get a very funny and enjoy surprise with one of the cameos. Along with the normal Sandler antics the soundtrack is right on the money. Each song goes along with the action on the screen. In the end, Little Nicky is a funny and at times wild comedy from mastermind Adam Sandler. It will gross, gag and grab all at the same time.

With the wild CDs he puts out and the zany films he's in, a person could think that he might be crazy. But lately he's been losing his touch. With the success of The Wedding Singer, The Waterboy and Big Daddy, he's been shying away from the normal Adam Sandler stick that everyone who loves him enjoys to see. Well Adam Sandler fans rejoice because he is back with a vengeance. Little Nicky is the wild and craziest Sandler film I have ever seen. It may not be the best (I think all will agree with me that that title goes to Billy Madison) but it is the edgiest. The plot revolves around the Satan (Harvey Keitel) after a certain amount of years has to pick a new ruler of Hell. He has to choose from his three sons Adrian (Rhys Ifans), Cassius (Tom Tiny Lister Jr.) and Nicky (Sandler). When he decides to choose himself as the new ruler Adrian and Caussius are livid. They decided to go through the fire of hell backwards and conquer Earth, making it the new Hell. In doing this they are slowly killing Satan, he loses body parts and his power the longer they're on Earth. The only one that can save Earth and Satan is the incompetent and very stupid Nicky. So he goes to Earth to learn how to use his powers and stop his brothers from making Earth the new hell. On the way he meets a cast a characters that is about a mile long.

So I do not have a whole lot of nostalgia in me about any of that.  But this movie was a big surprise, as I did not feel like it spoke only to fans, but to anyone who ever liked and was attached in some way to any television show. I was also not interested in seeing this due to Tim Allen, who I also never saw on television, but he is actually perfectly cast in this movie.  He has to carry a lot of the scenes alone and does a good job.  The other actors, especially Weaver & Rickman, also get their chance to shine.  The best of all is Tony Shalhoub, in a very funny turn.  I did not expect the ending to be as touching as it is, but it capped off a pretty great movie, for me at least.

Fancy editing cuts don't seem to serve much purpose, and the premise of the plot as well as all of the characters besides Arnolds and the main bad guy could have used developing.
