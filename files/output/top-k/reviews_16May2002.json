It is quite apparent that George knows and cares a heck of a lot more about special effects\/technical wizardry than he does about script, plot, and characters that you really care about, good or bad.  I wonder if it ever occurred to him that one of the reasons that the first three movies were so popular were because he was limited with what he could do with effects and so he HAD to focus on the characters to make the movie worth watching.Oh well, with all that said, there's plenty of neat things to watch in this movie.  I would put it up on the same level as many of the Blue Angels IMAX films I've seen recently.

Yes this is what blew me away! The chase was magnificent, love story was average, the massive battles were excellent but it was the little Green Jedi who is the Jedi of all Jedi who at times sounds like Grover who stole the show. It might have been five minutes his whole fight scene but it was the sweetest five minutes of cinema for one moviegoer in their life. I believe Mr Lucas should redesign the Attack of The Clones movie poster and just put Yoda on there in his karate stance. For me the movie now just has Yoda written all over it. When the 2003 Oscars come the Academy should make a break on the usual traditions and award Yoda for his action performance. This would be one moment I would love to see happen in my life. Yoda deserves it and it should really be his second Oscar after his excellent performance in Empire. So let the Oscar Hype begin for Yoda for the best performance as the leading actor in a motion picture. Besides Yoda, the movie has redeemed Lucas I believe. It is much better than Episode 1. It was a great story (just the love story part got very average, made Anakin seem too much of a stalker at times I thought) that gets you going right to the end and makes you wish Episode III comes out very soon. The dialogue was good especially the 'Death Sticks' part but then got flat a few times. The characters were great especially Palpatine\/Sidious and Dooku but I wish that Mace and Jango had more time on screen to strut more of their amazing skill. Another surprise I thought was that Jar Jar seemed funny for once especially when he greets Obi-Wan after so many years. The acting was great and Mr Christensen passes with flying colours as Anakin. The special effects were out of this world and same for the action too. I recommend this to Star Wars fan or not to see. I rate this 9 out of 10 and out of the Star Wars movies I would rate AOTC in the following. Empire, A New Hope, AOTC, Jedi and finally Phantom.

Ok, I know your all wondering if this new prequel sequel brings back some of the 'ol Star Wars magic to the big screen.  Well, happily, the answer is definitely Yes!  This movie IS a good movie.  It's not the greatest Star Wars film ever, but it certainly isn't the worst.  It ranks as one of the best though!The opening credits crawling across the screen seemed kind of odd.  It felt weird to be at a Star Wars movie again.  But, still, the feeling was great. I admit that I had not really been too excited about EPII up until the last few weeks.  I had easily avoided spoilers and etc. online due to a lack of interest in Star Wars after the dreadful (but still a kick-ass lightsaber duel'n flick) Episode I.Attack of the Clones has waaay more action in it, and the CGI special FX are top-notch.  Ten times that of TPM.  You'll find yourself immersed in the Star Wars universe much more than that of any previous Star Wars film.  I don't care what anybody says.  The locations seem so much more real this time around, so vast, so large.  You'll visit places you've never been... like Genosis.  But this time without showing you EVERY little detail that is happening within the environment.The acting, despite what some may say, isn't all that bad.  Albeit you'll forget all about the acting when watching it anyway.  I wasn't really dissapointed at all.  I think there are just some REALLY over-sensitive critics out there whining about Episode II.  Oh, and by the way, the story is MUCH better and a lot more interesting this time around.Anakin is kinda whiney in this movie, but tortured\/confused whiney.. sort of reminding you of Luke Skywalker.. but also showing you a darker and much more evil side that's begging to come out.  Thankfully, Jar Jar's role is small.  Smaller than I thought.  He hardly speaks at all and is only on screen for a tiny amount of time.  Don't let the gungan get-to-ya.  Some of my friends were STILL bothered that he was just there.  Bah!  Get over it!Obi-Wan is the true star of this movie.  Obviously Mr. McGregor did something right.. because it just seemed so right for him to be playing this character this time around.  Obi sees a lot more action than before, though his lightsaber duel at the end is nothing like the one before.  But something else about that scene will make up for it!The dialogue in the movie wasn't bad at all.  Well, at least in any scene other than the love scenes with.. well... you know who!  Some clever dialogue along the lines of Anakin, I feel you'll be the death of me made this movie even better.  Talk about fore-shadowing!And...... Yoda.  He is the only character in the movie that got applause and a standing ovation, no to mention some un-intentional laughter.  People were shouting as soon as the Yoda's-gonna-kick-some-*** scene popped up on screen.  I won't spoil it for you, but you'll be happy that you paid for that ticket after you see the scene.  It's AWESOME!!  It's worth seeing in theaters twice!  You'll love it!Anyway, this movie (unlike it's younger prequel counterpart) is so enjoyable it will make you laugh, excited, worried and very entertained all throughout.

When you find yourself looking at your watch all the time this is not a good sign! I will admit that the last 20 minutes of the film are very well done. But when a movie has two hours preceeding that said 20 minutes, you get the picture. Don't get me wrong, I love Star Wars but at this point I am wishing George Lucas had only made three films, and left the rest in his imagination. One can only watch so many scenes with strange creatures and space ships and computer generated imagery and this is getting to the point of overkill. I could easily tell what was real and what was CGI and even Matte paintings. All in all I found the movie a real bore and would not recommend it to anyone. For real action and adventure try SpiderMan or The Scorpion King. Attack of the Clones should have been called Attack of the Drones!

Unfortunately that is not saying a whole heck of a lot. The first three Star Wars movies were awesome and each one carried it's weight. It is hard to beat perfection and I am afraid that it shows in both of the prequels. I found the acting extremely wooden and uninspiring. I am not a huge fan of the casting in the first place and that is even more obvious in this film. Jimmy Smits?? What the heck were they thinking??!! Samuel Jackson is bad enough.

With all the kids grown up and Jar Jar off to the side (though important to the progression of the story) Lucas has taken the cutsey feeling that TPM had.The story (no spoilers) Well, people are getting all antsy about something and factions are leaving left-n-right. The Jedi council is starting to get overwhelmed. Meanwhile, Kanobe is training young Anakin to be a Jedi. Anakin is now like a grown up punk who whines and bitches alot. Queen Amidala is now a Senator. It becomes a double story of protecting the senator (Anakin's job) and finding out what's going on (Kanobe's job).The good 1) Yoda Trust me, you'll know *exaclty* what I mean when you see this. 2) Ewan McGregor Lots of action and a touch of humor, Kanobe is older but perhaps still needed more training as a Jedi. McGregor delivers the funny quips with good timing. IMO, his acting shines, though perhaps it's because he had the best lines. 3) Last 30 minutes. Finally, action! 4) No Jar-Jar. As I said above, he plays a central role in one scene, but other than that, is out of the picture. Good. Meesa couldn't take another movie him as a leading character. 5) Jango Fett Bobba Fett's dad. Guy kicks ass. 6) Yoda Yes, it's worth mentioning twice. 7) No mention of metachlorines (or whatever) In my opinion, the metachlorine thing was the *worst* thing Lucas could have done. The mysterious force is now just a bunch of germs. 8) Great aliens. Lucas knows how to paint a picture.The bad 1) Dialogue Anakin uses a line on Padme that wouldn't work in a sleazy bar filled with women who haven't seen a man in years. Worked for Padme. Maybe he was using the force all along... Samuel Jackson delivers his lines without any emotion. Maybe that's what he was told to do, but it just seemed like he was reading his lines like someone who wanted to be somewhere else. 2) Pod-racerish scenes There's a couple of scenes where you just feel that Lucas put them in only to show the CGI prowess. Not nearly as bad as the dismal pod racing scene, but it grew tiresome, at least for me. 3) Long strip of non-action in the beginning. For a (long) while Anakin and Kanobe split. Two stories are then told, switching back and forth between them. In the first hour, there's only one action scene. Lotsa talking. 4) Lame story progression. Example Kanobe is looking for a planet not in the star charts. He asks yoda (and a bunch of kids) for help. Yoda tells him to go to the place where the planet should be. Uh, duh? 5) Missed opportunity in Anakin's transition to the dark side. I can't say much, but it's the scene where he goes back to find his mother. So much could have been done to show Anakin's transition. Why Lucas didn't do this, I don't know.It's better than Ep1, not as good as Ep4\/5, and I'm not sure about Ep6. But it's worth seeing, it needs to be seen on the big screen, and it's worth seeing more than once.7\/10.PS. Yoda rocks.

After seeing Episode 1, i was greatly disappointed in the plot, and the casting (Jake Loyd was probably the worst Star Wars casting ever, well maybe next to N'Sync) and the amount of crappy religious elements in it. There were many scenes that could have been edited out of it such as the underwater part where they are being chased by that fish. The emaculate conception crap was laugh out loud funny in its lameness as well. I think that Lucas has listened to all the complaints from fans and tried to address them, and for the most part he suceeded. Jar-Jar actually serves a purpose in this film, and Hayden Christianson is very strong as Anakin Skywaker. He plays the role with anger, and saddness, pulling the viewer in to his struggle. Sure he is whiney, but he is also playing like a 17 year old kid so that is fine by me. He has a look about him that seems to scream evil, and he is very good in this role. Ewen McGregor is strong as well as Obi Wan. He really adds a lot to the role. His performance was very good, and he seemed to have that auora of Obi Wan greatness around him. Natalie Prtman was weak as Padame' as her performance was kind of bland and cookie cutter. Although she was the most beautiful i have ever seen her. She was gorgeous. This movie really set up the future of the Star Wars universe such as introducing the storm troopers instead of the droids. The Droids in the first movie really bugged me, as i wanted to see Strom Troopers. I was happy to see them introduced, but was shocked at their role in the movie. There were some complaints such as the Jedi were made to look like weaklings. I will not reveal how, but you will see when you watch the movie. Most of them are just pushovers. I think they tried to hard to make humour with C3PO and R2D2 and a lot of the time it didn't work. It ended up being rather lame. The fight that Yoda had was cool in the beginning, but the more i thought about it, the more laughable it was. I was chuckling when i was watching it because it was pretty outrageous. My final complaint being that Obi Wan was kind of shown to be a loser, as Anakin was correcting him and making him look stupid, and he was getting beaten up a lot, but i guess it is ok because Anakin is suppossed to be the bad ass of the universe.I was not disturbed with Jimmy Smits, as i thought i would be. He was cool in his role. Chancellor Palpatine and Count Dooku were cool as well, as the dark Jedi badasses they are. I was happy to see an amazing battle with Jedi, and droids and troopers. The last half an hour will make up for Episode one ten fold. I enjoyed this movie beter than Spiderman, as the love theme didn't bother me nearly as much in this movie as it did in Spiderman. I was shaking my head during Spiderman because it was so cliche'd and lame with all the I love you crap. There is some lameness in this movie too, but for the most part it was cool, and nice to see.This movie is really some eye candy. The city in the beginnng of the movie is pure beauty, and amazing to watch. When i think about the complaints of this movie, that it is not as good as the originals, and i agree (although i liked this movie better than the first Star Wars). But think about this. These movies have a lot of back story to deal with. And it is hard to cram all of this story together, and make everyone happy. Plus wouldn't you rather the middle movies be the best? I would. They are still amazing to watch today, and i think there is no way to compare them to these. Lucas had a lot more to work with on Episodes 4, 5 and 6, and in these movies he is more limited in his material.It still bothers me that the ships in these movies look a lot better than the ships on the original trilogy, but there are cool precursors to the AT-ATs and Star Destroyers in this movie. As well as a cameo from the secret weapon. All in all i had a blast watching this movie. This was a feeling that i haven't had for a long time. The final battle was incredible, and everything else was amazing to watch. The story really develops as well as Anakin's character (A cool side note my friend pointed out was that Anakin's clothes get darker as the movie progresses) and i can't wait for Episode 3. Episode 2 gave me A New Hope for the series. A great movie, that is amazingly fun to watch and experience. Great Job Lucas and Company. You have me waiting eagerly until 2005. P.S.

I loved it...but I'll readily admit I loved it because I loved the story before it was ever filmed.There were flaws, not a few.  Some are minor Tolkienite quibbles I won't bore you with (like say, where was Andúril, why was Sam blond, etc.,) others are glaring--Nazgûl make bad synchronized swimmers and were not scary at all, and I *still* can't tell Merry and Pippin apart.  One horrid error I feel was one that was unfortunately rather unavoidable--why would anyone expect anyone unfamiliar with Tolkien to keep the names of the Fellowship straight?

The droids were very entertaining, and Yoda kicked his little green butt into overdrive for some seriously Jackie Chan-type action! Who knew?

While I can't deny that they are indeed beautiful, I have two specific issues with them.  First that they are indeed so perfect as to not have the somewhat gritty reality quality that the first films had.  They feel more like a video game or a cartoon at times than a film.  Secondly, that there are so many separate elements included on the screen in some scenes that it becomes overwhelming and scatters the focus of the scene itself.  Also, in re-watching the first films, I was struck at how much edgier both the dialogue and the characters were then.  While many of us could recite and quote the great lines from the first three films, the lines from Episodes I and II seem to be forced and in some cases are simply recycled poorly. Amidala could have been edgier with better lines, and a more intense, less American Pie teenage boy to play against.  The audience laughed in places that it obviously wasn't intended, and it was unfortunately due to the hormonal rather than anguished\/love-struck performance that should have been.  Ewan was good, but again needed to be more edgy and less wishy-washy....the interaction between Obi-Wan and Anakin fell flat for me, particularly since it was supposed to be taking place after they'd been together for 10 years.  10 years training as a Jedi would certainly have ingrained far more maturity and tact in Anakin even if he would have still had the ego of a 20 year old.  They would have been more like partners of mutual respect, rather than the relationship seen.....one that could have been undermined in a far more effective subtle fashion than occurred.  It was actually this relationship that was the key to the entire plot of this film.....Anakin's desire for respect and praise of his abilities, to be thought of as an equal while being egged on by the Senator who played to his ego.  Unfortunately, it simply didn't succeed.  I know some will think it blasphemous to say so, but it seems to me that while George Lucas has continued to develop his skills as a director of special effects, his skills of directing actors and his writing seem to have atrophied a bit over the years.  I was reminded of the adage that simply because you *can* do something (i.e. with technology) doesn't mean that you *should*.  Less is more, and using effects as enhancement and backdrop rather than making them the overwhelming star would have instead made this a film at least equal to the original three.  I feel that Lucas is truly visionary, has blazed the trail for the present movie industry, and will bring them finally into the age of digital projection that has so long been overdue.

In short, I liked it.Star Wars Episode II Attack of the Clones, while short on Jar Jar and long on great visuals and action sequences, is all over the place.  It has no genuine, consistent tone.  There are moments of violence, darkness, and serious subject matter, and then the next moment there is a cheap laugh. The film wants to be dark and mature, to deal with the duality of good and evil, but it does not have credibility or the screenplay to make the audience believe (or Make-believe) in what is going on.  In other words, the film fails to entertain.There are wonderful scenes in Episode II, and there are chunks of it that I wish could be transplanted into a film that is less insulting to its audience.

What should be handled with subtlety (such as the love story) is so blatant that it is awkward and almost laughable.

As a stand-alone film, it's very enjoyable. It's been a while since John McTiernan has directed a film. His last ones were the remade THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR and 13th WARRIOR. Here, it's thought that John has returned to what he does best, and it was nice to see a film that was surprisingly good. At first glance ROLLERBALL looks like it's going for the MATRIX effects that so many movies, shows, and commercials have been using too much, but John has stuck to his own methods of film making, and hasn't sold out. Every action scene was not filmed in any over- outlandish style, and that was a star swinging high point. Chris Klien seems more accustomed to comedy, but here, he's starting to learn the ropes as a man of action. Though his youth is apparent within his role, he makes it through as a hero. LL Cool J has proven himself to be a compotent actor long ago, and he still has his own brand of charisma. Rebecca Romjin-Stamos also commands the screen as a tough Rollerball player who happens to have a romantic relationship with Klien's character. Another nice touch was the international casting and locations through the whole film. It gave a great mix. Especially with the great Jean Reno as the villain who always does good in the movies he's in. The rest of the villains are also great. They're cruel and it's a relief when they get what they deserve. For a PG-13 rated film, it was surprisingly violent. It's hard to believe that the theatrical version was edited from the original which supposedly has more violence.But if the MPAA is getting lax, so what? One less movie getting too much hasslement. The action is brutal and pounding. When one concentrates fully on the film, it's like actually being in the arena with all the fierce action going on all around. When someone gets struck, it's felt by the viewer. But the standout action scene is a chase through darkness where it's totally pitch black and scene through nightvision lenses. This was a great method, because the atmosphere would be ruined by Hollywood lighting effects. This added on to wondering if Chris Klien and LL Cool J are gonna get away from the bas guys. The small roles were also cool. Like seeing WWE's Vince's son, Shane McMahon for one full second. (Blink and he'll be gone.) And surprisingly, former wrestling commentator Paul Heyman had a bigger role that thought, and has some funny lines. All in all, this is John McTiernan's best film in a long time.

That having been said... The only real clones are the sorry fans that will go out and see AOTC multiple times to line the pockets of Mr. Lucas. I get the distinct feeling that George resents having to make these films, after all, he's been dealing with the same basic world-scape since 1977, and more is all anyone seems to want from him-- but only more Star Wars. In response, he has delivered unto his fans a lifeless piece of digital film making. The characters are devoid of any depth, and the dialogue is some of the worst I've heard in a long time. I heard open moans of distaste in the theater at the C3-P0-turned-bad-pun-machine on the battle field. I understand the grainy aspects of the special effects are due to the movie being seen on a film projector instead of a digital one, but come on! This is no excuse for the poor overall quality of the project. It brakes the first cardinal sin of movie making it's booooooorrrrriiing. The film started off well, and my hopes were high. But it peaked after 35 minutes, and then was flat and unimpressive until the final battle, which seemed truncated and unresolved. I know the storyline needs to be unresolved at this point, but there is no payoff within this film. You wait and wait and wait and there's nothing to justify it. Everything you want to see in this film, as far as the progression of the story-- well, it just never happens. And I can't stress enough how terrible the dialogue is.

I expected that rather then answering questions about the Star Wars universe, it would pose more, like Phantom did. I was wrong. It not only answered a lot of questions posed by Phantom, but also questions posed by the first films.The acting is... well, it's Star Wars. McGregor delivers an average performance, going too far to try and measure up to Sir Alec Guiness's Obi-Wan. He plays a great clueless down-and-out in films like A Life Less Ordinary, but as a Jedi master, especially as one trying to live up to a standard set by someone like Sir Alec, he fails miserably.The familiar english accents that have become a key part of the Star Wars universe have pretty much been phased out by shooting in Australia, and the changes in the accent base are a little too much for me. It may seem a minor point, and I'm certainly all for using Fox Studios and supporting the Australian film industry, but they get in the way a bit.Christensen is so one sided, it is hard to believe anything he says. His dark peircing eyes are his only quality, and his emotional range is apparently easy to forgive because of his glance. Jake Lloyd was bad, but young. What's Christensen's excuse?Temuera Morrison delivers an outstanding performance as Jango Fett, as does his clone-son Daniel Logan. The fight with the Fetts has to be one of the highlights of the whole piece.Sam Jackson takes the show away from the McGregor\/Christensen focus though. His performance in a part he was no doubt determined to get perfect is incredible. *Sentence includes slight spoiler* The entrance he and the Jedi make on Geonosis will blow you away.Once again the colour themes are continued. It is my theory that in each of the films, a different colour throughout the film sets the themes. In Hope, it was a yellow reflecting the mediocre aspects of Luke's life. A cold Blue for Empire as the darkness of the saga is emphasised. A dark Green in Jedi hinting at the Saga's end. Phantom chose a light green to pick up on the beauty of the Old Republic. Clones too uses this same colour theme in Orange, as the dawn of the Wars are brought out.The action is back to the grand Star Wars battles. *Spoilers ahead* Geonosis, The Dooku fight, the Coruscant battle, it's all spot on. You get to see more of the great planets in the saga. Coruscant almost reminded me of Speilberg's cities in AI when you get right down to ground level.*More Slight Spoilers* It's interesting to see Ahmed Best and Anthony Daniels putting in cameo appearances in the Coruscant bar scene, and while 3-P0 is slightly more annoying then usual, he's also very funny. In a particular scene he quips What a drag as R2 pulls his head along the floor of the Geonosian arena, and minutes later remarks how he's Beside himself as his head gets dropped next to his body.*More Slight Spoilers* The Yoda fight sequence is incredible, the little jedi hobbling in, bouncing around for the fight, and, at the amusement of the audience, composing himself and hobbling out!I've not had as much fun in a Star Wars film since I first saw Jedi, and I'm glad it's back on form. You'll find clones improves your view of Phantom, and it'll take a couple of screenings until you've taken it all in!Phantom Menace was such a drastic change from the familiar Star Wars universe that, after clones, you can understand why it wasn't accepted very well.

The fight with the Fetts has to be one of the highlights of the whole piece.Sam Jackson takes the show away from the McGregor\/Christensen focus though. His performance in a part he was no doubt determined to get perfect is incredible. *Sentence includes slight spoiler* The entrance he and the Jedi make on Geonosis will blow you away.Once again the colour themes are continued. It is my theory that in each of the films, a different colour throughout the film sets the themes. In Hope, it was a yellow reflecting the mediocre aspects of Luke's life. A cold Blue for Empire as the darkness of the saga is emphasised. A dark Green in Jedi hinting at the Saga's end. Phantom chose a light green to pick up on the beauty of the Old Republic. Clones too uses this same colour theme in Orange, as the dawn of the Wars are brought out.The action is back to the grand Star Wars battles. *Spoilers ahead* Geonosis, The Dooku fight, the Coruscant battle, it's all spot on. You get to see more of the great planets in the saga. Coruscant almost reminded me of Speilberg's cities in AI when you get right down to ground level.*More Slight Spoilers* It's interesting to see Ahmed Best and Anthony Daniels putting in cameo appearances in the Coruscant bar scene, and while 3-P0 is slightly more annoying then usual, he's also very funny. In a particular scene he quips What a drag as R2 pulls his head along the floor of the Geonosian arena, and minutes later remarks how he's Beside himself as his head gets dropped next to his body.*More Slight Spoilers* The Yoda fight sequence is incredible, the little jedi hobbling in, bouncing around for the fight, and, at the amusement of the audience, composing himself and hobbling out!I've not had as much fun in a Star Wars film since I first saw Jedi, and I'm glad it's back on form. You'll find clones improves your view of Phantom, and it'll take a couple of screenings until you've taken it all in!Phantom Menace was such a drastic change from the familiar Star Wars universe that, after clones, you can understand why it wasn't accepted very well. Certainly, I'll be watching Phantom again now, as I feel much more happy with it then when Clones wasn't out.Check this film out, you won't be disappointed. It really IS Star Wars after all!

I had heard and read mixed reviews from the critics and fans going into the movie.  So, I was cautiously optimistic.Those fans saying this is best of the bunch or second only to Empire Strikes Back, I have to wonder what version they were watching.  The version I saw... I can honestly say this comes no where near the original trilogy.   This movie is only marginally better than episode I.  Empire is still the best of the bunch!Problems with this movie  Script, Script, Script -- Acting, Acting, Acting.Does anyone on the planet believe there was any character development between Amidala and Anakin?  The love story was not one bit believable... lines between them were awkward and not for one minute do I believe any of the chemistry that was being portrayed OR attempted to be portrayed. YUK!Mr. Lucas has one attempt left to right the ship.  Episode III is our only hope.  Mr. Lucas has all the money in the world to hire the best, most creative talent out there.  My suggestions to him for Episode III is the followingHire the best screenwriter available... please, do not write the script yourself... it simply isn't working.Secondly, pass the directing reins to someone else.   Again, it simply hasn't worked in the first two prequels.I hate to bash Mr. Lucas... I think he walks on water... I'd clean his toilet if he asked me BUT something this go-around is lacking from his professional pallet.  If the original trilogy's finished product would have been along the lines of these first two episodes, there wouldn't have been any prequels.  The franchise would have been slapped with RIP!!

Terrible lines in places, annoying characters, a bit of a lack of plot, and a very disconnected sense of continuity with the rest of the Star Wars universe.However, I was very pleasantly surprised. The major difference between this film and Episode 1 is the dialogue. Though some lines could have been left out, I didn't feel like I had been suckered into seeing a bad movie. The plot line of Episode 2 is MUCH more interesting than Episode 1. Mainly, you feel a real sense of continuity. Though I won't go into detail, one such cool buildup is for Boba Fett, who makes several appearances throughout the movie. You will witness his real origin. There are many other connections to the other films, but I won't mention them here. The special effects were simply amazing, including the animation and design of Yoda... which is important. -)Anakin Skywalker was a much more interesting character in this movie. He wasn't just there to win through dumb luck, or shout Wow, cool! constantly. He was a genuine human being, and being a teenager, I was easily able to relate to the ways he reacted to different events. Though the actor playing him (honestly, I didn't check for his name, though I should know) didn't deliver two or three of the lines the way he should have, he did a very good job with the rest of the role. The love story between him and Senator Amidalah (sp) felt very real, but did not intrude on the rest of the story.This movie was significantly better than Episode 1. I walked in expecting a mediocre movie, and got what I would honestly call good. Not great, but good. Worth the evening price for a movie.
