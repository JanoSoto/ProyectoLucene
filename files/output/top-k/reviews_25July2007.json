The film is far less dark and it is fulfilled with action, explosions and gaudy images, just like a James Bond flick. It is obvious enough that the new director Joel Schumacher has a vision which is the opposite of Burton's one.Schumacher seems to be a filmmaker who grew up with the campy TV series from the '60s which starred Adam West and Burt Ward. The movie Forever looks like a conjugation of that series and the atmosphere from the Burton movies and Schumacher never hesitates to include references from that series and the first two films. Unfortunately, this is a disastrous move...At the very beginning, we assist to a gravity-less confrontation between Batman and coin-flipping, disfigured gangster Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones), whose only purpose is to give an introduction without rushing anything in. By the way, we assist to the introduction of Dr. Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman), a psychologist who tries to seduce Batman, but she falls in love with Bruce Wayne.One night at the circus, Two-Face kills the members of the Grayson family, an acrobat group, except the youngest one Dick (Chris O'Donnell). Bruce Wayne then offers to Dick to accommodate him. But the boy quickly discovers his host's secret. Progressively, Dick wins Wayne's trust and he's allowed to become Batman's sidekick, Robin.At the same time, the Riddler, aka Edward Nygma (Jim Carrey), arrives. Nygma is the inventor of the Box, an apparatus having the capacity of picking up cerebral waves and transmitting them directly to the Riddler's brain.While the first two movies only counted three main actors, this one has no less than five major characters. And of these five characters, two are good, two are bad and one is rather average.It's Val Kilmer who's that average actor. His performance is correct, without being exceptional. We feel that he doesn't own that glum and tortured soul which Michael Keaton owned so well in the first movie. However, he is not insensitive and we can notice some moments of melancholy when he dreams about his parents' murder. He might be intelligent, but when he tries (and succeeds) in finding the Riddler's real identity, nobody can fall for his mental capacities. To sum up, his performance can be ranked in-between both Keaton roles.After Vicki Vale and Selina Kyle, it's Chase Meridian's turn to fall in love with Bruce Wayne. But she is boring and often annoying, having practically no role to play, but the traditional damsel-in-distress role.But it's Tommy Lee Jones who is the worst of them all. And yet, he was the ideal guy to play this part... if only he played it the right way. Jones' legendary serious and imperturbable mood should have been the main ingredient for Two-Face, but Jones decided to go over-the-top and transform himself into a wild man. And these are the results  he acts like a moron when he's happy and when he's not, he reacts like a child who has been stolen from his lollipop. One technical mistake involves that Two-Face flips his coin until he gets the option he wants, while it's not the way it works in the comics. But I have to admit that his make-up was pretty good and convincing.On the good actors' side, we first find Chris O'Donnell who is surprisingly successful as Dick Grayson\/Robin. We can feel his boiling and impetuous temperament after the murder of his family and the parallelism of this drama with Bruce Wayne's own tragedy acts like some sort of catalyst and brings out Wayne's dark memories, adding a slight, but essential psychological side to the film.But it's Jim Carrey who steals the show as the Riddler. Contrary to Jones, Carrey plays his part like any other role he's played before, that is by being exuberant and maniacal. And he's so sensational that he unavoidably provokes laughter from the audience, should he act sensefully or not. Besides, I think that it's there that Jones made his mistake. He saw what Carrey was doing and thought that it was great, so he tried to act the same way. He just didn't realize that it wasn't working in his case.Anyway, the whole movie is exuberant and over-the-top. This should explain the overabundant use of more-or-less adequate gadgets. The Batcave, which was previously a sinister place, now looks more like Q's headquarters. I was strongly disappointed to see the Batmobile rolling on the side of a building with the help of a grappling gun. And the idea of the fireproof cape under which Batman hides is frankly ridiculous.Gotham City's architecture doesn't really change, but its peaceful and calm look is transgressed by the apparition of ludicrous billboards, like the giant luminous eye. And how could we forget the the incredibly stupid replica of the Statue of Liberty? So, overall, Batman Forever is an attempt to make the franchise more accessible to those who didn't appreciate Tim Burton's dark and bizarre treatment.But it's not necessary to be a fan of the series to realize at which point Schumacher's movie is silly and ridiculous. The director can try to redeem himself by strewing his work of references to win over the nostalgic ones, but it changes absolutely nothing. It can even make things worse...Batman Forever might be superior to its 1997 sequel Batman & Robin, which slightly rises its value, but it's far from receiving praises.

Some Like It Hot and Tootsie both did the theme as well as its possible to get. Films that were witty, snappy and almost impossible to dislike. And then along comes Mrs Doubtfire. A film that wanted to be Tootsie for the 90s and didn't even come close.Certainly casting Robin Williams was a wise move. His talent for rapid-fire impressions and lightning-quick transformations makes him ideally cast. And the makeup work is pretty impressive. But I think the problem I have with the film is I just couldn't buy his reasons for wanting to disguise himself as a woman.In Some Like It Hot and Tootsie, the men in those films were forced to don drag through desperation, and it made their situations that much more believable. Mrs Doubtfire is aimed squarely at the level of simplistic melodrama. Robin Williams gets divorced from his wife, Sally Field, and poses as a housekeeper so he can keep seeing his kids. That's not desperation. That's insanely contrived plot mechanics. The type of thing that only happens in films. Not real life.I think another problem is director Chris Columbus. Columbus, for all his success as an A-list director, is not a particularly great filmmaker. At best his films are amiable fare, but I have yet to see one film on his resume that is remarkable. Certainly Mrs Doubtfire is nicely made and very polished, but its also overlong, and it doesn't really know what to do with itself. The film would have benefited from some tighter editing. The scene when the kids realise who Mrs Doubtfire really is could have been left out altogether as it has no bearing at all on the rest of the film.Mrs Doubtfire is a rather predictable film too. You can see where Williams' character, Daniel Hillard is going in terms of growth. He starts out as an inattentive husband, and as Mrs Doubtfire he realises his shortcomings and changes his ways. Columbus is known for portraying characters in clear colours of black and white. You hardly ever find a shade of grey in his films. Well, except maybe for one.There is one thing Mrs Doubtfire gets right, and that's Pierce Brosnan's character, Stu. Stu is the new boyfriend going out with Daniel's ex-wife, Miranda. Daniel can't stand him, and has to suffer in silence as he watches this rich and successful man romance his family right out from under his prosthetic nose.It could have been a lot easier for Stu to have played as a one-dimensional villain. Like a smarmy, silver tongued devil who hates the kids making it that much easier for us to sympathise with Daniel. But Brosnan is a good enough actor to invest a real sense of likability and depth into the character, and seems a decent fella who might just be good for the family after all.The downside to this is it makes it that much harder to like Daniel. We're supposed to be sympathetic with Daniel's plight, and having him make snide comments to someone who is really a nice fella just makes him seem petty and selfish. And its an approach that sits at odds with Daniel's supposed emotional growth.Another question to consider is the comedy. Is it all that funny? Well Robin Williams gives another of his energetic performances, and you still can't help but marvel at the way he improvises comic routines out of thin air. But Mrs Doubtfire doesn't quite match up to some of Williams' finest performances in Good Morning Vietnam, or Dead Poets Society. And he overdoes some of the shtick to irritation. Case in point being what should have been the film's ultimate comic set-piece. A scene in a restaurant, where he must be in two places at once as Daniel and Mrs Doubtfire.Like I said earlier, this film is overlong, and that is exactly the problem with this scene. It goes on for far too long, and having him dash back and forth between dinner tables soon gets tedious. What it needed was a more energetic pace to help things zip along. But Columbus is stuck on autopilot.Mrs Doubtfire doesn't quite plumb the depths of Williams' later forays into sentimental schmaltz. At least the ending is partly realistic about divorced couples. But still, if I were Miranda I would have had Daniel carted off to the loony bin after his bizarre antics. Not giving him full visitation rights to their children.

The theme of this movie seems to be that no one who can call themselves a human being can be said to be guiltless. This is further reinforced by the fact that none of the characters in this movie seem to have any redeeming features about them whatsoever. And, believe it or not, it makes for a damn good, if slightly uncomfortable story. Sometimes the truth hurts, but it must be faced.Let's look at the characters. Gene Hacman plays Little Bill, a guy who may have been a judge in Montgomery County, Maryland before he got the job of sheriff of Big Whiskey, with the lenient sentence he gave to the boys who cut that woman (a whore, actually. See what I mean about the characters? Where do your sympathies lie with these types of people in a story?) Then the people who come to the rescue are nothing more than lowly assassins. You have English Bob, who got the hell kicked out of him just for bringing in a gun and mentioning the queen's name on Independence Day. Again, was Little Bill once a Montgomery County judge? Kill each other, but I'd better not catch you with a gun or saying something politically incorrect. Anyway...Clint Eastwood is William Muny, a man with a past who is trying to leave it behind him. But because he is struggling to survive and take care of two young children by himself, the $1000 is too much to resist. I ain't like that no more, he repeats throughout the movie and it sounds like the refrain of a ballad. Ned is his partner in crime. Then you have this worthless braggadocios kid who comes along and you're left wishing they would shoot him just so he would shut his damn mouth.Like I said, it's tough to pick loyalties among such a bunch of lowlifes, but I cheer when Clint comes into the poolhall toward the end of the movie and says in that quietly menacing voice of his, Who's the fellow that owns this s--thole?, because I know what's coming next. And it ain't Let's all hold hands together and sing GIVE PEACE A CHANCE. William Muny gives Little Bill his due in spades and then rides off into a stormy night.Clint dedicated this movie to Sergio Leone, and it is a movie worthy of his old mentor. Like Leone, the good guys and the bad guys aren't clearly defined, and it depicts the Old West as it perhaps really was. No real heroes, no cowards, nothing is glorified or affirmed.

During his long career, he has raised tons of controversy with his documentaries, especially during this decade, with the likes of the widely seen films, Bowling for Columbine and Fahrenheit 9\/11. A few years after making his debut, Moore made this fictional piece, which is his only non-documentary film to date. Canadian Bacon is a comedy film, one which unfortunately didn't turn out so well.The U.S. President is currently doing very poorly in the opinion polls, with the country's economy dropping very low. To raise his popularity, the President is convinced that he must start a war, something which he has never done before during his time in the White House. So, he decides to conduct a cold war against Canada. He uses the media to lie and do everything else he can to make Canada look bad and manipulate the American public into believing that their northern neighbours are their enemies. Bud B. Boomer, the Sheriff of Niagara Falls, crosses the border with Deputy Honey, Kabral Jabar, and Roy Boy, where they all intend to attack! As you would expect from Michael Moore, this movie is very political, and if you're familiar with his political views, it shouldn't surprise you that this movie bashes the White House and the American military, whether you like it or not. Neither Americans nor Canadians are portrayed in a positive manor in the film, as neither are portrayed as very bright. Some Canadians have been offended by this movie, due to all the stereotypes, but personally, I'm not. In fact, I think one of the only remotely funny parts is the one where Sheriff Bud B. Boomer causes a riot at a hockey game in Canada when he says that Canadian beer sucks. I think the part where the RCMP Officer says I don't know what you're talking aboot, eh? gave be a bit of a snicker as well. However, most of the jokes, whether they're jabs at Canadians OR Americans, are simply not funny.Comedian John Candy, a Canadian, starred in Canadian Bacon as Bud Boomer. The movie was released after his tragic death in 1994 from a heart attack, and his role in it was the last role he ever completed (he died during the filming of Wagons East). I was only about 7 1\/2 years old when he died, and had never heard of him during his life. However, I have since discovered how great a comedian he was by watching SCTV, a classic sketch comedy show, as well as the hilarious slapstick comedy Planes, Trains & Automobiles. Canadian Bacon, however, is not a highlight of Candy's career, though he might add something to the film. R.I.P.A comedy movie about a war between America and Canada sounds like a good idea, but Trey Parker and Matt Stone did a MUCH, MUCH better job with it when they made South Park Bigger Longer & Uncut! In Canadian Bacon, the jokes are mostly mediocre, and the movie may start out SLIGHTLY promising, but just drags for most of its approximate ninety-minute run. It appears that many have enjoyed this movie much more than I have, so I won't say avoid it like the plague, but I wouldn't expect a classic piece of political satire, and if you have high expectations, don't be surprised if they are not met.

Only, this time, there are two super-villains.Burton keeps it going and presents an even darker and more disturbing vision of Gotham City, forsakes somehow the psychological side of the superhero and focuses more on giving more action, chases and technological gadgets for this first Batman sequel.The movie opens on the apparition of the Penguin, played by Danny DeVito. The Penguin keeps many characteristics coming from the original comics, like his arsenal of umbrellas, his short and chubby stature, his kick for birds (especially penguins) and his top hat. However, many modifications have been made, mainly to remain faithful to the dark and sinister atmosphere which already prevailed in Batman and which stays in Batman Returns. These changes are mainly mirrored in his appearance, since he's now presented as deformed, with fins instead of hands, a long beak-like nose and his grotesque clothes.The Penguin comes up to the surface after having lived his whole life in Gotham's sewers. He tries to find his parents only to discover that they're both deceased. Machiavellian businessman Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) then suggests the Penguin to present himself in the elections to become the mayor of the city, with less-than-altruistic plans.The other villain who jumps into the game is Catwoman or more commonly, Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer). Kyle is Shreck's awkward secretary and when she discovers her boss' malevolent plans, he throws her of the window. But mysteriously, after a group of cats gathered around her body, Kyle gets up, goes back home, where she goes completely berserk, and creates her feline alter ego.It's now up to Batman (Michael Keaton) to come to terms with those two new adversaries who each have different plans and objectives.The Penguin is accompanied by henchmen who look like a group of artists having escaped from a freak show or from the carnival from the movie Something Wicked This Way Comes. As for Catwoman, she's a thief and she falls in love with Batman. The situation gets more complicated when the real people, Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle, begin to feel a particular affection for each other.The Penguin and Catwoman team up to discredit Batman and arrange things so Gotham's citizens would turn up against him, which would make things way easier for the Penguin and his election plans.It must be said that their plans are meticulously prepared and greatly imaginative. Let's say that their actions are more convincing than the Joker's ones in the first movie.But in Batman Returns, the characters are generally more two-dimensional than in the first movie. The psychology of the characters is far less explored and it's the general presentation who wins in that case. Not only do the look and the costumes of the characters are carefully prepared, but the action scenes also are.The Penguin's presentation is fairly good. He's ugly, grotesque and frightening. His den is no less either. The Catwoman costume, made of leather and 'claws' is appropriated for such a dark picture.Many gadgets appear in Batman Returns. Some are original, inventive and useful, while others are frankly ridiculous. I didn't like what looks like some kind of 'batarang' which automatically hits the enemies one by one and the Batmobile which 'auto-mutilates' to escape from the police cars. However, the Batsuit's retractable wings is a brilliant idea.Gotham City still is a Gothic, dark, disturbing and postmodern metropolis. But the atmosphere is different somehow. The action of the film is set during the Christmas period, which is even more bizarre. We could almost assert that it's some kind of test from Burton's part before the director would launch himself into the production of The Nightmare Before Christmas. At one certain moment in the movie, we even see sunlight, which didn't happen at all in the first movie.The dialog is sometimes bizarre, should it be intentional or not. It can lead to lengthy, boring and disconcerting scenes. But there also are grandiose lines, such as the one where the Penguin distorts the most famous line from David Lynch's movie Elephant Man. And we must not forget that scene where Catwoman meows in front of Batman and the Penguin, just before the store behind her blow up.I also loved the scene where Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle become aware of each other's respective alter ego. There's visibly something that happens in their minds at that precise moment.Batman Returns is far from being perfect, but it's a much acceptable result nevertheless, especially with such expectations from the public's part. You must notice that if there's something difficult in the film industry, it's to make a sequel from an already acclaimed and popular hit picture. But Burton succeeded in his challenge.And when you look at the Batman movies which follow Batman Returns, that is those from Joel Schumacher, the value from Returns heightens even more. Some people would even say that this movie is a consolation prize. But while this film is not as good as the first one, it must be appreciated. And it's not necessary to force yourself.

","genre":"Action"},{"date":"25 July 2007","score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" After an excellent first movie, Tim Burton is back for the next revisionist adventures of the Dark Knight. Only, this time, there are two super-villains.Burton keeps it going and presents an even darker and more disturbing vision of Gotham City, forsakes somehow the psychological side of the superhero and focuses more on giving more action, chases and technological gadgets for this first Batman sequel.The movie opens on the apparition of the Penguin, played by Danny DeVito. The Penguin keeps many characteristics coming from the original comics, like his arsenal of umbrellas, his short and chubby stature, his kick for birds (especially penguins) and his top hat. However, many modifications have been made, mainly to remain faithful to the dark and sinister atmosphere which already prevailed in Batman and which stays in Batman Returns. These changes are mainly mirrored in his appearance, since he's now presented as deformed, with fins instead of hands, a long beak-like nose and his grotesque clothes.The Penguin comes up to the surface after having lived his whole life in Gotham's sewers. He tries to find his parents only to discover that they're both deceased. Machiavellian businessman Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) then suggests the Penguin to present himself in the elections to become the mayor of the city, with less-than-altruistic plans.The other villain who jumps into the game is Catwoman or more commonly, Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer). Kyle is Shreck's awkward secretary and when she discovers her boss' malevolent plans, he throws her of the window. But mysteriously, after a group of cats gathered around her body, Kyle gets up, goes back home, where she goes completely berserk, and creates her feline alter ego.It's now up to Batman (Michael Keaton) to come to terms with those two new adversaries who each have different plans and objectives.The Penguin is accompanied by henchmen who look like a group of artists having escaped from a freak show or from the carnival from the movie Something Wicked This Way Comes. As for Catwoman, she's a thief and she falls in love with Batman. The situation gets more complicated when the real people, Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle, begin to feel a particular affection for each other.The Penguin and Catwoman team up to discredit Batman and arrange things so Gotham's citizens would turn up against him, which would make things way easier for the Penguin and his election plans.It must be said that their plans are meticulously prepared and greatly imaginative. Let's say that their actions are more convincing than the Joker's ones in the first movie.But in Batman Returns, the characters are generally more two-dimensional than in the first movie. The psychology of the characters is far less explored and it's the general presentation who wins in that case. Not only do the look and the costumes of the characters are carefully prepared, but the action scenes also are.The Penguin's presentation is fairly good. He's ugly, grotesque and frightening. His den is no less either. The Catwoman costume, made of leather and 'claws' is appropriated for such a dark picture.Many gadgets appear in Batman Returns. Some are original, inventive and useful, while others are frankly ridiculous. I didn't like what looks like some kind of 'batarang' which automatically hits the enemies one by one and the Batmobile which 'auto-mutilates' to escape from the police cars. However, the Batsuit's retractable wings is a brilliant idea.Gotham City still is a Gothic, dark, disturbing and postmodern metropolis. But the atmosphere is different somehow. The action of the film is set during the Christmas period, which is even more bizarre. We could almost assert that it's some kind of test from Burton's part before the director would launch himself into the production of The Nightmare Before Christmas. At one certain moment in the movie, we even see sunlight, which didn't happen at all in the first movie.The dialog is sometimes bizarre, should it be intentional or not. It can lead to lengthy, boring and disconcerting scenes. But there also are grandiose lines, such as the one where the Penguin distorts the most famous line from David Lynch's movie Elephant Man. And we must not forget that scene where Catwoman meows in front of Batman and the Penguin, just before the store behind her blow up.I also loved the scene where Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle become aware of each other's respective alter ego.

So I figured I would give a rent and see what it was about. While the dialog is extremely cheesy and a bit over done, I have to admit, I was... shudder... touched. It's silly, I'm not into the over romantic type of movies, but actually I have to admit that this was a good one. Untamed Heart gets under your skin and if you open yourself up to it, I'm sure you'll find yourself falling for it as well.Caroline doesn't have the happiest love life. Every boyfriend of her's dumps her and mistreats her; she's just a simple waitress who doesn't finish much of what she starts. One night coming home late from work, she is attacked by two men and is almost raped, but is saved by Adam, a bus boy that works with her. Slowly Caroline and Adam develop a strong love for each other, but Caroline learns a strange secret that Adam was a weak baby and was given the heart of a baboon. When he is attacked by the men who tried to rape Caroline, the doctors warn her that he is in danger of his heart, but all Adam wants is to have his heart full of love from Caroline.Untamed Heart is pretty much flawless, I'm sure that you'll enjoy it. It's very sweet and a loving film that anyone could get into. Even I got into it, which once again I say is weird, you're reading a comment from the only girl on Earth who hated The Notebook.

The movie was great because it was about lies, love, & betrayal. The thing that made the movie great is when De Niro is having flashbacks throughout the whole movie. The whole movie was great but i only had one problem with one scene, when Elizabeth McGovern tells De Niro she will leave for Hollywood, & of course he harassed her in the backseat but the whole movie was great. Especially the ending with James Woods when he goes in to the truck, the he went through that slicer because he was upset that all the pain he cause De Niro over 35 years, so he figured why have De Niro kill him & he said  no. That was a great set-up, making u think James Woods was dead when the body's face was burned off.

The movie was great because it was about lies, love, & betrayal. The thing that made the movie great is when De Niro is having flashbacks throughout the whole movie. The whole movie was great but i only had one problem with one scene, when Elizabeth McGovern tells De Niro she will leave for Hollywood, & of course he harassed her in the backseat but the whole movie was great. Especially the ending with James Woods when he goes in to the truck, the he went through that slicer because he was upset that all the pain he cause De Niro over 35 years, so he figured why have De Niro kill him & he said  no. That was a great set-up, making u think James Woods was dead when the body's face was burned off. This movie should have been nominated for many academy awards & win Best Picture, a phenomenal plan & simple.

It is so referenced to society and some of it's scenes are legendary. I was watching I love the 80's and they showed some pretty funny clips, so it was always on my mind to give this movie a look. I finally remembered to rent it at Hollywood Video and watched it last night. Although I'm not sure I laughed as much as others would have, I still liked this film for some reason. Just because I think in one way or another you could relate to it and remember how hard it was being a teenager.We have Stacey and Linda, two hot young high school students who are very sex deprived and look to make this year their best ever. Mike who is chasing after Stacy and looking to have a meaningful relationship with her. Brad, a senior who is looking to make his last year the best but plans turn out to be different when everything turns on him. Then of course we have Jeff Spacolli, the stoner surfer dude who manages to finally let a teacher, Mr. Hand, have his own.Fast Times at Ridgemont High is a classic teen comedy that I would highly recommend. It is all in good fun and was just so much fun to watch. The cast looked like they had so much fun and the movie just looked like a blast to make. It's understandable on why this film's legacy lives on, this was the movie to watch before American Pie and it's always a joy to stick to the original, trust me.

While I realize there is a 3rd movie out that I haven't seen yet, I'll review under the original title...Just from the standpoint of production value, screen writing, and movie making, this movie fails on many levels, though it succeeds on a few as well. What can you expect from a low-budget, B movie? Not much, and it works from the standpoint of production. However, the writing is certainly disjointed, with little in the way of character development...exactly what I'd expect when there is an agenda to a film. I didn't have a problem with the acting...the cast is solid; however, the screenplay in both movies gives the actors little opportunity to really stretch themselves. Because the film is Christian, this is predictable, as you can't very well portray violent chaos of the end times without also breaking some of the ethics which are normally associated with Christianity. In other words, the mistake comes in making this into a G-rated film when the content, even in the most conservative of Bible interpretations, would be R-rated by any measure. So, if the purpose of the movie is to scare people into Christian faith, then the movie should be somewhat scary, right? However, you can't comment on a film adaptation from a book without commenting on the book, or in this case, series of books. There are certainly plenty of Christian materials worthy enough to be made into movies...but not the Left Behind series...and these movies ultimately fail because, while being best-sellers, they are poorly written novels based on bad theology.As a Southern Baptist minister, I confess that the books were a guilty pleasure for me, though I have yet to finish the last two books of the series. I have described them as decent fiction, and if the books would take the point of view that this is one possibility or interpretation of the subject of biblical eschatology (study of the end times), then I could live with that. However, this series is divisive in Christian circles because it promotes the literalist interpretation of all Scripture above a more proper hermeneutic. Inevitably, this leads to the pre-trib, pre-millenial dispensation point of view, which confines an all-powerful God far too by humanity's world. In other words, as I've always said, God shouldn't need our helicopters and bombs to do his ultimate work. But because many people, particularly unstudied Christians, can't think beyond their own world-views, we are left with a pro-conservative, fundamentalist stance with regard to Bible interpretation, and attempts to push it through as the only interpretation.Thus, the books carry with them an agenda, not so much to get the lost to understand their need for Christ, but to state that the fundamentalist point of view is the only valid way to understand the Bible. I recall very clearly reading (several years ago) in the second novel a scene where the characters reference a person who was left behind BECAUSE of his non-adherence to this point of view; as if real christians worthy to be raptured couldn't possibly hold to another eschatology. This is disturbing for several reasons, the least of which is because a rapture is only briefly mentioned in Scripture and it's connection to real, end-time prophecy is tenuous at best.But the real issue with these books is comes in the way they divide the Christian community and how they portray true Christian behavior. Ultimately, I feel they harden more people to an otherwise legitimate faith\/religion instead of win people towards it. It turns all Christians into caricatures, equally disdained and laughed at by the world despite the fact that there is theological room for a wide diversity of believes within Christian thought and practice. As a Christian body, on the whole, we've done enough of that kind of damage to society over 2000 years of history...and we certainly don't need to promote it by film to thousands, maybe millions of others.Thus, the Left Behind movies fail because the Left Behind books aren't worthy to be interpreted into movies.
