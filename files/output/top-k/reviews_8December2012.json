Most of us never got to experience that. The couple in this film had it once, and got a brief chance to relive it once. That makes twice. Unfortunately the second one was at the expense of others.I thoroughly believed the plot. Some people stay in a small town and some go. Some of those who stay, wonder what would have happened if they left, and some of those who left, wonder the opposite. Ocean City is a real place, not a fictional one. That added to the real feel of the movie.Another reviewer mentioned that Kevin Kline mainly had to look at people with a thoughtful expression. But I say he did that exceptionally well. I'm not sure I buy the character's lack of emotion, in terms of guilt. I would think that a real person would break down at some point. He was so caught up in the euphoria of renewed youth.You don't see Sissy Spacek's character show any signs of guilt. That was disturbing and made me feel less sympathy for her. Maybe she was just a bit self-centered. I think the picture was trying to make the point that she had based her whole life on trying to get what she wanted. In this case, she was not going to let anyone get in her way, or make her feel guilty.Bonnie Bedelia was the quiet quarterback of this one. Her small time on screen was sublime. I did believe her character. She wasn't the temper tantrum type, and she absolutely adored her husband. Yet the pain her facial expressions and tone of voice conveyed was heart-wrenching.The man who plays Spacek's father was simply great. He delivers a great line about how we choose our fate by letting things happen, but it was the way he said it, that I loved.The boy character was quite good too. I think he had a bit of a crush on Spacek's character. Like father, like son. I believed the boy. A nice, semi-nerdy kid, at an awkward age. He played it perfectly.So, some really solid acting, a pleasant setting, a good closing tune sung by a star of the period, who has since passed away, and only a little obligatory Hollywood liberalism thrown in.

It's good old fashioned adventure updated for a contemporary 80s audience. With Jackson's Lord of the Rings' films and his upcoming Hobbit films on the offing, we can look back to a film that tried to tackle similar material with 80's SFX technology, and does an outstanding job.A colleague of mine who was producing and directing rock videos (rap videos too) made the following comment; dude, it was all money... My reply; no it wasn't. The talent amounted for this film may have cost a lot, but money doesn't make a movie. Talent does. The special effects somewhat bordered on calling attention to themselves, as SFX are apt to do because part of their function is to show the audience something they haven't seen before, but they're also very functional. When you blend them with the acting talent of Val Kilmer and Warwick Davis and the rest, you get amazing results.The other thing that I like about this film is that there's no hidden agenda. A lot of fantasy or science fiction sometimes have messages hidden underneath their messages. That is to say some films will appear to comment on one thing, and not just on a superficial level, but try to show or let the audience in on the encoded message, but then have even another message hidden inside of that. Willow doesn't have that. It's a simple story about adventurers who are underdogs coming to bring a fairy tale fantasy to fruition by combating the opposing forces.Queen Bavmorda is that Op-For, with her army led by General Kael, her armed forces hound and dominate this fantasy world. A forward thinking woman, she places her daughter, Sorsha, within the ranks of her army. There is magic, there's hobbit-like or dwarven-like characters coming to the fore as heroes, there're beautiful heroines, bad-boy sword-master heroes, sword-play, heroics and high adventure. One of the real charms about this film is the fact that it doesn't rely on lots of rapid cuts. The action is staged a-la classic Hollywood; you see the action without a cut. It's presented to your eye in its entirety, and that gives the film a kind of almost nostalgic kind of feel, all the while using some of the latest technology to insert elements of fantasy to show the world and extraordinary events and characters that Willow and his band meet. The characters are not stock characters. They are classic heroes, but updated with modern sensibilities, but kept in the time and place from which they originate. Willow has character, his friend has character, the people they meet on the way have their values and faults, and are colorful for it. Allegiances are tested and changed, and the story thrives because of this.Technical remarks; I'm not sure I have any. It would be nice to have a full 8k super-high def presentation of this film, particularly for one scene that, with the current print, the effect in the depopulated Tiras-Leen castle, I think, isn't fully realized by the audience. You had to see the film in the theatre to get what the character is commenting on at that point in the movie. Other technical marks, there's maybe two shots that might have been staged better, but you find that in every film. Some of the finer points of the story also needed to be fleshed out with maybe a scene or two more, but the film functions fine without them.A great family friendly adventure. Definitely worth a night's viewing with a loved one or family, or even by yourself if you're so inclined. Enjoy!

I've always loved Kate Beckinsale, and it's nice to think that people who only know her from those awful Underworld movies may see this and discover she's an actress. Aidan Quinn is also a favorite; even though he tends to be somewhat wooden, I forgive him because he's such an appealing presence. Anthony Andrews is amazing one of those actors that inhabit a role, as they say. And can John Gielgud give a bad performance? I don't think so.The story is great, if a little thin here and here. I won't spoil the plot twists, but at the end you're likely to be left with nagging questions about why certain characters did certain things in light of certain facts that are now known.But don't let that stop you from watching it. In fact, it'll probably encourage you to watch it again. It does me this is one of those movies I'll watch any time it's on cable.btw, of all the movies people have compared this to, nobody's mentioned the similarities to Angels and Insects.

I was surprised when there wasn't as much action in Die Hard 2 as Die Hard. Die Hard's tongue in cheek attitude with mindblowing and intelligent action sequences is the prime formula for an action film done right. So, then I decided that I had to see Die Harder Die Hard 2, which sounded great. So, I rented it and I was a little disappointed. For one, it was completely different that I thought it would be. When I heard that terrorists took over an airport, I expected that terrorists would TAKE OVER the AIRPORT, rather than the control tower and shut off the landing lights, leaving the people inside the terminals (and in the planes, too for some reason) completely oblivious to what's happening. This kind of disappointed me, because there were a lot of good action sequence opportunities lost. Also, even though the first film was tongue in cheek, this one was REALLY tongue in cheek. I mean, they really turned up the heat on satire here! Now onto the real criticisms. Die Hard 2 is actually about McClane in Washington D.C for some reason, who's waiting at Dulles airport on *Christmas eve* for his wife, Holly. But he discovers some punks armed with the woefully fictional Glock 7 pistols who seem to be heavily funded. He tells airport security, but they tell him, who is, might I add, a hero for fighting terrorists, to shove it and wouldn't you know it, terrorists take over the control tower and demand the release of a drug kingpin (that was for some reason flying into Dulles on Christmas eve) or else they will cause all the planes to crash. Now it's up to John to stop the baddies before the planes run out of fuel and crash. There are very few fight scenes in this movie, because most of the suspense comes from a 'race against the clock' feel to the story rather than a life or death situation with guns. Not that this is a bad thing, but it doesn't seem like McClane is the hero until the last 20 minutes. Otherwise he is just running around the runways. In fact, most of this film doesn't even take place in the actual airport! Let's get to the villain. In the first Die Hard, Alan Rickman played a rather suave yet somehow also sociopathic villain Hans Gruber, a German terrorist after money and willing to kill for it. His performance blew me away and he remains one of the greatest villains of all time. The villain in this movie is Colonel Stuart, a man who is supposedly a martial arts expert for some reason, but this is never actually used except for when he is practicing *naked* in a hotel room. Colonel Stuart is a good idea for a villain, but he does not stand out like Rickman's groundbreaking performance. This one is barely even in the movie, and the only really disturbing scene he has is when he pulls a gun on one of his accomplices. I like his character, how he believes in what he is doing and all, but he didn't receive near enough development to be a good villain. Simon from Die Hard with a Vengeance was superior until the film's woozy third act. Even so, there are some pretty serious glaring plot holes that kind of muddle the film's pace. Just to name a few, why wouldn't the planes fly to a different airport, like Reagan? They never explained that! And why could a band of heavily armed mercenaries that could dispatch a SWAT team not kill a guy rolling around with a pistol? It's not that this film isn't believable, it just has problems with logic, which sucks because Die Hard had inevitable problems that were explained in a clear manner. Directed by Renny Harlin (Cliffhanger, Deep Blue Sea), Die Hard 2 delivers the goods, but it doesn't live up to it's predecessor in terms of action scenes, script or character development. It does have fantastic pace, but it isn't even a very similar movie to Die Hard, but I suppose that's why these movies are so great, they are all original in some way. But this film is just too long and too empty to be a worthy sequel to Die Hard. (How could it?) I never checked my watch ONCE in Die Hard, but here, especially during the last half, I checked it a couple times. But at least it tried to be something a little different and more intelligent, which I can appreciate. Here's how these movies are Die Hard Best action film ever made.

The abandonment, similarly, is shown through the knight throughout the film. Having realized his inability to find God, the knight requests to meet Satan, who the knight believes He if anyone must know God, via an alleged witch waiting for execution.

A second US mission is due to head there to find out what happened but an earlier Soviet mission will get there sooner. The leader of the Soviet mission approaches the leader of the original Discovery mission offering them three places on their mission. This isn't an act of détente but a logical step as only the Americans know how to restart HAL, the ship's computer. As they head towards Jupiter tensions between the US and the USSR rise back home in a way that could ultimately affect the mission. When they arrive they see something strange on Europa; signs of life! Something doesn't want Europa investigated though as soon after they see signs of life the probe is destroyed and their recordings erased. HAL isn't the only member of the original crew they meet; Dave is also there; or at least the person who used to be Dave&#x85; he isn't the person he was before though. As they prepare to return to Earth something strange starts to happen to Jupiter meaning they will have to put aside national differences if they are to leave before it is too late.This sequel to the iconic '2001 A Space Odyssey' is a very different film; the story is far more conventional with a larger cast and a more obvious sense of what their mission was. The cast also contains better known actors including Roy Scheider, John Lithgow and Helen Mirram; these actors, as well as the less well known ones, did a fine job. There is more excitement here as well as more tense moments. Strangely this film has dated more than the original since the Cold War is long over and it plays a large part in driving the plot here; we also see more use of some very dated computers! This isn't an important film like the original but it is well worth watching; I think it would be possible to enjoy this even if you haven't seen 2001 although I'd certainly advise watching 2001 first if you can.

Not everyone gets it, but it is plain to see from galleries of fan mail to Emmanuelle Seigner, this one movie part seems to have entrenched her immortality into many men's souls.

ChazzN ","genre":"Drama, Romance, Thriller"},{"date":"8 December 2012","score":"","review":" This is a brief review of If, This Sporting Life, Britannia Hospital and O, Lucky Man!, four films by director Lindsay Anderson.One of the defining films of the British New Wave, Sporting Life revolves around Frank Machin (Richard Harris), a short tempered guy who becomes a star on the rugby circuit. The film's a bit of an anomaly in Anderson's filmography. His later films tend to be stylised satires. Life, though, relies on Anderson's experiences as a run-and-gun documentary filmmaker. Gritty - and a grim portrait of failed relationships, class anxiety and human despair - the film attempts to tap into a certain subset of working class Yorkshire. The film would prove a big influence on Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull. Replace Scorsese's boxing scenes with Anderson's urgent rugby brawls and swap the tough-but-dim Jake LaMotta for the equally tough-but-dim Frank Machin, and you have virtually the same tale. Both also make extensive use of flashbacks, are shot in black and white, are preoccupied with masculinity and personal anguish, feature violent romances, mix poeticism with realism, follow the same narrative progression and are about men who express their inner turmoil through external violence.Where Bull differs from Life is in the latter's attempts to put Frank within a larger society. This is a direct result of a broader shift; from modernism to post-modernism, from art as social engine to art as denying the possibility of progress. In Scorsese's film, Jake LaMotta essentially has no motivation. When at the end of the film LaMotta strikes a wall and yells Why? Why?, Scorsese is equally clueless. I didn't want to give LaMotta any motivations, Scorsese would say in interviews (not quite true; LaMotta is reduced to a Catholic body bag, a suffering Christ who exists to absorb penance for his earthly sins), before going on to state that all motivations are cliché. Reasons? We never discussed reasons! he would tell the New York Times in 1980. Scorsese's dismissal is chilling, but it is the unconscious stance of postmodernity.But understanding is not a cliche, rather it is the essential component of character. La Motta's boiling anger in Scorsese's film does not make him a human being, especially once you've read how articulate and self-analysing LaMotta is in his autobiography. That makes the film, for all its beautiful images, somewhat shallow. Compare this to Life, which has more direct ties to Neorealism. It portrays sporting clubs as the playthings of the wealthy, shows how club owners become Mephistophelian menaces (pretending to be interested in the hero's welfare but actually after his soul), is resoundingly class conscious, portrays the sports community as being intertwined with the mining community, how celebrity and sports are seen to be a form of financial and psychological escape etc etc. Anderson's films are, at their best, rebellions against the inherent conservatism of British culture, akin to the plays of Harold Pinter and Arnold Wesker, and the contemporary working-class novels of John Braine, Alan Sillitoe, Stan Barstow and David Storey, the screen adaptations of which, in the late 50s and early 60s, ushered in a new era of British film and formed the core of what was to be known as the British New Wave.Scorsese's film, however, functions more as a pastiche of New Wave aesthetics, proudly divorced from the social and political motivations of these films. He, like most Hollywood directors of the 1970s who were influenced by the neo realists and new wavers, essentially takes their sexy blood\/violence and drops all context.Of course Scorsese has never spoken of This Sporting Life, but in the late 70s he did mention to David Sherwin that the name of his central character in Taxi Driver, Travis Bickle, had been chosen as a homage to Mick Travis, Malcolm McDowell's character in Lindsay Anderson's If. It should be no surprise, then, that Taxi Driver is essentially a remake of If, now set in New York.If is about life in a highly authoritarian British boarding school. We watch for an hour as teachers, prefects, priests and various other authority figures essentially make the lives of the students miserable. One young man called Mick Travis, however, refuses to put up with this any longer; he finds a stash of guns and, during a long pseudo-real\/pseudo-fantasy sequence at the film's end, guns down the school's staff from a clock tower.It's a great film, more nuanced than my vulgar summary, even though it does, like Taxi Driver, Fight Club and many others, degenerate into a simple revenge fantasy, revolutions - unashamedly cathartic - brought about by bullets and violence. Compare this to fare like The Magdalene Sisters, Jean Vigo's Zero De Conduit or perhaps Clockwork Orange and Zabriskie Point, where the fantasy cliché at the end is reversed and the anarchist is absorbed\/enfolded\/manipulated into the very fabric he lashes out at.Still, you might say that If's bloodbath finale is less problematic than either the climax of Taxi Driver or Fight Club, both of which are almost primordially seductive. Anderson's climax, in contrast, employs both Brechtian distance and a certain fantastical tone which conveys our hero's naivety. This tone hints at the style Anderson would develop further in Hotel Britannia and O, Lucky Man!, both films featuring the Mick Travis character and both featuring highly stylised, highly reflexive worlds. A precursor to Gilliam's Brazil, these dystopian fantasies are likewise about anarchy, revolution and characters rebelling against authority\/social-order. Attempting to portray life in a capitalist society dominated by coffee and biological-weapon producing mega corporations, O, Lucky Man! is the better of the two. Though the two films mark a decline in Anderson's powers, both are interesting.This Sporting Life &#x96; 8.5\/10, If &#x96; 8.5\/10, O, Lucky Man! &#x96; 7.5\/10, Britannia Hospital &#x96; 6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"8 December 2012","score":"","review":" This is a brief review of If, This Sporting Life, Britannia Hospital and O, Lucky Man!, four films by director Lindsay Anderson.One of the defining films of the British New Wave, Sporting Life revolves around Frank Machin (Richard Harris), a short tempered guy who becomes a star on the rugby circuit.
