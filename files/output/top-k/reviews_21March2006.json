All the people around said it was great, but I perfectly knew what they like. They like Aerosmith's song which is indeed great, they like the amazing special effects which had coasted a lot, they like the comedy side of the movie and of course many girls who love Affleck who according to my opinion is a really bad actor who tried not to be one, failed and now he is nothing. And all these things plus the reviews and the ratings I read in internet, gave me a clue the movie would be a huge disappointment since I am a big disaster kind of movies fan. Well, I've been right, but at least I was prepared.The movie is really commercial. It's been said, but I will say it as again. We have over #100 million budget, we have a romance between Hollywood stars Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler and many other famous actors, who are popular with the fact that they rarely agree on becoming a part of the cast of a commercial movie if their names aren't written with big letters on the screen. Such as Billy Bob Thornton and Steve Buscemi which are highly respected actors that I also like a lot. They could play many characters in many different kind of movies. They could improvise, they could turn tasteless lines into hilarious jokes. On the whole, they could turn small movies into really interesting, funny or dramatic motion pictures, people love and will always love. Such as Fargo in Buscemi's case or A Simple Plan - Thornton. And to be honest, I am really disappointed they took part of Armageddon. Thornton plays a smart and refined man involved in politics if I remember correctly. Buscemi is one of the members of the deep core drilling team which is sent to save the world by destroying the asteroid which is about to vanish the world.What I didn't like - well, I guess I've been already understood. I pointed out bad factors. The story is dull, artless and silly. It is so obvious that the movie depends on the effects and the dramatic ending that it's ridiculous. At least movies like Deep Impact and Godzilla have something special that might be considered as art. At least it ain't that obvious that the movie is made of financial purposes. Other than that, bad performances from all the huge stars. The jokes ain't funny, the lines are absurd and sometimes, they doesn't make sense at all. In fact, I recently read that on the stage, Ben Affleck has asked Bay whether it would be easier if they teach astronauts to drill, than drillers to becomes astronauts and Bay's reply has been simply Shut up! which is a really funny story which perfectly shows the creators's desperation.And enclosing, I'll give an explanation why I give 4 to the movie. Well, I like Don't Want to Miss a thing and I was impressed by the special effects which are obviously the only good thing in the movie. The first scene is memorable.

Another good addition is Charlie Korsmo as the delinquent young boy Dick and Tess take under their wing. The colorful other characters are played by Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, William Forysthe, Paul Sorvino, Mandy Patinkin, Madona and other names you know but are too numerous to list here.

It has a solid plot, a magnificent cast, superb dialog and a budget to back all this up. Unfortunately, it is directed by a schizophrenic named Martin Brest. I have no idea if Martin is actually insane or if he just acts like it, but it makes little difference as his movies all turn out the same a good idea with good casting ruined by stupid decisions. He's like a mad scientist that builds a space ship, but then wants to fly it to Oregon to build an Indian casino.This is a frustrating movie as it is always so close to being brilliant, then *POW* out of nowhere, and for no reason, it will turn into the Dukes of Hazard. This is the only film I can think of that I would love to see remade with its original cast. For the latter it is a must see. I can't remember liking DeNiro more than I did in this film, Grodin gives the best performance of his career and is just fantastic, Farina is perfect, Joey Pants is hilarious (I love Pants in almost everything he does mostly because I get the feeling he's not really acting).When the movie works, it relies heavily on the talents of it's actors and the scripts great dialog. It's a very clever and smartly written comedy, but also a keen study of human emotions and relationships. This is probably at it's height in a heart wrenching scene between De Niro and his abandoned 14 year old daughter, a small part played perfectly by Danielle DuClos. The film rapidly deteriorates, however, every time it tries to pick up the action. Cue the goofy b-movie chase music, cue the bullets that just barely miss hundreds of times, cue the national guard sized force that just can't seem to get the job done. Cue dozens of eye rolling clichés and impossible escapes. Martin.... why? I firmly believe that if rather than the cartoonish action sequences, the film would have delved into a gritty, perhaps even frightening realism it could have been AFI top 100 material. The talent was certainly all there.There is no getting around the bad parts of this film, they are too intertwined to avoid, but do not let that stop you from seeing it.

The acting was mediocre and the script was bad. One liners and slang in 1840. People that don't age. A story line that a 12 year old can write. I lost my sword, and suddenly I have another one? You should check out the invitations to the Count's first party! Someone must of sent Photoshop, a computer, and a nice printer back in time.James Caviezel and Dagmara Dominczyk did a credible job of playing their roles, but I can't say as much for any other actors. Some of the settings were appropriate and well made. That's about all this movie has going for it.Not only was the dialog bad, but the plot was unbelievable. The movie kept jumping from one moment to the next, without any type of continuality.I find it very ironic that the average rating was 7.5 here. I'm very easy to entertain and normally don't pick apart movies. Trust me, this is an exception. However, it might be fun to have a get together to laugh at this one. So, if you're in the mood for a movie you can laugh at (even though it's not a comedy) and say I could of made a better movie, and I don't know how to make a movie!, pick this one up.I should note that I finished the book a couple of days ago.

This is the second of seven films that Robert Redford would star in for director Sidney Lumet which would include This Property Condemed, The Way We Were, Three Days of the Condor, The Electric Horseman, Out of Africa and Havana. John Milius adapted his screenplay principally from the novel Mountain Man by Vardis Fisher and segments of the book Crow Killer by Robert Bunker and Raymond Thorp. Jerimiah Johnson is the fictionalized account of an real life mountain man John Johnston whose life itself was more legend than fact. Johnston was born John Garrison who served in the Navy during the Mexican American War and deserted after striking an officer. He changed his name to John Johnston and worked in the west cutting wood for the riverboats. His wife was an Apsaroke, river Crow who was killed by a raiding war party of mountain Crow warriors. Johnston swore vengeance by dedicating his life to killing Crow warriors and in a symbol of completing the cycle of revenge he would allegedly eat part of their liver thus earning him the name Liver Eating Johnson (the t was dropped as mountain men passed his name around.) He somehow enlisted in the Union Army and late in his life became a deputy sheriff in Colorado and a the first town Marshall of Red Lodge, Montana where he served several terms before dying in Los Angeles at the age of 76. So is a brief outline of the real character but this film only uses part of the story (thankfully, Redford doesn't go around eating human livers) in a mythic western tale of man among the elements turning his back on society. In the cast is Will Geer in support but the rest of the cast are mostly unknown or lesser known character actors including Josh Albee, Delle Bolton, Stefan Gierasett, Allyn Ann McLerie, Charles Tyner and Joaquin Martinez. A good music score accompanies the beautiful scenic imagery in this interesting film that really has no ending. Even with a beard Redford might be too good looking to be an effective mountain man.

Well today, it could look easy with the development of computers and more and more sophisticated filming methods. But if there is one thing that is even more difficult, it's to proceed to the mixing at the point that it becomes homogeneous and where the unreal merges into the reality with an extreme subtlety.The year is 1988. Computer animation still is at a prehistoric level and the only way to do the famous live-action\/animation mix, it's to shoot all live scenes and to add the animated scenes one by one. To make a feature-length movie that way could look crazy and utterly visionary, but producers Frank Marshall and Robert Watts decided to take their chance and hired Robert Zemeckis and Richard Williams, so they would direct what has become one of the greatest gems in cinema history.Who Framed Roger Rabbit begins with an almost-completed animated short film starring Baby Herman and Roger Rabbit. However, when the director (cameo by Joel Silver) shouts cut!, the film's wizards enter into action.The story is set in Los Angeles in 1947 and pretends to be some new form of film noir. Every film noir story needs an hard-boiled detective and this one is no exception with Eddie Valiant, perfectly played by Bob Hoskins.Valiant doesn't like the Toons which live in Toontown, an isolated borough somewhere in L.A., but he accepts an offer which gives him the mandate to spy on nightclub owner Marvin Acme and Roger's wife, the hypnotizing femme fatale Jessica Rabbit.What Eddie doesn't suspect is that he just got embarked into a palpitating adventure, filled with murder, lies and big-money business. Then you add the terrifying Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd) and a conspiracy inspired from a real-life urban legend.Who Framed Roger Rabbit is at the same time an homage and a parody of classic noirs from the 40s and the 50s and contains classic elements and others intended to provoke laughs and frenzy for the viewers who could only leave the theater with an open smile on their faces.Directing a film noir is already complicated enough, so imagine if you have to add animated characters inside. Fortunately, Robert Zemeckis clearly shows that he's the man for such a feature. Zemeckis shows that he has an overflowing imagination and he visibly has fun in making this movie.What more, Zemeckis et Williams use a technique and a philosophy both borrowed to Walt Disney himself  what's difficult isn't avoidable and even desirable. Both directors never try to simplify their task and the actors react with an immaculate professionalism, especially those who directly interact with Toons.The very complicated plot, the nihilistic environment and the lighting methods are worth the greatest noirs, but some characteristics (such as Valiant's shadow saying Bless you after the detective sneezes) attenuate this sinister landscape and make the film more attracting to people of all ages.But the main problem with the movie is precisely about the targeted audience. There is no doubt that Roger Rabbit is an adult film. But I have no doubt that some mature movie buffs will believe that it's a kiddie flick, just because of the Toons' presence. And this is definitely not a children's movie. The story is way too complicated, there's enough sex and violence to unleash an outcry and Judge Doom can become so disturbing that he could worry youngsters.However, I encourage adults to see this movie because they would bitterly regret it if they miss their chance. Adding to the already-mentioned elements are the brilliantly orchestrated action sequences by Zemeckis and his crew. The wild chase with Benny the Cab is stirring and the final battle in the warehouse gave me fun like I've rarely had before.Anyway, the entire movie gave me fun like I've rarely had before. It would take an entire dictionary in order to find all the appropriate terms to describe Roger Rabbit. But words aren't necessary. You just need to watch it to experience a goofy orgasm which is the apotheosis of the live-action\/animation mix.

There is no doubt that Roger Rabbit is an adult film. But I have no doubt that some mature movie buffs will believe that it's a kiddie flick, just because of the Toons' presence. And this is definitely not a children's movie. The story is way too complicated, there's enough sex and violence to unleash an outcry and Judge Doom can become so disturbing that he could worry youngsters.However, I encourage adults to see this movie because they would bitterly regret it if they miss their chance.

","genre":"Animation, Comedy, Crime"},{"date":"21 March 2006","score":"","review":" If there is one thing that is difficult, it's to mix live actors with animated characters. Well today, it could look easy with the development of computers and more and more sophisticated filming methods. But if there is one thing that is even more difficult, it's to proceed to the mixing at the point that it becomes homogeneous and where the unreal merges into the reality with an extreme subtlety.The year is 1988. Computer animation still is at a prehistoric level and the only way to do the famous live-action\/animation mix, it's to shoot all live scenes and to add the animated scenes one by one. To make a feature-length movie that way could look crazy and utterly visionary, but producers Frank Marshall and Robert Watts decided to take their chance and hired Robert Zemeckis and Richard Williams, so they would direct what has become one of the greatest gems in cinema history.Who Framed Roger Rabbit begins with an almost-completed animated short film starring Baby Herman and Roger Rabbit. However, when the director (cameo by Joel Silver) shouts cut!, the film's wizards enter into action.The story is set in Los Angeles in 1947 and pretends to be some new form of film noir. Every film noir story needs an hard-boiled detective and this one is no exception with Eddie Valiant, perfectly played by Bob Hoskins.Valiant doesn't like the Toons which live in Toontown, an isolated borough somewhere in L.A., but he accepts an offer which gives him the mandate to spy on nightclub owner Marvin Acme and Roger's wife, the hypnotizing femme fatale Jessica Rabbit.What Eddie doesn't suspect is that he just got embarked into a palpitating adventure, filled with murder, lies and big-money business. Then you add the terrifying Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd) and a conspiracy inspired from a real-life urban legend.Who Framed Roger Rabbit is at the same time an homage and a parody of classic noirs from the 40s and the 50s and contains classic elements and others intended to provoke laughs and frenzy for the viewers who could only leave the theater with an open smile on their faces.Directing a film noir is already complicated enough, so imagine if you have to add animated characters inside.

","genre":"Animation, Comedy, Crime"},{"date":"21 March 2006","score":"","review":" I am quickly becoming aware of the power that Jim Sheridan has behind the camera as well as in crafting genuine non-Hollywood films. As I watched In the Name of the Father unfold, I continually was impressed by the passionate camera angles, the conviction of the characters, and Sheridan's ability not to sway from his own personal heritage. From the opening sequences of this film to the amazing direction to the dedicated actors, I knew that In the Name of the Father was going to be more than just your typical political courtroom drama. It wasn't until the film was finished that I realized Sheridan's power. I speak very highly of him in the opening of this review because I believe that if any other director would have been at the helm of this project that the final cut would not have been as immaculate. Typically with films of this nature we, as audience members, fall prey to there needing to be some sympathy for the opposing country. The British did unfairly treat the Irish in this film, but I believe any other director would have chosen a neutral ground instead of forging headfirst like Sheridan chose to do. I believe any other director would have focused more perversely on the courtroom drama aspect of this film instead of the compelling family epic that was being forged within the walls of Gerry's prison. Due to Sheridan, the masterpiece known as In the Name of the Father was crafted with genuine passion and superb direction.For a film of this high of emotion and intensity to work, there needed to be key players involved that knew how to handle the truthfulness of it all. Sheridan hit a bulls-eye with Daniel Day-Lewis in the key role of Gerry Conlon (which I think most directors do when they choose to hire one of our greatest cinematic heroes), but it was the surprise performance by the typical secondary character actor Pete Postlethwaite that shook me to the core. I have seen quite a bit of films that used the talent of Pete Postlethwaite, but I must admit, this is the first time that I have seen him take control of his character and give it his full devotion. Perhaps it was the dedication that Daniel Day-Lewis had to his character that rubbed onto the other actors, or again, maybe it was just the skillful direction of Jim Sheridan, but I will be the first to say that Postlethwaite stole this film. He didn't just capture the individual scenes in which he was present, but he embodied this entire film. Postlethwaite's father figure was there for his son, he put himself in danger for his son, and most importantly he taught his son the truth of the world. He was phenomenal in the small role that eventually captured the entire film. It is the belief of this reviewer that Pete should have been awarded for an Oscar for this role, instead of Tommy Lee Jones. I was also impressed with John Lynch whom I had only seen in some smaller roles since this. He fully embodied the frightened youth that didn't know better than to finger his friends to save his life. Then there was Emma Thompson. She was subtle in this film. Her role was short, sweet, and to the point, which I think is another prime example of why Sheridan's direction is so acute.I have not read Proved Innocent, but I do not think that Sheridan went too far off course with his adaptation. The story is what kept me glued to the screen. I knew from the awards that In the Name of the Father was honored with that it was great in the direction and acting respects, but it wasn't until I watched the entire film that I realized the power of the story. We don't watch Gerry grow up. We don't see his dysfunctional relationship with his father. We don't see the impeding chaos in Britain. We don't see a lot of back items that would have taken this film into the three-hour zone. Instead, Sheridan crops the film into three distinct moments. Those are Gerry prior to jail, Gerry and his father in jail, and finally, Gerry gaining the wisdom from his father. I enjoyed the fact that Sheridan didn't focus so intently on the trial, but instead the growth of Gerry and the developing relationship between him and father. It was like watching a child grow before our eyes. The only disappointment that I had with the overall story was the quickness of the ending. I do believe Sheridan could have traveled it out for another twenty minutes to give us the full effect of the climactic courtroom scene, or those moments when Gerry decides to learn about British law himself. I just felt that the last half-hour seemed to fly by because there were so many loose ends to tighten.Overall, I thought this film (despite the quickness of the ending) was engrossing to watch and exciting to see. It frightened me to watch it in a post-9\/11 world because it makes us question our current government's hastiness to find answers and make executive decisions. It makes you wonder about the detainees of Iraq and if we, as a nation, are not discovering that our government is jailing the innocent. Sheridan successfully brings the emotions of aggravation and frustration to the peak of the screen with the events surrounding the Conlon family. He makes you feel for these innocent bystanders living in a corrupt nation. It made me happy to have the father that I currently have and appreciate the wisdom that he has handed down to me. Family is one of the most important elements in your life, and I believe that what Sheridan was trying to demonstrate with this film is that until you accept that, you will never find stability and security.Grade **** out of ***** ","genre":null},{"date":"21 March 2006","score":"","review":" I am quickly becoming aware of the power that Jim Sheridan has behind the camera as well as in crafting genuine non-Hollywood films.

I even disagree with the reviewers who lump the film in the so bad it's good category. I think Surf Nazis Must Die is simply good.In comparison to many of its low budget contemporaries, the writing in SNMD is positively Shakespearian. The film has some semblance of a plot, the jokes are actually funny and the action is well paced. Most surprisingly, the film has a bizarre feel-good quality, which could almost be described as wholesome (if you look past the violence, sex and foul language). This is largely due to film's sympathetic heroine, the awesome Eleanor Washington, who vows to single-handedly take out the members of an evil beach gang (the titular surf Nazis) after they kill her beloved son.In addition to Eleanor, the film's minor characters also have a lot to offer. Smeg's relationship with his mother is hilarious and the surf Nazis are wonderfully tasteless, with members being named after Nazi luminaries. The director makes several very obvious references to A Clockwork Orange, but despite their eye make-up and swastikas, these gang members are about as chilling as the Goonies.The inevitable bloodshed is rather low key and the gore effects are simplistic at best. However, the innovative use of hooks and speedboats more than makes up for any lack of carnage. Unlike many zero budget action films, SNMD does not rely on blood splatter or gratuitous sex to pass the time - which under normal circumstances I would consider to be a huge failing.

You watch it thinking these characters need your guidance. I sat wanting to interfere with them, shake them out of the delirium they had fallen into; you really end up caring about them. They generate so much venerability its so painful to see their ultimate demise.The element that stood out the most for me was the drug montage. The images of the pupils dilating and the sounds that accompanied the sequence was so direct and fast that it portrayed the trios loss of control very well. The scenes with Sara are heart-wrenching. She just exudes so much pathos its a real blow to the guts watching her spiral downwards. The speech she gives to her son Harry about being old and alone is touching in a strange way; she sounds whiny,almost pathetic, but you can see she is on the edge of hysteria so it is also frightening and Harry's reaction in the taxi is stunning. You get a chance to see his humanity here. When buying the television for his mother its just a cheap ploy to try and make up for being a bad son, ultimately its an empty gesture, but when he breaks down in the taxi we see he does truly care for his mother; he fears for her and genuinely wants to do something to make her better but his inability to cope with so much emotion leads to him shooting up in said taxi and after the 'drug montage' which makes this movie so memorable, we see him cold, composed and never quite so emotional for another person again.The fridge for me added some interesting dark humor. Its uneasily funny when it jumps about, grows a mouth and tries to eat Sara but it is Sara's reaction to the hallucinations that turn it from humorous to frightening. I thought the acting was brilliant from all, and the story was very strong, however Tyrone's relationship with his mother, as seen in the flashbacks, was not really needed. I didn't think this aspect was delved into enough to make it truly important. At the end, its difficult to say who came out worse. Out of all the characters, you get the feeling that only Tyrone will come out of it OK. Being in prison has acted like a rehab; he's forced to go cold turkey and after whats happened to Harry you think he'll be straight once he gets out. He will get on with his life.Sara's mind has been so destroyed she isn't aware of her circumstance (ignorance is bliss after all)and so consequently she removes herself from it all. Plus she may be mad, but she isn't lonely anymore. She has constant company living in the psychiatric ward and people to care for her; Marion is more difficult, she's now relying on entertaining the sexual desires of 'Little John' in order to fund her addiction and honestly there seems to be no end in sight for her. Harry is in a similar predicament; losing an arm has saved his life, but hes also lost his mother and his love. Personally I felt Harry was worse off, because Marion become detached from herself (not unlike Sara) she seems cold and unemotional, whereas Harry still 'feels'; he still needs or wants (difficult to tell) Marion but he knows shes lost to him.

You watch it thinking these characters need your guidance. I sat wanting to interfere with them, shake them out of the delirium they had fallen into; you really end up caring about them. They generate so much venerability its so painful to see their ultimate demise.The element that stood out the most for me was the drug montage. The images of the pupils dilating and the sounds that accompanied the sequence was so direct and fast that it portrayed the trios loss of control very well. The scenes with Sara are heart-wrenching. She just exudes so much pathos its a real blow to the guts watching her spiral downwards. The speech she gives to her son Harry about being old and alone is touching in a strange way; she sounds whiny,almost pathetic, but you can see she is on the edge of hysteria so it is also frightening and Harry's reaction in the taxi is stunning. You get a chance to see his humanity here. When buying the television for his mother its just a cheap ploy to try and make up for being a bad son, ultimately its an empty gesture, but when he breaks down in the taxi we see he does truly care for his mother; he fears for her and genuinely wants to do something to make her better but his inability to cope with so much emotion leads to him shooting up in said taxi and after the 'drug montage' which makes this movie so memorable, we see him cold, composed and never quite so emotional for another person again.The fridge for me added some interesting dark humor. Its uneasily funny when it jumps about, grows a mouth and tries to eat Sara but it is Sara's reaction to the hallucinations that turn it from humorous to frightening. I thought the acting was brilliant from all, and the story was very strong, however Tyrone's relationship with his mother, as seen in the flashbacks, was not really needed. I didn't think this aspect was delved into enough to make it truly important. At the end, its difficult to say who came out worse. Out of all the characters, you get the feeling that only Tyrone will come out of it OK. Being in prison has acted like a rehab; he's forced to go cold turkey and after whats happened to Harry you think he'll be straight once he gets out. He will get on with his life.Sara's mind has been so destroyed she isn't aware of her circumstance (ignorance is bliss after all)and so consequently she removes herself from it all. Plus she may be mad, but she isn't lonely anymore. She has constant company living in the psychiatric ward and people to care for her; Marion is more difficult, she's now relying on entertaining the sexual desires of 'Little John' in order to fund her addiction and honestly there seems to be no end in sight for her. Harry is in a similar predicament; losing an arm has saved his life, but hes also lost his mother and his love. Personally I felt Harry was worse off, because Marion become detached from herself (not unlike Sara) she seems cold and unemotional, whereas Harry still 'feels'; he still needs or wants (difficult to tell) Marion but he knows shes lost to him. Thats the thing about this movie; it makes you think on a number of levels. Not about wider issues perhaps, other than drug culture, but it makes you feel more than anything else.

Both athletes, of course, dream of becoming pro players some day. There are hundreds of similar tales each season - of great players, mostly black - who don't make it through college or even to college despite their enormous talents and one can get idea of some of the obstacles by watching these two guys.Gates is recruited by St. Joe's, a powerhouse Catholic School which claims Isaiah Thmas as it most famous cage alumnus. There, Gates plays for a typically gung-ho coach and has a lot of ups and downs, both on and off the court. However, he's a lot more mature than the other subject of the documentary Agee.Agee also is recruited by the private school but can't pay the tuition and is kicked out in his sophomore year. He then returns to his neighborhood public school and eventually becomes a star.Gates graduates and goes on to Marquette while Agee attends a junior college. From that point, a summary at the end of the film brings you up-to-date on what happened to the kids.Thus, almost all of the three hours is devoted to these kids form junior high through high school. The families and friends of these athletes are interesting and the film really documents the different lifestyles between blacks and whites in the USA.It's a fascinating picture for people of any race. For non-blacks, it shows them a window into a whole different world. This film is obviously not just to highlight basketball players but to show life as it exists with a lot of poor black families the good and the bad, the achievements and the big mistakes. I enjoyed it just as much the second time as the first. It's one of the better documentaries I've ever seen, so don't let the length of it discourage you.

All the people that jimmy meets are fantastic and in all the ways they help him and all the different advice that they give him is great but also very funny at times.

Straight had not spoken to his brother, Lyle, in 10 years. When Lyle suffered a stroke, Alvin decided that it was time to make amends, for he had long forgotten what had made him angry with his brother, who lived in Wisconsin. Alvin's eyes were too bad to permit him to drive, and he didn't trust public transportation, so he rigged up his mower with a trailer and several weeks worth of supplies, and headed out. He drove days, and camped nights in cornfields.Veteran actor Richard Farnsworth is TOTALLY, TOTALLY EXCELLENT as Alvin Straight. He is warm, wise, compelling, patient, kind. He is clear-cut, simple in his delivery. He makes you feel like he's enveloping you in sunny warmth as he imparts bits of wisdom to you, or tells you a tale. This guy is really genuine. He did win a Best Actor nomination for his performance.Along the way, his character comes across an interesting assortment of strangers, several of whom are sort of typical weird David Lynch out-of-left-field characters...yet who all have a strange degree of compassion, for David Lynch folk. (There are no sexually violent psychopaths, for example.) This movie could have been full of maudlin clichés about family, life experience, old age, war--but all topics are approached just perfectly, with the best choice of words. During Alvin's encounters with these various originals, you pause for a moment to reflect on your own life and values.Different layers of Alvin's life are unfolded slowly before you during his conversations, each a little gift you unwrap. There's his daughter, Rose (Sissy Spacek), with whom he lives, who is thought to be mentally retarded but in fact has a speech impediment. There's a secret he's carried since WWII. There are just factoids here and there about his life, all told in such an interesting fashion. Each person with whom he interacts similarly reveals interesting aspects of his\/her life, like an exchange of presents. David Lynch beautifully demonstrates the slowness of the journey without being tedious, through breathtaking Iowa landscapes. You feel like Straight is just taking his trip one day at a time, not trying to force it. The whole time you're really rooting for him to make it to his brother's house in time, yet you also feel like if his brother isn't there, you won't consider the journey wasted or fruitless.This movie was really uplifting in this time of hurricane-related misery. It made me feel like there are many out there with plenty to offer in terms of unconditional love, random acts of kindness, good advice. You just have to make it your duty to find them. I love this film, and think Richard Farnsworth was a perfect choice for the lead.I think religious moviegoers will like this movie, too, because there's no cursing, and there's a lot about family, friends, and kindness in this flick.
