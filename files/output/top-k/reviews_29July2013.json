[{"date":"29 July 2013","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" ***warning contains spoiler***I feel some of the reviews of this film were too critical. There were mentions that it contained 'plotholes' - in reference to the end - which I feel forced an overlook to the actual raw performance and tension build up within the film.Jeff Bridges is one of my favourite American actors - a bit of an actor's actor - and he doesn't disappoint with this terrorist thriller. The ending which has been quite heavily slated could have been misinterpreted by those criticising it. Even if Jeff hadn't reached the FBI offices with the bomb in tow, the explosion would have had a big impact wherever detonated and Jeff would have been named a terrorist either way, as there was no one with substantial evidence to otherwise defend him and Jeff (having remained in the car) would be dead.Overall, I felt the suspense was well maintained and the '8' I've rated it was probably slightly generous, however I was well satisfied with the majority of the plot and would recommend the movie to the thrill-seekers of the film industry who have already indulged upon the classic thrillers.
