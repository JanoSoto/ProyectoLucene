The direction and cinematography and editing are as look-at-me slick, stylish and gimmicky as the most 80's of music videos. But oh my goodness the plot. I came to this comments board after seeing the film hoping, once my laughter had subsided, to make the obvious drugs are bad m'kay jokes, mock the ludicrous plot, and point out that this film outdoes Reefer Madness for camp, self-parodying counterproductive hyperbole. But I see plenty of others have beaten me to the punch in stating the obvious. This film is the Monty Python Salad Days skit writ large. Try drugs, and you will end up getting your infected arm amputated, your game-show-addicted mother will get shock treatment in a loony bin after trying to slim down to fit into her red dress, and funniest of all, your white girlfriend will be forced to fellate over-endowed black men and have foreign objects inserted into her anus at orgies in exchange for drugs.

Except that they would have cast Divine as both the mother and girlfriend if they had been directing, and they would have called it something like Naked Flamingoes from Outer Space rather than given it the pretentious title that it actually had. And they wouldn't have taken it all quite so seriously. Watching this film, I honestly expected a Ron Jeremy cameo at any minute. The whole plot sounds like one of his Catskills routines, complete with long-suffering Jewish mothers doting on their disappointing sons.

Super Troopers is the film that brought the group into the mainstream consciousness. The jokes may be crude, the humor a little lowbrow, but the movie as a whole is just plain funny.

They write it all together and go out in front of the camera to make the audience laugh, even if that viewership consists solely of them. Not quite a pot comedy, nor a strict spoof on law enforcement, Super Troopers is a grab-bag of laughs that come often and fast, disguising a flimsy premise with its flash, one-liners, and shenanigans.I will admit that I'd love this film if the final hour was acted out by sock puppets&#151;that's how good the first scene is.

And the writer is able to tell you absolutely everything that man feels about entering that room in a mere five words.Now, say the writer takes five sentences to tell you the same thing because he wants to tell you what is in the room. Or say it takes him five paragraphs, because he not only tells you what furniture is in the room, but goes into minute detail about the color and the fabric of the upholstery and the grain of the wood and the design of the carpet and the images imprinted on the wallpaper. But what if he takes five pages as he writes about where the trees were grown that rendered the wood and the wallpaper; and where the sheep were raised for the wool for the carpet and the upholstery, and how much everything cost, and where it was bought and by whom and on what day and etc., etc.Now, those final five pages might be eloquently written, accurately detailed and maybe even fascinating in their own right, but somewhere between five poetic words and five rambling pages the narrative ceased to be about the man and instead becomes all about the room -- and not even about the room, but rather about the research the writer did in order to describe the room. Historical trivia takes the place of human emotion. That pretty much sums up the folly known as HEAVEN'S GATE, a slight, potentially meaningful tale lost amid a display of self-aggrandizing, ego boosting pseudo-scholarship.Michael Cimino's obsession with detail in making the film is legendary -- right down to insisting that era-appropriate underwear be worn by the extras. The writer\/director bragged about how such details couldn't actually be seen but could be sensed -- by him if no one else. Of course, such details don't come cheap, whether in time or money or effort; and his manic need to make everything seem accurate and honest was responsible for making HEAVEN'S GATE one of the most expensive films ever made up to its time. The irony is that, though the trivial details might be right, everything else is wrong and that is why HEAVEN'S GATE became the biggest critical and financial flop up to its time. What was supposed to be a faithful recreation of a piece of Americana became instead a ponderous tour of a cluttered, dusty warehouse of arcane bric-a-brac.Of course, a desire for authenticity is all well and good, and is generally to be applauded; but in this film's case it just seems like hollow hypocrisy in light of just how dishonest the rest of HEAVEN'S GATE is. For one thing, the film supposedly documents the Johnson County War, a nasty little range war in Wyoming in 1892. A few people died unjustly and the federal government had to step in to calm things down. It could be the basis for a decent little movie -- or at least a 30-minute episode of Death Valley Days. In Cimino's hands, however, the war ended up being a tale of the mass slaughter of hordes of nameless, faceless immigrants, building to a major battle rivaling anything in the Civil War. Little of his bombastic version has anything to do with historical fact.Okay, Hollywood long ago gave up any attempt, let alone claim to historical accuracy (see John Ford's THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE for insight), but usually it came with the suggestion that trading fact for fiction would reveal a greater truth. HEAVEN'S GATE fails here too. Though built around a nominal love story -- good guy and bad guy love the same woman -- HEAVEN'S GATE is all too obviously a heavy-handed anti-American, or at least anti-capitalism, allegory. The rich cattle barons (American capitalists) are evil; the poor immigrants (the Third World) are pathetic little victims. It is the same pompous propaganda Hollywood often embraces, though Cimino seems to think it is an original insight. But, as is the case with so much Hollywood liberalism, it isn't even Rich versus Poor or Oppressor versus Oppressed; rather it is Rich Conservative versus Rich Liberal. Though he crowds his frames with teeming masses longing to be free, as Cimino depicts them they blend into a pitiable mass, indistinguishable as individuals. Few of the immigrants are even given names, let alone identities.Cimino no doubt thought he was speaking out against injustice, but his view of the poor is soured by condescension, they aren't important except as a concept, a symbol of a liberal indignation. Rather than focusing on one or more of the poor fighting for dignity, his chosen hero is Kris Kristofferson's James Averill, a rich, educated, liberal do-gooder from the East who turns against his wealthy brethren in the name of the immigrants. HEAVEN'S GATE doesn't recognize the humanity of the poor, but rather salutes the arrogance of those who pity them.Cimino rode into HEAVEN'S GATE on a tidal wave of acclaim created by the success of his masterpiece, THE DEER HUNTER. Faced with the need to prove that DEER HUNTER wasn't a fluke, and that he really was a genius, Cimino no doubt immersed himself in the endless preparation and the tedious search for detailed perfection just as a way of avoiding actually completing the movie. Like the filmmaker, the film never really seems motivated to even get started, and hustle and bustle are substituted for actual drama. Thus, the film plods along, expecting the viewer to be inspired by the majesty of the Wyoming locations, to absorb the wisdom in the banal, long-winded dialogue and to be in awe of the authenticity of all the production design. But, it is like a bad joke with no punch line, there ultimately is no point. And Cimino ends up saying nothing other than See how hard I tried.

And the writer is able to tell you absolutely everything that man feels about entering that room in a mere five words.Now, say the writer takes five sentences to tell you the same thing because he wants to tell you what is in the room. Or say it takes him five paragraphs, because he not only tells you what furniture is in the room, but goes into minute detail about the color and the fabric of the upholstery and the grain of the wood and the design of the carpet and the images imprinted on the wallpaper. But what if he takes five pages as he writes about where the trees were grown that rendered the wood and the wallpaper; and where the sheep were raised for the wool for the carpet and the upholstery, and how much everything cost, and where it was bought and by whom and on what day and etc., etc.Now, those final five pages might be eloquently written, accurately detailed and maybe even fascinating in their own right, but somewhere between five poetic words and five rambling pages the narrative ceased to be about the man and instead becomes all about the room -- and not even about the room, but rather about the research the writer did in order to describe the room. Historical trivia takes the place of human emotion. That pretty much sums up the folly known as HEAVEN'S GATE, a slight, potentially meaningful tale lost amid a display of self-aggrandizing, ego boosting pseudo-scholarship.Michael Cimino's obsession with detail in making the film is legendary -- right down to insisting that era-appropriate underwear be worn by the extras. The writer\/director bragged about how such details couldn't actually be seen but could be sensed -- by him if no one else. Of course, such details don't come cheap, whether in time or money or effort; and his manic need to make everything seem accurate and honest was responsible for making HEAVEN'S GATE one of the most expensive films ever made up to its time. The irony is that, though the trivial details might be right, everything else is wrong and that is why HEAVEN'S GATE became the biggest critical and financial flop up to its time. What was supposed to be a faithful recreation of a piece of Americana became instead a ponderous tour of a cluttered, dusty warehouse of arcane bric-a-brac.Of course, a desire for authenticity is all well and good, and is generally to be applauded; but in this film's case it just seems like hollow hypocrisy in light of just how dishonest the rest of HEAVEN'S GATE is. For one thing, the film supposedly documents the Johnson County War, a nasty little range war in Wyoming in 1892. A few people died unjustly and the federal government had to step in to calm things down. It could be the basis for a decent little movie -- or at least a 30-minute episode of Death Valley Days. In Cimino's hands, however, the war ended up being a tale of the mass slaughter of hordes of nameless, faceless immigrants, building to a major battle rivaling anything in the Civil War. Little of his bombastic version has anything to do with historical fact.Okay, Hollywood long ago gave up any attempt, let alone claim to historical accuracy (see John Ford's THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE for insight), but usually it came with the suggestion that trading fact for fiction would reveal a greater truth. HEAVEN'S GATE fails here too. Though built around a nominal love story -- good guy and bad guy love the same woman -- HEAVEN'S GATE is all too obviously a heavy-handed anti-American, or at least anti-capitalism, allegory. The rich cattle barons (American capitalists) are evil; the poor immigrants (the Third World) are pathetic little victims.

Frankly, the first half of the movie is filled with far too much of two things i) interviews with the talking heads - identified in the credits as witnesses who I guess had known Reed and his love interest Louise Bryant (Keaton), and ii) interminable portrayals of the tempestuous relationship between the two. The title of the movie suggests that the focus of the movie is on the leftist movement, but at times this comes close to being little more than a typical Hollywood romance. The second half of the movie, set mostly in Russia, finally downplays those two problems. There's a depiction of the battle for recognition from the Comintern (Communist International) by two competing U.S. Communist Parties, and we see Reed drafted as a propagandist by the Bolshevik authorities in Moscow.The movie seems to avoid taking a hard position either for or against communism.

He's only good when the part is made for him. Roles that spring to mind include The Devil in The Witches of Eastwick, or The Joker. Two performances where his manic energy was perfectly attuned to the characters written for him. But if he's put into parts not really suited to him, then its not a pretty sight. And I'm thinking of Jack Torrance in The Shining here.In the case of Wolf, the role of a man taken over by animal urges couldn't be more perfect for Jack Nicholson. So its all the more unusual then that he chooses to downplay emotion for the role. Its a bold move, but is it a successful one? Well, when Nicholson cut back on the histrionics for About Schmidt, it was a gamble that paid off. The story of a lonely man who suffers in silence was made all the more remarkable because the man was Jack Nicholson. But I think this only works to variable effect in Wolf.Wolf comes from celebrated director Mike Nichols. A man who dabbles in fantasy cinema from time to time, Wolf was Nichols' attempt to bring the whole werewolf ethos into the 90s. He's not quite as successful as he would be much later on when he adapted Angels in America into an absolutely superb mini-series, but Wolf definitely has its interesting moments.Nicholson plays an ageing book editor bitten by a wolf one night. He slowly begins to sense the changes within himself. Becoming more assertive in his business dealings. Sleeping the day away. Lots of energy at night. And when he gets involved with the daughter of a ruthless publisher, he's not sure how long he can be with her before he loses himself to the wolf completely.Mike Nichols has made a conscious effort to avoid the familiar expectations of the genre. Instead of the usual horror show, most of the story takes place within the real world surroundings of board rooms and bedrooms. In an interesting move, Nichols equates animal instinct with office politics. Nichols explored office rivalry before in the excellent Working Girl, and tries to blend the same approach with the wolf story. To interesting effect.James Spader does what he does best as an ambitious, ladder climbing snake who's after Jack's job. The rivalry between the two, Spader's slick finesse versus Jack's animal magnetism becomes an impressive contrast. In fact its this aspect of the film that really shines. They provide an edge the film may not have otherwise had. It doesn't get any sharper than the scene when Jack announces he's marking his territory...literally by peeing on Spader's expensive shoes.Its when the film outright addresses Nicholson's lycanthropy that Wolf misses the mark. I think because Nichols never really does anything particularly original with it. The scene where Jack murders a deer in cold blood makes an impact, but its nothing we haven't seen a thousand times before in a thousand other werewolf movies. The makeup work from the usually great Rick Baker is surprisingly unremarkable. Just tufty sideburns and yellow contacts. That could be anyone who's just woke up from an all night bender. Its disappointing because Baker provided the astonishing transformation effects for An American Werewolf in London.Also Jack's relationship with Michelle Pfeiffer is not as compelling as it should be. Its nice to see the two of them reunited again, after co-starring seven years previously in The Witches of Eastwick. But Wolf never quite explores the dark seductions of power TWOE did so well. I sensed a lot of missed opportunities here. Pfeiffer could have become fascinated by Jack's wolfish side instead of just mildly bemused by it. She's always at her best when playing femme fatales with an edge, like Catwoman, or the witch Lamia in the underrated Stardust. But Wolf never grants her that chance until its too late.As for Jack Nicholson, I kept waiting throughout the film for him to open up and play to the gallery. But he surprisingly never does. He's not sleepwalking his way through the part. But considering what a larger than life actor Nicholson is, you're wondering why he refuses to cut loose and hang from the rafters. Sometimes when he does the temptation to turn off is great. But I would have liked to see Jack give in to his animal side. It would have given the film some much needed fire. As it is, Wolf is an at times painfully slow film, and all because Jack never sinks his teeth into the part with relish.There's a good twist involving James Spader that I don't want to spoil. But the ending feels conventional really, even if it follows things through to their natural conclusion. Still, Wolf is certainly not a failure. Jack never goes for the role like you think he should.

He slowly begins to sense the changes within himself. Becoming more assertive in his business dealings. Sleeping the day away. Lots of energy at night. And when he gets involved with the daughter of a ruthless publisher, he's not sure how long he can be with her before he loses himself to the wolf completely.Mike Nichols has made a conscious effort to avoid the familiar expectations of the genre. Instead of the usual horror show, most of the story takes place within the real world surroundings of board rooms and bedrooms. In an interesting move, Nichols equates animal instinct with office politics. Nichols explored office rivalry before in the excellent Working Girl, and tries to blend the same approach with the wolf story. To interesting effect.James Spader does what he does best as an ambitious, ladder climbing snake who's after Jack's job. The rivalry between the two, Spader's slick finesse versus Jack's animal magnetism becomes an impressive contrast. In fact its this aspect of the film that really shines. They provide an edge the film may not have otherwise had. It doesn't get any sharper than the scene when Jack announces he's marking his territory...literally by peeing on Spader's expensive shoes.Its when the film outright addresses Nicholson's lycanthropy that Wolf misses the mark. I think because Nichols never really does anything particularly original with it. The scene where Jack murders a deer in cold blood makes an impact, but its nothing we haven't seen a thousand times before in a thousand other werewolf movies. The makeup work from the usually great Rick Baker is surprisingly unremarkable. Just tufty sideburns and yellow contacts. That could be anyone who's just woke up from an all night bender. Its disappointing because Baker provided the astonishing transformation effects for An American Werewolf in London.Also Jack's relationship with Michelle Pfeiffer is not as compelling as it should be. Its nice to see the two of them reunited again, after co-starring seven years previously in The Witches of Eastwick. But Wolf never quite explores the dark seductions of power TWOE did so well. I sensed a lot of missed opportunities here. Pfeiffer could have become fascinated by Jack's wolfish side instead of just mildly bemused by it. She's always at her best when playing femme fatales with an edge, like Catwoman, or the witch Lamia in the underrated Stardust. But Wolf never grants her that chance until its too late.As for Jack Nicholson, I kept waiting throughout the film for him to open up and play to the gallery. But he surprisingly never does. He's not sleepwalking his way through the part. But considering what a larger than life actor Nicholson is, you're wondering why he refuses to cut loose and hang from the rafters. Sometimes when he does the temptation to turn off is great. But I would have liked to see Jack give in to his animal side. It would have given the film some much needed fire. As it is, Wolf is an at times painfully slow film, and all because Jack never sinks his teeth into the part with relish.There's a good twist involving James Spader that I don't want to spoil. But the ending feels conventional really, even if it follows things through to their natural conclusion. Still, Wolf is certainly not a failure. Jack never goes for the role like you think he should. But Wolf brings some interesting dimensions to the werewolf genre, even if it never reinvents it.

Yes the film narrative takes place during a war more specifically the American conflict in Vietnam but it it about neither of those things specifically. It is to my way of thinking a film about our human tendency towards war and how utterly hypocritical said institution is viewed in our modern world. The film is hallucinatory to the point of being almost dream like. It is both pensive and insane. The narrative is more akin to a fairy story than any war film. Alice and Wonderland comes to mind...Willard following the white rabbit down the river to meet the red queen that is Kurtz all the while running into some colorful characters. Its impossible for me to think about this remarkable film with out thinking of two actors and how completely essential components they are to making this one of my all time favorite films. Martin Sheen is a miracle in this film, words cant describe how f^%$# amazing he is. On screen he is both pensive and brooding but its is his narration that is utterly brilliant and it is this narration that glues the myriad facets of this film in place. In many ways Mr. Sheen is Apocalypse Now but he is not the star. The star of this picture is a man who appears on screen only briefly towards the end but whose presence carved out a place in my conscience. That man is Marlon Brando. He is the star for so many reasons not the least of which is that the whole god d%$# thing is about his character. We spend what feels like a week hearing about this guy, the whole film is building to this climax that will surely disappoint. Not only did it exceed what I was expecting but it completely overshadowed the three plus hours that preceded it. If I were to muster any complaints about this film is would perhaps be its pace...it feels like a long film. The version of the film I viewed had it split between two discs and this is appropriate as one might want to take a break. Though I certainly prefer the film in this longer version (redux being a more recent extended cut of the film) and would not want to see anything excised from the film so take my complaint with a grain of salt.

Anyway, this was Moore's fourth James Bond film, after his first two, Live and Let Die and The Man with the Golden Gun, which I think are pretty good, and his third, The Spy Who Loved Me, which is slightly better than its two predecessors, in my opinion. However, I think this fourth outing of his in the Bond movie franchise is inferior to all of the previous three.While headed for the U.K., a space shuttle called the Moonraker is mysteriously hijacked! Who is sent to investigate this deed? Well, James Bond, Agent 007, of course. His mission takes him to the Drax laboratories, run by Hugo Drax, where he meets Dr. Holly Goodhead, a CIA agent and NASA astronaut, who has been sent here to investigate. Bond also sees some suspicious activities happening in the Drax laboratories, and faces a killing attempt! After this, the mission takes both Bond and Goodhead to several different places in the world, and eventually, somewhere out of the world! Unfortunately, Jaws, the giant, strong henchman who can kill people by biting them with his metal teeth, is back, now working for somebody else, and he will make this mission more difficult (like he did with Bond's last mission), appearing in a number of different places! In Roger Moore's first three outings as Bond, I've found excitement and humour. In Moonraker, I once again found both of those, but certainly not as much. For example, in the scene where Bond is in the G-Force simulator, spinning faster and faster (an attempt to kill him), it starts out exciting, but is too long, with the simulator just rather gradually picking up speed more and more. Humourwise, there's the scene where Bond takes M and the Minister of Defense to the lab. All of them enter in gas masks, but it turns out that the lab is no longer there, and Drax acts puzzled as to why they're wearing those masks. While I did find this one mildly amusing, I couldn't figure out why I didn't find it funnier. Like certain other Bond films, tediousness is a problem in this. Also, they decided to bring back the Jaws character, and while he was good in The Spy Who Loved Me, he may get tiring in this movie, though some surprises involving him come towards the end, some of them mildly amusing, silly surprises, though some might not like them.

He is the only weak link in this superlative musical.He just does not cut it as a tough ex-gang member. Everyone else is so perfectly cast its not true! Tamblyn is just great - athletic and balletic at the same time. Chakiris is spot on as Bernardo and Rita Moreno gives the best performance of her life in WSS. The direction, the music(oh the music!!) and the genius lyrics just could not have been better. I saw this as a kid in the 60's and have seen it dozens of times since. it still blows me away. Particular highlights are the America number, Gee Officer Krupke and the Rumble sequence. What never ceases to amaze me is how relevant it still is.

I've always admired the energy and the manner in which director Guy Ritchie doesn't necessarily tell us a brilliant story but does get across a feeling of urgency; a sense of desperate times calling for desperate measures. Lock, Stock very much falls into that mid-late nineties cannon of British crime films revolving around the youth of the day, getting mixed up in criminal activity rather than being out and out gangsters themselves. With Lock, Stock; you don't get the feeling anyone who's under the age of thirty really wants to do what they're doing, it's either for a laugh or because they're forced to.Films such as Shopping and Trainspotting could be seen as precursors to Lock, Stock. They were crime orientated films but crime orientated films about youth getting mixed up in irregular criminal activity such as drug taking, dealing and ram-raiding. They were not gangster films about gangsters per-se like The Krays or Mona Lisa &#150; two films from just before said films' time. However Lock, Stock combines the two ideas of youth involved in crime and the gangster genre as a whole and delivers an experience that has you sit back, put your feet up and enjoy a runtime of smart dialogue and faced paced that still worked on me all these years and viewings later. The film delivers a rapid array of scenes and visual styles more akin to music videos or perhaps even blockbusters as transitions and gimmicks fill up the screen and aid in playing out the events.Along with Snatch. two years later, Ritchie took inspiration from Tarantino's groundbreaking Pulp Fiction and gave British audiences not so much a breath of fresh air like what Tarantino did, but an alternative &#150; an alternative to the stuffy and somewhat clichéd image of the British gangster as a hard bodied man who ran industries and dealt with anyone who crossed him. The best moment that gives us ammunition to read into this is one of the final few scenes in the film in which an unexpected shoot out occurs in a sex shop owner's office. The 'clichéd' image of a gangster character utters the words after a great shock What the (expletive) are you doing here!?. This question is directed at a character of many years his junior and is a question that rings true from all 'stuffy' imagined gangster characters as Lock, Stock arrives the 'lads culture' of the gangster genre has arrived and the old guard cannot believe it &#150; best summed up in that one shoot out nearer the end.But this is just fuel for an oppositional reading and I happen to have enjoyed almost all of the pre-Lock, Stock gangster films that I've seen (Brighton Rock and The Long Good Friday are my favourites). The 'criminals' in this film or at least the protagonists are young, cocky and without too much of a care. They are not criminal kingpins; they do not have an empire to run; they have not served time in jail &#150; they have unspectacular jobs like market salesman or chef and yet they are placed in a situation against forces much higher than them and can only rely on criminal activity that just happens to be on their doorstep to bail them out.A lot of what Ritchie does to tear apart the gangster ideation (both image and genre) is to do with comedy. A lot of the content in this film would never, ever be seen in any gangster film prior to 1998 and a lot of the humour would not be presented as being so light hearted. In this film, a 'psychotic black man with an afro' will sit behind a desk and a wall of screens displaying motorcars whilst sucking on an iced-lolly, something that both challenges what the image of a gangster might be and simultaneously tempts us to laugh at someone of this stature. Indeed when the film threatens to go 'dark' with this character over the volume of a TV in a pub, an amusing voice-over and use of subtitles distracts us from the uneasy conflict on screen. In fact it happens twice; this time the four lads of the film react with a sarcastic holler after the film's soundtrack has died for said psychotic black gangster's emphasised reply of 'No'.Lock, Stock at its core is a guerrilla film but it's a guerrilla film with an ideation of 'yes, it realises what's transpired in the past and now it's going to blow away the cobwebs and do something outrageous.' But as a film and a filmmaker, Ritchie creates enough ambiguity and tension through the job itself (which is well structured they must get through the locked gate, deal with someone hidden in the back, negotiate the disguised girl on the couch and then get away but the comic element of the traffic warden keeps everything 'light') but he also pays close attention to his soundtrack. James Brown's 'The Boss' over Big Chris' looming figure works well as does 'Liar, Liar' as Eddie blags his way through the card game with a light Reggae track over some stoners works equally well.The film evens finds time to dedicate dialogue to the moving away from gangster films gone by. One character buys some guns of another and the seller retorts that sawn-offs are out further moving Lock, Stock away from that old fashioned image of Brit gangsters and their sawn-off shotguns. People want more 'range' these days is another quip &#150; he is right but the range is in the toying with genre conventions. Apart from bending all the rules, Lock, Stock is a fast and furious ride down slapstick gangster alley that, at least for me, still holds up after so many viewings &#150; it's just good fun among other things and Ritchie knows when to keep the film dramatic amongst everything else that happens.

Such was unquestionably the case with legendary writer\/director Billy Wilder and author Raymond Chandler, when paired up to craft a film adaptation of a dark, seedy novel by James M. Caine, dealing with such rich cinematic potential as deception, double-crossing and murder. While the feuding between Wilder and Chandler was legendary, each despising each other's methods and taking any possible opportunity to ridicule each other, their cinematic concoction, Double Indemnity, was even more legendary. One of the most pitch perfect noir thrillers of all time, each component of the film fits together seamlessly to create a flawless slice of dark movie magic which has lost none of its atmospheric punch and poignancy when viewed in a contemporary setting, over sixty years later. Double Indemnity proves unlike any other films of its time, as the film's tension is extracted not from the question of whether or not the lurid scheme of the central characters will succeed, but instead through the sickly knowledge that they are fated not to, inviting the viewer to watch the whole sordid affair unfold, to see each piece fit disastrously into place. From the opening titles, the film positively drips with fatalism between MacMurray's grim voice-over to the sublime noir lighting, all creating a pitch perfect mood of unease and despair. The masterful technical work is matched by the perfectly honed screenplay by Wilder and Chandler, delivering an engrossing treatise on greed, lust and their abilities to ensnare and corrupt while cleverly mixing cynical introspection with snappy banter and the kind of exquisitely stylized lines filmmakers simply could not pull off now (see the dynamic, thinly veiled speeding ticket sexual innuendo exchange between Stanwyck and MacMurray). The idea of walking an audience through the planning and execution of a murder was a virtually unprecedented one, but the ingenious daring of Wilder and Chandler does not stop there. Not only does the film empathize with the murderers, Dietrichson for personal gain and Neff as much to shake up the prescribed order of things as his sordid infatuation with her, but also demonstrates how exhilarating and, crucially, entertaining the act of killing could be. Bathing the viewer in a seedy world of secret encounters, lurid sexual acts and casual violence played up as darkly fascinating as opposed to downright immoral, Wilder and Chandler choose to side with characters who ordinarily would have filled the roles of cinematic villains, with the lawful figure Keyes instead played almost as grotesque antagonist, blithely subscribing to a system revolving around asphyxiating order fated to collapse. Though evil is eventually punished, not only is it seemingly predisposed to overcome good, the film seems to silently state, but it is more interesting anyway - a pitch black, endlessly captivating moral stance which has lost not a shred of potency. The casting of lead character Walter Neff carries a similar parallel story of infamy to the film itself; a series of successful stars passing on the role, concerned about the implications of humanising an unrepentant killer. The final casting choice, perennial nice guy Fred MacMurray playing decidedly against type proved simply brilliant, as MacMurray inhabits the role like a cool leather glove, his fast talking salesman veneer carefully concealing a deadness in his eyes, a forever looming darkness barely veiled. MacMurray accomplishes the truly laudable feat of taking a downright unsavoury character yet still retaining the audiences' sympathies despite each unethical act, perfectly essaying the moral crux of the film. Of course, the simply stunning performance by Barbara Stanwyck as one of the most memorable femme fatale figures of the era proves a lurid highlight, as Stanwyck arguably steals the show with her searing, sultry yet devious intensity, far too charismatic and cunning to ever be reduced to a simple object of desire. The two powerhouse leads are well supported by character actor Edward G. Robinson giving a deliciously repellent performance as an order obsessive insurance agent increasingly suspicious of the insurance scam presented to him.Despite the hefty competition, there can be little doubt that Double Indemnity marks its place as one of the most emotionally gruelling and captivating film noirs of its time, and arguably in the history of the industry. Each flawless element of the film melds together to create a truly mesmerizing work just as grimly entertaining as it is technically laudable.

Though evil is eventually punished, not only is it seemingly predisposed to overcome good, the film seems to silently state, but it is more interesting anyway - a pitch black, endlessly captivating moral stance which has lost not a shred of potency. The casting of lead character Walter Neff carries a similar parallel story of infamy to the film itself; a series of successful stars passing on the role, concerned about the implications of humanising an unrepentant killer. The final casting choice, perennial nice guy Fred MacMurray playing decidedly against type proved simply brilliant, as MacMurray inhabits the role like a cool leather glove, his fast talking salesman veneer carefully concealing a deadness in his eyes, a forever looming darkness barely veiled. MacMurray accomplishes the truly laudable feat of taking a downright unsavoury character yet still retaining the audiences' sympathies despite each unethical act, perfectly essaying the moral crux of the film. Of course, the simply stunning performance by Barbara Stanwyck as one of the most memorable femme fatale figures of the era proves a lurid highlight, as Stanwyck arguably steals the show with her searing, sultry yet devious intensity, far too charismatic and cunning to ever be reduced to a simple object of desire. The two powerhouse leads are well supported by character actor Edward G. Robinson giving a deliciously repellent performance as an order obsessive insurance agent increasingly suspicious of the insurance scam presented to him.Despite the hefty competition, there can be little doubt that Double Indemnity marks its place as one of the most emotionally gruelling and captivating film noirs of its time, and arguably in the history of the industry. Each flawless element of the film melds together to create a truly mesmerizing work just as grimly entertaining as it is technically laudable. For any in search of a taut, hard hitting piece of staunch film-making, few films would prove more fitting than Double Indemnity. -10\/10 ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Film-Noir"},{"date":"25 August 2008","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Bad puns, bad parodies, bad slapstick. This movie is a junk pile compared to Mel Brooks' earlier films, but I like the way it revels in its cheesy, predictable badness. John Candy's self effacing, apologetic Mog with tail always in the way, swatting people in the face, sticking out the back of a bloated spacesuit. Rick Moranis' little doll theater. The pigsty condition of the Winnebago spaceship, off for a road trip with $5 worth of gas in the tank, stopping at an intergalactic diner for a reprise of Alien. Not that much laugh-out-loud humor. Just cheap snickers the whole way through.I enjoyed the sci-fi parodies Dark Star and Mars Attacks more than Spaceballs, but the cheesiness plays pretty well against the polished franchises it mimics. My mom's reaction to Star Wars when it first came out was space cowboys, and there's a lot of truth in that. Underneath all the special effects these films are spiffed up remakes of cheesy, predictable 1930's westerns and serials.

The film was of course very much a product of its time and I am not sure if the more cynical modern audience will get it or like it.

Mankiewicz is not remembered by most today as one of the finest directors in Hollywood history, but this film proves that he is. Already a success by doing sophisticated American dramas such as A Letter to Three Wives and All About Eve as well as successfully adapting Shakespeare to life in Julius Caesar, Mankiewicz does a marvelous job of bringing this hit Broadway play to film and does it with style. Marlon Brando is perfect as Sky Masterson, even if he can't sing too well. He is the only actor who could pull it off perfectly wit his sheer coolness and clarity. Frank Sinatra is a wonderful singer, as expected, and does a good job of acting as Nathan Detroit. Jean Simmons is also very good as Sarah Brown and her scenes with Brando sizzle with great chemistry. All supporting actors do their part, especially Sheldon Leonard as Harry the Horse in a very funny bit. Still, Mankiewicz should be given most of the credit for bringing a fine musical in its own right to the screen in such a way that it feels authentic in many scenes but is still a story in its own world. All in all, Guys and Dolls is a great musical and works on many levels it normally should not have.
