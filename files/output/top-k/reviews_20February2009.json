[{"date":"20 February 2009","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" American Movie starts off with a shot of its principle subject, Mark Borchardt, driving on I94, northbound I think. Right away it brings me home and in some respects I'll have a hard time treating this film objectively. Mark and his family and friends hail from southeastern Wisconsin, the Milwaukee suburbs, as does much of my family, and I grew up with and have known people like them all of my life. So excuse me if my review is a little more subjective and biased than usual.Mark B is a very tall, 30ish working-class guy from Menomenee Falls WI (I think; that's the suburb most referred-to) a town on the outer ring of Milwaukee suburbs. Mark has been trying for years to raise money - and talent - for a full-length low budget horror film production called Northwestern but as the film opens in 1995 he's having a hard time getting it together. Part of the problem is that nobody else seems to share Mark's passion - he has a habit of talking in technical film jargon to people who have no comprehension of it, or for that matter of a lot of simpler concepts. Not having money or any kind of film education, Mark is surrounded by amateurs who are mostly family and friends, notably total burnout Mike Schank (who provided the beautiful, low-key acoustic guitar music for the film) and his uncle Bill, who is physically weak, terminally depressed, and possibly senile. Much of Mark's time is spent trying to cadge money out of Uncle Bill, who doesn't understand or care about Mark's project. Early on he realizes that the feature project just isn't going to happen soon, so he decides to finish off a short film he has been sitting on, Coven, and to put his hopes on video sales of this work getting him enough money to get going on Northwestern. Most of the rest of the film alternates between Mark filming, editing, and post-dubbing Coven, with many scenes being both funny and rather sad or pathetic - like his attempts to have his uncle Joe, the executive producer recite a very simple line - and his generally despondent personal life, including jobs as a paper deliveryman and a groundskeeper\/janitor at a cemetery, the same cemetery (I think) that provides him with fond memories of childhood escapes from his ever-fighting parents. It's not a life of quiet desperation, but rather one of loud, profane and sometimes almost spastic desperation.For me this was, as I said, familiar territory; I have a cousin very much like Mark in many respects and I've been around would-be low-budget horror filmmakers quite a bit. The feel of the hopeless rut that Mark feels he's in, both physically (suburban Milwaukee ain't exactly exciting) and mentally (he drinks way too much and has problems with his ex-girlfriend and seeing his 3 kids) are really conveyed well, and yet there's an overriding optimism that always seems to carry him through. A lot of people have commented on his obnoxious, overbearing attitude, and it certainly isn't something that appeals to me - I'd probably hate the guy if I knew him in real life, at least if he kept making condescending statements to me about life and dreams like he does to his family - but somehow it's endearing when you're not right there and you're just seeing how he - somehow - manages to get his project through to completion, over two more years. Much of it is really funny - I couldn't help but find his buddy Mike funny despite his completely wasted, burnt-out life, and Mike too is good-natured about things. It's in a lot of ways a very hopeful and invigorating film about taking chances, and as somebody much like Mark (only older, even) who has frittered away a lot of my life, I can only take heart.One odd element to the whole thing that I haven't seen anybody mention is the interplay between the filmmakers of American Movie - themselves working on a very low budget and scrabbling around a bit - and Mark and his family and crew. It's an odd choice that there's never really any back-and-forth between them about the nature of the film-about-the-film, we don't know for example where Chris Smith and his crew are staying while they do this, how they're managing with their budget, etc. Not really a fault, but an interesting artistic choice to leave all of that out. What does Mark think about his life being filmed, for that matter? We don't get much of that either.The fine DVD that I just watched offers a couple dozen deleted scenes, none essential but most worth seeing, two separate commentaries, and Borchardt's completed Coven which I'll review separately. Highly recommended - especially if you're a filmmaker, or a Wisconsinite. Or both.

Just what has America come to? When your children can be so easily manipulated by stereotypes from others, and the media, and then turn that manipulation into a full blown belief, you just know that something is wrong.Edward Norton delivers a phenomenal role as Derek Vinyard, a young Venice Beach resident who transforms into a heartless and ruthless skinhead after his racist father is killed by a black man while trying to put out a fire in South Central Los Angeles.Edward Norton, while not regularly taking a villainous role, truly comes across as an nonnegotiable force of prejudiced evil in this film, even adorned with a memorable and gigantic swastika tattoo on his chest. Joining the misled youth during his tirade of hatred is the long lost Stacy Keach from M.A.S.H. as his white supremacist mentor, Cameron Alexander, who could very well become Venice Beach's own version of Adolf Hitler, a sly and evil man who uses his words and connections to reach out to frustrated youths, and rally them to his pure Nazi-esquire campaign.Also joining the pure white army is My Name Is Earls very own Ethan Supplee as the massive and short-tempered skinhead Seth, who can't help but gnaw away at all the viewers nerves, as he takes his hatred on other white people, rather than ONLY non-whites.Terminator 2's Edward Furlong also delivers a powerful role as Derek's impressionable younger brother Danny, who is well on his way to becoming just like his brother.This film is highly praised in my eyes, as it displays just how destructive racism is, not only to strangers, but also to those closest to you. A truly horrific scene, that will no doubt last forever, is when a furious Edward Norton drags a wounded black gangster to the concrete curb in front of his house, and mercilessly curb stomps his skull to the ground, and then grinning innocently as he is taken away by the police, as if he has done nothing wrong.Only until it is too late, and he is in prison, does Derek slowly realize the mistakes he has made in his life, especially after he is viciously raped in the showers by the local Aryan Brotherhood, and brought to his senses by his black former teacher.Upon returning to the real world, Derek tries his best to try and bring the old Danny back to his family, as the new skinhead Danny is very quickly going down the same road Derek once went down. Needless to say, his former Nazi friends do NOT take Derek's change of heart well at all.In a climactic, and earth shattering finale, Derek finally convinces Danny not to follow in his brother's footsteps, and they both decide to begin a hate-free life, but only to have Danny mercilessly gunned down in his school bathroom by a young black kid.Truly, hatred only begets hatred, and that lesson is very vividly shown in this masterpiece. American History X is a film that is to be seen by everyone at least once. If you have a family member, or friend, who is slowly succumbing, or showing signs of prejudice or hatred towards non white people, and beginning to take Nazi-like beliefs to heart, show them this film ASAP, so they'll know not to make those mistakes.American History X is truly a classic, and is to be respected as such.

Most notably this includes the father (Kevin Spacey) developing an obvious infatuation with his teenage daughter's attractive friend (Mena Suvari).The film's tagline, Look closer, signals that this is a film that will be appreciated most by those who do just that. That being said, the film's storyline is compelling even if you don't pay much attention to the film's underlying philosophy of 'beauty'. In any case, I feel that the script's Oscar win was warranted though I'm sure that the subject matter won't appeal to everyone.The film features a well-assembled ensemble cast. Kevin Spacey won an Oscar for his role and, while I prefer other roles of his to this one, I do think that he was a deserving winner. Annette Bening was also quite good but she was beaten for Oscar by Hilary Swank's powerful performance in Boys Don't Cry. I'm surprised that Chris Cooper didn't seem to garner much notice for his strong supporting role, which I prefer to his later Oscar-winning role in Adaptation. The younger actors (Thora Birch, Wes Bentley & Mena Suvari) hold their own though it isn't especially surprising to see that they haven't done much of note since.The Oscar-winning direction by Sam Mendes is quite impressive coming from a first time director and the visuals are further bolstered by the Oscar-winning cinematography of Conrad Hall. Also noteworthy is the Oscar-nominated score by Thomas Newman which is supplemented by some well-chosen soundtrack selections.The five Oscars and three additional nominations show that this film was a well-rounded effort. It is also one of the few Best Picture Oscar winners of recent years that few will dispute. Personally, I think that it is a fine film though I don't rank it quite as highly as the rest of IMDb's voters (ie. currently ranked #37 in the top 250).

When i first rented it back in 98, i had to rent it again at least 4 more times. Then i bought it on VHS, and most recently, on DVD. This movie was a part of my childhood and is still a part of me to this day. Every character in this movie is bright, wonderful, and a joy to watch. now i know i said i wouldn't gush. oh well. The movie is about a cat named danny who wants to be a Hollywood actor. So when he arrives in Hollywood he is shocked to find that it treats animals not quite as he thought, causing them to live in despair. along the way he meets sawyer, a white cat who had given up on her desire, a little penguin named pudge, a hippo named tillie, a MGM lion parody named woolly the mammoth, a turtle voiced by don knotts, and a tango duo of a goat and a fish. his main obstacle is a shirley temple joke named Darla Dimple with her HUGE servant named max. She tries everything in her power to stop him from becoming a star. now i would tell you what happens, but this movie is too good to be spoiled. This is the way movies should be.

When i first rented it back in 98, i had to rent it again at least 4 more times. Then i bought it on VHS, and most recently, on DVD. This movie was a part of my childhood and is still a part of me to this day. Every character in this movie is bright, wonderful, and a joy to watch. now i know i said i wouldn't gush. oh well. The movie is about a cat named danny who wants to be a Hollywood actor. So when he arrives in Hollywood he is shocked to find that it treats animals not quite as he thought, causing them to live in despair. along the way he meets sawyer, a white cat who had given up on her desire, a little penguin named pudge, a hippo named tillie, a MGM lion parody named woolly the mammoth, a turtle voiced by don knotts, and a tango duo of a goat and a fish. his main obstacle is a shirley temple joke named Darla Dimple with her HUGE servant named max. She tries everything in her power to stop him from becoming a star. now i would tell you what happens, but this movie is too good to be spoiled. This is the way movies should be. The characters are all incredibly enjoyable (even the villain), the songs are so memorable i've been singing them for 11 years (especially the intro song, danny's arrival song, and nothing's gonna stop us now), the animation is beautiful, flowing and very pleasing to the eye, and the theme, while being a bit overused is still great and warming to the heart. that if you try hard enough, you can do anything. More movies need to be this level of quality. a movie that is so good it makes you look past the tiny flaws. This movie will always have a special place in my heart, but this isn't just through the rose colored glasses of my youth, i just saw this movie again this evening and i still feel the warmth and joy i did when i first saw it. the same can't be said about some of my other movies (magic voyage. that's right. you stink).

Racism is probably one of the most bitter roots of this hate.American History X shows us the story of Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton), who is one of the most provoking individuals of hatred as a Neo Nazi. His hatred started when his father Dennis (William Russ) was murdered by African Americans. His hate heavily affects his mother Doris (Beverly D'Angelo) and younger sister Davina (Jennifer Lien). He is even hateful toward his mom's new Jewish lover, Murray (Elliott Gould).However, we also see Derek's transformation to the other side, who are disgusted with all of this hate. His younger brother, Danny (Edward Furlong) takes after his brother's hateful ways a little too well and falls in with the Neo Nazi crowd with Derek's old buddy Seth (Ethan Suplee) and his ex girlfriend Stacey (Fairuza Balk). Derek challenges the group led by Cameron Alexander (Stacy Keach) and their hateful ways. However, Danny soon is told how bad his ways are when confronted by his principal, Bob Sweeney (Avery Brooks) and asked to attend his personal history class, American History X.The movie has a lot of bitter moments and is hard to watch at times, but it thoroughly gets the message across about hatred and racism.9\/10.

An outstanding cast featuring American and British heavyweights, the best prosthetic make up ever achieved, a gripping, engaging plot, an unbelievably clever script, beautiful sets and set-pieces, and perhaps the greatest twist ending of all time? Those are just a few things that come to mind when I think of this film. This film is first and foremost, a thinking person's movie. Ironically, it was a huge hit with kids because of the fantasy\/action aspect of the film. Make no mistake though, this an adult film dealing with serious, philosophical and political issues which are still relevant today. This movie challenges the viewer's perception of reality and man's place in the universe in a way that no other film ever has. Charlton Heston gives by far the most under-appreciated performance of his career, giving us a vital, living, breathing, bleeding character who is impossible not to sympathize with. As Heston wanders further into this brave new world I found myself wishing I was him, despite the horrors he encounters. The viewer feels every ounce of pain that Taylor, played by Heston, feels. It is a cathartic cinematic experience that is not to be missed. Franklin Shaffner, the director, deserves to be counted among the all-time greats for this movie alone, but throw in Patton, which he also directed, and it is clear he was a singular talent. I could honestly go on forever about how thoroughly engrossing this movie is, but I won't here. Just know that this movie represents the best that Hollywood has to offer-intelligent script, superb acting, thrilling action, masterful editing, an unforgettable score and great plot twists. Planet of the Apes is in my top 3 all time films and still holds up incredibly well almost forty years later.

We see Valerie as a misunderstood - but strong-willed - person disenchanted with the world around her. Lili Taylor does a really good job showing what sort of person Solanas was. The movie doesn't try to deify Solanas in any way, it shows what kind of world she came from, and that she tried to make a new life for herself. Above all, one gets a sense of how weird (and mildly depraved) it must have been in Andy Warhol's world. I recommend the film.Also starring Jared Harris.

This is the kind of flick I enjoy watching during a hang over because it defines perfectly the action movie clichés. What am I talking about? Well, it delivers an easy to follow plot where the good guy has to fight against the villains, where there is sentimentalism (that dirty rabbit doll is a low punch for those who easily get sentimental or cry), badass villains, very good f\/x, cheesy one-liners (Cy...onara please?) a decent score, and of course, the typical plot where everything has to de destroyed. Nicholas Cage is fine this time although the movie didn't recquire a demanding acting level. John Malkovich steals the show as always in this badass performance. Monica Potter is super sexy and cute at the same time; how does it works? Easy! she's super sexy. So grab a bag of popcorn and enjoy! This movie won't make you think.
