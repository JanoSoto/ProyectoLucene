I didn't like ALL his movies (didn't care for either of the Mission Impossible flicks), but he is a real cool actor, and that was made evident ever since his breakthrough role in Risky Business.  Cruise turns in yet another terrific performance. It's a shame, being he is one of the handsomemest men in the universe, that they had to fracture his face throughout most of the film, but I also have to admire him for allowing viewers (especially females) to see him disfigured, proving (like in Born on the 4th of July) that he is not just a glamour guy, just a pretty face, that he is up to taking risks in the roles he chooses.If you've seen the previews, you've seen the first thirty minutes.  And for that, I'm glad!  Because so many previews nowadays practically give away the film.  Anyone who has seen the previews for Cast Away knows that's true. Though it was a great movie, we sat there for three hours knowing that Tom Hanks would finally survive and return to civilization in one piece.  I won't give away what happens after Cruise gets into the car accident with Cameron Diaz, because the outcome is utterly unpredictable.  Cameron Crowe surprises you with plot twist after plot twist, making you think more and more.  After leaving the theater, I had a totally different view of life. All sorts of questions came into mind.  All those magical what if questions.  What if things aren't what they seem?  Though the outcome is pure fantasy--created with great imagination--it still makes you ponder what lies in the future.  Maybe this COULD happen.Jason Lee is a scene-stealer, as Cruise's best friend.  I am a great admirer of Jason, but after cringing at his disastrous role in Heartbreakers I was hoping he could stay in the independent circuit, and not even dream of co-starring in another big-budget motion picture.  But in this movie he plays the role he was born to play--what he's truly good at.  Playing the wise-cracking, intellectual, smart-aleck, know-it-all best friend.  The kind of role that put him on the map in such films as Mallrats and Chasing Amy.  He is hilarious and brings great comic relief to this moderately depressing story.  So I hope to see him in more movies, small- or big-budget--just be careful how they cast you, Jason.As for Penelope Cruz--I have to admit, I'm tired of seeing her on screen. I used to think she was attractive, but now I think she looks like a bird. But that's not my main reason for disliking her in this film.  In fact, I didn't mind her (small) role in Blow.  I guess it's because her role was only semi-serious, playing a sex-obsessed cokehead.  In Vanilla Sky she plays a serious role that seems to have been written for an American, or someone with good control of the English language.  Here, she's struggling through her lines left and right, and the dialogue just doesn't sound convincing coming from her mouth.  Therefore, it's hard for her to convey any true emotion.  I've never seen any of her Spanish films, but she might've acted well in them, being she has great control of her native language.  So I'm not just being cruel.  I'm sorry, but I just find her accent to be annoying and distracting.At two hours and thirty minutes, the movie is too long for its own good and it does drag at times--a few scenes really didn't seem necessary and could've easily ended up on the cutting room floor.  But I guess Cameron Crowe is one of those directors who prefers to stretch out the running time, making sure not a single element is left out.  Jerry Maguire (also directed by Crowe) was also too long for its own good.  However, I'm still recommending this film because of the mere fact that it's like nothing you've ever seen.

I thought it was going to be excellent, since I've liked all John Malcovich's movies other than this one. He was completely outstanding in The portrait of a lady and Dangerous liaisons, but this is certainly disappointing. I never thought I'd regret to have rented this. Anyway I think it was completely unrealistic; however it's truly original. Despite everything I really enjoyed the movie a little. The plot was originally made, because I think many people wish they could have been someone else. It makes me think a lot as to who I'd like to be. We are all supposed to be like we are. This movie taught me I mustn't wish to be another person, since God created everybody as equal, we all must thank God for all the things He's ever given us. This is a good life lesson. But I don't think the movie's purpose was to teach about it, since it just minded about sex, greediness, and stuff like that. John Malcovich plays himself very well as well as John Cusak and Cameron Díaz, which I didn't recognize at all, I just found out about it. Her hairstyles and dresses were not flashy at all. Her character was quite bothersome and sick; however Catherine Keen played the part better, since she was very well cast to star as Maxine, but I couldn't believe she got an academy award nomination for best actress in a supporting role. I don't think she was that great to get it.All in all, this is an original movie. I really never thought a movie could have this sort of plot, which makes it rather interesting.

A lot of reviewers applauded the film during its theatrical run, mainly on the guise that this movie was truly terrifying and that it was a welcome entry into the genre that most film-makers these days simply have no idea about. On that premise alone, I thought this movie would be something different... that it would have things that movies like I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, URBAN LEGEND, SCREAM and yes, even WISHMASTER, didn't have. Strangely enough, I could not find a scrap of difference that JEEPERS CREEPERS had to offer that would supposedly make it different from the hundreds of other horror films out there that get released 'straight-to-video'.The problem with this film is that the two lead characters, brother and sister (played by Gina Phillips and Justin Long) are so darn annoying that you will find yourself rooting for the 'monster' half the time because their endless squabbling and inexcusable stupidity starts to dig into your nerves.The two are on a road trip returning home from College to see their mother in an unknown State. The landscape consists of mostly farmland and cornfields and it won't be two minutes into the film until you're already thinking of CHILDREN OF THE CORN and TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE. Of course this spells trouble for the two as they become victims of a mysterious 'road rager' who rams their car from behind in some sort of 'Munsters'-like contraption that is pieced together by rusted metal and juiced up with some cool acceleration fluid that allows the said vehicle to speed around them at an unexplainable speed.Fortunately at this point, the terrorizing vehicle is about the ONLY thing in this movie that seems 'creepy'. Further trouble is spelled out for the siblings as they pass an old boarded-up church and recognize the same vehicle that rammed their car earlier, parked out the front. A man clad in a leather slicker (yep, start thinking I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER) is dumping a body wrapped in a white sheet down a corrugated-iron pipe and before you know it, the two meddling siblings are playing detective and investigating the situation after the stranger drives off in his vehicle.Naturally, in a film like JEEPERS CREEPERS, you can't for a second take anything that happens in this movie seriously. So when the brother ends up inside the tunnel to discover a horrific finding that involves a corpse with his bodily organs recently extracted and countless petrified bodies glued to the walls and ceiling in some sort of underground cavern, it will only be a natural reaction that you will find yourself shaking your head in disgust at how cliche'd this is turning out to be.With the siblings now on the run to report this monstrosity to the local 'hick' authorities, they have the 'monster' closely on their pursuit and naturally put everyone else in danger who they happen to come into contact with. That would also include Eileen Brennan who makes an inexcusable cameo in this movie as a half-crazy shotgun-wielding cat lover who makes the most of her four minutes on screen battling the 'monster' inside her house before suffering a very nasty demise.Another major problem with JEEPERS CREEPERS is that the 'monster' featured in this movie is not exactly scary or creepy. He looks like a regular character that could be featured on an episode of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER and the things he does aren't exactly 'horrific'. The body count is very low for a horror movie. Most horror buffs won't find much pleasure here seeking out a high gore count as most of the killings usually involve a quick death by way of organ extraction or decapitation.Understanding that this movie was made on a relatively small budget, you can excuse the bad make-up effects where the corpses resemble department store mannequins. The monster itself has very weak motives. His reasons for killing are not explained very well. A psychic advises the sister that he kills his victims and removes a certain body part so it will become a part of him in its place (think of THE MUMMY and the bodies it consumed to make it a 'whole' being). The bad news for the siblings is that it is after one of them in particular because he or she has something that it wants (most likely a body part or two).Some ridiculous scenes would include a police station and the obligatory 'bumbling' cops who, even in a pack of 10, could not manage to hold a monster at bay with their whole firearms arsenal. With that being said, the ending is about the only satisfying thing that I felt that I got out of this movie. What happens, I cannot say. But let's just say that the 'monster' got what he wanted.The only bad thing about the ending is that it leaves the door open for an eventual and probable sequel that no one was really asking for.

But I did see it later, on video, and it still scares the bejeezus out of me today. What made that film work was that it was low budget (and therefore more realistic) and that the gore was so... well, so disgusting, for 1974. But the best part of the movie was that it was a popcorn movie - the kind where you'd warn the people in the movie not to go downstairs, and so on. It's pure escapism. Jeepers Creepers fits into this mold. It's an escape movie. You don't watch it to learn things; you watch it for plain old mind-numbing entertainment. The movie is about two siblings driving along a long, quiet country road on their way home from college. A madman in a big, souped-up, customized truck tailgates them, then runs them off the road. Later, they see him dumping something down a huge pipe. And sure, they stop to investigate. I mean, wouldn't you? As in many escapism movies, the characters consistently do profoundly stupid things, like climb down the pipe, don't go for help, don't get the heck out there like right now, and so on. It's the old Scooby Doo mentality; let's solve this puzzle, huh gang?For much of the movie, I laughed heartily. But hey! you say. It's not a comedy, is it? Right on, it's not a comedy. It's a horror film. And I wasn't laughing at stuff that was supposed to be funny. I was laughing at stuff that was supposed to be scary.

Effects aren't bad, acting is, kind of forgettable.But then the final 20 minutes or so came. And man, let me tell you - this is some serious fear. The final few scenes are better than anything else in the movie put together. There's dramatic tension AND good effects. That hardly ever happens in modern horror films. And the final shot?

Also, there is the scene in the Hummer, where he gets shot in the neck, and is still able to steer the Hummer with one hand, and hold the wound in his neck with the other.One other beef that I had with this movie is the characters. Alot of the time was spent on the war scenes, and there was no character introduction. Therefore, you really can not connect with the charcters in the film.

I did enjoy her in THE OTHERS, but I have to say that her performance in this film would be about on par as that in BMX BANDITS or BUSH CHRISTMAS. I thought the musical pieces in MOULIN ROUGE were 'ear-bleedingly' awful, especially the sequence where both Ewan and Nicole are serenading each other with snippets of songs such as I Was Made For Loving You and Silly Love Songs. There is one truly awful moment in the film that involves a man screeching out an unforgivable horrendous rendition of The Police's Roxanne.It was about the scene where John Leguizamo and his side-kicks gate-crash Ewan McGregor's personal home-warming to have him join their performing art troupe where Ewan finds himself bellowing out a sonnet of The Hills Are Alive from THE SOUND OF MUSIC that I found myself losing patience for this movie. My nerves and patience at that point were already at razor's edge. A special appearance by Kylie Minogue as 'The Green Fairy' in a 'Tinkerbell'-type role was the final straw for me.I shifted myself to the next room to work on the computer and for the next two hours, all I heard was non-stop 'yahooing' and music that resembled the sound a tin bucket would make after it was kicked down an endless flight of stairs.

There is one truly awful moment in the film that involves a man screeching out an unforgivable horrendous rendition of The Police's Roxanne.It was about the scene where John Leguizamo and his side-kicks gate-crash Ewan McGregor's personal home-warming to have him join their performing art troupe where Ewan finds himself bellowing out a sonnet of The Hills Are Alive from THE SOUND OF MUSIC that I found myself losing patience for this movie. My nerves and patience at that point were already at razor's edge. A special appearance by Kylie Minogue as 'The Green Fairy' in a 'Tinkerbell'-type role was the final straw for me.I shifted myself to the next room to work on the computer and for the next two hours, all I heard was non-stop 'yahooing' and music that resembled the sound a tin bucket would make after it was kicked down an endless flight of stairs. Towards the end, I was wondering aloud, Please! Make the hurting stop! The two other people I live with had already secretly exited the living room behind my back to escape the noise.I know that Nicole Kidman's main professional talent is targeted mainly towards acting. It is not a fair suggestion on my behalf to opine that she should work harder on the acting and leave the 'singing' thing alone altogether.I was very disappointed with this movie. For all the fabulous write-up it has been receiving from famous reviewers and everyday people like you and I, I was expecting a great deal more from MOULIN ROUGE. I really REALLY wanted to like MOULIN ROUGE, but I just couldn't get into it. Please don't accuse me of having a narrow mind because I am a very open-minded person when it comes to film projects. I am sure that Baz Luhrmann had a well-planned artistic dream when he put this film together. Unfortunately for me, it turned out to be one long nightmare. One reviewer on this web-site mentioned that they are in love with Moulin Rouge. I guess my motto would be, I hate Moulin Rouge.My Rating 1 out of 10 ","genre":"Drama, Musical, Romance"},{"date":"16 January 2002","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  J.R.R. Tolkeins books were the first fantasy books I read as a young teenager. At that time, it was a slog to get through the books, and it put me off fantasy for about 5 years. However, I wasn't going to deny myself the film version 20 years later, and this film is a masterpiece!Throughout the entire film, I didn't want it to end, even when I was begining to fidget (thank goodness for stadium seating being the norm nowadays!). When it did end, the film still haunted my mind and thoughts a week later, so I went and saw it again - a first for 3 hour films and me! Although the special effects seemed to leach the colour from our star actors from the moment their quest began (the only thing that irritated me...), the story is a powerful one and I found it impossible to not be sucked into the whole story. The actors were marvelous, but Ian McKellen as Gandalf deserves to be singled out for praise - his best performance yet! I was also glad that Elijah Wood got the role of Frodo - he is very good in it.Nowadays it is rare that Hollywood produces a movie with a real story instead of some marketing approved concept - but thank goodness approval was given for this attempt for Peter Jackson to go ahead with his version. I would suspect this will not be surpassed until 3-D\/interactive movies are made in the future...An absolute must see for its sheer ability to sweep you into the story. How, I ask you, can we wait for the two sequel films?! ","genre":null},{"date":"16 January 2002","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  J.R.R.
