What I mean by two sides, is that I have watched this movie when I did not know English, and also when I was finally able to understand it fully .On both occasions, especially when I watched the film without understanding its language, I have cried during the final scene when William Wallace was being killed. The movie is intense, it has a very straight forward plot with a fairy tale-ish feeling. Although there are no new and innovative personalities, the cast is solid with very convincing characters.Yes, the movie is not exactly what you call historically accurate. However, this isn't a movie dedicated for the history channel guys! Its a Hollywood film that stirs up emotions and lead you out of your reality.I wouldn't say I have a photographic memory or anything remotely close to the IQ of a genius, but what I can say is that, once I watch a movie; I will remember exactly what scenes follow what. This means, a lot of the modern attempts at a creative twist in the plot or a surprise in the story can only interest me once. This is not the case for brave heart. I can say that it is the only movie I can watch weekly or even daily without being frustrated or being bored to death. Even knowing the main character is going to die, I still am able to watch it.My sorry attempt to explain this wonderful movie must have been a nuisance. So please let me apologize beforehand. But as one my favorite movies of all time, and my very first comment on IMDb. I just had to choose Braveheart.

Plenty of time to pad the film with cocktail parties, frolicking on the beach, and racing those fast cars (uh, didn't they mention a fuel shortage?). People will continue to live their normal happy lives. Oh some social malcontent might mention an unpleasant topic like r-a-d-i-a-t-i-o-n but when you have 400 bottles of Port to drink, the only thing to argue about is how you're going to drink that much in five months. Turn that frown upside down, go find yourself the thickest steak in town and wash it down with a Martini just like you always did. You'll have plenty of time to head up to the mountains for a few days, do some fishing and sing drinking songs which will be the perfect soundtrack for a whirlwind romantic adventure and avoid what the movie is supposed to be about.If you're a fan of late 50's acting you'll probably enjoy this first hour. If you're expecting to see a chilling movie about how real people would face the ultimate demise of life on Earth, try another title. There's only one relevant subplot in the first hour and while it tries to get serious approaching the second hour, the romantic melodrama could have been pulled out of any random war movie where the soldier is about to head to the front.

Michael even helped dear old Pansy Milbank (Jean Stapleton) - that last scene is beautiful when they dance on the street.Travolta had great help in other actors.

It looks fantastic but there just is not a real core of human feeling, at least nothing that I personally could connect to. Partly that's because the first half of the film seems to have a very confused narrative focus. It's partly the film about a bitter Marine (Nicholas Cage) who gets injured and has to take a relatively peaceful assignment with a group of Native Americans who are enlisted by the Marines so that their language can be used as a basis for an unbreakable code. For no particularly compelling reason the story focuses on Ben Yahzee (Adam Beach) and a friend he brings along to the war.Beach put in a decent performance but doesn't have much to work with. There's a lot of talk about past racial history and the irony of the fact that the Indians are now fighting with the Americans. One character even speculates about how we might be sitting here 50 years from now with the Japanese trying to figure out how to kick somebody else's butt (or words to that effect). Stuff like this is really annoying to me because it's not the kind of thing that anyone would be talking about in that situation; it's obviously just some junk they thought would seem ironic to people nowadays. So much of the dialog in this movie is forced and awkward like that. The movie is crushed beneath the weight of its pretenses. After the end of the film there's a beautiful shot of Cage in a close-up with a weary expression on his face. I saw that and I said oh, there's the performance! Why don't I remember him showing his character like that in the actual movie? And it's because the movie doesn't even dare to stop long enough or to slow down so that you can appreciate anything that's happening. From the very first scenes it's just action action action, and I really felt a bit sick especially as the film went on because it seemed to me to blur the lines between action and violence. Kind of like Rambo II and about equally worthless, although at least that film didn't burden itself with hokey reflections of racial politics &#150; and perhaps more significantly it didn't take place during a real conflict. My girlfriend (who has a brother in Iraq) was so offended by the tone and style of the movie that we got in an argument just because I wanted to finish it. I think if you just wanted to see this as an action movie and ignore all the other elements it could be an OK action movie. But since this movie pretends and\/or attempts to be much more and fails so horribly I would not recommend it to anyone. It didn't make me feel anything dramatic until maybe the very end because it never felt like anything more than a video game shoot-em-up.

Many people seem to think that this is a spoof of Star Wars, but really it's more a spoof of the whole science-fiction genre. Not least that low-budget crap i used to watch on TV on Sunday's, movies that i can't remember the title of and that you're not likely to see on collector's DVD any time soon.So, how does this hold up now that i've watched it again after all this time? Well, better than i thought, that's for sure. I was afraid that this movie would be one of those i loved before but couldn't understand at all any more. But while i didn't exactly love it this time around, i still understand why i loved it back then. And there are still a few really good laughs here. Not least when it comes to Rick Moranis Darth Vader-spoof Dark Helmet.

First of all the fact that he always mixes really funny stuff with horribly dated and boring scenes. Second of all i'm no fan of Brooks acting. Many times his characters are among the least funny in the movie, and sometimes when he gives himself a lot of room, that can be a problem.In general though this movie is generally quite funny. It's far from one of Brooks greatest (Blazing Saddles is my favorite and it's light years better, if you'll excuse the pun), but it still holds it's own and is superior to many of his later movies.

I was never really into Star Trek except very mildly until I saw this film but after seeing it I started watching the show on TV as well as revisiting the other films in the series. I still think this one holds up the best of all upon watching it on DVD today, because it combines the humorous character appeal of the fourth film with the more serious action\/vengeance theme of the second film. Christopher Plummer's Chang is an excellent Klingon opponent for Captain Kirk (William Shatner), almost as compelling as Montalban's Khan from the second film. This one also gives many opportunities for our favorite crew members to do humorous and exciting things, the best of which is undoubtedly George Takei's Sulu finally being given command of his own ship and at one point rescuing the Enterprise! And like the fourth film and most episodes of the original show this one has a strong message; it improves somewhat on The Voyage Home by presenting that message through allegory. Not that it's at all subtle that we're supposed to see the Klingons as analogous to the Soviets; I think that's what they were all along and it's beautiful that this film was being made during Glasnost because it allowed Star Trek to wrap up its longest running story in the final film in a way that actually had relevance to real world events of the time. And it also joins the film series up very neatly with Next Generation, which had already showed us a Klingon living at peace with the Federation for several seasons but never explained how the reconciliation occurred. As a I remember the early sequence with the assassination of Chancellor Gorkin (David Warner, who worked with director Meyer on Time After Time) was really impressive at the time of its release, really state-of-the-art FX. I was hooked right away from that scene. I think it's got a great pace. I like the way Spock (Land the others on the ship find ways to sabotage their mission so they can remain and help Kirk and McCoy escape from the Klingon prison. The scene where Kirk is kissed by the alien and McCoy asks What is it with you, anyway? is hilarious, a good example of how Meyer has used the self-conscious character-motivated humor from the fourth film to enhance this somewhat more serious story. And I also like Spock's relationship with the new Vulcan on the ship, Valeris (Kim Cattral). But the greatest scenes are the two primary scenes between Spock and Kirk, and I commend the film-makers for pushing their hero into the scary and potentially alienating territory of racial prejudice. Shatner has explored this territory before, in Roger Corman's exceptional The Intruder, and his performance is chilling when he says of the Klingons Let them die! Having a popular and powerful character like Captain Kirk serve as the mouthpiece for this hatred and racism makes the scenario disturbingly real and immediate. As Chang (Plummer) says, in space all warriors are cold; the two old warriors are ill at ease with the process of peace. Chang chides Kirk admit it, don't you prefer it this way? as he prepares to begin a deadly space battle from which only one of them will survive &#150; by extension he might be speaking for the sadistic side of the audience and the desire in all of us to see violence on the screen. Yes, we'd like to see Captain Kirk and his crew keep fighting these space battles forever but it's just not in the cards. It's interesting how the film invites us to draw something of a parallel between the crew's reluctance to accept peace and retire from duty and the audience's own reluctance to let them sail off into that tender night.Looking at it now (as an adult) there are some clearly obvious elements to the mystery (there's really nobody except the guilty party who is a viable suspect&#133;.

It can be considered as being two movies in one whether it is or not. The first half of the movie is your typical Quentin Tarantino gangland movie. Its starts off with the Gecko Brothers Seth (George Clooney) and Richard (QT) who have just fled a grisly bank robbery and end up kidnapping a retired preacher (Harvey Keitel), his daughter (Juliette Lewis) and his adopted son (Ernest Liu). This half is pure Tarantino for a number of reasons. It is filled with long and interesting dialogue, which makes for good conversation; there is a lot of violence and foul-mouth language. Those reasons would probably be the exact same reasons why I think that this movie is spectacular.This half is almost a cliché, prior to the bank robbery the brothers try to hitch a ride to Mexico so that they could live off of the stolen money. However, Quentin steers away from the cliché by adding in a retired preacher who lost his wife. I love Harvey's performance of a father figure and servant of god rather than a gun-totin' hit man. His character is almost believable. The chemistry between Clooney's Seth and Tarantino's Richard are almost humorous but in the same sense very violent. I think that they work amazingly together. Of course when they get to Mexico the brothers have to stop at a strip club and from there on, it takes a swan dive into hell.The strip club is populated by a sleazy bartender (Danny Trejo), a luscious vixen stripper (Salma Hayek), the raunchy doorman (Cheech Marin), an ex war vet (Fred Williamson) and of coarse the suave Sex Machine (Tom Savini). All of these characters, especially Trejo, Hayek and Marin do a great job in acting out their characters. Even Cheech Marin is scary as hell being a vampire. Tom Savini's Sex Machine is probably one of the funniest characters in a horror movie that I have seen and they all play their parts to perfection. Even the mariachi band does a great job playing there part when it comes time for their transformation.I'll go further to say that vampire strippers are the best concept for this sort of genre. We shouldn't be surprised that QT thought this on up. There is also the cheese factor. There is a lot of corny scenes and cheesy one-liners as well as cheesy fight scenes such as a spaghetti western-style fight scene between the survivors and the vampire strippers. Another great cheesy scenes is filling squirt guns with holy water and making condom balloons with holy water. If you are not scared by now then you'll surly be laughing by now since this movie is so ridiculously well made by Quentin and Robert Rodriguez. Of course the cheese factor does sort of steer away from the story and the unnoticeable plot but I still enjoyed myself.The set was great. Half of the movie takes place on the road and the other half takes place in a strip club that looks like a ancient pyramid decorated with Christmas lights, frill, vodka bottles and naked women. The front of the club looks like skid row gone horribly wrong, with motorcyclists and a huge tire fire, with skinned cow skulls and empty beer bottles lying all over the place.In a hasty conclusion this movie was fun to watch, very fun to watch and although it has it's cheesy moments it's still a great vampire flick by two great writers and directors that should not be missed. I would highly recommend this film to any horror and gore nut out there. I certainly liked and I hope you do to.

Those reasons would probably be the exact same reasons why I think that this movie is spectacular.This half is almost a cliché, prior to the bank robbery the brothers try to hitch a ride to Mexico so that they could live off of the stolen money. However, Quentin steers away from the cliché by adding in a retired preacher who lost his wife. I love Harvey's performance of a father figure and servant of god rather than a gun-totin' hit man. His character is almost believable. The chemistry between Clooney's Seth and Tarantino's Richard are almost humorous but in the same sense very violent. I think that they work amazingly together. Of course when they get to Mexico the brothers have to stop at a strip club and from there on, it takes a swan dive into hell.The strip club is populated by a sleazy bartender (Danny Trejo), a luscious vixen stripper (Salma Hayek), the raunchy doorman (Cheech Marin), an ex war vet (Fred Williamson) and of coarse the suave Sex Machine (Tom Savini). All of these characters, especially Trejo, Hayek and Marin do a great job in acting out their characters. Even Cheech Marin is scary as hell being a vampire. Tom Savini's Sex Machine is probably one of the funniest characters in a horror movie that I have seen and they all play their parts to perfection. Even the mariachi band does a great job playing there part when it comes time for their transformation.I'll go further to say that vampire strippers are the best concept for this sort of genre. We shouldn't be surprised that QT thought this on up. There is also the cheese factor. There is a lot of corny scenes and cheesy one-liners as well as cheesy fight scenes such as a spaghetti western-style fight scene between the survivors and the vampire strippers. Another great cheesy scenes is filling squirt guns with holy water and making condom balloons with holy water. If you are not scared by now then you'll surly be laughing by now since this movie is so ridiculously well made by Quentin and Robert Rodriguez. Of course the cheese factor does sort of steer away from the story and the unnoticeable plot but I still enjoyed myself.The set was great. Half of the movie takes place on the road and the other half takes place in a strip club that looks like a ancient pyramid decorated with Christmas lights, frill, vodka bottles and naked women. The front of the club looks like skid row gone horribly wrong, with motorcyclists and a huge tire fire, with skinned cow skulls and empty beer bottles lying all over the place.In a hasty conclusion this movie was fun to watch, very fun to watch and although it has it's cheesy moments it's still a great vampire flick by two great writers and directors that should not be missed. I would highly recommend this film to any horror and gore nut out there. I certainly liked and I hope you do to.

The writing is full of that corny but wonderfully appropriate dialog that all noir greats feature. The picture is dim and soft and sometimes too dark to see anything, but I'd have been proud to have gone down in film history with Detour as my one and only directing credit. The Third Man is classified as a Film Noir and it's fantastic, but it was a high budget production with big time stars and an A-List director in Carol Reed. Edgar G. Ulmer isn't as well known, but who cares? He took what little was given him and made the most of it. The Third Man is a great noir but I truly favor low budget noir's like Detour The bigger the budget, the smoother and slicker the production. Yes there's lots of rear projection and lots of scenes filmed in a hotel room, but so what? And what if they did have the budget to actually drive around for real? For me, the fact that the whole film looks like a TV kine scope before kine scopes even existed adds to the atmosphere. And I also love the casting. Ann Savage is perfect as the shrew who's attractive, but who also has that worn, aged, definitely younger than she looks look that her character needs to be believable in the part. Tom Neal is no great actor, but he's perfectly cast in his part as a guy who's aways in the wrong place at the wrong time. And please do read his biography.

The rest of the film follows the pair through the remaining 25 years of their relationship.It doesn't sound like much but my God what a sweet film. I do not believe it is sentimentally so, either- very late in the film Daisy is still thoughtlessly treating Hoke like a lesser being.Q What is this movie ABOUT? A The nature of friendship, and race relations in the mid-20th century South.Film is for perhaps the opening half hour the least pleasant movie I can think of. Tandy character very unpleasant and Freeman character cartoonish. Writing like Variety now.But yes, it is an annoying film to start, and it's startling to think how completely it changes as it goes on, without your really noticing it's changed. It mirrors the relationship it depicts.I thought at first that Daisy's Jewishness was sort of a throw away detail and would not 'have to do' with the film, but I was wrong. Her Jewishness proves indeed to be a key to the character. One of the crucial developments in her friendship with Hoke is when they're both treated like trash by a couple of racist Alabama policemen. Solidarity!This is of course expanded upon when Daisy's synagogue being bombed prompts Hoke to tell her about a lynching he remembers from childhood. We get it, we get it.The film does gradually become more and more overtly about race relations (culminating, I think, with the two friends listening separately, for no good reason separately, to the King speech) yet remains throughout mostly about this friendship.There is that separateness. We wonder why, after so many years, do they eat separately? And our heart aches for them both, and for that time and place.The final scene is perfect. No more separateness.The acting in the film is superb. Morgan Freeman is a fine actor and his performance here reminds me of none of his others I've seen. Jessica Tandy, beautiful at 80, is very good in a very difficult role. She had to play an annoying, mean old woman at the beginning of this picture, and that's thankless, but she did it.

My favorite scenes of hers are during the trip to Alabama, first when she's shamed by the racist policemen, later when she's left in the car alone and, frightened, begins calling for Hoke.

The 1963 version of 'The Haunting' is an eerie haunted house flick from a time when special effects weren't needed to scare audiences. Not that I'm knocking effects, quite the opposite, but if it worked in the original then why change it for the remake? OK so try something different, but I would think the possibilities would be greater than that. Does that make this film awful? Not really, but it's not much more than OK rainy afternoon entertainment.Pros A good cast that gives it's all. Moves at a decent pace. The exterior and interior architecture of the house are simply exquisite. Some good jump scares. This time we're given more back story on the house and owner and it's quite sinister. Some of the computer graphics are really impressive. Another solid score from Jerry Goldsmith.Cons The makers of the film seem more interested in spectacle instead of depth, strong character development, etc., which cripples the suspense. Some of the computer graphics, for example a door that turns into a hand, are very unconvincing. Not even slightly scary.

And with good reason. The original format was deliberately constructed to fit American television's one-hour-minus-commercial-breaks timeslots and could not easily be extended to the two hours of the average cinema feature. In recent years, however, Hollywood's dearth of original concepts for new films has led it to turn to old television shows as a source of new ideas.The Angels of the title are three young women who work for a private detective agency. Every episode of the TV series used to begin with the three sitting on a sofa and being given their instructions by their boss, Charlie. Charlie never appeared in the series and the angels never got to meet him; instead he communicated with them by a speaker (presumably connected to a radio link). The Angels' adventures were all crime-fighting or espionage-related exploits, told in a light-hearted style reminiscent of the Bond films. Although the series showed women as strong and capable, it was sometimes criticised by feminists for concentrating too much on its heroines' physical charms and for an occasionally patronising tone, such as the way in which the voice-over which accompanied the opening credits always referred to the women as three little girls.The film version keeps the same basic idea. The three Angels in this version are called Dylan, Natalie and Alex. One morning Charlie gives them their instructions on their latest case, the kidnapping of a software expert, presumably by a business rival. They quickly manage to trace the kidnapped man and free him, only to find that they have got involved in a scheme to murder Charlie himself.That, at least, is the basic plot. It actually gets a lot more complicated than that, but plot is not something the film takes seriously. Come to that, it's difficult to say exactly what the film does take seriously. It is never sure whether it wants to send up the original series or to celebrate it. At first it looks as though it is being satirical, replacing the original voice-over with a more feminist-friendly one about how the three little girls grew up into women, but any intention of satirising seventies sexism is soon shelved.Shelved, but not replaced with anything tangible. The plot is generally either implausible or incomprehensible. Characterisation is negligible; the three Angels seem to have interchangeable personalities and the villains are all completely colourless. At first I thought that Tim Curry's arrogant, overbearing tycoon would prove to be the exception, but it turns out that he is not the real enemy. The heavily stylised fight and action sequences are unconvincing; if the oddly-named director McG thought he could achieve a similar balletic effect to that found in Chinese martial arts films such as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, he was sadly mistaken. All the film has to fall back upon is the physical charms of its three heroines, and while these are considerable (Lucy Liu looks particularly lovely), glamour alone is never enough to ensure the success of any film (except perhaps softcore porn).The film aims at being light-hearted but ends up as simply lightweight, the sort of brain-dead popcorn blockbuster put together without any real thought. For me two things stand out as symbols of this slapdash approach. The role of Alex was originally written with Angelina Jolie in mind; when Lucy Liu was drafted in at the last minute, the scriptwriters neglected to change the character's Anglo-Saxon surname (Munday) to something more suitably Oriental. An important plot-point hangs upon Natalie's ornithological skills, specifically her ability to identify a Pygmy Nuthatch, but the bird we see is not a nuthatch at all but a member of the oriole family. McG and Drew Barrymore (who acted as producer as well as taking the role of Dylan) should be charged with film-making without due care and attention. 3\/10.
