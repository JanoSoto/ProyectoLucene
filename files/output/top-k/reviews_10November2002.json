In one scene at the beginning of the movie he almost beats a former high school student colleague to death.  At this point I wanted to stop watching the movie. The beating was disgusting.Will solves mathematical problems with the same ease that the average guy solves crossword puzzles but his psychological problems are an obstacle to utilizing his genius. I shall say no more about the plot except that, as expected from a sophomoric project, the ending is predictable and even banal.The movie won a number of awards including the Oscar for Best Screenplay (Ben Affleck and Matt Damon) and the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor (Robin Williams). In my humble opinion, the awards were a reflection of the appreciation by the movie industry that two inexperienced guys, Damon and Affleck, could pull off a full-length feature film and were not a reflection of any inherent quality in the movie.  Robin Williams was much better in Dead Poets Society and in Fischer King but didn't win any oscar for these performances.Further evidence of the immaturity that so typifies this movie is the fact that the supporting cast were all chosen from family and friends  Skylar, Will Hunting's girl friend, is played by Minnie Driver who he was dating at the time.  Furthermore, Hunting's screen-friends are played by Casey Affleck, Ben Affleck's brother, and by a personal friend, Cole Hauser.  Neither of these screen-friends add anything to the movie.The production crew of Will Hunting is professional and the final product is slick.

I had been a little disappointed by some of her recent efforts (Charlie's Angels) in which her real abilities were not used or even touched on. I'd have to say that going into this movie, I was sceptical as to whether or not this would be yet another Angel flop. On a happier note, though, I was pleasantly surprised.

In all honesty, I don't think anyone could have done a better job playing this role and anyone who believes that is fooling themselves.Steve Zahn showed much growth in this movie. Audiences are used to seeing him as a moronic slap-stick comedian. It was nice to see him step-up and try on a role more suiting for adult audiences. Adam Garcia gave a wonderful performance as well. His character, a bit whiney and unrealistic at times, seems to be the under-dog throughout the entire story...saving his mother from herself and each other from mental instability (although that aspect may not have been fully achieved, which is apparent towards the end of the movie).I would have to say though that my favorite actor in this entire movie would in fact have to be James Woods. He is by far the most realistic Hollywood dad I have seen in a long time. I couldn't help but smile and think of my own while watching him.Although the ending was abrupt and could have done with a little more explanation, it suited the story line.

Brittany Murphy's character shows that good friends will stick by you through the good times and the bad, but will also be willing to slap some sense into you when you really screw up.

The age difference would have been more believable had the film been set in 1973, when the story begins, rather than the present. Anyway, the story is about a disgruntled ex-Nazi, Dressler (Alan Bates) who acquires a nuclear device and plans to instigate a war between the USA and Russia and then take over when the super powers destroy each other. The new Russian President, Nemerov (Ciaran Hinds) is set up by Dressler to be blamed for a nuculear attack which wipes out a large part of Baltimore. U.S. President Fowler (James Cromwell) calls in the CIA headed by William Cabot (Morgan Freeman).  Cabot enlists the aide of historian Jack Ryan (Affleck) because Ryan has done a thorough study on Nemerov. Ryan believes the Russian to be innocent even though all around him believe him guilty. As each side prepares to launch their respective missles, Ryan and CIA Operative John Clark (Liev Schrieber) are busily gathering information and Ryan is racing against the clock to convince Fowler of Nemenov's innocence. Affleck tries his best to make us forget Harrison Ford but to no avail. He simply cannot be taken seriously as the man who holds the world's fate in his hands. Freeman is excellent as always and Cromwell and Hinds stand out as the two world leaders. Bates makes a nasty villain and Schrieber is good as the mysterious man with a past, Clark. Bridget Moynahan appears as Affleck's love interest and future wife. The real star of the picture are the special effects.

Clooney, at which point I figured this would be a good time to get to it. (It's strange seeing the remake before the original, as in my case happened with Get Carter.)  So I contacted the always reliable Facets people in Chicago and when TWO videocassettes arrived and I saw it was almost three hours long, I thought Uh-oh.  My previous experience with a Russian epic had been War and Peace.  The Russians seem to feel that translating a novel to film means rendering it word for word and image for image.  At least War and Peace had battles and other things going on.  Solaris has mostly dialogue---lots and lots and lots of dialogue.I haven't read the novel, and I probably won't, so I'll have to take the word of those commentators who say it's great.  I knew roughly what it was about, and the premise sounded a lot like Kubrick's 2001.  As Solaris began, it reminded me of 2001 right off Kubrick always liked to start slowly, and the pace of Solaris was almost glacial.  The footage of Russian fauna and flora went on so long that I guessed the director was trying to convey visually something that had been spelled out in the novel. But a movie's not a novel.  When after about half an hour we actually had some dialogue, it seemed the brooding protagonist was about to go off into space to join with a rogue shuttle.  (Why the government would send just one guy, and a shrink at that, was never particularly clear.)  As his parents gloomily watched him burning his papers, I assumed it must be some kind of suicide mission.The movie stopped dead again during an endless cab ride.  Visually it was impressive with the mobile camera and the alternating light and shadow, but I was viewing it as a nicely filmed sequence, not part of a story.  (The director kept switching between black and white and color, likewise distracting one from the story.)

The premise has been done time and time again, it's basically a fish out of water story. Yes, the gangsters are dumb almost to the point where they're annoying. Sure, we see the message coming from a mile away.But there are a few things that separate this film from other comedies, and elevate to the status of excellence. First of all, it's hilarious. There are few jokes that don't work and they are immediately forgotten as this fast-paced romp wastes no time. The speed-up of scenes and the quick editing (several shots seem to last for no longer than a few seconds) do get a slight bit irritating, but it serves its purpose by catering to the fast-paced story and Sinbad's style of comedy. Take for instance, the party scene in which Sinbad is explaining what the GFH on his suit jacket stands for. Slow down the scene, and it loses the humor.Since the McDonald's issue has been cited again and again in reviews with varying degrees of criticism, let me address it briefly. First of all, there are a lot of people who love to eat McDonald's food. It's not healthy for you, but you'd be lying if you say that it tastes awful. Now, Sinbad's character is established as the lazy, unhealthy, always-eating slacker from the very beginning as he comes home to his apartment and enjoys his McDonald's and 2 liter bottle of soda. The real Derek Bond is completely contrasted with the impostor Derek Bond's lifestyle. Hence the fish out of water comedy. Sinbad's character is put in a desperate situation where he assumes this other man's life and the man he is pretending to be is the complete opposite of him. He's got a successful career as a dentist and he maintains a strict diet of vegetables and muescli cereal. So, when Sinbad's Kevin Franklin character, in this awkward and unfamiliar situation of staying with a suburban family's house and pretending to be someone who everyone expects to be a health-conscious stuffy professional, manages to escape for a moment and sees the familiar golden arches, he's so happy that he feels like he's in a commercial. He knows McDonald's and in many places, McDonald's seems to be an unchanging, constant source of familiar greasy food. McDonald's works in the context of the film because it's a real fast-food place that we can relate to, because we've all eaten there at one time or another. To me, if there was some fictional place like Lou's Hamburgers, it wouldn't work. The character design might come through, but there could be no jingle resounding in our heads, and it'd take you out of the reality of the story (which I discuss in next paragraph). Yes, McDonald's is a real fast-food joint, and Kevin Franklin loves to eat there. Does that make Houseguest a McDonald's commercial? I don't think that it does, I think it maintains an element of reality that we as viewers can relate to. Perhaps we needn't always be so cynical as some professional film critics are.Now, I mention the 'reality' of Houseguest and you must think I'm absolutely crazy. Houseguest is an unrealistic film that requires you to throw logic out the door entirely if you wish to enjoy it, right? Well, not necessarily. I think looking back at this film, eight years after it was made, we can look at the family suburban life depicted, and notice the real-ness of the characters. Phil Hartman's character Gary Young is a hard-working businessman at a law firm. He sucks up to his boss and the boss's wife and spends more time with his job than his family. Gary's wife tries to be there for her family, but she's taken on a career with frozen yogurt stores and it's turning out to be far more time-consuming than she imagined.Then, there are the three children. The oldest girl is distancing herself from her family, trying to find comfort in a Goth phase, taking pleasure from sad poetry and a boyfriend who seems to think that he's a tough kid from the hood. The middle child is the only son, Jason. He tries to win his father's approval by playing basketball and hoping to be good. The youngest daughter seems not to be getting any attention, either. Her busy parents don't have time for her, and she's been getting lessons from television programs instead.The dysfunctional middle-class family serves as a foil for Kevin Franklin, pretending to be someone he is not, who will ultimately find the desire to help these people, who have unknowingly opened up their home to him, a complete stranger. Kevin Franklin doesn't have a job, a family, or kids, and yet it his interactions with the Young family that allow both them and he to better themselves.Now, if you've seen the movie, you're probably reading this and thinking, This guy's nuts. He's completely overanalyzing some stupid comedy. Well, perhaps I am. Houseguest is indeed a silly, hectic fish-out-of-water comedy; somewhat formulaic, but very much successful. However, to dismiss the film as 'bad' or a 'stupid comedy' is a superficial assessment of a film that really has a lot going for it.Sure, the film is glossy and not without faults, but then, so is life and the people that we interact with. Houseguest is a winning comedy, and one of my favorite films of the 1990s. It presents laughs but also provides a realistic look at individual and family life in the '90s, even if this comes out of an unrealistic set-up of a man assuming another identity to avoid the mob.Much-maligned and underappreciated, Houseguest is a gem of a family comedy that I certainly hope you will give a chance. Or if you initially didn't like it, some more thought on these matters and maybe a second chance.

The premise has been done time and time again, it's basically a fish out of water story. Yes, the gangsters are dumb almost to the point where they're annoying. Sure, we see the message coming from a mile away.But there are a few things that separate this film from other comedies, and elevate to the status of excellence. First of all, it's hilarious. There are few jokes that don't work and they are immediately forgotten as this fast-paced romp wastes no time. The speed-up of scenes and the quick editing (several shots seem to last for no longer than a few seconds) do get a slight bit irritating, but it serves its purpose by catering to the fast-paced story and Sinbad's style of comedy. Take for instance, the party scene in which Sinbad is explaining what the GFH on his suit jacket stands for. Slow down the scene, and it loses the humor.Since the McDonald's issue has been cited again and again in reviews with varying degrees of criticism, let me address it briefly. First of all, there are a lot of people who love to eat McDonald's food. It's not healthy for you, but you'd be lying if you say that it tastes awful. Now, Sinbad's character is established as the lazy, unhealthy, always-eating slacker from the very beginning as he comes home to his apartment and enjoys his McDonald's and 2 liter bottle of soda. The real Derek Bond is completely contrasted with the impostor Derek Bond's lifestyle. Hence the fish out of water comedy. Sinbad's character is put in a desperate situation where he assumes this other man's life and the man he is pretending to be is the complete opposite of him. He's got a successful career as a dentist and he maintains a strict diet of vegetables and muescli cereal. So, when Sinbad's Kevin Franklin character, in this awkward and unfamiliar situation of staying with a suburban family's house and pretending to be someone who everyone expects to be a health-conscious stuffy professional, manages to escape for a moment and sees the familiar golden arches, he's so happy that he feels like he's in a commercial. He knows McDonald's and in many places, McDonald's seems to be an unchanging, constant source of familiar greasy food. McDonald's works in the context of the film because it's a real fast-food place that we can relate to, because we've all eaten there at one time or another. To me, if there was some fictional place like Lou's Hamburgers, it wouldn't work. The character design might come through, but there could be no jingle resounding in our heads, and it'd take you out of the reality of the story (which I discuss in next paragraph). Yes, McDonald's is a real fast-food joint, and Kevin Franklin loves to eat there. Does that make Houseguest a McDonald's commercial? I don't think that it does, I think it maintains an element of reality that we as viewers can relate to. Perhaps we needn't always be so cynical as some professional film critics are.Now, I mention the 'reality' of Houseguest and you must think I'm absolutely crazy. Houseguest is an unrealistic film that requires you to throw logic out the door entirely if you wish to enjoy it, right? Well, not necessarily. I think looking back at this film, eight years after it was made, we can look at the family suburban life depicted, and notice the real-ness of the characters.

He has to kill demons that live among humans, and that have the aspect of human beings.  The two boys are forced to witness and participate to the slayings, but the oldest, Fenton, has a different opinion on all that...Seems very simple?  I'm not telling you more than that, because any other detail about the plot would be too much...and let me tell you that the film is much more than that, really.  There is an impressive amount of sub-plots and it truly is one of the most complicated films since Curtis Hanson's L.A. Confidential.    Directed by Bill Paxton, known for his roles in James Cameron's Aliens and Sam Raimi's A Simple Plan among many others, this man proves that he's not only a good actor, but also a very promising director.  Paxton's film is dark, hypnotic, it truly has a creepy atmosphere that reminds of Danny Boyle's Shallow Grave.  The film is structured in two different periods of time, one is the sons' youth, and the other is their adulthood, but both of them are haunting and amazingly moody and well-done.   The acting is really great too, and the boys surprised me...personally, except for Danny Lloyd in Stanley Kubrick's The Shining and a couple of other young actors that did a good job, I didn't see god young actors very often...but these guys are very good.  Bill Paxton, Matthew McConaughey and Powers Boothe all made an extremely good job acting, especially Paxton, who plays a very believable and likeable father that is tormented and deranged but still believes in what he does.  His character is full of dilemmas, goodness, and a part of evil (that borrows the name of good in the film).  McConaughey reminds me of Kevin Spacey's character in Brian Synger's The Usual Suspects.  You'll have to see the film to understand what I just said...really. Powers Boothe is great too, with another character that brings plot twists, even though that could be the last thing you'd expect.  Great acting.   And now, a very strong element in this film, the scenario.  It is really good.  It takes the skeleton of an horror movie, to which rich plot twists are added in addition of interesting characters we TRULY care about.  And that's a rare thing in an horror film. The dialogues are quite good, and the story, even though it may first sound pretty simple is very developped and complex.  Brent Hanley (the man that wrote the film) is close to Christopher McQuarrie (the scenarist of The Usual Suspects) and I'd even say he (kind of) has more merit because he made an HORROR film scary and truly intelligent taking a different path than Stephen King with The Shining, which has intelligent horror based on insanity...Frailty, somehow, took this path, but wrote a scenario that could still make sense in a Crime film or Film-Noir...and he still gave a scary flavor to his story, and Paxton enriched it with his nice directing.  Hanley is the Ray Bradbury of these days, really.     Overall, those who are tired of recent horror films (the boring Resident Evil, the ridiculous Queen of The Damned, or the fundamentally awful Valentine, among others) will be pleased.  People who think horror movies are stupid will be stunned.  People that believe horror movies contain gallons of blood will be speechless.  This film is very good.  Very good.  It is entertaining, but not in the usual Hollywood way to be entertained...there are no special effects, no CGI, no creature effects, no gore...but that's not the point!  This is an (unfortunately) unusual way to make an horror movie...this film is original, simple but at the same time very complex (you may need more than one viewing to catch it all).  You'll watch five minutes of it, and you'll be hooked until the very uncommon and GREAT ending. Some scenes are disturbing for the characters, but not for the viewer, the nuance is that the viewer feels how disturbed the characters are, and we feel really close to them...that's how an horror film should work! Also, there are many discussion topics in this film, and they question many things and believe me, this film will make many think...especially about religion.  Frailty criticizes religion, especially the way believers understand it.  Frailty has many faces, it's a rich film, and it is very enjoyable, especially for those who love horror films.  But the range of viewers is much wider than that. Haunting film.  Great directing and scenario.  Oh yeah, and acting too.

No, that isn't doing this movie justice. This is a masterpiece. No other rock opera, or most movies in general, can top the insanity that is this movie. This movie peers into the mind of an over protected, reclusive, and sometimes violent rock star, who has taken enough of life and the people in it. This is the story of Pink, poor old Pink, who's father left him one morning in black 44', and who's mother was so protective she smothered him with her love and all of her fears; who's wife tried so hard to open his heart, but found that nobody was home; and who eventually built a wall so high that he could not break free, and eventually his seclusion from the outside world brought out a side of Pink that he, nor the rest of the world, would wish to ever see. Soon his sadistic, Hitler-esc side takes control of the world, with help from his zombie like fans who follow any command that is thrown at them.But by the time the dictator is mentally faded away by Pink, and he is able to see that shielding himself from the world with his now endless wall is only driving him crazier, it could be too late. So goes the quote above, taken from The Trial, which is the end of the Wall, and Pink's last chance for freedom from his Wall. This is just an outstanding movie. Everything works in this movie, the  twisted live action, the animation that probably is what being insane is like, and, most of all, the music that is, in my opinion, the greatest album ever created (to Hell with Dark Side of the Moon, it was good, but it doesn't even compare to The Wall). Pink Floyd is my favorite band (along with The Who and The Rolling Stones, an odd combination, I know), and when their best album was made into a movie, I knew that Hollywood had at least a little common sense, even though Hollywood shunned it, and most of the reviews I've read here are negative, but I don't care, I'm watching it and enjoying for me, and no other opinion matters. My favorite songs off of this movie\/album are Mother, One of My Turns, There's Nobody Home, Comfortably Numb (probably my favorite song, actually), and, of course, The Trial.  One last thing, if you are ever in a position where you have to choose between this and Tommy, pick this, because Tommy wasn't very good.

This movie peers into the mind of an over protected, reclusive, and sometimes violent rock star, who has taken enough of life and the people in it. This is the story of Pink, poor old Pink, who's father left him one morning in black 44', and who's mother was so protective she smothered him with her love and all of her fears; who's wife tried so hard to open his heart, but found that nobody was home; and who eventually built a wall so high that he could not break free, and eventually his seclusion from the outside world brought out a side of Pink that he, nor the rest of the world, would wish to ever see. Soon his sadistic, Hitler-esc side takes control of the world, with help from his zombie like fans who follow any command that is thrown at them.But by the time the dictator is mentally faded away by Pink, and he is able to see that shielding himself from the world with his now endless wall is only driving him crazier, it could be too late. So goes the quote above, taken from The Trial, which is the end of the Wall, and Pink's last chance for freedom from his Wall. This is just an outstanding movie. Everything works in this movie, the  twisted live action, the animation that probably is what being insane is like, and, most of all, the music that is, in my opinion, the greatest album ever created (to Hell with Dark Side of the Moon, it was good, but it doesn't even compare to The Wall). Pink Floyd is my favorite band (along with The Who and The Rolling Stones, an odd combination, I know), and when their best album was made into a movie, I knew that Hollywood had at least a little common sense, even though Hollywood shunned it, and most of the reviews I've read here are negative, but I don't care, I'm watching it and enjoying for me, and no other opinion matters. My favorite songs off of this movie\/album are Mother, One of My Turns, There's Nobody Home, Comfortably Numb (probably my favorite song, actually), and, of course, The Trial.  One last thing, if you are ever in a position where you have to choose between this and Tommy, pick this, because Tommy wasn't very good. In-fact, if it didn't have the great music of The Who in it, I would say it blew.

Therein lies its fatal flaw. Imagine if you will, taking a two-hour TV pilot that's painted in very broad strokes in order to keep enough of a plot going for a number of episodes, and then having to wrap it up in another half-hour so it can be released to theatres. Can't be done. Here. Watch this film if you don't believe me.Now, David Lynch has coughed up some interesting films and does try to do things a bit differently, I'll grant him that. And I get the sense that this was meant to be the kinda inverse of Twin Peaks -- that is, a fish out of water story turned inside out. So big points there.Plus, I hafta say the film *is* riveting, for the first two hours. You do get wrapped up in the weirdness, the mystery and (yes) the lesbian sex. But, before long, it all goes over the cliff before bursting into flames like a really bad car wreck. (Hmmm...)It's the ending -- the damn ending that gives it in.

After being shot down, he becomes the target of obsessed Serbian rebels and is forced to go on the run to safety.  Meanwhile, another battle is being fought on board the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson.  Burnett's commanding officer, Admiral Leslie Reigart (Gene Hackman) is fighting to get him back, even at the risk of loosing his rank.First of all, I've heard that this film is loosely based on the true story of Captain Scott O'Grady, a Navy air force pilot who had been shot down over Bosnia and was forced to make his way to safety.  I do not know how closely this film follows those events and frankly I don't care.  Second, this film has an extremely high body count, even for a PG-13 action film.  The PG-13 rating was a mistake and severely I doubt that a war film could ever be this light-hearted.  Third, I'm an American.  I sure like to see the flag waving in certain scenes, but too much of that will often get in the way of story-telling, thus making anything that occurs very laughable.Owen Wilson is an extremely gifted actor and writer who is already on his way to Oscar stardom.  With his Oscar-nomination for Best Original Screenplay for last year's The Royal Tenenbaums (which he cowrote with Wes Anderson), you can see that he's obviously gifted.  But he will not get there any sooner if he keeps making films like Behind Enemy Lines.  He is extremely miscast here and he does not make a very believable action hero.As for Gene Hackman, an accomplished actor and Oscar-winner, he is what probably keeps this film on its feet and from becoming total crap.  I know that he has had his fair share of bad films, but his presence here is this films saving grace.Now the action scenes.  Many of the action scenes in Behind Enemy Lines are very chaotic and move at a rapid pace.  Camera techniques that were first pioneered in Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan are put to use here, but are very poorly shot.  In fact, because of that, the action scenes come off as being very cheesy and not even realistic.As I stated above, many of the action scenes are poorly thought out and are badly edited.  One scene has Owen Wilson running through a mine field. This scene stands out in particular as being the worst because he's running through it and doesn't get a single scratch, even though there are mines exploding and that there is debris everywhere.  It's ridiculous because this makes him come off as being some sort of superhero or something.There's also another scene where Wilson is forced to switch uniforms with a dead soldier.  As he's walking away from the soldiers disguised as one their own, he removes his hat to reveal to the audience of what had just happened. PLEASE!!!I remember all the hype that been surrounding this movie about a day prior to its release on VHS and DVD.  I remember that one of the ads said that the film was a celebration of the American spirit.  Hardly.  All Behind Enemy Lines is an action film masquerading as a war film.

Anytime when Meg or anyone had to dart out of the room for a quick second (in slo-mo, of course), then you feel like your heart is about ready to jump out of your chest. Camera work by Conrad Hall and Darius Khondji was exceptional. When they panned throughout the house, it may be unnecessary, but it still looks wicked cool. It doesn't rely on split-screens or quick cuts or half-second scenes, it just is smooth and graceful.Foster was pretty good as Meg, but she wasn't anything Oscar-worthy. I thought that Stewart was uneven as her daughter, her feelings were mixed and changed at the drop of a hat. The three criminals (Jared Leto, Dwight Yoakam, Forest Whitaker) were pretty good and their bickering looked like it wasn't staged. Many people have complained about the ending. I'm one of them. It seemed abrupt and unlikely, but it's a Hollywood movie. It doesn't have to be original. And the last scene at the bench was unnecessary, two minutes of added time. It was long enough already. I wished that they could have had the entire movie take place in the house and only a couple characters, that would have made it a more inviting premise.All in all, Panic Room is a very tense movie that pales on characters but still makes you be creeped out of your mind.My rating 8\/10Rated R for language and some violence. ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"10 November 2002","score":"","review":"  OK, it's rated PG-13 because it has teen partying, language, sexual content and a fight. So you might think already, it's stupid, and you should save your money. Yet, this one is worth it. Instead of it being all about going out and wasting your life over some stupid guy\/girl you've met the night\/day before, the main character (played well by Kate Bosworth) meets her boyfriend on a wave (I don't remember who it is but he was good too).After her mother leaves her, Kate Bosworth is destined to win an annual surf competition. She has been training all year for this and she doesn't want to blow it. She and her two best friends work in a hotel, until one day she gets fired. Her sister is a smoker, so she doesn't have the most charming life style. She meets a boy when she's trying to teach him how to surf. But meeting him soon takes up her life. She comes home late and leaves her friends and sister by themselves.What makes this movie better than other sports teen movies, is that it focuses more on the sport, than just falling in love.

My other main criteria is that it touches me in some way that I can relate to. This movie did both.  It made me cry.  As soon as I saw it I wanted to run home and call my boyfriend and tell him how much I love him because as Chuck found out, you never know how much time you'll have.  It broke my heart to know that two people so deeply in love could not be together, and I could feel the pain of that separation.  That, to me, makes this an incredible film.

It's not a romantic comedy, it's a story about people. Don't walk in expecting a formula film. Life isn't a formula, life is a stream of events that happen to you and you try to make it work out anyway. The Mexican celebrates this idea by joining the characters in the middle of their life's adventures, Pitt trying hard to unwind the crazy coil that events that life has wrapped him and Roberts in against their will, and Roberts wriggling with learning this life lesson. Pitt and Roberts DO have chemistry, and it's a real world *reactive* chemistry. What happens when Pretty Woman meets Fight Club? Boom!! The two stars lead different sides of the plot line through most of the movie showing they are two different people seeing the situation in their own way, and then they come together and tumble into each other as they try to express their love. The movie doesn't try to sugar coat love and life, it celebrates it's excitement! And on the way there are a whole load of twists, some great acting, some surprises, some mystery, and some hilarious ironic and even dark humor. The movie isn't your normal Hollywood formula pap, it's more like a big budget art film. I don't think most people get that. Don't hold on while you watch, let go and enjoy the ride! I've seen it in the theatre, on DVD and on TV, and each time I walk away smiling.
