It's quite distinctive from other films in its genre. It certainly is not your typical superficial, stereotypical, formulaic Hollywood film.Simon Hughes, the director, is well-known for his left-wing attitudes in films such as The Breakfast club or Ferris Buller and this is no different. It portrays a working class teenager, Andie, who falls in love with a much richer boy called Blaine. As can be imagined their love is not straightforward and they face cultural conflicts from family and friends. They do end up getting together at the end but its the way that the film is made that makes it so unique.There is a great deal of realism in the film. The social issues that Andie faces such as mockery by other pupils, dealing with an unemployed father are placed in an intelligent manner making the viewers understand her problems. Watching the contrasting attitudes of the rich and the poor is not always far from the truth. The humorous parts of the film are not slapstick or silly but are more subtle such as Duckie's singing moment.Most importantly the message of the film is positive that materialism is irrelevant and that relationships are more important. There is nothing pretentious or 'cool' about this film which is why I like it. It is a film that is quite realistic and done in a genuine manner which is what makes it so successful.

Killed by a mob years before, Krueger lives in the dreams of the children of Elm Street and is out for revenge.Running a relatively tried and tested formula, this film has the disbelieving parents, the heroine who must defeat the forces of evil and the excessively gruesome deaths. Operating on a tiny budget though, Craven is forced to limit the action to moments of extremity and as a result the film suffers.With a cast of four main teens, Craven's film is obviously limited in the potential headcount (the excessive deaths in gory style being preserved for the more recent, graphics driven films) and is also not helped by weak acting. Heather Langenkamp as Nancy attempts to play the role as something more than it is, and is not particularly good as Krueger's eventual nemesis. Alongside her, Johnny Depp in his big screen debut is mediocre as the nice boyfriend and it actually feels quite satisfying to see what happens to his character. On the opposing force of evil, even Robert Englund as Krueger is rather weak with his limited screen time and headcount. Whilst Krueger will eventually develop as a character over future films, in this first encounter he never really gets going and is rather pathetic.The ultimate problem with this film however is not the acting but more how the film has dated badly. With typical 1980's style clothing and film quality, it's like going back to a time which nobody really cares about. It's a shame really because whilst this film used to be worthy of merit, now it's more like watching a history lesson.

It was only when I switched to Japanese that it all seemed to make sense. Don't ask me why, like I said I guess it's intonation. Furthermore, it's always daft not to see a movie in its original language. And that goes for anime too, unless you still believe it's not real film.But this is! OK, we've seen the story about nature vs humans before (after all, is that not what the Arthur \/ Merlin \/ Morgana \/ Mob legends are all about?), but what makes this one stand apart is 2 things 1. no one is all good or all evil; 2. the visuals are stunning and testify of an imagination unbound by logic. These 2 points are crucial, for it is there that most Disney films or plain Hollywood films go wrong - one could say that they're made by 5 year olds. But no, it's just the reverse! Most Disney animation and Hollywood stuff is made by 'soundly reasoning' adults with an emotional life not reaching beyond love and hate, motivational insight not going beyond revenge (or getting laid) and an imagination enslaved to logic. This film isn't, and as a consequence some call it 'difficult'. And not suitable for children.

However, though this is obviously Miyazaki's second best (after Laputa), it remains difficult to pour all the complex musings about man's relationship to nature in 2 hours (the Nausicaa manga is over a 1000 pages long and took him 13 years; when it was finished he made Mononoke). Hence, some things (like Ashitaka helping out Eboshi even after she's done such evil deeds) have left some viewers bewildered. In all, I found the persona of Nausicaa (in the manga) more fit, in her responsible role as a princess, to convey The Message than the split version here. Still, the very idea about man & technology vs. nature and the question of is anything ever over (ewige wiederkehr, the cycle of life) is at its most nuanced here.

While this is less true of the latter episodes in the franchise, parts one through eight are so alike in their 1980s chic that it's hard to be surprised when one learns that the studio was cranking them out once a year. Other franchises that cranked out sequels once every twelve months include the Police Academy franchise. Need I say more?If you've seen the original FT13, you've seen part two.

This film is Hitchcock during his prime, but, unfortunately, the theme is oversimplified to the point of making the film far less that what it could have been. Sure, psychoanalysis is not a subject easily fit into a two-hour film, but maybe it shouldn't be compressed into that; it should either be done right, in a film entirely dedicated to depicting a true-to-life psychoanalysis, or at least treated with more respect and thought than it is here. The dream interpretation scene in this film will seem a mockery to any true psychologist or psychiatrist. Very little is done to make it appear the way it is in real life, and, like I said earlier, it is oversimplified to the point of being fed to a mainstream crowd with no problems(think the hacking scenes of Swordfish). Apart from that somewhat minor criticism, I really enjoyed this movie, and so would any horror\/Hitchcock fan. It's very much his style, and is a prime example of his excellent film-making. He was indeed an incredibly talented director. I love the way he slowly builds up a story, only to suddenly introduce a character or an event and have the rest of the movie revolve around that character or event. The story is very good in this one, and if it hadn't been oversimplified, it could easily have gotten a perfect score, in my opinion. The plot is very good, it has a good pace, and the way the story slowly unravels is excellent. The acting is great, both of the leads do exceptionally well, and most of the supporting cast is good. The characters are well-written, credible and well-cast. The suspense is very good, and the intensity of some scenes will leave you as a nervous wreck. The mystery was great, and kept you guessing to the very end. The film's editing is also very good, some of the best in a Hitchcock film, and that's saying a lot. The special effects are surprisingly good, for such an old film. The cinematography is every bit as excellent as just about every other Hitchcock film. A few final notes; though I did find the interpretation scene a little too simplified, I enjoyed the dream sequence itself immensely. Some of Hitchcock's best directed work, in terms of 'spooky and disturbing' factor. Though I normally loathe romance subplots, I found this one to be sufficiently credible and entertaining, and it didn't feel out of place. Finally, despite the subject and theme of psychoanalysis being terribly simplified, I enjoyed the various scenes of such analysis in the film, as well as the various twists related to it. Very good job on that, Mr. Hitchcock. All in all, a very good Hitchcock mystery-thriller that most fans of such will enjoy, even if it is just a little oversimplified. I recommend it to any fan of Hitchcock and the genres of mystery and thriller. I guess most people who have more than just a little awareness on the subject of psychoanalysis should take it with a grain of salt, or not see it at all. As said by Alfred Hitchcock when David O.

We don't see him at home or expressing his doubts of frustrations to camera - this is done by others. Food and sex are his drug, but what else is there for him?He is single and talks of his past conquests with pride, but there is a little sadness beneath the surface. He talks of marriage to a woman who has yet to appear on the horizon and might never do so.We meet the usual crew of industry names and they give their little bit-to-camera about his large penis, party habits, personal hygiene (fat guys often look smelly even freshly showered), spending habits, but I was not bothered. I doubt anybody is, apart from the college jocks that think along the lines of the more sex you get the better. Don't worry they will learn the truth later. No one can make a good documentary about Ron Jeremy simply because I am not that interested in Ron Jeremy. He is on the run from the 9-2-5 - something that I am as well incidentally - but eventually it pulls us all back in. He has become institutionalised to porn - something that doesn't happen to female talent who usually burnout after about three years - and thinks that this is his natural home.He can't go on forever, but I am sure he will find some niche as a producer, director or even a prop shifter. While I didn't feel sorry for him because he is in the sex business, I feel sorry for him because there is nothing in life that really makes him happy. The best he can come up with is cheap thrills - which are no substitute. This film left me with a giant feeling of so what. There is too much happening in the big wide world to care about one little man's struggle in his self-chosen little show-biz niche.Ron is not a bad guy and he shows good manners, but he lives in a world where anyone will say or do anything for money - a world where even blonde teenage girls will say that they enjoy having sex with fat, sweaty, middle aged men on camera...

It has several strong points including performances, story, and direction. First of all, Sean Connery's performance is wonderfully truthful and inspiring. It's entertaining to watch him, especially when he's given lines that only he could possibly get away with. New-comer, Rob Brown, is also very good, perhaps not as good as Connery, but considering this is his first film, he does an excellent job. There were certainly some interesting camera angles as well, which made the film more interesting; props to director Gus Van Sant on that.A weaker point in the film was the music which, although it worked in this particular film, was not terribly interesting to listen to, nor did it really heighten the film for me.On the whole, Finding Forrester is a strong film with good messages about overcoming obstacles, racial issues, and our own personal fears. Highly recommended.8 out of 10 stars.

Anyone who watches this expecting it to be superior to the original Japanese versions of the Godzilla films will be greatly unimpressed, as Godzilla here looks and acts much less menacing than in those 1950s and 60s classics. Quite literally, this movie is almost like Jurassic Park set in Manhattan, as Godzilla looks much more like a dinosaur than a creature spawned from radiation. Additionally, we actually see very little of Godzilla as a whole, as over half of the shots of the monster are of its tail swinging or a closeup of one of its eyes. In reality, this movie could be called The Worm Guy Story, as way too much time is spent focusing on Matthew Broderick's character (The Worm Guy) and it seems at time that Godzilla is secondary to his trials and tribulations. I actually cannot recommend this movie at all, and I nearly shut it off halfway through it was so lame. Avoid it and rent one of those Japanese originals for a good time!

This time, Antonio Banderas steps into the role of the troubled Mariachi as he continues his quest to rid Mexico of the corrupted drug lord that destroyed his life. Using friends like Steve Buscemi, he finds the town that is harboring his villain named Bucho. The Mariachi's form of questioning normally leads to several dead, a cinematic gun fight, and some classic Sergio Leone verbiage. Unfortunately, our hero does not escape unscathed and finds himself being healed by the likes of Carolina, a bookstore beauty played by Selma Hayek. Together they build a steamy relationship that will help our Mariachi reach his final destination.As more gunfights, explosions, and blood rock this independent blockbuster, we soon discover a hidden secret about our hero, one that could change the course of his destination.This was an impressive second outing by director Robert Rodriguez. While I was worried that Hollywood would have drained too much of his imagination, it was instead the direct opposite. Hollywood gave him the tools to build an amazing 'sequel'. While different, yet the similar to his independent feature 'El Mariachi', Rodriguez sets the stage for a roller coaster film that makes you hold your breath and pray for more. He has taken elements from his first film and expanded them to new levels. Banderas is perfect as our 'new' Mariachi and the chemistry between him and Selma Hayek cannot be contested. Banderas' ability to control this enraged man was spectacular. They worked as our two main focuses of this film. Coupled with some humorous moments with Steve Buscemi and Quentin Tarantino, this film successfully stood on its own two feet thanks not just to the action, but the actors in their respective roles. Finally, Rodriguez is a genius behind the camera. He is able to give us exactly the right amount of action, drama, and comedy for our liking. He is the proverbial salad bar of cinema. While giving us this deeply rooted character hell-bent on destroying this drug lord, he also lets our imaginations wander with his comical and cartoonish action sequences. The scenes of men flying through the air after being shot are somewhat comical, yet completely Rodriguez. He has successfully created this world that is all uniquely his own. Rodriguez has done this by giving the world depth and outside characters. He builds suspense and also suspicion all at the same time.Overall, an amazing film (in case you haven't noticed) that should be found in nearly everyone's film collection.

Mankiewicz was a genius and this is his masterpiece, without a doubt! Mr. Mankiewicz's timeless tale for this film was something that paralleled the great writing of another author that knew the inside of the human race Honore de Balzac.In this story about the theater, all the elements come together to weave a perfect movie, one that will endure the passage of time. Mr. Mankiewicz's screen play is about blind ambition and to what extremes does a person goes in order to realize that goal. The writer seems to be telling us that to Eve Harrington, her end justified the means by which she arrived at getting where she got.The cast assembled for the movie was the perfect blend of styles and acting ability. This film is dominated by Eve Harrington, who, Anne Baxter plays to perfection. We first see her as the adoring fan to Margo Channing, the star of the hit play on Broadway. She will do anything to get to where Margo Channing is. In a way, Eve is a user of the worst kind. She used Karen Richards, Margo's best friend in order to get in the theater world where she finally makes a splash.In that theatrical world, we encounter all kinds of sub species that tend to gravitate toward the limelight where others are shining brighter. They will do anything in their power in order to 'belong' to the glamour and all the things that go hand in hand in that circle.Anne Baxter was an amazing Eve Harrington. She was a young actress then, who showed a lot of talent and was perfectly cast for that role. Bette Davis makes Margo Channing come alive. Ms. Davis shows us what is to be at the top of her class and suddenly see her world begin to crumble, which in a way, it's the way of the theater. The theater and the movies are cruel to the stars that dare to age in front of our eyes. There will always be prettier and younger actresses to bask in their moment of glory in front of the adoring public, but watch out, never get old!George Sanders as the bitchy Addison Dewitt, is the maker and breaker of many a career. He has the power to destroy anyone that doesn't play by his rules. Mr. Sanders was excellent by being the cynic in a make believe land. In a way, the writer is telling us that even then, there was something rotten in theater critics that will ruin a play by just disliking it in the press. Celeste Holm is also effective as Karen Richards, a friend indeed, until she is used to give Eve her big break. Thelma Ritter is a delight to watch as Birdie, the wise maid that sees right through a phony when she sees one. Gary Merrill, George Ratoff, Hugh Marlowe and a young and fresh Marilyn Monroe complete the cast.Never before did a movie packed such an impact to reveal so much about the human comedy, as in this one. After all, that comedy, or call it tragedy, has existed since the beginning of time. All this because a brilliant Joseph L. Mankiewicz brought to the screen to dazzle audiences forever.

What makes this movie so good, is that you have several different stories wrapped into one movie! We have an old school mobster who is thinking of changing his ways and becoming a full blown Christian, we have a mobster\/Elvis fan who is assigned to watch over his bosses wife while he was out of town, and all hell breaks loose, We have a boxer who has the opportunity to become rich, but at the expense of losing his pride, we have the story of a suitcase that must be delivered to a mob boss, and finally, we have the story of a mobster named THE WOLF who has to help two mobsters clean out a car that is covered in blood and brains. The stories are not in this order exactly, but still yet, we have several different stories tied into one excellent movie. Once again, Tarantino gives us a wonderful cast with brilliant actors John Travolta, Samuel Jackson, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, and the very beautiful Uma Thurman.
