[{"date":"19 August 2006","score":"5 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" A vastly underrated film that was practically ignored by both critics and viewers, Divorcing Jack is a highly enjoyable, and often powerful, film with a terrific cast and a very clever title that keeps you interested to the last minute. It's good to see David Thewlis, one of the finest British actors of his generation, play the lead in a British film &#150; as he did in his prime, and not a side character in Hollywoodian films like Harry Potter. His performance in Divorcing Jack isn't quite as remarkable as the one he gave five years before in Naked but it's fantastic by its own right, and just like in Naked Thewlis creates an anti-hero that is egoistic, weak, detestable, and entirely believable; if you're looking for a noble hero to sacrifice himself for the greater good because that's the right thing to do, look elsewhere. Dan Starkey cares for himself and makes excuses for nobody; and that makes him a protagonist you can relate to.There are some neat surprises in the supporting cast Australian born Rachel Griffiths &#150; AKA Brenda Chenowith of HBO's terrific Six Feet Under &#150; who was practically anonymous in 1998, is terrific as Thewlis' prostitute-in-nun's-clothing sidekick, and supplies some of the film's funniest moments. Jason Isaacs, who, like Thewlis, has recently familiarized himself with American audiences through the Harry Potter movies, in bone-chillingly excellent in the lead villain role. The beautiful Laura Fraser (who had recently made a career for herself in Hollywood with supporting roles in movies like Titus, Vanilla Sky, and A Knight's Tale; but anyone who happened to catch the excellent BBC mini-series Neverwhere will surely remember her as the charming Door) has a part that's brief but unforgettable. American TV regular Richard Grant is lovely and believable as the visiting reporter from the US who came to cover the upcoming elections but is more interested in learning about the difference between the different types of scotch. And experienced British actor Robert Lindsay steals the show as the dodgy candidate. Finally, a brief but hilarious cameo from the charming Bronagh Gallagher (The Commitments) as a taxi driver.The film's messages about the horrors and idiocy of war and particularly the Irish civil war are familiar and would have been corny in a straight drama, but as in Catch-22 and other classic black comedies, the absurd humor of the film makes it powerful. If you take any of the two aspects of the film &#150; comedic or political &#150; and separate it from the other, maybe it really isn't all that good. Perhaps that's why it failed to find its audience in the US and most of Europe. Myself, I've lived my entire life in Israel, and am familiar with a war between two neighboring factions that always seems on the brink of resolution just before the situation explodes again, and that has its highest price in the innocent lives of people on both sides who just want to be left alone in peace, while the leaders of both peoples carry on their senseless warmongering. Divorcing Jack has a simplistic view of the situation but it's important to make it heard. The ending is inevitable and almost predictable, yet it's the only proper ending this story could possibly have. Divorcing Jack is highly recommended; it's neither a romantic comedy nor a straight thriller, but it's a good and powerful film to enjoy and to think about.

However, I'd encourage folk to watch it as its an old-fashioned yarn featuring some splendid cameos from a strong cast of supporting actors. As for the stars - well Messrs Niven, Peck and Moore aren't perhaps stretched too much but they do enough to show just why they were the stars. I think its called 'screen presence'. Peck's accent - a plucky effort and far from the worst I've heard.A few minor points Why was the film made? Am I alone in suspecting that the director had a key role? Andy McLaglen had a penchant for casting favourite actors (a John Ford influence) and a scenario like this with ample opportunity to cast screen veterans would have appealed. He was also the son of the redoubtable Anglo-Irish actor Victor McLagan, an old soldier who (as you'll find elsewhere on IMDb)in the 1930s organised a semi-militaristic polo club called the 'Light Horse Brigade'. A coincidence - surely not, it must have appealed to McLaglen to publicise the story of another 'Light Horse' that did get to 'do its bit'.On the German resistance. These were not crack Nazi stormtroopers - they were mainly merchant sailors (tho some would have had naval experience). They were also taken by surprise in a neutral port where they were happily sitting out the duration. Given those circumstances they put up a rather good fight in the film - and its to be noted four German survivors of the raid were advisers on the movie.On people being shot in the arm. Were they supposed to invent extra British characters so they could kill them? On the whiskey - its the men's cover if the raid went off half-cocked as was quite possible.On the dedication - Mountbatten was the wartime commander in the area of operations including the Indian Ocean. Being made so soon after his murder it must have appealed to McLaglen (British-born of Protestant Irish stock) to remind the viewers again that not all old soldiers get to live out their retirement peacefully. We should also recall the two teenage boys (one of them local) and the 83-year old woman killed along with Mountbatten in that terrorist atrocity.Finally, I like the closing moments when the men are gazing at the burning ships. No champagne, no cheers, no high fives - just a comment of 'poor devils'.

I happened to stumble across 'City Lights', in which the comedy still holds up.What makes the film still good is the simplicity of the comedy. The situations are common, everyday and relatable to and most things that MIGHT go wrong, do; given the circumstances. These apply to going to a restaurant, fighting in a boxing match and spending time in someone else's home. Early on during the statue scene, everything is placed into context and the scene serves as a good introduction to the film and its content. This is good for people first encountering Chaplain and this is the perfect introduction to his world of 'slapstick humour'. The things that could possibly go wrong; do and everything has an eerie sense of realism. 'What would happen if a tramp was indeed sleeping during a statue unveiling?' or indeed, got involved in any of the other situations in this film. One thing I found particularly interesting was the instance where everyone paused to respect the national anthem, even the tramp amongst the chaos. Nobody moved during the anthem and although they were trying to get him down initially, everything stops for the anthem &#150; everything. I found this an interesting little piece of propaganda but very humorous at the same time No matter what's going on around you, always stop to respect the nation when given the chance.What's also interesting is the narrative in the film. Narrative film making was around but was only about a decade or two old. In other films from around the time, narratives were still pretty basic but they got their story across, albeit maybe jumbled. In City Lights, the love story is put across effectively and the whole side story of the drunken millionaire\/Chaplain trying to raise money is well sewn in; this adds to the effectiveness of the ending, also. What I like is the feeling of the character just wondering around, living day to day life, encountering people and things. There is that feeling of chance throughout. The backgrounds, given the date, are equally as interesting.Although you do see some gags coming, for instance the spaghetti scene where the similar looking decorations lurk menacingly above, City Lights does enough; with its love story, simplistic and comic situations mixed with actual humour such as the 'I thought you were driving' scene and the bad effect the lucky charms have on the boxers prior to the fight scene and the fact that there's enough in the film for you to take it seriously, especially the ending.'City Lights' will remain a classic.

Crash is one of these films I completely decried the first time I had watched it. Actually, I reacted like a part of David Cronenberg's fans whereas it's the kind of film that requires a second vision. So, I watched it again recently and I changed my mind about it. If before this screening I tended to put Cronenberg's opus in the place of loser and to underscore its pretentious character, now I would label it as a winner and I would substitute the mentioned epithet for dour.If my memory serves me well, Crash caused a lot of controversy when it reached the streets ten years ago in some countries including Great Britain. Adapted from a novel written by J.G. Ballard, I think it sharply contrasts with some of the director's precedent works. In these works, the Canadian filmmaker let his taste for bloody horror show through, especially his early films like Shivers (1975) or Rabid (1977). However, in some of his films, he managed to shelve these excesses for a more thrifty style. I think of Dead Ringers (1988). Crash could rank in this category. There are no bloody sequences. Anyway, it's easy to see why Cronenberg was interested in Ballard's novel. It offered him the opportunity to deepen his set of themes like the degradation of the human body and everything harmful that can happen to it but also the fusion between man and technology (here, it's epitomized by its most trivial symbol car). What's also amazing from him is that he succeeded in eschewing any didactic style to be as objective as possible. Dialogs are minimal and are mostly self-explanatory like this key cue pronounced by Vaughan the remodeling of human body through modern technology.So, the main thrust of the film is that the car crash enables to boost man's sexual life. The supposedly love affair between man and the car reaches here its climax. Vaughan even goes to associate car crashes with sexual orgasms. To a certain extent, the clandestine shows in which he reproduces famous crashes constitute a way to follow for people who are unsatisfied with their sexual lives. The Ballard couple whose sexual life is reduced to a series of overnight love affairs realizes it and enjoys this dangerous game in which death could happen before the second part of this design sexual act. Cronenberg's film goes beyond this to arouse major issues could technology swallow man? Can the two elements live together? Could the latter lose his identity? There's one sequence I find very strong. It's the one when Catherine and James go to buy a new car and Catherine has hidden her scars under an appearance made of leather and metal. As I said before, Cronenberg opted for a thrifty and sober style. This perspective is shown straight at the outset during the opening credits to the sound of a startling music. Then, the film takes a leap into a dreary universe with a metallic coldness and a gloomy cinematography that Cronenberg never tries to embellish. Relationships between man and the machine are assessed in a hard-hitting way and the characters often speak in a detached manner between themselves. Could car crashes make warm human relationships subside except through sex? Of course, to watch such a difficult film like this one takes guts but for the ones who haven't discovered it yet, Crash isn't a succession of erotic sequences interspersed with crashes. It's more subtle than that and if Cronenberg chose a more straightforward approach, it's precisely to enable the audience to understand his film and to make us think about the issues he developed here. So, the first vision might leave you baffled so be prepared for a second screening.

The Ballard couple whose sexual life is reduced to a series of overnight love affairs realizes it and enjoys this dangerous game in which death could happen before the second part of this design sexual act. Cronenberg's film goes beyond this to arouse major issues could technology swallow man? Can the two elements live together? Could the latter lose his identity? There's one sequence I find very strong. It's the one when Catherine and James go to buy a new car and Catherine has hidden her scars under an appearance made of leather and metal. As I said before, Cronenberg opted for a thrifty and sober style. This perspective is shown straight at the outset during the opening credits to the sound of a startling music. Then, the film takes a leap into a dreary universe with a metallic coldness and a gloomy cinematography that Cronenberg never tries to embellish. Relationships between man and the machine are assessed in a hard-hitting way and the characters often speak in a detached manner between themselves. Could car crashes make warm human relationships subside except through sex? Of course, to watch such a difficult film like this one takes guts but for the ones who haven't discovered it yet, Crash isn't a succession of erotic sequences interspersed with crashes. It's more subtle than that and if Cronenberg chose a more straightforward approach, it's precisely to enable the audience to understand his film and to make us think about the issues he developed here. So, the first vision might leave you baffled so be prepared for a second screening.

I, however found a big love for the movie, my friends played Titanic on the playground, my friend owned the video and I eventually saw it, well half of it since I wasn't ready for the distress and peril. As I grew, I learned how cheesy, formulaic and just plain god awful this movie was.To start off, I think that the scenery, costumes and sets are magnificent, and some of the characters give life in their roles (The man who played the Captain, Victor Garber and Kathy Bates) the rest, however are just irritating and trying too hard to make their performance stand out. And they do, just not in a good way. Kate Winslet is just a snobby girl who obviously is misunderstood and wishes her mother would listen to her, Leonardo Dicaprio is just a vile, poor boy who seems an awful lot like a rude and bratty version of Tramp(Who is from a rich girl meets poor boy story that works, Lady and the Tramp.) Billy Zane plays Rose's Fiancé, Cal and uses an accent that mocks the British as do most of the other supporting actors. Plus, Cal is convinced that the ship is unsinkable, as is everyone, except Rose who is educated (apparently knowing who Freud is makes her a smart scholar.) But she's a girl! Why listen to her?! This Ship is Unsinakble! It is she who notices that they're aren't enough lifeboats, but is reassured once again by another man that the ship can't and won't sink. Enoguh on that, let us talk about the main plot.Titanic was a ship that was to sail from Ireland to New York, we all know that. But, it seems that the Director, James Cameron (Who is usually a good director and who redeemed himself with Ghosts of the Abyss.) does not know anything but that small fact, and that many Irish people were in third class. The many wonderful stories about the ship, not that the death of many people is a good thing, but that the tales survivors have passed down about their voyage on the Titanic. If James contacted the few still alive or read a book, he would maybe make this film get two stars for researching the stories of the ships passengers. Anyway, Rose is on the ship with her mother and fiancé, but she is not happy. Jack is a poor boy who wins tickets to the Titanic in a game of poker and lives his life to its fullest. They meat while suicidal Rose is about to jump and Jack won't let her. If this were the real world, any chance that these two would meet, or that she would even come near the third class deck would be very slim. So long story short, he saves her from falling. While doing so, the police hear screams coming from her and when they arrive, it appears that he is raping her. They arrest Jack, but Rose says that he saved her and he goes scotch free. Then, their bond begins.Already, within the first forty five minutes am I bored, waiting for the ship to sink and not center around these two bratty kids who never even existed, but the story makes them as big as the ship itself. So these two become friends and Jack teaches Rose how to live a little, which means he gets her to hock spit and dance at a drunken third class party and escape the upper prestigious class. Soon Rose begins to realize, Do I even love Cal? Is Jack the one for me? He understands her and she understands him, unfortunately her mother disapproves of their romance because he's poor and she's engaged. Rose then tries to end her romance with Jack, but like every other romance movie she goes with the man she just met and apparently the choice was right. They stand on the edge of the ship and fly, he draws her nude only wearing her necklace Cal gave to her as an engagement present. If you have been living in a cave or hopefully haven't heard of Titanic, these scenes are none as its most memorable, as is their sex scene in the back of a car. Luckily, the iceberg hits and all hell breaks loose. After Cal insisting it won't sink it does! And nobody listen to Rose! Cal wants her, but she says, I'd rather be a whore then your wife. Soon enough, Jack and Rose are together in the water all cold and near death, but they can still churn out cinematic waste. While watching it, I found their love being broken not as important as the many people dying right next to them. And before you know it, Jack dies. It would be pretty obvious because when a disaster occurs, one of the lovers is bound to die. Eventually, selfish Rose is rescued and calls herself Rose Dawson, which makes me laugh. She knows him for two days and then considers their little unimportant romance like marriage, Please. The end is when the diamond the explorers are searching for isn't found, Rose has it, she dumps it over the edge and then meets Jack in heaven. There, I saved you three hours of your life.Adding on to the boring love story, the music sounds like Enya half the time and the rest like music you hear in a Nordstrom's store at the mall(the theme is sung by sea wench Celene Dion another disaster for the film). The script sounds like a dreary English paper using vocabulary words I learned in seventh grade. At least it is when the two lovebirds aren't screaming Jack! Jack! or Rose!! The star goes to scenery, and it stays that way.

First i am appalled by the reviews i read saying that this movie looked visually stunning even in today's CGI era. To all those that believe this to be true i beg you to go to your doctor and get your cataracts examined as i am fearful to drive the same roads as you. Every scene involving a visual effect was so clearly fake that it is hard to give this world of the future much credibility as a real living and breathing entity. This highlights one of the first major mistakes Scott made in directing this movie. It is impossible to have a movie that is timeless when it is so clearly a casualty of the post Kubrick sci fi era of the early 80's. Why is it that the future world so resembles the 80's with its harsh lighting, big hair, punk rocker leather, and neon signs? Wouldn't the people of the future learn from the appalling aesthetic mistakes of the long forgotten 80's? Apparently not. Although it's clear Ridley Scott wanted to make the world dystopian and harsh it is so forced and so touched by 80's influences that it loses traction in the modern era. The good scenes, the ones that highlight the timeless nature of this film, are those that are inside and devoid of special effects. These scenes call a striking resemblance to the re noir movies of old with the long shadows that are cast and the gritty appeal they lend to the lonesome detective Harrison Ford portrays. So enough with the setting and abysmal effects and on to the story. Now overall the questions raised by this movie are not in the least original (read Frankenstein by Mary Shelly) nor mind blowing but they are none the less important. I praise any director who creates a movie in search of a higher meaning, a more important purpose than sheer entertainment, but i cannot laud a film that is completely devoid of believable action or a large enough explanation of its narrative. Many positive reviewers cite the film's ambiguity as its strength but i find this most foolish as the best of movies are able to spur debate while not being lost in their own vagueness. We know very little about Harrison Ford's character and the endless debates that follow around him are not in my opinion an extension of Scott's brilliance but rather a display of his contempt for his simple minded audience. The actors, with exception of Ford, are seemingly confused and out of place and so serious and so apathetic that it is impossible to care about them just as the world they live in cares little for their existence. They are all also so clearly displaced from the 1980's into 2017 culture which, as noted earlier, obviously has gained little in the way of advances. The Chemistry between Ford and his replicant lover is so inexistent that it makes me question whether or not this was Scott's intention. Perhaps it is just another buried metaphor about the nature of love in a sociopathic future, who knows. I believe that Scott's examination of what it is to be human and to what extent our apathy for human emotions exist, is poignant and very worthy of the praise he has received from many reviewers, however, the futuristic median by which he expresses it folds under the pressure of its own outdated style. It is disheartening to so a movie that has such good intentions be muddled by its sci fi median. Something that is so often the case with 80's era sci fi filmaking. Only movies such as the original Star Wars or Star Trek series have been able to so far stand the test of time without scrutiny, despite lacking the deep philosophical questions raised by a movie such as Blade Runner. As such i'm left deeply conflicted by this movie. I am assured that this movie will not stand as a timeless classic as the next generation of movie goers will find it slow and worthlessly outdated. And yet i hope more movies such as this will be made, ones that examine human complexities and bring them to light but i pray such films are able to do such without relying on technical visual style. Sci Fi is an almost impossible median by which such movies can be made since it seems technology moves so exponentially that things are outdated the second they come into existence. This is the, above all, major problem i have with Scott's movie. Any person under the age of 30 will find it laughably unbelievable and will therefore be less impressed by its message. The movies that are greatest transcend such scrutiny because they let their IDEAS exist at the forefront, not technology. As such i believe that if i were older, or seeing Blade Runner when it was initially released i would be much more impressed with it. But given that i cannot cling to nostalgia to alter my views of an obviously flawed movie i am left with a muddled, over the top, 80's style sci fi film, that has the greatest of messages wrapped in the most absurd of packaging. If you are under 30, no matter how mature or intellectual you are, i'd steer completely clear of this movie, it will bore you and make you apathetic to its complexities.

I praise any director who creates a movie in search of a higher meaning, a more important purpose than sheer entertainment, but i cannot laud a film that is completely devoid of believable action or a large enough explanation of its narrative. Many positive reviewers cite the film's ambiguity as its strength but i find this most foolish as the best of movies are able to spur debate while not being lost in their own vagueness. We know very little about Harrison Ford's character and the endless debates that follow around him are not in my opinion an extension of Scott's brilliance but rather a display of his contempt for his simple minded audience. The actors, with exception of Ford, are seemingly confused and out of place and so serious and so apathetic that it is impossible to care about them just as the world they live in cares little for their existence. They are all also so clearly displaced from the 1980's into 2017 culture which, as noted earlier, obviously has gained little in the way of advances. The Chemistry between Ford and his replicant lover is so inexistent that it makes me question whether or not this was Scott's intention. Perhaps it is just another buried metaphor about the nature of love in a sociopathic future, who knows. I believe that Scott's examination of what it is to be human and to what extent our apathy for human emotions exist, is poignant and very worthy of the praise he has received from many reviewers, however, the futuristic median by which he expresses it folds under the pressure of its own outdated style. It is disheartening to so a movie that has such good intentions be muddled by its sci fi median. Something that is so often the case with 80's era sci fi filmaking. Only movies such as the original Star Wars or Star Trek series have been able to so far stand the test of time without scrutiny, despite lacking the deep philosophical questions raised by a movie such as Blade Runner. As such i'm left deeply conflicted by this movie. I am assured that this movie will not stand as a timeless classic as the next generation of movie goers will find it slow and worthlessly outdated. And yet i hope more movies such as this will be made, ones that examine human complexities and bring them to light but i pray such films are able to do such without relying on technical visual style. Sci Fi is an almost impossible median by which such movies can be made since it seems technology moves so exponentially that things are outdated the second they come into existence. This is the, above all, major problem i have with Scott's movie. Any person under the age of 30 will find it laughably unbelievable and will therefore be less impressed by its message. The movies that are greatest transcend such scrutiny because they let their IDEAS exist at the forefront, not technology. As such i believe that if i were older, or seeing Blade Runner when it was initially released i would be much more impressed with it. But given that i cannot cling to nostalgia to alter my views of an obviously flawed movie i am left with a muddled, over the top, 80's style sci fi film, that has the greatest of messages wrapped in the most absurd of packaging. If you are under 30, no matter how mature or intellectual you are, i'd steer completely clear of this movie, it will bore you and make you apathetic to its complexities.

It had worked for those, especially as the first was a bit rough, feeling a bit like trying to find one's way in the darkness, and the second almost perfected the formula, even if that meant stumbling into a contradictorily attractive sewer. Of course, Death Wish 3 still basically a revenge flick featuring Charles Bronson as Paul Kersey, an oddly charismatic architect turned vigilante taking out hordes of theatrical punks, but Winner expands on the previous films here, bringing in allusions to other genres and films, and giving Death Wish 3 added thematic and emotional dimensions.One of the new dimensions may have been somewhat unintentional, but it's one of my favorite modes, so it worked extremely well for me--an absurdist humor that stems from the context of all three Death Wish films as a continual story. By this point in the series, Kersey has such incredibly bad luck--it seems that to be or become chummy with him in any way is virtually a death sentence--that it is hilarious. This aspect is amplified by the fact that Bronson deadpans his way through the film. So when he expresses hesitation for a romantic relationship because of past events, and both reassurance and disaster quickly follow, it's as funny as tragic in context of the three films. Winner also incorporates a lot of intentional humor and irony as the film progresses.Winner doesn't caricature his crime-ridden city as much as he did previously, but his gangs, or at least some gang members, still have a bit of Broadway to them. However, it's much easier to take the setting's anarchic state seriously, especially since Death Wish 3 is set in Brooklyn (the East New York section) during the tail end of its worst crime period. There is a bit of the feel and probably an influence from The Warriors (1979) here.The major way that Winner breaks his previous plot template is that this time most of Kersey's Brooklyn neighbors join in the fray. The idea is a lot of fun. It not only gives us a couple handfuls of attractive, new characters to root for, but it gives Death Wish 3 the opportunity to mix its usual mood with elements from both war films and westerns. The Mad Max films (1979 and 1981) also seem to have been an influence, and Aliens (1986) was to expand its plot in a similar way the following year.To make the war-like scope of Death Wish 3 believable, Winner also makes the smart move of putting the head of police, Richard S. Shriker (Ed Lauter), on Kersey's side, after a pleasantly gritty and surprising opening that first has them at loggerheads.Winner was also smart to retain most of Jimmy Page's score for Death Wish 2. That it's the same score isn't at all a minus, as Page primarily composed a series of leitmotifs for characters and moods, so they serve to give Death Wish 3 a more solid continuity from the previous film. The additional music here, which wasn't by Page, isn't nearly as good, which is making me a bit anxious about Death Wish 4, because Page's music was dropped there.For me, this is an odd series to this point because of the continual rise in the series' quality. I still have never watched Death Wish 4 or 5, so it will be interesting to see if the series can continue the trend. There isn't much further up to go.

I urge anyone who disliked this film to give it at least one more chance - I can honestly say that the film was way too far off the wall for me to appreciate it the first time I watched it.2001 is overflowing with iconic images, from the opening scene accompanied by Richard Strauss' Thus Spoke Zarathustra, to the bone being tossed into the air by the ape. It has become such a huge phenomenon that even today TV series, movies, parodies and comics continue to spoof it. It is impossible to hear The Blue Danube without associating it to Kubrick's masterpiece. And that is what it is, in every sense of the word a masterpiece. Nothing is half-baked or average about 2001 - it is a work of enormous attention to detail and love for the art of movie-making itself. Although Kubrick continued to direct amazing movies like The Shining, A Clockwork Orange and Full Metal Jacket (which were all far more accessible movies) after 2001, he couldn't top this his crowning achievement.It's easy to see how viewers may be put off by 2001 - it doesn't follow the usual movie formula where the plot comes to a conclusion at the end. In fact, neither before nor after 2001 has a movie been made the same way. Plot line and characters are more or less redundant in this film It's all in the images and music, and what it all means. I won't go into the point of 2001 since I haven't read the book and I think it is up to each viewer to decide for himself what it all means.The movie jumps from the very dawn of man's use of weapons to a time when space is heavily trafficked, and continues to show us the fate of some unlucky astronauts at the hands of a super-intelligent computer called HAL-9000. I won't spoil what happens in the end but I will say that if you could see it coming, you must be some kind of super genius; as far as I'm concerned it is the single least predictable ending for a movie, ever.Kubrick is the only director that I know of who has portrayed space in the most realistic way possible vast, endless, dark, empty, and soundless. It's admirable that a director goes out of his way to make sure no sounds are heard in space, but rather than let this make the movie dreary and dull, Kubrick uses this to his advantage the chilling silence of some scenes actually help build up the atmosphere in a way that no movie has done before. Some scenes are outright scary, working at an almost subconscious level. Kubrick has always been a master of creating moods and emotions with the viewer, and 2001 is the prime example of this The climactic scene in the bathroom is unbelievably frightening, and Kubrick creates a sense of dread purely without monsters, murderers or loud music. It's amazing.The movie is highly meditative and definitely not the one to watch if you want a loud, action-packed Star Wars-type adventure. The long periods of near-complete silence, the low-key dialogue, HAL's monotonous voice (a stroke of genius) and the scattered pieces of classical music set you in a state of complete relaxation and makes you think. I realize this is highly personal and will not work for all viewers. The special effects are pitch-perfect, still as good today as they were almost 40 years ago. While the digital effects of the Star Wars prequels will be outdated in 10 years, 2001 will continue to stun people with its shockingly realistic and believable effects. Although I would have preferred Kubrick to win the Best Director Oscar for this (as well as many of his other films), the Best Effects award is completely deserved. 2001 still beats many of today's movies in terms of best effects.If you've grown tired of mediocre movies, give 2001 another chance.

If you think Vanilla Sky is simply a re-make, you could not be more wrong. There is tremendous depth in this film visually, musically, and emotionally.Visually, because the film is soft and delicate at times (early scenes with Sofia) and at other times powerful and intense (Times Square, post-climactic scenes).The music and sounds tie into this movie so perfectly. Without the music, the story is only half told. Nancy Wilson created an emotional, yet eclectic, score for the film which could not be more suitable for such a dream-like theme (although never released, I was able to get my hands on the original score for about $60. If you look hard, you may be able to find a copy yourself). Crowe's other musical selections, such as The Beach Boys, Josh Rouse, Spiritualized, Sigur Ros, the Monkees, etcetera etcetera, are also perfect fits for the film (Crowe has an ear for great music).More importantly, the emotional themes in this film (i.e. love, sadness, regret) are very powerful, and are amplified tenfold by the visual and musical experience, as well as the ingenious dialogue; I admit, the elevator scene brings tears to my eyes time and time again.The best part of this film however (as if it could get any better) is that it is so intelligently crafted such that each time you see the film, you will catch something new--so watch closely, and be prepared to think! Sure, a theme becomes obvious after the first or second watch, but there is always more to the story than you think.This is easily Cameron Crowe's best work, and altogether a work of brilliance. Much of my film-making and musical inspiration comes from this work alone. It has honestly touched my life, as true art has a tendency of doing. It continually surprises me that there are many people that cannot appreciate this film for what it is (I guess to understand true art is an art itself).Bottom line Vanilla Sky is in a league of its own.

There is tremendous depth in this film visually, musically, and emotionally.Visually, because the film is soft and delicate at times (early scenes with Sofia) and at other times powerful and intense (Times Square, post-climactic scenes).The music and sounds tie into this movie so perfectly. Without the music, the story is only half told. Nancy Wilson created an emotional, yet eclectic, score for the film which could not be more suitable for such a dream-like theme (although never released, I was able to get my hands on the original score for about $60. If you look hard, you may be able to find a copy yourself). Crowe's other musical selections, such as The Beach Boys, Josh Rouse, Spiritualized, Sigur Ros, the Monkees, etcetera etcetera, are also perfect fits for the film (Crowe has an ear for great music).More importantly, the emotional themes in this film (i.e. love, sadness, regret) are very powerful, and are amplified tenfold by the visual and musical experience, as well as the ingenious dialogue; I admit, the elevator scene brings tears to my eyes time and time again.The best part of this film however (as if it could get any better) is that it is so intelligently crafted such that each time you see the film, you will catch something new--so watch closely, and be prepared to think! Sure, a theme becomes obvious after the first or second watch, but there is always more to the story than you think.This is easily Cameron Crowe's best work, and altogether a work of brilliance. Much of my film-making and musical inspiration comes from this work alone. It has honestly touched my life, as true art has a tendency of doing.

The Andy Griffith Show, and Matlock began almost 50 years ago, and 20 years ago, respectively - and both are among the most prevalent re-runs on cable and local television. Sometime the curmudgeon, Matlock was always the good guy, capable, thoughtful, and charitable when required (for those unfairly accused, but unable to afford his substantial retainer). Sheriff Andy Taylor was the ideal of the good man, good friend and good citizen - nice and honest to a fault, yet (fairly) firm and tough if need be. In other roles, Griffith has sometimes played nasty types, as effectively as those with his usual nice guy, aw shucks persona. In watching A Face in the Crowd, one should note that the next picture he made was No Time for Sergeants, with a character as good, friendly, selfless and innocent as this movie's Lonesome Rhodes presents the total opposite. (Of course, he had a few years prior performed the ...Sergeants role on-stage and in a t.v. production.) As a start, it is difficult to imagine an offering directed by Elia Kazan with writing by Budd Schulberg to be anything but great. Lonesome Rhodes is the country-boy equivalent of the equally ego-maniacal, selfish, malevolent and cruel Sammy Glick, the young Jewish, urbane lead character from Schulberg's What Makes Sammy Run? Although opposites in terms of heritage, Lonesome and Sammy are eerily unfeeling, almost sociopath kinsmen underneath. This film's other lead characters, portrayed by Patricia Neal, Anthony Franciosa, Walter Matthau and Lee Remick, are excellent - and both their performances and these characters ring true. A fascinating sidelight aspect while watching the film, is noting the namby-pamby, milk toast character played by Matthau, so different from his lovable wise guy persona which was his trademark; however, this is what the characterization called for, and he does it well. A young Rip Torn is interesting to see in a scene at the film's end. Of particular note in the supporting roles are Rod Brasfield as Lonesome's clueless friend, Beanie; and Senator Fuller, as portrayed by Marshall Neilan. Griffith is absolutely engrossing to watch as his character grows in fame and power, and he relishes every moment of it, expanding his web of cruelty beyond what one would expect of even such a totally self-serving individual. Any film with this type of media superstar, beloved on air and on camera, but wickedly different in reality, is inevitably compared with Arthur Godfrey, the radio and t.v. icon of the 1940's and '50's. It has also been reported that, additionally, Schulberg may also have based some aspects of Lonesome on Will Rogers. His country-boy persona certainly was more like Rogers' than Godfrey's, albeit the latter being thoroughly folksy. Will Rogers is much-beloved everywhere - but no more than in the northeastern part of Oklahoma, his home area. This reverence is even greater due to his early, untimely death in the plane crash, at a point where his continued presence was anticipated for many more years. But while Rogers is still the epitome of the aw shucks yet erudite personality, we must remember that he starred in several movies, and was the best polo player in Hollywood, when the sport was perhaps more popular there and in comparable circles than today. The urbane lifestyle of Hollywood presented no obstacles for him, and he was apparently completely at-home in this locale, very different from his roots. But however much Schulberg took Lonesome Rhodes from actual personalities - and however much from his own talented, fertile imagination - this character and Andy Griffith's marvelous performance are classic. This presentation is memorable for these, per se; and also for the effective way it depicts the feel and character of the 1950's era.

Not much I can add - I agree, but I visualize a much greater film after reading the extras. Stay away from them until you've watched the movie.I LOVED this movie. The disaster is, it had to be filmed on a shoe-string budget. All of the actors-actresses gave strong performances, but better talent could have been found. Once you discover the secret, you'll understand my criticisms, as The Oldest Drag-Queen in Captivity.Very little is said about this plot we go in blind, if we do not know about The Irish Republican Army, made-up of fanatics similar to Al Qaida.Jody (Forest Whitaker) is a British soldier, but that's all we find-out about him. He is captured as a prisoner by the IRA. For the second half of the movie, it needs a much prettier man. Maybe the budget could not afford a handsomer actor. Whitaker is very good in his short role, and apparently he didn't object to being associated with this shocker.Fergus (Jimmy, Stephen Rea) was much too old for this role - look at the virile soldiers he's working for. His only purpose is to be an executioner for Jody, but develops a liking to him. He actually could have been a pawn for revenge, Jody knowing he was going to die. He made Fergus promise to look-up his lady-friend in London. Rea portrayed his role with too much guilt and\/or sympathy, or sexual denial. Although good, his acting could have been stronger.Dil (Jaye Davidson, an unknown, therefore cheap) is Jody's lady-friend. There is a secret about her. I was surprised that few viewers saw the secret immediately - distinctly apparent to me. That character was described by Kubric to be impossible to cast - I know dozens who could have played the role, and would have been more convincing. In a gaybar like The Metro, everyone knows everything about everyone. Jody's being kidnapped should have been no surprise; there were headlines; it's my opinion Dil was on a vendetta to find her lover's killers.Jude (Miranda Richardson) is the brilliant femme-fatale for the IRA - very clever girl. Apparently the IRA knew more about Jody than we are told. Jude shows-up at every location Jody would have been in. Dil would have been no mystery to Jude - she even knew where she lived. ....a little heavy on the powder. Dave was Dil's abusive boyfriend. Jude and the IRA-soldiers do-away with him (although we are not told of this) and too late Jimmy realizes the IRA-Dave has been stalking him, tightening the grip for more executions.After the secret is revealed to Jimmy, the plot is too convoluted to write about without being excessive. Just pay attention. Fergus-Jimmy misses the next execution, and Jude knows exactly where to find him - at Dils pad. In she stomps with weapons, but Dil turns-out to be a better shot. This provides the idea Dil was hip, all along. Dil murders Jude without remorse, saying she was there. Poor Jimmy is so protective of Dil, he does the time for her.The Crying Game was a very popular song, and gives the movie its name. Dil lipsyncs it. All of the music does its job well. Cinematography is great. The disaster is, filming it bankrupted its producers; Miramax backs-off financing it until it sees the finished product, then realizes it's going to be a huge success. It distributes it, raking-in the cash.Dil-with-the-secret is the central role of this movie - the producers didn't visit enough gay bars to find a softer-looking person to play the role. Had I known they were searching, I'd have sent them a dozen, ultimately more beautiful and talented. One user wrote no one is giving-away the secret. That's how I learned about it, in a review about another movie. EVERYONE gives-away the secret. For our society, it should not be that shocking - it's all around us. If you don't see it, you aren't looking.There should definitely be a re-make of this film. The story is too beautiful to be left as it is. After all of these caustic comments, I LOVED THIS MOVIE. I rate it at 20. Watch it to come out of The Dark Ages - do so without preconceptions. Bravo! to Neil Jordan; he knew exactly what he wanted to film, and certainly deserved his Oscar. It should be shown to every high-schooler - they know about it, anyway. Adults have no excuse for not seeing this movie.Congratulations to everyone who had a part of bringing it to the screen - YOU will come away either pro or con - watch it twice and really understand it.

Not much I can add - I agree, but I visualize a much greater film after reading the extras. Stay away from them until you've watched the movie.I LOVED this movie. The disaster is, it had to be filmed on a shoe-string budget. All of the actors-actresses gave strong performances, but better talent could have been found. Once you discover the secret, you'll understand my criticisms, as The Oldest Drag-Queen in Captivity.Very little is said about this plot we go in blind, if we do not know about The Irish Republican Army, made-up of fanatics similar to Al Qaida.Jody (Forest Whitaker) is a British soldier, but that's all we find-out about him. He is captured as a prisoner by the IRA. For the second half of the movie, it needs a much prettier man. Maybe the budget could not afford a handsomer actor. Whitaker is very good in his short role, and apparently he didn't object to being associated with this shocker.Fergus (Jimmy, Stephen Rea) was much too old for this role - look at the virile soldiers he's working for. His only purpose is to be an executioner for Jody, but develops a liking to him. He actually could have been a pawn for revenge, Jody knowing he was going to die. He made Fergus promise to look-up his lady-friend in London. Rea portrayed his role with too much guilt and\/or sympathy, or sexual denial. Although good, his acting could have been stronger.Dil (Jaye Davidson, an unknown, therefore cheap) is Jody's lady-friend. There is a secret about her. I was surprised that few viewers saw the secret immediately - distinctly apparent to me. That character was described by Kubric to be impossible to cast - I know dozens who could have played the role, and would have been more convincing. In a gaybar like The Metro, everyone knows everything about everyone. Jody's being kidnapped should have been no surprise; there were headlines; it's my opinion Dil was on a vendetta to find her lover's killers.Jude (Miranda Richardson) is the brilliant femme-fatale for the IRA - very clever girl. Apparently the IRA knew more about Jody than we are told. Jude shows-up at every location Jody would have been in. Dil would have been no mystery to Jude - she even knew where she lived. ....a little heavy on the powder. Dave was Dil's abusive boyfriend. Jude and the IRA-soldiers do-away with him (although we are not told of this) and too late Jimmy realizes the IRA-Dave has been stalking him, tightening the grip for more executions.After the secret is revealed to Jimmy, the plot is too convoluted to write about without being excessive. Just pay attention. Fergus-Jimmy misses the next execution, and Jude knows exactly where to find him - at Dils pad. In she stomps with weapons, but Dil turns-out to be a better shot. This provides the idea Dil was hip, all along. Dil murders Jude without remorse, saying she was there.

As it's a very early Hitchcock film, I had very low expectations for it, but was pleasantly surprised to find that the suspense and especially the mystery elements are much better than many of his later films. If the film hadn't been silent and if many (if not all) of the existing prints hadn't been in such poor shape, this would undoubtedly be a more widely known film. By the way, the DVD box says it was THE first film by Hitchcock, I noticed when consulting IMDb that it is NOT. Also, towards the end of the film, for all you people who love to spot the director in his cameos, it MIGHT be Hitchcock in front and center in the crowd scene only if he put on muttonchops and hair. It DOES look like him, but in later films he always looked like himself--bald and ordinary.As for the movie, it's about a Jack the Ripper-type assassin that is targeting fair-haired ladies. When a mysterious lodger arrives at a boarding house, slowly people begin to suspect him of the killings. How the writers and director manipulated this to move the audience is brilliant and the film's conclusion is not telegraphed but exciting and fulfilling. A wonderful but overlooked film.By the way, if you want to see this film or its sound remake (The Phantom Fiend), you can download them for free at archive.org--you can just follow the links on IMDb.

Unlike other noir classics such as Public Enemy, Detour, and The Postman Always Rings Twice, the characters of DI are not half-forgotten lowlifes crawling in the gutter of society. Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck are upright respectable people. MacMurray is an insurance agent, and Stanwyck, who is married to a rich businessman, lives among the Los Angeles upper-crust. I can't remember if her house is supposed to be in Beverly Hills, but it is in one of the more exclusive areas of LA.These two characters do not engage in their illicit activities for reasons of pure survival as in Postman or Detour. Their motivation is far more complex and terrifying. They are bored with their present situations. MacMurray realizes that as an insurance agent, he is on a permanent plateau financially. He will probably never exceed what money he has already made. Stanwyck, despite being the wife of a wealthy man, finds her life dull, without excitement, without sex. MacMurray wants greater financial power. She wants greater sexual power and freedom. When the two meet, they sense a strange chemistry in which each can gain something from the other. MacMurray can gain wealth and higher standing from Stanwyck. Stanwyck can gain freedom with the help of MacMurray. And the means to these ends is an insurance policy. Stanwyck holds the policy but MacMurray understands certain implications about the policy that is not even known to Stanwyck. From this very simple seed, an insurance agent, his client, and an insurance policy, grows crime, betrayal, and murder. And yet these characters are people you might have met in town in 1944. Typical upstanding citizens. And yet what lurks inside them seems at first hideous and evil. And yet, strangely familiar... The characters of DI represent the darker sides that we all have within us. Every hetero male has moments when he might covet the beautiful wife of a wealthy neighbor or acquaintance and wished for a moment that he could take the other man's place. And isn't there something deep inside some hetero married females who wish they could extract themselves from their marriage without losing their wealth? Certainly, the actions that lead to the undoing of MacMurray and Stanwyck may be grotesque on the surface. But deeper inside, the motivations behind their behavior represent something that is inside many of us. We identify with these characters while the morale of society says we should not.
