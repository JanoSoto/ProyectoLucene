Like its main character, it takes on many different identities and seems like quite the epic journey to self-realization. Sometimes it's an action flick. Other times it's a thriller. Maybe even a light comedy, and it's all thrown into a philosophical masterpiece. Fight Club tells the story of the narrator (Edward Norton) whose life is in turmoil due to an extreme case of insomnia. He turns to self-help groups, which cures his insomnia because he sees people who are worse than him. The character is never given a name because he cannot attain a true identity. He is lost within the world as another soul with nothing to live for. The director (David Fincher) injects a lot of comedic moments throughout the film that work quite well. It is in fact a dark comedy, for example when they joke about a woman with cancer. Except, even with this subject matter, you find yourself laughing at what she and the narrator says. In turn, you feel disgusted with yourself and find yourself staring eye to eye with Edward Norton's character. He too is disgusted with his entire life and is stuck in this endless cycle. He then meets Tyler Durden, played by Brad Pitt, who seems to know exactly who he is inside. He is everything that people are not, specifically the narrator. I found myself wanting to be Tyler Durden mainly because of the way he handles himself. Brad Pitt's performance is wonderfully captivating as he teeters on becoming a psycho and yet you want to join in with that madness.They both decide to start a fight club in which people fight with one another in order to feel something again in their numbing worlds. The film is definitely geared towards the younger audience, but then again if you dislike the world at points of your life, you can relate. The only real flaw within the film is it gets a little off track. It delves into the excessive and overdone specifically with the space monkey scenes, but is able to get on again after a while. By the end of the film, the viewer is exhausted as the narrator aimlessly tries to find Tyler again after he leaves him. Although, he doesn't really need to find him ever again. I could tell you why, but that would be breaking the rules of Fight Club. The film successfully uses this plot twist to further its themes, but also add another dimension to the story for the audience.The film is able to work on many levels due to the amount of relating the audience can do with their own life. This is a story about how society is one big commercial. They are rebelling, specifically Edward Norton's character, towards that feeling and creating a new one by feeling a fist against their cheekbone. They are all so infuriated that by the end of the film, they watch the credit card buildings burn down to the ground. But none of them are scared, they know who they are and that's all that matters. The film touches on so many different subjects and tries to cover every reach of the human emotion. This is its brilliance and pitfall. It overreaches at some points, but grabs hold of something much greater at others. The film makes the viewer think on a grand scale and gives them questions. I still haven't been able to shake it off even after ten viewings. By the end of the film you won't be asking yourself what is Fight Club, but who am I?

François Truffaut&#x97;considered the grandfather of the French cinema movement la nouvelle vague&#x97;once again looks to his childhood. But the result is less nostalgic and much more lyrical and moody than 400 Blows, about a naughty Parisian school boy and the system that represses his childish impulses.The film is set in bohemian France just before the breakout of the Great War. Two men meet by accident, and become best friends. As the title of the movie suggests, Jules (a sandy-haired German) and Jim (a dark-haired Frenchman) are inseparable they box each other à la française and go to cramped corner cafés the likes of which are sought-after in Paris. For students of French literature, the plot resembles the story of Pierre et Jean, the two brothers of a petite bourgeoise family who get into trouble when a woman enters their lives. Enter Catherine (once again, by accident). She runs into the two as they walk down a street late one night. Jules becomes infatuated with her almost at once. He loves in particular her calm visage (which reminds him of an ancient stone sculpture he found on an island excursion with Jim after seeing a slideshow).Catherine, it turns out, is more of an adventurous bohemian than Jules or Jim. In one lovely scene, the trio arrive at the end of an overpass. Catherine challenges them to a race dressed as a boy, and takes off before Jim has given the commands. The course à pied evokes not so much frivolity, but a certain carefree, bohemian demeanor that soon thereafter went into hibernation in capitals across Europe. The expansive camera work does not seem cramped despite the claustrophobic space, and demonstrates the skill, even ingenuity, of New Wave directors such as Truffaut. But Catherine tires of Paris, and desires to take an overnight trip to Provence.To achieve historic authenticity (whatever that may be), Truffaut employed stock footage of Paris from that period. Although grainy (though much cleaned up and improved by the Criterion remastering), the clips do almost serve as sketches of inspiration for Truffaut. Moreover, one can almost perceive Truffaut shaking his head over the Dark Ages of film-making. But they do provide context (at the expense of seeming somewhat out of place and jarring).Other elements work more cohesively. The sound&#x97;per the New Wave standard of excellence&#x97;is first-rate. The fanfare is sweeping and doesn't upstage either the acting or camera work.But Catherine is the more complicated and troubled of the characters. One night out, reminiscent of their first meeting, Jules goes off and quotes an uncouth Baudelaire verse, which upsets Catherine. Distraught and hopeless, she tosses herself into the Seine. Her fedora floats away, but Jules and Jim manage to pull her from the water. Death is a constant specter in this film, and her attempt (if not attention-getting act) marks an evolution in the mood of the film.Jules and Jim spend much of the time in the film together, but when the First World War breaks out, they become soldiers in opposing armies. Jules writes a letter to Catherine (who has since become his wife) that he worries constantly that he will kill his friend Jim. This sentiment only underscores the psychological trauma of the lost generation. He writes more letters home. Eventually, Jules is positioned on the Eastern Front, where the fighting is worse and the weather colder, but he finds new hope in knowing that he won't inadvertently shoot Jim. Truffaut dabbles in the stock footage again here. This time, it is excellent&#x97;and serves a useful purpose i.e., keeping the film budget low by eliminating battle scenes. The shots are gritty, and more importantly non-fictive.The war ends, and both Jules and Jim count themselves among the survivors. Jules survived the war, but he isn't the same. He has relocated the family to the bucolic foothills of Austria. No longer youthful and energetic, he has discovered a new passion tending his garden. When Jim visits, the two seem older, more rooted. Catherine is in the inscrutable words of Jim less grasshopper, more ant. She makes less music, and she works more to keep the household intact and functioning. Jules and Catherine have had a baby, a stark change from their pre-war days. Their daughter is a larger theme she is joy and hope for the future, but also a tie-down, who is conspicuously absent in the last act.Though it is called Jules and Jim, the film is really about the whims and emotional states of its heroine Catherine. Catherine feels isolated living in Germany. She longs for a different life&#x97;her former one in France. She is not entirely domesticated, but she has clearly lost some of her youthful air. She is married to Jules, but toward the end she professes her love for Jim. This ménange à trois is a central element of the film. Only when the three are united does some sort harmony and balance dominate. But Catherine is the pivot of this trio, and its soul.My only gripe with the film is its length. It could be ten, maybe fifteen minutes slimmer. But when a gifted director like Truffaut is telling the story, perhaps too long is never enough.

The formula is exactly the same (and man I really mean exactly), although it follows all of the usual rules of an action sequel, which state that it must have a much bigger budget (Axel still does his police work by his own rules, only this time he uses precinct money to drive around in a Ferrari), more deaths, faster and funnier jokes (it clearly shoots for this one, anyway&#x85;), and at least one more 6-foot platinum blonde. Let's take a little trip, shall we? Beverly Hills Cop 2 was released in May of 1987, and so came just after things like Top Gun, Police Academy 3, The Color of Money, To Live and Die in L.A. (which was sort of an anti-buddy cop movie with a mean streak that is clearly reflected in Cop 2), Eddie Murphy's own The Golden Child, and the original Lethal Weapon, which was released just a few months earlier and may have been sharing theaters with it. Needless to say, there was no shortage of police movies and whatnot, and no time is wasted in attempting to stand out from the crowd.The movie starts with a violent robbery pulled off in broad daylight by a highly organized group of criminals headed by the statuesque Bridgette Nielsen, who plays the curiously named Karla Fry. She's involved with a ruthless organized crime syndicate that is running firearms to Central America, and when police chief Bogomil is gunned down, Foley decides he's going to head on back to southern California to solve the case himself again. Everyone is friends now after the events of the first movie. Taggart and Rosewood are no longer spying on Axel but have all become good friends, as they have with Bogomil, who sided with them against the Commissioner or Chief or Mayor or whatever at the end of the last movie. Unfortunately, the new police chief is a total jerkoff and has been firing everyone in sight and replacing them with all of his own people, so once again Taggart and Rosewood and Foley are forced to go against direct orders in order to do what needs to be done.The movie has been almost unanimously slammed by critics, and I would certainly hesitate to say that it's as bad as all that. In more recent years I have not always been the biggest fans of people like Jerry Bruckeimer (the mega-producer who we have to thank for such highly polished cheesefests as Armageddon and Gone in 60 Seconds and Pearl Harbor, not that he hasn't had his better movies), but if you are just looking for a fun popcorn action flick, you could certainly do worse than this one.If nothing else, it was great fun picking out the hilarious 80s pop culture references, some of which were light-hearted jabs at the competition, such as the posters for First Blood Part II and Rambo in Rosewood's stress-free apartment, and maybe my favorite, Bridgette Nielsen's (Stallone's wife at the time) earrings, which were these bizarre little metallic arrows that made her look like a Klingon. It's true that some of the jokes and situations are a little too unoriginal, even only in the first sequel, such as Foley's remarkable ability to come up with crazy stories on the spot (although the best one is where he pretends to be a gay prostitute to get into a ritzy club and harass the bad guy) and his loud-mouthed streams profanity. But again, not necessarily something that I would criticize the movie for just for being there. It gets a little cheesy at times though, like when he gets into the bad guys' office by pretending to be a delivery boy delivering highly unstable plutonium capsules in - get this - a brown paper bag, but overall it stays in the same vein as the original and may even be better in a lot of ways.

She's involved with a ruthless organized crime syndicate that is running firearms to Central America, and when police chief Bogomil is gunned down, Foley decides he's going to head on back to southern California to solve the case himself again. Everyone is friends now after the events of the first movie. Taggart and Rosewood are no longer spying on Axel but have all become good friends, as they have with Bogomil, who sided with them against the Commissioner or Chief or Mayor or whatever at the end of the last movie. Unfortunately, the new police chief is a total jerkoff and has been firing everyone in sight and replacing them with all of his own people, so once again Taggart and Rosewood and Foley are forced to go against direct orders in order to do what needs to be done.The movie has been almost unanimously slammed by critics, and I would certainly hesitate to say that it's as bad as all that. In more recent years I have not always been the biggest fans of people like Jerry Bruckeimer (the mega-producer who we have to thank for such highly polished cheesefests as Armageddon and Gone in 60 Seconds and Pearl Harbor, not that he hasn't had his better movies), but if you are just looking for a fun popcorn action flick, you could certainly do worse than this one.If nothing else, it was great fun picking out the hilarious 80s pop culture references, some of which were light-hearted jabs at the competition, such as the posters for First Blood Part II and Rambo in Rosewood's stress-free apartment, and maybe my favorite, Bridgette Nielsen's (Stallone's wife at the time) earrings, which were these bizarre little metallic arrows that made her look like a Klingon. It's true that some of the jokes and situations are a little too unoriginal, even only in the first sequel, such as Foley's remarkable ability to come up with crazy stories on the spot (although the best one is where he pretends to be a gay prostitute to get into a ritzy club and harass the bad guy) and his loud-mouthed streams profanity. But again, not necessarily something that I would criticize the movie for just for being there. It gets a little cheesy at times though, like when he gets into the bad guys' office by pretending to be a delivery boy delivering highly unstable plutonium capsules in - get this - a brown paper bag, but overall it stays in the same vein as the original and may even be better in a lot of ways.

The formula is exactly the same (and man I really mean exactly), although it follows all of the usual rules of an action sequel, which state that it must have a much bigger budget (Axel still does his police work by his own rules, only this time he uses precinct money to drive around in a Ferrari), more deaths, faster and funnier jokes (it clearly shoots for this one, anyway&#x85;), and at least one more 6-foot platinum blonde. Let's take a little trip, shall we? Beverly Hills Cop 2 was released in May of 1987, and so came just after things like Top Gun, Police Academy 3, The Color of Money, To Live and Die in L.A.

If we get to see the extended cut, we can see that the ship has further deteriorated at least on the outside, one of the huge U structures seems to have fallen down.And so this is the film which gave James Cameron his acid test - And he had to re-visualise the universe that Ridley Scott created.But he did not totally revamp that future imperfect... He added to it. He shows us the Company - The Weyland\/Yutani company which went unnamed in the first film. He gives us a look into the Corporate which drives this future and their motivations.And according to Cameron, that future is just as bleak as our present, including corporate criminals as portrayed by Paul Reiser and Military Meatheads portrayed by William Hope, Bill Paxton, Jeanette Goldstein and Cameron's own imported Michael Biehn. Cameron gives us a look at various personality types and how they would act in the future... Which is to say that there is not that much difference.After viewing some of the Bonus features, and a very long documentary which was made alongside the original filming of this epic, it is amazing, how Cameron could do so much, and build a universe so big in the limited space he had to work with. Amazingly, the budget for this hyper epic was a mere 25 Million, which would barely pay for Pre-vis in any modern epic.The first time I saw the Theatrical Aliens I was impressed by the hugeness of the production, the sets seemed titanic. This was just Cameron, who was very clever with the way he filmed scenes on the alien planet LV426. It is difficult to determine what set pieces are actually miniatures, and which are full sized. The Troop Transport was a beautiful redressing of an airplane tug.Regardless of style difference between Ridley Scott and Cameron, this film is a seamless continuation of the story of Leftenant Ripley. Cameron uses all the resources at his command to tell this story, and his library of tricks which he learned by working for veteran filmmaker Roger Corman The amount of visual trickery done by Cameron which fakes us into believing that LV426 is a real planet is astounding.The Aliens which are shown in this film, are a slightly different colour that the Scott's Geiger-made Alien.. And they do not have the shiny domed heads, which gave the Alien it's frightening, metallic aspect. Instead, they had Bone ridges which were probably cheaper to make. The fact that there are only maybe 5 or 6 actual alien suits is clouded under the impression that there are hundreds of these beasts.There is nothing that needs to be added, or subtracted from this story, and the extended cut of the film is most satisfactory, bringing elements back in which ought not to have been cut, but probably were for time considerations The initial scene where Newt's parents visit the Alien Shipwreck and get facehugged - Which includes a short look at the life in the colony, the children, and even the Weyland-Yutani logo... Which gives us the name of the company for the first time, except that this was not shown until the early 90s when the laserdisk of the extended cut was released. This scene was a critical piece of exposition, however, even when cut, the story survives brilliantly.But in order to put this film on an equal bearing with the original Alien, Cameron showed us that which was laying the eggs The Alien QUEEN. When I first saw it, I just assumed it was Geiger's work... But to my amazement, this creature was wholly designed by James Cameron- And he mimics Geiger's work so well, you just cannot tell.The idea of the Queen gives us the shock value which the original film had And when we first see this thing, we are agape. When I view the DVD, I must and do, rewind the scene and watch it again and again- Because that first impression is fantastic.This film is one of the jewels of the 20th century, and when you consider that the Universe that was shown to us was wholly created by using practical effects, we wonder why this kind of film-making cannot be done anymore. We assume that this kind of practical film-making cannot be done due to cost, but that is not the case This kind of film-making cannot be accomplished in these days because we lack one important thing A Filmmaker of James Cameron's Caliber and ingenuity.
