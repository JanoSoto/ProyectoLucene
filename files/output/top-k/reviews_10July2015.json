The writing in romantic comedies is always awful. Yes, the pirates were silly; please, The Blue Lagoon did not even have a script; the two characters were so endearing nobody noticed. Heche goes through this movie like a piece of heavy machinery. That shrill, screeching, misandrist act gets old very, very fast. Yes, just because she is a career woman does not mean she has to be that shrill and pushy. Also, by the way, she has always been a terrible actress. Did you find her overacting and hyper gesticulations to distract you from her lack of talent convincing? When all is said and done, imagine Ford's hot girlfriend in the role instead of Heche? The movie would have been so much better. The woman is always annoying; always lecturing, correcting then yelling and overacting badly. It is worth watching once for Ford's performance in a very difficult role. No supporting cast, out there all alone with bad acting Anne Heche, trying to hold the movie up. Also, the scenery is worth seeing; it has some of the best photography I had seen in a long time. You just need to be honest with yourself about how much of Anne Heche you can take; I watch it occasionally but I would never buy it. She just is too annoying; yes, she had to land the plane, guess whose idea that was? Yes, superwoman saves the day; you can always tell which parts of the script were her ideas.

When you watch the movie listen to her delivery, her lines would have worked with another, less strident, talented actress. She is the anchor that sank this movie. She also did considerable damage to The Juror. True, it was DOA when released but she really helped wreck it. If you can stomach her, I can recommend the movie. Ford evokes such sympathy when you watch it. You can see on his face, his worry that he made a terrible mistake. Poor guy, a great performance destroyed and rarely seen all due to dreadful casting.

Some aspects of the film I love, while others I think are just plain bad. Before I get into the negatives and positives, let me just say that I still enjoy Batman Returns quite a bit, and I think for the first hour and fifteen minutes, it was a worthy successor to the original Batman movie in 1989. So, the negatives. Tim Burton's directing here is not good. I understand he likes doing weird stuff, and that was prevalent in the original Batman movie more or less. This one... goes a little too crazy. I like the dark and ominous tone this movie sets up, but unfortunately at times it just throws that out the window to have a scene that's just like... what? At one point in the movie Penguin puts a little control device on the Batmobile that allows him to control it, instead of Batman. Penguin controls it by driving a recreation of the bat-mobile, that looks like it's a kid's ride at a carnival. And throughout the scene Penguin has a TV screen that he uses to taunt Batman with, while making some truly horrible jokes. Yeah, it gets that crazy. And another thing, does anyone else notice just how many stretches there are where a central character disappears completely. Batman's in maybe thirty to forty minutes of the movie (okay, maybe that's an exaggeration, but c'mon! It's called Batman Returns, not Batman shows up in a few scenes here and there). Catwoman disappears for a good twenty minutes towards the end of the film, and then just shows up at the end without any explanation. It's just...bizarre. Too many scenes that seem as though they're supposed to be taken seriously just come off as laughable, such as Penguin shooting his rebellious henchman who just stands there stupidly, or the police officers who open fire on the Penguin on sight, y'know, the former mayoral candidate. Then there's the cast, and this is where the movie really shines. Christopher Walken is delightfully over the top as Max Shreck, and is a joy to watch throughout the film, as he tosses lots of great dialogue around. 'Next time I'll push her out a higher window!' he remarks, after discovering Selena Kyle is still alive. Michael Keaton is still a great, if underused Batman, and then there's Michelle Pfeiffer of course, who is just a great Catwoman. Her and Keaton had some great chemistry together in this movie, and the scenes between them were easily the best things in the movie. Michael Gough is great as the dignified Alfred, and he and Keaton share some good scenes. And then... there's Danny Devito as the Penguin, who I just... I don't know why, but I just did not like him. He was kind of funny for a while, and even managed to be fairly sympathetic, but later on he just got too goofy, and he really doesn't do all that much, despite being featured so strongly. He was basically just a figure head for Shreck. Later on he hatches his own schemes, but the fact that he straps rockets to the backs of hundreds of penguins and sends them out controlled by radio waves to destroy Gotham doesn't help his case much. There are some good action scenes though, such as the fights between Batman and Catwoman, not to mention the numerous times the circus gang shows up and Batman has to fight them, such as the acrobats who he gets into some pretty fun martial arts duels with. On a side note, Batman killing people is something that kind of irks me, and I kind of like. Change is good, and I like that there's some difference to this than the Nolan movies in regards to themes, but seeing Batman killing people is just...weird. In the end, I really liked the first chunk of this movie, and absolutely loved Keaton, Pfeiffer, and Walken in their roles, but I really didn't like the end, the directing, or Devito. However, it was still entertaining, so I would recommend watching this movie if you haven't already.

It isn't awesome by any stretch of the imagination and I'll go into that later on but this does at least set a bench mark in film, one that started one of the biggest film franchises of all time.The movie is a nice mix between a kind of light and lovely kind of thing, but then dark and oddly scary in certain ways. The movie is for the most part heart-warming and gives you a beautiful sense of I'm there kind of feeling and one which instantly connects you with the characters. The plot can have it's more terrifying moments and especially maybe for the young viewers, a certain scene including the Forbidden Forest comes to mind on that one. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are not great as our main heroes but they're not bad either actually, they don't really know how to act just yet but they still regain that nice sweet feeling about them which is all that counts here. The whole cast is a plethora of greats, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Richard Harris and many others contribute to the great cast who just make this film really what it is and make it all importantly, fun.It's possible as they say, that Christopher Columbus the director stuck too close to the books here and really should have deviated from the scenes which well, only work in the book. I applaud him for staying true but I have to say the film is over long and stuffed full of long periods where very little happens and that can at times make this seem slightly dull. I do like Columbus here though, I think he directs well and Steve Kloves adapts the screenplay pretty well too, yet again good all round.Now one thing that may not be most remembered but for me should are the special effects which for the day are really great and make this so much more exciting at times. Certain scenes just wouldn't work without them being good and the team behind it seem to create a visually good looking film too. Staying on the way this looks the sets are magnificent and truly incredibly done, on such a large scale it is difficult but they pull it off and first time as well. I felt this film is like an epic that is both for adults and kids and that is for me what sets this apart from other such movies in the fantasy genre. It shouldn't leave anyone feeling negative afterwards and really makes you kind happy in a way that leaves you positive about the whole movie and is another reason this is so memorable. It's hard to not fall in love with the Harry Potter world, the film not so much but the thing it is set in, very much so.Overall a good movie and also one that kick-starts a huge franchise of films that are so remembered and will be for me, in years to come. It's the kind of movie that isn't great but is still a classic in senses, so many people around the world can quote it and words and phrases from this movie continue to be used in everyday speech, just magically wonderful.

Patrick Swayze is a major player and I totally buy what he's selling as a badass bouncer. He may not be the biggest, but he's known to rip a throat out or two. It's a real wonder Road House didn't receive 7, 8 Academy Awards because it sure as hell deserved them. Road House really is good stuff and it's so clearly the best bar brawling movie around. Patrick looks really good with no shirt on. Kelly Lynch keeps things interesting. Kelly looks really good with no shirt on and no pants even better.

This is such an effective way to increase curiosity and suspense. We see, slowly, more and more until the unmasking when only Arnie is left. The pacing is the star of this movie along with the photography. The jungle is used so you never know when it is going to pop out on you. The movie starts and simply never stops. After the discovery of Hopper's team, it rushes into the hostage rescue which is done very well. If you notice, the director kills off the cast in order of acting ability, Arnie excepted, of course. We are left with Duke the best actor of the group by a mile. I always though the Predator cam was a mistake for it kills suspense. We know proximity by seeing through it. The scariest parts of the movie are at the end in the one on one battle where it does pop out on Arnie. Imagine Alien with a camera that shows proximity, it is a suspense killer. Yes, it is cool, but it would be scarier without it. The cast is great especially Ventura who has some really great lines in the movie. Like The Terminator, it is at the top because of its believability. We do not have Commando with Arnie taking out one hundred men hiding behind rosebushes. The Predator slowly whittles the group down, smaller and smaller and there is this growing sense of futility and impending doom. When Landham turns and says,We're all going to die, this is what makes it stand out. The first time you watch it in the dark it is one intense, unpredictable great movie. The Predator is not portrayed as invincible; it gets wounded a couple of times. This also adds verisimilitude to the movie. No movie is perfect; you have to endure Alan Silvestri's dreadful score. He always puts that Bahama xylophone in all his movies. He was big in the 80s and we have to endure it here. I hope someday McTiernan redoes the music for the film.The acting is weak in the back end of the cast but, like I said, do not worry the Predator kills the worst actors first. Duke really is great in the movie; always an invisible actor, he turns in his usual great acting. Please, stop with Die Hard, this was McTiernan's masterpiece.

Sadly, that sense seems to be fading. This tale of triple obsession (yes, triple) should've been a huge turkey. Difficult to believe it ever broke even, never mind made a profit, as I see it has from this website, though I reckon it must've taken a while. Visually it's interesting, the only real strong point from De Palma that I'd note, though given the Italian locations especially it's still surprising he doesn't do more with the visuals. The performances he gets are barely satisfactory and rarely convincing, not helped by a ridiculously bewigged and mustachioed John Lithgow. Cliff Robertson, a fine actor, is suitable for the romantic side of the story but never at any time convinces as someone tortured by guilt for some 15\/16 years.That may not have been entirely his fault since the Paul Schrader script gives him, and everyone else, so little to work with. Full of anomalies and plot holes, while the viewer will likely have every plot twist worked out in the first 25 minutes, the script itself doesn't seem to know where it's going for the first hour with it's snail's pace development and reliance on atmospheric score to keep the audience warm.I've seen this called a psychological thriller but what thrills it has, and there aren't many and they aren't that thrilling , mostly come in the first and last ten minutes. Having sat through most of the movie waiting for something to happen, when it does, it only highlights the worst shortcomings of script and direction with unbelievable character u-turns, revelations, coincidences and just plain stupidity, such as Robertson going to the airport to book a flight , finding out there's one about to leave at that moment and just running for it without getting a ticket. The script actually makes a comic moment of it just to emphasise how stupid it is. (Even stupider than the 1959 New Orleans police as represented here also.) The film ends, more or less, with a priceless look of bewilderment on Robertson's face as, even with all the previous revelations, he finally starts to understand what has happened to him. He can't do tortured guilt, but by goodness he can do bewilderment. Funnily enough that exact look was visible on the faces of quite a few others in the cinema as the lights went up, though most likely for other reasons, that they'd sat through it all, that it had ever got made in the first place, that this stylish piece of trash could come from De Palma, etc..

","genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"10 July 2015","score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" I'm writing this with the chanting of the initiation scene of the masked ball running through my head, over and over again.Kubrick's movies don't come alive on first viewing. At least they never did for me. It's with the second of third viewing that you begin scratching the surface of the first of many layers of meaning that his masterpieces have to offer. Last night was my second viewing of 'Eyes Wide Shut' and it left me disturbed, dumbfounded and questioning.I haven't stopped asking myself 'What is this movie really about?'. It is not simply about sexual desire, or lifelong commitment to another human being, nor is it about an illuminati kind of world that operates next to our society that we are completely unaware of. These are just the symbols that Kubrick plays with. But what do the symbols mean?What I think Kubrick wanted to do with this movie, is to show how deeply disturbing sex and sexual fantasies can be. It is a feeling that can hardly be expressed using words, which is why Kubrick tried it with this film.Bergman was on the same mission when he made 'Persona', which this movie strangely kept reminding me of. Watch it and see for yourself whether you can find the similarities. Keep an eye out for disturbingly explicit sexual fantasies that are being expressed by a woman. Hearing that as a man feels like being being stabbed in the heart by your own partner, laughing, which is exactly what Alice did in her sleep.Side note The cinematography of this movie reminded me of David Linch' Twin Peaks at times. Especially of the dream scenes. When I woke up this morning, the first thing I wondered was what if Alice was actually present at the orgy? The dream she described is very similar to the orgy scene at the masked ball, except she could hardly have been physically present. What if she was mentally present somehow? What if the whole thing was some sort of (collective) dream? A merging of sexual desires and fantasies. The place where they come true.What is blatantly obvious is how important William's occupation and title as a doctor is. I don't know how many times he pulled out his ID throughout the movie to identify himself as Dr. Harford, but if you were to make a compilation of it it would be hard to believe that this was all in just one movie, instead a whole TV series. What does this mean? Why is his role as a doctor so important and how does it relate to what Kubrick was trying to achieve?

He's had at least 4 opportunities to cheat throughout the course of the movie, but he never did. It makes you wonder why didn't he? 'Fidelio' (faithfulness) was the only word he knew and spoke with confidence at the intervention at the masked ball... When he was called to Ziegler's room to fix the situation with the OD'ing prostitute Mandy, he did so in such a professional manner and we never saw the two models he was flirting with before, again. His profession and his oath are clearly more important to him than fulfilling his own sexual desires. Even though he may look and act like a flirt.Was he being honest when he told Alice that he only thinks about the health of his client when he is in his role of a doctor? Was he mentally fidelio?We know Alice wasn't. She admitted to have cheated on him mentally, which raises the question is mentally cheating cheating as well? It certainly feels that way to William, who put on a fake smile when he saw Alice helping their daughter with her math. Their marriage was no longer the same.The scene where William is sitting in the taxi, picturing his wife having sex with the marine, may be the most pivotal scene of the movie. You can feel how disturbed he is by the mere fantasy of his wife being unfaithful. It destroys him. And as a man, I know exactly what that feeling feels like.

Last night was my second viewing of 'Eyes Wide Shut' and it left me disturbed, dumbfounded and questioning.I haven't stopped asking myself 'What is this movie really about?'. It is not simply about sexual desire, or lifelong commitment to another human being, nor is it about an illuminati kind of world that operates next to our society that we are completely unaware of. These are just the symbols that Kubrick plays with. But what do the symbols mean?What I think Kubrick wanted to do with this movie, is to show how deeply disturbing sex and sexual fantasies can be. It is a feeling that can hardly be expressed using words, which is why Kubrick tried it with this film.Bergman was on the same mission when he made 'Persona', which this movie strangely kept reminding me of. Watch it and see for yourself whether you can find the similarities. Keep an eye out for disturbingly explicit sexual fantasies that are being expressed by a woman.

Especially of the dream scenes. When I woke up this morning, the first thing I wondered was what if Alice was actually present at the orgy? The dream she described is very similar to the orgy scene at the masked ball, except she could hardly have been physically present. What if she was mentally present somehow? What if the whole thing was some sort of (collective) dream? A merging of sexual desires and fantasies. The place where they come true.What is blatantly obvious is how important William's occupation and title as a doctor is. I don't know how many times he pulled out his ID throughout the movie to identify himself as Dr. Harford, but if you were to make a compilation of it it would be hard to believe that this was all in just one movie, instead a whole TV series. What does this mean? Why is his role as a doctor so important and how does it relate to what Kubrick was trying to achieve?

Dana Kimmell, who plays Chris Higgins, is nowhere near good enough of an actress to play the lead role in any film and Paul Kafka, who plays Rick, can't act to save his life. His next on screen role wasn't for another 24 years, which isn't terribly surprising. Both of the film's supporting female stars, Tracie Savage and in particular Catherine Parks, would have been much better as Chris while Jeffrey Rogers should have probably been cast as Rick instead of Andy. The characters are all likable and some of them even seem like real people but I have to say that the bikers were more interesting! One thing that really bothered me about the film though was the fact that the Wild Bunch as they like to call themselves decide that it's a good idea to holiday within a few miles at most of an extraordinarily brutal murder spree which left eight people the day before and the killer is still at large, which is reported on the news at the beginning of this film. I suppose that you could argue that they didn't hear about it since they never mention it but that seems a bit far- fetched considering how extensively comparable events in real life are reported in the media. Failing that, have they no parents, friends or siblings who would have heard about the massacre with the good sense to warn them not to go? Besides which, you would think that the police would have the entire area cordoned off as Jason is still at large. In the previous film, the filmmakers at least had the good sense to move the action forward five years and even then the characters discussed Mrs Voorhees, Jason and the previous massacre.Released during the 3-D craze of the early 1980s, the filmmakers decided that it would be good idea to enhance the audience's illusion of depth perception for the third film. I'm not a big of 3-D but at least we were spared the film being entitled Friday the 13th Part 3-D as was the case with Jaws 3-D and Amityville 3-D, both of which were released in 1983.

I watched the film in 2-D but the fact that the film was shot in 3-D was still very obvious when things like the baseball bat and yo-yo come at the screen for no reason other than the fact that it's a 3-D film.However, I'd no such problem with the numerous scenes of murder, violence and mayhem, many of which were very well done and among the most gruesome to grace the series up to this point.

Best Picture went to Forrest Gump, while Shawshank and Pulp Fiction were just happy to be nominated. Of course hindsight is 20\/20, but while history looks back on Gump as a good film, Pulp and Redemption are remembered as some of the all-time best. Pulp, however, was a success from the word go, making a huge splash at Cannes and making its writer-director an American master after only two films. For Andy Dufresne and Co., success didn't come easy. Fortunately, failure wasn't a life sentence.After opening on 33 screens with take of $727,327, the $25M film fell fast from theatres and finished with a mere $28.3M. The reasons for failure are many. Firstly, the title is a clunker. While iconic to fans today, in 1994, people knew not and cared not what a 'Shawshank' was. On the DVD, Tim Robbins laughs recounting fans congratulating him on that 'Rickshaw' movie. Marketing-wise, the film's a nightmare, as 'prison drama' is a tough sell to women, and the story of love between two best friends doesn't spell winner to men. Worst of all, the movie is slow as molasses. As Desson Thomson writes for the Washington Post, it wanders down subplots at every opportunity and ignores an abundance of narrative exit points before settling on its finale. But it is these same weaknesses that make the film so strong.Firstly, its setting. The opening aerial shots of the prison are a total eye-opener. This is an amazing piece of architecture, strong and Gothic in design. Immediately, the prison becomes a character. It casts its shadow over most of the film, its tall stone walls stretching above every shot. It towers over the men it contains, blotting out all memories of the outside world. Only Andy (Robbins) holds onto hope. It's in music, it's in the sandy beaches of Zihuatanejo; In here's where you need it most, he says. You need it so you don't forget. Forget that there are places in the world that aren't made out of stone. That there's a - there's a - there's something inside that's yours, that they can't touch. Red (Morgan Freeman) doesn't think much of Andy at first, picking that tall glass o' milk with the silver spoon up his ass as the first new fish to crack. Andy says not a word, and losing his bet, Red resents him for it. But over time, as the two get to know each other, they quickly become the best of friends. This again, is one of the film's major strengths. Many movies are about love, many flicks have a side-kick to the hero, but Shawshank is the only one I can think of that looks honestly at the love between two best friends. It seems odd that Hollywood would skip this relationship time and again, when it's a feeling that weighs so much into everyone's day to day lives. Perhaps it's too sentimental to seem conventional, but Shawshank's core friendship hits all the right notes, and the film is much better for it.It's pacing is deliberate as well. As we spend the film watching the same actors, it is easy to forget that the movie's timeline spans well over 20 years. Such a huge measure of time would pass slowly in reality, and would only be amplified in prison. And it's not as if the film lacks interest in these moments. It still knows where it's going, it merely intends on taking its sweet time getting there. It pays off as well, as the tedium of prison life makes the climax that much more exhilarating. For anyone who sees it, it is a moment never to be forgotten.With themes of faith and hope, there is a definite religious subtext to be found here. Quiet, selfless and carefree, Andy is an obvious Christ figure. Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) is obviously modeled on Richard Nixon, who, in his day, was as close to a personified Satan as they come. But if you aren't looking for subtexts, the movie speaks to anyone in search of hope. It is a compelling drama, and a very moving film, perfectly written, acted and shot. They just don't come much better than this.OVERALL SCORE 9.8\/10 = A+ The Shawshank Redemption served as a message of hope to Hollywood as well. More than any film in memory, it proved there is life after box office. Besting Forrest and Fiction, it ran solely on strong word of mouth and became the hottest rented film of 1995. It currently sits at #2 in the IMDb's Top 250 Films, occasionally swapping spots with The Godfather as the top ranked film of all time -- redemption indeed. If you haven't seen it yet, what the hell are you waiting for? As Andy says, It comes down a simple choice, really. Either get busy living, or get busy dying.

It currently sits at #2 in the IMDb's Top 250 Films, occasionally swapping spots with The Godfather as the top ranked film of all time -- redemption indeed. If you haven't seen it yet, what the hell are you waiting for? As Andy says, It comes down a simple choice, really. Either get busy living, or get busy dying.

What follows is a spectacle that incorporates a lot of elements and themes What is human? Inhuman? What is the perfect crime? Is there a Nietzschian superhuman concept?

The climax and denouement are so unraveling that it makes up for some of the chatter before the point of no return. Having seen Farley Granger in Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train, I was really looking forward to see him here. He did an OK performance, as the more androgynous and anxious part of the two partners in crime. Thus, it is not a classic whodunnit - we know who the culprits are two minutes in the film.

Starting off with a string of fairly strong productions, leading into a descent in quality and finally finishing on a good note, he has certainly left a legacy. Whether it's a good one or not is up to the individual, but I personally take the positive perspective. Though there is bitter irony in that his work has largely been pushed into obscurity by Disney productions these last couple of decades, he was on the right track in some regards, and that is greatly demonstrated by his first feature.Mice and rats have always been a good choice for anthropomorphized animals. Why that is remains a mystery, but Disney took notice of that by several original sources, such as those for The Rescuers and The Great Mouse Detective. The decision to adapt this film's book counterpart was particularly inspired, as it provides a premise that regards these animals' human level intelligence as more than a mere fact of life. Yet, even though endowed with the characteristics of humans, we're reminded that they are still mice and rats. They live at the mercy of the people whose land they inhabit, making their world separate and distant from that of humanity. More so than most of the Disney films, this is a movie that shows us what it might be like seeing the world from the viewpoint of a small animal&#x85;and it can be frightening.Animation quality is of particular note, given that it was a primary motivation for Bluth's departure from Disney. He certainly made his point here, as The Secret of NIMH sports a variety of interesting settings and frequent character movement. As many point out, this is a fairly dark movie, but not in a cheap shocks manner like Watership Down. This is a movie that earns its darkness by virtue of a brooding atmosphere that complements the situation; after all, survival and the threat of death are at the forefront. The image of Mrs. Brisby standing on a rock at dusk is more faithful to the cover of Watership Down than anything in that movie. Fog and shadow are prevalent, painting the portrait of an enigmatic world, which indeed this is. How many sights does the main character behold that most have not? And what sights they are, including the unforgettable Great Owl and the technologically enhanced burrow of the rats.However, the single greatest achievement of the movie is a lot simpler than technical aptitude. Strong lead characters have become increasingly uncommon, all too often overshadowed by a colorful supporting cast, a trend animation is not immune to. The Secret of NIMH expertly avoids that problem by the truly remarkable Mrs. Brisby. Single parents are abundant in animation, but rarely is the situation seen from their point of view, a direction that gives us a sympathetic central figure with honorable intentions and challenges that feel real. Consider a wonderful scene where she sits in a room with her four children, simply feeding one of them. The same way that mothers are called the heart and soul of households, so is Mrs. Brisby the heart and soul of this movie, as she endures emotional and physical tribulations and undergoes an evolution in bravery that hits all the right notes. Elizabeth Hartman's excellent performance is no small contributor to this, granting the correct blend of warmth and vulnerability. With little doubt, this is an exemplary character for animated features.The rest of the cast is another matter. Roger Ebert once pointed out that the abundance of characters prevents them from engaging us emotionally, and I would agree. No one else in the cast is allotted enough time to become a fully realized individual, and fewer linger in memory after the credits roll. The villain is kind of an afterthought, and the rats are each defined by a single characteristic. That's not to say everyone was devoid of charm or intrigue, though. I did like Mrs. Brisby's daughters, Teresa and Cynthia, the Shrew is amusingly pompous, and the Great Owl is awe-inspiring. The one true blotch in this area is the crow, Jeremy. Obviously, he was intended for comic relief, but not only is such a thing out of place for this type of film; he himself is out of place. The attempts at humor are gratingly flat and his personality just conflicts with the sobering tone, a problem that wouldn't be so noteworthy if nearly every scene he is in weren't needlessly drawn out. Why he is included to such an extent is beyond me, as he serves virtually no purpose in the story and his moments with Mrs. Brisby end up being pitiful instead of endearing, since most of the time she clearly recognizes what a nuisance he his.True to its nature, The Secret of NIMH was a real mystery to me during my earlier years, since it was the last Don Bluth film I managed to see. Initially, all I knew of it came from brief clips in MGM trailers, and the images (particularly the one of the climax) were certainly stirring enough to grab my attention. When I finally did see it, I regarded it highly, and am pleased to say it provided its Disney contemporaries with worthy competition.
