Just that it's a 1930's comedy with a lot of funny gags that almost started a genre - the screwball comedy.The plot is about a museum caretaker that goes to a golf match trying to raise money for the museum, but he bumps into Susan Vance, a woman that falls in love with him, and does everything to keep him around. It's really one big mess, with even leopards appearing, but that's why it's very funny. It doesn't make a whole lot sense, but it's nice to watch. You don't get bored one minute of it. The main leads here are Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn. They are both great in their parts. Cary Grant doesn't play his usual kinda of guy - here he is weird, with a big glass, etc, but he has a great comedy timing. Never saw him in a comedy movie before, but he gets the job done. Katharine Hepburn is also nice, but not as great as her male counterpart. Howard Hawks' also does a nice job directing.So, this is a funny, light and entertaining 30' comedy, the type of movie you watch on a Sunday afternoon with the whole family - but that's it.

I imagined it as a romantic comedy of sorts, and yet from the very beginning it was really quite heavy, dealing as it did with young Connie (Rikki Lake) being homeless, then meeting up with a sleazebag and then being tossed out by him when he gets her pregnant. I really wasn't feeling much fun at that point in the movie. Then mistaken identity turns into deliberate deceit on Connie's part (although I understand it wasn't malicious.) Once she gets taken in by the Winterbourne's after the train wreck that kills their son and his wife (whom the family has never met, and whom Connie is mistaken for) the only character who really made sense to me was Bill (Brendan Fraser), who seemed appropriately suspicious of her given the circumstances. True, he was ridiculously obnoxious, but his suspicion was bang on, except that he then, for no obvious reason that I saw, fell head over heels in love with her, letting go of all his suspicions and deciding to marry her! Where did that come from?There are some moments of fun in this. Shirley MacLaine (as the matriarch of the Winterbourne clan) was probably the best part of the movie and provided much of the comedy, and the closing scenes (as everyone tries to protect Connie\/Patricia) was quite touching, as was the point that the Winterbournes became the family she never had. There was a nice feel to that, especially because we know that Connie isn't out for the family's money, but just wants the sense of family for herself and even more for her son.There was one huge inconsistency here that just made everything else implausible, though. Bill finally figures out what's going on because he sees Patricia sign Connie Doyle on a check, and investigates who Connie Doyle is. He gets back a report that Connie and her unborn baby were killed in the train wreck (it was, of course, the real Patricia and her unborn baby who were killed.) How would he get that report? Connie wasn't supposed to be on that train. She got swept into it by a huge crowd of people, she had no ticket, and since it wasn't really Connie there would be no way of identifying the body as Connie. How then would anyone come to the conclusion that the dead body was Connie when no one knew Connie was on that train - and, in fact, no one on that train even knew Connie?This isn't an unenjoyable movie. It's quite touching, really - but it does have a lot of flaws! 5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"19 January 2010","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" My first bit of confusion was over exactly where this movie wanted to go.

But they are not entirely army material, making their own rules as they go. Of special interest is of course the nurses. And making extra money. Around them the whole camp turns to a circus.Comments A classic movie, a very cynical satire of the essence of war. Somewhat graphic and gory for its time but nowadays it is nothing to speak of. Instead it is a pure enjoyment to watch all the characters shape their own world. The story revolves mostly around Hawkeye, Trapper and Duke Forrest, each with their own special character, even if they have their total disrespect and disregard of regulations and proper conduct in common. That is really the foundation of the movie. It is funny, but not in any way that any recent Hollywood blockbuster would be. It is really another type of humor. It is cynical and, I wouldn't call it subtle, but is more low key than what we're used of today.The movie was followed up by a popular series and if you want a fun comedy I would actually recommend that over the movie. Not that the movie was bad or dull in any way, but the movie has a more serious undertone, whereas the series I feel is more pure comedy. The undertone is of course the anti-war statement. It lies in the cynical comedy and can actually go undetected if you don't think about it, and only watch it for the jokes and puns. But reading about how Fox and the army reacted to the movie is almost as much fun as watching the movie itself.There is another dimension to the movie, due to time. Director Altman managed to gather quite a few young actors that come to have respectable careers, and still are stars today. Therefore you can see Donald Sutherland, Elliot Gould, Tom Skerritt, Robert Duvall, Rene Auberjonois and Michael Murphy in much earlier roles. Some in just the beginning of their careers. And quite frankly, some of them is hard to recognize.A little of the movies charm and sense of being current has been lost through the years. Still it is a very good and entertaining movie, and absolutely watchable due to its classic status.

Reading the summary, I didn't think it was good, but when I read the name of the directors and writers, I decided to give it a chance. After all, they were the guys who brought us The Naked Gun, the funniest movie I've ever seen. And I don't regret the decision. I've watched - and loved it!This one is obviously set on an Airplane, and when the crew gets ill, it's up to ex-pilot Ted Striker to save the day and land the plane. This very basic plot gives room to ZAZ (Zucker, Abraham and Zucker) to write lots of funny jokes. They throw one joke after another, and they are all really funny, except in the beginning. The movie didn't start so well, but as soon as the plane takes off, it gets awesome. You get to meet lots of eccentric and extremely funny characters, with a nice overall acting.

In fact some scenes in this film had me laughing out loud(particularly Jim Carrey's insane karaoke version of Somebody To Love).

Stiller also shows some promise as a director and overall the film is a fairly well put together. I think its downfall lies just in the irregularity of its feeling, by which I mean the film doesn't stick to one specific genre and some might consider this a bit sloppy. In any case, this is by no means a bad movie and I would recommend to anyone as a nice late night cable flick.

Despite the fact that it didn't fare too well in theaters and critics all but universally panned it, there is more to this white-trash tale than meets the eye.Boasting an impressive classic rock soundtrack and a host of off-key performances and cameos from the likes of Christopher Walken and Kevin Nealon, Joe Dirt revolves around the titular character, portrayed by David Spade, as he tells his inspiring and often hilarious life-story to a shock-jock (Dennis Miller) and his loyal audience across America. From being abandoned by his parents as a child at the Grand Canyon to finding companionship in a golden retriever and its stunning owner (Brittany Daniel) and getting sexually confused by a floozy whom he mistakes as his sister (Jaime Pressly), Joe's life story plays as fodder for those around him to mock, but in the end, wins everyone over with its inspiring message.Afterall, the key to this movie is its feel-good spirit. What sets this movie aside from so many other comedies in a similar vein is that it is uplifting and touching, while being utterly hilarious at the same time. Because it's a movie that makes you feel good, you'll find yourself watching it again and again, and thankfully, the humor never gets old, as even by your hundredth viewing, you'll still be cracking up at the often broad but simplistic humor. David Spade is playing a likable role for once, and while it went by virtually unnoticed by many critics, his performance is worthy of praise and shows that the comedian has range beyond his usual snarky smart-aleck type-casting. Bottom line Joe Dirt is both funny and inspiring, a rare combination. Dig it.

It is such a perfectly- crafted film. The writing is divine, balancing the despair and confusion of trying to understand oneself with glimpses of truly satisfying comedy. Each scene is well-balanced, providing both meaningful insight and a sense of being lost, as Guido tries to balance his past, present, and supposed future. Unlike the recent musical retelling, 8½ features characters with actual depth. Guido isn't just a senseless wanderer trying to make sense of his life, searching for justification for his lifestyle, or making a picture simply because the studio wants him to. He has a message he wants to send, and in the course of relaying that message, he hopes to find some peace of mind. Guido here is a much more compelling character, because he is trying to do something, not passively watching the film taking shape and shrugging his shoulders.The women in the film also serve as more than objects used to define the director. Their relationships with Guido are more authentic, and it's clear how each one has influenced him. He's a man who loves women without really being able to love them, so instead of respectfully drawing inspiration from each woman, he instead tries to drain them of any compelling or exciting qualities. They aren't muses to be admired and translated; they're oranges to squeeze which will hopefully yield a meaningful juice.The collision of fantasy and reality results in the film's dreamy feeling, supported by the stylistic system. Every shot is beautifully executed, whether it's capturing something odd, like a body floating high above the beach, or something more grounded in reality, such as a dinner. The consistency of Fellini's shot, editing, etc. results in a seamless integration of the real and unreal, often making scenes open to interpretation. It's thrilling film-making, to be sure, especially when the film delves completely into Guido's fantasy world, where all the women he has admired move in together to pamper him.Ultimately, what makes 8½ an amazing film is the focus on honesty. Guido himself is a dishonest man, but the film allows the viewer to see him for who he really is, and how he tries to be better through his art. He can't bring himself to confront his wife, Luisa, about their troubled marriage, so instead he writes a scene of the conversation they need to have. Film provides an escape for the viewer, but it's fascinating to see it from the other side as a way for a director to vicariously live alternate versions of his life. Within the film-to-be, Guido can expose himself fully without the risk of being judged. It's a confession that will not, in the end, be taken seriously. Except by Luisa and the other women who see themselves in the characters, of course.It's Luisa's reaction to the screen tests that motivates Guido to try to be better. As a director, he has run out of things to say, because he has gotten to the point where his art and his real life collide. He has always lived in a world blurred between fantasy and reality, but now his art is too real to escape into. Guido comes to realize that he can't say anything more in his films until he says what must be said in his own relationships. Art is an expression, but it can never be as sincere as an actual act. The fact that seeing a man come to understand this truth is both moving and oddly cathartic. 8½ is a masterpiece in the truest sense of the word.10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"19 January 2010","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" 8½ is deservedly considered to be one of film's greatest masterpieces.

The idea of playing chess with death is very inventive, brilliant, but if you put it in a good story. Ingmar Bergman was the best director to do that in the best way, but this time, impossible to accept, he could not turn the idea to good account. The movie's content is not about playing chess with death, this is very important. This is just a sub story. Yes, the film is not about the fellowship of two chess players anyway, but when I read the man who plays chess with death, I supposed that the story would be like one day, a crusader encounters death. Death requires a chess game, if the man wins, he is set free, if the death does, the man dies. The chess game continues for months and till the game ends, his questions about life, death and God are answered. In the end, the man loses. The whole movie focuses on this deadly chess game with certain intervals. In these intervals, you also can show us the villagers who are suffered from plague. It might sound weird, but this had been my expectation. After the first thirty minutes, the story is scattered, collapsed, then we loose our attention, because the movie changes its route. As a result of this, the potential of the story gets out of hand. We are forced to forget the crusader, the crusader's situation. Bergman is not interested in this character enough and also the chess game that seems the heart of the movie, but it is not and it should have been. The chess game cannot be named as a metaphor, because, this is not the point, thus the image which the man who plays chess with death exists as just an image. The crowd make a celebration, they start to sing a song, there is a husband and wife, I mean we see pictures desultory from each other. Those pictures are like theater, but in contrast, not dramatic, not impressive at all. This is the story of 'black death' more, not death. As for direction, only one sentence can summarize the film the way of storytelling is not powerful. By the way, the crusader encounters the death and the death says I am death, look at the reaction of him; nothing. He is like OK, what's that to me? Sorry, but the name of this is not art. It is stressed that he is a nihilist? However, it looks unconvincing at the end. This is not so important, but this scene deserves to be dramatic. I watched The Virgin Spring and Smultronstallet after The Seventh Seal in order to rehabilitate and I did. Lastly, almost everyone writes the same thing the film questionnaires the meaning of life, death, faith and the existence of God. Some films have a repetitious sentence and The Seventh Seal's sentence is this. Another commonly used word for the film is symbolism. I cannot give a movie 10 out of 10 owing to only its symbols and themes.

The idea of playing chess with death is very inventive, brilliant, but if you put it in a good story. Ingmar Bergman was the best director to do that in the best way, but this time, impossible to accept, he could not turn the idea to good account. The movie's content is not about playing chess with death, this is very important. This is just a sub story. Yes, the film is not about the fellowship of two chess players anyway, but when I read the man who plays chess with death, I supposed that the story would be like one day, a crusader encounters death. Death requires a chess game, if the man wins, he is set free, if the death does, the man dies. The chess game continues for months and till the game ends, his questions about life, death and God are answered. In the end, the man loses. The whole movie focuses on this deadly chess game with certain intervals. In these intervals, you also can show us the villagers who are suffered from plague. It might sound weird, but this had been my expectation. After the first thirty minutes, the story is scattered, collapsed, then we loose our attention, because the movie changes its route. As a result of this, the potential of the story gets out of hand. We are forced to forget the crusader, the crusader's situation. Bergman is not interested in this character enough and also the chess game that seems the heart of the movie, but it is not and it should have been. The chess game cannot be named as a metaphor, because, this is not the point, thus the image which the man who plays chess with death exists as just an image. The crowd make a celebration, they start to sing a song, there is a husband and wife, I mean we see pictures desultory from each other. Those pictures are like theater, but in contrast, not dramatic, not impressive at all. This is the story of 'black death' more, not death. As for direction, only one sentence can summarize the film the way of storytelling is not powerful. By the way, the crusader encounters the death and the death says I am death, look at the reaction of him; nothing. He is like OK, what's that to me? Sorry, but the name of this is not art. It is stressed that he is a nihilist? However, it looks unconvincing at the end. This is not so important, but this scene deserves to be dramatic. I watched The Virgin Spring and Smultronstallet after The Seventh Seal in order to rehabilitate and I did. Lastly, almost everyone writes the same thing the film questionnaires the meaning of life, death, faith and the existence of God. Some films have a repetitious sentence and The Seventh Seal's sentence is this. Another commonly used word for the film is symbolism.

As for Seven Samurai, In IMDb, the ratings higher than 8.5 are almost equal to 10 which means a masterpiece. I don't complain about the duration of the movies and if I feel sleepy or get bored (even if I get bored very rarely), I give up watching and watch the rest of the film the next day! However, the problem here is a bit different. The film was unnecessarily long for such a story. That causes it to lose its effect minute by minute. A group of farmers in a village decide to hire a few retired samurai to get rid of the racketeers. It would be great, if such a simple story had been told in 100 minutes. Unfortunately, Seven Samurai is one of the longest movies of all time! I mean the DVD version, I guess that the number of the people who got a chance to see the international version is not many. I forgot the main story totally after a while, loosed my attention. the story was scattered. Secondly, Seven Samurai is not artistic like other Kurosawa movies, it is the most pale, the most plain Kurosawa film ever. The content is so pale also, the story telling is pale. You watch, watch, watch and watch... By the way, some people say that Seven Samurai is an action film. There is only one action sequence in the whole film which takes place near the end!!! and it was pretty short. Therefore mind!, don't expect an action movie or a real samurai movie. This is a drama about Japanese farmers and a group of Samurai. In Ikiru, the last part had seemed me excessive or unnecessary either and made me think that sometimes, Kurosawa extends the story unnecessarily, but then I realized that the part was the heart of the film (İkiru) so I changed my mind. However, I would not say the same thing for Seven Samurai. It was too excessive like its rating.

Take this year's Avatar for example. It clearly cost a lot of money, but every penny was well spent, and the result is a wildly entertaining epic. A Few Good Men is another classic big-budget movie, and although it has no violence or special effects, it is nonetheless an extraordinarily compelling film that has capture the minds and hearts of millions since its release nearly twenty years ago (has it really been that long?).A young marine named Willie Santiago was murdered in his bedroom, possibly after threatening to rat out one of his superior officers for illegally firing his weapon. Two men, his commander, Harold Dawson (Wolfgang Bodison) and comrade, Louden Downey (James Marshall) are on trial for Santiago's murder. The lawyer assigned to defend them is Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise), who is all about making deals. But their sense of honor is so strong that they will not admit to something that isn't true, even if it meant that they could spend the rest of their lives in jail. The marines claim that they were ordered to give Santiago a Code Red (a sort of hazing act) by the respected Colenel Nathan Jessup (Jack Nicholson). Kaffee thinks their story is ridiculous, not to mention impossible to prove. But the lawyer he is working with, JoAnn Galloway (Demi Moore), sets out to prove their innocence.For a movie that's all talk, the script and performances have to be top-notch. Tom Cruise is terrific as the lawyer who would rather make deals than get the truth. But this is just a mask for the truth he's afraid he won't live up to his father's reputation (it's a cliché, I know, but Cruise is good enough that we actually believe it). What I really liked about Cruise's performance is that he carefully measures how gradually his character becomes invested in the case. First he's all about getting the best deal possible, then it's about what he can prove. Finally, he's determined to win at all costs. Director Rob Reiner plays this transformation gradually yet deliberately, and Cruise is up to the task.Demi Moore has the weakest part as the co-worker who sees through Kaffee's exterior, and the one who has to convince him to take a stand and fight for the truth, but Moore makes it all worthwhile. She's feisty and very independent (and she outranks Kaffee). Moore makes the most out of a clichéd part (at least when compared to the others).Then there's the film's real star Nicholson. If there is one reason why this movie is so popular, it's because of Nicholson. The setting and the culture of the Marine Base that plays so heavily in the plot is developed only through dialogue, and as spoken by Nicholson, it seems dark, dangerous, and very hard core. It's pure scenery-chewing, but that's what Nicholson does best.Director Rob Reiner knows exactly what to do with the material. He's got a strong story, but he also knows that this is an actor's show. He lets them do their best without too much interference; he does his job and they do theirs. The result is a near masterpiece. The only real reason keeping me from giving this film a 10 is an ill-placed and unneeded flashback.Nevertheless, this is an amazing film, and one of the few mysteries that is enjoyable enough to watch over and over again.

After seeing Keith Gordon's film adaptation of his book, it will be an immediate must-read in the near future. It's the kind of material that I'm sure if it wasn't made in 1995\/96 as a film, it would be picked up right away today in the time period when many period post\/present-Holocaust\/WW2 movies are quite popular. Except that this is much darker, though even more resonant, about the nature of playing roles and the real underlying horror of living with life after war than say The Reader. It's about the very real danger of pretending in wartime, which is what being a spy in WW2 is really all about.It would be one thing if Mother Night had a script with a lot of emotional depth and complexity about the moral choice and constant role- even after the war ends- for Howard W. Cambpell (Nick Nolte), which is does. But it's also just a really strong feat of cinematic technique. Keith Gordon is not someone I usually think of as a director of really strong material (more-so I think back to him as an actor, oddly enough featured briefly with Vonnegut himself in Back to School), but this is a revelation. He takes the story of Campbell as a story of a fractured life a German propaganda master (the only American left in Berlin), who is actually a spy for the Americans but can never have his identity revealed, and was before a playwright who really belonged to a nation of two, himself and his wife (Sheryl Lee). It follows him from his prison cell, awaiting trial in Israel in 1961, as he writes his memoir and tells of his disillusionment about being a 'pretend' Nazi, and then in 1960 in semi-hiding in a New York apartment, which is where the bulk of the film takes place.Mother Night can be quite heavy, like on a level one might associate with the Pianist, but on another more emotional-cerebral level than the stark poetry of that film. Gordon, by way of Vonnegut, is trying to give us a strong look at a man who has nothing, except the memory (and then later a weird transposition) of his long lost love in a sister who has come back to him in NYC, so he's left to his own devices when he befriends a painter (Alan Arkin, very very good here), and then is found out as a Nazi-in-hiding by a white supremacist newsletter, leading wackos to his apartment. On the surface this should be just a straightforward spy story, but not a thing is straightforward. The 'something' of this man's life is staggering, but it's ultimately of his own choosing. Campbell is one of those characters that could be analyzed for hours on end, but the same conclusions might be reached (and, in a way, mirrors the line Goebbels said) the bigger the lie, the more people believe it. That is except for the select few who started the lie and know its secret and power.But oh, it would be one thing if it were just a wonderful and tragic-comic tale, or another if it were featuring some really fantastic performances (which is does Nolte is at his very best here, and Sheryl Lee, who we might remember from Twin Peaks as Laura Palmer, stuns in multiple roles, especially in the scene when she reveals she's not 'really' Helga). It's also a gorgeously shot film, with brilliant lighting and shots that reflect the state of mind of the character, or just the starkness or sickening colors of the time (watch the scene where an old Campbell watches a film of his younger self spouting out a rant, the juxtaposition of faces is great). And the music selections rise the level of tragedy. It could be argued some of the music is too much, but at other times it elevates the material past its own usual dramatic dimensions and makes it operatic, solemn about human nature.It's not always an easy film to take emotionally, and some of the twists do have that tinge of whoa as in any spy story. But it's the subversion from Vonnegut that sticks through, the way of taking appearance and performance, of life imitating art imitating life imitating death, and making it into something worth remembering.

This DVD contains a radio dramatization from the time of the movie's release. This radio broadcast has Joseph Cotton in the Gregory Peck role and he plays it with wit and subtlety. This drove home to me my idea that Peck was a poor choice for this role. While neither he nor Joseph Cotton is an Englishman, as one would expect an English barrister to be, Cotton's radio acting here has more depth. I can believe he would become enamored of the exotic lady on trial. Peck has virtually one expression throughout, and I didn't buy, for a minute, that he couldn't help falling for his client. He did a masterful job as a lawyer in TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD fifteen years later, when he played a wooden figure who's heart is in his integrity. In THE PARADINE CASE, we're supposed to believe this solemn-looking figure has a weakness. It doesn't work. Hitchcock has his moments here, of course, as he does even in lesser pictures such as this.

A one-line concept that looks good on paper (which also worked in an earlier English film - Where the Buffalo Roam) goes terribly wrong thanks to inept and shallow writing. A well-intentioned idea gets crushed to smithereens under the weight of its own gargantuan ambition. A director so completely besotted by his own much applauded first films goes overboard with the devices that worked in his earlier film (The Fish King) - try counting the number of times the device of split screens is used in this flick. The problem is - what worked fabulously in The Fish King were the emotional excesses of the Karan Johar school of film-making, but here, 'emotion' doesn't quite grace us with its appearance on the screen - no, not even cursorily. The writer\/ director gives us 'relationships with one common problem - drugs', but where is the intensity, where is the depth, where is the 'emotion'? A 'tribute to drugs' sans emotion? And one that goes on and on and on...... Nah, it just cannot work!In my opinion, the basic requirement for a portmanteau film like this to work is that not only should each individual story be 'complete', it should - in some way or the other - follow the graph of the traditional three-act structure (screen writing guru, Tony Grisoni's Paradigm). That's the real reason why Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas didn't work for me. None of the stories had any depth or a roller-coaster ride of emotional ups and downs one expects in mainstream Hindi cinema. Also, the linkage between some of the stories seemed tenuous and very forced. It's not clear what Raoul Duke is doing at a Debbie Reynolds concert. If he was required to be present at the event for a neat wrap-up, why not conjure a few more coincidences and bring the others also to the affair? That would be neater.But yes, some of the stories did have a lot of promise. For one, the Dr Gonzo Chawla story tries to address a very real situation - mid-life crisis, but its journey is so linear that you're left wondering if it was really an issue. Similarly, the problem of commitment in the oddball journalist and his psychopathic lawyer story is also true to life. If only it was developed a little better. I felt that the more promising stories in this mish-mash were told from the male point of view, which is fine, but it brings down the emotional quotient of these stories because the female characters - Christina Ricci and Cameron Diaz in particular - have all the depth of a half-filled bath tub. Wasn't this film supposed to be about 'Hunter S. Thompson'? Now the actors. Johnny Depp still needs to learn acting, while Benicio Del Toro is dependable and endearing as ever. Gary Busey gets a role written just for him but sometimes overplay the boredom of his character. Since she didn't get a meaty character to portray, Christina Ricci uses her charming smile and natural acting style to cover up for it. Lyle Lovett is fine despite going a trifle over-the-top in a few scenes. Ayesha Takia has nothing much to do, but she does remind us that she's the same girl who surprised us with her bravura performance in Dor. Katherine Helmond tries to make up for that HUGE mistake called Bhagam Bhag, and succeeds to a large extent.That brings me the most irritating track of the film (which unpardonably ends up hogging the maximum screen time) - Johnny Depp and Dr Gonzo. The track is irritating mainly because of them. But I must credit them for their consistency. They're consistently BAD all through the film. Johnny Depp could well be the next queen of hamming - I don't buy the crap that his role (that of an 'Gonzo Journalist') required him to act over-the-top. Somebody should tell him the difference between being flamboyant because the character demands it and downright hamming. If you've seen Rakhi Sawant (who seems to be the inspiration behind this role) in her interviews and Bigg Boss you'll know what I mean. I strongly feel that if Nikhil Advani had taken Rakhi Sawant in this role rather than a bigger star like Johnny Depp, the story would have worked better. Johnny Depp's phony accent is.....well, Shannon Esra's Hindi is less accented than Johnny Depp's.To be fair to the director, he does manage to add some good directorial touches to the film. I particularly liked the use of grey as the predominant color in the Dr Gonzo story as a metaphor for their boring existence, and the bright colors that come into the story with the arrival of the drug usage. But will anyone choose to paint their house in varying, depressing shades of grey? That's acceptable cinematic license I would say. But when the film runs almost for 2 hours, it almost feels like the director is trying too hard to give the audience a glimpse of his 'touch' in an endlessly meandering montage of uninspiring sequences.Despite all these plot and acting flaws the movie is watchable but it could have been a lot better.

Terrance Young, who is the best thing to have happened to Bond alongside Martin Campbell, was a great director who truly understood the appeal of the character. It is no surprise that the Sean Connery's three best performances as 007 are under his direction and many of the cast and crew have been quoted as saying that Terrance WAS James Bond in attitude and appearance.Connery completely inhabits the role and is a commanding screen presence. His introduction has to be one of the coolest and most memorable of a movie character, long before Bond, James Bond became a catchphrase it was just a really cool line.Ursula Andress as Honey Ryder has possibly the most iconic scene of the film as she steps out of the ocean in a white bikini and she is surely a stunning beauty. Besides that, she isn't too memorable but she does what is required of her. The supporting part which really stands out is Anthony Dawson as Professor Dent. He has a unique look and style and makes the most out of what on paper is not that great of a role. He would later return to the franchise in both From Russia With Love and Thunderball as the faceless Blofeld (the voice was dubbed however). Felix Leiter pops up in this first instalment and is played by Jack Lord. It is another great character performance and was the only time in the series up until Live And Let Die that Leiter was 007's equal and not just an incompetent sidekick.The setting is fantastic. Ted Moore's photography makes Jamaica look absolutely beautiful and Ken Adams' production design so impressed Stanley Kubrick that he hired him for his next film, Dr Strangelove. John Barry's score is great but of course most of the accolades must go to Monty Norman for creating the iconic Bond theme. Again, try to forget how over-used and spoofed this has become and revel in its utter coolness. Having said that, it is somewhat over used in THIS film, it plays in the back of scenes where it seemingly has no place and can sometimes be distracting. This is one of the very few missteps director Young takes. The opening titles by Maurice Binder are an awesome bit of pop art, I was shocked to find that these titles were created by the same man who did the ones in later films as they are akin to something you would expect from Saul Bass rather than the bloke who garishly projected neon lights onto women's bodies in later years.After the silliness of Brosnan's tenure as Bond it was refreshing to see Daniel Craig's somewhat brutal take on the character but far too many people think Craig was the first to give Bond a cold blooded streak. All the actors who have portrayed him, even Roger Moore, managed to inject a sense of heartlessness into the character but Connery has probably the best (and coolest) moment right in this, his very first performance. After a would be assassin has spent all his ammo and then tries for another shot at point blank range, Bond quips That's a Smith & Wesson, and you've had your six before coldly firing 2 shots into the defenceless man. Rumour has it censors trimmed out Bond pumping a few more rounds into the guy as he lies on the floor already dead.There is an excellent 3 act structure employed in Dr. No which was copied many times in the sequels but never quite done as well. As Bond makes his way through the film, discovering the truth and getting closer to the bad guy we really get a feel of him being drawn into the villain's world deeper and deeper until he ends up in the heart of the villain's lair. It has an almost 'Alice going further into the rabbit hole' feeling. The only real nitpick I have with the film is that the villain's lair ultimately looks a bit like a naff 60' Bond villain's lair but that is hardly surprising given the circumstances! Watch Dr. No back to back with From Russia With Love and remember how good Bond could be before he started relying on gadgets and gimmicks. There are many later films, Live And Let Die, Goldeneye, The Living Daylights and Casino Royale to name a few which are as good as Dr. No but none of them have the fresh, innocent feeling that this film has, before 007 films became a brand and producers started trying to cater to what they thought an audience wanted.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller"},{"date":"19 January 2010","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" James Bond's first cinematic outing is also one of his finest. Terrance Young, who is the best thing to have happened to Bond alongside Martin Campbell, was a great director who truly understood the appeal of the character. It is no surprise that the Sean Connery's three best performances as 007 are under his direction and many of the cast and crew have been quoted as saying that Terrance WAS James Bond in attitude and appearance.Connery completely inhabits the role and is a commanding screen presence. His introduction has to be one of the coolest and most memorable of a movie character, long before Bond, James Bond became a catchphrase it was just a really cool line.Ursula Andress as Honey Ryder has possibly the most iconic scene of the film as she steps out of the ocean in a white bikini and she is surely a stunning beauty. Besides that, she isn't too memorable but she does what is required of her. The supporting part which really stands out is Anthony Dawson as Professor Dent. He has a unique look and style and makes the most out of what on paper is not that great of a role. He would later return to the franchise in both From Russia With Love and Thunderball as the faceless Blofeld (the voice was dubbed however). Felix Leiter pops up in this first instalment and is played by Jack Lord. It is another great character performance and was the only time in the series up until Live And Let Die that Leiter was 007's equal and not just an incompetent sidekick.The setting is fantastic. Ted Moore's photography makes Jamaica look absolutely beautiful and Ken Adams' production design so impressed Stanley Kubrick that he hired him for his next film, Dr Strangelove. John Barry's score is great but of course most of the accolades must go to Monty Norman for creating the iconic Bond theme. Again, try to forget how over-used and spoofed this has become and revel in its utter coolness. Having said that, it is somewhat over used in THIS film, it plays in the back of scenes where it seemingly has no place and can sometimes be distracting. This is one of the very few missteps director Young takes. The opening titles by Maurice Binder are an awesome bit of pop art, I was shocked to find that these titles were created by the same man who did the ones in later films as they are akin to something you would expect from Saul Bass rather than the bloke who garishly projected neon lights onto women's bodies in later years.After the silliness of Brosnan's tenure as Bond it was refreshing to see Daniel Craig's somewhat brutal take on the character but far too many people think Craig was the first to give Bond a cold blooded streak. All the actors who have portrayed him, even Roger Moore, managed to inject a sense of heartlessness into the character but Connery has probably the best (and coolest) moment right in this, his very first performance. After a would be assassin has spent all his ammo and then tries for another shot at point blank range, Bond quips That's a Smith & Wesson, and you've had your six before coldly firing 2 shots into the defenceless man. Rumour has it censors trimmed out Bond pumping a few more rounds into the guy as he lies on the floor already dead.There is an excellent 3 act structure employed in Dr. No which was copied many times in the sequels but never quite done as well. As Bond makes his way through the film, discovering the truth and getting closer to the bad guy we really get a feel of him being drawn into the villain's world deeper and deeper until he ends up in the heart of the villain's lair. It has an almost 'Alice going further into the rabbit hole' feeling. The only real nitpick I have with the film is that the villain's lair ultimately looks a bit like a naff 60' Bond villain's lair but that is hardly surprising given the circumstances! Watch Dr. No back to back with From Russia With Love and remember how good Bond could be before he started relying on gadgets and gimmicks.

Just several weeks ago, still remembering the story very well, I finally watched the 1939 film for the first time, which is the first of two theatrically released adaptations of John Steinbeck's 1937 novella, and a very good one at that. I intended to watch this 1992 version (the second theatrical adaptation of the story) again after watching its predecessor, and that's what I did. Apparently, more than one TV adaptation was made in between these two films, and I haven't seen any of them, but I have now seen both theatrical versions, and even though one was made over fifty years after the other, they are both impressive.Lennie Small and George Milton are two ranch workers in Great Depression-era United States. Lennie is a mentally handicapped man of large stature and doesn't realize his own strength. He doesn't mean any harm, but still gets into a lot of trouble. George has to look after him and often has to get him out of trouble, and for this reason, they can't keep a job. They constantly have to move whenever Lennie gets in trouble and find work somewhere else, but the two of them dream of having their own house and acres of land. They find employment at Tyler Ranch, where they make friends with some of their co-workers, including an elderly man named Candy, but also face the ranch owner's mean-spirited son, Curley, who hates big guys like Lennie and has a neglected wife who is lonely and tries to be social, but George tells Lennie to stay away from her.The lead characters, Lennie and George, are played here by John Malkovich and Gary Sinise, and these two co-stars both really stand out, just like Lon Chaney Jr. and Burgess Meredith do in the 1939 version. Sinise also directed this film, and did a good job with that as well. Malkovich's portrayal of Lennie is very clearly different from that of Chaney, and some may criticize it for the stereotypical handicapped voice and such, but I would say both versions of the character are good in their own way, even if Chaney's is slightly better. One problem I found with this 1992 film is Sherilyn Fenn's portrayal of Curley's wife. I'm not sure exactly how to describe it, but it's slightly disappointing, and it seemed to me that the part where she is introduced could have been more focused. Betty Field's performance in this role in the first film is superior. However, most of the cast's performances here are still impressive, and as anyone who is familiar with the story would expect, this film is very poignant at times. I personally didn't find the part with Candy losing his dog as moving here as the way it was done in the first adaptation, but in the end, this second theatrical adaptation of the story basically leaves the viewer with the same emotions as the first one does.Which film is better, the 1939 version or this 1992 version? That's a tough call! Both films have their flaws, but are still very good and unforgettable, basically for the same reasons. They are also both very faithful to the book, even though they're obviously not exactly the same. The original adaptation of Steinbeck's classic MIGHT be better than this one by just a little bit, but if so, this film still comes VERY close to matching that one! It could have been far inferior, but fortunately, that didn't turn out to be the case. I wouldn't exactly call it a masterpiece, like some people do, but I think I can say it comes close, and I would describe its predecessor the same way. I don't know about the TV adaptations of Of Mice and Men, which obviously aren't as widely available as the two theatrically released ones, but if you're a fan of the book, I really think the 1939 and 1992 versions of the story are both worth viewing.
