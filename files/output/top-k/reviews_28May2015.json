It it was all done without kung fu, explosions, spitting and eternal fighting like movies twenty years later. If only young filmmakers would imitate this masterpiece. Like ALIEN, the acting carries the film. This film's acting is beyond comparison; it has a great supporting cast featuring the always great William Sadler. People just will never understand that you must have character development with great villains like the warden from hell and Clancy Brown's captain of the guard; who is a walking refutation of Aristotle's idiocy that no one does evil for pleasure they only do it because they mistakenly believe it to be good. It starts so slowly building to a great denouement. The character development and the acting are what you want to watch this for; this is from a bygone era before we all went deaf trying to watch a film.The script is well written but without Freeman and Robbins the film would have failed. This is the film that made Morgan Freeman the Icon that he is today. Film buffs like me saw his potential in his earlier bit parts in BRUBAKER and STREET SMART. His performance is the greatest of his life; it dwarfs the overrated DRIVING MISS DAISY. This role is far more complex; he emotes with his eyes and body language with such ease. This is acting on the level of Marlon Brando. Again, the villains, the warden and the captain, will make you hate them so intensely you will love their just rewards at the end of the picture. Brooks, the librarian, such a little sub story within the picture shows, without being maudlin, the tragic fate of old prisoners who have forgotten how to function on their own. He utters one of my favorite philosophical axioms from the movie,Get busy living or get busy dying.This is why the film works James Whitmore a staple from Film Noir was always a powerful actor. Bob Gunton, no matter how bad the movie, i.e. BROKEN ARROW, is a villain you love to hate. Clancy Brown surpasses all his other roles as the sadistic captain who enjoys hurting people. The length of the film serves the script; the friendship between Andy and Red is the core of the picture. It grows very slowly as each get to know the other. Parents should be advised that like all of Darabount's films it pulls no punches with violent, graphic realism. The cruelty of the warden blended with his religion is of course a requisite for all films made after 1990. Nothing those NEW AGE bring the light Nazis demand more than all villains must be Christian religious fanatics. We know all these positive energy sending fascists are all paragons of virtue. I do not hold it against the movie; it is a sign of the intolerant tolerance crusaders and their hilarious hypocrisy. You will adore this movie. I watch it over and over. If you are religious like me, just remember they have to attack a morality because they have none and are filled with guilt. If it did not bother them so much they would not attack it so mercilessly; I think somebody is feeling badly about all the evil they are doing; what do you think?

Banking on their sole client, football player Rod Tidwell, Jerry and Dorothy begin to fall in love as they struggle to make their business work. There hasn't been such a elegant film quite like this one in such a long time.

Along his side is Cuba Gooding Jr. playing a football player named Rod Tidwell who is still intact with Jerry even with what's going on in his life, Cuba gave this Oscar winning performance as a charismatic person with lots of humor to fill the void with lots of respect and Encouragement. With all the ups and downs that Jerry is faced with, he still has the massive energy to get him through anything that comes in his path. You could call this film a comedy, romance or a sports film but mainly it sticks to the tone of a drama because what Cameron Crowe gave us was a man who is down on his luck and will do anything to not see himself fail no matter what kind of traits come his way, we are presented a man who you can actually relate too and root for.

These are the guidelines that should be followed when occurrences like this happen. Of course we all know that's rarely the case except for the few. Most money hungry studios end up taking the full reign of the production and end up demanding the final result being fairly an exact copy of previous entries made or drastically changed the concept itself. Thus leading to the trend of diminishing returns. For Clive Barker's Hellraiser (1987) franchise, the trend is mostly the same, except the issues are in other places this time.Compared to Hellraiser III Hell on Earth (1992), this entry doesn't really surpass it, but it does at least feel more on track than the prior one does. Originally Kevin Yagher (a make-up and special effects artist who had experience in other horror films) was set to direct as his debut film. Unfortunately, Miramax Studios, which then owned the rights fought with Yagher, causing him to quit. However, one man who hasn't left since Hellraiser II Hellbound (1988) was writer Peter Atkins, who once again penned the script. In this chapter, the year is 2127 and audiences are introduced to Dr. Merchant (Bruce Ramsay) an inventor who has discovered a way to destroy Pinhead (Doug Bradley) and his followers forever. Regrettably, he is stopped before he is able to finish by a group of soldiers who came to take him away. To stall time, Merchant convinces Rimmer (Christine Harnos) to listen to why he needs to finish what he was doing. The story Merchant tells is how the Cenobites were first released and how they connect to his family ties.The fact that Atkins went in even further than before to explain the back story to Pinhead and his origins is again commendable, but sadly this new information totally contradicts the three films before it. None of the main characters in the prior entries were related to Merchant, so why did their fate have them come in contact with Pinhead? Also what about the multiple boxes that Dr. Channard had in his office from the second film? If these boxes act as portals, what makes you think destroying one box will keep Pinhead out forever? It just doesn't add up. Along with that is a new pseudo-villain named Angelique (Valentina Vargas) who also has a past with Merchant, but only him. Of the characters in the story, the only people that matter and viewers will enjoy is Dr. Merchant, Angelique and Pinhead. Bruce Ramsay (who ends up playing different versions of himself) manages to at least be competent in his role and certainly more convincing than Terry Farrell from the previous movie. As for Vargas and Bradley, they both looked like they enjoyed their roles. Doing all kinds of evil acts and such.On the flip side, the rest of the cast is completely forgettable. There is no character development, not even for Rimmer who listens to Dr. Merchant. There's also a young Adam Scott and an older Kim Myers (from A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 Freddy's Revenge (1985)) and they too have no real significant importance. But aside from characters, Atkins did change a number of things for the better. One being the tone; the third movie had a completely different tone to that of the first two. Many fans took it as too goofy and cheesy where Pinhead was portrayed more as a generic slasher villain. Here, Pinhead still kills just cause, but he's not as blood hungry either. Another plus is the creativeness of the cenobite designs, which unlike the third film looked quite gimmicky. Here, they look more like what Pinhead's followers would look like. Then again, fans may also complain because there really isn't a lot of new additions. Throughout the whole film, only three new cenobites appear of which one wasn't even human and they also don't receive a lot of screen time. Along with that is a possible dislike for the smaller amount of gore too. With that it may not be as scary either.Yet, the kill scenes are still quite gruesome. Another interesting edition to the mix of the franchise is the use of CGI, which doesn't look that bad. It's used minimally which is how it should be used. The cinematography shot by Gerry Lively is a slight improvement over his work in Hellraiser III Hell on Earth (1992). This time instead of showing Pinhead in the sunlight all the time, he is kept in the shadows and this helps him feel more mysterious and dangerous. Finally for the musical score, Daniel Licht who would later be known for his music in the Dexter (2006) TV show composed the tracks. Thankfully, Licht exceeds Randy Miller's score from the prior film by adding new themes for the cenobites and making a variation of Christopher Young's original theme that was created from the first film. Much of these tracks use the same string build up, choral echoes and percussion but its the deviations that make it more appealing to listen to than recycled tracks.It still doesn't anywhere match the first two original movies and most will probably find it equal to that of the Hellraiser III Hell on Earth (1992) quality, but even for the production troubles that it had and nonsensical story telling, it can be a more entertaining watch. Although the likable cast is few, it is made up with more back-story, a better- written tone, appropriate costume design, acceptable special effects that don't look dated and a better film score.

Throughout the whole film, only three new cenobites appear of which one wasn't even human and they also don't receive a lot of screen time. Along with that is a possible dislike for the smaller amount of gore too. With that it may not be as scary either.Yet, the kill scenes are still quite gruesome. Another interesting edition to the mix of the franchise is the use of CGI, which doesn't look that bad. It's used minimally which is how it should be used. The cinematography shot by Gerry Lively is a slight improvement over his work in Hellraiser III Hell on Earth (1992). This time instead of showing Pinhead in the sunlight all the time, he is kept in the shadows and this helps him feel more mysterious and dangerous. Finally for the musical score, Daniel Licht who would later be known for his music in the Dexter (2006) TV show composed the tracks. Thankfully, Licht exceeds Randy Miller's score from the prior film by adding new themes for the cenobites and making a variation of Christopher Young's original theme that was created from the first film. Much of these tracks use the same string build up, choral echoes and percussion but its the deviations that make it more appealing to listen to than recycled tracks.It still doesn't anywhere match the first two original movies and most will probably find it equal to that of the Hellraiser III Hell on Earth (1992) quality, but even for the production troubles that it had and nonsensical story telling, it can be a more entertaining watch. Although the likable cast is few, it is made up with more back-story, a better- written tone, appropriate costume design, acceptable special effects that don't look dated and a better film score.

The move powerfully shows the imminent danger caused by the increasing destruction of the Amazon forest. Boorman does an excellent job showing the lives of the native Indians and their ability to live in harmony with the forest, contrasting it against the white man's careless and harsh way of destroying the forest to make clearings. The Emerald Forest does a wonderful job showing the need for environmental justice. The metaphor used by the Invisible People, in calling the white men Termite People, was very powerful. It serves as a perfect example of how the white men chews down trees. The scenes of the Invisible Peoples intimate contact with the forest and animals around them was powerful. They live as one with the forest, both helping each other. Tommy is one the most powerful characters in the movie as he successfully serves as a bridge that connects the outside world with the Invisible People. The movie could have been better if it showed more of the Invisible People's daily lives, more of their interaction with their world. It could also have showed more of the effects the loss of forest had on the Indians, how the Indians lives changed when they were forced to live in the city. The most important scene in the movie was when the Invisible People's women were taken into the city and forced to wear clothes. It seems completely different and unnatural. The huge contrast of the Invisible People's way of living strongly advocated for the preservation of the forest. The main character, Tommy, as a young boy was taken by the Chief of the Invisible People to save him from the Termite people. The Invisible People calls the white man the Termite people because they chew away the grandfather trees and destroys the forest. Like their name, the Invisible People is able to live in perfect harmony with the earth, leaving nothing behind and never taking more than they need, thus leaving the forest the way it were; as if they had never been there. For ten years, Tommy grows up among the Invisible People, learning their ways and truly becomes one of them. Meanwhile, tommy's family never stopped looking for him. During their search, Tommy's mother came into contact with an overflowing number of abandoned children, leading her to start to help them. Using the arrow shot at him during Tommy's abduction, Tommy's father was able to deduce that the tribe who took him is called the Invisible People. During this time, Tommy undergoes a rite of passage and becomes a man. He then sees his spirit animal and goes on a quest to obtain the special rocks that produce the paint which allows the Invisible people to blend into the forest. Although the journey was extremely dangerous due to the strongly violent Fierce People who often attack the Invisible People, Tommy successfully reaches the rocks. Coincidentally, tommy's father arrives at the same place at the same time. Father and son immediately recognizes each other and together, they fend off the Fierce People and returns safely among the Invisible People.Markham, Tommy's father was harmed during this ordeal and rests up in with the Invisible People. Tommy, having successfully returned with prized stones, was hailed as a hero and accepted by Kachiri, a beautiful girl. Tommy and Kachiri have a courtship ritual and comes together. After recovering, Markham wants to take Tommy back to civilization, but Tommy adamantly refuses. Tommy convinces Markham to take the pipe and in doing so, Markham sees his spirit animal and understands the Invisible people better. Still, he insists on going back, because that is where he belongs. A group of the Invisible people help him go to the edge of the World, which is the end of the forest. On their way back, the Invisible people see smoke rising from their home, panicking, they race back to find their campgrounds destroyed and burned, several members killed, and all of their young women gone. The Fierce People had attacked while they were gone and had taken the women into the city to be used as prostitutes. After cremating the dead and drinking some of their ashes, they once again set out to rescue their women. They venture into unknown territory, filled with strange trees (electricity poles) and weird branches (barbed wires). The Fierce People are now armed with guns, which the Invisible People's bows and arrows are no match for. Tommy, desperate to get Kachiri back goes on a quest to find his father. Reaching far back into his memory, he remembers his house and he climbs several floors to reach his parent's apartment. With Markham's help they successfully rescue all the women. As they part ways, Markham tells Tommy of the dam, and how with its completion, more white men will come. Tommy, naïve and optimistic, believe that if they ask for heavy rain, the dam will be washed away. So they return to their home and ask the frogs to sing extra loud. Heavy rain comes for several days, resulting in a large flood.

This is no relation to Interview with a Vampire which was closely based on the book. Queen of the Damned is only loosely based on the original and there are some significant changes to the story and certain characters, even to the extreme of characters being left out completely.I myself am a huge fan of the books, but am also realistic enough to accept that the books contain such detail that they do not lend themselves easily to screen, except perhaps in the form of a film series such as The Lord of the Rings. So, as a stand alone vampire movie that is heavily influenced by the book, any grievances can be left outside.The film's story (spoilers!) in brief then, tells us about Lestat (Stuart Townsend), who has been at rest for decades but stimulated by the sounds of the time he rises, soon becoming the front-man of a successful metal band. Publicly admitting that he is a vampire and revealing vampire secrets within his lyrics soon draws the attention of the authorities, both of the living and the un-dead. It even wakes up the original vampire Akasha (Aaliyah), a very different creature to the rest of them, with near god like powers and an insatiable blood lust.We learn of Lestat's past life and of his creator Marius (Vincent Perez). We also meet a few of the other Ancients, namely Maharet, as the aunt of another main character, the Talamaskan Jesse who develops a fascination with Lestat. Jesse is the link the ancients have to the living but she soon becomes caught in the middle of the action.Marius therefore is a change from the book where he is not Lestat's creator, and the changes don't end there, however he is a compelling character and is well played by Perez. The plot is far from complex and has holes, but then it was never intended on being taken too seriously. Accept it for what it is and not what it isn't. It is not an accurate adaptation of the book to film, but as a stand-alone vampire movie inspired by it, what's left is a decent and entertaining vampire movie.The soundtrack of the movie is from Jonathan Davis of Korn, and other famous names from the industry including Maralyn Manson feature so the movie gives a very credible musical contribution from what is ultimately a fictitious rock band. This aspect is worth consideration after all, as if it had not been good, this film could have stunk!

","genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"28 May 2015","score":"","review":" The low score on here is not from a majority of 5\/10 scores given by viewers after watching a borderline bad movie but much more a reflection of how passionately Anne Rice fans feel about somebody altering the content of their beloved Vampire Chronicles. This is no relation to Interview with a Vampire which was closely based on the book. Queen of the Damned is only loosely based on the original and there are some significant changes to the story and certain characters, even to the extreme of characters being left out completely.I myself am a huge fan of the books, but am also realistic enough to accept that the books contain such detail that they do not lend themselves easily to screen, except perhaps in the form of a film series such as The Lord of the Rings. So, as a stand alone vampire movie that is heavily influenced by the book, any grievances can be left outside.The film's story (spoilers!) in brief then, tells us about Lestat (Stuart Townsend), who has been at rest for decades but stimulated by the sounds of the time he rises, soon becoming the front-man of a successful metal band. Publicly admitting that he is a vampire and revealing vampire secrets within his lyrics soon draws the attention of the authorities, both of the living and the un-dead. It even wakes up the original vampire Akasha (Aaliyah), a very different creature to the rest of them, with near god like powers and an insatiable blood lust.We learn of Lestat's past life and of his creator Marius (Vincent Perez). We also meet a few of the other Ancients, namely Maharet, as the aunt of another main character, the Talamaskan Jesse who develops a fascination with Lestat. Jesse is the link the ancients have to the living but she soon becomes caught in the middle of the action.Marius therefore is a change from the book where he is not Lestat's creator, and the changes don't end there, however he is a compelling character and is well played by Perez.

Shot over the course of twenty-four countries on six continents in only a fourteen month period, Fricke captures some of the most immaculate images of the Earth, showing it, its people, and its natural beauty all in one richly photographed film. At only ninety minutes, this is a film with an impact guaranteed to hit you harder and harder after the credits roll.Fricke takes a look at numerous corners of the Earth, particularly the impoverished ones, with several individuals struggling to survive or forging a method of surviving in the tumultuous lands where they reside. Fricke photographs the wildlife, the communities, and the precious landscapes that exist in these areas, in addition to showing landmarks like the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, Lake Natron in Tanzania, tribal celebrations in Kenya, and even monks gathered in a monastery.It's fair to assume that Fricke is tired of seeing staged events of human life, or even exhausted from hearing shortchanged and ignorant remarks about people from other walks of life. Just by looking at what he decided to capture for the film, and how he wanted to edit it together, shows a person that is incredibly in-tuned with life around the world and appreciative of the Earth's natural beauty. However, Fricke doesn't dare neglect what he feels has made the Earth flawed. In one interesting sequence, Fricke juxtaposes factory-life with ordinary life in the city, at first showing employees in a cigarette factory and a countless number of baby chickens on a conveyor belt, waiting to be processed, and finally showing the society that embraces such things as cigarettes and freshly cut\/prepared poultry.I watched Fricke's followup to Baraka, Samsara, a few years back, and was absolutely marveled by many of the same features this film bears impeccable natural beauty, a consistent tone and flow despite no narration whatsoever, divine cinematography, and one-of-a-kind sights and sounds. One of Samsara's many extractable morals was that the Earth is so complex and richly detailed and layered that it took many years to perfect and create to reflect the life we know in present day. Through numerous shots of calamity and destruction, however, we saw how that film detailed that something so beautiful and complicated could be demolished or lessened in an instant.After watching Baraka, I can see how that idea was kickstarted. Fricke has no qualms about examining the ugly with the beautiful, or even finding a complex middle ground along the way. With this kind of layeredness, the film is prevented from being one you can view from only one way. Baraka is a free-form, impressionistic film with some of the most striking photography ever committed to film.

It does have a good shortcomings, that are thankfully outweighed by the many things that are delightful.Starting with what didn't come off so well, the story is as thin as a wafer and occasionally loses momentum when there's no singing or dancing. The script is very commonplace, and while it mostly flows well, reads well tonally and has entertaining moments some of the comic moments fall limp and it's cringe-worthingly stereotypical in places(i.e. Keenan Wynn's slang). The songs and choreography are top notch, but the (slightly) clumsily staged finale was an exception. Two performances don't work. Peter Lawford has to work with a dully written character that often felt incidental to the plot, and he brings very little personality or charm to it. Even worse is Sarah Churchill, she is incredibly wooden here and doesn't ever look comfortable with what she's given. Her chemistry with Astaire completely lacks warmth, and veers on non-existent on occasions.The production values are very colourful however, not quite lavish but very beautiful nonetheless, and the photography shows adept technical skills and very good attention to detail. The songs are great, with three being particularly memorable. One is the Oscar-nominated Too Late Now, which has a lot of emotional resonance and is performed with just as much by Jane Powell(though maybe Judy Garland may have given it more heft if she was cast). Two is How Could You Believe Me..., which benefits from some of Lerner's funniest and cleverest lyric writing and a genuinely easy-going natural chemistry between Astaire and Powell. Last is the infectiously catchy I Left My Hat in Haiti. The choreography is even better, there is so much energy and sparkle to it and the two highlights both feature Astaire and are among his best and most iconic. One being Sunday Jumps, with the most inventive use of a duet with a hat-rack you'll ever find in a film, and the other being his dancing on the walls and ceiling in his hotel room in You're All the World to Me which is the epitome of jaw-dropping.Royal Wedding may not be perfect in the writing department, but it's not too slow-going(even those bits lacking momentum don't hurt the film that badly) and has an endearingly light-footed, good-humoured(though not always) and warm-hearted quality, in a way also that often entertains and never talks down. So while there are flaws in the writing, the spirit and tone are just right. The characters are not too original and Lawford and Churchill's are not interesting at all, but the rest of the characters are very likable and engaging. Stanley Donen's direction is very accomplished technically and in terms of pacing and balancing everything is very assured also. The performances on the whole are fine, Keenan Wynn is amusing and Jane Powell is a more than worthy partner for Astaire and plays her role with plenty of attractive spunk and graceful charm. But it is Astaire who is the main reason to see the film, he was one of the dance world's greatest and one of the all-time greats at interpreting songs in musicals. While he didn't have the best voice in the world, though it was still an above-pleasant one, his dancing is masterful and he exudes complete confidence.Overall, has shortcomings and falls short of being great(like it could have been considering it had Astaire and was directed by Donen).

But these shortcomings are far outweighed by the good things, and the good things are delightful and a good many. 7\/10 Bethany Cox ","genre":"Comedy, Musical, Romance"},{"date":"28 May 2015","score":"7 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" 'The Good' is sharp-shooter Blondie (Clint Eastwood), although how someone who runs a bounty racket, betrays his friend, and shoots numerous people dead can be deemed good is beyond me.

That leaves cold-hearted killer Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef) as 'The Bad', which he most definitely is, even going so far as to kill a child in order to achieve his goals.

Where the film doesn't fare quite so well is in the pacing and storytelling, the basic plot&#x97;three guys go in search of hidden treasure&#x97;stretched painfully thin, particularly in the Extended Cut, which clocks in at approximately three hours. The expansive historical backdrop&#x97;the American Civil War&#x97;frequently detracts from the flow of the story and Leone has a tendency to labour a little too much over his style, lingering on his characters for an eternity and repeating similar shots ad nasueum, all of which causes scenes to drag. Fortunately, some nice touches of humour and a couple of neat plot twists help to make matters a little easier to digest.6\/10.

No man-to-man touching, only woman & man touching. I thought he was such a silly man to get involved with Maurice in the first place! Hugh Grant did a good job on playing a young man with a very strong posh accent!!I loved how the gatekeeper Alec Scudder just immediately fell in love with Maurice from the day he walked into Clives mansion. It just gives you that happy feeling that there will be always another light at the end of the tunnel. I'm so happy both reunited at the very end and lived happily ever after!I was so glad to see the two legends Simon Callow and Helena Bonham Carter appeared in this film.

In fact, the whole cast is really superlative. But no matter how skillful the cast, however, you're not going to get very far if the screenplay is not absolutely first-rate &#x96; and that it is! True, I thought the script's central idea was a bit overdone in places and put too much strain on credulity (e.g. the car plunging off the cliff and bursting into flames), but more than 90% of the time, the narrative does hang together rather well, despite the script's occasional attempts to undermine credulity. Of course it's an idea that Hollywood has used before, but previous versions have not explored its implications as cleverly as this riveting scenario. It's Murray's film. In fact, he is on the screen continually from go to whoa, but he handles the role so cleverly and with such charisma that it's not until is all over that we realize how adept he has been at disguising his continual presence and allowing some of the other actors, like the gifted Andie MacDowell, a few moments center screen.
