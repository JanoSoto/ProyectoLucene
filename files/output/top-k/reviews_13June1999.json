Some of the jokes were also WAY too re-hashed from the first one (the shhhh scene just isn't as funny anymore), and the product placement was nauseating. A shame that Elizabeth Hurley wasn't kept for more than her two-minute-appearance, though Heather Graham is good as Felicity Shagwell, Hurley had a real chemistry with Meyers (and is shaggadelically beautiful as well....)All in all, this film was INCREDIBLY funny, but I still suggest re-watching the first to see how truly original it was.

Then as it went along, I realized it was talking about totally different destinies. This movie really made me think. It would make anyone think! It's a fabulous movie! One split second can mean a lot in life! But it all comes down to the same exact thing. It just depends on which road you take to get there. Life is so weird, yet so exciting. Like my mother always says, What's rightfully yours, will eventually be yours. What's not rightfully yours, will never be yours. One split second can make so much difference!This movie is a must-see! It is the best movie out there! Nice script. Nice actress. Nothing could be better! I love it! Excellent job!PEACE OUT!

While it's true that Audrey Hepburn's singing was dubbed by Marnie Nixon, she delivers a strong, although not solid performance.  While some of her lines, especially towards the end, seemed artificial, I still sympathized with her. Sir Rex Harrison, the original stage Henry Higgins, performs as well as always here.  His fast-paced, dialogue-packed songs are as loaded as gunfire and very entertaining. Alfred P. Doolittle, the dustman, is a timeless favorite, and his Little Bit O' Luck and Get Me to the Church on Time numbers are whimsical and natural. While My Fair Lady is considered a romance, as so many big-budget film musicals were at the time, you'll see not a single kissing scene or anything really that romantically inclined.  Bernard Shaw's play, Pygmalian (which upon the movie is based) is a metaphor for the artist who falls in love with his creation.  In this case, Higgins is the creator, Eliza, the flar garl turned princess, his creation.  Whether it is truly love he eventually feels for her or pure admiration, it's hard to say.  But ultimately the film is almost three hours of innocent fun.

After all, they never expected you to take this film seriously. From the very beginning, when you see classic Star Wars introduction (praising their summer of 1999 competitor at the box office), they're telling you This is a silly film. And they're proud of it.Yeah it's true It's not as funny as the original, and the Austin Powers routines start to get quite old, but ironically, the villain saves the day in this film. While the first movie was about Powers, this one is about his nemesis Dr. Evil. This character (also performed by Myers) delivers the best lines of the movie. I could even dare to say that is worth watching just because of Dr. Evil. That good was he.On the other hand, the plot is not as fresh as the first. If you were a fan of the original's bathroom humor you won't be disappointed Overall, a good time at the movies, some good laughs and some very disgusting moments (almost to the point of getting disturbing). Can be a slight disappointment if your expectations are high, but not as disappointing as the competitor they're praising. Shagadelic, but thanks to Dr. Evil.

Coming in with little to no expectations, I was elated to sit back and actually watch a good old fashion romantic tragedy unfold.  The Quinn brothers (Aidan, Paul, Declan) should be immensely proud of this hard won film achievement.  It was a treat to watch. James Caan stars as a emotionally distant man who has little information on his past, more specifically, on who his father was.  He travels to Ireland with his nephew to find his roots.The film is really a triumph of writing and acting.  Aidan Quinn, who stars as the farmboy, gives his most powerful performance ever.  After nearly sleepwalking through his entire career, it is this film that the actor truly digs deep and takes the audience through the wringer of emotions.  It's an astonishing performance and will be remembered at the end of the year.  Caan also brings something new to his table, restraint.  Newcomer Moya Farrelly shines brightly as the young mother to be.  I liked her spunk and her ability to make the role seem more believable than I suspect the page held. Director Paul Quinn has a steady eye for Ireland.  While we've all seen the small village life in that country many times before, Quinn has the ability to make it all seem new and fresh.  The screenplay isn't a joyous one.  It's rather dark but the emotional impact is shattering.  This is one solid movie in almost every way you can conceive.  I hope more Irish tales are on the way from the brothers Quinn. --------------- 9 ","genre":null},{"date":"13 June 1999","score":"9 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":"  I just wanted to do a fancy Irish jig after watching this film.
