It then went on to blow me away every time I saw it there after.Just when you think you found something wrong, it makes sense. The only thing wrong I found was in the scene when Neo gets the phone  from the Fed-Ex guy, you can see somebodies hand in back of him in the scene. I truly think this is the greatest movie ever made. Any one who says this movie is not good,not written well, or has bad acting in its is either jealous or couldn't follow the storyline and it fustrated them. Can't wait for the next two parts. I would love to see the movie go back in time to when they pulled trinity out of the matrix. It would be cool to see her hacker years.Larry and Andy are it.

A lot of Lenny Bruce's material in this film is vulgar and rude, but it's so brilliant. He makes Andy Kaufman's alter ego, Tony Clifton, look like Mr. Rogers.And it's not just that his jokes are dirty, it's that they're dirty and poingnant. His comments about racial injustice, sex, (our preoccupation with sex), drugs, and marriage are all right on the mark.The film is brilliantly directed by Bob Fosse. Fosse has a way of making you feel as if your in the film. (similar to Run, Lola, Run). You feel Hoffman's pain in this film. You think Lenny Bruce is the greatest.And look at that He is.
