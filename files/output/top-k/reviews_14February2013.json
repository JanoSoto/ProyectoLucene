And just so we're on the same page... a legitimate feel-good flick makes you Love the main characters so much that you laugh, cry, hug & cheer along with them, while giving you a satisfyingly good ending.A Knight's Tale really takes a new approach to medieval that makes it quite original in many aspects, while still sticking to the expected- happy-ending so you don't leave it feeling heartbroken. Positives --- Sossoman, Ledger, Sewell, Purefoy & Bettany are all in the same movie !!! *whew* Thank you genius casting director! --- Soundtrack with Queen & Bowie mixed with medieval sports is just a lovely & quirky combo --- Has a genuinely happy ending that leaves everybody satisfied with no loose ends --- Unexpectedly original, but still rom-com type banter --- R. Sewell plays such an awesome bad guy --- Heath Ledger gets to be a pretty boy again! *sniff* --- Heath & Shannyn have a legitimate chemistry throughout --- Proof that chivalry is still sexy --- Paul Bettany is seriously at his best; adore his character! He finally gets a chance to show off his superb acting skills instead of being just a voice (like he is with Jarvis in Iron Man...) He is seriously underrated. --- Has a moral basis that leaves a viewer with warm fuzzies (just to reiterate it's feel-good-ness!)No Negatives really! It's hard not to love.****************** SPOILER BELOW **********************Favorite Heart-warming sceneWhen the blind father gets to see hug his son again! Christopher Cazenove's performance was so believable & overall heartwarming. It's hard to believe that in reality Heath (William) and Chris (Father\/John) are both dead within 2 years of each other!

Proof our culture still has a brain. D So...gender equality = treating both genders with respect & not violating their rights (in a nut shell.) So why then, do we allow raping a man chained to a bed??? ...Really people?This movie tries to make us believe that a) Men cannot control their sexual urges b) Forcing yourself sexually on a drunk, sleeping person tied to a bed (against their will) is OK (as long as it's a man!) Rape is only legitimate if a man rapes a woman apparently... (!?!?) c) Abstinence is torture \/ Life without sex is meaningless ... blah blah blah d) Respecting people's bodies is overrated Literally everybody should re-watch the ending if they didn't find it disgusting. Men, women, virgins, individuals with healthy sexual lives..... ALL OF US ... should be upset with how blatantly ignorant the ending of this movie is! He's raped 3 minutes before midnight?? That's your idea of an ENDING?!? This seemingly humorous rom-com kills the basic idea of respect & basic human dignity. Instead it aims to.... demonize celibacy, make men into brainless & sexualized pigs, make women into pretty\/sexualized objects, & ignore rape. So a more objective rating would go like this....(Positives) -- Main actors are talented --- Humor is consistently good -- Original date ideas & non-cliché type characters --- Plot isn't TOO predictable --- Refreshing to see Sossamon's edgy style as the lead role --- Male protagonist respects women --- All the apartment decor looks like a sexy bohemian Pinterest board(Negatives) --- Male rape is basically deemed illegitimate. The climax of this film occurs when the ex-girlfriend sneaks into his house when he (main character) is trying to remain abstinent & she forces him to have sex with her while he's DRUNK, SLEEPING & CHAINED TO A BED. (He says NO!) The writer's cover it up by letting him get the good girl in the end & never recognizing that the ex she-beast raped him. Apparently male rape does Not exist in the planet of these scene writers?!--- Excessive use of boobs. I didn't know it was possible to allow that many pointless boobs in one scene. --- There just HAD to be the cliché priest-who-has-excessive-sexual-urges character. Seriously? When is Hollywood going to get bored of saying that celibate people can't be celibate if they want to? A priest is statistically less likely to have sex\/ rape \/ molest a person than a child's teacher or parents!! ... Hollywood needs to stop rubbing this false holy- clergy-sex-fantasy stereotype in our faces.Movies like this are why male rape is under-reported & under-punished. Our culture needs to stop saying that only women can be raped. The idea that being raped somehow makes you more feminine or not tough enough to fight them off is ridiculous. The reality is that the crime of Rape is a violent act committed against a person (against their will)...regardless of the victim's gender! Women rapists (or men raping men) shouldn't be getting away with this!!!!!Seriously...--- OK... End Rant! loll ---Gave it 4 stars because the movie COULD have easily been a 7 or 8 star edgy sexualized Rom-com if it hadn't been for the writer's making rape illegitimate & the random stereotyping.

The acting is simple, but sincere and adorable in certain cases.One of the scene, when they announce they're getting married, is the perfect example of the quality and tone of the film.
