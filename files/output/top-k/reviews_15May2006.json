Being a student currently in high school, i am aware of some of these details and i have seen some of them. This movie also shows that teachers are not as good as people think that they are. They are humans too, and they also make mistakes and do the wrong things. This is shows my Mr. McAllister by crumpling up 2 of Tracy Flicks votes in order for her to lose.

Dick Tracy is filled with big names like Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Madonna, Paul Sorvino and even James Cann, Kathy Bates and Dick Van Dyke in a couple of small roles. The film was produced by Art Linson and Barrie Osbourne, who also produced such films as Heat, Fight Club, The Matrix and The Lord of the Rings and features a smashing score from Danny Elfman who previously scored Tim Burton's Batman and later scored Sam Raimi's very comic bookish Darkman. Elfman is pretty much the go-to-guy for comic book movie scores, having also done two Batman films, two Spider-Man films and The Hulk.Beatty does a good job as Tracy, but the real marvel of acting has got to be Al Pacino, covered in make-up and supporting a back hump as Big Boy Caprice. He tears into the role and really chews it up, going wildly over-the-top; constantly yelling and shouting at everybody. The tone of the film seems like a slightly revamped old school style film-noir, using traditional yet exciting scene transitions, dramatic lighting and set designs. Which reminds me, if Stanley Kubrick had ever decided to do a comic book film I think this is what it might have looked like. Visually it's a great film. It's only sixteen years old, gosh has it really been that long? Boy I'm starting to feel kind of old. The look of the city is done in what I think must have been extensive matte paintings, or possible models, but I don't think the film used that many computer effects, because in the early nineties or possibly the late eighties (when this film was probably made) CGI wasn't quite that widely used, and was only made much more popular after Terminator 2.The film is about Dick Tracy's battle to keep the streets safe from gangster thugs and Big Boy who has made a move to become the city's biggest crimelord, while at the same time a night club singer known as Breathless Mahoney (only in the movies or comics are people called such crazy names) played by Madonna, tries to seduce Tracy, but all he wants from her is to testify in court against Big Boy, who has recently taken over the club she sings at. Then things get really complicated when Tracy's girlfriend, Tess Trueheart (again, only in the movies) is kidnapped and is framed for murdering the city's District Attorney, landing the cop in the slammer.Dick Tracy is a well acted, visually glamorous and stupendous movie-going experience that's a fun throw back to old film-noirs and jazzy detective yarns filled with blazing tommy guns and screeching tires. I loved it! And I wished they'd make more movies like it, but I guess in some ways you could argue that they are making a bit of a come back, like with last year's Sin City for example, but instead of splashes of color here and there, Dick Tracy is an overwhelming tidal wave of color, and it sweeps you up off your feet and away.

Perhaps too, America was not quite ready for a satire of this nature delivered by such a well known director.Given, this is before Griffith had his much successful show. However, one can not deny that this type of indictment on the media may not have gone over well at the time. It was ahead of its time and holds up incredibly well, both in its purpose and its performance.Face in the Crowd is quite simply about how a drunkard by the name of Lonesome Roads is discovered by a radio personality and receives heavy media attention, learns how to manipulate it and becomes something of a media spin doctor for a politician. It's part Network and part Wag the Dog. These are obvious connections that have been made before.It's the little intricacies that really show how well thought out this movie is, however. An example is a scene where Griffith's character is asked to put a spin on a fad drug, where he suggest to advertise the drug's ability to help one's love life. Relevant today? You betcha! Besides looking at this film as an excellent piece of social criticism, it's just purely an excellent film. Andy Griffith was a new face on the scene and if audiences had seen him as the lovable Mayberry sheriff before this, people would be more in tune to what a wonderful performance this is. Griffith comes alive as he plays a down on his luck drunkard that embraces the media until we slowly see him self destruct. There is no denying Griffith's ability as an actor in this and had it not been for the politics behind this film and its maker, Griffith's career might have panned out differently.This is a movie about the media, the egos behind it, and how it shapes politics. The performances are top notch and direction superb. I can't recommend this movie highly enough. It serves as both an interesting social commentary and an excellent piece of film making.

Some times a book that is still alive in one's imagination doesn't compare well with what movie people can do to it; it can go either way. Fortunately, as in the case with this work, director Scott Hicks, who also helped to adapt it for the screen, shows a sensibility for the book as it shows in the finished product. The co-writer is Ronald Bass.The film is told in flashbacks. We are given the premise of the discovery of Carl Heine's body tangled in the nets and then the film goes into the trial in which the accused man, Kazuo Miyamoto, stands trial in spite of the fact he is an innocent man. Kazuo was a man that happened to be at the scene of the crime, but had nothing to do with what happened. His only guilt was trying to get back what had been the family's land from Heine.The film goes back to the time when Ishmael and Hatsue, who is now married to Kazuo, were childhood sweethearts. We see how inseparable they were and how they didn't stand a chance because they came from different ethnic groups. Hatsue's parents want her to stick to her own kind.Prejudice is shown as Japanese immigrants living in America were interred in concentration camps. This shameful page in the history of the United States changed forever the relationship between Hatsue and Ishmael. Kazuo went to fight in WWII on the side of his adopted country. Ishamel also goes to the conflict and suffers a loss of an arm during his time at the front.Ishmael, who is seen at the trial where he is reporting the process for his own newspaper, holds the key in solving the mystery. Even though he knows he will never have Hatsue back, he does the right thing in clearing her husband's name and his innocence.The film was shot in dark tones that renders the film with a sepia finish. There is not much color in Robert Richarson's splendid cinematography as he captures the bleak atmosphere of the different times shown in the movie. The editing of Hank Corwin works well in the movie. The musical score by James Newton Howard is an elegant compliment to the images one sees on the screen.Ethan Hawke's Ishmael has little dialog in the movie, yet, his expressions contribute to make his character a complex figure throughout the film. Youki Kudoh makes a beautiful Hatsue. Rick Yune plays the accused Kazuo. The great Max Von Sydow is seen as Kazuo's lawyer, the man who clearly understood what he was fighting for; he was an upright figure who opposed the prejudice and narrow mindedness of the small town. Sam Shepard, Richard Jenkins, Eric Thal, Arija Bareikis, James Cromwell and the others in the cast make valuable contributions to the success of the film.Ultimately, this is a Scott Hicks film and he proves he had a vision in how to stage the novel for us to rejoice.

Some times a book that is still alive in one's imagination doesn't compare well with what movie people can do to it; it can go either way. Fortunately, as in the case with this work, director Scott Hicks, who also helped to adapt it for the screen, shows a sensibility for the book as it shows in the finished product. The co-writer is Ronald Bass.The film is told in flashbacks. We are given the premise of the discovery of Carl Heine's body tangled in the nets and then the film goes into the trial in which the accused man, Kazuo Miyamoto, stands trial in spite of the fact he is an innocent man. Kazuo was a man that happened to be at the scene of the crime, but had nothing to do with what happened. His only guilt was trying to get back what had been the family's land from Heine.The film goes back to the time when Ishmael and Hatsue, who is now married to Kazuo, were childhood sweethearts. We see how inseparable they were and how they didn't stand a chance because they came from different ethnic groups. Hatsue's parents want her to stick to her own kind.Prejudice is shown as Japanese immigrants living in America were interred in concentration camps.

So many of these wild person movies have been done, from Tarzan to Crocodile Dundee, that we know what to expect of them...nothing believable, and nothing to learn from. Characters in other movies have been suckled by wolves, raised to swing from vines like apes, to fight crocodiles by the Australian Aborigines, raised by Indians and taught to dance with wolves, who knows what else? The only thing is, it could never happen. Raised by people in other societies, yes, but children raised without contact with any other people, it's impossible. Nell, if she had been living like the story has us believe, would have matted hair, filthy skin that was callused from head to toe, and she would be eating caterpillars and bark, not the groceries that were delivered to her door every week. And if the grocer knew where she was living, so would everybody else. Who pays the grocer? Why is she wearing shoes that fit? Why is her skin so soft and smooth? Why does her sister have to be an identical twin to make their own language...she could just as easily be a cousin. The thing that bothers me the most is that the average hillbilly in the mountains of North Carolina are much worse off than she is, and yet she is the one with new clean clothes and perfect teeth, while they are the ones with none. You want to make a movie about hillbillies in NC, then just go into the woods and film an average family in those hills, you don't need to drag Jodie Foster in with 25 makeup artists to hide blemishes. We have her in a cabin near a road that some local bikers have found. Are they the first people who ever stumbled on that cabin? The US government has surveyed every square inch of land in this country, and census takers know where every cabin or shack is. I have 28 acres in a part of the Adirondacks that are every bit as remote as the hills of NC, and when I tried sneaking a cabin in there, within a week I had the Town Officials up there wanting to see my permit.

I'm sure there were one or two funny things, but hell if I can remember. The matrix parody where Cindy freezes in mid-air is done extremely poorly.

Bad acting is not equal to comedy.

","genre":"Drama, Sport"},{"date":"15 May 2006","score":"7 out of 12 people found the following review useful","review":" A great potential come-back story that misses too many opportunities.Like, why did Harriet Bird (Barbara Hershey) shoot Roy Hobbs (Redford)? It was never made clear. That would have been a great sub-plot in itself. Say, she was his girl and was jealous of everything, and crazy to boot, and he didn't see it coming, and got it. Or something like that.Or a hint that Roy *could* have fathered a child with Iris (Glenn Close). There wasn't even a hint, like in Forrest Gump. And the fact that he was away for 16 years doesn't add up. The kid who we see at the end for too little time is about 10-12 years old. He should be 16-ish, which could have him as a budding, tough High School player. It would have been poignant if he was a true star player, and that Roy, whom we only fleetingly learn is his Daddy at the end, would come back to become his pitching\/hitting coach. But maybe I'm asking too much.And besides, this is the 30'-50's. A woman who has a child out of wedlock would have been a scandal. Why was this fact ignored? And it was strange that she didn't marry. Why? Was she in love with Roy all the time and was waiting for him to come back? That, too, was alluded to, but the point wasn't driven home, so to speak. And when she did find him, Glen Close's reaction was much too subtle and un-emotional for my taste. This is the father of her only child for crying out loud. So, cry out loud.And how and when did Roy make his decision to come back to play ball? This was quickly glossed over when Roy told Iris what had happened during the course of the 16 years apart, but it would have been dramatically worthwhile to see his epiphany of deciding to return.And just how does Memo Paris (Kim Basinger) jinx Roy and cause him to play poorly? Does she distract him? Did she out-and-out bribe him, or convince him? Did she take up so much of his time that he was quite simply exhausted? It's not clear at all.And when the Knights play poorly, they play like Little Leaguers. I mean, a team that plays like that just doesn't exist in major league ball. And not in AAA,AA,A, nor rookie ball. Now, I don't mean to get too technical here, but showing them playing like that is going overboard. They should have shown them playing OK, but there was a je ne sais quois missing. A mental push that helps them play truly top quality ball. And that mental inspiration is Roy Hobbs.Now, it was made clear that he inspired the team to improve, no question about it. And it was made clear that Bump (Michael Madsen) the right-fielder, was throwing the game, being bribed by The Judge (Robert Prosky).So, I agree with Roger Ebert in this case. It is a movie about idolizing Robert Redford, and it has very little to do with baseball.

In Schindler's List it certainly does. This movie is one of the classic movies of all time and is a must-see for any movie fan. It gives its reader a harsh image of the Holocaust while still respecting the people who were affected by it. While this movie may not be an enjoyable one, it is certainly a very important one. It is beautifully directed, amazingly acted, and heart-wrenching to the core. I highly recommend this movie. It is not just a movie; it is a journey for its viewers.The movie begins by showing us a typical Jewish family in hiding. They are celebrating Passover. We see them light the candles, and then they disappear, never to be seen again. Our protagonist is Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a man with incredible charm, but truly he is a bit of a swindler. We see examples of this in the movie many times, including when Oskar gives two wealthy men an expensive bottle of wine, giving him the chance to sneak in and dance with their gorgeous women accompanying them. Oskar sees that the Holocaust is opening a great opportunity to make a prosperous business by using the Jews as extremely cheap labor. Without knowing, Oskar keeps the Jews working for him completely safe from death. Soon his Jewish accountant, Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley), tells him that he is saving Jews from certain death.At first Oskar is hesitant, saying that he does not want to put himself at any risk. However, he receives a glimpse of the horror that the Holocaust is causing. Real people are dying and suffering and people are laughing at them. He decides that he must stand up for this travesty. He runs his factory, but only to keep the Jews safe. He even intentionally makes the production flawed. Nothing is gained in the factory except for lives. Soon the ghetto that the factory is in is closed and all the Jews are moved out.Schindler buys a work camp, sacrificing his own belongings. The story continues on, and we see how a man can be so charitable. It brings us hope that one man can truly make an everlasting difference. At the end of our journey, we learn that Schindler's businesses after the Holocaust failed. Schindler gave his life to save over 1,100 Jews.This movie gives us a different definition of the word 'hero.' Schindler was not exactly a perfect man. He conned other people to get what he wanted. His strength was in swindling other people. However, instead of using this talent for bad, he used it to save lives. He chose the harder way instead of the more pleasurable way, and that makes him a hero. Although swindling is not exactly a great thing to do, Schindler shows that it is good to use at times, as did Robin Hood when he stole from the rich in order to help the poor.This movie is incredibly depressing, and will haunt its viewers for a long time. The real life events will be shocking and disturbing for others, but they must understand that this did happen. People were this cruel to others, and certain people actually helped. This movie will give you a shocked feeling. While watching the end credits, you will not be able to move. You will be astounded, confused, and heart-broken.Again, I highly recommend this movie to everyone over the age of 14. This movie is rated R for nudity, real life violence, and some strong language. You must decide if this movie is appropriate for your child, but I suggest you show him\/her this movie sometime during their life, for it is very important to watch.

Their father's death estranged them into believing everyone none white-protestant is scum. One night after winning a game of basketball, two blacks try to steal Derek's car in the middle of the night, Danny hears and tells his brother, who is the right out there with a gun in his hand. Where he kills one of them, and performs one of the most disturbing deaths in cinematic history to the other. Derek is put away to prison for three years, where he meets Lamont (Guy Torry, who gives an excellent performance) a black laundry worker who gives him a speech that makes him see that his beliefs were wrong. He returns from prison a changed man, but isn't pleased to see that his brother has followed in his footsteps. And is being brainwashed by Seth (The amazing Ethan Suplee) and shady gang leader Cameron Alexander (Stacy Keach). And Derek goes about to stop this.American History X is a mind blowing assault on the senses and the mind. And gives out a powerful message.

Also lookout for Ethan Suplee his performance as Obese, racist, basketball player is a very different role from the slow-witted Randy in My Name Is Earl, and is also outstanding.The films message is that racial prejudice is pointless and life is too short to hate people because of their skin colour, my hope and most probably the writers hope is that this message got through to some people.9\/10 Magnificent film, only thing that lets it down slightly is that it tries to hard to touch upon it's basis, but apart from that Incredible, definitely worth a watch.

American History X is one of those films.Set in Venice Beach, in the Neo-Nazi skinhead neighbourhood of LA. You have two brothers Derek (Edward Norton) and Danny Vinyard (Edward Furlong) whose father was killed putting out a fire in a black neighbourhood. Their father's death estranged them into believing everyone none white-protestant is scum. One night after winning a game of basketball, two blacks try to steal Derek's car in the middle of the night, Danny hears and tells his brother, who is the right out there with a gun in his hand. Where he kills one of them, and performs one of the most disturbing deaths in cinematic history to the other. Derek is put away to prison for three years, where he meets Lamont (Guy Torry, who gives an excellent performance) a black laundry worker who gives him a speech that makes him see that his beliefs were wrong. He returns from prison a changed man, but isn't pleased to see that his brother has followed in his footsteps. And is being brainwashed by Seth (The amazing Ethan Suplee) and shady gang leader Cameron Alexander (Stacy Keach). And Derek goes about to stop this.American History X is a mind blowing assault on the senses and the mind. And gives out a powerful message.

Things get a little out of hand when the local mob boss (played by Ben Gazzara, perhaps better known as The Big Lebowski's Jackie Treehorn) wants to fight. Luckily, Dalton has a friend... an old-time bouncer played by Sam Elliott.This film is mentioned as Dawson Leery's (from Dawson's Creek) favorite movie, which seems really odd for a character who emulates Spielberg. The film is non-stop fight scenes that extend into full bar brawls. Okay, wait, not non-stop... there's also a fair amount of sex. Sex and nudity (both male and female). You will see more of Sam Elliott than you ever thought you would. And then back to the fighting.The bar brawls were enough to earn it the title of Second Best Fight Movie Ever (behind They Live, though the choreography of Clockwork Orange is impressive) in my mind, but then the fights turn grotesquely violent. This is either a good thing or a bad thing depending on what you're looking for. I find this to be the selling point of the film, knowing that Dalton has the strength and training to rip a man's windpipe out through his neck. Yet, he has the cool calmness of a zen master (one wonders how his majoring in philosophy fits into his character... if at all).There are a few things that seem strange if you're being picky. All stores and houses are packed wall to wall with propane tanks apparently, as explosions happen for no reason. Cops don't show up for fires, bar fights or the destruction of an entire car dealership (by a monster truck). They do show up once in the film without being called, when their presence no longer matters.This is the kind of movie I can watch over and over and over again. Not because it's a great film (although it is pretty darn good)... but because its absurdity is, well, absurd. The film takes place in a universe I can only dream of. Which, being a late 1980s film, I guess makes it perfectly normal in some way. Well, whatever the case, I loved it and you should love it, too.
