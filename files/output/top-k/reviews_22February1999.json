It is not for those who are easily offended by language, or who cannot stomach the black humour often arising from the portrayal of human dysfunction.And we have more dysfunctional characters in here than you can shake a stick at, and most of the cast have had plenty of experience of playing them. Jane Horrocks (as Laura Hoff, aka Little Voice aka LV) cut her teeth in the wickedly funny but depressing Life is Sweet by Mike Leigh, who also scripted\/directed Brenda Blethyn (LV's slatternly harridan of a mother, Mari) in Secrets and Lies. Then there is failed theatre agent Ray Say, with Michael Caine reprising the misogyny of Alfie (and the weakness of the professor in Educating Rita). Ewan MacGregor (Trainspotting was about as dysfunctional as you can get, and he wasn't operating with a full deck in A Life Less Ordinary either!) appears as Billie, a slightly geeky telecom engineer with a pigeon obsession. Add Annette Badland (who she? Oh I know, she was Griselda Fishfinger in Jabberwocky) as Sadie, the varicose veined, non talking compulsive eater, and Jim Broadbent as sleazy Mr Boo the nightclub owner, and you have a real recipe for humour - but also for human torment.LV has been gravely affected by the early death of her father. Never venturing outside the house, and too timid and withdrawn even to answer the phone, she consoles herself by playing her father's favourite records, and learning to sing in the voices of the original artistes. Ray hears her singing to cover the racket Mari is making during the course of an attempted seduction, and figures that THIS is the big break he has been looking for all his life. LV at first will have none of it, but she is cruelly and ruthlessly manipulated by the villainous Ray into allowing herself to be put on the stage. Half dead with fear she fluffs it, but Ray persuades her to have one more try. On the brink of another failure, she sees and takes refuge in a vision of her father; she gives her performance everything she has and is sensational, only to collapse into near catatonia when the vision fades. Unable to even speak, she is serially reviled by Mari and Ray, who break into a fight about each other's failings. Much door banging and general bad behaviour ensues and, for reasons I won't go into, a fire breaks out. LV is stranded alone in her bedroom, singing her songs to keep the fire away.Throughout there has been a romantic subplot. There is some good gritty set and location choice (mainly in Whitby on the Yorkshire coast), and dingy lighting and camerawork adding to the general air of despair, aided by some really good direction. But it is not all doom and gloom - far from it. The humour is bawdy and hysterically funny - the scene where Mari and Sadie are dancing to Disco Inferno by Trammps had my wife and  me near weeping with laughter. And for the soft hearted (eg me), the portrayal of the developing trust and affection between LV and Billie is handled with exquisite tenderness and complete believability.The acting is universally good. Jane Horrocks puts on the performance of a lifetime, both as the young woman painfully preparing to grow out of her helplessness, and also as the variety of stars she impersonates. You will swear Marilyn Monroe has returned when you hear her - and no it wasn't dubbed.

And you can really admire Spielberg's way with composing shots to tell convery information-- and it seems so masterful and exciting, rather than the rather lifelessly formulized direction he gives things now (though I do remember being startled at certain shots in Amistad). You think Wow, he really was a very talented, personal filmmaker at one time. I feel like now he's become more of a public figure, afraid to offend anyone.I was also surprised 1) how masterful the scares are in the first half. Certain aspects of the aliens visits are very scary, and these scenes were terribly exciting. I still love the scene in which Richard Dreyfuss' truck is scanned by the ufo-- leaving him twitching with terror afterwards. The trademark Spielbergian sense of wonder really does seem scary\/wondrous here. 2) How real and nasty the scenes of domestic disintegration are. At one point Richard is saying to his wife I'm scared, just hold me while she's screaming I Hate you, that's why! It's really intense and shocking. And when Richard is playing with his mashed potatoes and looks up to realize his entire family thinks he's gone insane-- and his son starts crying at seeing him like that-- it's a scene that might be too intense in a flat-out tearjerker drama.The special effects are also amazing-- much more amazing, I think, than modern, computer-generated special effects, and I don't know why. Even when you can actually see lightbulbs and stuff-- the spaceships here really seem incredible. For some reason the realism and detail of modern computer generated spaceships seem very mundane by comparison. Here they found a way to make a bunch of lightbulbs seem really otherworldly-- now that you can show anything you want, I think a touch of that creativity and imagination has been lost.Also at the heart of this movie is a very sad story. Richard has a very self-centered wife who leaves him, then he hooks up with a similar looking but different wife figure. I think the key scene here is when he says to the surrogate wife I have to (leave you and) go down there (to the spaceships) and she says I know, and wishes him well, where his real wife would have said but what about me? It's in some ways about being trapped in a marriage with a person who inhibits your life and dreams, rather than encouraging you to pursue them. I'd be interested to know what was happening in Steve's life when he wrote this.Anyway, it's too bad people can't always see this on the big screen. It's so nice to watch a film all the way through without answering the phone or talking out loud, and it's wonderful to be with a big audience who is really into what the movie is doing to them.

He is just not convincing in this role and is made to look very ordinary when compared to the performances of the supporting players whose role in this film has been unfairly ignored. It is a sad day when Ted Danson makes a more convincing Army Captain than Mr Hanks.This is a good movie but it is not a classic. The battle scenes probably are the most realistic ever filmed but once they are over you are left with a fairly standard war movie with nothing new to say. Sure war is hell but if you have watched any war movie made since Apocalypse Now then surely you know that already. The view of war from the perspective of the common soldier has been done many times before, and in my mind much better in films such as Das Boot, Stalingrad and restoration. I hope that those who are so impressed with Saving Private Ryan take time to check out these films. I would also like to say that as a Brit I did not find the so called nationalistic tone of the film offensive. I don't think that it is an accident that the American Flags are shown to be pale and washed out. I think that this simple image is an  effective way of showing a pride in the American achievements in WWII whilst appreciating the tragic loss of life and perhaps an acknowledgement that atrocities were not just the preserve of the Germans. What I did find offensive was the insulting bookend sections which sledge-hammered the message home. Perhaps if Mr Spielberg reads the negative comments about these sections in the IMDB he might realise that we film goers have more intelligence than he gives us credit for and will stop using such unnecessary sentimental devices in his films. In general this film felt like a roller coaster where the biggest drop is the first one. It's exhilerating as hell at the beginning but then you never quite reach the same hights again and end up coasting to a disappointing end.

He is just not convincing in this role and is made to look very ordinary when compared to the performances of the supporting players whose role in this film has been unfairly ignored. It is a sad day when Ted Danson makes a more convincing Army Captain than Mr Hanks.This is a good movie but it is not a classic. The battle scenes probably are the most realistic ever filmed but once they are over you are left with a fairly standard war movie with nothing new to say. Sure war is hell but if you have watched any war movie made since Apocalypse Now then surely you know that already. The view of war from the perspective of the common soldier has been done many times before, and in my mind much better in films such as Das Boot, Stalingrad and restoration.

","genre":"Action, Drama, War"},{"date":"22 February 1999","score":"","review":"  Some films are just meant for the big screen and nothing else. ALIENS is one of these few treasures. I am a little tired of all this James Cameron bashing that has been going on since his Oscar cleanup and announcing his title of King of the world. If I staked any kind of pursuit on something I believed in that badly, and won when everyone else said I would fail, I would be laughing all the way to the bank too. You see that creativity and gift for entertainment come alive in ALIENS. Cameron has an uncanny gift for making his films run for a considerable timeframe, and makes them thoroughly captivating and riveting throughout their duration, never stopping for a breath. Titanic is like that, and so is Aliens. Aliens, in its last hour, is non-stop action and suspense, using techno-visuals to a vast extent and more energy than it knows what to do with it. Sigourney Weaver is great as Ripley, a heroine that doesn't take any crap from anyone, and does everything a man can do, only better. She also has a heart, which is evident in her perserverance in saving Newt (Carrie Henn). Paul Reiser is devious and slimy as Burke, far from his character on Mad About You. Bill Paxton is also a standout. If you have any brains at all, do not eat too heavily before seeing this film. You'll definitely not be able to hold it in. Rating Three stars and a half.

As a matter of fact, she's been in some of my least favorite movies of the decade (A FEW GOOD MEN, INDECENT PROPOSAL, THE SCARLET LETTER, THE JUROR, STRIPTEASE), and she really hasn't been good in any of those.  But she did win me over in this movie, because she lives up to her character's line, Look, I'm not trying to make any sort of statement here.  And she isn't.  Instead of letting vanity get in the way, or injecting pathos, she lets her actions speak for her, just like her character does in trying to win acceptance as a SEAL.  The haircut scene is a good example; though it's directed with cinematic flourish, she does it matter-of-fact.Moore's performance is one of the two performances that elevate this from your standard grunts-become-soldiers movie.  The other is the riveting Viggo Mortenson as the Master Chief, who's the drill instructor.  He doesn't play the role as a sadistic tyrant, but rather as a subtle manipulator who gradually recognizes Jordan O'Neill(Moore) is someone worth taking seriously.  He also avoids going for pathos.The movie is best when it concentrates on the training.  Ironically, making just a standard grunts-become-soldiers movie makes its message work, because like O'Neill's superiors, we take her seriously because she becomes no different than anyone else.  The beginning is bad, and the climatic battle at the end is overblown, which weakens the movie.  Still, it's worth a look, and I maintain Moore was only given a Razzie Award for this movie and performance because of her past work, and the naysayers really weren't paying attention to her performance here.
