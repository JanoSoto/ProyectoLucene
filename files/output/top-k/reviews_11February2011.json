This is definitely a one of a kind movie, that balances somewhere between a more art-house type of movie and a regular '70's thriller\/mystery.The movie also does work out refreshing due to its settings. This is an Australian movie, that is also being set in Australia. So next to its 'change' of settings, the movie also features some different from Hollywood type of characters.

The film tells the story about a young man, Perhan, in Italy with the special power of the Gypsies, handed down by his grandmother. He is able to use telekinetic powers, a power that gives you the ability to move objects from one place to another without touching them. The story follows his life as he falls into the world of crime in order to make quick money due to his struggle with poverty. He betrays his grandmother by involving himself in crime even though his grandmother never brought him up in that way. As many criminals, it takes loosing everything in order for him to realize that he is doing wrong. So he finally takes action towards all the betrayal involved with the crime scene. He uses his telekinetic powers to take revenge towards those who hurt him. Kusturica does a great job on introducing the Gypsy world to many people like me. Before watching this film I knew nothing about the Gypsies and now I at least understand the powers they contain. Kusturica also uses Magical Realism, the film technique that makes unrealistic things seem okay because it is part of the film's world, perfectly many times in this film. In example, early on in the story he has a tight relationship with his pet turkey. The turkey seems to understand everything Perhan says and all of Perhan's moods throughout the film. Perhan also moves objects with his telekinetic powers; even though it is obviously impossible you believe it can happen within the world of the film. This is a film that I recommend to all audiences.

Of course, this style is Eastwood's stock in trade, and many would have it no other way. I think most people find the Kostner parts of the movie far more complex and interesting, as I did, too. There are a host of other actors of some note, too, especially Laura Dern, who is meant to be a new kind of woman cop, but she actually gets pretty well stepped on and belittled by both Eastwoods (the actor and the director).So this ends up being a feel good movie of a not-so-rotten convict on the run and a sweet as heck boy who befriends him. The cops in pursuit are comical (on purpose) and the movie really is an entertainment above all, genuinely warm and funny in alternating sections.

A year later, I saw my first Christian Slater movie (though, almost immediately following, I watched &#x96; and not for him &#x96; Young Guns II) as well as a star I would fall in love with for thereafter Samantha Mathis, coincidentally, her first movie.I remember loving the movie, the idea, the setting &#x96; finally a teen movie that was set in my current location, Arizona, the mood, the dialogue, the music and definitely the message. What also impressed me was the nonchalant take they had on homosexuality and how the main hero, Hard Harry (Slater) was so accepting of it. (Side Note I hadn't come out yet by this point, but this certainly helped verses all the negativity surrounding the gay lifestyle I heard around me.)And as independent as this was, it was certainly far before it's time. Christian Slater really plays Mark, but, in what also appealed to me, by night his Clark Kent image of Mark was transformed into the Superman Hard Harry on a radio program on an unused frequency. What he was doing would be considered a podcast nowadays, only he went the long, and probably only, way around it.Literally, he didn't think anyone was listening. So this lonely kid, Mark, who was moved by his parents to a small Arizona town, babbles on the air about how bad the high school he was attending as well as the small town. Although, it sounds like he's complaining, he's actually hitting on some direct topics the parents and school board are either ignoring or were ignorant of.Well, the kids are listening, one by one, growing by the night. Namely, Nora (Mathis), the obvious Lois Lane of the trio of characters (if you count Clark and Supe as two), who's trying to find the identity of the voice she hears and absolutely agrees with. Oh, and is it obvious she's also in love with Hard Harry?A tragedy, one you might not expect with the direction the movie was headed, occurs and now Hard Harry's a target for parents, police, the FCC and of course the school board for what he's saying might actually be true.They all want him shut down. Naturally, all the kids want him to continue &#x96; he's their voice, each and every one of them. Only, Clark, er, Mark's conflicted and the much more shy version of Hard Harry.

I do this for nostalgia purposes, obviously, but re-watching this movie now, after not seeing it for probably 15+ years, it really holds up today.

Also, as mentioned, I did love (literally, I fell hard for) Mathis; she did a fantastic first job and bold &#x96; see well, her. Further, Slater equally did a excellent job. And the soundtrack remains as one of my all time favorites. I have probably listened to Everybody Knows by Concrete Blonde 660 times since this came out.This was the un-Hollywood independent film I will cherish for all time.

Sure, its not as great as the TV series, which is a considered a classic in my book ( and in most peoples books as well). But the movie is nowhere near as bad as everyone keeps saying it is. Its a movie that shouldn't be taken so seriously when watching it.The CGI steampunk spider is what most people claim to have saved the movie, but i disagree.I enjoyed the movies scenes in which the spider was not present ( my favorite scene was when Loveless's steam powered tank attacked the train). In fact i almost forgot about the spider while watching the movie for the 1st time. I especially got a kick out of Kenneth Branagh's acting as Dr. Loveless.I say Loveless was the best part of the movie. But that's not to say I enjoy the use of steampunk technology. I consider this movie to be an excellent use of the Steampunk style.I do admit, the acting is a bit over the top, especially Will Smith and Kevin Kline. But i did not think it was terrible or too cheesy like everyone says it is. It is kinda silly in some way, but overall i enjoyed both of them. I do admit though, Salma Hayek's acting was weak and made her character boring. Usually, i am against movie remakes of classic TV shows, but this is one i can agree with.

Its a movie that shouldn't be taken so seriously when watching it.The CGI steampunk spider is what most people claim to have saved the movie, but i disagree.I enjoyed the movies scenes in which the spider was not present ( my favorite scene was when Loveless's steam powered tank attacked the train). In fact i almost forgot about the spider while watching the movie for the 1st time. I especially got a kick out of Kenneth Branagh's acting as Dr. Loveless.I say Loveless was the best part of the movie. But that's not to say I enjoy the use of steampunk technology. I consider this movie to be an excellent use of the Steampunk style.I do admit, the acting is a bit over the top, especially Will Smith and Kevin Kline. But i did not think it was terrible or too cheesy like everyone says it is. It is kinda silly in some way, but overall i enjoyed both of them.

Yes, there's a cruel lack of warmth, of genuine love, of this very 'Family spirit' that cemented the iconic greatness of Part I but that's because the very purpose of the film is to show another kind of intimacy, the one between Politics, Business and Crime, as to highlight a sort of inner perversity in the American Dream. This is also why the film is regarded as an epic.In Part II, it's not a Five-Families-war that structures the plot anymore, so there's no need for this 'team spirit' anymore, we're far from the good old days with Sonny, Hagen, Tessio and Clemenza, when the Corleones were fighting for their survival. The bigger your territory gets, the more invisible is your enemy ... so invisible he can even be one of your own. Indeed, even the first film ended with a betrayal from Tessio, Vito's trustful capo-regime, a shock that foreshadowed the idea expressed by Michael in Part II, the fact that loyalty relies on business. What a world where you can't call your friends friends because they are only your associates but you still call your enemies enemies! What a world when your enemies have to be kept closer than your friends! And what a world when even your brother can betray you!Part II is a much darker film in its content because it plunges us in a world where there's no room for genuine and non-calculating people &#x96;after all, isn't one of the many things that make the first film more enjoyable the presence of such characters as Sonny- Even Michael has these words about Fredo, he's a good heart but he's weak and stupid, and this is life and death. Life and death indeed, the family expanded its power, becoming one of the wealthiest in Nevada, but it's not New York City anymore, it's time to deal with a new category of enemies, more dangerous because they are more respectable. The film opens with a conversation between Michael Corleone and Senator Geary, but this time the politician is not the criminal's friend, he not only despises him but explicitly affirms his intention to squeeze him.Michael's reply sets the tone of the film Senator, my offer is this nothing, he wouldn't feign legitimacy with a man who just asserted his moral corruption. If politicians and criminals play in the same arena business, then they'll play according to the rule of the strongest. Crime has ceased to be an underworld, on the contrary, it embraced the world, getting bigger than US Steel as Hyman Roth would say, in the name of making a profit that would go as far for legitimacy as pretending to serve a country's economy, Las Vegas, pre-Revolution Cuba, even be able to elect a new President. If Coppola was accused of romanticizing the mob in the first opus, no one can hold the same accusation against Part II, and the directing plays a significant role to that.Indeed, it's impossible to end the second film with the same level of fascination created by the magical moment where Neri shuts the door on Kay's face, and maybe that's why we still enjoy the first film, because it has this sort of 'happy end' feel, because we are still within the Corleone's inner circle and the good team won and could savor the victory behind the closed door. Michael became another man, even more ruthless than his father, but he was the Don in this 'underworld' context, so he can only inspire our empathy, if not our respect.But in Part II, crime, business and politics are all part of the same hypocrisy, and while Michael could count on the loyalty of Neri, Rocco, Hagen and even Fredo at the end of the first part, in Part II, he becomes aware that greed and thirst for power can triumph over the most loyal individual.... and if he didn't knew that before, the assassination attempt he miraculously escaped from, sent a clear message about it. So, while Part I established the necessity of a strong loyalty to overcome a clearly identifiable enemy, Part II highlights the illusory aspect of loyalty when it comes to an invisible enemy that can be on your own side, even your own brother, consequently leading to Michael's descent into paranoia.The first film was a consolidation of power, built on Family, friendship and loyalty, incarnated by the warmth and quiet strength of Vito Corleone, we find him again with the traits of Robert De Niro, in his Oscar-winning role. He represents the heritage of Michael Corleone, the proper use of power, of intelligence, of heart but the tragedy of Part II is to highlight the obsolescence of a figure like Vito Corleone in a world that got more blinded by greed and power, a world where Machiavellian intelligence was a more valuable asset than pure intuition and where even love and brotherhood could be reduced to sheer abstractions. Times have changed and Michael realized that the time of his father is over, and that he can indeed lose his family. The tragic irony is that he lost it by trying to preserve it.The second film deconstructed all the values that its glorious predecessor stood for to draw a dark, gripping and harrowing portrait of Crime, incarnated by the cold and ruthless eyes of Michael Corleone, Al Pacino in what I believe to be one of the all-time greatest performances. It's thought-provoking, it's even more realistic, but maybe we blame it for not being 'more enjoyable' than the first film, more romantic I mean. For me, it's perfect the way it is.

The movie Shows the Rise and Fall of the Great Charles Foster Kane, It shows how his life really was , how he never wanted money for himself, how he was Both Bad and good at the same time. The Movie has amazing amount of depth in it, But still the movie is not without it's flaws, The Biggest Flaw of the movie is how it is shown and at the same time that same thing is its biggest Strength. The Movie is Somehow Dark and Dirty, Where Many like my self will love the movie, many will find it to be boring and out of pace.

Kusturica's use of magical realism gave this story such a lyrical, poetic and passionate feel, that at times I felt as if I was lost in a dream.

However, after a short time my eyes were opened to the immorality and selfishness that completely dominated the industry. In the end, I decided that if I wanted to preserve my true passion for music, I would have to remove myself from this corrupted world before I became like them.

The Doctor (Robert The Doctor Picardo on Star Trek Voyager) is the sex-crazed werewolf, Eddie, that sets the whole movie into motion?OK, that reveals that I am a die-hard Voyager fan, but it also states how this movie keeps impressing me after all these years.A lot of avid werewolf fans love An American Werewolf in London when I barely liked that feature. Picture it I was a kid, I had little patience. Okay, I still have very little of that quality but I needed to see the werewolf and soon or I would be busting at the seams. And American simply takes too long &#x96; especially when the man becomes a&#x85;DOG.So, I always loved and was always faithful to (the original and you better stay, STAY far away from the sequels) The Howling because it gets me what I wanted the most the anti-dog (stand-up) werewolf and quicker.Unfortunately, I realized something with this viewing This movie ALSO takes a bit to get to the goods. There's an enormous set up that I had (as an adult now) little patience for, as well. The problem is the version I watched over&#x85;and over&#x85;as a kid, was the edited TV version.When I watched this now, it was the DVD, with nothing edited out and it took more than half the relatively short horror flick to produce the werewolf. Now, that said, when it did appear, it was Fantastic. So much for the CGI of today that literally mocks what a real (meaning, what I consider to be a MAN-WOLF, a standing man who turned into a wolf) werewolf looks like.What we have here is News Anchor, Karen (Wallace &#x96; later known as Wallace-Stone) is investigating brutal attacks and agrees to meet Eddie who readily attacks her while changing into a werewolf. She doesn't fully realize this as a rookie cop shoots and supposedly kills him.Shaken and stirred Karen agrees to a mountainside retreat under the guidance of Dr. George Waggner (Macnee) with her husband. Unfortunately, she's unwilling to partake in sex, and Marsha (Brooks) is. And unfortunately for Karen, her husband is willing to partake in sex&#x85;with Marsha&#x85;and a quick bite, transforming him into a werewolf.Scared, Karen calls her news station friend, Terry (Balaski) up who, along with her own husband, has been researching the beast within. Once it's realized this group of spiritual healers at the retreat aren't up to actual healing, it's time for heroism, escape and the story of the century.The reason I realized this is not my favorite werewolf movie is because, frankly, Jack Nicholson's Wolf, is actually an overall better made film. While The Howling gave me everything I absolutely love about the myth of the wolf-man, i.e. a man that resembles a wolf, albeit a 6-foot-tall one, Wolf had better acting, story, dialogue, etc.That said, I will always cherish this film. It had comedy and a lot of tongue-in-cheek references (please tell me you noticed the dozens to other films.) And when the movie finally got going, half-way through, it was fierce.

The Doctor (Robert The Doctor Picardo on Star Trek Voyager) is the sex-crazed werewolf, Eddie, that sets the whole movie into motion?OK, that reveals that I am a die-hard Voyager fan, but it also states how this movie keeps impressing me after all these years.A lot of avid werewolf fans love An American Werewolf in London when I barely liked that feature. Picture it I was a kid, I had little patience. Okay, I still have very little of that quality but I needed to see the werewolf and soon or I would be busting at the seams. And American simply takes too long &#x96; especially when the man becomes a&#x85;DOG.So, I always loved and was always faithful to (the original and you better stay, STAY far away from the sequels) The Howling because it gets me what I wanted the most the anti-dog (stand-up) werewolf and quicker.Unfortunately, I realized something with this viewing This movie ALSO takes a bit to get to the goods. There's an enormous set up that I had (as an adult now) little patience for, as well. The problem is the version I watched over&#x85;and over&#x85;as a kid, was the edited TV version.When I watched this now, it was the DVD, with nothing edited out and it took more than half the relatively short horror flick to produce the werewolf. Now, that said, when it did appear, it was Fantastic. So much for the CGI of today that literally mocks what a real (meaning, what I consider to be a MAN-WOLF, a standing man who turned into a wolf) werewolf looks like.What we have here is News Anchor, Karen (Wallace &#x96; later known as Wallace-Stone) is investigating brutal attacks and agrees to meet Eddie who readily attacks her while changing into a werewolf. She doesn't fully realize this as a rookie cop shoots and supposedly kills him.Shaken and stirred Karen agrees to a mountainside retreat under the guidance of Dr. George Waggner (Macnee) with her husband. Unfortunately, she's unwilling to partake in sex, and Marsha (Brooks) is. And unfortunately for Karen, her husband is willing to partake in sex&#x85;with Marsha&#x85;and a quick bite, transforming him into a werewolf.Scared, Karen calls her news station friend, Terry (Balaski) up who, along with her own husband, has been researching the beast within. Once it's realized this group of spiritual healers at the retreat aren't up to actual healing, it's time for heroism, escape and the story of the century.The reason I realized this is not my favorite werewolf movie is because, frankly, Jack Nicholson's Wolf, is actually an overall better made film. While The Howling gave me everything I absolutely love about the myth of the wolf-man, i.e. a man that resembles a wolf, albeit a 6-foot-tall one, Wolf had better acting, story, dialogue, etc.That said, I will always cherish this film. It had comedy and a lot of tongue-in-cheek references (please tell me you noticed the dozens to other films.) And when the movie finally got going, half-way through, it was fierce.
