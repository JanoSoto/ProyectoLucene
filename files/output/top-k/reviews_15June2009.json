But an undeniable peak period for the genre was the thirties when Universal created a number of memorable screen monsters FRANKENSTEIN (1931), Dracula (1931) and THE MUMMY, (1932.) The Forties, on the other hand, was a low point that saw a trend toward low-budget programmers and uninspired sequels that culminated in a parody of the genre, Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948). There were a few high points, however, such as the atmospheric thrillers of Val Lewton (Cat People, 1942, The Body Snatcher, 1945). And the most popular horror film of the entire decade - The Wolf Man (1941), directed by George Waggner - added yet another frightening creature to Universal's gallery of monsters.Like Universal's earlier exploration of lycanthropy, WEREWOLF OF London (1935), Waggner's film drew upon European folklore and legends for inspiration and screenwriter Curt Siodmak fashioned an increasingly paranoid narrative around an American, Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney, Jr.), returning to his father's estate in England after an eighteen-year absence.According to the documentary on the Recent Wolf Man DVD collection, the script for The Wolf Man was influenced by writer Curt Siodmak's experiences in Nazi Germany. Siodmak had been living a normal life in Germany only to have it thrown into chaos and himself on the run when the Nazis took control, just as Larry Talbot finds his normal life thrown into chaos and himself on the run once he is turned into a werewolf. Also, the wolfman himself can be seen as a metaphor for the Nazis an otherwise good man who is transformed into a vicious killing animal who knows who his next victim will be when he sees the symbol of a pentagram (i.e., a star) on them.Even a man who is pure at heart, and says his prayers by night, may become a wolf when the wolfbane blooms and the autumn moon is bright. This quote has been listed in some sources as an authentic Gypsy or Eastern European folk saying. Writer Curt Siodmak admits that he simply made it up. Nonetheless, the rhyme would be recited in every future Universal film appearance of the Wolf Man, and would also be quoted in Van Helsing (2004). Lon Chaney Jr.'s make-up took six hours to apply, and three hours to get off. Jack Pierce, meticulously added yak hair, fangs, a rubber snout and other uncomfortable features to Chaney's face and body. The actor didn't exactly enjoy the process and once complained, What gets me is after work when I'm hot and itchy and tired, and after I've got to sit in that chair for forty-five minutes while Pierce just about kills me, ripping off the stuff he put on me in the morning. Lon Chaney, Jr., son of the famous silent actor who specialized in grotesque characters and masochistic melodramas, was not yet known as a horror film actor when he was offered the lead role in The Wolf Man. Previously he had enjoyed some critical success as the retarded Lennie in both the stage play and the 1939 film version of John Steinbeck's OF MICE AND MEN but it wasn't until he starred in MAN MADE MONSTER (1941) for director George Waggner that he began to gravitate toward horror roles. Maria Ouspenskaya, who played the old Gypsy woman, was only six years older than Bela Lugosi, who played her son.Evelyn Ankers had a rough time on the set. Lon Chaney Jr. delighted in sneaking up on her in full makeup and scaring her senseless. Even more troublesome than Chaney's behavior was the thick, chemical fog that permeated the set daily and made breathing difficult. For one scene, Ankers had to faint and fall to the misty ground but the fog fumes were so strong she passed out. Unnoticed by the director and crew who were concentrating on another aspect of the scene, she remained there unnoticed until a studio technician began breaking down the set. The wolf that Larry Talbot fights with was Lon Chaney Jr.'s own German Shepherd. Patric Knowles who plays the handsome friend of Gwen was last seen in THREE CAME HOME. A surprise hit for Universal, over the years the film's reputation has steadily improved with horror buffs and film scholars noticing the strains of Greek tragedy (the grim trajectory of Talbot's relationship with his domineering father) and old world superstitions that run throughout the movie. The Wolf Man is responsible for establishing the mythology and on-screen representation of werewolf lore that followed in subsequent imitators from the pentagrams to the wolfbane to the full moon transformation scenes. In the end, though, The Wolf Man is Lon Chaney, Jr.'s finest hour, and it's certainly Maria Ouspenskaya's most memorable role as well. -------------------------- Russian actress Maria Ouspenskaya's most memorable role Maleva, the gypsy fortune-teller who shares Talbot's pain, Ouspenskaya's soothing recitations still haunt many a young viewer who saw the film at an impressionable age (in thick accent) The way you walk was thorny through no fault of your own, but as the rain enters the soil the river enters the sea, so tears run to a predestined end.

","genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"15 June 2009","score":"6 out of 10 people found the following review useful","review":" Niagara (1953)Well she sure got herself an armful of groceries.If there as any noir film that holds it noir gloom even though shot largely in daylight, not in a city, and in vivid color, Niagara is it. There are a handful of color noir films, not including some from the 1970s and later that get swept into the category in an expansive but not always helpful way (Chinatown, for one). But this is the real deal, and it's not a perfect film by any means, but it's also a neglected movie, valuable for it's unique feel, for the terrific night scenes it does have, and for the Niagara Falls, which Hitchcock was probably jealous of. There are lots of Hitchcock parallels--famous landmark for a setting, stereotypes played both ways, calm before the disaster, undisguised back projection and its confession of open artifice, innocents caught in a murderous world--but it it's better to see what this movie has on its own terms.One thing Niagara has is Marilyn Monroe playing Rose Loomis. Monroe the actress is forced (or reinforced) into her recurring role as helpless siren, but she also shows off as the actress she always was, not brilliant, but very effective and smart. The disdain she has in a momentary sneer as she rolls over the second time in bed in her first scene is the first of a thousand good examples--listen to her in the shower backlit, or watch her at the souvenir shop, or on the phone. With a number of adjustments, her role here could have created a paradigm for the two-faced femme-fatale in the 1950s--her coy chill, her thinly disguised greed, her human failings. We never mind sympathizing with a criminal when she is going down at the end if she has earlier shown her complexity and vulnerability. Joseph Cotten is a problem. He's a terrific actor, but he's not the most beguiling of lead men, nor the sexiest. Wells probably had him figured out best in Citizen Kane and The Magnificent Ambersons, and Hitchcock used him beautifully in Shadow of a Doubt, all three movies from a decade earlier. Cukor didn't utilize Cotten's innate likability very well in Gaslight but he tried. Here, Hathaway doesn't really have charm as an option, because Cotten's role as George Loomis is endlessly miserable and self-pitying. Playing against his grain leaves us a little uncomfortable, and the film a little awkward.As usual with films of this type, there are small things that loom large. After getting soaked on purpose in the spray of the falls at the start of the film (and announcing his desire to find his independence), Cotten, as George Loomis, steps to one side to avoid the spray of a little sprinkler along the sidewalk. There is something here about a man who is making choices, who wants his life to be big but little things are getting in the way. The outdoor dancing scene is an idealized but really delicious view of youth culture as the big band era is about to shift to all out rock and roll (remember, it's 1952 when filmed). Monroe even gets to sing a little, and though the camera goes too static here (and elsewhere), the color and dramatic lighting compensate.If there is one thing that drags the film down it's the clumsy script by Charles Brackett, who has some great scripts to his credit. This one is not only badly written in spots, but also improbable in several key scenes. Singlehandedly, it keeps Niagara falling. Right behind is the hyperbolic acting of the other male lead, the cheery Casey Adams playing the painfully sexist Ray Cutler. It's tough to watch (though even more excessive is the barrel of laughs in Don Wilson playing a goofy executive), and so you wait it out and gather up the plot. Jean Peters playing the good, well adjusted Polly Cutler is at first a small cliché, but her role grows, and grows on you, so by the dramatic end you are stuck on her the way she says Cotten is stuck on Monroe, and she makes up for a lot slack elsewhere. The contrast of the two couples--the Monroe\/Cotten dysfunctional disaster waiting to happen and the too perfect cheery Adams\/Peters pair--is at the serious core to the movie. The high drama, taking place as both a murder gone wrong and as the falls itself, with its scenery and fabulous tourist machinery, hooks us all along, capping it with the final sweep down the river toward the falls (and over it).

There are a handful of color noir films, not including some from the 1970s and later that get swept into the category in an expansive but not always helpful way (Chinatown, for one). But this is the real deal, and it's not a perfect film by any means, but it's also a neglected movie, valuable for it's unique feel, for the terrific night scenes it does have, and for the Niagara Falls, which Hitchcock was probably jealous of. There are lots of Hitchcock parallels--famous landmark for a setting, stereotypes played both ways, calm before the disaster, undisguised back projection and its confession of open artifice, innocents caught in a murderous world--but it it's better to see what this movie has on its own terms.One thing Niagara has is Marilyn Monroe playing Rose Loomis. Monroe the actress is forced (or reinforced) into her recurring role as helpless siren, but she also shows off as the actress she always was, not brilliant, but very effective and smart. The disdain she has in a momentary sneer as she rolls over the second time in bed in her first scene is the first of a thousand good examples--listen to her in the shower backlit, or watch her at the souvenir shop, or on the phone. With a number of adjustments, her role here could have created a paradigm for the two-faced femme-fatale in the 1950s--her coy chill, her thinly disguised greed, her human failings. We never mind sympathizing with a criminal when she is going down at the end if she has earlier shown her complexity and vulnerability. Joseph Cotten is a problem. He's a terrific actor, but he's not the most beguiling of lead men, nor the sexiest. Wells probably had him figured out best in Citizen Kane and The Magnificent Ambersons, and Hitchcock used him beautifully in Shadow of a Doubt, all three movies from a decade earlier. Cukor didn't utilize Cotten's innate likability very well in Gaslight but he tried. Here, Hathaway doesn't really have charm as an option, because Cotten's role as George Loomis is endlessly miserable and self-pitying. Playing against his grain leaves us a little uncomfortable, and the film a little awkward.As usual with films of this type, there are small things that loom large. After getting soaked on purpose in the spray of the falls at the start of the film (and announcing his desire to find his independence), Cotten, as George Loomis, steps to one side to avoid the spray of a little sprinkler along the sidewalk. There is something here about a man who is making choices, who wants his life to be big but little things are getting in the way. The outdoor dancing scene is an idealized but really delicious view of youth culture as the big band era is about to shift to all out rock and roll (remember, it's 1952 when filmed). Monroe even gets to sing a little, and though the camera goes too static here (and elsewhere), the color and dramatic lighting compensate.If there is one thing that drags the film down it's the clumsy script by Charles Brackett, who has some great scripts to his credit. This one is not only badly written in spots, but also improbable in several key scenes. Singlehandedly, it keeps Niagara falling. Right behind is the hyperbolic acting of the other male lead, the cheery Casey Adams playing the painfully sexist Ray Cutler. It's tough to watch (though even more excessive is the barrel of laughs in Don Wilson playing a goofy executive), and so you wait it out and gather up the plot. Jean Peters playing the good, well adjusted Polly Cutler is at first a small cliché, but her role grows, and grows on you, so by the dramatic end you are stuck on her the way she says Cotten is stuck on Monroe, and she makes up for a lot slack elsewhere. The contrast of the two couples--the Monroe\/Cotten dysfunctional disaster waiting to happen and the too perfect cheery Adams\/Peters pair--is at the serious core to the movie. The high drama, taking place as both a murder gone wrong and as the falls itself, with its scenery and fabulous tourist machinery, hooks us all along, capping it with the final sweep down the river toward the falls (and over it).

But, like most films, the end of Moulin Rogue ends a bit more dramatically, and, in spite of the rough ending, emotionally better than my buddy's story, though, again ironically, reality turned out to be better than the film because no one died of tuberculosis (or anything else for that matter).The film shows the story of the naiveté of a young idealist writer who throws himself into the realm of the seamy Parisian underworld, and falls for a woman who only loves him for what he can do for her and her confederates. During the course of the story there are some emotional twists.It's a light and fancy melodrama with some dark undercurrents that keeps the tension fun and gripping. MacGregor and Kidman have real chemistry in this kitschy effort, which again melds with the overall thrust of the film to tell us a tale of Bohemian values and their short comings in a world fraught with survivalist concerns.Realities of life color and pull at the facade of the fairy tale the characters hope to live. The dark presence, the antagonist, plays no real part in the fate of the drama, but adds much needed tension to the story (however much despised he is by the rest of the characters). In the end we see his part as being trivial at best.And therein lies the larger message of the film. Would the story have had the end had everyone followed their hearts in the first place? Would the couple have met? Would they have ended on better terms, albethey without one another? To what purpose does lording wealth, over those who need it, serve? Money truly does not buy happiness.There's a definite theme of honesty undulating here. Betrayal served a purpose for those involved, but did it serve a higher purpose? Was it worth it? This is the question the film poses to the audience.Stylistically it's a bit hard to take. The film itself is like a giant MTV music video.

I missed it in the theatres, but bought the special collector's DVD when it hit the store shelves, and don't regret it one bit.If I had a nitpick, and I'm not sure that I do, it might be with some of the tunes chosen for the musical sequences. They're songs I was familiar with, and I think that lends the film a kind of youthful credibility, but or two original songs might've been welcome.Ewan MacGregor is dashing and Nicole Kidman is ravishing as always. They make a fine couple, and tug at our heart's sentiment.Definitely worth renting or owning.Enjoy.

I personally think for this masterpiece, the rating should be higher, honestly the quality of the acting and cinematography makes it worthy to be in the top 250. I honestly did think that this film is just extraordinary, beautifully shot with wonderful locations, and matched perfectly by one of the most gorgeous music scores I have ever heard in my life, composed by George Fenton that never interfered with the calmness of the film. Richard Attenborough has directed many ambitious but beautifully made films like Oh!What a Lovely War, Cry Freedom and Chaplin, and I will say that Shadowlands deserves to be up there with his best, it is a heart-rending film of true love and the consequences that left me speechless(I am 17), that I don't think has had enough praise. The performances were just outstanding. Anthony Hopkins was phenomenal as CS Lewis, and I am glad he got some awards for his performance, honestly it was that good. Debra Winger is just perfection as Joy Gresham, a victim of the devastating illness bone cancer. The two leads' chemistry is the main reason why I love this movie, I confess I cried when Lewis held the dying Joy in his arms, the reason being it reminded me of Mimi's Death Scene in La Boheme. The child star, Joseph Mazello was a huge surprise as Douglas, a boy of wide imagination and deep feeling. The scene where he and Lewis are crying in each other's arms made my eyes well up with emotion, never until yesterday did I see Hopkins look so tender with anybody on screen, not even in The Elephant Man. As Warnie, Edward Hardwicke best known for his appearances as Dr Watson in the 80s-90s Sherlock Holmes series was remarkable, a minor character but one with feeling and understanding. The actors are helped by a poignant and well-written script, that at times does give clever nods to Lewis's literary genius. It is no wonder that Shadowlands got an award for best British film of the year, it is just beautiful. It is more steady paced than the Elephant Man, another film I am really fond of,and less involving in terms of action, but neither of these things are disadvantages, because i cannot deny what joy I felt watching this film. 10\/10 Bethany Cox.

Ed Harly lives with his son. They are poor but happy, until one afternoon young Harly is accidentally killed by bunch of city kids having a reckless bike race. Utterly enraged, Ed Harley seeks out a witch who lives nearby, and he gets her to raise a demon to take revenge for him. But as the kids are killed off one by one by the demon, Harley feels the pain of burden increase, so he decides to help the few surviving kids destroy the demon.Given the low budget, I have to say that the art department did a decent job. There are haunted houses, misty pumpkin fields and old ageing structures which resemble the houses from The Cabinet of Dr. Calligari. The creature Pumpkinhead is certainly creepy looking, but he is far from scary. He moves slower than a snail and his attacks are rather torpid. Despite a fearsome set of teeth, the demon is better at killing people by throwing them around in hilarious ways rather than doing something more horror worthy like biting heads or limbs off.This creature will not go down as one of Stan Winston's best creations, and the movie will certainly not go down as one of the best indie horrors, but it might be worth a look at for horror geeks.

This is evidence that talent is also the consistency an actor can play a wide variety of roles.The actors also do a splendid job of playing conflicting emotions. For example, Karin acts like a part of her wants to be touched by her sister Maria, yet Karin barks, Don't touch me. This painful contraction is quite complex and she pulls it off realistically. These characters do this back and forth through out the film, and the performance holds together weather they are crying, being vulnerable, or being cold and abrasive.Furthermore, the ensemble works extremely well.

The film does look beautiful, with lovely sets and costumes, and the special effects work is some of the best of its kind of any family film of the 80s or of any decade, Tick-Tock and the Nome King are brilliantly designed. Return to Oz, with its very imaginative storytelling- seen in memorable scenes like with the heads- and enchantingly dark atmosphere, also has enough magic to engage the viewer, well to me it does anyway. The climax is chillingly effective, though Nome King did seem to be defeated too easily. Fairuza Balk is excellent as Dorothy, charming, sincere and even adorable. Many have complained that Balk is too young for the character, but in the 1939 musical Judy Garland was nearly 17 when in the book Dorothy is about 12. I also loved the music score and the cinematography, which was both dreamlike and nightmarish. Another mention should go to Nicol Williamson in the duel roles of Dr Worley and the Nome King(who may be a bit too scary for young viewers, likewise with the character of Mombi), he did a truly wonderful job in both roles, particularly the latter where he was threatening in an understated way. Also to Pumpkinhead, who a number of times, came close to stealing the show, and Tick-Tock, whose personality is perhaps the most colourful of all. The only character I didn't care for was the chicken, who is annoying at times and not really that necessary.

Luke Goss a relatively unknown is the stand out as Nomack the leader of the Reapers. Goss makes for an imposing a villain who's a real challenge to Blade.

In this sequel Blade forms an uneasy alliance with the vampire council in order to combat the Reapers a more deadlier breed of super-vampires who not only feed on humans but vampires as well. Kris Kristofferson also reprises his role as Blade's mentor Whistler and he's still effective in the part. Lucikly he's given a little more to do in this one. The rest of the cast are good in their roles including Ron Perlman, Lenora Verola, Thomas Kretschman, Norman Reedus, and Karel Roden in a brief appearance as a corrupt lawyer. Luke Goss a relatively unknown is the stand out as Nomack the leader of the Reapers. Goss makes for an imposing a villain who's a real challenge to Blade. Their final showdown at the end was a bit of a letdown mainly because it's over too quickly but Goss still makes for a great villain none the less under all the makeup used to create his character. The rest of the cast are okay in their limited screen time. The action\/fight sequences are impressive and there's more of them in this one fortunately. The pace was fast mainly because of the action and some of the new characters are developed enough others no so much. The final showdown between Blade and Nomack felt rushed as mentioned before but it was still fierce and intense. The ending was fitting and the rest of the movie made up for it's few flaws. Overall Blade 2 is better than the original with plenty of cool martial arts action, impressive special effects, some suspense, a little humor, and exceptional performances by the cast (Snipes and especially Goss) who make this vampire sequel worth the time to watch.
