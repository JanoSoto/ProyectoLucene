It's classic horror and if you are a horror fan, you aren't really a proper one if you haven't seen this one yet. To be fair, it took me a fair long while to get my hands on it, I was waiting for it to come on the telly, but I got fed up of waiting and decided to just buy it to coincide with my Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (which is completely different, but good in its own way.) The title may be eye-catching, but it has some incredible content to warrant that title.The Texas Chain saw Massacre is just full of so many classic moments, from the hitch hiker scene to Kirk's death, from the dinner scene to leatherface's insane chainsaw ballet, it's incredibly iconic. It's also one of the very few films that has managed to scare me. Some people might laugh at it in places, but to me (and many others it seems) it's just completely terrifying. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre has this unique raw feeling, which separates it from other films, because it doesn't feel like a film, it feels real and almost documentary-like. It's surreal insanity also makes for unsettling viewing because it feels like a nightmare. There's a choking atmosphere of dread throughout, which probably shines through because the cast actually went crazy in that unbearable baking heat.The lighting and cinematography are both impressive too. The final scene makes excellent use of the piercing morning sun, which gives this horrible edge to the images (a good kind of horrible) and the dinner scene is terrifyingly intense with the sharp sounds and close-ups of Marilyn's eyes. The chainsaw chase sequence is probably one of my favourite scenes in horror movie history. It completely renders that horrific feeling of being chased by someone with a chainsaw. The lack of music in that scene also adds to its stark realism. This film is way ahead of its time.Gunnar Hansen and the rest of the cannibal clan are also uncomfortable actors to watch. Gunnar's movements are brutal and scary, as he sort of stomps around and moves in a very animalistic way unlike Michael Myers or Freddy Kruger who are both slight fellows. Leatherface is very scary villain. Grandad is also pretty disturbing with the unnatural make-up and abnormal behaviour. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is also responsible for one of the most annoying characters in film history. Franklin. The wheelchair man. His high-pitched texan voice and irritating behaviour are both funny and annoying! But I think that he contributes to the film in a good way.Sound is used effectively as well, with the ambient noises of the abattoir playing in the background, and the piercing stings to highlight the imagery being used. Everything from the sound of the chainsaw to Marilyn's excellent vocal screaming all works perfectly to construct some realistic and scary footage! The ending is also beautifully done, and leaves you thinking, what the hell have I just witnessed? Some might say The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is slow to build-up but I disagree. There's an atmospheric scene with the hitchhiker and a brilliant build-up to the obscure events that follow. It's a nightmarish and terrifying film that will always stay with you. It also seems to get better with every viewing, and acts as more of an experience than your average horror film. It's genuinely scary and quite simply a classic. If you haven't seen it yet, just go onto Amazon and click Buy. It's worth your time.

But by 1998 there hadn't been a major decent one of those for years, and it was time for another makeover. Saving Private Ryan harks back to the genre's peak in the late 40s and early 50s, when war movies were exciting pictures about heroism and unquestionable moral reasoning. However, the intervening time in cinematic and social development can't be ignored, and so this time around combat must be realistically hellish, and there has to be some kind of philosophical questioning going on.This is all very well, but Saving Private Ryan is also very much part of the modern era's blockbuster strand, and it seems a conflict between brutal realism and cornball simplicity. In between the battle scenes there is some woefully clichéd dialogue and dramatically flat moments. Characters like Upham are just lazily-written stereotypes, and the point-making about the perils of showing mercy to the Germans is heavy-handed. Then there's the John Williams score, which is just like so many other overblown and slightly smug-sounding John Williams scores. You wouldn't think a musical score could be condescending, but this one is.Director Steven Spielberg won his second Oscar for Saving Private Ryan. As with Schindler's List, the frequency and arbitrariness of the killing soon makes us desensitised to it, and immerses us in a world where randomised death is a constant threat. And Spielberg clearly knows how to balance this. For example, about halfway through the battle we see Hanks and his men gradually making some headway. The troops aren't dropping like flies anymore, but the sheer brutality of the previous ten minutes means we never forget the danger the men are in. But the trouble is Spielberg occasionally resorts to techniques like slow-motion and sound distortion, putting the experience upon us in a way that feels obviously artificial, as oppose to letting the images draw us in. And he makes a basic error, I feel, in showing a few point-of-view shots from the German gun positions. Surely the whole point of this scene (and the movie in general) is keeping us with the US troops and never being objective, and yet Spielberg violates his own premise.And yet this is overall a well-made piece and there remains much to like. Despite the weaknesses in the screenplay's minutiae, its odyssey structure gives it a powerful sweep and makes up for the deficits in characterisation. The picture gains resonance is it goes along, and to my mind the later battle sequence at Ramille with its eerie sound effects and man-versus-tank dynamics, is superior to the opening one. Saving Private Ryan is not without its flaws, but it is enough to reinvigorate a genre that was starting to flag.

Basically most of the action takes place and outside of the Quick Stop convenience store in New Jersey, with clerk Dante Hicks (Brian O'Halloran) called in to work on his day off, Saturday, and his fellow clerk friend Randal Graves (Jeff Anderson) working in the video store next door always bothering his customers. Dante is not just undedicated to his job, but he is having numerous problems crop up on this day, such as his current girlfriend Veronica Loughran (Marilyn Ghigliotti) bugging him with college plans, and admitting to giving thirty seven guys blowjobs in the past, but doesn't count it as getting with them. There is also his ex-girlfriend Caitlin Bree (Lisa Spoonhauer), who he may still love, getting married, the store shutters stuck, a scheduled game of hockey at 2 o'clock, it is the last day he has to attend the wake of a dead ex-girlfriend, and having to deal with unintelligent customers. But more than anything what is the biggest problem for Dante is that that he is not meant to be there at all, hence the phone calls asking for a replacement, and having to take the blame for unintentionally selling a child cigarettes, which he did without noticing. With the encouragement of Randal, he does bend the rules a little in order to do what he needs to and have a bit of a better day, of course he still has his complaints and negative attitude to many things. Throughout the day, outside the convenience store, we also see stoners Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith, also writing, producing and editing) doing their usual marijuana dealing, and Jay doing most of the talking about his womanising and other dirty talk, Silent Bob only speaks rarely with wisdom and one liners (that's in the other Smith films too). The film ends with Dante forced to work the entire day shift at Quick Stop, with Vernoica angrily breaking up with him having found out about his feelings towards ex Caitlan, but he says he will try to talk her back later, and Randal leaves with him to flip the closed sign. Also starring Ernest O'Donnell as Rick Derris and Kimberly Loughran as Heather Jones. Besides Jay and Silent Bob, who obviously became more and more popular in continuous Smith films, O'Halloran and Anderson make a fantastically funny duo as they ramble and discuss various meaningless or opinionated topics, such as sex, food prices, more sex, videos, even more sex, Star Wars, and lots more sex. The film is built up on a brilliantly witty, dry, and sometimes wincing script, the blowjob discussion and Star Wars chat are definitely the highlights, the black and white somehow adds to the affective feel, but there are the sensitive moments as well, so all in all it adds up to a wonderful comedy masterpiece.

Basically most of the action takes place and outside of the Quick Stop convenience store in New Jersey, with clerk Dante Hicks (Brian O'Halloran) called in to work on his day off, Saturday, and his fellow clerk friend Randal Graves (Jeff Anderson) working in the video store next door always bothering his customers. Dante is not just undedicated to his job, but he is having numerous problems crop up on this day, such as his current girlfriend Veronica Loughran (Marilyn Ghigliotti) bugging him with college plans, and admitting to giving thirty seven guys blowjobs in the past, but doesn't count it as getting with them. There is also his ex-girlfriend Caitlin Bree (Lisa Spoonhauer), who he may still love, getting married, the store shutters stuck, a scheduled game of hockey at 2 o'clock, it is the last day he has to attend the wake of a dead ex-girlfriend, and having to deal with unintelligent customers. But more than anything what is the biggest problem for Dante is that that he is not meant to be there at all, hence the phone calls asking for a replacement, and having to take the blame for unintentionally selling a child cigarettes, which he did without noticing. With the encouragement of Randal, he does bend the rules a little in order to do what he needs to and have a bit of a better day, of course he still has his complaints and negative attitude to many things. Throughout the day, outside the convenience store, we also see stoners Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith, also writing, producing and editing) doing their usual marijuana dealing, and Jay doing most of the talking about his womanising and other dirty talk, Silent Bob only speaks rarely with wisdom and one liners (that's in the other Smith films too). The film ends with Dante forced to work the entire day shift at Quick Stop, with Vernoica angrily breaking up with him having found out about his feelings towards ex Caitlan, but he says he will try to talk her back later, and Randal leaves with him to flip the closed sign. Also starring Ernest O'Donnell as Rick Derris and Kimberly Loughran as Heather Jones. Besides Jay and Silent Bob, who obviously became more and more popular in continuous Smith films, O'Halloran and Anderson make a fantastically funny duo as they ramble and discuss various meaningless or opinionated topics, such as sex, food prices, more sex, videos, even more sex, Star Wars, and lots more sex.

It's the dark and tragic story of a Sicilian mafia family, the Corleones. It's an amazing film that I consider to be superior to the first and one of the best films of all time. It starts with a 9 year old Vito Corleone, A.K.A. 'The Godfather, the future head of the Corleone crime family. He is in Sicily at his father's funeral, who had been murdered by the local mafia. At the funeral Vito's older brother is also killed, and the mafia chief is determined to murder Vito too. His mother begs for his freedom, but the mafia chief knows that if he lets him go, Vito will one day come back for revenge. Vito's mother bravely picks up a knife and holds it to the chief's throat, allowing him to escape, but she is quickly gunned down. Vito then immigrates to New York and arrives at Ellis Island. The movie then flashes forward through time and the darker story of his son, Michael Corleone, begins.The movie then starts to alternate between the stories of Vito Corleone as he rises in the New York Mafia in the 1920's, and Michael Corleone as he struggles to maintain his father's empire in the late 50's. So it acts as both a prequel and a sequel. I thought that this was the most interesting part of the film, because you see how Vito started with nothing and built an empire, while Michael starts with this empire and has to keep it all from crumbling. Another thing that you see throughout the film is the extreme transformation of the character of Michael. In just a few years, he had become more brutal and ruthless than Vito ever was. You see just how corrupted Michael had become when he does something at the end that is horrifying and unforgivable. That's the point when his job and corruption from power had driven him to do something that destroys his family and himself.Another strong part of the film is its performances. The movie dominated the Academy Awards nominations for Best Supporting Actor\/Actress, with Robert De Niro (Vito Corleone), Michael V. Gazzo (Frank Pentangeli), Talia Shire (Connie Corleone), and Lee Strasberg (Hyman Roth) all nominated for that category, and Al Pacino (Michael Corleone) nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Robert De Niro was the one awarded the Oscar, one of the many awards that the film has been given. Robert De Niro was also awarded an Oscar for his performance as the character). Al Pacino also did a great job of portraying the change of his character from the first film and throughout this one. He went from a young WWII veteran trying to break away from his family's business to being the country's most powerful mob bosses.All of these things are what make the movie a masterpiece. It won many awards, including Best Picture at the 1974 Academy Awards. The characters are great, which is helped by the award-winning performances of the actors. The two alternating stories are what made the movie so much more interesting than the first. It's currently number 32 on the American Film Institute's 100 Years&#x85;100 Movies list, and number 3 on IMDb's top 250 movies list.

In the process, he makes several mistakes that any kid his age would make.

Some people have recognized the film's merits and it gained a cult following manly at the Super Mario Bros.

Basically Marshal Will Kane (Oscar and Golden Globe winning Gary Cooper) has just got married to Amy Fowler (Grace Kelly), and he planned to go into retirement, hanging up his badge to have a regular life away from Hadleyville. But when he was about to leave with his new wife he gets the news from men coming into town who tell him that a man he arrested and sent to prison years ago, Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald), is making his way on the noon train, and he wants revenge. This puts fear into the townspeople, and they tell the Marshall that he should leave while he can, and Will does originally plan to do this, but he knows he is the only one can face Miller. To go against the villain and his gang however he needs the help of anyone who can handle a gun like he can, but everyone he asks refuses because of they are too scared of being killed in combat, they and Amy just want him to leave town. Will also warns Miller's first lover, and his own former lover, Helen Ramírez (Golden Globe winning and nominated Katy Jurado) that he is on his way, and knowing what threat he will bring if he finds her, she sells her business and makes preparations to leave. As Will asks around Hadleyville he gets increasingly agitated but equally determined as the criminal makes his way, with the minutes passing by very quickly, and the time of noon getting ever closer. Finally it comes to the time that Miller is to arrive in the town, he and his gang make their way through the quiet town, with everyone hiding, and the shooting begins as they and Kane in the hay barn do gun battle, of course the hero prevails in the end, he throws his badge down, and Will and Amy ride away out of town. Also starring Airplane's Lloyd Bridges as Deputy Marshal Harvey Pell, Otto Kruger as Judge Percy Mettrick, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly's Lee Van Cleef as Jack Colby, Thomas Mitchell as Mayor Jonas Henderson, Lon Chaney Jr. as Martin Howe and Harry Morgan as Sam Fuller. Cooper gives a terrific commanding performance as the law man awaiting the showdown with the bad guys, Kelly is also well cast as his innocent wife, and Jurado is also great in her role as the woman that knew both men that will do battle. I can see what the critics mean by this film having a psychological element to it, and it is certainly a clever aspect playing out the action in real time, i.e. in the one day with the hours passing until the noon deadline, a most watchable classic western. It won the Oscars for Best Film Editing, Best Song for Tex Ritter's High Noon (Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darlin') (number 25 on 100 Years, 100 Songs) and Best Music for Dimitri Tiomkin, and it was nominated for Best Picture for Stanley Kramer and Best Writing, Screenplay for Carl Foreman, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Cinematography and Best Motion Picture Score, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay.

This eye-opening rockumentary, as the film's director Marti DeBergi, calls it, chronicles British rock band, Spinal Tap, self-proclaimed as the world's loudest band, as they embark on an American tour, and come to find out that hard truth. Being the biggest band in the world during the 1960's, this documentary follows the band during their 1984 tour, and DeBergi captures the raw truth of what it is like to be a rock band in decline.Of course, that is just the storyline of the film. This is Spinal Tap pioneered the mockumentary  movement in American film, and actually had quite a few people fooled into thinking that this was a real band. The band members, David St. Hubbins, Nigel Tufnel, and Derek Smalls (played by Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, and Harry Shearer, respectively), come to find out that their fame isn't what it used to be, as they plod along the tour dealing with small half-filled venues, canceled shows, being second billed to a puppet show, and even playing to an army base on leave that was more reminiscent of a bad company Christmas party. Lampooning is in full effect here as the film is a parody of gigantic, over-the-top rock bands and their pretentious lyrics, overblown stage props, and overall inability to see the truth about themselves and their level of cultural importance.Just about every scene is memorable and quotable (i.e. the famous it goes to 11 bit, Derek Smalls getting trapped in a stage prop, the Stonehenge concert scene, getting lost backstage, etc.). The clever writing is actually credited to the stars of the film and all act their part wonderfully. It was due to their acting ability, coupled with Reiner's ability to make a fake documentary, that people actually believed that the band was real. June Chadwick also turned in a great performance as Jeanine Pettibone, the proverbial Yoko Ono of the band. This film was also filled with cameos from Bruno Kirby, to Billy Crystal, to Fred Willard, all of whom contributed their own unique style to this film. The direction by Rob Reiner was also great in this movie. Even though I knew that this was a fake band, I couldn't help feeling sorry for them at times as their reality caves-in on them and the band is faced to force the reality of their situation.This is Spinal Tap did pioneer the mockumentary, as several others followed in its footsteps, however, I don't think that any will have the impact that Spinal Tap did. The success and fanfare following this film is so large, that the fake band has even released music albums, gone on tours, and the actors have reprised their roles several times in the last 27 years, including a guest spot on the Simpsons, of which Shearer is a regular cast member. This is Spinal Tap is a wonderfully made film that most should take the time to see. I say most, because, I believe that as a pre-requisite to watching this film, you have to be somewhat familiar with rock music and rock stars.

Twenty years pass Tomania has been taken over by dictator Adenoid Hynkel and his stooges Garbitsch and Herring. Hynkel despises all Jews and regularly wreaks havoc on the Tomanian Jewish ghetto, where feisty Hannah lives. Meanwhile, the little barber escapes from the hospital and instinctively heads back to his cobweb-laden ghetto barber shop. Unaware of Hynkel's policy towards Jews (in fact, he's unaware of Hynkel), the barber gets into a slapstick confrontation with a gang of Aryan storm troopers.

He is not an actor, however, and maybe this is why the film hits its mark so well and comes across so realistically. Maggiorani is of this difficult world and his brooding face is a clear indication of this. His job is to plaster film posters up on the walls of buildings all over Rome. He even hangs a picture that symbolizes the absolute opposite of the misery surrounding him. Rita Hayworth from GILDA is on the walls all over the city, a sign of joy to some, a representation of their own lowly status to others.When the bicycle is actually stolen, the title character is sought after by Maggiorani and his young son (Enzo Staiola), a little kid with so much acting ability, you swear this must be a documentary.

It won Original Screenplay. It was nominated for six other Oscars including Best Picture and Best Director. I see it is given four out of four stars if it is on TV. It is also in IMDb's Top 250. (But) what is the big deal about it? I was bored and disappointed. Pulp Fiction did not really make a whole lot of sense. I can not remember if it was nominated for editing or not. If they wanted to be in that category or have a better chance at winning then obviously more editing should have happened. I do not see the point of Vince and Mia's date. All if not a lot of that should have been cut. Why drag on Bruce Willis being on the run from the mafia don? That took too long. Was the whole story about the watch necessary? Couldn't Bruce and his woman just talk about it? Aside from being disappointing and boring Pulp Fiction was confusing. Bruce shoots John Travolta. And kills him. So how is he alive in The Bonnie Situation? Does Quentin Tarrantino not like editing too much? Well more editing could be needed a lot of times.(PF hint hint.) So yeah Pulp Fiction was boring, disappointing, confusing, etc. It should not have won Original Screenplay. It should have gone to someone else but if all five nominees were bad then it should have been none of them. Too much hype. Too much movie. Overrated. I can not remember much of this movie and happily so. So what is such the big deal?

Is it a scifi, romantic or a beautiful drama? Whatever be the genre, Phenomenon was touching & soulful.The lights that John Travolta's character experiences one night is open to interpretation and I prefer it that way. The mystery makes the movie all the more engaging & impressive to me.John Travolta(as George Malley) has given a heartfelt performance, many say, the best of his career. He was at ease in his role, being vulnerable, funny, intelligent, frustrated or even in love. The other actors who touch our hearts too are Robert Duvall(as Dr. Brunder), Forest Whitaker(as George's pal) and even the pretty Kyra Sedgwick(as John's crush, Lace) impresses.What I especially like about the movie is how the story still focuses more on the relationship between the character George and the others in the community after his life-changing experience one night that suddenly turns him into a gifted intellect. Otherwise, Phenomenon could have been just like any other superhero flick about Travolta saving the world with his bare hands or brain! The ending(final scene between George & Lace), I wish, could have been more effective. It came to an end a bit abruptly to me.Verdict Adorable & romantic. What starts off like a scifi ends being a tale of genuine friendship, care and love.

The supporting cast includes Joe E. Brown, Pat O'Brien and Nehemiah Persoff. The film is a remake by Wilder and I. A. L. Diamond of a 1935 French movie, Fanfare d'Amour, from the story by Robert Thoeren and Michael Logan, which was itself remade in 1951 by German director Kurt Hoffmann as Fanfaren der Liebe. However, both the French and German films were without the gangsters that are an integral part of the plot of Some Like It Hot. Wilder's working title for his film was Fanfares of Love, then Not Tonight, Josephine before he decided on Some Like It Hot as its release title.The launching pad for Billy Wilder's comedy classic was a rusty old German farce, Fanfares of Love, whose two main characters were male musicians so desperate to get a job that they disguise themselves as women and play with an all-girl band in gangster-dominated 1929 Chicago. In this version, musicians Joe and Jerry lose their jobs when a speakeasy owned by mob boss Spats Columbo is raided by prohibition agent Mulligan. Several weeks later, on February 14th, Joe and Jerry get a job performing in Urbana and end up witnessing a gangland massacre in a parking garage. Fearing that they will be next on the mobsters' hit lists, Joe devises an ingenious plan for disguising their identities. Soon they are all dolled up and performing as Josephine and Daphne in Sweet Sue's all-girl orchestra. En route to Florida by train with Sweet Sue's band, the boys (or girls?) make the acquaintance of Sue's lead singer Sugar Kane. Joe and Jerry immediately fall in love, though of course their new feminine identities prevent them from acting on their desires. Still, they are determined to woo her, and they enact an elaborate series of gender-bending ruses complicated by the fact that flirtatious millionaire Osgood Fielding has fallen in love with Daphne. The plot gets even thicker when Spats Columbo and his boys show up in Florida. Nominated for several Oscars, Some Like It Hot ended up the biggest moneymaking comedy up to 1959. Full of hilarious set pieces and movie in-jokes, it has not tarnished with time and in fact seems to get better with each passing year, as its cross-dressing humor keeps it only more and more up-to-date.This was also Marilyn Monroe's best performance in her legendary acting career.Overall,this comedy is one of the enduring treasures of the movies, a film of inspiration and meticulous craft for movies like this, with a sense of humor that is as broad as it can be sophisticated, come along only infrequently.
