Popular American films are often noisy, cheap feeling, shallow, and drowning in special effects, yet it is the foreign movies that get trounced and laughed at.Much like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, another underrated gem, Brotherhood of the Wolf is restrained but stylish and populated with imaginative characters. Unlike most movies, I went into this one not knowing what to expect. Oh sure, I've heard the praise on tv and seen one good review, but it wasn't enough to tell me just exactly how good it was. And having not seen the bad reviews, I wasn't spoiled or set up to be disappointed. It turns out to be the right choice because I have no idea where all these bad reviews came from.The beast in this movie is cleverly realized as the astute viewer will notice that it is not a werewolf or a product of monster movie conventions. While over the top, the beast in this movie could just as easily pass itself as another natural animal, despite its terrifying and vicious nature. And bravo to the movie's creators for throwing out horror movie cliches. If you think men and women in horror movies are divided into the running, screaming, panicky people and the super cool macho men and women, then watch this movie because it has none of it. The beast in this movie is far more stylish and clever than that. It delivers its terror and the right moment and in the right doses. It remains hidden in shadow, hardly ever seen, by audience and by character. By the time it kills, it's already too late, but before it does that, both the character and the audience are on the edge, gripped by terror and wondering where the hell this blasted creature is.Then there's the other side of the movie's story. Brotherhood of the Wolf isn't a monster movie but a detective story\/period piece\/romance novel with a little martial arts thrown in. In this movie, the people are nervous and angry at each other, but it isn't because of the beast. Something else is going with this movie, but it remains hidden until the very end. The movie then ties the beast with this hidden machination of the movie in a very clever way. Everything comes together nicely to climax in a stunning ending that will blow your mind. In the meantime, we get lots of action, terror, style, and sex.Don't believe what you hear about this movie being ugly, brutal, long, boring, and incomprehensible. The movie crafts its story cleverly and masterfully and ties its slowly unfolding elements into each other. Oh sure, a lot of people will hate it. But if you have the right mindset for it, it's a brilliant and thrilling ride and the most fun I've had in a long time.

Fans of the game will be treated to an extravagant audio visual feast with plenty of action, thrilling explosions and weird creatures. The music and sound is excellent. The only bad point in this film is the story. A lot of hard work has gone into producing a sense of realism that we take for granted in regular films. What's unique about this film is that it has been generated entirely in CG. It tries to present us with very realistic looking synthesized human characters. The most daunting task is in attaining visual realism in matching human behavior and expressions, as opposed to animating dinosaurs or cartoon characters.   The details and texture on the terrain, structures, machines and craft are by far the best I have seen. The designers have given great attention in portraying atmospheric effects and optical distortions. There is a scene where heat dissipates from the craft right before it touches down in the Tucson Wasteland (003519) This was perhaps the high point of visual realism in this film. Only a highly dedicated and serious production team can depict details to this extent.The bumpy flight in the craft was conveyed effectively by jerking the crew just like it happens in a train ride. A great deal of attention has been given to the natural aspects of vision that we take for granted in cinema. Lighting effects, focus, depth of field, lens-flares, motion blur and camera shakes add a sense of realism to this purely synthesized cinema. The details and dynamics of hair on Dr. Aki Ross have been rendered beautifully well.

There was little attention given to the cheek muscles in almost all characters. Smiles, frowns and laughter are limited to just the eyes mouth and forehead. The muscles around the eye sockets and the cheek bone area do not move at all. This is one major drawback that distracts you from the illusion being created.I am assuming that most of the action, if not all, was captured with real actors wearing motion capture gear, which explains the fluidity of movement in the characters. The dialogues match very well with their body language, especially by veteran actor Donald Sutherland. I couldn't help noticing some inexplicable resemblance between the character and the voice actor.The rather thin and unimpressive script is what actually brings this film down. One would be forced to ask this question Would this be a good film if all the characters were played by human? I doubt that very much. This film draws attention only because it's an attempt at mimicking humans. I could not digest the whole idea of spirits and some kind of spiritual reunion theory.

The lack of a strong script is perhaps the only shortcoming in this otherwise well executed film.All those aspiring 3D designers and animators must see this film at least twice and study it for its perfect execution of dynamics and atmospheric effects.

You see, people who write vague reviews are only supplementing their true opinion with what they are egged on to believe by other people. The Godfather is a prime example of that, as every positive IMDb user review with the exception of two or three comprehends what they really thought of the film.

I saw Citizen Kane on the impetus of its tagline as a landmark film and that Orson Welles' directed it. I did not know it was on the IMDb Top 10 or how many awards it won. Citizen Kane is an early examination of the American goal of industry. Charles Foster Kane starts out as a not so successful child, nurtured by connections and networking into one the richest publishers ever to walk the face of the earth. Loosely based on the career of William Randolph Hearst, who faced a similar not so glamourous remainder of his life, but unlike Kane he was a Nazi and an anti-Communist. As an actor Orson Welles is a chameleon and extremely unforgettable in the role of one man who had everything but one thing money can't buy. I advise you to watch Citizen Kane if you have not seen it already and to keep in mind that it was made in a totally different time period in America.

Ronin is a pure action movie, made by a veteran director. It has a great international cast, featuring Robert De Niro, Jean Reno, Jonathan Pryce, and others. The plot is fairly straightforward - but it's far from simplistic. A group of mercenaries gets hired to steal a certain suitcase - but of course things are never that simple. Soon, the plot thickens, etc.One of the things that set this movie apart is its setting. The movie was filmed on location in France - in and around Paris, as well as in more rural settings - which lends the movie an original atmosphere.As others have mentioned, the action scenes are handled brilliantly. The car chases may be the best since Bullitt - and in my humble opinion, they surpass it.This movie is highly recommended. If you like action movies, you just *have* to see Ronin.

It is a film that will make you question your own sanity in many ways. Naomi Watts is the young, starry-eyed Canadian that wants to make it big in Hollywood. She is naive and thinks that dreams can come true if you want them bad enough. Watts discovers a very beautiful woman with amnesia (Laura Harring in a sizzling performance) in her aunt's house in L.A. and she becomes determined to help Harring out. Harring is mysterious and her near-fatal car crash occurred on the dark and winding Mulholland Dr. Throughout several oddball and very dark scenes take place. A young director (Justin Theroux) learns that Hollywood is run by strange underworld figures that are quiet, but ruthless. Another strange side-story is the mysterious man behind the diner that is seen in another character's dreams. An inept assassin also runs around causing unwanted trouble for himself and others. Then of course there are cameos by Robert Forster and Billy Ray Cyrus. The film twists into darkness as it progresses as Watts' and Harring's relationship turns sexual. A fine line between reality and fantasy is skewered and it comes down to a strange Pandora's box that holds the true secrets to Mulholland Dr.. Oscar-nominated director David Lynch also shows that not all you see and hear is real, even though one's mind might think so. The film seems artificial at times, showing Hollywood as a nice place where dreams can come true. But then the dreams are turned into vivid nightmares of what could possibly be the true reality. David Lynch somehow makes this whole thing work and he makes it work beautifully in this reviewer's opinion. The film is a trumped-up version of The Twilight Zone and it adds many techniques that made Alfred Hitchcock the true master of suspense. Many wonder what this film is truly about. I am not sure. I am not sure Lynch even knows, but I am going to give it a shot. Mulholland Dr. is the dark side of the human condition. It is a film that shows how easy one can lose one's soul if bad elements are let in. There are figures that seem somewhat supernatural to me in this movie. It seems that many of the characters are messengers that are all after one thing Naomi Watts' soul. Watts lets the elements in and in the end she cannot overcome them. What she thinks she wants seems attractive on the outside, but there are cobras on the inside that will be too strong to fight off. In short, Mulholland Dr. is a brilliant piece of film-making and it is brilliant due to its unique aspects and the fact that it is what one thinks it is. There is no right or wrong answer and it is a film that makes you think. Mulholland Dr. is a complicated puzzle for the minds of cinema fanatics. 5 stars out of 5.

I was anxious to see this one, having heard it praised as a true masterpiece, and I must admit I was quite disappointed.*** SPOILERS AHEAD ****A lot of people who praise this movie say that it raises the question of whether Alex is truly reformed after his treatment or not. Frankly, I don't see how that's a question at all... to me, he was obviously not the least bit reformed, and only restraining himself because of the punishment he would receive if he acted out.Another point often brought up is the disturbing, shocking, nature of the film, and the effect is has on the viewer, but frankly, by today's (2002) standards, the violence is hardly anything special, and the sex only a bit less so. Silly, pointless movies like The Cell have disturbed me a lot more than this one.Many particular elements of the movie didn't sit well with me. The sickness that violence or sex induces in Alex during the second half of the film is really quite silly, it mostly consists of him holding his head and burping repeatedly. Even Alex himself describes it as, to paraphrase, the feeling that something horrible is going to happen to me. So... this punishment makes you paranoid? That's it? I imagine the scene where he's locked into a room and forced to listen to Beethoven (which induces the same sickness) was supposed to make you feel badly for him, but the ridiculous nature of this sickness made it more comical than anything to me. I kept wondering why he doesn't just stuff something in his ears, or break the door down (it looks like a very flimsy door). I realize that you can similarly question any movie, but I wouldn't have noticed these things if I hadn't been, by that point, pretty bored.Some elements of the movie particularly baffled me. There are many things that flat out SCREAM Look, I'm symbolic for something!, but for the life of me I can't figure out what. Why does Alex's mother (and later the psychiatrist) have purple hair? Why does the same elderly mother wear outfits of red leather and thigh high boots? Why does the gang that Alex's group fight in the beginning wear Army uniforms? Why is there such a strong homosexual innuendo (Alex's teacher grabbing his crotch early on, the chaplain making a pass at him, the old man at the end living alone with a young man, etc) throughout the film?One thing that confused me in particular, and this is an element most viewers will miss, is that the movie often uses Russian words. I notice only because I know Russian, as the words are easy to figure out through context. Alex and his friends go to a Moloko (Russian for 'milk') bar. Alex repeatedly uses Malchik (Russian for 'boy') to describe young men. Same with Devochka (Russian for 'girl') to describe the women. Near the end, Alex talks about eating Lomtiks (Russian for 'slice' or 'piece', usually in reference to food) of bread. As this movie is made during the height of the Cold War, is this some sort of attempt to associate Alex's mindless sex and violence with Russian culture?I can see no real message to this movie, besides that the treatment that Alex was given obviously doesn't work. But I fail to see any sort of point to that message, as this treatment obviously doesn't exist. If the message is against psychiatric rehabilitation in general, as opposed to incarceration, I don't think it makes the point very well, considering that the few years Alex spends in prison don't even seem all that bad, and certainly don't change him. He says that he endures horrible beatings from the guards, all we ever see him do in prison is sit around, fantasize about sex\/violence and quote the bible to please the chaplain. If the film was supposed to comment on how ineffective rehabilitation in general is, I don't see why there's an attempt in the second half of the movie to make Alex a sort-of sympathetic character. Shouldn't it show him as the monster he still is?I talked about this movie with a friend earlier, and he pointed out to me that at the time this film was released, the violence and sex was probably most shocking, and that there was a heavy movement towards psychiatric rehabilitation of prisoners at the time. If that's true, then this is simply a reactionary period piece, dealing with one very particular issue.Don't get me wrong, this is by no means a very bad movie.

This is by no means a classic, as it fails on the one crucial test it does NOT, at least for me, stand the test of time. I give this movie a 7\/10 for the first half of the film (up to the part where Alex goes to prison), which is surreal and often darkly hilarious, and 3\/10 for the rest of it, which I found boring, lacking in coherence, and, frankly, often quite silly and overdone.

You can take a perfectly good movie and in the interest of bringing in more dough, end up with something that isn't near as good (witness the glory of Highlander and the sequel we won't discuss), or, you can write a story well enough that you have something which improves on the first (see the fun Rush Hour and the improved Rush Hour 2).  Thankfully the folks from Marvel Comics movie line were able to fall into the latter category with Blade II. \tThose of us who saw the first one (or read the comics which he appeared in) know that Blade (played by Wesley Snipes) was infected by the vampire virus while in utero and was born with all the strengths of the vampire (nearly invulnerable, enhanced strength, increased speed and agility) and none of their weaknesses (crosses, sunlight, silver).  He does have the blood lust of the vampire but through serums is able to keep it under control.  As we saw in the first movie, with the assistance of his ally Whistler, Kris Kristofferson, Blade is the scourge of the vampire nations. \tSince the end of the first movie approximately three years have passed.  It appeared at the time of that movie that Whistler had died but apparently he had been whisked away by the vampires and was constantly being moved as Blade and his new weapons ally, Scud, tracked them across the world.  Blade finally frees Whistler and the three find their hideout under attack by some vampire warriors.  However the warriors are only bringing a message to Blade from the leader of the vampires.  They are proposing a truce as something far worse than Blade has begun hunting them.  A new breed of vampires known as Reapers have mutated and begun attacking vampires.  Unfortunately a bite from a Reaper tends to turn the attacked vampire into a new Reaper with the urge to kill more vampires.  Typically this wouldn't bother Blade but once the vampires are gone, humanity would be the next prey. \tBlade agrees to lead a group of warrior known as The Bloodpack against the Reapers.  The irony here occurs in that the Bloodpack has spent the better part of two years training to fight their new leader.  The pack on a whole is anonymous with two standing out, Reinhardt played by Ron Perlman is their deposed leader and Nyssa played by Leonor Varela carries a secret which will unfold throughout the movie. \tThe first meeting of Blade's group doesn't go near as well as they hoped since they discover most of the typical weapons against vampires are now useless.  Through some research they discover the main weapon, sunlight, still works and set about making new weapons. \tThe final battle against the Reapers carries some consequences unforeseen and then treachery strikes Blade with the actual villain being revealed. \tThis movie is heavily action oriented, is about a vampire hunter, and is quite gory.  If those things turn you off, don't go see this movie.  If, on the other hand, you don't mind those, you will most likely find this an entertaining movie.  Spanish Director Guillermo del Toro brings a dark, macabre look to this film.  His Reapers are as different from vampires as vampires from humanity.  Their look is stylized and fresh.  Their method of attack must be seen to be believed.  His pacing of the movie is right on pace with possibly more action than the original yet still maintaining some semblance's of an adequate plot. \tThe actors tend to be what makes this movie.  Many people see Wesley in only action roles and don't realize that he can act.

You can take a perfectly good movie and in the interest of bringing in more dough, end up with something that isn't near as good (witness the glory of Highlander and the sequel we won't discuss), or, you can write a story well enough that you have something which improves on the first (see the fun Rush Hour and the improved Rush Hour 2).  Thankfully the folks from Marvel Comics movie line were able to fall into the latter category with Blade II. \tThose of us who saw the first one (or read the comics which he appeared in) know that Blade (played by Wesley Snipes) was infected by the vampire virus while in utero and was born with all the strengths of the vampire (nearly invulnerable, enhanced strength, increased speed and agility) and none of their weaknesses (crosses, sunlight, silver).  He does have the blood lust of the vampire but through serums is able to keep it under control.  As we saw in the first movie, with the assistance of his ally Whistler, Kris Kristofferson, Blade is the scourge of the vampire nations. \tSince the end of the first movie approximately three years have passed.  It appeared at the time of that movie that Whistler had died but apparently he had been whisked away by the vampires and was constantly being moved as Blade and his new weapons ally, Scud, tracked them across the world.  Blade finally frees Whistler and the three find their hideout under attack by some vampire warriors.  However the warriors are only bringing a message to Blade from the leader of the vampires.  They are proposing a truce as something far worse than Blade has begun hunting them.  A new breed of vampires known as Reapers have mutated and begun attacking vampires.  Unfortunately a bite from a Reaper tends to turn the attacked vampire into a new Reaper with the urge to kill more vampires.  Typically this wouldn't bother Blade but once the vampires are gone, humanity would be the next prey. \tBlade agrees to lead a group of warrior known as The Bloodpack against the Reapers.  The irony here occurs in that the Bloodpack has spent the better part of two years training to fight their new leader.  The pack on a whole is anonymous with two standing out, Reinhardt played by Ron Perlman is their deposed leader and Nyssa played by Leonor Varela carries a secret which will unfold throughout the movie. \tThe first meeting of Blade's group doesn't go near as well as they hoped since they discover most of the typical weapons against vampires are now useless.  Through some research they discover the main weapon, sunlight, still works and set about making new weapons. \tThe final battle against the Reapers carries some consequences unforeseen and then treachery strikes Blade with the actual villain being revealed. \tThis movie is heavily action oriented, is about a vampire hunter, and is quite gory.  If those things turn you off, don't go see this movie.  If, on the other hand, you don't mind those, you will most likely find this an entertaining movie.  Spanish Director Guillermo del Toro brings a dark, macabre look to this film.  His Reapers are as different from vampires as vampires from humanity.  Their look is stylized and fresh.  Their method of attack must be seen to be believed.  His pacing of the movie is right on pace with possibly more action than the original yet still maintaining some semblance's of an adequate plot. \tThe actors tend to be what makes this movie.  Many people see Wesley in only action roles and don't realize that he can act.  Here he handles the action sequences superbly and has an understated method for delivering his lines in the best possible manner.  He gets off many worthy of laughs.
