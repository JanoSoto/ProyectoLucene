Then look no further than Amélie, an odd little French film from French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet. Amélie is the title character of the story. She is a curious and naive young girl who takes a lot of enjoyment out of life's little pleasures. One night she finds a box full of knick knacks in her apartment that had been left there fifty years ago by a little boy. She tracks down this boy, who is now obviously a man, and returns the box to him. Upon seeing his reaction Amélie decides that she wants to devote her life to helping the people around her, only to discover that she has lost sight of helping herself. It is a strange little story that is fairly melancholy and leaves one with a fairly underwhelmed state of mind. At least that's how I felt.This is by no means a bad film. In fact it is very good, there just isn't a whole lot to it. It's fairly melancholy and low key, in its own uniquely quirky way. I enjoyed watching it for the most part, but nothing really stood out for me, or struck me as remarkable. By the end of the film I just sort of shrugged and said, OK. That was good, but nothing life changing. The film does have a lot of subtext and motifs that carry throughout the film, that all mainly relate back to enjoying the simpler things in life. The film takes life one step at a time and just sort of diddles along, not really amounting to much. I feel like all this is intentional, and thats why I don't really want to knock this film for doing this. I was just personally expecting more out of an interesting concept and the unique visual style that Jeunet uses in this film. But overall what is delivered is a simple film that is devoted to its message, and definitely has more intelligence than the average film. But again, it doesn't really amount to much and by the time it was over I was satisfied and amused, but not blown away or heavily impacted.However, what did truly astound me in a good way was this films visuals. The direction here is very quirky and very peculiar, but also very unique. There are all sorts of strange little quirks that Jeunet throws into the film visually. They aren't really things that can be explained in words, or without a lot of context, but everything that Jeunet does in this film works very well and gives the whole film a very fun and very frivolous atmosphere. I suppose the best adjective to describe the visuals would be artsy, as moments of this film are shot in a very stylistic way with a lot of uniqueness to the visual design, essentially making this film a work of contemporary art. It is something very unique, thus hard to put into words so you really have to see for yourself.Visually this film is excellent and everywhere else it is just sort of there. Everything this film does, it does well, but it doesn't seem to do much and nothing about the film amounts to a whole lot. To say this is a bad film or it is poorly made would be a grotesque lie. This is an overall very good film, but it isn't something I would ever watch again, and the only thing I can really see sticking with me would be the artistic flare the film applies so well to every scene.

The fallen crew member is taken back to the mother ship for help and this becomes the precursor for all hell to break loose. Although by now near legendary, I will refrain from revealing more for any new viewers.There are those that dismiss this film as being a glorified big-budget retread of It! The Terror from Beyond Space, but the film is infinitely more than that. I choose to think of it more as a rendition of Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None set in outer space with a far more frightening nemesis than anything Christie imagined.A lot must be said about the style and realism of the film. I believe this may well have been the first (or at least one of the first) science fiction films where the heroes were blue-collar workers rather than the proverbial scientists. The dialog and interaction among the various crew members is believable and engaging. H.R. Giger's alien designs are much-celebrated for a reason and very few have been able to come up with something as continually shocking. The creature is seen in various stages of evolution, with each one being a repellent yet oddly hypnotic realization.Director Ridley Scott provides the tense and unrelenting atmosphere of the film. He also paces the film to perfection. It starts off slowly with a sense of creeping dread and then Scott ratchets up the suspense to a near unbearable crescendo. We are allowed to get to know each character and their quirks and share in their terror as they realize that their unwanted stowaway is a lot more dangerous and intelligent than they imagined. Scott makes effortless use of the dank dark confines of the spaceship, with its dripping water\/coolant, tight spaces, oddly shaped doorways and clanking chains. It chronically seems as though something unspeakable is always on the verge of jumping out at one of the characters. Interestingly, although the film has a reputation for being violent - after the notorious chest-buster scene, Scott keeps the remainder of the deaths largely offscreen.The cast fit well into their roles, with Tom Skerritt's stalwart captain and Ian Holm's icy scientist especially notable. However, acting-wise the film is deservedly known for allowing the previously unknown Sigourney Weaver to burst onto screens as the ever-resourceful, cool and intelligent Ellen Ripley. Ripley initially (and wisely) blends into the ensemble cast, but as the film progresses it becomes apparent that she will be the one to watch and will be the biggest obstacle to the alien. The fact that Weaver is also quite sympathetic and identifiable certainly helps the audience root for her.The final moments of the film are sublimely exciting. The film was followed by James Cameron's equally legendary sequel, which struck out into new territory and became a classic in its own right and also cemented Weaver as an action heroine.

I bet they did, but that didn't stop Destination Moon from handling the subject with the most earnest of touches. Its serious science fiction, researched fact mixed with sober speculation and served up with a dollop of right wing attitude. I can't say as I think this one has aged terribly well in many aspects other than its effects sequences actually, though I found it broadly watchable enough. For starters I wasn't sold on the political attitude. The anti Commie slant is fair enough and not something I would expect to be given serious treatment, but I thought rather less of the idea of free enterprise bypassing the law and then being applauded when they succeeded, indeed I found it rather too simplistic. The film brings up the notion of public opinion being agitated against the idea of an atomic rocket, which is interesting, but never dwelt upon, there is mention of the possibility of a saboteur when an early rocket explodes, this is also never dwelt upon, most importantly in terms of characters little discussion goes into the possibilities of danger for the land around the site should the mission go wrong, other than that it has been evacuated. Now, I don't generally like to get into politics in cinema but here it stands out, as the writing isn't up to much, the acting is mediocre and the events too sparsely exciting. Everything seems more concerned with asserting grandeur and importance of the mission and then putting some scientific accuracy on screen, rather than drawing interesting characters to invest the audience in events or stirring up excitement. Having said this, the emphasis on accuracy is pretty interesting in itself, especially when contrasted with the lunacies of so many fellow science fiction films of the time. Destination Moon is really the result of smart minds doing their best to come up with an absolutely plausible account of man landing on the Moon and its remarkably prescient stuff, from plans of the later Apollo missions to even the first words spoken on the eventual landing in 1969. Everything comes across accurate and the special effects are excellent (they bagged an Oscar) with fun depictions of weightlessness and low gravity, some ace matte painting work and shuttle take off excitement. Cast-wise no one impresses too much and Dick Wesson irritates in a lamely written everyman role, but things just about hold together until the lightly suspenseful end. Altogether I wasn't a big fan of this one, its respectable and probably a worthy watch for the serious science fiction fan but it isn't all that much fun. A fair 5\/10 from me then.

In this regard, perhaps depression is designed to reduce the social influence of the depressed individual, even in extreme cases leading to their permanent removal through premature death. The reason why this is useful is obvious suicide is a far less stressful (for the tribe) method of getting rid of malfunctioning members than murder.This suggests that depression is merely a suicide switch, the macroscopic version of cell apoptosis (programmed cell death), that can be thrown by our tribe when our deaths or dis-empowerment are necessary for the good of the group. This would correlate well with the observation that depression is more likely during the onset of resource-poor conditions (e.g. winter) when the tribe may need to cull members, and less likely under emergency small-group lifeboat conditions, when every member is urgently needed.But what is it about these individuals that would be evolutionary beneficial if they were removed from the tribe? And if suicidal persons are so harmful to society, then why are those who contemplate suicide often high achievers? This opens up a whole can of existential questions, most of them linked with the correlation between depression and IQ. Some studies show that depressed individuals are likely to have higher IQs than supposedly more balanced people (the association stops once you get beyond a certain IQ range). The more intelligent a person is, the more likely they are going to see the world for what it truly is. Nature doesn't want this, of course. Camus himself offered that perhaps it is people who are always cheerful, happy, etc. that are in possession of mental disorders, as they are constantly upholding a false sense of reality. In contrast, the depressed person has the ability to rise out of the human fantasy and enter a sort of morbid reality.But we have to be careful not to romanticise depression\/suicide. Suicide is always the result of an organism's inability to construct a future, and most who contemplate self-destruction are actually not smart enough to work their way out of their problems. Indeed, recently neuroscientists have begun linking suicide not to IQ, but to selective attention and executive functions, or what psychologist Michael Posner calls cognitive control. The idea is simply that depressed\/suicidal brains have weaker executive functions and are unable to block out things like normal people are able to.But assuming that IQ\/giftedness and suicide correlate (studies are conflicting), even intelligent persons who are able to think their way out of suicide &#x96; and suicidal persons are notoriously deep thinkers &#x96; often get caught in a dangerous limbo. Though sufficiently gifted to ponder an issue and come to a conclusion of action, this action itself brings with it a whole other set of issues and problems associated with executing that action. This is why people who contemplate suicide, but never act out on it, often getting caught in an even deeper depression, their minds spiralling into thought, constantly imagining every possible outcome to a particular situation. Eventually the individual shuts itself down and does nothing entirely, opting instead to shelter themselves from the insecurity of not knowing the outcome. End result a sort of stasis.This has led other thinkers suggesting that there is a correlation between suicide and control. That the mind thinks itself into lock-down (depression=evolution trying to slow the brain, some suggest) because it realises it can never calculate the extent of its own autonomy. The suicidal brain, in other words, cannot cope with both chaos and the limits of its own agency, a trauma which normal brains have adapted to blank out.Then you have issues of suicide as a larger social failure; the possible result of a society\/government\/economic-model\/set-of-cultural-mores which is itself toxic (in MEDC's, suicide is the second leading cause of death amongst young people). That's Antonioni territory. On a more positive note, many successful people have self-analysed themselves and turned suicide\/depression into an advantage.

Contrast it with the turgid, long-winded 2011 HBO version of 'Pierce'. There's actually no comparison the 1945 version is wholly entertaining while the recent adaptation will bore you to tears.Mildred Pierce was the perfect vehicle for Joan Crawford. Ironically here she plays a mother whose love is pretty much unconditional toward her bad seed daughter Veda (in real life, however, Crawford used 'tough love' on her own children with disastrous results). Unlike the novel (and the recent HBO Version), the noirish murder scene constitutes the inciting incident and linchpin of the entire plot.The break into the Second Act begins during the police interrogation as Mildred recounts her break up with husband Bert and quest for financial independence. When a waitress is fired during an argument with another waitress over tips, Mildred just happens to be in the right place at the right time and is hired on the spot. It's these neat little scenes that add to the overall verisimilitude of the plot.Act two introduces us to Mildred's conflict with Wally, Bert's former real estate partner and daughter Veda. As for Wally--he's distinctively played by Jack Carson as the seedy salesman who can't resist trying to putting his paws all over Mildred (he's a serial groper!). Ann Blyth is brilliant, making the most of the chief supporting players' part, as the evil Veda. The character is so over the top that one can scarcely believe there are people like this in real life. Veda can't control her contempt for her mother and yes teenagers often do rebel against parental authority; but the disdain is usually a lot more subtle than what we see here. Still, Veda's exaggerated (and escalating) misbehavior is what makes the film so enjoyable (there is a catharsis of sorts as the audience gets to 'hiss the villain').If there is one sentimental sequence 'Mildred Pierce', it's when younger daughter Ray contracts pneumonia and dies. The scene is a bit drawn out but provides an explanation for Mildred's continuing attachment to Veda&#x97;the loss of Ray causes Mildred to try and protect the only child she has left! The stakes get higher in Act 2. Monte is temporarily thrown 'under the bus' when he refuses Mildred's request not to indulge Veda and stay away from her. Then Veda goes ahead and cons her new husband and his mother out of $10,000 by pretending that she's pregnant. There's that great iconic scene where Veda ends up slapping Mildred and she throws her out of the house. Meanwhile, Mildred finds success in the restaurant business by opening up a chain of restaurants. Should I mention that Mildred's former supervisor Ida (deliciously played by Eve Arden) is the comic relief with her sassy comments about men. Leave it to kind-hearted Bert (who finally has gotten his act together), to bring Veda and Mildred back together. This happens when he brings Mildred to a seedy nightclub where Veda now works as a low rent singer.The dark moment of Act 2 occurs after Mildred agrees to marry Monte and give him one third of the business (she does this to perhaps improve her social standing in Veda's eyes). Monte betrays Mildred by selling his share of the business along with Wally, which bankrupts her. The ultimate indignity of course is that Monte begins an affair with Veda.What makes Mildred Pierce so engaging is that not only is Veda damaged goods but so is Mildred. She's willing to send an innocent man to jail to save her daughter when she tries to set up Wally as the killer.Note that the story is not without a few false notes.

The scene is a bit drawn out but provides an explanation for Mildred's continuing attachment to Veda&#x97;the loss of Ray causes Mildred to try and protect the only child she has left! The stakes get higher in Act 2. Monte is temporarily thrown 'under the bus' when he refuses Mildred's request not to indulge Veda and stay away from her. Then Veda goes ahead and cons her new husband and his mother out of $10,000 by pretending that she's pregnant. There's that great iconic scene where Veda ends up slapping Mildred and she throws her out of the house. Meanwhile, Mildred finds success in the restaurant business by opening up a chain of restaurants. Should I mention that Mildred's former supervisor Ida (deliciously played by Eve Arden) is the comic relief with her sassy comments about men. Leave it to kind-hearted Bert (who finally has gotten his act together), to bring Veda and Mildred back together. This happens when he brings Mildred to a seedy nightclub where Veda now works as a low rent singer.The dark moment of Act 2 occurs after Mildred agrees to marry Monte and give him one third of the business (she does this to perhaps improve her social standing in Veda's eyes). Monte betrays Mildred by selling his share of the business along with Wally, which bankrupts her. The ultimate indignity of course is that Monte begins an affair with Veda.What makes Mildred Pierce so engaging is that not only is Veda damaged goods but so is Mildred. She's willing to send an innocent man to jail to save her daughter when she tries to set up Wally as the killer.Note that the story is not without a few false notes. How can the police arrest Bert at the beginning of the film? Yes, they have his gun and no denial that he was responsible; but they don't actually have a confession, so the evidence seems rather flimsy. Then there's the ending itself&#x97;the murder feels a bit tacked on as if the screenwriter couldn't come up with something more creative and needed to rush things to an almost immediate conclusion. It's really not much of a twist as Monte's murder seems rather predictable.Despite the minor pitfalls, 'Mildred Pierce' remains a highly entertaining part noir, part soap opera, that manages to thrill audiences even to this day.

Hard to say, but you can't beat Cleopatra for sheer spectacle, opulence, majesty, and costumes! And for those of us who grew up in the '60s, let us not forgot that Cleopatra makeup we all walked around with.There are also some wonderful performances in this film, notably Rex Harrison as Caesar, Richard Burton as Marc Antony, Roddy McDowell as Octavian -- and let's not forget the perfectly cast Elizabeth Taylor, gorgeous and resplendent and certainly believable as both queen and seductress.The film sticks to the true history, with the exception of the children Cleopatra had with Marc Antony -- four in all, including twins. The only child shown in the film, Caesarian, didn't outlive his mother by much, as Octavian had him killed after Caesarian won support as Pharaoh of Egypt.Since the film took so long to make, one does notice differences in Taylor's appearance, particularly her weight. In the scenes filmed after her illness, she is quite tiny and in the scenes beforehand, she is a little bigger. Since the scenes seem to have been filmed out of order, it can be disconcerting. Let's face it, it's hard to stay at the same weight for five years, particularly after you've nearly died. None of it is enough to detract from her great beauty.Cleopatra eventually made more than $44 million, but that doesn't mean it actually turned a profit. In order to show a profit, usually a film needs to make three times its cost. I don't believe to this day that Cleopatra has ever done that. No matter - it was the start of a huge love affair and was yet another coffin nail in the big studio system. And with all of that, it's a well-made film that doesn't scrimp on opulence.

The film deals with a number of issues and handles them with meticulous craftsmanship. It is a masterpiece in every aspects ranging from storyline to technical sophistry. This review will be focused on various necessary aspects of the film but there will be no commentary over it as an adaptation. The discussion will cover its plot, characters, technical elements, sound and theme.The setting of the film is 1920s China. Songlian (Gong Li) is an educated girl who had to marry a rich feudal patriarch because of her mother's will when her father dies. She therefore becomes the fourth mistress of the family that maintains traditions and its orthodoxy rigorously. She finds herself within a suffocating confinement. Her sole focus is narrowed down to get the attention of the master likewise the other sisters. Interestingly; along with physical satisfaction, the wives' charm in the house seems to rest on getting the foot massage which is given to the particular wife with whom the master will be 'spending' his night. Songlian is a quick learner who starts tricking and fooling other sisters just like the way they do. She builds a good relationship with the second wife (Cao Cuifen) and does not quiet get along with the third one. With a number of twisting discoveries, Songlian keeps on gaming until she uncovers something grave in a state of drunkenness in her 20th birthday.The character of Songlian is the most craftily characterized one in the film. While other characters, especially second and third wives are seen to be only fussily engaged in grabbing the master's attention, Songlian projects an amazing amount of sentimentality, sensibility, anger and calculability. Songlian's maid is also an important character who is characterized to a credible degree. Within a confinement of rules, traditions and orthodoxy; Songlian and her maid have expressions that are praiseworthy. The master and First wife's son Feipu plays a precise but significant role. Other characters serve up to their demand of the plot. This is one of the very few films where there are no unnecessary characters. Moreover, the acting is superb.The film has brilliant editing and incredibly meticulous cinematography. Kudos must be given to the cinematographer Yang Lun and Zhao Fei. The cinematography is so amazingly mathematical that it turns out to be a work of art. The precision reminds of Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin and some of its legendary cinematography. Editing is very smooth and the superimposition in the last sequence are also uncannily perfect. The screenplay deserves a bow. It's literally hard to find any flaws in the technical sector of the film.The film uses very little sound. The songs of the Third Mistress are enchanting. The introductory music which is repeated several times in the film is very purposive and upholds the stereotypical fact that it is a Chinese film.The film deals with a number of themes. There is something graver than mere sentimentality because it must not be forgotten that this film was banned by the Chinese Government. The film has all the dramatic themes necessary to make a film attractive. But the main theme of the film serves as a critique of Confucianism that means it is a satire of the theory of a good family. Songlian's condition by the end of the film can be a critical psychoanalytical reading.To be conclusive, the film is a must watch for both film critics and movie-goers. The film critics will surely find this to be a soothing experience. On the other hand, movie-goers will surely have a good time.

At just under 100 minutes maybe it's a little long but there's enough going on to keep ones interest even if the murder mystery may be a little easy to figure out & a bit too improbable to take seriously.

Also the ending features a little overkill when it comes to the villain dying as he comes back from apparently being dead at least four times in ten minutes!There are some good action set-pieces here including a great car chase with one of my personal favourite moments from any chase from any film when the cars start jumping over those humps & shoot up in the air one behind the other. There are boat chases, shoot-outs, fights & a bit of suspense as a mystery killer stalks & kills a few people too. Nicely enough shot there's not much style here but it looks alright.With a supposed budget of about $30,000,000 this has the usual glossy Hollywood production values & is well made. There's a very good cast here including Bruce Willis, Dennis Farina, Tom Sizemore, Brion James & Tom Atkins with the only weak link the ever awful Sarah Jessica Parker in an early role.Striking Distance is a pretty good action thriller, it has a reasonable murder mystery, some clichéd cop drama & some good action scenes. It's certainly no worse than a lot of routine Hollywood action thrillers, you could do a lot worse.

First off, all the clues are there to follow if you look for them the second go around in this movie. Everything from quotes on patient's rooms (all of a sudden it will hit you) to the voices Gordon hears at the beginning of the movie, to the peanut butter jar that hank finds. This might be my personal opinion, but it seems that Gordon is mentally ill, just like Mary was in the recordings. Once you find out what Simon is (the evil identity in Mary) you can draw the parallel to Gordon. While I don't think you can read more into this parallel, it just helps explain the path that Gordon took, just as the same path Mary took to end up in the hospital. I believe the stress of Gordon's job (he's financially in trouble as he almost had to close down shop as stated early in the movie) paired with not wanting to be a father (again, stated early) led Gordon to develop a second identity that ended up killing his wife, daughter, and co workers. It's a simple storyline that uses a parallel story to help fill in what the director doesn't show us. It was wonderfully done and requires some thought, as well as a close eye and ear to catch all of the smaller points in order to piece everything together. The use of the parallel storyline can cause a lot of debate into whether or not Gordon was possessed by the Simon demon but I truly believe that the director intended to use the Mary plot line in order to explain Gordon, simply because Gordon could not explain himself. He was not aware of what he had done, thinking he merely hit his wife, when in reality, Gordon (or Gordon's second identity) killed his family. His unawareness is also shown when he calls his wife to try and talk to her, further showing his dementia. At this point Gordon has disassociated with real life and is now only seeing half of the story. The final quote from Simon is that he lives in the weak and wounded. I also do not believe that this literally means the wounded (as Gordon's burn, or Mary's scars from the fall), rather I believe that it refers to the weak and wounded mind. A wonderful thought provoking movie that used a brilliant setting to make the movie work perfectly. The soundtrack is silently eerie, but has a huge impact throughout the movie, and throughout the movie a less is more feel encompasses the entire production. It works perfectly.

They are outgoing to the point of extreme annoyance. This familiarity made me immediately view the character more three dimensionally.When Bruno finally reveals his plan to Guy, I found myself thinking that it was a relatively good plan. By making both the antagonist and his scheme believable, I was locked in for the rest of the movie. Robert Walker does a tremendous job of playing the complex Bruno. He is anything but a one-note character. While he came across as somewhat silly at times, I found Bruno to be a pretty scary villain due to his unpredictability. Farley Granger's performance wasn't as strong to me, but he managed to hold his ground with Walker. Hitchcock does what he does best in this picture and creates suspense even in scenes where you think everything is fine. The most chilling scene in the entire movie to me occurred in broad daylight.

Eventually, however, he gives in to Betsy's entreaties and agrees to go back on his promise. The two arrange to get married in Las Vegas, but on arrival in the city another obstacle presents itself. Betsy catches the eye of a wealthy professional gambler named Tommy Korman because she reminds him of his late wife. After winning $65,000 from Jack in a crooked poker game, Korman agrees to forgive the debt if Jack will allow him to spend the weekend with Betsy.The situation is somewhat reminiscent of that from another film from the early nineties, Indecent Proposal, in which a wealthy man offers a young married couple $1,000,000 to spend a night with the wife. Indecent Proposal, however, was intended as a serious drama, whereas Honeymoon in Vegas is played for laughs. Moreover, in Indecent Proposal the young woman, played by Demi Moore, was expected to sleep with Robert Redford's millionaire; here, Betsy only (reluctantly) agrees to go along with Korman's proposal on a strict no sex basis. Nevertheless, during the weekend they spend in Hawaii, Betsy finds herself falling for Korman. Can Jack win her back? With his lanky figure and long, lugubrious-looking face, Nicolas Cage does not really have the looks of a Hollywood leading man, but here he seems admirably suited to the role of Jack, the sort of lovable if eccentric loser who eventually turns out to be a winner, and deservedly so because for all his faults and eccentricities he is basically decent. In the final scene Jack has to make a parachute jump from 3,000 feet with a team of skydiving Elvis impersonators in order to reach Betsy before Korman can marry her. This struck me as a modern, comic take on all those old legends in which a hero or knight-errant has to perform some brave feat in order to win the hand of a fair lady. James Caan's Korman, by contrast, might initially seem affable, but beneath a jovial exterior he has a mean streak a mile wide, a streak which starts to show as soon as anyone crosses him. As they say, lucky at cards, unlucky in love.I was less taken with Sarah Jessica Parker, perhaps because I am so used to her as the hard, brassy Carrie Bradshaw from Sex and the City that it was difficult for me to accept her as a softer character like Betsy.

So you have the fantasy of a celebrity falling in love with a regular guy, of the chivalrous knight rescuing the princess, of being the strong silent type who can't help it that ladies (and their kids and sisters) fall for you, and for the ladies, you have a man dedicating his life to defending you, your nest and your kids.The film was directed by Mick Jackson, a television director. His direction is plain, but the film channels well the tone of 1960s\/1970s crime movies (Point Blank, anything by Siegel, Peckinpah, Steve McQueen etc). Whitney Houston and Kevin Costner are our stars, he doing a monosyllabic Steve McQueen routine, she a bit abrasive in front of the camera. Their romance is underwritten.Bodyguard movies were all the rage in the late 80s\/early 90s, think Terminator 2, The Specialist, In The Line Of Fire etc. Why is this?

The movie is quite faithful to the book, although the film gives comparatively more attention to the Sara Waybourne character and less attention to Irma Leopold.I highly recommend considering the rock a character - perhaps the most important character - in this film; I ask you to consider that the rock is not a static, dumb object as we would interpret it from our modern, materialistic viewpoint. Rather, by accepting a more aboriginal, animist interpretation of the rock as a living being, the viewer gets in tune with a different understanding of the underlying reality of things which should make it easier to comprehend and appreciate this film. In connection, it also may be helpful to remember Australia is a continent which was stolen away from the native inhabitants by Europeans, who fancied their culture more advanced, civilized and reality-based than the aboriginal culture; this European conquest has lasted for a tiny blip of a second when compared to how long the natives have lived there. Also, one of the cultural hallmarks of Christian Europe was the (at least partial) sublimation of sexuality in order to fuel presumably higher goals, for example, art such as this movie.On one level, Picnic at Hanging Rock is about the suffocating sexual repression of the Victorian age. The older students at this girls boarding school are just entering into that golden period of 16 to 24 years old, that fleeting period when humans are at their most vigorous, fertile, robust, sensual and beautiful. This makes the repression all the more crucial. There are clues sprinkled into the movie to help the viewer make up their own mind as to what happens, but you have to pay careful attention this is not a Hollywood style movie where you're hit over the head with plot developments or character motivations in high relief, nor is every question that arises clearly answered in a reassuring, formulaic way. If you like easy answers, forget this movie and watch a Hollywood flick.Most of the cast is solidly good. Dominic Guard as Michael Fitzhubert and Anne Lambert as Miranda are perfect choices for their facial features, physical build, and mannerisms. I would have cast the character of Irma Leopold differently. In the book, she is described repeatedly as stunningly beautiful, and although the actress who plays her in the movie is quite attractive, she is not stunningly beautiful.One of the girls quotes Poe All that we see or seem is but a dream within a dream. Another girl gushes, The rock has been waiting thousands of years, just for us! Ultimately this film is relevant to everyone alive on planet earth, because on this second level, Picnic at Hanging Rock is about that biggest mystery of all - being and nothingness.

First they were in 1941, then Blues Brother which happened to be one of my favorite and I give that one a 10 star rating, then The Great outdoors and then this. Chevy Chase play a guy named Chis who happened to be a very nice guy who one night while waiting outside of a New Jersy hotel and meets a very nice and pretty girl played by Demi Moore. They meet up, have a very nice and classy dinner and go and have a relaxing time in his room. The next morning the both decide to take a nice trip and also take along 2 yuppy couples who are also a bunch of wyners. The 4 of them leave the hotel and end up getting on the The turn pike to New Jersey and the next thing you know they end up taking a wrong turn and end up in this tiny creepy dry ghost town call Valkrey. Think of this as National Lampoons Vacation meets Beetlejuice. After they enter the town.They get pulled over by a police officer named Dennis played by John Candy. In 1991 John Candy play a cop in 2 movies. This and Only the loney which was way better then this. So officer Dennis decides to take the 4 of them to a creepy haunted mansion and they meet this like 180 year old judge named Alvin who is also a very creepy guy and if you didn't know that his nose is supposed to look like a human penis. He decides to sentence the 4 of them to spends theirs lives in the basement of the mansion. Everything in this movie is weird, disgusting and has no point of view. The rest of this movie about trying to escape which you should be doing from watching this movie. Candy also play Dennis overweight sister who does not talk in this movie. akyrod also plays this big fat baby named Humpy who is knda like Baby Huey.Food for thought I happened to have a very good taste in movies. This movie is not for those who have a smart taste in movies like Gone w the wind or E.T. This movies is for especitaly for teenage boys who enjoy insulting people, even teenage e girls and has a dirty mind like using fart jokes.

I first saw this movie when I was in school and I loved it. I then bought the VCD and I think that VCD was one that I ended up using regularly. After many years, I decided to watch it again. And I'll say this The magic hasn't been lost. I still love this film. It's amazing. Seriously.I'd like to believe that this movie can be enjoyed be anyone and everyone. I do believe in God, but I am not overly religious. However I still enjoyed this movie immensely. I think that even non-Christians or atheists will still enjoy this movie. This movie may scare children. I know I got creeped out by one or two parts when I was younger. But other than that, it's fine.I love the soundtrack of this movie. All the songs (except for one) fit in with the movie itself and helps make it perfect. The songs aren't at all distracting and they don't just happen out of the blue. There's build-up and the songs just really go with the flow of the movie. The songs actually MAKE the movie what it is.After watching this movie again after many years, I think that I was able to understand it more and I also got to really appreciate the brilliance of it. The characters, for instance, were really written well. Especially Rameses. (SPOILER) When I was younger, I hated Rameses. I thought that he was evil and deserved everything that happened to him. But now, I found that I was actually sympathizing with him. I mean, think about it. He was under a lot of pressure that was put onto him by his father. He just wanted to make his father proud by making Egypt great. Then suddenly, his brother, one that he grew up and shared many memories with, turns against him It must have been hard. I don't blame him for his actions. (\/SPOILER) He was a well-rounded coin. There were two sides of him. I think more movies need to make their villains like Rameses here.This film was brilliant. I can't think of a simpler way to put it. It's really moving and is just amazing. DreamWorks should make more movies like this. This could rival many of Disney's films and actually level with Pixar's.
