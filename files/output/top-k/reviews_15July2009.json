[{"date":"15 July 2009","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Ethan Powell (Antony Hopkins) is deported back to a US mental facility after his scientific work in Africa ends in a murder conviction. There he builds a wall of silence that needs to be broken down by new-boy shrink Theo Caulder (Cuba Gooding Jr).The central problem with worthy topics is that, while I salute their seriousness and gravity, that doesn't mean I automatically enjoy any product that wants to wrap itself in it. This film (a why-dun-nit) takes a small age to say anything or go anywhere and even when it does it is clearly a hodgepodge of other films best bits.(Let us not bother mentioning them again!)Hopkins is a fine actor and wonderfully intense - but wasted in this chewing-the-curtains epic. Yes, the prison system is wrong, but what should a prison for the criminal mentally-unstable look like? The Ritz? Equally here in the affluent West it is easy to sit back and condemn those living an uneducated hand-to-mouth existence in some jungle clearing.(Doesn't make them right though!) To be frank I was totally bored before the movie had reached the half way point and - by which point it had said everything it had to say and show - and I was hoping for the thing to finish as quickly as possible.Hollywood is part of most of the problems of this world (grab it, take it, snort it, ignore the safety of bystanders, solve-it -by-violence night-after-night) so when it gets preachy my ears tend to close. For the record the message is right - the medium is wrong. Thrillers have to thrill - this doesn't.
