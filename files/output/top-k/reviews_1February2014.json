I'll admit I don't much like him as an actor, particularly, but this has him as role I think he seems to suit. The film production is excellent, it's an attractive, slick looking film and it plays out less like rich people montages as the original does but there is an element of that.

Unsatisfied with assumptions that her daughter is soundly asleep, she climbs into her daughter's crib and pinches her. Ironically, Aurora acknowledges her daughter's safety by the screeching sounds of Emma crying. The 1983 Best Picture winner opens by showing us the spectrum of love and care. Aurora loves her daughter, but a tart, complicated love. I ultimately began to wonder does a child's need of being providing for from their parent outweigh the parent's need of psychological security and dependence from their child? When analyzing a film such as Terms of Endearment, one must keep in mind the portion size under investigation. Terms of Endearment may appear as a melodramatic novel adaptation if you hastily skim the overall product, but if you patiently watch each scene, the quality of filmmaking in the scope of any single scene is rich. Terms of Endearment takes one moment at a time, carefully collecting a group of consistently made scenes, molded by aced direction and existential writing. Director James L. Brooks fashions his film in a timid, yet melodramatic manner to string out big reactions from his audience. These moments are not necessarily cheap notions from Brooks to react by crying or laughing, but situational reactions, feeling as the characters feel in their predicaments. Yet, even in moments of high dramatic tones, there are instances of comedy that flow through the film's veins. The cast ensemble is lovely, stemming from the two performances at the helm. Terms of Endearment tends focus on Debra Winger's character, Emma, though her storyline is not as strong the one Nicholson and MacLaine share. Miss. Winger acts with youthful optimism and a happiness that is a joy to watch. Miss. MacLaine is granite hard and ice cold, but shares Aurora's misguided love in shades and holds acting experience over her co-star. You need to do a lot drinking to kill the bug you have up your ass, says Jack Nicholson's Garret Breedlove while flirtatiously interacting with Shirley MacLaine's Aurora. The two actors have alarming chemistry as wild trifles with arrogance. The two actors honored with Academy Awards for their performances form the film's best scenes, particularly when their characters embrace private moments. Nicholson's electric screen presence is an added excitement to the female-rooted project. Aurora refers to Garret as entertaining, a fitting description of Nicholson's performance. The reputation Terms of Endearment holds as a Best Picture winner could be doubted due to two possible criticisms. It is actually surprising to me that a film where a mother steers and a daughter applies the gas drove to the finish line of the Best Picture and Best Director races at the Academy Awards. This is the type of film that could be written off as a sentimental chick flick and left only honoring the emotional work of the actors. For a feminist, Terms of Endearment is a benchmark on Oscar roadmaps. The second criticism is what took away merit from my approving reaction. Unsavory bursts of sentiment derived from Lifetime movies appear in Terms of Endearment on more than one occasion, not enough to leave a substantial negative impact, but plenty to take note of. I blame the musical score for creating this problem. For most of the picture, the score finely matches what the film intends to say, other times it forces our hand in dancing to a tune we are too old and experienced to even hear. The ending will famously break you heart, like a cafeteria lady slapping a dollop of emotional syrup on your tray at lunchtime in school. Terms of Endearment is sappy, but never-the-less shows a mother's protection of her child can be optimistically sour.

The plot doesn't make any sense. Sacrifice the whole rescue unit for sake of one's paratrooper's life? Seriously? Stop pretending to be noble here and answer a simple question Is a search for one man (not rescue exactly) worth risking lives of a whole squad? Furthermore, how can someone expect of a small unit, which consists of bunch of infantrymen, to find one man in such a vast area? There was a big mess after attack of allied paras. They were spread all over the place with heavy loses. Some reviewer wrote here the idea to call 101st on radio to pull Ryan back. I think that would be the best thing to do.This movie is unbelievably insulting. The Germans are portrayed way too cartoonish like blood-thirsty animals (Americans are the good guys of course) and completely inept enemy at the same time, which of course wasn't true in most cases. The Germans were a tough enemy in spite of the fact that most of their soldiers were not equipped and trained well as in the earlier years. What all of you people who think the portrayal of Germans in this movie is realistic is the reason the war lasted so long?! Just bad luck and weather? No way. Some reviewers wrote that there is nothing stupid about Germans here because they made mistakes like slow reaction to the D-day or wrong estimation of the invasion's spot. That is true but it has nothing to do with quality of individual soldiers. That is not a justification for showing elite units including SS panzer gruppen as complete idiots!The American saviors were just refusing to die each time a shootout emerged. Yes, they were killed finally but should be dead much earlier. You are supposed to sympathize with our bunch of American action characters but I just hated everyone of them. Spielberg wants us to think that they are battle hardened soldiers, but I had the feeling they are just kids playing some war game (except for the interpreter, who was totally unnecessary character btw., acting annoyingly cowardly for no reason in the whole movie). I was bored for most of the time after the first sequence. The way the unit moves behind enemy lines looks like a walk in Central Park. One German with machine gun in the right position could easily wipe out at least half of the unit because they didn't keep any type of formation which should have prevent this.The final scene is so incredibly stupid that I doubt about common sense of those who spoke well about this one. You see German attackers running back and forth without covering fire or support in front of American barrels! Germans even don't try to find any kind of cover!! They even hardly return any fire!!! It's like shooting range for American soldiers or some kind of PC game. Looks like every dead American takes at least 100 Germans to hell with him. Kids, if you like this sequence, I have bad news for you. The war doesn't look like this. You hardly see anything more than enemy soldier's head and his gun when combat occurs and of course the kills are not so easy to get. On the other hand the Americans also run uncovered many times but with some ability to dodge bullets or something like that. That is the only explanation of my own for their immortality. In reality they would have been killed instantly if they would behave in such way as shown in this sequence, for example running in front of PzKpfw tiger which has manually operated machine gun at the front. The rules which apply to Germans somehow don't apply to Americans. The tactics performed by both allies and axis here is laughable. Germans wouldn't enter a town with tanks ahead and infantry behind them because the tanks are vulnerable in urban areas. Their strength is placed in the open. The attack on the radar station is weird as well. The defenders were surely part of a bigger group. It is obvious that after killing the defenders the Americans should retire using Hit and run tactics because other Germans could enter a fight. Instead of it, they argue on the very spot they've just captured about a sense of their mission like there is nothing to worry about (it would have been clear to an orangutan from a very beginning that this mission sucks). Just stupid. I could go on like this and mention for example shooting 7 shots from 5 round rifle without reloading and so on but I will skip it.

Then along came this adventure based around the magic of Greek mythology and I was hooked. An animated Disney version of Harryhausen's mythic visions? count me in. So off I went on the day of release back in 1997, Swiss Cottage Odeon, North London (for some reason I remember, probably because this Odeon was unusually HUGE!).A simple tale of Hercules life from birth up to his teenage years. The loss of his immortality and God status at the hands of Hades, his young life as a mortal and how he manages to become a God again with the help of various friends in typical wide eyed Disney manner.The two things that attracted me to this kiddie flick were 1. the Greek mythology as already said, and 2. the visuals on display. Disney seem to go through different styles over time and this films style is really nice in its stark angled way. It comes across like a Geddy Tartakovsky project, reminiscent of his 'Star Wars Clone Wars' series but with less CGI and generally a bit softer in tone. The colour palette is really vibrant too, so rich and alive, its really beautiful to watch going from the warm pastel golds, yellows and beige of Mount Olympus and Thebes to dark shades of blues, purples and black of the underworld. Loved the underworld!, wanted more time down there.Apart from the animation the characters are a big part of any film like this and would it be any surprise if I told you the bad guy was the best?. Yep its true, once again the villain shines through and in this case James Woods makes Hades a very likable guy. Not only does he look really cool with a brilliant design and a virtually monochromatic colour scheme, he also has a really awesome flaming blue hairdo which is such a sweet touch. It is of course the deadpan sarcastic fiery verbal from Woods that he's famous for and he doesn't disappoint here...minus the profanity of course. The only other character that stood out for me was Philoctetes perfectly voiced by De Vito, casting genius. In general the Gods all looked quite good visually but I was unsure about that heavenly glow they all had, I see what they were going for but it kinda looked tacky. The Titans were a tad cliché looking (dunno what I expected) and didn't blow me away, also a shame they used full CGI for the Hydra which looked awful. Not sure why Hercules was drawn the way he was because he looked a bit pug ugly to me, anyone notice how big his ears were?!. Also I didn't really like the little imp minions of Hades, typical stereotypical Disney sidekicks purely in there for silly laughs, oh wait its a kids flick isn't it...dang!.Talking about the Hydra, not sure how that worked, Hercules was cutting off its heads one after another yet it kept on coming back for more. In the end some falling rocks killed it? even though it had its heads cut off multiple times?. On the same note, Hercules is suppose to have retained his super strength BUT he's mortal (watch the film), yet in the film he's still comes across as immortal even after that was drained from him.All in all I did enjoy this Greek outing as I expected I would. Yeah sure its not perfect by any means, the animation is a wee bit dated now naturally but I can't complain about that really. The CGI moments were obvious and terrible...down to age again. I didn't like the soppy songs throughout, yeah I know its Disney but they really felt unnecessary and jammed in...plus they sucked!. I really think these lovey-dovey songs are no longer required for these type of films, its a very old fashioned concept which to be honest I'm glad is fading out...call me uncultured I guess.

( *SOME POTENTIAL MILD SPOILERS BELOW*) 1st off, It's a Disney film. now we all know Disney is a lot more liberal these days on what they can and can't show and say. Disney films are riddled with dark humour especially new ones like Despicable Me etc, but back when Hocus Pocus was about, there really wasn't many films alike at that time, which is why it stands out to me, it really went heavy on the content & still hit the PG rating. within the first 10-15 minutes you see a girl get the life sucked out of her, directly after that you see Witches getting hanged, by the time the witches return from the dead, words like Virgin are being thrown around, And he's a Virgin Are you a Virgin? surely at some point some kid is going to ask his parents what a virgin is! A spell book with an eyeball in it, given to Winnie by the devil himself, in Satan's house, the wife calls Sarah Tart Face and the whole tone of the film is really extreme for a family friendly Halloween film. I'm not complaining about these things, they are what made it for me, to this day they still stand out and i don't know how Disney got away with it. Think that Kenny Ortega is doing High School Musical etc now, it's totally different to what Hocus Pocus was like, most people don't actually believe hocus Pocus is Disney when i bring it up in conversation. (Continued Review) The casting was brilliant, Sarah Jessica Parker looks out of this world then compared to now, they look so different, she was beautiful in this, Bette Middler just nailed the character of Winnie so well, all of them were buck mad, eccentric and over the top and zany! I don't know how they were able to get into that crazy mode and speak the way they did, it's certainly not an American Accent I heard off them, it was just undesirable! It's fun for Adults, and it's fun for kids, it really isn't scary, however everything from the movie soundtrack, to the script and set pieces and not to mention incredible special effects all go perfectly. They touch a wee bit on the whole Macbeth 3 witches thing, the big bubbling cauldron, zombies, magic, talking cats, it's just brilliant. You see movies like Harry Potter today and see him whizzing round the Quidditch Match on like a manual broom with a green screen on it, or even completely computer generated at some points and compare it to these witches flying, on wires the proper way, you can see they are flying for real there, no trickery, that's why it's perfect for me, they tried to do as many things as real as possible.The movie is just so much fun, I seriously believe it's underrated, and I think that some other movies tried to take little bits out of Hocus Pocus, like look at Rohl Daul's The Witches, first off, the very opening scene? it has a camera high in the air flying over white snowy mountains as the credits role, i'm sorry but that had nothing to do witches because none of the witches flew in that movie, in Hocus Pocus however, there is a camera high in the air flying over Salem, with a witches silhouette, it just seemed too similar as if they were nudging towards Hocus Pocus, oh and as for Casper Meets Wendy? three witches round a big dry ice filled cauldron, one witch peering out the window, the other one making jokes to the more aggressive leader witch, and then she says things like Ugh, What did i do to deserve sisters like this? ...

You see movies like Harry Potter today and see him whizzing round the Quidditch Match on like a manual broom with a green screen on it, or even completely computer generated at some points and compare it to these witches flying, on wires the proper way, you can see they are flying for real there, no trickery, that's why it's perfect for me, they tried to do as many things as real as possible.The movie is just so much fun, I seriously believe it's underrated, and I think that some other movies tried to take little bits out of Hocus Pocus, like look at Rohl Daul's The Witches, first off, the very opening scene? it has a camera high in the air flying over white snowy mountains as the credits role, i'm sorry but that had nothing to do witches because none of the witches flew in that movie, in Hocus Pocus however, there is a camera high in the air flying over Salem, with a witches silhouette, it just seemed too similar as if they were nudging towards Hocus Pocus, oh and as for Casper Meets Wendy? three witches round a big dry ice filled cauldron, one witch peering out the window, the other one making jokes to the more aggressive leader witch, and then she says things like Ugh, What did i do to deserve sisters like this? ... Hocus Pocus Winnie - Why, Why Why was I cursed with such idiot sisters?!! ...If you ask me.. Hocus Pocus is the ULTIMATE WITCH FILM AND ALWAYS WILL BE!!!!!

The film gets really extreme with its exaggerated (perhaps cheesy) level of acting, its level of bloodshed, and its satire, but it's awesome that way.Most of the film's appeal, however, is that it's so fundamental and simple. It goes through a basic death-and-rebirth storyline, which provides the origin of the character and drives the rest of the story through retribution and corporate conspiracy. There is just enough attention to the characters to make them relevant and endearing.On top of that, however, the film also packs in a lot of thought-provoking ideas. Some of the funniest and most memorable scenes include faux news reports and commercials with a strong satirical edge, which provides more background on the crazy world RoboCop inhabits. The film breezes through numerous themes regarding capitalism, the mass media, gentrification, and overall dystopia.

In all honesty it probably was the very top film in this regard. I can still remember seeing it for the first time and being amazed. I had loved Quentin Tarantino's earlier Reservoir Dogs but thought he had upped the ante even higher with this movie. Seeing it again recently I have to say it remains an incredibly well made and entertaining bit of cinema. And even though I have enjoyed all of Tarantino's films since, there is no doubt in my mind that his three 90's crime films tower above all of his post millennium filmography. In those ones he seemed to integrate his obsession with pop cultural references into strong stories, as opposed to nowadays where his movie references have become so blatant and full on that they have become an actual handicap of sorts. Pulp Fiction is the movie where he best showcases his style in a movie that is consistently brilliant from start to finish.It's essentially three stories entwined. All on the face of it standard crime cinema tales where something goes wrong but Tarantino focuses on unusual details that make them completely original. The chief aspect that differentiates them from others is his brilliant dialogue that is never afraid to go on non-plot related diversions in ways that utterly humanises the thuggish bad guys that populate his film. The script is full of pop cultural references, inventive profanity, witticisms and even many moments of wisdom. Tarantino's primary gift, and the one he will be remembered for, is his gift for dialogue. You get the impression that actors are instructed to deliver their lines word-for-word; this isn't a film that feels improvised in any way. On some very odd occasions this can result in some lines feeling a little forced but the pay-off is massive, as the script is quite simply genius in many ways. This great writing has created some excellent iconic characters. It doesn't do any harm either that the acting is top level throughout. Well, with the exception of Tarantino's cameo that is &#x96; he's pretty terrible and should really never act. But otherwise its quality all the way with standout turns from Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Harvey Keitel, Christopher Walken and Uma Thurman. Jackson probably steals the show with the character Jules but Travolta is very impressive and convincing as Vincent Vega &#x96; you really believe he is a pretty nasty bit of work under the charm. Thurman and Willis play typical film-noir characters, namely the femme fatale and the boxer who throws the fight &#x96; both are excellent. While Keitel and Walken have cameo roles, with the former as the very memorable Mr Wolf, while the latter is in an extremely funny role as an ex-soldier who wore a watch up his butt.So what's it all about? Well the title says it all really because this is an unashamed bit of pulp fiction but a wonderfully original presentation of it. Its influence is other movies such as Italian poliziotteschi and American film noir, with a huge post-modernist make-over. Films specifically referenced include The Italian Connection (a black and white gangster hit men are sent to sort a situation out) and Kiss Me Deadly (a plot revolves around a suitcase that when opened has a mysterious glow). It is essentially a crime-comedy, with a real focus on humour. This means that some of the strong violence is played simultaneously realistically but also for comic effect. While the staggered time-line is constructed for maximum impact. It is, for example, a pretty rare thing for a film to kill off a character (Vincent) and then go back in time a little to watch his exploits in another escapade. We know he is doomed but can't help but completely forget this fact. It's one of many reasons that this film stands out. One of the very best of the 90's and Tarantino's masterpiece.

The chemistry between them seemed sizzling and genuine, and I liked how their relationship develops. I liked the film, had seen the modern version first, and am glad the original could stand up still to the latter one. This one's story was less sophisticated, and as such slightly less likely, and the main flaw for me was the HUGE initial leaps of assumption that Vicky (Dunaway) makes in her investigation given absolutely NO clues as to who the perpetrator of the robbery was. However, from that point, her investigation of Thomas Crown was exciting. The chess scene was excellently done, and must classier than the comparable black and white ball dance scene in the modern version which was a bit cheesy. Sexier too.The trouble with the 1968 version is that it's not aged well, and looks very dated. It is well filmed but has amateurish sound\/soundtrack and the split screen boxes don't really add a whole lot for the most part but perhaps they were cutting edge at the time. In a few scenes they do add to the action but only a few. I like that the ending leaves the viewer hanging, whereas in the 1999 version the end is more finished and played through and that does add something, I think. The film is a little improbable but enjoyable to watch and worth the time especially given the lead characters, although they weren't so well developed or rounded but given I'd seen the modern one, I could make comparisons and fill in some of the story. Whereas I prefer the actors in the early film, the latter one is a better film for the most part, and one I've seen a number of times.

Or, the evil looking taxi and its scenic routing-taking driver.Martin's tirade in the motel room against Candy is hilarious, yet at the same time quite hurtful- we both laugh at that scene and genuinely feel sorry for Candy's character.Another hilarious, infamous sequence has Martin's mild mannered businessman going bonkers, in a profanity-ridden tirade in a car rental agency (notice, even the agent working next to Edie McClurg during his meltdown starting at him) John Candy and Steve Martin have such impeccable timing and wonderful sense of delivery, that even lines of dialogue which are not necessarily funny are so well delivered as to make them funny (You broke the seat. You broke the goddamn seat! right before Candy obliviously drives down the wrong way on a highway) Candy miming and playing piano, jamming out and doing the Mess Around The rental car going up in flames, Wow! Ironically, if we listen carefully to the television news broadcast as Martin's wife is drifting off to sleep, we learn that the weather has cleared up, and flights are resuming as scheduled- meaning that if the two men had stayed at the airport, they could have caught their flight after a short delay!A hilariously funny movie that I never get tired of, no matter how many times I watch it.

The plot was written by John Hughes and was brought to life by Chris Columbus. It's the sequel to warm comedy Home Alone; Kevin McCallister is played by Macaulay Culkin and the criminals are played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, Catherine O'Hara, John Heard, Devin Ratray, Kieran Culkin also featured. It was filmed in 3 destinations Chicago Airport, New York and Miami. It was released on 15th November and was awarded the people's choice award for favourite comedy movie. Despite getting mixed reviews, the film became the second most successful film of 1992 (the most being Aladdin) earning over $173 million in revenue in America alone and over $358 worldwide! The McCallisters plan to spend Christmas in Miami, Kevin (the youngest) sees Florida as the worst place to spend it mostly due to the lack of Christmas trees. During Kevin's Christmas school play his older brother Buzz embarrasses him causing Kev to retaliate and ruin the play. Buzz apologises but Kevin refuses, storms to his bedroom and wishes he could go to his own holiday...not with his family, just like last year. On the eve of the vacation- Kevin's dad Peter- accidentally resets their alarm clock and causes the family to sleep in the next day. Meanwhile, Kevin's nemesis 'the Wet Bandits' (who now rename themselves 'the Sticky Bandits') escape from jail and are in New York. In confusion and rush to get to the airport on time, Kevin gets on a flight to New York and the rest of the family get on a flight to Miami without realising where their relation is until they land in Florida! Anyway, Kevin tours New York and uses his 'Talkboy' to check into the Plaza Hotel, afterwards he gets scared by a woman covered in pigeons in Central Park. On Christmas Eve, Kevin travels to Duncan's Toy Chest in a limo, there Kevin discovers the money made that day will go to the children's hospital and outside he runs into the Sticky Bandits then they chase him back to his hotel. Mr Hector, the hotel manager confronts him on his credit card, which came up as stolen, Kevin try's to run away but is then captured by his enemies. They talk about plans to rob Duncan's toy chest that night, afterwards Kevin escapes on the back of a horse and carriage. In Florida, the McCallisters find out their son is using Peter's credit card in New York, they then fly to find him. Having noted that his Uncle has a house in the city Kevin tries to visit him, he does find the house but the house is undergoing renovations while his Uncle is on holiday in Paris. Later in Central Park, Kev comes across the pigeon lady again, and when he gets his foot stuck in a rock she helps him instead of hurting him as he expected. He goes with the pigeon lady to her storage room flat above a music hall, whilst listening to music he learns how her life has fallen apart and how she deals with it by the seeking affection from pigeons in the park. Kevin vows to her that he'll be her friend. After leaving the flat, Kevin heads to his Uncle's house and sets booby traps inside, like he did with his own in the previous film, he then goes to the toy store during the Sticky Bandits raid. From there, all Hell breaks lose and I won't reveal any more. I love Christmas films but I have high standards for them, honestly I can't be bothered with Christmas light competitions or cringey reindeer stories. Home Alone is something different, the first film was a breath of fresh air, nobody had covered that story before and I think that's why people flocked to see it instead of the same old Rudolph story that was the appeal factor. I'm not sure how much appeal factor the sequel had though, there's only so many things you can do with a kid being at home by himself, but Home Alone 2 rings the best out of the dry towel that is the Home Alone franchise. On some levels it is repetitive, however it's still really good film and more specifically a really good Christmas film, in fact one of the best in my opinion. Plus, Macaulay Culkan jumped ship at the right moment because the rest of the Home Alone films were truly rubbish, (I think that's about the only thing Macaulay did right in his career other than doing the first 2 films.)

","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"1 February 2014","score":"","review":" It's very hard to beat Halloween in the slasher genre, but Candyman is one such film that has met, and quite possibly, is even went past the standards.Candyman is a story about a researcher named Helen who is doing a thesis on urban legends, and chooses to pursue the debunking of the Candyman, a near God-like figure to the residents of the slums, Cabrini Green in particular. Candyman was an African American from a rich family who fell in love with a white woman, and got her pregnant. This outraged white members of the town and killed him with bees, and cut off his hand, and jamming a hook into the stump. Now he haunts Cabrini Green, appearing whenever you say his name five times while looking in the mirror. Trying to prove Candyman doesn't exist, Helen gets more than she bargained for when she slowly realizes the myth is true, and starts to realize this murderous figure even loves her.The high point of this film is definitely in the chilling, haunting score by Phillip Glass, a spooky choir with a powerful tone that overwhelms you, and is especially fitting with the essence of Cabrini Green, and the slums in general.The acting is possibly one of the biggest points of this film too. This is especially rare in the slasher genre, since most of these kinds of films are made by new filmmakers, so it's common that you won't find a lot of talent. But here, the actors are convincing and not overplayed like screaming teenagers in other stereotypical slasher flicks.The direction is probably on par with the acting in this film, the way everything comes together is perfect. The music, the story, the visuals, the actors, everything fits perfectly here and the director did a very good job in making sure it all fit. This is definitely a must see for any fan of intelligent horror (as rare as it can be nowadays.) and will definitely please both the gore hounds and the art house fans alike. ","genre":null},{"date":"1 February 2014","score":"","review":" It's very hard to beat Halloween in the slasher genre, but Candyman is one such film that has met, and quite possibly, is even went past the standards.Candyman is a story about a researcher named Helen who is doing a thesis on urban legends, and chooses to pursue the debunking of the Candyman, a near God-like figure to the residents of the slums, Cabrini Green in particular. Candyman was an African American from a rich family who fell in love with a white woman, and got her pregnant. This outraged white members of the town and killed him with bees, and cut off his hand, and jamming a hook into the stump. Now he haunts Cabrini Green, appearing whenever you say his name five times while looking in the mirror. Trying to prove Candyman doesn't exist, Helen gets more than she bargained for when she slowly realizes the myth is true, and starts to realize this murderous figure even loves her.The high point of this film is definitely in the chilling, haunting score by Phillip Glass, a spooky choir with a powerful tone that overwhelms you, and is especially fitting with the essence of Cabrini Green, and the slums in general.The acting is possibly one of the biggest points of this film too. This is especially rare in the slasher genre, since most of these kinds of films are made by new filmmakers, so it's common that you won't find a lot of talent. But here, the actors are convincing and not overplayed like screaming teenagers in other stereotypical slasher flicks.The direction is probably on par with the acting in this film, the way everything comes together is perfect. The music, the story, the visuals, the actors, everything fits perfectly here and the director did a very good job in making sure it all fit.

","genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"1 February 2014","score":"","review":" I suppose this film has a reputation of being recognized as a sort of a classic in some views, to which respects I'm trying to explain my differing take emphasizing on why I only rank it a hair above average, at best. Although I find myself seeing this film only until now I have had the score over decade, as it was too, reputed. I wished a lot of things from this movie, yet it falls evenly short from its aim on a wide front. The story is to tell of the life and events centered on a family of men destined for great things and rich life. Yet the red line and meaning of all of this is missing and viewer is kept unmotivated and unengaged. There's nothing wrong with the performances of the cast, but there is also nothing great with them in ways it would raise the film to higher category on its own. The score is supposed to elevate the film and act as a coloring paint brush for the intermittently beautiful scenic photography and strong moments, yet it is thoroughly uncreative and uninspiring and I have always thought it is much overrated, as an attempt at sentimentality is not a redeeming quality on its own. In my opinion the relatively short ending moments are where the movie is at it's best.
