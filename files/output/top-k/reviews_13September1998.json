A Total Recall is what they don't want the main character to have, and a Total Recall is what comes to your mind when the end of the film arrives, and only then is when you understand what the script made you forget at the beginning.

I watched The Rainmaker just before watching  Good Will Hunting and I was blown away by the contrast of Damon's characters and the versatility of his acting.  First of all his southern drawl and Boston accent are wonderfully authentic.  This is important to the viewer who has to believe in the character.  Robin Williams would have been more believable if he'd have stuck with his own accent rather than attempting to muddle through one of the worst Baastan accents I've heard. It's distracting listening to him go in and out of it.  This is the only downer in an otherwise brilliant performance; his best serious role since  Awakenings, which was a far better performance. Far too little attention has been paid to Stellan Skarsgard's performance.  He is wonderful in his role as the domineering math professor attempting to take Will under his wing.  Skarsgard's dialogue with both Williams and Damon creates some of the more memorable scenes in the movie. Other great performances include Ben Affleck, Minnie Driver, and Casey Affleck. I'd like to include Cole Hauser as Bill in this list, but he barely has three lines in the whole movie.  Over all this film is entertaining, funny, and original. It's refreshing.

Why on earth was she cast for this role? I know  it's unfair to compare film & novel, but wouldn't it have been possible to  make her character just a LITTLE bit more downcast? Binoche is an actress  whose radiance just cannot be turned off it seems which make it look that  she's generally very happy with the situation she's in with just the odd  bit of feeling a little down (like when she finds out her boyfriend's been  shot to bits & when she sees Jan being blown to pieces). Not very  believable. Thank goodness Fiennes, Scott Thomas and Dafoe make up for it all with their  BRILLIANT performances for which they should all have received Oscars. I  still think Ralph and Krisitin would have won if they had been American  instead of British.Such beautiful colours, such moving music and a perfect script as well (with a STORY! Wow! VERY un-90s). Really, there's little wrong with this film, it's just a shame about Binoche.
