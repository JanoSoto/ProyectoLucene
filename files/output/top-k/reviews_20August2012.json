They went bigger for the sequel, to mixed results. I Still Know What You Did Last Summer feels like a different movie from its predecessor. Yes, someone is still trying to kill Julie James for what she and her friends did two summers ago. That hasn't changed. There are a few returning characters, but the new location of the killer's shenanigans (a near-deserted island in the Bahamas) and new cast (several of whom manage to be even more annoying than the first cast) give this movie a different tone. Different, but not necessarily better.It's harder to take the plot seriously this time around. Frequently, it's almost silly. The characters make willfully preposterous decisions, separate at every possible opportunity, and there's an easy to guess plot-turn near the end that requires way too much work to take credibly. That didn't ruin my enjoyment of what I was watching and I know that stuff is common in the genre, but it happens to such an excessive degree that it bears mentioning. There were some memorable scenes and kills, plus it was a bit cool to see Julie get fed up with being stalked and at least try to fight back. And there's nice pg-13 eye-candy if you're interested in that sort of thing, as Jennifer looks even better than the first time around and there's plenty of situations where she and Brandy are wet and half naked. Once you get acclimated to the faint ridiculousness of the whole thing, I Still Know What You Did Last Summer is about the same level of quality as the first. Less tense and more haphazard, but enjoyable. Easy-to-please slasher fans and people who just can't get enough of looking at Jennifer Love Hewitt (I fit into both of those categories) will probably find this worth at least checking out on your streaming service of choice, watching on cable, or picking up out of the $5 DVD bin.

So many remakes of beloved films draw complaints...and most of them are about how Hollywood screwed up what was a good story. In this film -- the only one of its kind, as far as I know -- Van Sant went for a literal remake...a shot-by-shot near-duplication of the original film.Oh, there are a few differences. Now that filmmaking is less puritanical, we actually get to see poor Marion Crane with stab wounds, as well as Norman Bates masturbating as he watches her shower. These do modernize the film for the present day without getting grotesque or exploitative. (The scenes are handled with relative restraint and do not come anywhere near approaching the explicitness of any number of other modern movies.)Still, bringing this film into the present day is a puzzling contradiction when much of the rest of the look of the film looks like it's set in the 1960s (opening graphics notwithstanding). Buildings look out-of-date. The dialog and camera movements seem quaint. Even the film's coloring looks like Kodak film stock from the 1960s.Which is not a criticism, just a note that all this doesn't juxtapose well with the aforementioned shower and masturbating scenes...not to mention declaring outright that the movie takes place in 1998.And of course one can argue with the casting -- that Anne Heche is no Janet Leigh, and that Vince Vaughn is certainly no match for Anthony Perkins. Heche is a puzzling choice. She may just have been coming out of the closet when this film was released; nevertheless she now seems an odd choice for the part of a woman carrying out a torrid love affair with a man in seedy hotels. Even her waif-like hair and figure only serve to enhance her contrast with the voluptuous, more traditionally beautiful Janet Leigh.And Vince Vaughn loses on two counts. First, he's not particularly good in this. Perhaps no one could have adequately followed the boyish, delicate, twitchy Perkins, but Vaughn does little if anything to make this role his own. And second -- and this is certainly no fault of the director -- the kind of roles Vaughn has chosen to take since this one have pretty much eradicated any chance that viewers will take him seriously in this role.For all its problems, however, this film does answer the question, What if somebody tried to make a remake, a shot-for-shot remake, of a classic film, only in color and with a little judicious updating?

Marty & Bobby grew up together & were supposed best friends, but Bobby was a HUGE bully & bullied Marty terribly for years. I watched both the movie & the documentary, as well as reading the book. This movie is a raw, in your face look at the epidemic of bullying & what could happen when this bullying goes too far. I'm not condoning what these kids did by any means, but I found it ironic that Bobby's family thought their son was too good for Marty, when in reality, it was THEIR son who was the problem. I was disgusted when, in the documentary, Lisa acts like she was so scared (even going so far as to keep her face shadowed), when SHE was the catalyst behind this entire plot to kill Bobby. Not only was she the one who brought up the solution of killing Bobby to Marty, but also was the only one who knew Derek the self-proclaimed gang member (he was so NOT one & even his little brothers laughed at that). After the murder, Lisa bragged to anyone who would listen about what MARTY did, never once putting any of the blame on herself. She even dragged her naive cousin, Derek, who really wanted nothing to do with this whole thing, (he was content playing video games & told Lisa he didn't want any part of it). Ironically, Derek (cousin) was pretty much bullied himself into participating. In the documentary, Allie makes herself out to be a whole lot more innocent than she really was. She was was a spoiled girl with a new Mustang, a baby that her parents took care of & would be considered loose as far as boys & sex was concerned. She had no problem going to Marty's house & taking Bobby right into the bedroom the first time she ever met him. Heather was the sad, train wreck of the group. She had a miserable life in a violent family. Donnie was nothing more than a hanger-on who was pretty much up for anything & very much a follower, as well as completely under Allie's sex spell. Derek, (wannabe gangster), portrayed himself as a thug, so when these kids came to him for help with their scheme, he had to take the role as leader. If he didn't, he would be exposed & everyone would see him for the nobody he really was instead of a gangster. As much as I would like to, I can't feel very much sympathy for Bobby Kent. True, nobody should die like that, but in addition to his appalling every day treatment of Marty, he degraded females, calling them the b word & w word (no profanity can be used in a review) & used them for rough sex even if they didn't want to. Bobby had no problem humiliating Marty in public & in private, both verbally & physically. Notice that Bobby was much bigger & stronger than the slightly built Marty. Would this have happened without the coercing of Lisa? Maybe. Marty had never stuck up for himself throughout his entire life when it came to Bobby Kent, so I doubt that he ever would have. After Lisa relentlessly keeps the pressure on Marty that the only way to get rid of Bobby & his bullying is to kill him, I think Marty (in extremely bad judgment) most likely felt that this would be the only way to ever get rid of Bobby. I thought it was really sad how Bobby humiliates Marty in front of people, beats him up on a regular basis & makes Marty's life a living hell. And Bobby is supposed to be Marty's best friend since childhood? The bottom line of this whole story is that NOBODY won, not to mention the fact that it was 6 on 1. With those odds, the outcome for Bobby wasn't very good. Marty got rid of Bobby, but now he's in prison & probably getting bullied by people far worse than Bobby Kent. Lisa Connelly has she & Marty's baby in prison, Allie's child has no mother, Heather has just continued her family history of violence, Derek (cousin) was a pretty good kid who got caught up in his cousin's scheme & wasted what life he may have had. Donnie (the person people knew the least about), is in the same boat as the others & Derek, the fake gangbanger, is finding himself in the gang world of prison & he sure won't fit in. All the actors\/actresses in this movie did an excellent job. Nick Stahl was amazing in his portrayal of Bobby Kent. Like I said, I'm trying to find some sympathy for Bobby, but it's hard. I was bullied all through school from Kindergarten through high school to the point where I dropped out of school & got my GED. The ramifications of this bullying is still with me years later. Killing a bully is obviously not the answer, but what is? It seems like today, kids don't listen to their parents, teachers or anyone who's tries to tell them they're not going in the right direction. To those that are bullied, it's hard to realize that school won't last forever & that they WILL survive, but it's easier said than done. Both murder & suicide are permanent solutions to temporary problems. People need to speak up & stand up when bullying going on, but it's not always out in the open. A lot of the bullying that Bobby did to Marty was in private & from the details of this case, neither set of parents knew what was going on between the two. The bottom line is that situations like this, as well as school shootings, etc., will continue. There are no easy answers, but the fact that it's out in the open finally is a step in the right direction.

All the actors\/actresses in this movie did an excellent job. Nick Stahl was amazing in his portrayal of Bobby Kent. Like I said, I'm trying to find some sympathy for Bobby, but it's hard. I was bullied all through school from Kindergarten through high school to the point where I dropped out of school & got my GED. The ramifications of this bullying is still with me years later. Killing a bully is obviously not the answer, but what is? It seems like today, kids don't listen to their parents, teachers or anyone who's tries to tell them they're not going in the right direction. To those that are bullied, it's hard to realize that school won't last forever & that they WILL survive, but it's easier said than done. Both murder & suicide are permanent solutions to temporary problems. People need to speak up & stand up when bullying going on, but it's not always out in the open. A lot of the bullying that Bobby did to Marty was in private & from the details of this case, neither set of parents knew what was going on between the two. The bottom line is that situations like this, as well as school shootings, etc., will continue. There are no easy answers, but the fact that it's out in the open finally is a step in the right direction.

If scenes from the movie still turn up in your head on a daily basis weeks afterward, and these make you ask new questions each time, I think it may very well belong in that rare category. To me, François Truffaut's L'Infant SAUVAGE (THE WILD CHILD) has provided such an experience. The story is set in the late 1700s, covering the story of one Dr. Itard who is trying to raise and educate a child (eventually named Victor) who is thought to have been living with wild animals for his entire life.The film may appear to be be quite conventionally assembled, relying as it does on a narrator's voice throughout and following a strictly accessible structure. However, Traffaut's alert use of camera-angles, as well as the beautiful cinematography, often contributes considerably to certain points made in the story, though one may not even realize this at first. For instance, in one of the scenes depicting Dr. Itard's attempts at learning some of the obligatory knowledge of civilized society to Victor, we are positioned from the outside of Itard's house, granted a viewpoint through an open (but still distancing) window. It is a simple effect, but makes us quietly conscious of the fact that we, like Itard, are observing another person's state of mind (that of the wild child) which we can never expect to understand, and for that reason should probably be resistant of forcing upon our own world-view.Of at least equal merit as the direction are the performances; Traffaut himself is very convincing as the firm but, it must be assumed, not ill-intentioned Itard, while young Jean-Pierre Cargol strikes me as so unbelievably believable as Victor that it is aching to witness at times. Though superficially most viewers probably identify themselves with Itard's point of view, I believe anyone who's been a child would find it hard not to somehow connect the confusion Victor seems to suffer with some instance of confusion oneself may have experienced in childhood, no matter how mild that case of confusion may appear compared to what Victor goes through. At the same time, it is worth noting that it is not, necessarily, Victor who is most puzzled; Dr. Itard seems equally bewildered as to how to cope with Victor's state of mind, as the other way around. Victor's understanding of the world is not necessarily wrong; certainly not from his own point of view.Though generally said to be based on truth, it has been noted that THE WILD CHILD does not quite follow the story as written down by the actual Itard. For one thing, Itard was in fact still a student when he took it upon him to take care of Victor, and not an educated physician, and it has in later years been heavily doubted if Victor actually was brought up by wolves (wolves taking care of another species seems very improbable in itself, and even if it did occur, Victor would hardly have survived ten years in the woods under such circumstances; furthermore, Victor reportedly wore some clothing when found, if only barely). However, more interesting than how much of what we see presented here is indisputable truth, I think, is how the film raises its questions and dilemmas. Itard needed to be portrayed as an educated physician for the sake of symbolic effect, and whether or not Victor was raised by wild animals, it still remains a fact that he understood the world vastly different than most human beings, and was discovered at a time when it was not considered an inevitable alternative to give him a diagnosis (a strong case of autism has later been suggested).Was it right to bring Victor into the civilized world, though one assumed him to have lived by the laws of the animal kingdom for most of his life? Granted, this question is perhaps not so interesting to discuss from an ethical standpoint. After all, any reasonably empathic human being who found a naked, seemingly abandoned child in the dark woods would instantly conclude that s\/he should be brought to authorities of the civilized world to be taken care of, irrelevant of whether such an act would deprive the child of the existence which s\/he had come to view as normal due to his\/her unusual circumstances. However, one question worthy of discussion, perhaps, is whether the intentions behind the attempts of civilizing Victor were sufficiently justifiable?At the time Victor was found, in the late 18th century, still during the era of the French revolution, parts of France suffered from poverty and uncertain prospects, with families starving on the streets in the larger cities; these were merely unfortunate ones. At the same time, Victor from the woods was granted entrance into upper middle-class existence and its comforts, and on what condition? That he could prove a valuable vessel to scientific experiments? If so, the gradual development of Victor's emotional life is particularly tragic, because though he learns to cry, he is not able to handle emotions that reach beyond his natural instincts from a rational perspective. If it was right to force civilization upon Victor, it was arguably done on the wrong basis.Anyhow, these are just some of the questions I found myself asking. You may also watch the film for its fine performances and cinematography; THE WILD CHILD can be enjoyed on several levels.

It does not get boring! The great thing about Mrs.Doubtfire is the fine balance between comedy and story. There's a great human story which is what makes the comedy work so tremendously well. The characters are fleshed out so that we're all rooting for Daniel Hillard and desperately hoping that he doesn't ever get found out. It's the story about the rise of a man, who only wants to see his children, but goes about it in a very extreme and hilarious way.The screenplay is absolute genius. It's one hilarious gaga after another and on top of that you've got Robin Williams looking like a 60 year old woman delivering the lines! You only have to look at him and burst into laughter (I do). Robin Williams is absolutely perfect in the role and the moment where he gives the hard-faced Mrs.Selner a preview of all his talented voices perfectly demonstrates why he's the best man for the role.There are countless classic, funny moments throughout Mrs.Doubtfire that makes it two hour running time go in a breeze. The finale is also a comedy tour-de-force with Daniel having to battle his two identities whilst getting very drunk. The introduction of Pierce Brosnon's character, Stu is also genius. It's hilarious to see Mrs.Doubtfire getting jealous of his, especially at the pool.

Few films work so well on repeat viewings, especially in the action genre.Starting with the slight negatives, the plot has some points that could have been better. The McGuffin brand case works fine but it's a little simpleminded, especially given the sophistication of the rest of the film. And there are some questionable plot points, a few instances of 'why doesn't he just...'. But these things happen in the best of thrillers, and this one has a level of complexity that requires a bit of focus the first couple of times you watch it, so these things happen. After you've seen it more than twice, you can start to notice the excellent detailing, and everything makes much better sense.DeNiro gives a wonderful performance, exactly as intense as necessary to be convincing without going overboard. He and Jean Reno have great chemistry as actors, playing two men who find themselves being able to trust each other in an untrustworthy situation, and it only occasionally steps into cliché territory. Stellan Skarsgaard is fantastic as usual. Natasha McElhone speaks with a not-too-great Irish brogue, but putting that aside, her look and attitude give a much more adult sensuality to her character than most action movie females put on. Great performances.Really, the film is meant for action lovers who are over the age of twenty-one, and that's a revelation in itself. Ronin has a stylishness born of an atmosphere that's both cool - love the soundtrack - and gritty, preferring a portrayal of international intrigue that cuts the perfect balance between entertaining and realistic enough to spark the imagination. The bullet removal scene is just excellent, and will draw squirms from some viewers. If there's any place where the film goes overboard, it's the car chases, but good sweet baby Jesus, it's the best kind of overboard.

Even when playing with rocket launchers and taking the Citroen off-road and massively exaggerating the destructive effects of 40mm M203 grenades, you just let the movie have those things and enjoy every screaming second of it.

De Niro and Penn were cast right . It was the way they played their characters that was out of character for them! They both underplayed their roles as dim-witted convicts and to me , that hurt the picture immensely. I'm so use to seeing them completely annihilate a role with their raw intensity that seeing them barely acting or acting not in their norm, just ruined it for me.Still it was great to see these two legends act together. Demi Moore as Molly was a little better. As a tough single-mom trying to make a living for her and her deaf-mute child. She over acted but it was okay. She was a little more believable than De Niro in their scenes. Had De Niro acted like he should have, he would have blown away Moore in their scenes. Another thing that for me didn't ring through was Moore's and De Niro's so-called chemistry. There wasn't any! No sparks, no nothing! A big yawn! So the ending does not ring through at all for me.Hoyt Axton as Father Levesque was great casting. He looked the part and his scenes rang true with me. The late Bruno Kirby as a guilt-ridden deputy was a little amusing. Again I found it hard to believe he and Demi were getting it on It was more amusing to me to see Kirby and De Niro in the same scene and envisioned them from way back in The GodfatherPart 2(1974) as Young Corleone and young Clemenza.The late Ray McNally, who by the way this film is dedicated to in memory, did a great small role as the warden. He was intense and no BS in his pursuit of the escaped cons. James Russo as 'Bobby' the main bad-guy convict was brilliant. He oozed evil personified. Reminded me of James Remar's Ganz from 48Hrs (1982) Yes he over acted but it was necessary since both De Niro & Penn were so underplaying it.And last but least, Wallace Shawn as the translator and John C. Reilly as the young monk entranced and impressed with Penn's 'Father Brown', were excellent. So all in all these bit character actors made the film better than the main stars! What a shame because had Sean and Robert act the way they naturally do, they would have blown away everyone and stolen the picture. Oh well...there is always the original with Bogart,Ray and Ustinov.

De Niro and Penn were cast right . It was the way they played their characters that was out of character for them! They both underplayed their roles as dim-witted convicts and to me , that hurt the picture immensely.

The film's ultimate goal is one I can recognize; showcasing rather two-dimensional characters in a plot surrounding an enormous storm that engulfed the east coast and created millions of dollars in restitution payments and to showcase the storm itself. It succeeds in both. This is nowhere near a fleshed-out film, but it isn't a ho-hum Michael Bay extravaganza, where faint archetypes take the stage instead of compelling characters. This is a rare occurrence where even though we do not know a whole lot about these characters, we come to sympathize with them in the final act for reasons we can not totally explain. Perhaps their personalities, or maybe their innocence, has grabbed onto us.The film focuses on the storm of October 1991, where a nor'easter was absorbed by Hurricane Grace to create one of the most violent and unforgiving storms in history. We center around a swordfishing team who drive a boat named the Andrea Gail in Gloucester, Massachusetts. Captained by Billy Tyne (George Clooney) and made up of members Bobby Shatford (Mark Wahlberg), Dale Murphy (John C. Reilly), David Sullivan (William Fichtner), Alfred Pierre (Allen Payne), and Bugsy Moran (John Hawkes), the boat has continuously brought in a miniscule amount of fish, resulting in very low pay among the crewmembers.They sail out past their usual turf, with an unmaintainable, unpredictable storm is brewing in the back of them. When they decide to travel all the way to Flemish Cap, an even further location, they wind up catching, literally, a boatload of fish, but with a broken ice-machine, they must hurry back before the catch spoils. Waiting would result in a wasted trip, so by the crew's unanimous agreement, they push on through the treacherous waters, fifty foot waves, unforgivable currents, and constant rainfall to bring the town of Gloucester their catch.Astraphobics and Lilapsophobics be forewarned; this film is relentless in its depiction of brutal weather. Shots of currents consuming the Andrea Gail are not uncommon, nor are underwater sequences which are expertly directed and choreographed. Petersen never seems to lose control of this monumental picture, despite filming it on such a large grid. His direction never once becomes sterile or anemic, and it seems that with Das Boot, The Perfect Storm, and the recent Poseidon remake under his belt, he has a more confident feeling underwater than on the surface.When The Perfect Storm deals with the troubles on surface it does not try to undermine them. It shows contentions crewmates had with each other, the restlessness of going out against better judgment, and the idea of the possible loss of loved ones. Writers Bo Goldman and William D. Wittliff unfortunately tuck deeper characteristics away, but a deep character study shouldn't be expected when we have a film centered around a colossal disaster. We get solid, fleshed-out characters and that is enough.The true shine is watching elaborate shots of remarkable special effects take center stage to create a grimly realistic setting of the ocean at its worst. The scene which has been used as the film's main theatrical poster is truly a sight to behold. It's remarkable how scene after scene of The Perfect Storm isn't taken with incredulity or a bent reality. It isn't as narrow-minded or as hackneyed as its premise would expect. It isn't typical Hollywood-driven disaster schlock. It's quick, evocative, and effectively entertaining.Starring George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Diane Lane, John C.

Yes. In the 30s, Clark Gable as Fletcher Christian, mutineer, was stern but a humanitarian, whereas Charles Laughton as Captain Bligh of HMS Bounty was a sadistic beast, scowling and flogging a man even after he was dead from flogging.The splashy 1960s version had Trevor Howard as Bligh, not necessarily mean by nature but obsessed by the need for discipline and a compulsion to complete the mission even at the expense of his crew. Marlon Brando, beginning as a somewhat comic figure, held his temper until driven to take the ship. He dies horribly.There ought to be hardly any interpretations left, short of turning this into a CGI-propelled Clash of the Titans. But here we are with Anthony Hopkins as Bligh, a friend of Mel Gibson as Christian. And Bligh is a genuinely NICE GUY -- until Freud rears his bearded head and he begins to envy Gibson's easy self indulgence and punishes him as well as the crew. Hopkins gets to sweat a lot. He tosses in bed, thinking of Gibson ashore, boffing that pretty Tahitian maiden.Hopkins also sheds his usual restraint and shouts and grins ironically, insanely. Gibson, on the other hand, is breathless and wide eyed and uncertain. They are supported by an impressive cast -- Daniel Day-Lewis as a bitchy heavy, Liam Neeson who doesn't care if he gets hanged, Olivier and Fox as part of Bligh's court martial.Except for the scenes dealing with Pitcairn Island, the story is told from Hopkins' point of view as he narrates the events at his trial. Of the actors -- the Pacific Islanders aside -- Gibson's performance seems the least convincing, although he's young and handsome.There is a strange electronic score underlying the events. Sometimes, as when a storm is approaching, it's ominous. Most of the time it's more distracting than anything else.The previous tales of the Bounty were, in their different ways, engaging, and this one may be less compelling but it still has some novel features.

William Holden is a correspondent who falls for a half-Chinese doctor (Jennifer Jones) and many things seem to be conspiring against their love.Love is a Many-Splendored Thing is a lovely film. It's very glossy, colorful, filled with tremendous locations and a nice theme song. However, it also is filled with very sappy dialog, characters who are difficult to really like and that #^$@ theme song, as they play it INCESSANTLY!!! It not only wells up when the two lovers are in a clinch, but when they turn on the record player and, well, ALL THE TIME! While pretty, it becomes pretty insufferable after a while. It's really a shame, as Jennifer Jones and William Holden are nice actors--but the film really could have used a re-write. While some reviewers loved the romance, I couldn't get over the fact that Holden's character was already married--making him an adulterer. For me, adultery isn't romantic--it's just kind of sleazy. This, combined with the sappy dialog (some of which made no sense at all) and the theme song made this a chore--a very pretty chore, but a chore nevertheless. And don't even get me started on the casting of Jones as a half-Chinese lady (who mentions it every 35 seconds--as if trying VERY hard to convince us of something that is really hard to swallow). Not wonderful...but pretty.By the way, if you are wondering about the dialog that makes no sense at all, here's an example When Holden is away covering the Korean War, Jones comments how 'it feels like he's more with me now than when he's really here with me' as she reads his letter to her.

I recently revisited the film on DVD and was surprised to discover that it's actually an excellent little action\/mystery\/thriller and one of my all-time favourites.The ever under-appreciated Kurt Russell stars as that classic archetype, the ordinary guy, who finds himself out of his depth when his wife goes missing after hitching a ride with a seemingly kindly trucker.

Truly, you could hear a pin drop as I sat watching this film, riveted to the screen; the bank scene is the real highlight, but the later antics pay off nicely too. Things culminate with a nicely directed action scene featuring some great car stunts.Much of the film's success comes from the casting of Russell, whose acting adds immeasurably to the experience. He's one of those instantly identifiable and likable actors who you end up rooting for from the outset, even in more conflicted roles like the one he played in corrupt cop yarn DARK BLUE.

Allen doesn't feel at home with his role at all, more than ever playing not a character but himself stuck with a gig as an insurance investigator; it's impossible to buy him as the hard-boiled womanizer. Worse is his on-screen chemistry with Helen Hunt - there is none. We as viewers know there's sexual tension between them only because, in films, there always is between co-workers of opposite sexes who hate each other - but none of it shows up in their performances. There's also no chemistry between Hunt and Dan Aykroyd, whose character is a completely flat waste.The film is not all bad, of course, it's Woody Allen and therefore has entertainment value.

I found my self bored trying to stop my eyes from dancing about. As a student film I would said good effort. But please film makers do not go down this route as Blair witch it not clever.
