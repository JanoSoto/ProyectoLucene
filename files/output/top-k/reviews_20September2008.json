He is introduced to the viewer as an adventurous young boy who relishes at the chance of having a close friendship, even while at the cost of driving his hardworking mother bonkers (like when he chooses to befriend a squirrel).His main objective is to satisfy his need for friendship. The inciting incident that leads him on this journey is when his television short circuits and interrupts his horror film. Committed to find the fiend who stole, or should we say, ate his antenna wire, Hogarth plunges into the forest and discovers the iron giant. When he makes the conscious choice to save the robots life after seeing him entangled in a web of electrical power lines, it is here, whether he realizes it or not, that his once balanced life becomes unbalanced. After all, to befriend the giant is to introduce a heavy weight, both physically and metaphorically, into his life; thus tipping the balancing scale. Hogarth, however, is up for the challenge. His thirst for friendship surpasses the weight of any obstacle that might thwart this desire of his. Soon the giant begins to follow him where ever he goes. Hogarth is now faced with an enormous obstacle&#151;to hide the giant while protecting him from a paranoid government detective. One obstacle after the next, a special bond is created between Hogarth and the giant; one that truly exemplifies the meaning of the word 'friendship.' With Hogarth's continual choice to befriend the giant, the plot is further developed and the audience learns that the giant is much like Hogarth himself&#151;one who has a soul that feels and thinks. This significant plot point may have never been revealed unless there was a character like Hogarth who extended an unprejudiced love towards the giant&#151;a love that seemed to lack in the rest of the city because of their fear of 'otherness.' The audience also learns that the giant is a volitional being who can choose whether to be good like superman, or bad like Atomo. This is revealed, once again, because of Hogarth. With Hogarth's help, the giant learns not to act like a weapon of destruction, but rather as a friend to mankind. This idea is particularly emphasized at the crisis\/climax of the film. As Hogarth had originally sacrificed the safety of his life when saving the giant, the giant now returns the favor at the end of the film by sacrificing his life to save both Hogarth and the rest of the city. This you could say is the film's meatball criticism one who lays down his life for the life of his friend is truly a friend indeed. True friendship is found in sacrifice, not selfishness, be it ever great or small. Is Hogarth's objective obtained? I would say yes, for it is the robot's memory that will forever live in his mind as the best friend he ever had.

Sylvester Stallone stars as John Rambo, a man who has returned from the Vietnam war. In his past lie the horrors of the war. The long days when he was tortured by his captors and his body bears the scars of all that was done to him. He comes home to find that he has no friends left. And all of a sudden he finds himself in the hands of a cop who provokes all the war that lay deep inside him. And then, having been trained to kill and destroy all that came as a threat, Rambo wages a war as a one-man army on the whole police force. One of things I admire about Stallone's physique is that he looks like a soldier toughened up and built up because of his experience as a soldier. His muscles don't look like they have been subjected to artistic and systematic development. This gives him a tough look like that of a man who fought the toughest of battles in his entire life and the body came as a side product of it all. He does not fail to convince you that he indeed is a Green Beret who has done and seen it all. Like all action movies, Stallone's character does things that are humanly impossible. He jumps off cliffs and wages war on the whole city. While that does impress you as to what a war can do to the psyche of a man it still leaves you wondering how a man can do all this. But it does not matter. Action movies are meant to show things to you that do not happen in the real life and can happen in the reel life alone. These exaggerations can be easily forgiven. All in all, Stallone manages to deliver all the goods that are essential for an action movie - a bike chase, plenty of guns, strategical attacks and a lot of fireworks. But there is an emotional element to the movie as well. At the end of the movie, Rambo gets a chance to talk to his superior back in the war operations, the only person whom he can look upon as a friend and a guide. He breaks down and explains to him all that he has been through and how he has been left with nothing, how his life has completely been changed by the war and all the years spent fighting and getting tortured , living in a place where he witnessed the dark face of the human race. A highly recommended movie from my side. One of the best action movies of all times.

Moving, tear-jerking and simply brilliant.(This is a review of the 2002 re-restored edition) Come on, admit it! It gets you every time. I would. You know what I am talking about, those scenes that still bring a small tear into our eyes and a cheer to our hearts. Whether it's the scene where E.T., who got sick, is desperately being cured by a couple of scientists who only want him alive for the (non-dying) sake of science, while the boy who becomes his friend only wants him alive because of their friendship. Or what about that scene near the end, the scene where little E.T., finally found his way back to his spaceship. As the lights flood from the doorway and the doors almost close, as E.T.'s earth-bound friends go teary-eyed, a dog walks into the ship's door, desperately wanting to go but can't. This, and perhaps many other scenes, is what makes E.T. the classic that it is. Re-released in a new restored version, it only makes E.T. more a classic that it is. The film adds many great things to the already great piece, but thankfully doesn't take anything else, at least not those that made it good.Being born in the 90's, the restored version of E.T. is the only way I this classic met my eyes back when I was a kid, even until now. But this new version is still quite the film critics and public alike described. Maybe because the film's restorations, unlike the restorations George Lucas did to his STAR WARS trilogy, the 'changes' done here weren't major. Things like adding a new CGI E.T. in a few scenes were Carlo Rambaldi's puppet didn't look pretty convincing or digitally removing guns since Steven Spielberg felt it to be too intense for his vision are very small alterations to a brilliant film. Other than that, the sound and picture quality is cleaned-up for good measure, making it as good-as-new. In that way, it does the film some justice and at the same time, giving it a little makeover.But in the end, it's the story that still wins us over in this, or any other version. The power of E.T.'s adventure on earth with his friend Elliot (Henry Thomas) and his gang (not to mention Drew Barrymore's familiar performance as Elliot's charming sister Gertie). When the film was released at the Cannes Film Festival back then, it received a standing ovation. Or in simple screenings in the theater alone, E.T. has the power to grab our hearts and mellow it until our eyes shed a tear. Be it joy or sympathy, this is a movie with big emotions. We care about the characters and what happens to them. Is it no wonder those scenes in this film still has the power to grab the audience and let them go with tears and cheers. E.T. is still one of the finest piece of family entertainment, perhaps one of the best films ever made. Okay, that maybe an overstatement, but could you disagree? Rating ***** out of 5.

And yet unlike many other science-fiction films it anticipates present day reality in eerie jarring ways.

It's a world where happiness and enjoyment is available to the rich for whom happiness and enjoyment is defined in successions of permanent appointments with plastic surgeons, eating bad food in bad restaurants and wearing horrible clothes and horrible jewels and where for the ones without privilege is one of frustration, disappointment, small pleasures and celebrations and persecution from their own governments and where everyone else is open season from terrorists save for eccentric misfits who may or may not be terrorists. In essence a world where those who laugh last haven't heard the bad news. Not very different from the real world.The film's satire is filled with an anarchic sensibility in that it never goes after one particular person. There is no villain to the film. The main plot device(the MacGuffin) happens for absolutely no reason when a guy tries to swat a fly and the bug gets trapped in an automatic typrewriting machine which changes one alphabet in one of it's many copies. This one change of alphabet destroys one family, results in the death of an innocent man and yet the system continues nonetheless afraid to acknowledge it's error and in effect it's fallibility and in order to protect it's system it goes to even more ridiculous lengths. The world of Brazil is insane only because the system pretends to be rational and logical when it is not. Where the paperwork of a bureaucracy instead of regulating action only causes further chaos.Jonathan Pryce's excellent performance as Sam allows the audience to see both a likable romantic dreamer and also a bureaucrat who likes his system enough as long as he can use it.

Michael Palin's Jack Lint is a model of the banality of evil and would have done well in Nazi Germany while Ian Holm's comparatively minor level bureaucrat reveals one who is not inherently malicious but likes to get his job done as swathed as he is in paperwork.The film's main thrust is it's sense of dream and fantasy and how it relates to everyday reality.

And what they always say is a thrill to listen to even though they don't contribute anything to the story.Also, the movie's unusual structure is another high point, it isn't as straight-forward as the other movies are which is why they're boring to watch because you find out what everything is about almost right away.

Of course, consensus has little to do with real world excellence or failure, but as good an example of this trend as can be shown certainly is John Ford's famed 1956 John Wayne Western, The Searchers. Upon its initial release, the film made a solid profit, and was considered a good film. By the late 1960s and early 1970s, however, film school graduates started championing both it and Ford as more than good, but great. By the 1980s, with the rise of PC, the film's political content and its portrayal of Manifest Destiny came under attack as 'racist,' and the film was not held in as high regard for some years. With the advent of DVD technology, in the late 1990s, the film was re-released, and its current status as a 'masterpiece' has been little challenged since. Indeed, in watching the special features on the two disk Ultimate Collector's Edition DVD of the film, one might believe that the film is Shakespearean. Assorted talking heads and film buffs gush over the film; even people like director Martin Scorsese. Another great director, Akira Kurosawa, is cited as declaring he learned film technique from watching John Ford Westerns.Of course, I do not doubt all of these people's love for the film, but love (or like\/hate) is a wholly different paradigm from artistic excellence. And while there is no doubt that, technically, John Ford was a superb craftsman- in the framing of shots, in the use of silences that he carried over from his silent film days, in the judicious use of close-ups, and the brilliant use of color in this VistaVision film, it is nowhere near a great work of art. Technique and technical excellence do not equate with greatness. Were that true a poet with a merely flawless ear, like Walter de la Mare, would be ranked along with the Whitmans and Baudelaires. No, there needs to be characterization and great acting. This is where screen writing and casting come in. The film's actual screenplay is simplistic, larded with stereotypes, and the acting- save for a few scenes where Jeffrey Hunter (as mixed breed Martin Pawley) shines, is self-conscious, poseur, and given that the film is as triumphalist as can be, it makes such preening seem hedonistic.Naturally, the worst sinner, on this accord, is John Wayne, as the film's putative hero\/anti-hero, Ethan Edwards. There is no doubt Wayne had a great on screen presence- both physically and in his idiosyncratic emoting and speaking styles; but while watching the film, and seeing him strut and spit out trite lines while dickwaving through every second he's on camera, I fully understand why someone like my dad- a left of center trade unionist, found both the man and the characters he played (which were really minor variations on his own faux persona, admixed with testosterone) to be symbols of everything that's wrong with America, past and present.At first, The Searchers was an undervalued film; now it's a grossly overrated one. The truth lies somewhere between the extremes- something men like John Wayne nor Ethan Edwards ever seemed to learn, no matter how many things critics want to read into a shrug, an akimbo stance, nor an oddly breathily paused cliché uttered.

The movie is, as I suggested, ironic&#151;yet _unconclusively so. It is unassuming, sometimes funny, and Mel Gorham is very sexy.

Rarely has there been a greater and more vivid example of this reality than in comparing the two films Swedish filmmaker Ingmar Bergman released in 1957 The Seventh Seal and Wild Strawberries.The first film, which is the subject of this essay, is stark, cosmic, spare, allegorical, and unremitting in its view of life, whereas Wild Strawberries is rich, personal, realistic (even if it uses symbolism), and open to several viable interpretations. Both films starred many of Bergman's 'stock actors from the 1950s Max Von Sydow as Knight Antonius Block, Bibi Andersson as Mia, the wife of Jof the jester (and utterly gorgeous, as opposed to mere cuteness in Wild Strawberries), and Gunnar Björnstrand as Block's squire Jöns, a pragmatic Sancho Panza to Block's spiritual Don Quixote. While Björnstrand is nominally the third lead in the film, behind Sydow and Bengt Ekerot as the personification of Death, in truth he is the dominant lead character, with by far the most, and the best, lines of dialogue. And while this film is an allegory loaded with symbolism, it is also a very simple story of a middle 14th Century knight's return to Sweden from the Crusades of the Middle Ages&#133;. The acting is uniformly excellent. Sydow is utterly transparent as Block. We see every cranny of doubt and belief written on his face. Poppe, as Jof, shows what Roberto Benigni might be like, if he had a dram of depth, Ekerot's Death is frightening only in his pomp and banality, but Björnstrand gives a truly great performance in the most difficult of the roles- treading between comedy and drama, realism and absurdism, as the squire who seems to be the wisest of all the characters. While this film was made at the height of the early Cold War, and many early reviewers took the Plague as an allegory for nuclear war, the film is far more than a simplistic political screed. At 96 minutes it also is not tool long that it batters the viewer with its message, nor too short that it slips quickly by. This film proves why black and white is still a vital tool in film-making. Had it been shot in color its dreamy quality would be rent, for shadows and depth are far easier to portray in black and white, and are far more suggestive of moodiness and inner turmoil. One problem is that the DVD version of the film I have, from The Criterion Collection, errs in allowing the black and white English words to be used, rather than colorizing them for clearer and speedier reading, thus detracting from the visual cornucopia on screen. This is why watching the film, a second time, with or without comments, is recommended, for many visual subtleties are revealed that are lost in a first viewing's necessity to read the dialogueAll in all, it's little wonder why speed-addicted, and Lowest Common Denominator afflicted American viewers have never taken to films like this, of such high quality.

Conversely, if we dislike someone, each of those flaws and quirks is held against them, often with a vengeance. Something similar happens with films. We like to think that our judgment is rational and that we judge a film, how 'good' or 'bad' it is depending on how we evaluate its constituent parts. So we might ponderously proclaim that 'despite a good script, this film was let down by its direction'; of we might say 'the director worked wonders with unpromising material and a poor script'. But finally - and despite our conceit that we are trying to be fair and objective - we find that we liked or disliked a film despite itself. For me Under Suspicion is a film I found I liked. After watching it (on DVD), I called up the IMDb pages to read what others thought of it, and, as usual, I paid rather more attention to those who 'hated it' than to the many who are apt to go over the top. Criticisms made by other members included that Puerto Rico is a Spanish-speaking island but that neither Morgan Freeman nor Gene Hackman could speak any Spanish. Then there us one gripe that this must previously have been a theatre piece because all the action takes place in one room (it doesn't really, in fact, but then that is neither here nor there). These viewers obviously belong in the camp of those who couldn't warm to the film and who pick up on each and every flaw and quirk. I, on the other hand was rather taken with it. Granted, within minutes of the film ending a number of objections came to mind - flaws - but then I didn't care I had just enjoyed a thrilling piece full of suspense with two riveting performances from Freeman and Hackman (and I can honestly say I haven't yet seen one film starring either of those two actors which wasn't in some way enjoyable). I won't bore the reader with a resume of what happened, and I am about to give away certain points about the plot. My one criticism might be that the film might well have dissected the state of Hackman's marriage to Bellucci more, which was, in fact the font of all the unhappiness. What might have been enlightening would have been an examination of the Bellucci character and exactly why she was so jealous of other younger girls that her love for Hackman had apparently turned to hatred. But what the hell, I liked it. I especially liked the final scene where Hackman and Bellucci leave the police HQ and almost meet up, but are finally kept apart by whatever private demon had made their marriage so utterly unhappy. In lesser hands this might have turned into a sentimental mawkish scene with the couple embracing and making up. But this film is honest and we get none of that Hollywood happy-end schmaltz thank goodness. This is a remake of a French film and I would be interested to see how the French presented the story. In truth, this kind of psychological film-making is unusual in Hollywood and does strike me as more European, but it is not hard to see what drew Freeman and Hackman to producing it. (NB One critic described this as a 'vanity production'. He\/she also obviously belongs in the 'didn't like it and I'm not going like anything about it' camp. Don't worry, there is nothing self-indulgent about the film.) Given that in some ways the film is rather static and much of it consists of policeman Freeman interrogating rich tax lawyer Hackman at the police HQ, director Stephen Hopkins come up with a rather effective technique to give the film a little more breadth which also adds to the intrigue.

After watching it (on DVD), I called up the IMDb pages to read what others thought of it, and, as usual, I paid rather more attention to those who 'hated it' than to the many who are apt to go over the top. Criticisms made by other members included that Puerto Rico is a Spanish-speaking island but that neither Morgan Freeman nor Gene Hackman could speak any Spanish. Then there us one gripe that this must previously have been a theatre piece because all the action takes place in one room (it doesn't really, in fact, but then that is neither here nor there). These viewers obviously belong in the camp of those who couldn't warm to the film and who pick up on each and every flaw and quirk. I, on the other hand was rather taken with it. Granted, within minutes of the film ending a number of objections came to mind - flaws - but then I didn't care I had just enjoyed a thrilling piece full of suspense with two riveting performances from Freeman and Hackman (and I can honestly say I haven't yet seen one film starring either of those two actors which wasn't in some way enjoyable). I won't bore the reader with a resume of what happened, and I am about to give away certain points about the plot. My one criticism might be that the film might well have dissected the state of Hackman's marriage to Bellucci more, which was, in fact the font of all the unhappiness. What might have been enlightening would have been an examination of the Bellucci character and exactly why she was so jealous of other younger girls that her love for Hackman had apparently turned to hatred. But what the hell, I liked it. I especially liked the final scene where Hackman and Bellucci leave the police HQ and almost meet up, but are finally kept apart by whatever private demon had made their marriage so utterly unhappy. In lesser hands this might have turned into a sentimental mawkish scene with the couple embracing and making up. But this film is honest and we get none of that Hollywood happy-end schmaltz thank goodness. This is a remake of a French film and I would be interested to see how the French presented the story. In truth, this kind of psychological film-making is unusual in Hollywood and does strike me as more European, but it is not hard to see what drew Freeman and Hackman to producing it. (NB One critic described this as a 'vanity production'. He\/she also obviously belongs in the 'didn't like it and I'm not going like anything about it' camp. Don't worry, there is nothing self-indulgent about the film.) Given that in some ways the film is rather static and much of it consists of policeman Freeman interrogating rich tax lawyer Hackman at the police HQ, director Stephen Hopkins come up with a rather effective technique to give the film a little more breadth which also adds to the intrigue.

One image is the black dress, shotgun and black goggles image of the Terminator series and the other image is that of a Green Beret as we see in Commando and this movie. This movie, The Predator, is a wonderful action movie that showcases Arnold flexing his muscles to the full, holding the meanest of guns and firearms and hunting for something that cannot be seen but is definitely out there. The movie is my personal favorite action movie of all times.The movie is about a team of special commandos led by Dutch, played by Arnold. They head out into the forest thinking that their enemies are humans. And indeed, they find their human enemies and crush them in no time. Little do they know that out there in the forest, there is a bigger and a tougher enemy hunting them down one by one. Meet The Predator, some kind of an alien life form with a very unique set of characteristics. He cannot sense the usual 3800-7600 Angstrom wavelength of light that allows us humans to see the world but he only reads off the heat given out by living creatures. He makes up for this with an incredible array of powerful weapons and the greatest advantage of them all - camouflage! Not just any camouflage but the ability to almost disappear completely. He moves around from one tree to another patiently spotting the team members of Dutch and killing them one by one.The direction and photography of the movie is simply awesome. As we see Dutch and his team wade through the forest, it really feels like we are watching some live coverage of a mission. The scenes are really well shot and at no time do we get the feeling that this is a studio set and the guns are arms are all props. The most remarkable scene of all is when all the commandos fire all their weapons into a direction hoping to shoot down the Predator. The shower of bullets and the firing of the mini-gun is simply breath taking. And considering that the movie was shot back in 1986-7, the overall movie is simply great.The final mano-e-mano encounter between Arnold and the Predator is remarkably well done. This movie is indeed one of the greatest science fiction action movies ever done. A movie that Arnie will be remembered for. Enjoy!

Actors such as Brad Renfro, Judith Barsi, the immortal Bruce Lee and the soon to be immortal Heath Ledger, who before kicking the bucket mesmerized us with one of the best on-screen villainous performances of all time, The Joker in The Dark Knight. But they will only be compared to, the first great and tragic young icon, James Dean, the young man whose title of the film I'm reviewing as you read stunningly personifies him.Dean, having starred in only three films in his career, died in a car accident. He death involved what he was embodied as; a fast life and fast cars. Yet, in this movie, he delivers a tour-de-force of acting that I have yet to see in most of today's youth actors. In this film he gives his standalone performance, one that was and will continue to be imitated or inspire other actors trying to act as a troubled youth. This film captures the adolescent cry for help, and it is done with brilliant and poignant direction.Here Dean plays Jim Stark, a rebellious young man whose attitude is presumably the cause of his parents moving from town to town. Finally, in the suburbs of Los Angeles, he makes new friends, and some enemies as well. The film is made in the '50s, a time where World War II still lingers on everyone's minds and the ongoing threat of nuclear war, which terrified citizens young and old alike. However the young, whom the adults are not paying enough attention to due to the current state of events, suffer, and eventually become involved in gangs, fights and violence. This shows the desperate cry for help by these teenagers, and even today the film still delivers the powerful and pessimistic message it has to say. Dean gives a crackling and reflective performance as Stark, here he's a psychologically scarred teenager with a circus for a family and a penchant for getting mixed with the wrong kind of people. Along the way, he befriends a mentally unstable homosexual, Plato (who is convincingly played by Sal Mineo), and falls in love with Judy, played superbly by a dazzling Natalie Wood at her peak. Make no mistake, this is classic Hollywood at its best, and most probably, at its most controversial at the time.The story and screenplay is well-written and thoughtful, though I must say, there are some flaws in the characterization department, though those are merely minor distractions from the film's true greatness. The direction is unflinching and bold by master Nicholas Ray, and the cinematography is beautiful, especially with some scenes involving the Chicken Race and the planetarium. Whoever thought of filming the movie in CinemaScope should deserve kudos, because it really gives the film a sweeping and grand beauty to it. It really sets the mood for the film.In short, although it has its downs, it's still a masterpiece, a film that should be watched and embodied by every adolescent in every generation, as this is a film that is ahead of its time by leaps and bounds.

Make no mistake, this is classic Hollywood at its best, and most probably, at its most controversial at the time.The story and screenplay is well-written and thoughtful, though I must say, there are some flaws in the characterization department, though those are merely minor distractions from the film's true greatness. The direction is unflinching and bold by master Nicholas Ray, and the cinematography is beautiful, especially with some scenes involving the Chicken Race and the planetarium. Whoever thought of filming the movie in CinemaScope should deserve kudos, because it really gives the film a sweeping and grand beauty to it. It really sets the mood for the film.In short, although it has its downs, it's still a masterpiece, a film that should be watched and embodied by every adolescent in every generation, as this is a film that is ahead of its time by leaps and bounds. It should stick to the AFI's Top 100 list, and should enter the IMDb top 250, if there are others who truly embody this genuinely bold drama.Overall quality 9.611\/10Delton ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"20 September 2008","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" The Star Trek films got off to a pretty lame start with 'Star Trek The Motion Picture' and it was obvious from watching that stiff, silly film that everyone involved had not gotten back into the Trek groove. So for the next film, they slashed the budget and went for a stripped-down, violent and sometimes even gory (by ST standards, anyway) installment that managed to hit almost all the right notes. 'Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan' is also unashamedly sentimental at the end, and even non-Trekkers were known to tear up watching Spock die. None of the Trek films are really like the old TV episodes; this and the next ('Search for Spock') come closest in approach and storytelling. The plot this time out concerns the Genesis device, a sort of bomb that creates life instead of destroying it. It's shot at a lifeless moon or asteroid and soon there are forests, rivers, sky, etc. Khan (played with great flamboyance by the one and only Ricardo Montalban) enters the picture when Chekov and his new commander stumble across the planet where he and his party have been marooned for all these years, making this a sequel to the TV episode 'Space Seed.' Kahn and his people haven't had an easy time of it on the dry, barren planet and now he is thirsting for revenge against Kirk. And to throw in the kitchen sink, the film also features an old flame of Kirk's, Dr. Carol Marcus, inventor of Genesis, and Kirk's son by her, David. There are a number of exciting scenes, and a running verbal duel between Khan and Kirk that is quite entertaining. Providing shock value are brain-eating, mind-controlling worms, native to Ceti Alpha VI where Khan and his party lived in exile, which are quite creepy in an 'Alien' sort of way. The ending, which finds Spock exposing himself to lethal radiation in order to repair the Enterprise, is very touching and would form the bridge of a story arc leading to the next two films. Unfairly or not, Gene Roddenberry was largely blamed for the first Star Trek film's excesses and plodding pace, so he was 'kicked upstairs' for 'Wrath of Khan' and had less and less to do with each succeeding movie. An interesting bit of trivia often cited by Trek fanatics about 'Wrath of Khan' is that Chekov is the first of the old crew that Khan encounters and remembers, yet the character of Chekov had not joined the crew of Star Trek when 'Space Seed' was made and so is not even in the original episode!

It sure is, in a profoundly moving and haunting way. It is set in a very surreal mansion with red walls, floors and curtains. The story concerns two sisters and a servant taking care of their other dying sister. We see scenes from each characters life. Bergman manages to express insight concerning human experience and behavior simply by showing two people interacting. He does this with a combination of acting, lighting, camera work, movement, writing and direction. It is always incredible to take in the work of someone who had mastered his or her art form. I think the single most incredible performance I have ever seen is by Harriet Andersson, who plays the sick sister in the bed. I guarantee you've never seen anything like this. This film stirs up strange and disturbingly beautiful feelings &#150;it is definitely not for everyone. Bergman addresses taboos but uses them as tools to get deeper into subjects like tenderness, hatred and death. He really explores the most profound questions in life with Cries and Whispers.If you get the Criterion DVD make sure and watch the hour-long interview with Bergman it is extraordinary candid, honest and deeeeeeep.

Just as the theme of Ferris Bueller was that life might pass you buy if you don't stop to smell the roses, the theme of Risky Business is, as stated by the dude from Revenge of the Nerds, sometimes you just have to say 'What the f*%#!'. This film goes deeper, however, as it enters the realm of strong sexual longings that anyone of the late teens\/early 20s knows all too well, as well as the pressures of parents and of society to succeed get into a good college, impress the man, make your parents dreams a reality, and wear a white collar for the rest of your life. Risky Business asks is it really worth it to sacrifice the experience of life (in this case, the surge of excitement, bittersweet memories, and longing of the late teens\/early 20s) just to be the best you can be? The haunting soundtrack by Tangerine Dream, one of my favorite bands, amplifies the bittersweet, reminiscent atmosphere excellently, especially 'Love on a Real Train', which accompanies one of the most haunting and bittersweet scenes in the film and is arguably the most well-known Tangerine Dream track ever, and for good reason.Like 'The Breakfast Club', this is one of the 80s teen coming-of-age flicks which retains its distinct 80s flavor and relevance to the era as well as being utterly timeless.
