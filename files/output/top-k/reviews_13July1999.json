Yet again (sigh),  Robin Williams plays a hero who is too far-out for his companions, most of whom somehow can't sense, or fear, the charm which the audience is supposed to feel astute for instantly recognizing.  It's pathetic.  The first thing that's provided is a quota of  uptight, humorless jerks to serve as the dull background from which Patch will inevitably stand out and shine.

I think it's a little cheap of the film-makers to suddenly paint doctors as coldhearted, insensitive jerks (near the climax of the film, the main bad-guy doctor actually says to Patch, I'm glad you finally chose to conform.

It's blatantly obvious that he's really *in*sensitive, and despite all his speeches about treating everyone humanely, he's constantly condescending and arrogant.  His mission is not to make people feel better, but to get people to bow down to him as a being superior in every possible way.  See, I'm *funny*, I *care*... And to cover their bases, they tack on the plot-tidbit that Patch gets better grades than 98% of his peers--without ever really studying.  Boy, how convenient--over and over they drive into the ground how loose and carefree Patch is, how stuffy study-sessions aren't his thing.  But how are his *grades*?  Oh, nearly perfect.

These complaints strike me as being misguided.  Is it a cliche to have the production threatened?  Maybe; but any movie about people fulfilling a quest would be senseless if there was no danger of them failing to fulfil it.  Is it a cliche to have actors fight each other behind the scenes?

Then there is the story of Vinnie ( Leguizamo in a brilliant performance ) and Deonna.  Vinnie can't have sex with his own wife without feeling like he is being rude.  So he goes out and sleeps with whores that he can have raunchy sex with.  Those are the two stories that really stood out.  But on top of that there are stories about homosexuality, race riots, racism, how stupid people are when it comes to judging someone by their appearance, the mob, sex, sex and more sex and punk rock.  I mean the film just keeps going and going and it doesn't know when to stop or exactly what it wants to say. And Anthony Lapaglia is completely wasted in this film as a detective on the case.

There are some very serious issues in whatever film it is that they are marketing but instead of trying to market it as a drama or a period piece, they make you think it is a comedy.  They make you think that you are going to walk out with a smile on your face.  In the previews there is always some scene of someone dancing with a huge smile on their face.  It such common practice now that I am surprised that Goodfellas and Schindler's List wasn't marketed as a comedy.  Sorry, that is Scorsese and Spielberg, they actually have morals and values and won't let their films be falsely thought of like that. I say all this because An Ideal Husband really wasn't that funny.  In fact I laughed as much in this as I did in Titanic.  Both were fairly serious films with hints of comedy in them.  But when watching the commercials for An Ideal Husband you are expecting to see a Jim Carrey movie.  And that it wasn't.An Ideal Husband worked for me because I was intrigued by the characters for the most part.  But as the story goes, Robert has been in office in British Parliament for quite some time now.  He is comfortable there and he has a beautiful wife as well.  Suddenly, out of his past comes a mystery lady named Lady Cheveley.  She knows about his tainted past and threatens to expose him unless he supports a bill that is about to be debated upon in the House Of Commons.  She invested a hefty amount of money in some company that will be affected terribly by his speech in the House.  He now has to decide if he is going to do the right thing and stick to his guns or if he is going to acquiesce to the blackmail.The film is funny in some parts, that is for sure.  But the Ideal Husband part of it is really just a sub plot.  There is so much more to this film than women trying to find a suitable husband.  And I wish that was told to us going into the film, perhaps it would be more popular.  I'm not sure.The film is richly acted from all participants and it has some witty dialogue, one of new favourite movie lines now is  No amount of money can buy back a man's past.  Now that is powerful.  What's done is done.  A great line.  But the movie also suffers from people doing things that you know they would not do.

When all he had to do was say HEY very loudly,  let me finish dammit.

But on a whole I was disappointed in some areas and it kept me from really enjoying it immensely.  But ya know what?  I'm in my late 20's.  The crowd I saw it with was at least two generations older than me and they loved it.  They even cheered at the end of the film.  So maybe it is a film that is enjoyed better by someone that is not so caught up in the broohaha.  Maybe this is a film to just be enjoyed and that means just sitting in the theater with your detectors off. Just enjoy.  I guess that should be advice to myself.

And that it wasn't.An Ideal Husband worked for me because I was intrigued by the characters for the most part.  But as the story goes, Robert has been in office in British Parliament for quite some time now.  He is comfortable there and he has a beautiful wife as well.  Suddenly, out of his past comes a mystery lady named Lady Cheveley.  She knows about his tainted past and threatens to expose him unless he supports a bill that is about to be debated upon in the House Of Commons.  She invested a hefty amount of money in some company that will be affected terribly by his speech in the House.  He now has to decide if he is going to do the right thing and stick to his guns or if he is going to acquiesce to the blackmail.The film is funny in some parts, that is for sure.  But the Ideal Husband part of it is really just a sub plot.  There is so much more to this film than women trying to find a suitable husband.  And I wish that was told to us going into the film, perhaps it would be more popular.  I'm not sure.The film is richly acted from all participants and it has some witty dialogue, one of new favourite movie lines now is  No amount of money can buy back a man's past.  Now that is powerful.  What's done is done.  A great line.  But the movie also suffers from people doing things that you know they would not do.  Namely, when life long friend Arthur tries to talk to Robert and explain some of his questionable actions, Robert just walks away and does not even give Arthur a chance to remedy the situation.  When all he had to do was say HEY very loudly,  let me finish dammit.  That would avoid some of the confusion that the friends were encountered with.I did enjoy the film despite my miscomings about it.  Cate Blanchet is a joy to watch.  She lights up the screen.  But on a whole I was disappointed in some areas and it kept me from really enjoying it immensely.  But ya know what?  I'm in my late 20's.  The crowd I saw it with was at least two generations older than me and they loved it.  They even cheered at the end of the film.  So maybe it is a film that is enjoyed better by someone that is not so caught up in the broohaha.  Maybe this is a film to just be enjoyed and that means just sitting in the theater with your detectors off. Just enjoy.  I guess that should be advice to myself.  And maybe I'll take it sometime and give this film another chance.

This is all the more surprising since it contains what I believe to be Sean Connery's best - certainly his most surprising,  most atypical - non-Bond performance.  'The Name of the Rose' is, as far as I'm aware (and I'm willing to be corrected) the one and only time in his screen career where Connery has played a man of thought rather than a man of action, a man who depends on his mental rather than his physical prowess, a man who would rather talk himself out of trouble than fight, a man who acts like he's the age he is; and as this man Connery is entirely convincing - entirely. When Brother William is trapped in the burning library (and what other Connery character would risk his life over some books, for goodness sake) we are seriously worried he's an old man, how on earth can he save himself?  And indeed, he has to rely on others to bring him to safety.I have read a number of reviews and articles about this film, and not one has acknowledged the radical departure Connery made from his regular persona.  Perhaps this, plus the fact that, that same year, when Hollywood finally decided to salute Edinburgh's most famous ex-milkman, they chose to honour him for his lazy, charisma-reliant performance in 'The Untouchables' (of course, that was a big hit), is the reason why Connery has played it so boringly safe ever since after all, if people aren't going to notice when you do something different, why do it at all?  Thankfully, the British Academy (BAFTA), in their last brave decision before turning into the blandest of all movie awards, gave him top prize for this film, despite its b.o. disappointment.

If you want to talk about a film that changed the way movies were made and how people viewed them, then Psycho is your film.  And the good thing about Psycho is that it is entertaining.

But this film is not ever discussed when mentioning the greatest films of all time, and maybe it shouldn't be, but it sure did as much for cinema as Citizen Kane did.I can honestly say that the shower scene in here is one of the best directed scenes in any movie.

Therefore I would surmise that the finished version will look better and slicker and, well, more finished.Branagh has taken a play which is fairly long, quite banal and filled with complex yet beautiful language and by cutting it down to 93 minutes, adding 5 or 6 song and dance routines and eliminating much of the original Shakespeare, he has managed to produce a very likeable farce.Traditionalists who hold Shakespeare in holy awe will find this film to be quite blasphemous.  However, I feel that Branagh has captured the feeling of the piece extremely well.  It is after all a slightly bawdy farce with lots of terrible jokes and a plot as shallow as a puddle in the drought season. Shakey raises it with many great and moving speeches (most by Berowne \/ Branagh surprisingly enough) and these have been lovingly restored in Branagh's film.My main gripe about the film is the ending.  Not wishing to give anything away, I shall just say that Mr S intentionally left the ending of the playvery open - even quite pessimistic(?)  Branagh doesn't.  Even this is not crushing in itself and is thoroughly understandable in order to appeal to a bland, formulaic-loving Hollywood audience.  But Branagh puts us through 3 separate endings to go along with this.The first, a usual musical device is used - to end on a spirited chorus song and dance.  Branagh treats us to this - even to the extent of bringing on all of the cast for their bows.  Then however he lets the momentum down for Ending No. 2 (the end of Shakey's play) which is slow, poignant and moving. Finally, he revs us up once again to give us a 3rd ending which the play did not contain and in my mind was superfluous to the piece as a whole.So what do I think?  I would recommend it highly for the song and dance routines, the colours, the sets, the clever use of Shakespeare and actors getting pretty damned close to the bard (Alicia Silverstone really surprised me), but if you wanted your Shakey 'as is' this isn't the one for you.

Shot over a period of four years, the director does a masterful job of presenting the lives and dreams of two young kids in the Chicago ghetto.  But this movie goes beyond that.  We get to see just how important it is for a young black kid to dream of playing in the NBA.  It is the only way for these youths to escape the cycle of poverty, to make their families proud and to be respected in a white man's world. Both William Gates and Arthur Agee start at the same level.  They both get partial scholarships from the prestigious St. Joseph's high, they both have the same amount of talent, they come from the same background.  But fate has different paths in store for them.  Gates lucks out and gets a sponsorship that would allow him to finish his education at St. Joe's.  Agee does not show improvement, no-one seems to believe in him either and he is kicked out when his parents cannot pay for half the tuition. High hopes are pinned on Gates.  The director does a terrific job of coming again and again back to Isiah Thomas'-the famous St. Joe alum- trophy case. He is the ghost that constantly haunts Gates.  The young boy is under a great amount of pressure to succeed, from his coach, from the school, from his brother -the former basketball star who never made it big-, his mother. A knee injury makes him lose his confidence and his hopes of playing in the NBA are lost. Agee, on the other hand, is thrown back in the gutter.  No one thinks he will ever make it big after leaving St. Joe's.  He is tempted by drugs and gangs, his father abandons them at a very critical time, his mother loses her job.  He no longer dreams of playing in the NBA.  He still plays ball for Marshall, a poor inner-city school.  Through another twist of fate, he leads his school to a miracle run in the state championships in his senior year and all of a sudden he can dream again. I'm giving all these details because I know this documentary is worth watching.  It's not just an insight in African-American culture, but also a story of two kids who you can root for, and perhaps even see a part of your life in them.  I was genuinely touched and moved.

Than you put Bruce Willis in the starring role and cast a wide collection of colorful supporting characters. With all this, it would be impossible to make a boring movie. In fact, this was beginning to be the best disaster movie since the Poseidan Adventure, but then they took off into space and this movie went all to hell. Bruce Willis basically plays himself as the best oil driller on Earth and is called up to destroy the asteroid heading to the Earth. Of course, Willis needs his crew to get the job done. Ben Affleck is a good young actor, but he needs to choose better roles, because all he does in this movie is place himself as a teen idol stud and not a promising actor. I think Liv Tyler is highly overrated not only in looks, but also abilities. Consider that Tyler was out-acted by Alicia Silverstone in the Aerosmith videos, that is very sad.Thankfully, led by Will Patton and Steve Buscemi, the rest of the crew is wonderful and sets this movie off with a bang during an excellent first half of the movie, showing them training and pulling off non-stop comedy and intelligent dialogue. But like I said before, than they had to take off. As soon as you see space in this film, it takes a huge nose dive. At this point, Billy Bob Thornton gains a big chunk of control in this movie and that isn't good. Thornton did a great job in Sling Blade, but since that he has virtually done a terrible job in anything since and this is no exception. The whole space mission is hobbled through the fact that too much happens with questionable possibilities. Buscemi goes AWOL, but somehow becomes a hero. Than you have to see Willis meet his fatal ending. It really sucks to see Willis die in anything. Plus, was it just me who notices that there space outfits change colors all the time while they're up in space? I don't know what they were thinking when they did the last hour or so of this film, but it seems like there were two directors and screen writers on this film. This movie is headed into history as being a great disaster film and turns into just a fun movie to watch for a while. Bruckheimer has yet to find anything as good as Top Gun still. I give this movie a 6 out of 10.

After all these things certainly go on in our society and in the lives of teens today. Any subject, as long as the the way it is presented is clever, can make a good joke.Now, I have to say that this movie was hilarious, but it also had a lot of heart.  The point of this movie was not to gross the audience out or to satirize teenage life, but to be a celebration of a difficult but fun time which all of us go through.  These characters are not one-dimensional losers as in satires like Beavis and Butthead which attack the stupidity of the generation, but real likeable people going through an extremely tough time which all of us know about.  The gross out jokes work so well in the movie, cause we all know they are true.  All of us probably know someone who would masturbate with an apple pie to get a better feeling.The performances in this movie were mostly excellent.  I especially liked Mena Suvari as Heather.  Not only is she beautiful, but she seems destined to be a romantic lead in the class of a Meg Ryan.  Jason Biggs and Eddie Kaye Thomas were brilliant as two awkward teens.  Eugene Levy is hilarious as Bigg's awkward dad. Although she was not given much to do in the movie, I think that Natasha Lyonne could be the standout of this film.  She is so great at playing girls with tough exteriors, like in Slums of Beverly Hills. In this movie, she steps up the attitude, and crudeness, giving some of the funniest lines in the script.  All in all, I would say this is a great teen movie, up there with the Pretty in Pink's and Say Anything's of the late eighties.  American Pie is hilarious not because of it's crudeness, nor is it insensitive towards women like Porkies, but because it shows in a humane way the insecurities of an everyday teen.

The plot isn't even that different or original or complex..it is nothing that we have never seen before in order for him to prepare us so much to digest(specially the ending which came out as an easy way out of a dead-end in which he probably found himself while writing the film). The performances lacked humanity and the script wasn't really helping the actors (how can anyone believe that the designer of the game was on a same level as the newbie played by Jude Law all the way...it was so stupid that there had to be something there to explain..something as stupidly convincing as what we get to know really happened in the ending). I can completely understand how some people might really enjoy this film because it looks as if it were directed to a certain group of movie goers and not your average spectator and I must say that the whole anal reference regarding the bio-ports was a pretty good idea as the chinese restaurant sequence has some of Cronenberg's best injected into it.
