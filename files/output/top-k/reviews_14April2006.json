[{"date":"14 April 2006","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" One word comes to mind Stinker! I waited thirty years for this freak show. Numbingly disappointing. A gargantuan gas bag of celluloid claptrap. Tim Burton's dreadful spin on a four-star classic renders off a slickly produced, but lethal aroma of a movie, that, when looked at closely, would have even the gorillas at the Bronx Zoo scratching their heads in disbelief. Burton's big mistake (I think) was creating a different, unfamiliar ape universe from the previous series. Strangely, I believe the film he achieved in remaking here was the Wizard of the Oz. Mark Walberg, the lead, is no Charlton Heston. He's too short and grim. Someone needed to tell him to lighten up. He spends the entire film behaving like Dorothy. I know. I know. He wishes to go home despite meeting two potential love connections--one human, one ape. AND he starts a global civil war for good measure. Nice fellow. He mopes around the planet like some kind of self-centered jerk. Tim Roth's character is the worst kind of evil boring. He jumps around the cheap sets as if he was suffering from a terminal case of ants-in-his-pants. I did, however, enjoy Danny Elfman's pulsating score. And Rick Baker's make-up for the apes deserved more recognition and some awards. Also, I felt the Christo-like red tents, that the ape army used on their march across the wasteland, were beautiful and abstract. There are occasional stabs at social commentary--but they fall flat. Rod Serling and Pierre Boulle must be turning over in their graves.
