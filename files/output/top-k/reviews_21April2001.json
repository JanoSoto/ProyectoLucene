James Goldman who did both the play and the screen adaptation did a wonderful job. Nice job on the music too, done not in his usual style, by John Barry. The acting is also first rate. O'Toole (who no doubt will be honored by the Academy posthumously one day- since they are too stupid to recognize him for roles like this one in his lifetime) IS King Henry II. He was wonderful as well in the movie Becket w\/Richard Burton. As his match- punch for punch is Katherine Hepburn. She was honored by the Academy for best actress for this movie and rightly so. She is perfect as Henry's wife, Eleanor of Aquitiane. In a terrific scene where Henry tells Eleanor he's thinking of divorcing her for another woman so he can make more heirs to the throne the dialog goes something like this Eleanor says what if she holds him back, what if they're daughtered first, what if they're first son dies...how old is daddy then? what kind of spindly, wizened, dim-eyed, gamy handed, limpy line of THINGS will you beget? Henry replies, it's sweet of you to care Eleanor and when you're dead which is regrettable but necessary, what will happen to frail Alias and her pruny prince?

Lee Egan (Timothy Hutton) puts together a crew of four men, including his brother, Roy (Harvey Keitel), to take down a jewelry store in Palm Springs, California.  If all goes well, they look to score a cool three mil in diamonds, and Lee has a fence in L.A. ready to move the merchandise.  Lee and Roy are solid, as is Jorge (Wade Dominguez), the third member of the crew who is already looking at 2 to 5 in Folsom, having been convicted of carrying a concealed weapon.  Jorge wants a quick score that will take care of his wife, Rachel (Famke Janssen), and their two kids while he's away.

While this character is certainly not a stretch for him-- you've seen `Roy' many times before, played by Keitel and others-- he does put a unique stamp on him; he's familiar, but Keitel manages to avoid letting him slip into stereotype.  And that is no easy task when you take into consideration that in reality a man like Roy would necessarily share certain traits with others of his ilk.  What makes the difference is Keitel's consummate ability as an actor, and his concern with fleshing out the details of his character.\tThe role of Lee is something of a departure for Hutton, though similar to the part he played in `Playing God,' but with much more definition.  He gives Lee a very `real' quality, the cool confidence of one who lives just beyond the fringe of what society deems acceptable.  When he mentions that he's been in Folsom, it's believable.  Dorff, meanwhile, is effective as Skip, a guy perpetually pumped and strung out, crazy-- but like a fox-- with an aura of menace about him that is nearly tangible.

The gimmick is generally great, but it's the only good thing about the film.Guy Pearce plays Leonard Shelby, a former insurance investigator with a condition (severe anterograde memory dysfunction, for those of you en route to med school) that leaves him unable to form any memories.  He introduces himself to people he's met dozens of times, he writes down anything he hopes to remember (as basic as where he's driving his car to), and tattoos the real important stuff all over his body.  The only thing he can remember is the home invasion that left him with his condition, and his drive to kill the man who raped and murdered his wife.Given this, it almost makes sense that the film plays in reverse.  The opening scene shows Leonard gunning down a man in cold blood; in the next scene that same man is alive, and we learn a (very little) bit about why Leonard has done this deed (he has a Polaroid of the man; on the back is written Don't believe his lies.  He is the one.  Kill him.).  And this is the way the movie plays, with the last line of every scene being a repeat of the first line of the previous scene.It fits quite smartly, since the camera never leaves our hero.  We're stuck in his world.  He has no memory with which to process the events he lives, why should we?  There is no way we could sympathize with this character if Memento played forward, so reverse it is.Unfortunately, if this story played forward, it would have a hatful of other problems also.  If it didn't follow the film noir playbook to the letter, it could at least keep the viewer working on untangling the confusion.

Sometimes we even like them no matter how revolting and despicable they are.  In Tailor of Panama Pierce Brosnand, as Andy Osnard fills this role to a 'T' in what's one of the most memorable new characters I have seen on film in a long time.We get no mistake about who Osnard is as soon as the film starts.  We are in MI-6 headquarters in London, and Osnard is being reviewed by his superior.  His superior returns back saying, the best he could do for him was to assign him to Panama, also commenting 'that scandal in the papers with the Spanish foreign minister's wife was bad enough, it's not like they don't know about the other ones!  They want your head Osnard consider yourself lucky!'.  To which only Osnard replies, 'It was his mistress not his wife'.  However, while Osnard is sent down, he is instructed to find out any information that might be important to 'England' regarding the security of the canal, perhaps doing everyone a favour by getting as far away from England as possible.Osnard being the scoundrel he is, fits in perfectly with the ilk crowding around in Panama, 'drug dealers', 'cons on the run', 'people who just want to dissapear'.  He decides to pick a tailor played by Geoffry Rush as an informant since many of his clients are the upper-crust of the Panama gossip source.  But it soon becomes clear that in Panama, with all the scum lying around things can get really messy where the name of the game is 'blackmail' LOTS AND LOTS OF BLACKMAIL.I went and saw this movie with my dad since he was born in Panama, and has read EVERY single John Le Carre spy novel there is.  Asking him if the story was true to the book he mentioned the ending was changed, and the witty dialogue is more of an added plus for the audience to be entertained.  But he did like the movie very much, even though the ending is more of a Hollywood happy ending instead of the real unfortunate ending as mentioned by the novel.One thing we did agree on was the setting for this great story.  Panama looks amazing and it was such a great setting.  Also Brosnan is so good as Osnard who is such a scoundrel, and Rush as the tailor who somehow just wants to wash his hands of all the dirt but can't escape it.  And what can be said of Jamie Lee Curtis!  She still looks GREAT at her age and is really good in this film as well.  A perfectly cast film.  The movie is never boring, and I never found it 'difficult' to follow.  It is a refreshing change in that it really follows along how Osnard and the tailor have to need each other to survive in this crazy land.Also the film has some memorable dialogue.'Good deeds, don't go unpunished in Panama' - former Panama resistance leader'Panama City is like Casablanca but without the heroes' - Geoffry Rush the tailor'It's time to add another star to our flag.' - American generalI was kept intrigued by how Osnard and the tailor were going about their stories, 'does he believe him', 'does he care', 'is he after his wife', 'does she care', 'is he having affair'.. there's LOTS of spy speculation  that will keep you guessing end on end.

Among the more prominent we have, `Officer and a Gentleman', `Top Gun', `GI Jane', and now `Men of Honor'.  The fact that this one happened to be true doesn't change the fact that the formula is the same.  This film is probably most like `GI Jane' since it focuses on the desegregation angle.The story is actually quite inspirational and is probably the best human-interest story among those mentioned above.  Carl Brashear (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) is unquestionably a man of great courage and principle, and his strength of character shines through brightly in this film.  Unfortunately, director George Tillman has tunnel vision in presenting the characters and eschews character development of various characters other than Brashear in favor of showing Brashear in a constant state of adversity.  Billy Sunday (Robert De Niro) is a central figure, and except for the initial scene, the fistfight and a couple of scenes with his wife, we don't know much about him.  For instance, Brashear sees the scars on Sunday's palms and we are to assume that he worked a plow, but there is no follow-up on that point.  Mr. Pappy (Hal Holbrook) gets only one short scene by which we can judge him.  The rest of his screen time shows him pacing around and ranting.  If a director is going to make a human-interest story, he needs to humanize the characters.Cuba Gooding Jr. gives an outstanding performance as Brashear.  This is probably the best I've seen him.  This is a role and a character that is far more complete than any part he has played before, and he rises to the occasion.  In `Jerry Maguire', Rod Tidwell was a fascinating, but one-dimensional character with the depth of a rain puddle.  Brashear is much more complex and grounded, and the issues he faces are life crises, making the part far more challenging.  This is an excellent recovery from Gooding's last role in `Chill Factor', a film so dreadful that it was almost an act of professional suicide to take the part.After a stint trying his hand as a comedian (`Analyze This', `The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle', `Meet The Parents'), Robert DeNiro is back to his dramatic roots with an outstanding performance.  DeNiro isn't a bad comedian, he is just such a great dramatic actor that it seems like he shouldn't waste his time doing comedy.  DeNiro endows Billy Sunday with a rock hard personality belying a tortured soul.  It is a pleasure watching him work.  It seems every film I watch lately has Charlize Theron in it.  I saw `The Legend of Bagger Vance', `Men of Honor' and `The Yards' right in a row and I was beginning to wonder if she had a part in every film in 2000 (actually, she only did five).  This was a minor role for Theron, but she carried it off well and managed to stay with DeNiro step for step.  David Keith, who co-starred with Richard Gere in `Officer and a Gentleman', has a cameo hereThe DVD has some interesting special features, including reflections by the real Carl Brashear and some deleted scenes.I enjoyed this film despite the hackneyed plot and the one-dimensional presentation.  I rated it a 7\/10.  I'm a sucker for underdog stories and I have a fondness for stories where strength of character is the central theme.  This film is particularly strong in both areas and brings us two memorable acting performances that compensate for some of the director's shortcomings.

Yes, I was once ten years old.Watched again with many years of hindsight, it's clear that, while entertaining, Beneath was produced without anything approaching artistry. The ultimate in sequels, it tries to tell the same story twice as big, but with only half the success. Until Battle came along and picked the flesh off Apes' rotting carcass this was the worst sequel because it did nothing new with the format. Even the working title - Planet of the Apes Revisited - betrays the lack of thought and the desire for finance that went into this one.A virtually identical plotline rattles along at a fair pace, meaning all subtlety is jettisoned. The allegories are also confused by not really being allegories at all. Look at the metaphor for anti-war protestors by casting chimps as ... er, anti-war protestors. A look at how man often judges another man on the colour of his skin is alluded to ... er, by having an ape judging a man on the colour of his skin. (On this note, perversely for a film that purports liberal satire, the only one of the mutants to demonstrate real cruelty was Don Pedro Colley, the sole black character in the film. And despite its worthiness, I don't think I've ever seen another film where a man's credit is given as Negro). However, I did have to smile at the chimp that punningly complains about gorilla brutality.The decreased budget (a sensible studio idea to cut the finance of the sequels to a hit movie) shows with some of the ape extras having decidedly ropy masks in the crowd scenes. The opening of the picture also recaps the first, cannily highlighting the glaring difference between Roddy McDowall's and David Watson's performances as Cornelius. Watson, standing in for an absent McDowall, does reasonably well but really doesn't look anything like him, even under latex. Note too how all the ape masks give the actors lisps, something I never noticed before. Never mind apes, anyone would think James Franciscus had landed on the planet of the Pertwees.

And as impressive as the effects are, if not directed well &#150; which they aren't, particularly &#150; then it becomes fatuous.It's weird how all four sequels were made within a year of each other, yet at least two of them tried something new.

Beneath came two years after the original yet has a rehashed in it for the money feel all the way through, right down to its abrupt, slightly unsatisfactory climax. Yet despite the many, many faults I've levelled at it, Beneath the Planet of the Apes is still a very enjoyable film. Not in the sense of the first, which genuinely had something to say, but in the guise of pulp SF then this sequel is well worth seeing. In fact, despite the slating I've given it, I still awarded it 6\/10.
