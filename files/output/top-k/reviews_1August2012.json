[{"date":"1 August 2012","score":"","review":" David Fincher's Fight Club is one of the coolest films I have seen. It is fast-paced, well directed, well written and well acted. The pace of the movie is excellent. The average movie-goer may not understand it.What people don't see is the themes this film deals with. It deals with insomnia and the insanity of the protagonist. It is anti- society, anti- consumerism, anti- corporate companies and anti- today's lifestyle. I think The Narrator suffers from insomnia because he has to work a lot, something which is quite common these days. He is fed up of his lifestyle. He finds peace by visiting cancer groups. I think he is a bit like Travis Bickle lonely, insomniac and insane. And just like Bickle, he becomes violent. I think it should be seen as a satiric thriller. That way it will be appreciated and understood better. Brad Pitt is excellent as Tyler Durden. I think his biggest strength is his ability to bring any character to life. He has done that in many of his films. Edward Norton also did very well and so did Helena Bonham Carter. The editing us top notch. The writing is excellent. Watch it. Strongly recommended.

The two adjectives that you hear most about 80s movies are 'dated' and 'trivial'. But a funny thing has happened to movies in the 00s. Most movies now are really indistinguishable from each other, no matter what the genre. Summer movies are big on special effects, with no story or good characters. Non-summer movies are either boring Indie flicks or dull mainstream bids to win Oscars. And every other movie is now a remake or a reboot! But in the 80s, it seemed like a movie could be about almost ANYTHING and still be entertaining! Even a lot of bad ones are getting re-discovered as cult classics! Go figure.They Live is another 80s movie that has managed to reach the level of cult status, but that's not surprising given the source...John Carpenter! Who is fast moving up my list of favorite directors! I already had been a big fan since the 80s of his no-holds-barred cult action comedy Big Trouble in Little China and have recently gotten around to watching (and loving!) his atmospheric and spooky horror flick The Fog. There's a nonchalance and unassuming quality with which Carpenter directs his flicks that is really inviting. He doesn't overdo it with camera action or music. Rather, he focuses on the characters and dialog allow them to drive the action, rather than the other way around, and sets a tone and mood that permeates throughout his movies. They Live starts off very methodical and slow, establishing the main character and a couple of minor ones very well while setting an ominous, foreboding tone, and once it gets going, it REALLY gets going! It had been years since I'd seen it until recently, but I remember totally liking this effort and now have come to appreciate for how psychic and clever it really is!They Live stars 80s wrestling icon Roddy Piper (in a surprisingly persuasive performance) as a John Doe style drifter who finds work at an LA construction site. There he meets fellow worker Frank (a solid Keith David) and the 2 live at a local shelter that is run by Gilbert (reliably played by Peter Jason, who later played a role in Carpenter's anthology flick Body Bags). Piper's character finds out that the shelter is a front for a secret organization, that gets raided by the police, but not before Piper finds a box of sunglasses in the group's hideout. After donning a pair of the glasses, he sees the light! The world has been infiltrated by aliens who have worked their way up through societal ranks and hold key positions of power and authority (businessmen, police, newscasters, politicians) and all the signs and media carry subliminal messages that force the general populace to conform, submit, and obey! Then there is this long sequence where Piper discovers the magnitude and scope of the alien threat via the sunglasses that is truly spooky and scary, and he proceeds to go on an alien-killing spree! During his escape, he kidnaps a local yuppie named Holly (played by the beautiful Meg Foster in an all-too-small role) and tries to convince her of the alien threat.While They Live has several moments of hilarity (most notably in some of Piper's dialog) and has a comic air about it at times, it is mostly a serious film with an important message. Piper's blasé dialog actually complements the horror and action scenes as it's coming from a character that is at a crossroads in his life he's homeless, with little to no hope of a good future, and is in last straw mode, BUT he also has a heart (as illustrated in his connections with both Holly and Frank) and morals and defeating the aliens is his way of saying that he does count and can make a difference.Yeah, I know it all sounds cheesy and cliché, but the movie never feels like that to me. While the effects are cheap (which is intended since this is a very low budget B movie) and the dialog is purposefully tongue-in-cheek, the message and the way Carpenter tells the story is most certainly NOT cheesy or cornball! They Live is actually one of the more provocative low-budget flicks I've ever seen! The drab black-and-white world that is relayed through the sunglasses is actually pretty scary-looking, relaying a cold and empty feeling. The movie is actually pretty disturbing and violent, with the big alleyway fight scene, as well as the attacks on the shelter and the underground basement, and of course in the climax. The main stars Piper, David, and Foster really do a great job with the serious moments and making the viewer believe in the imminent threat.The film's ending is simply smashing, simultaneously ambiguous and yet somehow uplifting. They Live is a pleasing blend of horror, satire, comedy, action and is grounded in a lot of truth! My fave from John Carpenter!

I watched this movie and got plunged into the most dramatic plot ever. the film started pretty simply with a aspiring small town girl Betty making her way towards the mighty Hollywood who goes to live in her aunt's exotic apartment and finds a completely clueless amnesiac woman who just had escaped from a terrible accident at Mulholland Dr. Betty helps her to find out who she is. They end up falling in love with each other then bizarre things start to happen.

After the movie completes you will just go wild and think What the hell happened in that movie and you will start developing your little theory about this movie.
