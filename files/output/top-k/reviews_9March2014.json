For example, the use of lighting around Dracula's eyes when he puts people under his trance was a great way to show the audience that his eyes are the key to this power of his.

I'll admit to enjoying the original film, but if I'm being honest I did feel that at nearly 3 and a half hours it ran on for much longer than necessary. I decided to give this film a try as it does have a reasonably good IMDb rating and I also wanted to see how it stacked up against the much loved original film.The good news is that this film is very good and it's certainly one of the better remakes that I've come across in my time. I think one major thing that runs in the Magnificent Seven's favour is that it is much better paced than the original - we get to the action and 'meat of the plot' fairly quickly and there was never a dull moment in this remake. I did feel that in the original film there was far too much time spent on finding the Samurai to defend against the village and there were moments where it did get a bit boring, but the faster pacing of the remake does make it a slightly more enjoyable experience on the whole.Next we come to the cast and I must say that Yul Brynner was exceptional as the leader of the Magnificent Seven. His deep voice and cool and calm demeanour made him an ideal choice for this role and he doesn't disappoint. Of course, one good actor can't make a film great on their own and Brynner gets lots of support from the likes of Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson and Robert Vaughan to name a few. Eli Wallach was also excellent in the role of Calvera who is the leader of the bandits. Whilst he is portrayed as a 'bad guy' in some ways I found him more to be a 'likeable rogue'. Wallach is a fantastic actor and for me he was probably the strongest actor in this film (although I'll admit that Brynner comes in a close second). The Oscar nominated score by Elmer Bernstein was also great and fitted well with the tone of the film. The Magnificent Seven also has a humorous tone running through it and this made it all the more enjoyable. There are a couple of scenes where some kids are following Charles Bronson's character around (much to his annoyance) which did make me laugh.The only minor negatives I can thing of with this film is that I didn't think the finale of the Magnificent Seven was anywhere near as exciting as the finale of the Seven Samurai. In some ways the Seven Samurai was like a Firework with a very long fuse - you'll wait ages and ages and then BANG. The finale of the Seven Samurai is one of the most exciting finales that I've ever seen. Magnificent Seven differed in that there were lots of fireworks going BANG, BANG, BANG, but then when they came to the last firework there was just a slight puff of smoke, but no BANG. The ending of the Magnificent was by no means bad, but it was disappointing in comparison to the original.One thing I will say is that if you watched the Magnificent Seven and enjoyed it then I would definitely recommend watching the original film Seven Samurai.

It seems odd to say, but he could stand for all the stiff, unflinching, immobile employers whose duty is to a strict regimen of routine while any consideration of the human element is basically superfluous. What's worse is the moment when you can sense of perverse joy in their sadism and the uncomfortable feeling that they are smarter than you are.In life this is a problem, but at the movie it is the stuff of great drama. Great villains have no filter, no rules. The space of their actions is unpredictable and worse, they can reveal levels of themselves that are deeper and cleverer than we might imagine. That is to the key to the most memorable of movie villains, Hannibal Lecter, Darth Vader, Harry Lime, Nurse Ratched, Hans Beckert, The Terminator, Dr, Szell, HAL 9000, and The Wicked Witch of the West. There is always something up their sleeve.This also key to Captain Bligh. All through Mutiny on the Bounty we follow the machinations of a man for whom duty to the crown is more important than the attentiveness to his crew, a man who is a sadist, ordering punishments and cutting rations simply because he has the authority to do so.Mutiny on the Bounty is loosely based on the real-life 1789 takeover the HMS Bounty after the ship's company and crew endured months of cruel tyranny and punishments and severe cutbacks of the basic necessities of food and water. Bligh commands The Bounty with an iron will, and we get a sense of his diseased mind even before the ship leaves port. He orders the flogging of a man charged with striking an officer even after the ship's doctor informs him that the accused is dead. He demands strict adherence to the rules even in death.Our point of view is led by Fletcher Christian (Clark Gable), the ship's first mate, an officer who is tough but very fair &#x96; he is the kind of tough but tolerable officer who can command the seas as well as his crew with a balance of humanity and efficiency. The movie that surrounds him is somewhat simple-minded. It seems loosely constructed as a model on which to portray his cruelty that leads to the inevitable mutiny.Laughton's performance is proof that even the most mundane material can be livened by one performance. And what a performance it is. It is all in his eyes. When Christian confronts him there is a buried insecurity, a paranoia that runs down into his bones. He knows that if he is too lenient on his crew that they will take advantage but if he rules with an iron fist they will keep their place.Eventually, Christian rouses the men to rise against their tyrannical master and take command of the ship. In the most famous moment, as Bligh and his loyal followers are about to be set out to sea in a small boat he makes a famous proclamation to the revolting crew Casting me adrift thirty-five hundred miles from a port of call! You're sending me to my doom, eh? Well, you're wrong, Christian. I'll take this boat, as she floats, to England if I must. I'll live to see you &#x97; all of you &#x97; hanging from the highest yardarm in the British fleet! Fletcher Christian tells him I'll take my chances against the law - You'll take yours against the sea. We are conditioned, like Christian, to believe that no man and his crew could survive against the open seas in a small boat. But we are startled to find that the most frightening aspect of Bligh is that he is really smarter than we think. Left for dead on the rough seas in a small boat with little to eat and little to drink, it is assumed that he and the crew will perish but Christian has overlooked his skills as a seaman. An expert navigator, Bligh guides the small boat on a 3600 mile journey to safety, to the coast of Timor in the East Dutch Indies while The Bounty turns toward the isolated safety of Tahiti.What stays with me in Captain Bligh is the immobile manner. There's something that we can all identify with, working for someone who is hardbound to the letter of the rules but is ignorant of the human condition. What we miss is that there's a reason that Bligh is in command and the movie reveals that when he and his crew are set adrift. Bligh, ever the master seaman, makes a 3600 mile journey in a tiny boat to Timor in the West Indies. Bearded, exhausted, he proclaims that We've beaten the sea itself.The performance would become Laughton's legacy but for Laughton himself he felt that he gave better performances elsewhere. He didn't disown the role but he felt that it didn't fill the capacity of what he could do. Yet, I couldn't deny him the performance, it is a brilliant, tricky performance, one at which a seemingly one-dimensional character outsmarts even those of us who think we have him figured out.

All through Mutiny on the Bounty we follow the machinations of a man for whom duty to the crown is more important than the attentiveness to his crew, a man who is a sadist, ordering punishments and cutting rations simply because he has the authority to do so.Mutiny on the Bounty is loosely based on the real-life 1789 takeover the HMS Bounty after the ship's company and crew endured months of cruel tyranny and punishments and severe cutbacks of the basic necessities of food and water. Bligh commands The Bounty with an iron will, and we get a sense of his diseased mind even before the ship leaves port. He orders the flogging of a man charged with striking an officer even after the ship's doctor informs him that the accused is dead. He demands strict adherence to the rules even in death.Our point of view is led by Fletcher Christian (Clark Gable), the ship's first mate, an officer who is tough but very fair &#x96; he is the kind of tough but tolerable officer who can command the seas as well as his crew with a balance of humanity and efficiency. The movie that surrounds him is somewhat simple-minded. It seems loosely constructed as a model on which to portray his cruelty that leads to the inevitable mutiny.Laughton's performance is proof that even the most mundane material can be livened by one performance. And what a performance it is. It is all in his eyes. When Christian confronts him there is a buried insecurity, a paranoia that runs down into his bones. He knows that if he is too lenient on his crew that they will take advantage but if he rules with an iron fist they will keep their place.Eventually, Christian rouses the men to rise against their tyrannical master and take command of the ship. In the most famous moment, as Bligh and his loyal followers are about to be set out to sea in a small boat he makes a famous proclamation to the revolting crew Casting me adrift thirty-five hundred miles from a port of call! You're sending me to my doom, eh? Well, you're wrong, Christian. I'll take this boat, as she floats, to England if I must. I'll live to see you &#x97; all of you &#x97; hanging from the highest yardarm in the British fleet! Fletcher Christian tells him I'll take my chances against the law - You'll take yours against the sea. We are conditioned, like Christian, to believe that no man and his crew could survive against the open seas in a small boat. But we are startled to find that the most frightening aspect of Bligh is that he is really smarter than we think. Left for dead on the rough seas in a small boat with little to eat and little to drink, it is assumed that he and the crew will perish but Christian has overlooked his skills as a seaman. An expert navigator, Bligh guides the small boat on a 3600 mile journey to safety, to the coast of Timor in the East Dutch Indies while The Bounty turns toward the isolated safety of Tahiti.What stays with me in Captain Bligh is the immobile manner. There's something that we can all identify with, working for someone who is hardbound to the letter of the rules but is ignorant of the human condition. What we miss is that there's a reason that Bligh is in command and the movie reveals that when he and his crew are set adrift. Bligh, ever the master seaman, makes a 3600 mile journey in a tiny boat to Timor in the West Indies. Bearded, exhausted, he proclaims that We've beaten the sea itself.The performance would become Laughton's legacy but for Laughton himself he felt that he gave better performances elsewhere. He didn't disown the role but he felt that it didn't fill the capacity of what he could do. Yet, I couldn't deny him the performance, it is a brilliant, tricky performance, one at which a seemingly one-dimensional character outsmarts even those of us who think we have him figured out.

It seems odd to say, but he could stand for all the stiff, unflinching, immobile employers whose duty is to a strict regimen of routine while any consideration of the human element is basically superfluous. What's worse is the moment when you can sense of perverse joy in their sadism and the uncomfortable feeling that they are smarter than you are.In life this is a problem, but at the movie it is the stuff of great drama. Great villains have no filter, no rules. The space of their actions is unpredictable and worse, they can reveal levels of themselves that are deeper and cleverer than we might imagine.

The bottom line with The Producers is it's simply not that funny and never that interesting.

In efforts to produce a play that is destined to play for one night only, Max and Leo right and produce Springtime for Hitler A Gay Romp with Adolf and Eva at Berchtesgaden, a work that is labeled a love letter to Hitler written by an ex-Nazi Franz Liebkind (Kenneth Mars), which is German for Frank Lovechild.

Mel Brooks does just about everything he can against the wall with The Producers and it's surprising and a shame to admit so very little of the humor actually sticks. To begin with, it's no denying Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder are extremely talented performers, but somehow, Brooks found the way to make both extremely tired, irritating, and tedious.

Instead, we get frequent vignettes of situations that aren't very funny simply because they're burdened by overacting and boring physical comedy. I never knew the latter words went together. Mostel and Wilder both have unbearable characters and, in return, give us somewhat unbearable performances.Brooks has made a name for himself as one of comedy's great voice and, through some mystery far beyond anything I'm willing to conjure up at the moment, The Producers has become a staple in the comedy genre. It has earned its place on the American Film Institute's one- hundred best comedy films among many film critics' favorites as well.

Of course, it's hard to argue that there's a conspiracy afoot given that the IMDb rating is apparently based on over 24,000 honest opinions, but, as with all polling, we can question whether the verdict is based on an appropriate sample group. This film, after all, was released just two months after 9\/11, making it possible that it has yet to be seen by the majority of its target audience.And who is this target audience? In my opinion, it consists of nothing less than the same rainbow-colored mainstream American moviegoers who enjoyed Airplane! to the tune of $83 million in box office receipts. Speaking of which, I found the Dance to the Music set with Martin Lawrence every bit as funny as the Stayin' Alive sequence with Robert Hayes.

When he meets a depressed woman 20 years his senior (Cloris Leachman) who is just as starved for affection, they have intercourse. For a while they find distraction from their despair.The performances in this film are uniformly strong, however, I think too much time is given to the comings and goings of vapid teenagers in heat. I'd have liked to see and learn a little more about the intriguing father figure Joe the Lion (the craggily handsome Ben Johnson). But then again, one of the lessons here is that the good things in life are fleeting. Enjoy -- and more, appreciate -- while you can!I also think there's a take-home message in Sonny. In the course of the film he does manage to grow. Starting out as fickle and unreflective, he evolves into someone who can tolerate the emotional pain of another -- Joe the Lion, and later Mrs. Popper -- without taking the easier route of running away. Definitely a role model for us all!

The story of Blade Runner's inception, first as a short story by Phillip K. Dick, through to its very troubled production, relative failure upon initial release and then the years it took on home video through numerous, slightly different cuts, to finally gain the recognition it deserves is as fascinating as any. What was once very much a cult film has now gained true classic status. Blade Runner isn't so much a traditional film in terms of narrative, more an overall audio- visual sensory experience. In it's Final Cut form, free from the much maligned voice over of the original theatrical cut, it has little in the way of plot exposition. After the scene setting text introduction the viewer is placed smack bang into Ridley Scott's Hellish vision of Los Angeles 2019 and what a vision it is. I cannot recall any film with such a strong visual style. The neon-lit, smog ridden, rain soaked, multi-lingual world Scott created is a thing of beauty like no other in film. The effects and production design take centre stage, even over plot and narrative yet service the movie in ways no one had seen before. The sublime visuals work in perfect harmony with a score by Vangelis which is one of the greatest scores in film and is a truly unique musical wonder, perfectly capturing the somber melancholy of this dystopian future. Inspired casting is another of the film's strengths. Harrison Ford's famous on set woes and personal issues with the director may have actually added to his somewhat detached, somber performance as Rick Deckard, the Replicant hunting cop brought back in for one last job who may well be one himself (my personal take is that he isn't a Replicant, probably!) Deckard is thankfully devoid of the cockiness of Ford's Han Solo and Indiana Jones and this is one of his finest performances. Rutger Hauer has never been better as Roy Batty, leader of the group of renegade Replicants. His now famous final monologue, allegedly ad-libbed to some extent, describes the film's core message of our own mortality. It remains one of the most powerful and memorable scenes in film. You don't need to know what the Shoulder of Orion is or what C-Beams are, all you need to know is that during this artificially created life-form's short life, he has amassed experiences and memories which, once he's gone, will cease to be. Sobering stuff indeed but easier to swallow when you consider that Batty, in his final moments, loved life so much, his life, even the life of the man charged with hunting him, that he saved Deckard from certain death. A simply magical finale to a truly beautiful filmI'll finish by talking about Blade Runner's influence on the modern cinematic landscape. The unique visual style of futuristic dystopia that the film showed has been copied hundreds of times since, sometimes very obviously, (Akira, The Fifth Element), sometimes more of a subtle influence, (the constant rain of the unnamed city in Se7en apes that of L.A. 2019). Either way, Blade Runner has left an indelible mark on Hollywood, Sci-Fi in particular. It's a film that may require a bit of work from its audience but once you immerse yourself in its intoxicating beauty, you'll forever be a slave to it. I pray that it's magnificence isn't sullied by an unnecessary sequel!
