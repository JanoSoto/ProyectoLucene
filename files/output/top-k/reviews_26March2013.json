[{"date":"26 March 2013","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" I hate this movie because of its premise of a spaceship blowing up Earth for ridiculous reasons that do not make sense story wise, its disjointed story. and how unrealistic the movie is. The notion that the Drej destroy our planet only because they don't want us to make planets when they are supposed to be unstoppable does not make sense. The Drej are supposed to be unbeatable because they are pure energy, yet they were beaten in the climax when their energy was drained, this is a contradiction. Plus how can both the Drej and their spacecraft be pure energy if they have tangible bodies and their spacecraft are all solid crystalline designs, this violates basic physics. Handwavium means anything that flat out violates physics and Titan AE is brimming over in handwavium.This movie is unrealistic because Earth is our only home when it is destroyed and our only hope is a handwavium device known as the Titan Project which create and makes habitable an entire earth-like planet in a short time span which violates physics. Another reason why Titan AE is unrealistic is that its villains are pure energy and solid at the same time as well as no interstellar colonies readily available for humans to go to in 3028 AD when Earth is destroyed. Titan AE despite its box office failure really taints astronomy, and that makes me furious because I love astronomy. And this review is the tip of the iceberg on why I am against Titan AE. Titan AE should not have been made in the first place. I look forward to the movie Interstellar which will open in November 2014. I would much rather watch Star Wars Episode I The Phantom Menace than Titan AE.My beef with Titan AE is that this movie views the pointless destruction of Earth by the Drej and aggressive war alike although portrayed as villainous in the film as a thrill ride. I know that both destroying for no good reason and war are not trill rides. Newsflash Titan AE, war is not a game and destroying Earth for silly reasons is not a thrill ride. Contact provided a real movie thrill ride in the scene where Ellie traveled through wormholes to far-off places in the universe. Titan AE is not even a mildly underrated; let alone criminally underrated as some of its fans claim, it deserved to flunk the box office since it is highly illogical, poorly written, selfish, stupid, and asinine.

However, back then, I did not really follow the films as much as now. I suppose I will write up a short review on some of the things I've seen.First, the story. It's a pretty intense story, an epic fantasy like no other. The one Ring must be destroyed by Evil, and who else to go and solve Middle-Earth's problems than a handful of heroes. I'm not really going to say much else about the story, because that's not what I want to focus on in this review and I'm sure many of you reading know how it goes, anyway. Now, I've listened to The Lord of the Rings Symphony more than a half-dozen times, and, although Shore's music is incredible on its own (although, when you get right down to the bare bones, surprisingly simple), it pales in comparison to when you listen to it while watching the film. The main example I use is when you are watching the very first scene with the Shire, when you see the hobbits at play, Gandalf riding his trusty steed off into the distance, blue morning sky shining... When you picture that scene, while listening to the solo violin play the beautiful melody of the Shire, you get a sense of nostalgic happiness, in a way I can't quite explain. It's just such a pleasant scene to follow the intense, nervous feel of the previous scene, where the Ring's backstory is described. Also, who doesn't get the chills when the iconic theme of the Fellowship plays, right as they are all first assembled and seen on screen? This theme repeats over and over throughout the entire series of films, but it originates in this one, and is incredible. The soundtrack for The Hobbit, the more recent film created, takes a lot of these themes and builds upon them, but without this first film, none of the music would have grown and developed.The visuals, as I sort of described earlier, are also just as amazing. There is a perfect balance of bright innocence and tense darkness, quite unlike the Harry Potter films, where it is all dark or all bright. The natural beauty of New Zealand makes the viewer feel like they've just gone back to the time of swords, and the symphonic music even more so.That's really all I have to say. I realize it isn't much, and perhaps this review can be used in conjunction with others for those who have not seen the film, but I hope for those who have can understand what I'm talking about. I think this film was the one that started the series, not the product that combined the whole series into one. It was this where everything started, and it only got better from there. I'm excited to see the rest of The Hobbit Parts 2 and 3, and I'm sure these will be fantastic films that will go right next to Harry Potter in future years.I hope this review was helpful, but even if it wasn't, I thank you for reading!

It is a strange movie and the eeriness is masterfully portrayed by the opening scene.

I was beginning to lose my interest and some of the scenes did feel weird but there was so much good things towards the very end that dragged me back into the film. One was the duel between the Samurai and the bandit. The woodchopper's story was great as was the bandit's story but boy, I felt the woman's story to get a little dull and just awkward.Some things that happened in the film such as the girl screaming in a horror like creepy way did creep me out.

Oh - and yes, the obligatory casting of the ever stellar, Steve Buscemi (really - why is he not in every movie?).Based on true events (edit just found out that the term is very loosely used here), the movie is set in mid-west, USA and the Coen brothers make full use of this happy occurrence. The residents of a small town have their comfortable routine of shoveling snow - which, going be recent reports, is pretty much all one does in Minnesota - disturbed by a triple homicide by out of town criminals. Disturbed is an over statement as it doesn't bother them enough to even spit out the gum that they've been chewing for a week; Led by the heavily pregnant police chief - Marge. Oh Marge - Luckily this movie was before Christopher Waltz came and was not made by QT else Chris would have been all over the role even it meant being a pregnant man, but I diverge - Luckily, Marge is played by Frances who knocks it out with aplomb. All charm and ma'am but cold steel when required.The Coen brother tradition of characters dying unceremoniously out of turn is celebrated in Fargo as well. See, this is what i like about Tarantino and Coen brothers type of movies - not only are they memorable in whole but even their constituent pieces are individually remarkable. There is a sense of celebration of the art of making cinema; It has an artistic purity. But - I diverge again. Where were we ? Ah yes - The camera work is fresh and the dialogue indulgent with some hilarious extended exchanges conducted only in varying intonations of the word - Yeah. Even if you haven't spent time in Minnesota, as I strangely have, it is still bloody funny to watch.This then, truly is a delicious concoction - parts Coen brother zaniness, parts Tarantano'ish violent indulgence, on a base of a Guy Ritchie plot of criminal incompetence, completed with superb performances and inspired casting.

Oh - and yes, the obligatory casting of the ever stellar, Steve Buscemi (really - why is he not in every movie?).Based on true events (edit just found out that the term is very loosely used here), the movie is set in mid-west, USA and the Coen brothers make full use of this happy occurrence.

I have only seen the remake by Peter Jackson and the 70's version left a great impression on me. It had two phenomenally good leads and was just entertaining. It's by no means a good film but more like a guilty pleasure to me. The reasons to watch this version of King Kong are Jeff Bridges and Jessica Lange. Two great actors with wonderful on screen chemistry and great acting skills. Jessica Lange gives the best performance out of all the cast and that's a huge accomplishment, since it was her feature film debut. She plays the typical damsel so well and makes her so likable that you yourself would have risked your skin for her. With a much better script, she would have gotten some serious award nominations. And also for 2\/3 of the film she doesn't wear all that much clothes on. In other words, not only she gives a really good performance and but also is sexy. Jeff Bridges does a really good job playing to lovable hippy scientist type. I always imagined that The Dude fought monkeys in his glory days before retiring to the Coen film. The rest of the cast is populated by character actors you have probably seen in other 70's and 80's genre films and blockbusters.Where the 70's King Kong differs from the original is that the motivation for the expedition is oil. There are few minor differences with the original material. There are no film crew, no dinosaurs, the ending happens on World Trade Center and so on. But the general gist of the story is the same. But sadly it's not all that well written. The first 1 hour and a half goes well and but then the terrible writing starts showing up after the monkey is captured. It doesn't break the film but it can get on some peoples nerves.The visual effects are very dated but they have certain charm to them. The monkey is a man in a suit, not stop-motion creature. For close-ups they used huge animatronics and other contraptions. It looks cool but the face of the Kong looks slightly weird at times. The rest of the production looks much better. The Skull island, in typical 70's fashion, is underplayed and looks more realistic. There are no dinosaurs or creatures except for a huge snake that Kong fights. Plus it's mostly shot on location, with few obvious sets. The tribal village looked really impressive and some of the carnage in New York was really good looking. The Kong gets killed really brutally by choppers armed with miniguns and it's bloody as hell.Aside from the problems with the lousy script, there are few scenes that just were very strange. Kong tried to sexually molest Jessica Lange and thankfully it was disrupted by a huge snake. He almost succeeded at undressing her... Yeah, she is very hot and totally worth the trouble but really guys? Do we need a rapist monkey movie? And then there were some really strange facial expressions that might cause unintentional laughter. I watched it with an open mind and enjoyed it as a big budget b-movie. And you know what? It works as that perfectly. King Kong is a good monkey movie with everyone's favorite Kong destroying New York and killing hundreds of people. I highly recommend seeing this version of King Kong. It's better than Peter Jackson's 4 hour version and has better cast than the 30's version. Jessica Lange and Jeff Bridges are more than enough to see this film. They give great performances and have great sex appeal to spare. The effects might come of as cheesy and outdated but they add certain charm to the film. But if you need top of the line visual effects and excessive action sequences or even good writing you will be disappointed.

Not only did he meet his goal, he exceeded it. The cast is near perfect, delivering some of the best performances in any Tarentino film. Pam Grier channels her old bad-ass acting career while at the same time being who she really is, making her performance so raw and dangerously cool. Robert Forster's performance was truly moving, capturing his unrequited love for Jackie so subtly, conveying it powerfully in every shot of his time on screen. Sam Jackson is Sam Jackson as always. Bridget Fonda is absolutely steaming. All except for Robert DeNiro. I couldn't get used to him playing the blithering idiot he is on screen. It made me a little uncomfortable, considering that he is a powerhouse of an actor and this role forced him to take a huge leap backwards. But I guess, somehow, its pretty cool to see him play someone else. Whats restraining me from giving this a perfect score is the movie as a whole. It just doesn't feel like a movie directed by Quentin. His body and soul is just not present here, other than his penchant for witty dialog and an impressive soundtrack. I guess I was disappointed as much people were when the film debuted. We wanted more, we expected so much, and we were let down.

The acting is first-rate, along with production values that insist on actual locales where possible. Three hours is a burden on the rear end no matter how good the film, but this one manages to hold attention throughout. The Kennedy assassination continues to fascinate, I think, because of the many threads running through it that point in several different directions.The movie itself makes a strong case for a government-led conspiracy. A brief review, however, is hardly the place to argue the merits of Garrison's case or conspiracy in general. Nonetheless, the movie succeeds in bringing to popular attention a number of holes in the Warren Commission's lone assassin theory. Crucially, however, it's well to keep in mind that filmmaking is an art and by its nature art deals with images. Now, images can be a reflection of reality, and in that sense function as an expression of truth. But imagery, of course, is not reality itself. As a result, art as a source of truth about the world, has an inbuilt limitation.I mention this caveat only as a general caution about movies in general, and not to discredit this film in particular. All in all, I think the movie represents pretty powerfully many of the key facts of key eyewitnesses involved in the most intriguing murder case of the century. Thus, the film should not be missed, whatever one's persuasion.

Stumbling upon this film, my jaw practically dropped at the sheer perfection of my find. HORROR FLICK RATED LESS THAN 4\/10 STARRING SNOOP? This was too good to be true. But oh, it was true. Just having finished watching Bones, I can fully say it lived up to my expectations and even went beyond.I won't waste your time giving you details of the plot, as it isn't necessary. I'll just highlight some of the great things about this movie that made it so enjoyable for me, and that I'm sure would be enjoyable to any fan of wonderful, campy horror flicks.Obviously the big attention grabber was Snoop's face on the cover of the film. How did he deliver? Perfectly. Snoop's acting is just ridiculous enough to smile at while still being coherent enough to be passable. There are some absolutely CHOICE bits of dialogue in this film and Snoop does not fail to entertain for a single second of his screen time.I was also impressed by the story. Going in with absolutely no expectations for a coherent story, I was actually pleasantly surprised by how plot driven this film was. The first half of the film is actually entirely based on establishing Snoop's character Jimmy, while the second half let loose with the outrageous effects and violence. I was engaged by the plot the entire time and Jimmy is actually a much more interesting character than you might figure. Obviously no masterpiece, but definitely not a mindless story and certainly entertaining.Along with an impressive story, the film also had great atmosphere. There are really three distinct settings in the film, though technically all three are in the same place! The first we're introduced to is the ghetto, run down neighborhood that is the basis of the story. A very interesting setting for a horror film, and quite frankly, a great idea as well! We've seen the haunted houses, asylums and summer camps a million times but throwing in a setting that's scary in REAL life and ACTUALLY exists works wonders. Next we have Jimmy's old house, a Gothic-style building that plays out like a haunted house. While it doesn't really seem to fit in with the urban ghetto setting, who cares, right? Dusty, dilapidated, and actually pretty creepy at some times; if you watch this alone in the dark you'll have a fun time with the spooky atmosphere in the house. Well-done! Finally we have the oddest setting, the neighborhood during the 70s! The filters they used on these scenes really give it that groovy feel so common in blacksploitation flicks, and seeing all of the actors from the modern setting done up with afros is good fun. The silliest parts no doubt, these scenes were an interesting cutaway from the dark atmosphere of the rest of the film.And finally, what it all comes down to for a lot of horror flicks the gore and sleaze! First off, the sleaze is very limited here. There is exactly one scene, a few seconds long, that features nudity. Depending on your tastes, that's good or bad; I'm pretty indifferent. What there is plenty of, on the other hand, is blood! The brutal gore is limited, but there is quite a lot of blood here, and its bright red, ridiculous color makes it even better in my opinion. It's amazing to me that they could use the amount of CGI they did in this film and STILL make the blood absolutely unconvincing, but it's definitely not something I saw in a negative way, rather just adding to the fun!Overall, what you've got here is a surprisingly serious - but still full of fun and laughs - horror flick. The story held me the whole way through, Snoop was excellent, and there were plenty of laughs to be had at some of the sillier moments. I had a smile on my face the whole time and was definitely very satisfied when the credits began to roll.

Many of the things that Sergeant Hartman said to Private Pyle were vile and disgusting in anticipation of improving his athleticism and motivating him to try harder. Ultimately, it doesn't work when Private Pyle breaks at the last day due to amount of pressure and expectation piled up on him and he kills Hartman and himself. The film also has many suspenseful moments, among them the death of Private Pyle and Sergeant Hartman and the patrol in which Joker kills the Vietnamese female sniper. The director constantly chooses to film these scenes in dark rooms or at night, only lit up by a flashlight\/moonlight or fires. The music that accompany the scenes provide an eerie atmosphere that really makes the viewer sit at the edge of his seat constantly. The movie shows the two sides of the war, the violent and brutal side of the war that most people think about when they think of Vietnam and also the oppressive and psychological style, where many Marines were pressured to get into the system of following commands and preparing for the war, which led to many Marines losing their mind. Several army terminologies that I learnt from the film were the Rifleman's Creed and the Thousand-yard Stare. A term that I connected with one of the stories in Tim O'Brien was the term sh*t, which was used constantly in this film. The two major parts in this film where the word sh*t was used was before Private Pyle killed himself, claiming he was in a world of sh*t because of all the pressure he faced and the torment he faced from the verbal and physical abuse he faced in camp and Sergeant Joker, who said that even though he was in a world of sh*t, he was glad to be still alive and he was no longer afraid. In the Tim O'Brien book, the term sh*t field is used when Kiowa sinks into a mud-filled bog and the soldiers use it often as there is no other word to describe such a place. In conclusion, I believe that this movie effectively showed the two sides of the Vietnam War that the soldiers faced and with the intense shots and appropriate music choices, it created a suspense-filled movie that really engaged me and creeped me out many times.

Was it deep? Was it intelligent? I must have just mumbled something in response. But what I was thinking afterwards was that you can't just characterize this movie as deep or intelligent. This is one of the very rare precious gems that may be correctly described as ineffable.

It's so bad and disheartening to its fanbase that I can't recall the last time I've seen a children's film so wretched and unpleasant. It's the kind of picture that is so flamboyantly bad that, after a while, you begin to cringe at the material and begin to drum up ideas on how you could've repaired its broken nature and saved thousands of people from enduring such unspeakable madness.For starters, let's get this plot out of the way. Matthew Broderick is John Brown, a rent-a-cop security guard who patrols outside the building where two scientists, Brenda (Joely Fisher) and her father (René Auberjonois) are working to construct artificial limbs than can be operated through mind control. The possibilities of such technology catch the attention of Sandford Scolex (also known as Dr. Claw and played by Rupert Everett), who steals the functioning limb with plans to replicate it and use it to evil's advantage. Brown, who gets in a horrific car accident while trying to catch Claw, has irreparable tissue damage that can only be fixed by having alternate, technological gizmos put into his body effectively making him Inspector Gadget. It's now up to him and his sly daughter Penny (a young Michele Trachtenberg) to stop him, allow justice to prevail, etc.The first problem is the pacing itself; the film moves so fast and so quickly that it could be the direct blame for young children with lower attention spans. The action is manic, the overall material choppy and inconsistent, and with situations happening too abruptly to be taken seriously and ending too quickly with no payoff. Poor Broderick is at the center of this absolute madness, thrown into so many messy, incoherent instances with no rhyme or reason, I can see him going home from the set, everyday, a disgruntled mess that would slave over a bottle of hard liquor.The second major issue here is the writing, which is worst I've seen in a children's film in a while. For once, it's not for its immaturity, as most films targeted at the youth demographic succeed in, but just for the stench of desperation this film has no problem letting loose. It tries every possible thing, even resorting to disjointed, second-long credit cookies at the end of the picture trying to leave the audience giggling at something. I laughed not a single time during the course of this film; desperation is almost never funny and that alone should be the encompassing message of Inspector Gadget.There's a term I use when describing unsubstantial movie affairs for children and that term is fast food filmmaking. It's films that seem to only exist as a cash-grab for a kids-movie-deprived season, often raking in cash from parents who are looking for a quick little babysitter for their youngsters, and in return, they get a film that does nothing but that. Instead of giving them lovable characters, entertaining and memorable fun, and a keenly wrapped moral, they are given nothing but uncreative, unfunny drudgery.This is a painful exercise to say the least. The imagination that could've spawned a wonderful adaptation of Inspector Gadget is halted by desperately unfunny writing, bland acting, awkward and frantic pacing, and to add one more nail into one more coffin, the transfer from animation to live-action. With the limited the knowledge of the Inspector Gadget TV series that I have, I can say the charm seemed to stem from the limitless possibilities that could be done thanks to the likes of 2D animation. Nudging that eclectic and visually-visceral world into the live-action world simply doesn't translate well. The dizzying sound effects, exhausting use of computer-generated gags, and tiresome slapstick instances never amount to anything aside from frustration and true tedium. With that in mind, and the fact that they completely skewed the villain of the series and provided everything with a shamelessly half-baked treatment goes to show that this particular cinematic gadget needs more than a few tweaks; it needs reprogramming.Starring Matthew Broderick, Rupert Everett, Joely Fisher, Michelle Trachtenberg, Dabney Coleman, and D.
