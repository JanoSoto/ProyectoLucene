It is apparent that there is some sexual tension between the two of them. She dumps her boyfriend, goes to a bar one night, and her professor just so happens to be there.

She writes a fictional short story based upon what happened to her that night Everyone in class accuses her of exploitation, of being a racist, etc. Her only response to the harsh criticism But it really happened!

I regret that my DVD had no behind-the-scenes commentary from the actors or director that many films on DVD offer. It would be great to hear from Harrison Ford or Julia Ormond giving their insights on the film.Julia Ormond dominated this film in every scene she was in. Having watched it so many times, it becomes clear that Harrison Ford and Greg Kinnear were deliberately creating scenes that she could dominate. In essence, the two male leads were effectively supporting actors. This tactic was great for the film, but acting egos being what they are, not a common occurrence in Hollywood. Julia has not received such support in her other films that I have seen.Something bothered me about the plot of Sabrina that I could not put my finger on. Then it hit me. What did Sabrina do all day? She helped her chauffeur father polish the Rolls-Royce and nothing more. She did not attend college or work as a servant on the Larrabee estate. Perhaps she worked as a domestic for her father in his quarters. How could a woman with such great potential have no discernible ambition?It was interesting to watch how much effort the people working at Vogue magazine devoted to transforming the awkward Sabrina that arrived at their doorstep into a polished and sophisticated woman. These people really invested themselves in helping Sabrina become the beautiful and self-confident woman of the second half of the movie. No wonder David Larrabee didn't recognize Sabrina when she returned from Paris.Harrison Ford is delicious as the scheming Linus Larrabee who sets out to hustle the naive chauffeur's daughter Sabrina. He has been so effective in outmaneuvering his business rivals, Sabrina is dead meat in his opinion. We can see his shifty eyes as he schemes to blindside her with his fake generosity and crocodile tears about his longing for a relationship with the right woman. He fakes pouring out his soul to Sabrina only to realize his revelations are all too genuine. We see him starting to really enjoy his time with Sabrina as she reveals what depths of soul she possesses. Linus is startled to find himself feeling jealousy over her attentions to her first love, David Larrabee.Greg Kinnear is perfect as the younger playboy brother, David Larrabee. David is as shallow as Linus is substantial. He has no higher ambition that to indulge in a series of romances with any attractive woman that crosses his path. He is maneuvered into proposing to his latest love interest after he expresses admiration for her skills as a physician. It turns out that the family of David's fiancée has control of a company Linus has sought to incorporate into his own business empire. The family is willing to merge if David's marriage goes forward.All that goes out the window when a suddenly gorgeous Sabrina returns from a year in Paris. David is ready to chuck his fiancée for a fling with the vulnerable Sabrina, who has always adored him. Of course, his plans for Sabrina extend no further than a few days of excitement and then off to the next conquest.Fortunatly for all concerned, Linus intervenes to prevent breaking David's engagement and losing the support that the wealthy family of the fiancée promises to provide. Linus' pursuit of Sabrina allows her to see what a shallow man David really is and that her joy with David will be very short lived.Linus keeps drawing Sabrina into interacting with him on one pretext after another. When he calls her at home, Sabrina is visibly pleased to have him invite her back to his office. At the same time, she feels her growing attraction to Linus is destroying her dream of a life with David. When Linus urges Sabrina to drop everything for a trip with him to Paris, she finally has to decide where her heart lies. Sabrina makes her choice for Linus and is most relieved to have the quandary resolved.Linus meanwhile has his own quandary. He has developed deep feelings for Sabrina and cannot bring himself to betray her for the sake of a large sum of money. He reveals the deception to her and a shattered Sabrina flees back to her beloved Paris where she had some happiness even with the loneliness she has suffered her whole life.Here is where the plot seems to slip. All Linus had to do was to keep his initial deception to himself and actually sweep Sabrina away to Paris. He could make a brief return to the USA to close the business deal and return to his love in Paris with her none the wiser. Instead, Linus comes to realize he must pursue Sabrina to Paris and attempt to patch up her shattered heart if he is to find happiness.Sabrina is startled to meet Linus in Paris waiting outside her door. He claims to really love her and want to stay with her in Paris. If Sabrina were a little more shrewd, she could have demanded Linus marry her to prove his devotion instead of taking him at his word. At any rate, we see the blissful couple on a bridge as the screen credits roll. Whether their love lasts is never resolved.In summary, even with the rough spots Sabrina is a great romantic film.

Instead, Linus comes to realize he must pursue Sabrina to Paris and attempt to patch up her shattered heart if he is to find happiness.Sabrina is startled to meet Linus in Paris waiting outside her door. He claims to really love her and want to stay with her in Paris. If Sabrina were a little more shrewd, she could have demanded Linus marry her to prove his devotion instead of taking him at his word. At any rate, we see the blissful couple on a bridge as the screen credits roll. Whether their love lasts is never resolved.In summary, even with the rough spots Sabrina is a great romantic film.

After this there's a news report that says the rich guy was actually a pedophile, so whether or not this justifies what Donnie did (it doesn't) it's good that the guy was figured out. Then Donnie goes out with this one girl and has sex with her at a party, and when he goes out into the street one night he sees the bunny guy again and kills him, or some-such, and then learns that the bunny guy is the one who saved him from getting killed by the meteorite, or something.But Donnie didn't want to give the bunny that burden (?)

He was already fortified with a solid career as an engineer who helped manufacturer and supervise the more 'humane' developments of the electric chair, lethal injection, hanging, and gas chamber methods of capital punishment. On that point, whether or not you agree with the death penalty, he worked as a professional (or at least in his mind he did, to where he was contracted all over the country). But then came the neo-Nazi\/holocaust denier from Canada who drafted Leuchter- a man who never faced defending such a man (albeit he still to this day believes any person has a fair right to a defense, and still albeit in Canada)- to go to Poland and Germany, dig up some samples off the fronts of the walls in the dilapidated concentration camps, and see if gas was to be detected. He brought back samples (undercover), gave it to a scientist, who found there were no traces of gas. Imbued by this, he wrote the 'Leuchter Report', and then everything went to hell...In Errol Morris's film of Mr. Death, Leuchter is portrayed in a very complex manner. You're not sure what to make of him going from scene to scene; he knew what he was doing was for science- he professes also to this day to not be anti-Semitic, this despite his appearances as a guest speaker with Revisionist History groups- but he wasn't the right person for the job, if the job should've even been considered in the first place. As the scientist at the Massachusets facility Leuchter (not saying what really for) brought the samples said, there wasn't enough real data to prove or disprove anything about what was in the walls. Also, Leuchter didn't do his homework on matters surrounding the camps. Any filmmaker might've just focused on this portion of Leuchter, as his most notorious moment which was his own undoing (no more career, no more wife, reduced to trying to sell half a lethal injection machine).But Morris has the first half hour of the film as an utterly fascinating dissection of the mechanics and physics of cooking a man with electricity, or the gears of making sure that injecting a man's death is by all means 'comfortable'. He's a guy who drinks, astonishingly, 40 cups of coffee, smoking 6 packs a day, and seems perfectly normal. With this prelude, we're given what seems to be another of the honorable defectives in a line of Morris films (i.e. Gates of Heaven, Vernon Florida, Fast Cheap and Out of Control). So by the time the Leuchter report story unfolds, he comes off as, in a way, more pathetic than really evil. As one of the other interviewees observes, he's not naive (hence the money he was paid and the notoriety he soaked up before the big fall in reputation), and he also believes in free speech and the right to a defense, so on and so on. He's certainly not a man one would usually want to have a cup of Joe with. But pure evil? Mr. Death is one of Morris's most peering and uncompromising documentaries, and this time his profile of this not-quite tragic figure allows for him plenty of room for contemplation- not about if the holocaust didn't happen, lord knows Morris isn't out for that, and I'm sure he would believe the jury is in, but about the dangers of pride in one's work (i.e. Leuchter wasn't Sherlock Holmes), and as well about the nature of execution itself. We're given the plethora of chilling visuals from Morris's great abstract sensibility extreme close-ups of flesh being prepared to get killed, of Leuchter preparing in one of the execution rooms, of him just walking down the side of a highway out of focus (lit wonderfully, most of the time, by Robert Richardson). And, of course, the head-on close-ups where we're getting the full scoop right between the eyes. It adds to a sense of mild-mannered terror, at least in the Leuchter bits, even when he's talking like a rational being (which is off and on).What strikes the most about Mr. Death, however, is how Leuchter justified himself by either providing some human decency, or in providing facts.

Night Shyamalan (37) film, the born in India, raised in Philadelphia director\/scenarist who, back in 1999, scored a world hit totally out of the blue with the marvelous lo fi-horror film 'The Sixth Sense'. And I'm pretty sure about it now, the M stands for magnificent. There are a lot of red threads running through his films; they're all spellbound fairy tales, always beautifully visualized and injected with a religious-philosophical message and the most prominent feature a trademark plot twist that'll drop your jaw like a drafty shed door during a heavy thunderstorm.His films are so very intelligently written; they never are what they appear to be at first sight.

This one takes a serious subject matter (the terrible experiences of American immigrants in the late 19th century)...and turns that into an 80 minute Tom and Jerry cartoon.Okay, we start off with a family of Russian-Jewish mice being persecuted by Cossack cats, so they emigrate to the USA. The youngest mouse gets separated and then must look for his family. It wasn't until after this scene ended that I realized that I was suppose to be getting exposition or come to care about these characters. It was at least another 20 minutes in before I realized that this young mouse was supposed to be the story's protagonist. Fievel acts and sounds like a real 4-year-old. Go up to a 4-year-old that you know and start following him around with a camera. As you'll see within seconds, 4-year-olds are not very compelling characters. At least Ariel and Belle had character arcs.The filmmakers are not interested in developing characters, or building emotional bonds, or exploring any of the history lessons they superficially throw at us. They just keep each scene moving aimlessly to the next. Fievel gets sold into a sweatshop. Okay, here's a chance for the story to explore sweatshops, their historical contexts, Fievel's character and his reaction to abuse...nope, they have him escape in the very next scene, without so much as a single scene explaining what they did at the sweatshop or the reason for its existence. Fievel escapes by coming up with a plan that none of the older or wiser laborers could ever have come up with he climbs out the window! Holy Crap'n'Balls! Despite the movie being sympathetic to the plight of immigrants, it actually is filled with caricatures and stereotypes. During the No Cats In America song, an Italian mouse, with Italian stereotypes sings about the mafia and his brother Tony. Later me meet a major character who's Italian American. Guess what his name is? TONY! Later he falls in love with an Irish mouse, who in case you couldn't tell was Irish by her accent, is also dressed in green! The lack of plot continues. The terror of the cats are supposed to be metaphors for the terrible experiences that the immigrants face. Of course this metaphor only goes so far if logic is applied to it (what does the presence of cats have to with the presence of sweatshops, poverty, and terrible living conditions that the mice live under?). There's a character named Warren T. Rat (ho ho, wow, what witty writing! I wonder if Voltaire worked on this script!) who apparently runs a feline protection racket for the mice. I say apparently because we never see him do this and it's only mentioned in passing. Maybe a scene of him actually doing business would've established this a bit more.And still it went on! It wouldn't end! Fievel gets captured and imprisoned so he can sing a song with a superfluous character and then escapes again! Good job, the filmmakers must've told each other, We wasted a good 10 minutes of screen time, how can we keep wasting them? C'mon, we gotta make this sucker last 80 minutes, or else I won't be able to afford a hooker for my step-son's prom. Eventually the smelly mice get rid of all the cats by building a giant Mouse of Minsk based on the Russian folk stories Fievel would hear. Too bad he couldn't have been more inspiring by doing something that kids could actually relate to or do themselves. Then a fire starts and Fievel gets separated from his homeboys. He wakes up in a slum with a bunch of bullies. How the hell did he end up there? I don't know about you, but when I go to sleep, I tend to stay in the same place; I don't wake up in a random place with strangers.

Fievel is reunited with his family and there is a moment of genuine drama and emotion. After all, this was the scene that the entire rest of the movie was written for. But does it end there? No; how dare I be so naive? We must get a tacked-on scene of a French bird showing Fievel his statue. For a film that blew all of its chances to touch on history, how nice to end on the educational fact that the Statue of Liberty was actually built by a pigeon! I feel so much wiser now! But hold on, the entire point of the movie was that the various immigrants were oppressed in the US, and that the American dream was built on lies. I happen to agree with that message, but then why the hell do you end the movie with shots of the Statue of Liberty? Yeah, let's give our kids a bunch of junk about cats and mice, dress it up with historical context to make it seem deep, and then slap on a sickeningly patriotic ending. An American Tail? That's just a nice way of saying An American Butt. Kiss mine! So, kids, did this movie teach you anything? Did you learn a single thing about the plight of Russian immigrants?

Although Hughes' films Pretty in Pink, Ferris Bueller's Day off, Planes Trains Automobiles, and The Breakfast Club are more highly remembered and regarded and all have a message to them, WEIRD SCIENCE is just a pure, fun comedy. The movie stars famed 80s 'Brat-packer' Anthony Michael Hall (as Gary) and the not-so-famous Ilan-Mitchell Smith (Wyatt) as two uber-nerds who are mocked, socked, rocked, and jocked continuously throughout the film by their 'more cool' high school counterparts. To get even and become more cool themselves, Gary and Wyatt create the perfect woman 'Lisa' (played beautifully by super duper hot and exotic 80s British model-icon Kelly LeBrock; more on her later). Late one Friday night at Wyatt's house while his parents are away, inspired by watching the classic film FRANKENSTEIN, they create her with various 80s gadgets and objects (an Apple computer, pictures from model magazines, and a Barbie doll that is connected to the parts from the popular old-style game Operation)They even give her a brain and make her super-smart! I know it sounds ludicrous, but its a fantasy-comedy, with the emphasis on comedy.Anthony Michael Hall (as Gary) is nothing short of comic genius in this movie. He just lets it all go and gives one of the most memorable laugh-out-loud comic performances. He has a great, hilarious scene early in the movie in a blues club where Lisa takes Gary and Wyatt to. In this scene, Hall mimics and sounds just like an old, world-weary, club-hanging soul brother and carries it off to perfection. He also sports 'big eyes' throughout the movie at various times to great effect and it totally works. Ilan-Mitchell Smith, even though the movie sports them as a duo, is less funny, but still he works well as Gary's sidekick and on repeated viewing is very watchable himself.Now to 'Lisa'. Kelly LeBrock! What a forgotten bombshell from the 80s! She did this movie, The Woman in Red, Hard to Kill and was never heard from again. But she ought to be remembered for Weird Science. She is 100% total hotness! Gorgeous to look at from beginning to end, she is no supporting character either. She's essentially the female lead and is totally sexy and funny. She looks and acts like she's having fun throughout. And she has some great throwaway lines ('Rex Harrison hat'; trust me, you'll laugh when you see and hear her delivery of it). Even though she is the boys' creation, Lisa is pure fun and has more personality than most humans! She's the ANTI-FRANKENSTEIN, or the ANTI-BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, if you prefer! Lisa gives Gary and Wyatt the confidence they need to become cool like the rest of their high school compadres.Also along for the fun in great supporting roles are Bill Paxton (before he became Mr. Big Shot in the 90s) as Wyatt's older, Neanderthal, jerk of a brother Chet and Robert Downey,Jr. (as one of the guys taunting and bullying Gary and Wyatt throughout). Of course, the movie has its obligatory, happy ending where Gary and Wyatt (thanks to Lisa) get the girls (a couple of standard, high school Madonnas) and well, as for the 'make-believe' Lisa, you'll be happy how it all ends up with her too. Being an 80s movie, obviously the technology looks and is very dated, but that's part of the fun. Also, there's a few moments, especially at the climactic party at Wyatt's house, that don't come off as funny as they should be, but they are few and far in between. The movie, in addition to being funny, also works as a piece of 80s nostalgia that makes you want to be in high school again w\/o any cares and makes you just want to party.A fun, funny, 80s teen flick that takes me back to the good ole days!

Although Hughes' films Pretty in Pink, Ferris Bueller's Day off, Planes Trains Automobiles, and The Breakfast Club are more highly remembered and regarded and all have a message to them, WEIRD SCIENCE is just a pure, fun comedy. The movie stars famed 80s 'Brat-packer' Anthony Michael Hall (as Gary) and the not-so-famous Ilan-Mitchell Smith (Wyatt) as two uber-nerds who are mocked, socked, rocked, and jocked continuously throughout the film by their 'more cool' high school counterparts. To get even and become more cool themselves, Gary and Wyatt create the perfect woman 'Lisa' (played beautifully by super duper hot and exotic 80s British model-icon Kelly LeBrock; more on her later). Late one Friday night at Wyatt's house while his parents are away, inspired by watching the classic film FRANKENSTEIN, they create her with various 80s gadgets and objects (an Apple computer, pictures from model magazines, and a Barbie doll that is connected to the parts from the popular old-style game Operation)They even give her a brain and make her super-smart! I know it sounds ludicrous, but its a fantasy-comedy, with the emphasis on comedy.Anthony Michael Hall (as Gary) is nothing short of comic genius in this movie. He just lets it all go and gives one of the most memorable laugh-out-loud comic performances. He has a great, hilarious scene early in the movie in a blues club where Lisa takes Gary and Wyatt to. In this scene, Hall mimics and sounds just like an old, world-weary, club-hanging soul brother and carries it off to perfection. He also sports 'big eyes' throughout the movie at various times to great effect and it totally works. Ilan-Mitchell Smith, even though the movie sports them as a duo, is less funny, but still he works well as Gary's sidekick and on repeated viewing is very watchable himself.Now to 'Lisa'. Kelly LeBrock! What a forgotten bombshell from the 80s! She did this movie, The Woman in Red, Hard to Kill and was never heard from again. But she ought to be remembered for Weird Science. She is 100% total hotness! Gorgeous to look at from beginning to end, she is no supporting character either. She's essentially the female lead and is totally sexy and funny. She looks and acts like she's having fun throughout. And she has some great throwaway lines ('Rex Harrison hat'; trust me, you'll laugh when you see and hear her delivery of it). Even though she is the boys' creation, Lisa is pure fun and has more personality than most humans! She's the ANTI-FRANKENSTEIN, or the ANTI-BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, if you prefer! Lisa gives Gary and Wyatt the confidence they need to become cool like the rest of their high school compadres.Also along for the fun in great supporting roles are Bill Paxton (before he became Mr. Big Shot in the 90s) as Wyatt's older, Neanderthal, jerk of a brother Chet and Robert Downey,Jr. (as one of the guys taunting and bullying Gary and Wyatt throughout). Of course, the movie has its obligatory, happy ending where Gary and Wyatt (thanks to Lisa) get the girls (a couple of standard, high school Madonnas) and well, as for the 'make-believe' Lisa, you'll be happy how it all ends up with her too. Being an 80s movie, obviously the technology looks and is very dated, but that's part of the fun. Also, there's a few moments, especially at the climactic party at Wyatt's house, that don't come off as funny as they should be, but they are few and far in between.

There's also a half-baked, pseudo-science fiction theme about time travel here. The night that the jet engine falls on the Darko house, we are led to believe that Donnie gets out of bed to follow a voice which turns out to be Frank the rabbit. From that point on the movie unfolds through the numerous events until Donnie is given a choice to pass through a wormhole back in time to before his girlfriend gets killed. He does so and ends up back in his bed the very night the engine falls on him. Well, it's quite simple to explain that everything that happens to Donnie before his death is all in his mind. The time travel is related to the fact that right before his death, his life flashes before his eyes, but it's not his past life, it's his future if he were to get up out of that bed before his fated death. He sees all these consequential events happen, lives them in his mind for a supposed 28 days. But in fact, it all happens within minutes. He decides in the end not to get out of his bed knowing the fate that awaits him, and he is free from himself. The movie is a whole illusion playing out inside Donnie's mind.

I would have been around nine years old when this live action movie, featuring the cartoon character in CGI animated form, first came out. I remember seeing it twice during the '90s, though I don't think I saw the whole thing both times. If I never saw it in my childhood, I may have ended up never seeing it at all, but I just rented it yesterday, for what I believe was my first viewing of it in ten years, and it left me with mixed feelings.Carrigan Crittenden inherits Whipstaff Manor, a beat up mansion, which she is not happy with, but she and Paul Dibbs Plutzker find a map leading to a treasure in the mansion, and go there to find it. However, upon entering, they soon discover that the place is haunted by ghosts! Carrigan certainly won't give up here, so she hires Dr. James Harvey, a widowed psychic, to try and exorcise the building. James and his teenage daughter, Kathleen (or Kat) move into this mansion. One of the ghosts who lives here is Casper, a lonely ghost who doesn't mean any harm, and just wants a friend, but since he a ghost, he still always scares people. Kat is scared of him at first, but he soon convinces her not to be. Unfortunately, however, Casper's three uncles, Fatso, Stinkie, and Stretch, are nasty ghosts, the kind who LIKE to scare people, and they will make Dr. Harvey's job at Whipstaff Manor more difficult! I had fairly low expectations before the last time I saw this movie. I think I liked it all those years ago, but it doesn't seem to be a very popular family movie. So, unsurprisingly, I saw a lot of mediocrity during the film. It's a comedy, and I wasn't laughing much. For example, while Kat is at school, and nobody else in the classroom knows Casper is there, he sneaks around and ties all the students' shoes together, so when the bell rings and they get up to leave, they all trip and fall. Pretty lame attempt at physical comedy if you ask me. However, there are some mildly amusing moments, like some of the ghost scare scenes. Fatso, Stinkie, and Stretch are supposed to be comic characters, and as such, they may usually not do so well, but I think they occasionally provide some amusement. Eric Idle, of Monty Python fame, plays Dibbs, and he's certainly been funnier, but his character has some good lines, such as some of the ones he says after Carrigan falls off a cliff. Also, the movie may get a bit better towards the end, with some decent excitement, as well as some rather touching moments.Overall, I think I enjoyed this movie a bit more ten years ago, so I guess it's one of those films that's more appealing to kids, despite some occasional mild language, which must be mostly what earned it its PG rating. However, it COULD appeal to some adults as well, so I won't say it's strictly for kids, though it could be fairly close. Personally, I have to give Casper an above average rating for the amount of entertainment value I found in it, even though that amount wasn't enough to make it a film I would want to watch multiple times, and quite a lot of it seemed to bore me. So, for many kids who like ghost stories, this particular ghost movie is probably enjoyable.

And seeing as we have made the world thus, by perceiving it, interpreting and assembling it, piece by piece, with our own thoughts and senses, then we must be mysteries, too.With Blue Velvet, Lynch succeeds in perhaps the highest single accomplishment art can aspire to (at a human level, anyway) he shows us that, if reality is a dream and dream reality, then we, as both the dreamers and the dream, are the ultimate unfathomables we are strangers to ourselves ","genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"27 March 2008","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" I wish we could give a film more than a 10 out of 10 rating. Because PATHS OF GLORY is one of the very few films that I'd give an 11! It is perfection. Plain and simple. It is a bare bones film, very short, and cuts to the chase. There are several fairly long scenes, yet none of them seem long and there are no wasted words, thoughts, or moments in any of the scenes. They are all perfect. Perfection is maybe an overused word, but not in this film. Directed by the great Stanley Kubrick and coming out in a great year of films 1957, this could very well be Kubrick's true greatest accomplishment.Paths of Glory takes place during WWI, but is it a war film? Debatable. It's about a regiment of French soldiers on the front lines forced into an impossible, unwinnable situation to take the 'Ant Hill' by their power-mad regimental commander General Mireau (played to 100% cold, selfish, heartless perfection by George Macready). The attack is unsuccessful (as expected) and Mireau literally wants blood for the failure (he even orders fire upon his own men for cowering back to the trenches during the unwinnable battle). The battle itself, while extremely short for a large scale assault, is technically executed to perfection with long-view wide, tracking shots of all the action so you can see everything at once. And in the middle of all of this action is brigade commander Colonel Dax (played by Kirk Douglas in truly the most impressive performance of his legendary career). Colonel Dax orders his men to return back to battle, but to no avail. He finally sees it as unwinnable as his men.In the aftermath, Mireau wants multiple executions to take place, but 'compromises' so that one man from each company in the front line battalion will be court-martialed for cowardice. 3 soldiers Paris, Ferol, and Arnaud (played by Ralph Meeker, Tim Carey, and Joe Turkel) are chosen for various reasons (one by lot, one b\/c his unpopularity, and one b\/c he knew of his company commander's part in a soldier's death). Col. Dax, a lawyer in the civilian world, represents the men. The trial is pure, military hogwash. Dax isn't allowed to present crucial information that could exonerate the men and the tribunal looks like they have already decided the men are guilty before the trial even starts. Dax has one final chance to save the men as he is given critical information by the gunnery commander that Mireau ordered him to fire upon his own men. Dax takes it to Mireau's superior General Broulard (Adolphe Menjou) in hopes of getting a stay of execution for the men, but to no avail.The film has a lot of great, memorable characters and moments that stay in the minds of the viewer long after the film is over (1) the cockroach scene, (2) two men discussing how they would prefer to be killed (slowly or quickly, with a knife or with a gun), (3) the company commander (in charge of the execution) who wrongly chose Pvt.Paris to be tried apologizing to him before the fateful execution and Paris nodding his head in forgiveness, (4) Dax telling off Broulard calling him a degenerate and that he can go to hell. (5) And finally, there's the great ending, perhaps the most memorable moment of the film where a captured German girl (Stanley Kubrick's real life wife) who sang that melancholy tune that the French soldiers hummed to in sadness as she sang it, perhaps thinking about their wrongly executed comrades in arms.Paths of Glory says a lot about not only the military, but also society itself. There are haves and have nots, those who rule and those who are ruled, the privileged and the lower class. It's a war film in the sense that it accurately depicts the grittiness and grunge of it. It's an anti-war film in the way it portrays the lunacy of parts of it, like the unwinnable attack on the Ant Hill that would have had no meaningful outcome on the war itself. It's a social film in the way it clearly delineates the high-ranking military (the establishment) and the rank-and-file soldiers (the working class). It's an anti-establishment film in that it portrays the high-ranking officers as power-hungry, self-absorbed fat cats who only want recognition. Who's the real enemy? Those we fight against or those who we thought are supposed to be on our side protecting us, but literally sending us to our slaughter to gain promotions? But most importantly, it's a human film b\/c it accurately depicts all different types of human beings, each one delineated clearly so that the viewer can either relate to b\/c we know that's how we would act or react or either abhor and despise b\/c we'd like to believe that we, or no human being, could possibly act that way.

Lane asks the inevitable question, Who are you? Superman's reply is simply a friend. That's what Superman would say. He probably would not call himself Superman lest to seem too aware of his own super magnificence, and thank god he didn't flex his arms like the ridiculous TV show of the 1950's. Fastforward 10 years. In the film Batman, a similar scene occurs at the opening with Batman apprehending some down-trodden baddies. The baddies ask the same question as Lois Lane, but the answer was I'm Batman. Almost any other response would have been superior such as I'm your worst nightmare., You don't need to know my name., even I'm Bozo the killer clown. But replying I'm Batman really was a tip-off that the script still needed serious work, a problem that continues to plague many films produced under the corporate Hollywood system. Having Batman say I'm Batman is sort of akin to Dracula saying I'm the Count! or worse I'm a Vampire! proceeded by a cruel Romanian laugh.The problem with this movie is that it couldn't quite decide if this was going to be Frank Miller's Dark Knight, which was more akin to the early 1940's strips by creator Bob Kane, or the campy 1960's show with Adam West climbing up buildings and meeting the likes of Jerry Lewis or Dean Martin on the way up. If it was trying to be like Miller and\/or Kane, it wasn't mysterious enough. If it was going to be like West, it wasn't silly enough. Certainly Jack Nicholson as The Joker is the inevitable casting choice, and since Tim Burton was at the helm, it seemed like a movie that was aiming for the dark overtones of a Miller and\/or Kane story. However, the mystery surrounding the Joker and Batman wasn't quite there.The main issue is that the movie lacks focus, as if the screenwriters had not quite thought the story through and realized what the themes should be. Miller's The Dark Returns may be the best Batman story since Bob Kane, and it certainly is a hard act to follow. Unfortunately, much of the movie is kind of a mess when you see it with a more critical eye. And I never quite felt for the characters in the way I did for the first two Superman movies.Still, if you have never seen this movie, it is definitely worth a viewing. There are definitely some great moments. Kim Basinger as Vicky Vale is outstanding, and her relationship with Batman (and the Joker) is worth the price of admission.

Clearly, Tim Roth is a fine actor who has impressed in the likes Made in Britain (1980), Reservoir Dogs (1991) and Pulp Fiction (1994), and it is to his credit somewhat that the film survives as long as it does, but I have to honestly admit that the best parts of the film are the earlier sequences that revolve around the child version of Novecento (the character that Roth plays), who's wide-eyed sense of wonder and mystique leads him up into the ship and to the grand piano so central to the plot.Alongside the interesting plot and unconventional character there are some fine performances from the supporting cast, as well as some particularly strong emotional themes, such as the ideas of loneliness and the class divide, but for me, the film really struggled to keep itself going with the short scope of the running time or the rushed, unfinished feeling found in many of the individual scenes. Admittedly, I have not seen any other Tornatore films, despite the amount of critical praise that his Cinema Pardiso (1988) has been given, but it seems that with this film he's either compromised his vision in order to appeal to a more mainstream American audience or simply, I've seen some horribly truncated, studio re-cut (which could be the case, as it would seem that Tornatore has been badly treated by US\/UK distributors in the past, who insist on cutting his films down to more easily digestible running times). If this is the case, then I sincerely apologise, but even so; I'm not sure I can imagine a film of this scope working at anything less than a suitably epic four-hour running time, akin to something like Bernardo Bertolucci's similarly set historical piece, 1900 (1976).As you could expect, the cinematography throughout is impeccably beautiful, employing haunting shots of the ocean liner drifting out of the fog like a ghost to create an entirely alien world reminiscent of Fellini's great work And the Ships Sails On (1982). The production design is also remarkable, and the attention to detail that Tornatore and his crew have put into the film is second to none, but for me, the film just failed to maintain that sense of momentum over such a short duration. The Legend of 1900 (1998) is still an interesting, remarkable beautiful looking film, but one that I feel fails to deliver on its epic potential. It is elevated somewhat by the aforementioned photography, the haunting score from Enio Moerricone and the commendable performances from Roth, Bill Nunn and the underrated Pruitt Taylor Vince.
