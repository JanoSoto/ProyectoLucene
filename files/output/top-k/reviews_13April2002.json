Which was an honest man that cared for his soldiers and was a good natured guy. The film takes place in Vietnam in some valley of death (i forget). American troops are dropped off into a valley to seek out Viet Cong Forces. This ends up being a disatrous decision where it was a set ambush by the Viet Cong.  It ends up being an hour and half of killing where the US ends up fighting to survive.What i liked I like how a movie attempted to show the Viet Congs point of view and thier feelings but fell short. Good acting and cinematography to along with. Showed how women were affected back home in the US.What i did not like Didn't like how the Amercian lives seemed to be valued much more in the film. Example is that it would show an american soildier die so vailiantly with american patriotic style whereas it would just show a vietnamese soldier get shot, grap his chest, then fall down like he was a domino piece.

I have only played Resident Evil 2 of all the video games, but I loved it, and my savaging of the movie may in some parts be unfair because I base this review on expectations arrising from the game, and other things.Now Im a huge fan of George Romero, he is the grand-daddy of zombie, and he always will be, his movies envoke a sense of claustrophobia, terror and realism (ironic I know, but if zombies did take over the earth I picture it like he does) that few other directors can accomplish, with perhaps exceptions of Dario Argento and early Wes Craven. So naturally when I found out he WASN'T directing this movie (I don't know the full story why, or if he ever was - it might have been a rumour I don't know)anyway needless to say I was dissapointed, I thought this would be perfect filler until the rumoured Twillight ends his Dead trilogy, so yeah, maybe I am biased before even watching this movie, but Im also going to give my view of the movie from the other perspective - as a regular movie rather than as something I had expectations for.Firstly, as far as this movie goes, the plot was very over the top, the characters two dimensional and the dialog was well, limited, the special effects were fantastic, I wont give away any specifics because I want this review to be spoiler free, but suffice to say it employs very good use of CGI effects and a lot of splatter, enough to keep all but the real die hard gorehounds happy. However, basically this movie can be summed up as Mission Impossible with Zombies, the zombies playing very much second fiddle for the first part of the movie.  To be perfectly honest the whole thing seemed to me to just be a very lengthy trailer for the sequel, but perhaps thats a good thing, because its got me wanting to see the sequel, and I hated the original... I think because the way its all set up the sequel will probably be closer to what I was expecting of this movie. I very much expected this movie to have the same creepy feeling as the game, confused and lost wandering around unravelling piece by piece the mystery and all the while strange things going on.. which in a way it did, but it didnt play on it.  Romero would have given it this creepiness and tension, and that would have been excellent, much better than all the cgi effects, technology on display and tomb raider-esque action.It could have been so goooooood, with a stronger plot while still basing it on the game, a little of the claustrophobia and nervous energy of Alien 3 (yes people didnt like it much but my god it was incredible for atmosphere), the terror and suspense of Dawn Of The Dead, another fantastic movie at keeping you hooked... would the zombies learn how to do things, could they survive forever, could they escape etc, and Day of the Dead, which might not have been the superior movie but it got the atmosphere just right like alien 3, and even a little extra blade 2 style ass kicking for good measure. And thats exactly what I expected, Romero to move with and be influenced by the times and to direct a tense, frightening gore packed action cracker But, alas, it was not to be, and we got that Mission Impossible with Zombies thing I talked about earlier.

Finally, Alfre Woodward offers excellent support as a tough judge who would do Judge Judy proud.*** (out of ****)Released by Paramount Pictures  ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery"},{"date":"13 April 2002","score":"","review":"  If you appreciate good cinematography, direction and like to drift into dreams this is the movie for you.

It's drastically different, in fact. The American Godzilla is a good deal smaller than the oriental original, and also a bit more polite. Whereas any kaiju monster worth it's salt would go ploughing right -through- the buildings of whatever city it'd find in it's way, Ameri-Goji has been brought up well and politely walks along the streets, merely scratching one or two buildings. Heck, with the way the buildings actually tower over the monster instead of vice-versa, it's not surprising that the military end up doing more damage than the monster does. Seeing a skinny lizard taking a walk along some American buildings I've never heard of is not my idea of a fierce monster turning a giant metropole (preferably Tokyo) into a sea of fire and debris. Compared to the Asian example, the American Goji is a monster-wimp. While initially disappointing to anyone who likes proper giant monster flicks, this different approach is not the problem. If they had done a different-style monster movie that was actually any good, the whole world would not be spitting vomit all over this film. Alas, they screwed up very royally. As soon as any of the characters opens his mouth to utter a sentence from the hopeless script, the whole thing falls to pieces.But it's a giant monster movie, so of course the plot is a bit daft and the characters aren't fascinatingly deep! It's what you should expect!, is the standard rebuttal to anyone pointing out this film's multiple flaws. Only it doesn't work so easily. You can aim for a light-plot, silly 'fun' movie and get that wrong too, after all. And that's just what happened here; you can tell whenever the writers thought they were being terribly witty, exciting or even thoughtful with a certain line. And you can also immediately tell how wrong they were. When the characters make an attempt at being funny, likeable or showing some kind of personality (maybe even -shock!- character development), they fall flat on their faces with a loud thwack and only appear... well, stupid, really. They look stupid, sound stupid and behave in an incredibly stupid fashion. And when they're not being dopey, they're downright detestable. Matthew Broderick plays a whiny git who's face you'll want to smack in, Animal is the biggest cretin to have ever walked the earth, and then... there's Maria Pitillo. Oh, the sheer horror of it. If there is a silver lining to the cloud of this movie, it's that we can rest assured that she has forever killed off her acting career with her downright ridiculous under-performance in this film. It says a lot when one person manages to stand out as the absolute worst spot in an overall extremely bad movie.Even the monster itself isn't safe from the bad script. Here and there, attempts are made to evoke sympathy for the creature as being just an animal trying to survive. It doesn't work, though, and ends up looking like everything else in this movie - an embarrassingly failed attempt at being clever and cool. But then again, it's difficult to get really excited about a monster that's really just a big load of computer pixels on the screen.There are so many other things terribly wrong with this film that one could fill an entire book with it (actually, that has already been done with the novelisation of this movie). Honorable mention goes out to the ludicrously ill-timed cuts from scene to scene which show especially painfully in the beginning of the film, and look utterly dreadful. Other examples; the monster is a wuss, for the aforementioned reasons - far too small and tame, hardly destructive, and possible to kill by puny helicopters. And that calls itself a kaiju? Or some typical American arrogance in an attempt to make the French look like a nation of evil psychopathic snobs - but even that goes wrong, as Jean Reno turns the joke around by being the only one in this film who seems to be somewhat in his right mind, lost in a sea of idiotic Americans. And the list goes on. It's just all depressingly dumb and all too obvious that this film fails hopelessly at anything it attempts. Maria Pitillo may not be able to act out a crying scene to save her life, but even she probably cried real, convincing tears before the finished product.Unless you're looking for good documentation on how -not- to do a movie, stay well away. Any of the 1970's kiddie-oriented Godzilla movies, with their ridiculous special effects and daft plots floor this sad attempt hand-down (the 1990's and 2000's Goji films blow this into orbit by just breathing at it). Quite simply because the staff knew what they were doing and had put some effort into delivering films that, while not deep or intelligent were plain good fun.

If you are confused by what I'm trying to say, then just read the rest of the review.        The movie starts with FBI Agent Wesley Doyle(Powers Boothe), as he enters the FBI building.  We find out he has been called in because a strange man has requested to talk to the man in charge of the God's Hand case.  God's Hand is the name a serial killer has given his murders, and we find out why.  We find out the strange mans name is Fenton Meiks(Matthew McConaughey), and he claims to know who the God's Hand killer is.  He tells the agent that he beleives it's his brother, Adam Meiks.  We are then took through a entire journey through is his childhood and how me comes to know this information.         When him and his brother were kids, their father(Bill Paxton), began telling him that God and angles visited him in his dreams, and during the day as well.  He told them that God wanted them to kill 'demons', they where God's Hands and had to fulfill their mission to rid the world of demons.  Fenton, who never beleived his father, but Adam beleived his father, even saw the demons along with his father.  The rest of the plot just centers around the relationship between dad and his sons, now especially, about what is going on in their lives.             This movie was directed by Bill Paxton(his first film) and written by Brent Hanley, and is done very well by Paxton for his first time.

Before 1989, these were the crown jewels of Disney. Pure classics that no one could desecrate or destroy. Unfortunately, for a long stretch, Disney lost its touch with the viewers. They released uninteresting full length features featuring short stories about Mickey and Co. Entertaining, but certainly not deep enough to become classics.Then came The Little Mermaid in 1989. There were some good Disney movies in the eighties, most notably the heart-breaking yet uplifting Fox and the Hound, and the animal translation of Sherlock Holmes called The Great Mouse Detective. There were some dunders too. The Black Cauldron was suppose to reinvigorate Disney, but instead, from what I've heard, it was dark and unfit for the target audience, children. It ranks up with Atlantis The Lost Empire as the only Disney animated features to receive a PG rating. Anyways, The Little Mermaid burst onto the screen with such life, energy, beauty, and heart that it just turned the studio around. The fantasy tale of a growing mermaid who risks it all for love captured the hearts of all. Why shouldn't it? It was romantic, funny, and very optimistic of the world we live in. Most famously, it had some of the greatest music in movie history. Under The Sea, Part of Your World, and Kiss The Girl were the best, while the supporting numbers were good as well. Lovable characters like Sebastian, Scuttle, and Flounder gave the heart to the story.It's 2002 now, and The Little Mermaid is 13 years old now, or 12. However old it is, it has aged remarkably well, showing the timelessness of the film. Disney is in a rut much like it was in before The Little Mermaid was released. So all the more people appreciate this movie. I was 12 when I first saw it, on The Wonderful World of Disney. I recorded it, and fell in love with it. I saw it every day after school for days. It became my favorite Disney film, and among my favorite-est movies ever.But I must say, at the age of fourteen now, The Little Mermaid is not my favorite Disney movie anymore. It has to do with the lack of depth in the story, a little over-cuteness feel to it. Make no mistake, I still love it, but some other richer films that the Mouse House released has impressed me more. With the way I'm going on here, you'd think I dislike this movie. That's wrong. I LOVE it. Starting with the music. My favorite is Part of Your World. I never really got into Under The Sea, and Kiss The Girl is a sap song, in the best way possible, but still, a sap song. Yeah, Part of Your World is a sap song too, but I just love the voice and the melody, and the longing.  Secondly, all the characters are just lovable. Even the villain, with a nasty wit and a look that just screams EVIL. Ariel is beautifully drawn, with her sexy red hair. The very thin waist and fish tail is not very appealing, but you can't help but get a crush on Ariel. Her father, Triton, comes off as an over-strict father, but it's easy to see how much love he has. Ariel's sidekicks, Sebastian, Flounder, and Scuttle, are lifelong friends who never stop fighting for her. The only bad major character is Eric. He's a prince, but never seems to have any active role. Just kinda sits around playing his recorder and wrestling his dog, the also lovable Max.The animation is pretty dated compared to latest offerings like the amazing Tarzan and Atlantis. But that's hardly the matter. The beauty of the film is its radiance, not in its drawings and colors.As an extra note of personal opinion, I cannot tell you how sick I am of feminists and over-worried mothers that think that letting their young daughters watch this classic movie will turn them into doomed airheads like Ariel. They claim that Ariel gets Eric's love because she loses her voice and gets legs. Excuse me? Eric was about to marry Vanessa, the sea witch in disguise, and only when Ariel got her voice back did he fully love her. And when he lost her legs, he risked his life to get her back. Another claim is that Ariel's a bad role model because she gives up her family and friends for the affection of a man she hardly knows. Well, her father destroyed all her possessions, she thought Sebastian sold her out... And just after that happened, the sea witch swoons her with promises of true love. Don't you think anybody would've grabbed that chance? Yet another claim is Ariel's tiny waist and big breasts. First of all, she doesn't have much breast to speak of. Second of all, her tiny waist is actually quite small, but who really cares? These over-zealous feminists won't be happy until a Disney movie remakes Cinderella with a Shrek-like ogre taking Cinderelly's place, and the story goes that Cindrella takes her house by force, makes her cruel step sisters and step mother into her servants, marries the prince because of her savvy business skills, and then finally usurps the throne from the king, in the end becoming an asexual single mom queen who brings prosperity to the land. Just a rant. And also, parents should guide their children to enjoy fairy tales, but also make the distinction between reality and fantasy. If they don't do that, that's just lazy parenting.So in overall, The Little Mermaid gets an 8\/10. The story's not as in depth as Beauty and the Beast, Mulan, or Tarzan, but it's just as heart-warming.

Before 1989, these were the crown jewels of Disney. Pure classics that no one could desecrate or destroy. Unfortunately, for a long stretch, Disney lost its touch with the viewers. They released uninteresting full length features featuring short stories about Mickey and Co. Entertaining, but certainly not deep enough to become classics.Then came The Little Mermaid in 1989. There were some good Disney movies in the eighties, most notably the heart-breaking yet uplifting Fox and the Hound, and the animal translation of Sherlock Holmes called The Great Mouse Detective. There were some dunders too. The Black Cauldron was suppose to reinvigorate Disney, but instead, from what I've heard, it was dark and unfit for the target audience, children. It ranks up with Atlantis The Lost Empire as the only Disney animated features to receive a PG rating. Anyways, The Little Mermaid burst onto the screen with such life, energy, beauty, and heart that it just turned the studio around. The fantasy tale of a growing mermaid who risks it all for love captured the hearts of all. Why shouldn't it? It was romantic, funny, and very optimistic of the world we live in. Most famously, it had some of the greatest music in movie history. Under The Sea, Part of Your World, and Kiss The Girl were the best, while the supporting numbers were good as well. Lovable characters like Sebastian, Scuttle, and Flounder gave the heart to the story.It's 2002 now, and The Little Mermaid is 13 years old now, or 12. However old it is, it has aged remarkably well, showing the timelessness of the film. Disney is in a rut much like it was in before The Little Mermaid was released. So all the more people appreciate this movie. I was 12 when I first saw it, on The Wonderful World of Disney. I recorded it, and fell in love with it. I saw it every day after school for days. It became my favorite Disney film, and among my favorite-est movies ever.But I must say, at the age of fourteen now, The Little Mermaid is not my favorite Disney movie anymore. It has to do with the lack of depth in the story, a little over-cuteness feel to it. Make no mistake, I still love it, but some other richer films that the Mouse House released has impressed me more. With the way I'm going on here, you'd think I dislike this movie. That's wrong. I LOVE it. Starting with the music. My favorite is Part of Your World. I never really got into Under The Sea, and Kiss The Girl is a sap song, in the best way possible, but still, a sap song. Yeah, Part of Your World is a sap song too, but I just love the voice and the melody, and the longing.  Secondly, all the characters are just lovable. Even the villain, with a nasty wit and a look that just screams EVIL. Ariel is beautifully drawn, with her sexy red hair. The very thin waist and fish tail is not very appealing, but you can't help but get a crush on Ariel. Her father, Triton, comes off as an over-strict father, but it's easy to see how much love he has. Ariel's sidekicks, Sebastian, Flounder, and Scuttle, are lifelong friends who never stop fighting for her. The only bad major character is Eric. He's a prince, but never seems to have any active role.

But all the marquees on the local Nickelodeons never posted the title I was looking for.  Perhaps they needed the room for Bubble Boy or Glitter. It seems that intellectual films have trouble finding ground here in the American heartland.  A movie like this needs to be viewed by everyone. It deals with a moving subject that is based in complete truth and disturbing facts about our history.  It can open the eyes of its audience for them to see the workings of ignorance and prejudice in everyday American life.  But to heck with that, say Midwesterners, we want to see 'Scary Movie'!A wonderful every-man actor, William H. Macy stars as Lawrence Newman in the film based on the novel of the same name by Arthur Miller.  Newman is a Fred Rodgers-type living with his mother in Brooklyn during World War II.  Everything in his life is neat and orderly until his neighbors begin expressing disgust at a local Jewish man (superbly played by David Paymer) who opens a small news stand on their block.  It is obvious that Newman (Macy) doesn't agree with the other citizens, but tries not to get involved like a lot of Americans.  When his lunkhead neighbor (played here by Meat Loaf Aday) tries to get Newman to come to one of their meetings, he simply brushes them off.  Things change for him we he buys a new pair of round wire-rim glasses and begins to look like a Jew to others.  He begins to loosen-up a little after falling in love with a beautiful typical '40s blonde bombshell and marries her (played by Laura Dern.)  This just brings about more talk of him being Jewish, and his neighbors think she's a Jew as well.  Newman believes that by telling others that he is indeed not a Jew that the trouble will end.  This does nothing but create more trouble because, well, ignorance knows no logic.Not only dealing with a good subject, this movie was beautifully filmed using sharp colors and odd camera angles.  The director shows typical uniform America of the 1940's with simple tricks such as having all the houses painted the same color and using Miller's dry but true-to-life small talk in the script. (Ya know they say we may travel to the moon in rocket ships after the war's over says Newman. That's not possible. You would be blown to bits. says his neighbor, all the while Paymer's character is picking up garbage dumped on his stand in the background.) It is almost presented in a comic book format, will a kind of surreal texture to the scenery.  Macy's character tries his best to stay in his normal life, but keeps finding himself and his new wife in very anti-semitic surroundings.  Things shown in the film, such as the Union and the businesses and hotels that only took in Christians, really existed.  Americans pushed out Jews in mainstream life as much as possible, even while Hitler's Final Solution was in full swing in Europe.  I was delighted to see a film that dealt with this shameful facet out of American history.But, of course, I had to wait till it came out on video.  It seems it is getting harder and harder to see an intellectual movie around here.  (For example, only a few theaters showed Momento last year, another very smart movie.)  Audiences in the Midwest need to see more of this kind a film.  It touches base with deep subject matter and leaves you thinking, and maybe a little motivated.
