After it was over, I believe Albert Finney was better. Not that Julia's bad, but we've seen this character before, Sally Field in Norma Rae and Meryl Streep in Silkwood, come to mind. The only difference is the southern accent that Julia Roberts smartly declined to use. Even the plots are similar; White trash woman, ignores her kids and her man because of her cause against the big mean Corporation. I do think that Julia is by far the most attractive of the bunch however. Out of the 50+ costume changes she makes in this movie (with only $74 in the bank I might add) all but two of them have her breasts popping out at all angles. I think the makers of the film made a conscious decision to have Julia parade around in sexy outfits to keep our mind off of the boring plot-line. There was never a doubt in my mind how the movie would turn out, and the fact that it was based on a true story didn't make any difference from the re-treads coming out of Hollywood for a while now (look for the real Erin Brokovich doing a cameo as a waitress in a restaurant. She's no Julia!). Erin Brokovich's cause was to bring suit against a power company for contaminating a community with chemicals it uses in its plant. The problem is the movie attempts to show you almost every victim of the contamination until the audience gets jaded and numb and it loses its impact. The movie would have been better if it had focused on one family or victim, like the child who is suffering from cancer. I wanted to feel for the victims, but it's hard to give emotion to 600+ people in a two hour movie. The sub-plots were weak as well, although the character of George, the Harley riding, lover\/baby-sitter\/maid was refreshing. I gave this movie a rating of 6 because of the performances and in spite of the story. I think by year's end there will be performances by actresses more deserving of the Oscar than Julia, but she should get a special award for most frequent use of the F-Word by an actress.

Since it was marketed as a comedy at first, it didn't sound all that appealing.When I caught it on cable later, I was pleasantly (no pun intended) surprised.  Tobey Maguire was especially good in the lead role, and Reese Witherspoon delivered the best performance I've ever seen from her, although that's not saying a lot.  Joan Allen and William Macy are great as the 50's parents who have it all together on the surface but are terribly conflicted internally.However, this film suffers from two things terminal cuteness and a 50's phobia that is so cliched it's tiresome.  The theme of the movie shifts abruptly from a standard science-fiction premise (Maguire cautions his sister not to do anything that will destroy Pleasantville's reality or they may never get back home) to a simplistic screed on racism and stifling conventionality.  Not that there's anything wrong with fighting racism, but maybe it would have been better to introduce the theme a little earlier, when the two were in the 90's.  (Yes, it DOES exist in the 90's and 00's too.)As far as the stifling convention goes, Hollywood seems to consider the 50's the Decade From Hell and takes every opportunity to let us know that.  This is the effect that the Baby Boomers have had on the entertainment industry; they feel they rescued America from the 50's by giving us the 60's and 70's.  That's fine, they're entitled to their opinion, but if I have to see one more movie based on that thought I think I'm going to puke.  Get over it -- the 50's are forty years gone already.Other than that (my soapbox commentary!) the film is really pretty good and worth watching.

The portrayal of fans knowing and caring more about the show than the cast is dead-on! And the mixed reaction of actors grateful for a show that made their career but resentful that they are known for nothing but that same show is astutely shown as well.The show arguably focuses on Captain Taggert (Tim Allen) too much, but then again, didn't Star Trek always focus too much on Captain Kirk! Tim Allen gives a fantastic performance. His vanity and inflated ego, but wonderful leadership qualities are an accurate reflection of one William Shatner.Sigourney Weaver (virtually unrecognizable) plays Madison, the Uhura-like character who has little to do but look pretty (Hailing frequencies open, Captain!). Alan Rickman plays Dr. Lazarus. His satire is less obvious and not as well-done. He almost certainly is meant to spoof Nimoy and Spock, but then why is he a doctor? The Spock element was weak, but I liked how Rickman captured Nimoy's well-known ambivalence at playing Spock. All in all, most everything rang true-- even the cheesy special effects and barren alien planet!That the Thermians show up at a convention dressed like all the other Star Trek geeks, but turn out to be the real thing is great! The reaction of the Star Trek-like cast as they find out it's real, not a T.V. show is well-done as well. The shots of the ship loudly scraping the side of the space-dock as it departs is a hoot!The movie has a lot of in-gags. From the fateful man in the red shirt to Kirk-- oops, I mean Taggert!-- losing his shirt during a fight, they were enjoyable. Having said that, though, a lot of this movie doesn't connect. As a Star Trek fan, there was so much more that could be done-- where were some laughs making fun of things like Dammit Jim, I'm a doctor, not a ..., or Kirk's ridiculously innumerable relationships with so many females, or breaking the Prime Directive for the 100th time, or what not. For a movie so aimed at Star Trek fans, they should have done more.Still, it's a good if not great watch for Star Trek fans. And I do mean fans. Those wanting to watch to only make fun of Star Trek will probably be disappointed. The movie also pays homage to Star Trek in addition to spoofing it. In fact, the last 20 minutes, in which comedy is replaced by drama, are just like an actual episode-- and not a 3rd season episode!

And I especially love the original show. This movie is completely aimed at exactly such a person as myself, so if you don't like Star Trek or are unfamiliar with the ORIGINAL series, I imagine much of the movie would be lost on you.As a Star Trek fan, the scenes of the Star Trek-like convention that opens the movie is a riot. The portrayal of fans knowing and caring more about the show than the cast is dead-on! And the mixed reaction of actors grateful for a show that made their career but resentful that they are known for nothing but that same show is astutely shown as well.The show arguably focuses on Captain Taggert (Tim Allen) too much, but then again, didn't Star Trek always focus too much on Captain Kirk! Tim Allen gives a fantastic performance. His vanity and inflated ego, but wonderful leadership qualities are an accurate reflection of one William Shatner.Sigourney Weaver (virtually unrecognizable) plays Madison, the Uhura-like character who has little to do but look pretty (Hailing frequencies open, Captain!). Alan Rickman plays Dr. Lazarus. His satire is less obvious and not as well-done. He almost certainly is meant to spoof Nimoy and Spock, but then why is he a doctor? The Spock element was weak, but I liked how Rickman captured Nimoy's well-known ambivalence at playing Spock. All in all, most everything rang true-- even the cheesy special effects and barren alien planet!That the Thermians show up at a convention dressed like all the other Star Trek geeks, but turn out to be the real thing is great! The reaction of the Star Trek-like cast as they find out it's real, not a T.V. show is well-done as well. The shots of the ship loudly scraping the side of the space-dock as it departs is a hoot!The movie has a lot of in-gags.

It never really establishes whether or not it thinks what the characters are doing is wrong.  Once you think you have the answer(can't give away a hint), it throws a 180 on you. I also didn't like the Cliff character, which is strange considering every IMDB poster has loved him.  I thought the other two roomates, Buckley more so, had better scenes.  Another problem I had was with the pointless female subplot.

The only redeeming part about this was the fact that the South African accent of another character was even worse.Why did Tom hide out in an outback sheep station?

Out of my friends, there were no guys who disliked it and there were no girls who liked it. That's not sexist, it's a fact. I'll tell you why I think these numbers turned out this way. Becuase it does not have a happy ending. It's not a fairy tale. So I guess it's not a good movie because the hero doesn't kill the bad guy at the end. Give me a break. Arlington Road has the best ending since the Usual Suspects. The ending is the very thing that makes it so great. It's new, it's different, and a lot of people are not open minded and want to see the same ending every time. I'm not one of them. I celebrate movies like this because most studios are not brave enough to make them. Bad things do happen. That's what this movie is saying. It's more realistic in that way than any terrorist film I've ever seen. There are some plot holes in the film and Jeff Bridges does a lot of overacting, but the general idea is very smart. There are a number of edge-of-your-seat scenes. A lot of people complain that the ending is unrealistic because of precision purposes. It was a remote bomb.

In an artistic sense, does it advance the language of cinema?  Well, perhaps not as much as some other films have, but it did have a style of its own.  Some of the shots are simply marvelous, truly expressive without resorting to hammer and tongs. And the cinematography matches the subject beautifully.  While it's not Citizen Kane or Breathless, it certainly makes a contribution far above and beyond the call.What makes this movie great is its story--rarely has narrative film achieved such grandeur on a scale that is so small.

And yet the story is immense.  Comedy, tragedy, romance, desperation, treachery, love, death, infidelity, ennui, abandonment--it's all there, and portrayed with the loving caress absent in so much narrative film.Now, the power of the narrative certainly exists in the novel, but the actors and the director take the story to heart and lift it above mere words and into the sublime.  Everyone is note-for-note perfect in their acting. Everyone!  But Cloris Leachman--I don't know that I've ever been more blown away by a performance than by what Cloris Leachman achieves here.  I have no words that would do her justice--it's not even worth trying.  I guess all I can say is that repeated viewings have not dimmed the power of what she creates.

Other movies may outclass The Last Picture Show in one area or another, but I haven't seen one that combines these elements with such gentle, overwhelming power.

It is particularly annoying given that the plot chosen to replace it is so bog-standard and predictable.  An honest hero is framed for something he didn't do and spends the rest of the movie trying to clear his name and out the real spy... This seems to be the plot of every third blockbuster these days - two titles released just before MI using exactly the same storyline spring to mind Judge Dredd and Schwarzenegger's Eraser.  It was also totally un-necessary to take the hero of the original series and make him the villain of the movie - can you imagine a film version of The Untouchables with the cops hot on the trail of the evil gang boss Eliot Ness?  There is also the fact that the movie is deeply insecure; one feels that it would like to be a cold-war style espionage picture but does not have the courage of its convictions so tacks a cheesy and implausible action sequence onto the end.  I could go on, but at the end of the day, my list of criticisms are all are all pretty subjective, and don't really point to this being a bad film, simply one that I don't like.    But then suddenly it struck me.  The reason I find this movie so intensely pointless, and the reason I think it's no good, is that so many scenes are so stupid, or just completely extraneous.  Take for example the films most memorable moment - the break in to the CIA building to steal half of the 'NOC' list.  We are told that this is the most secure room in the entire world, that it has every security system known to man.  Except, it seems, a plain and simple good old CCTV camera!  Sure, the scene is well directed and a fair amount of tension is wrung from it, but if you take a step back to think, it's preposterous.  Besides, by my reckoning there is no reason for Hunt even to have the real NOC list if he is planning on double bluffing simply to smoke out the spy, so the scene shouldn't even be there.  Why would he endanger all those agents by handing over the real list? Nit picking?  Certainly, but it sums up for me why the whole thing is a waste of time.  There are plenty of movies one can enjoy by checking ones brain in at the theatre door; but when a movie cloaks itself in a supposedly complex plot and encourages the audience member to engage his or her brain, and then doesn't even stand up to scrutiny, I find the whole process deeply depressing - more so when the film takes itself as seriously as this one evidently does.  I can't even be entertained anymore, because I am acutely aware of how shallow, empty, and ultimately pretentious it all is.  So sorry folks, but if you ask me this is a red herring wrapped up in a Macguffin, wrapped up in a shaggy dog story with fleas, all designed for the sole purpose of making Tommy look good.  It's a real shame that the supporting cast, production values, direction etc are all so high, since the film itself is so thoroughly worthless.
