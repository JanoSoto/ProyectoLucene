It's easy to see why . It's a story that involves a nobody standing up to a powerful and corrupt organisation and doing the right thing , of one man making a difference . However it's impossible to watch this once you know the background of the director Elia Kazan . A Turkish immigrant to America he started off in theater and along with Lee Strasberg introduced something called  Method acting  where the actor gets in to the psychological depths and motivation of their character and effectively becomes that character . Where as previously film stars like Clark Gable , Errol Flynn etc etc were always playing a different shade of themselves a new breed of actors in the 1950s such as James Dean and Marlon Brando brought the method acting style to cinema and the method hit new heights in the late 1960s and 70s with New Hollywood . Perhaps we should be thankful for Kazan ? Maybe but the downside was Kazan was not a nice person at all from a very important moral viewpoint This film features a corrupt union who are fleecing the workers and lining their own pockets . The Waterfront Crime Commission are very interested in bringing down this corrupt union but they have a problem in that no one wants to talk to them and the union are more than happy to arrange accidents for suspected informers such as throwing people off roofs and fearing that former boxer Terry Molloy might snitch on them because they murdered the brother of a girl Molloy is falling in love with decide to put heavy pressure on him . You might like to consider that a couple of years previously Kazan was more than happy to testify in front of The House Of Un-American Activities and named eight former colleagues he knew from the American communist party with these eight people then being blacklisted . In effect he grassed them up and stabbed his friends in the back .With friends like that who needs enemies ? Continually this film screams that informing on  bad guys  is all that's needed for good to defeat evil and unfortunately while being a red might not necessarily make you a bad person there does seem to be some sort of moral equivalence of being a murderous gangster and someone suspected of leftist leanings . I mean it doesn't matter what someone has done because if they've done something wrong then they've only got themselves to blame if someone snitches on them isn't that right ? . A snitch is a good thing There's also a large dose of irony . The only character with a moral compass is Father Barry played by Karl Malden . Yeah I mean a Catholic priest makes for a superlative role model . Yeah I'm sure if Father Barry found out about a paedophile ring for example he'd be round the police station right away naming names ? Or maybe not . After the death of a longshoreman who knows too much Father Barry pleads in the name of Jesus for the workers to rise up against their cruel union bosses who are taking the bread from hungry babies and using it to pay for expensive suits .Let's think about this for a tiny second . If the character of Barry wasn't a priest and just an ordinary worker , and who doesn't mention Jesus and pointed out the exploitation the workers were experiencing what sort of person would Barry be ? No doubt a good guy but one with leftist , almost certainly fundamental Marxist leanings , in which case he'd automatically be blacklisted as a filthy red .

I don't simply understand what the others find so amazing about this film. The rating absolutely doesn't fit. The Deer Hunter is long and boring, insulting, full of nonsense and misinformation.One big disappointment has come when I found out that this is no war film. There is a little footage from Vietnam and almost nothing from combat. It is called war film so I expected war. I don't want to speak about the nonsenses like Russian roulette all over Asia, 7 years long Russian roulette carrier, saving friend from Russian roulette through playing Russian roulette... Man I got sick of Russian roulette here, too much of it. These things have been already mentioned in other reviews.I want to talk about the editing and script. As I thought The Deer Hunter is a war movie, I've expected something like 10 - 15 minute introduction and then training or directly Vietnam war where you can see some gradual character's development through the realism and horrors of war. I was mistaken. After first promising 5 minutes comes the 50 minutes long(!!!) wedding situation which is probably supposed to teach us about the main characters and get like them, but it goes on and on and seems like never-ending bore! It is literally empty! While watching this I was at first like Ok, this will last about 10 minutes, no problem. After another 10 minutes Ok, half an hour, I can take this. After 45 minutes God, it looks like the first half of movie is just wedding! The pace was so slow and it didn't change during the whole film. Additionally, the amount of information you learn during this sequence could be told in 5 minutes. You learn that our friends like drinking alcohol, doing mess, hunting, shouting, fighting, wasting beer, being loud all the day and that they eventually go to the Vietnam. I've seen movies where such behaviour was funny or at least tolerable, but here it is so annoying when it occurs like each 5 minutes! On the other hand there is nothing told about their background, their motives, how and why did they get to Nam war... I really wanted to learn why Cazale (Stanley) is such an idiot, pointing that little gun at people all the time. The characters are really unlikeable from the beginning except DeNiro and Walken maybe. The wedding and hunting situation ends with moving moment where one guy is playing piano and other friends are staring at him.After long 65 minutes!!, the movie immediately moves to a village in Nam, where DeNiro shoots one VC and then meets his friends (what coincidence). There is no explanation of how they joined the army, how they got there, nothing. 10 seconds after meeting, few grenades explode outside the village and at this point the film immediately jumps again tho the scene where our friends are imprisoned in a tiger cage or what in a VC camp. And again no explanation of what and how. Poor editing. While watching the Deer Hunter, I was getting the feeling that the movie is somehow ripped apart, incoherent.This brings me to another issue. I didn't find out what is the main story to follow. Is it the wedding and DeNiro's secret love to Meryl Streep? Is it the promise that DeNiro will never leave Walken in Nam? Is it about the way our friends deal with war? What is it? I think there should have been some main plot, otherwise it's difficult to get interested in the movie.There is also heavy load of scenes which are unnecessarily long or unnecessary at all with meaningless dialogs. Consider for example the sequence where they argue about the boots before they go hunt. First of all Cazale gets out of car and repeats five times This is not it. Then they eat, do mess, shout, fight for mustard, throw bags, waist beer and throw food again. (Everyone who likes order must find it disturbing and I do) Then, Cazale asks DeNiro if he could borrow his boots. DeNiro says no. Cazale doesn't know if NO means NO or YES so they argue, DeNiro says that Cazale forgets every time, Cazale says that DeNiro is gay, DeNiro says couple more times NO, friends ask him what is the matter with him and both Cazale and DeNiro end up angry. This lasts almost 10 minutes and every bit of the scene is meaningless! And impact of this scene? It has no impact on the story at all! Movie goes on after this and DeNiro and Cazale behave like nothing happened. The editor could have cut out this scene and nobody would even mention! You don't see any explanation for what has just happened or what was the DeNiro's motive to be so strict about the boots. It's typical for Deer Hunter. It is not like there is some room for you to guess how it could have happened. There are some serious holes in the film.The scenes like these, especially wedding situation where 10 minutes would have sufficed, should have been reduced or deleted and Cimino should have paid more attention to explanatory scenes, which could have made the movie cohesive.Last problem I want to mention is the sound of Deer Hunter. Have anybody of you noticed too, that The Deer Hunter is pretty loud? I mean the voices of our characters are silent in comparison with the noise in the background (factory, wedding, Saigon...). In order to hear the voices I had to keep volume on higher level and it has made watching the movie really uncomfortable for my ears because of the noise in the background. I loved quiet moments in DH.The Deer Hunter is one of the biggest disappointments I have ever experienced in film watching. I gave one star more for DeNiro who was in spite of all the cons good as always.

But that's okay because it's just meant as pure entertainment. This movie is awesome, and especially for a film that is over 75 years old. For some people it's hard to go back and watch old classics and still have fun with them. But with Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn you know your getting the best of the best performances.And to be quite frank, this may be Cary Grant's best performance, at least that I've seen. Usually he plays the slick guy who investigates, or leads the women out of trouble. But in this film he plays a character who is insecure, and never accomplished something in his life, and of course unsure of marriage. That is until Hepburn comes in and steals his heart. I liked her in this role even more than The Philadelphia Story, which is considered to be one of the greatest rom-coms in history. In my opinion Bringing Up Baby is better. For a 1938 film, it actually had me wondering how they filmed some scenes, especially with the leopard. Filming a leopard on screen with Oscar nominated actors is more impressive than some of the FX current filmmakers do today.Seriously though, this movie is pure gold in terms of comedy. And normally for old movies like this it has the same old premise, but in fact Bringing Up Baby is a much different film and at times unexpected.

Usually he plays the slick guy who investigates, or leads the women out of trouble. But in this film he plays a character who is insecure, and never accomplished something in his life, and of course unsure of marriage. That is until Hepburn comes in and steals his heart.

Filming a leopard on screen with Oscar nominated actors is more impressive than some of the FX current filmmakers do today.Seriously though, this movie is pure gold in terms of comedy.

I'm glad that so many people have enjoyed this film without reservations and remember it fondly. Coming to a first viewing as an adult, there were points that gave me pause.For a story set in France there seem to be rather few characters who sound French-- but I suppose the idea is that American children will more readily connect with familiar accents. Eva Gabor's elegantly Continental Duchess seems right at home, but somehow her kittens turned out pure USA. Well, these aren't the things that matter to kids.It's too bad that the period setting wasn't developed further; the music in many period pieces is inoffensively anachronistic, but putting jazz into 1910, at the height of the ragtime era, seems like a wasted opportunity. It wouldn't have been too hard to concoct a fun gang of cats who played snappy rags.Giving the 'hepcats' identities largely through nationality isn't so bad (again, not many French in this Paris), but the 'Chinese' cat?!! I know other reviewers must have commented on this notorious racial faux pas. 'Shun Gon' appears to be a Siamese, but with the squinty eyes, buck teeth and broken English more typical of a wartime anti-Japanese propaganda cartoon. He even plays piano with chopsticks, just in case we hadn't already gotten the joke about those quaint, funny Far-East types. Evidently at the Disney studio, even in 1970, all Asians were alike-- and were caricatures. How could any major organization based in California be so oblivious to the presence and feelings of the many Chinese, Japanese and Thai Californians, not to mention those living elsewhere?

I hope that was a deserted building! (with a harp in it?) Who'd be repairing the damage?

A second inning onto the American market, Chow Yun Fat, lives this film up. I agree, he is the coolest Asian actor, who can act. Speaking of actors, their all terrific. Wahlberg's solid as the young rookie, undercover cop, partnered with the shady head of the Asian task force, Fat, who thinks he can play on both sides of the law and still come out clean and cool, like his parading self. Ric Young who's the godfather of Chinatown, controlling the whole corrupt show, while buying a few cops, is so slick and slimy, in his role, he's lovable, a big paunchy China doll. Most impressive though as rising hood, climbing up the ladder, very quick before his time, is Byron Mann, as Bobby Vu, while too, I also liked Brian Cox, always solid, as Wahlberg's, bum of a gambling, ex cop, and weathered father, who always implores his son to get him out of his indebted messes. Too, The Corrupter has an darn interesting story, if sometimes confusing, and this I think could be it's fault, where to un confuse it, you might have to wrack your brain a bit. But it has more meat to it, than Chow's last simple storied, show and cool action piece, The short, sharp, and sweet actioner, The Replacement Killers. Also I liked Paul Ben Victor as the Head FBI chief, butting heads with Fat, a mutual and silent hate exchanged. Fat shows great emotion, especially in parts where he finds out, he's bitten off more than he can chew. Too, you will notice some faults in some action parts of The Corrupter, but Foley, has crafted a very slick action pic, the early scene with Fat shooting up a light store, had me underestimating the action side of it, when I saw it at the cinema in 99. From here, it was confirmed I was in for one hell of a ride. The movies cool from the word go, and I mean from the word Go the cool, deviously, and shady fitting music score by Carter Burwell as the opening credits fade in and out of The larger font movie Title was an impressive start, where an explosion in the first scene, is a great invitation, which you'll get here among a little bit of T and A, too that doesn't go astray, where Fat always looks after his partner. The action finale on that big ship, even though played out a bit, is climactic, involving and again, cool, if shockingly affecting, not just for one thing. Foley too, plays around with some beautifully overhead shots of the big Apple. Here's a film he should be proud of, despite a lot of negativity from a few real movie critics, towards it.

The theme of this film is Stay Gold (The Outsiders). The meaning of this phrase is that people should remain innocent to the harsh realities of life. The phrase Stay Gold was explained in this film through Robert Frost's poem Nothing Gold can Stay (The Poetry of Robert Frost). This poem explains that when something is new it is gold or innocent, as it progresses the gold or innocence fades away. His poem concludes that no one will stay innocent. In addition to this poem, they use the sunset as a simile for staying Gold. Johnny explains the comparison to Ponyboy when Ponyboy recites Robert Frost's poem and admits he does not know what it means. The sunset is a simile to staying Gold because when the sunset rises or it is new the color of it is gold just as when a person is young they are innocent. When the sunset is fading away and is turning into night it loses its gold color, like when someone grows up they lose their innocence. The theme does get complicated in the film. There are points in the film where it is suggested that there is no hope in living or trying to be innocent when one of the innocent characters die. There are also times in this film when it is not certain who contains innocence and if it can be regained. It seems that some characters in this film are reminded of their wrong doings and try to make a difference. It is also questioning when the characters realize that they cannot change the society. Even though the theme seems complicated at times, the music really portrays the main ideas in the film.The music in this film was well thought out and portrayed the theme and the plot of the movie. The music was produced by Carmine Coppola who also produced the music for the Godfather films (Carmine Coppola). The music was presented in a post-romantic style, similar to Gone with the Wind (Hickman, Roger). I believe they chose this style for the movie because Ponyboy and Johnny were reading Gone with the Wind throughout the film. Most of the music in the film was orchestrated with woodwinds and strings with chords long in duration and had a slow tempo. This gave it a very lush and romantic feel to it. They incorporated leitmotifs to portray the theme as well. Gloria by Van Morrison played whenever the people who had lost their innocence were in a scene. This song was very upbeat and the singer had a very raspy sounding voice. It was the only song in the movie that had lyrics to it in the movie. I believe that they made this the only song that had lyrics because it was played in the opening scenes and the rebels of society needed to look cooler and more modern than the rest of society. There is also a leitmotif for the innocent characters. The song is the instrumental version of Stevie Wonder's Stay Gold which was written for this film. This song is played whenever there is a sunset in the background, when Ponyboy and Johnny are discussing Staying Gold, and when Ponyboy is talking to Cherry about how nothing is ever going to change between the Greasers and the Socs. Not only is this song the leitmotif, the lyrical version of the song plays in the opening credits foreshadowing what will happen in the film.The opening credits do a great job in foreshadowing what will happen in the movie. The lyrical version of the song Stay Gold has great meaning to the theme of the film. One verse You thought that all would last forever, but like the weather, nothing can ever and be in time, stay gold clearly talks about the simile of the weather and innocence and how nothing can stay gold (Stevie Wonder). Although that was the main example of how the opening credits portray the film, there are many more. The sunset is in the background while it is also flashing pictures of the different places the scenes take place at such as the railroad and an old abandoned church. The way they show the credits also symbolizes the segregation between the Greasers and the Socs. The Greasers character and the actors who played them were displayed first on the right side of the screen, and the Socs were displayed after on the left side of the screen. I personally, loved this film. The usage of music in this film was excellent and the film really captured the essence of the book. The lighting of the film made the movie look as though it was taking place in the 60's. Not only did they do well on casting the of characters, the costumes really captured the different societal standings. The main thing that I loved about this film is that it stuck to the main points of the book well. It was shot in the spot that the author had it take place at and she had a major input on what happened during the production.Overall I would highly recommend watching this film because it is a film that has a timeless theme and because most people can relate to the plot of the film.Work Cited Carmine Coppola.

Over time, Robbins will make other friends, some of whom will be absolutely paralyzed by freedom in the straight world. Even better than Birdman of Alcatraz, The Shawshank Redemption creates the world of overbearing closure that is prison.

The plot was captivating, the characters larger than life, and the music was stunning.I wasn't aware of the term spaghetti western when I first saw it, but I did notice certain things that stood out, such as the use of wine instead of liquor in a certain scene, and the not quite sync of the actors lips as they spoke. I was touched by the horror of war and the emotion displayed by the characters. I too, felt like shedding a tear at a certain point.

The film depicts a character who is very lonely. I like the way that Robert De Niro did Travis Bickle, the character who is very lonely. It kind of resembles a little bit of my lifetime. I used to be lonely when it comes to friends who are very important. Anyways, another thing about this is that the music. I like the way the songs were put in the film and how they were from different artists. What Martin Scorsese did was unbelievable in a good way. He not only directed this film, but he also participated in the acting. We may not see him exactly in the film, but his silhouette is very good. The only bad thing about this is that there was a little too much crime in this film for me. I'm not used to crime, unless I see it in superhero movies. Overall, this is another film that people have to see again.

And lions are not the kings of the beasts. It just sucks! It is my least favorite movie of all time. If I was to chose between watching the lion king and Attack of the Killer Tomatoes, I would chose Attack of the Killer Tomatoes. I have no idea what people see in this movie. I would give it a negative number if I could. HYENAS KILL LIONS! I just hate it. TIGERS ARE THE KINGS OF THE BEASTS! NOT LIONS! I have to say, I was very disappointed, the only good thing was the music. Honestly, I wish those lions starved to death and I am glad that simbas father died. I hate Disney for making people hate hyenas. I LOVE THOSE GUYS! They are AMAZING! In fact, I like them better than humans! I just can't wait to be king. To bad you will have to wait forever. By the way, wildebeest can not trample and ADULT MALE LION! Way to go on the details there. Disney has to make a movie about hyenas being good because honestly, hyenas are not more evil than humans.
