It truly was brilliantly made given the budget for the time and they managed to jump start an iconic series that has lasted almost three decades! Honestly, the first part of the film, the first hour is really a 6\/10 B movie shlockfest that is entertaining but really nothing spectacular. Then, the Predator makes himself known, and the last twenty minutes or so when its no holds barred Predator vs Arnie it just amps this film up to action film legendary status. The setting for the film is perfect, the thick lush jungle giving way to the ideal place for all the insane kills and violent war scenes. They even manage to open the film with a battle against soldiers that has essentially nothing to do with Predator and yet makes the film even more interesting and fun and sheer entertainment. I think for its time the special effects are pretty decent, and hold up even now. And of course you can't ignore the iconic one liners Stick around! and my personal favourite Get to the Chopper! No matter how you shake it, this is an action film classic.Much can be said about Arnold Schwarzenegger's acting. The thing that can't be denied is his incredible screen presence. He is larger than life and has this chemistry when he is on screen. Predator also solidifies Arnold's status as a complete bad-ass. His roars of war and his campy line delivery and he stills looks like the meanest SOB and the only man who can take on this alien monster. While the supporting cast are really mostly just fodder for the Predator the writers actually gave them some solid personality and characters. 80's sidekick legend Carl Weathers is his usual serious and glaring self as Dillon. The scenes between him and Schwarzenegger are perfect and the side story of their long time friendship and the betrayal is well placed. Bill Duke, Jesse Ventura, Sonny Landham and Richard Chaves are all good rounding out the rest of the team. The one character I would have liked to have seen more from was Sonny Landham whose character Billy seemed to have a lot of depth and a back story that would have been interesting to explore a little bit. Elpidia Carrillo plays the only female in the film and she does alright. I think she was basically put into the movie to have a female presence but its mostly unnecessary. There is no romantic story between her and any of the characters (which is good) and her performance is okay but un-needed ultimately.Whatever happened to John McTiernan? How did this guy start two of the greatest action franchises in history plus a handful of other top notch action flicks and then nothing else for almost a decade? This was McTiernan's second film and his talent is obvious. He knows how to tell the story and utilize the characters perfectly. The man is an action genius. Predator might not have been the first film to combine distinct recipe for action with a horror flare but its probably one of the best. The special effects are decent as I mentioned but the Predator, that's where the money shot is. He is impressive and disturbing and overwhelmingly awesome. In one of my favourite all time scenes when the Predator throws down his weapons and removes his mask to challenge Scwarzenegger's Dutch...his appearance is simply outstanding. It actually made my skin crawl and as only Arnold can put it You are one ugly... If you love 80's action, if you love Schwarzegger and sci-fi and horror...this is truly one of the greats!! 8.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"2 February 2013","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" The beauty of Predator (which other reviewers pointed out) is that it truly is a B-Movie type monster flick but made inherently better by a solid director and the incredible star power of Arnold Schwarzenegger.

And to call it disappointing would be an understatement. Why the hell people praise this so much is anyone's guess. The movie is an overlong, dull, pretentious mess with no plot, no substance and hardly any action. The only good things about the movie were Lee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes (who was underused) and Eli Wallach as Tuco (even though he didn't convince as a Mexican), and some of the music. Scenes are padded out at ridiculous length for absolutely no reason. And the tone of the film. Is it a spoof? Is it a black comedy? Well it fails at both. The tone is all over the place and there's just no realism anywhere but it's played out as if the audience is supposed to be taking it's plot seriously. In one sequence, Van Cleef sits across the dinner table intending to kill a man if he doesn't give him any information and the man just sits there fearing for his and his family's life with a gun around his waist. He doesn't even attempt to kill Van Cleef, even though he has a chance. And Clint Eastwood (who I usually like) just sleepwalks through the film as if he as an invisible shield around him, and the scenes where is life is saved twice from the hands of Tuco (right on cue) are beyond stupid. I like a story, especially in an epic movie, not just characters roaming around and bumping into each other. Which is exactly what happens. The whole movie is a series of coincidences thrown together to try and create a plot. The events that happen are illogical and farcical. Eastwood and Wallach do a bounty hunting scam in the same town as Van Cleef, who is looking for a man who knows the whereabouts of some gold. Then Eastwood ditches Wallach and Wallach tracks him down. Later they just happen to come across the same soldier Van Cleef is looking for about the gold. Some time later, they are captured and just happen to be put in an army camp where Van Cleef (now as a soldier too) also is. The contrived situations go on. It's lazy writing, episodic and laughable the way the movie progresses.Even the so-called classic three way climatic shootout is dull beyond words and what actually happens when the fingers finally hit the triggers doesn't justify the five minutes you have to sit through waiting for it because the outcome is predictable from the start.

Maybe not the best, or always the most enjoyable but definitely my favourite.No film &#x96; anywhere &#x96; has ever (nor is likely to ever again) approached the artistic masterpiece that is TRON. Every frame is a work of art. TRON will always stand as the quintessential motion picture artwork of the 20th century.The artwork of TRON was constrained by the technology available at the time. However it is these same constraints that make the art of TRON so captivating, simple and visually wonderful. It's a bit like clearing your house of all the clutter and discovering the beauty of gazing upon clean framed windows and freshly painted walls.So much has been said about the animation of TRON. However what separates it from the pack is it's live action. It's like one massive dance. A celebration of movement, like 100 ballets all at once. TRON elevates this art form to it's absolute highest levels using a perfect white canvas upon which positively astounding visuals are superimposed. TRON is the perfect mix of life and art.TRON is Alice in Wonderland. The TRON universe is a place which is so vastly different from our own and yet many rules are so similar. A place where just discovering things like how to live or even how to survive, eat, breathe, move and sleep can become a source of entertainment and challenge. It's a place where anything CAN happen, but rarely does. A place so taken for granted by everyone and everything involved in it but also so mysterious, unknown and undiscovered. A place so easy to imagine ourselves in or even wanting to escape to. This is the Electronic world of TRON. It's something I have not seen equalled in celluloid since this film's release in 1982. That includes the much more recent sequel TRON  Legacy.You may have heard it said that TRON is a religious film. Yet there are obviously no religions (as we know them) involved in it. TRON brings to the fore the value of life itself. Here we have an alternate universe filled with facsimiles (programs) of ourselves (the users). The programs view their user (or at least the collective of users) as their creator or god. They look to them for guidance, protection and an answer to that almighty question of why. The programs (just like us) know not of why they must do the things they do &#x96; but they follow the motions all the same, believing that us users really know what we're doing. They hope that one day it will all make sense to them.TRON deals with the struggle of life and calls into question the value of it. TRON programs are so easily dispensed with because they are not supposed to be living. The look of horror that fills the face of a of TRON character when they suddenly realise death is imminent and that they have failed in their task &#x96; it boils up an emotion within us that cannot be ignored. A disgust that life could be worth so little and that something so frivolous and pointless as losing a video game match could result in a precious, innocent and child like life being destroyed.It's interesting for me to remember waaaay back in 1982 overhearing a small group of young women discussing several films they had recently seen between each other. One of them had seen TRON, the other two had not but had seen trailers. Right away the one that had seen it, picked up on the tragedy that is TRON.Did you know that they really DIE when they die in those video games? That was really hard and disturbing to watch.Here was an ordinary (female!!) movie goer who had seen the film. Despite all the fuss about ground breaking animation, up to date graphics, amazing artwork and fantastic story lines the one thing that made an impression on her (and became the talking point with friends) was the tragic message that lies behind this amazing film.Yori's Love Scene.The biggest blunder in film history must surely have been the deletion of this completed scene from TRON. I have always wondered why in the '80s, about two thirds through watching the film I often used to get bored with it. More often than not I would stop the film around that point and come back to finish watching it later.Now I know why.The place that I would always seem to stop it was where this scene belonged. The scene was pivotal in telling the human tragedy within the story of TRON and helping to bring to life the characters. It was just 30 seconds of film. Yori's love scene would have introduced a completely new dimension to the film. It would have posed the question  just where do programs come from? If they can love each other.. if there can be such a thing as sexual activity between two TRON programs then what is the purpose? Can two programs create a new one? Who would that program's user be? Yori's love scene explores not only relationships between two living machines.. it goes on to explore the ultimate relationship between them. Cool concepts and questions posed that almost certainly would have woken up just about anybody watching at that crucial moment. It would have more than easily left ET looking very dull by comparison.Paul Matthews.

The look of horror that fills the face of a of TRON character when they suddenly realise death is imminent and that they have failed in their task &#x96; it boils up an emotion within us that cannot be ignored. A disgust that life could be worth so little and that something so frivolous and pointless as losing a video game match could result in a precious, innocent and child like life being destroyed.It's interesting for me to remember waaaay back in 1982 overhearing a small group of young women discussing several films they had recently seen between each other. One of them had seen TRON, the other two had not but had seen trailers. Right away the one that had seen it, picked up on the tragedy that is TRON.Did you know that they really DIE when they die in those video games? That was really hard and disturbing to watch.Here was an ordinary (female!!) movie goer who had seen the film. Despite all the fuss about ground breaking animation, up to date graphics, amazing artwork and fantastic story lines the one thing that made an impression on her (and became the talking point with friends) was the tragic message that lies behind this amazing film.Yori's Love Scene.The biggest blunder in film history must surely have been the deletion of this completed scene from TRON. I have always wondered why in the '80s, about two thirds through watching the film I often used to get bored with it. More often than not I would stop the film around that point and come back to finish watching it later.Now I know why.The place that I would always seem to stop it was where this scene belonged. The scene was pivotal in telling the human tragedy within the story of TRON and helping to bring to life the characters. It was just 30 seconds of film. Yori's love scene would have introduced a completely new dimension to the film. It would have posed the question  just where do programs come from? If they can love each other.. if there can be such a thing as sexual activity between two TRON programs then what is the purpose? Can two programs create a new one? Who would that program's user be? Yori's love scene explores not only relationships between two living machines.. it goes on to explore the ultimate relationship between them. Cool concepts and questions posed that almost certainly would have woken up just about anybody watching at that crucial moment. It would have more than easily left ET looking very dull by comparison.Paul Matthews.

All the character had for a well enough established origin was 'parents were murdered in a back alley' (the graphic novel 'Year One' only hit shelves like one year before the films release). So its no wonder why the Joker almost steals the entire film. Having said that Michael Keaton does make an excellent Bruce Wayne\/Batman depicting a man constantly in turmoil between identities. The plot line initially seems rather basic good vs evil. However after watching it time and time again it actually gets more intriguing. Particularly with how Joker rises to the top of Gotham's criminal empire to further his plot. If you want a Batman story thats still dark but more grittier then watch Nolan's interpretations.

The movie feels a bit cheap or sloppy, even, and yet there are moments when it shines and when you feel its depth and it's potential.And then there is Paul Newman. He's the lead throughout, the title character no doubt, and he gives an utterly convincing, nuanced, unflinching portrayal of a tough old guy in a small town. He isn't quite the lovable one that everyone loves despite his flaws--that would be too much of a cliché, and the movie avoids at least that one big cliché perfectly. With Newman's help. He's a bit too gruff and makes too many truly hurtful decisions to automatically make him a diamond in the rough, a sweetie with a leather exterior. But the viewer can see soon enough how genuine he is, thoroughly thoroughly genuine. He doesn't coddle, he doesn't waffle. He knows what he's about. And he really is admirable for steadily getting small things done for the good of others, though you can hardly tell sometimes. The fact that he ignores common decency (like driving his pickup truck on the sidewalk) is not quite charming, but it adds to his honesty, ironically.The rest of the cast sounds impressive but doesn't have nearly as much to do, not with any depth, though with sincerity in the performances. Bruce Willis has a role that constrains him more than you'd think, as a younger building contractor who is a bit of a rake. Jessica Tandy is a sharp, lovable older woman who rents to her upstairs to Newman. Melanie Griffith has a small role and is charming in her distinctive way, and we even see, briefly, Philip Seymour Hoffman in an unlikely role as the local cop.The director (and screenwriter) is Robert Benton, who is best known (to me) as the director (and writer) for Kramer vs. Kramer. I'm guessing it was because of that, and the kind of interpersonal story at stake, the allowed him to gather such an impressive cast. It would be a wild guess to understand why it doesn't quite work--my first inkling is merely that he was screen writing about someone else's original story and it was something he didn't know about first hand. Some of the lines are off, some of the humor gets silly, and in one or two cases you just want to say, no way.Even with the elevating humor to the tale you expect it to maintain its realism which it mostly does. It's set in the mid-Hudson Valley, where I've lived for 30 years, and there were lots of familiar places. They got the feel of the little towns slightly down on their luck really nicely, and the damp cold of winter adds to the overall ambiance. (There are directing quirks here, too, like never plowing the streets, and anyone who lives in an area with snow knows that the main streets, and even the smaller ones, get plowed often and well. But hey, it looks good, all that white.)What's to take away from this? A beautiful sense of integrity. The father-son dynamics are too forced to work, the seeming true friendships that exists or not between some characters isn't always fleshed out, and the weird relationship between Newman and Willis is crude and off-kilter. It's not a great film on many terms. But the development of Newman as a persona, as a type of person, is amazing. And he's amazing. Enough to see the movie just for his contribution.

Bruce Willis has a role that constrains him more than you'd think, as a younger building contractor who is a bit of a rake. Jessica Tandy is a sharp, lovable older woman who rents to her upstairs to Newman. Melanie Griffith has a small role and is charming in her distinctive way, and we even see, briefly, Philip Seymour Hoffman in an unlikely role as the local cop.The director (and screenwriter) is Robert Benton, who is best known (to me) as the director (and writer) for Kramer vs. Kramer.

The father-son dynamics are too forced to work, the seeming true friendships that exists or not between some characters isn't always fleshed out, and the weird relationship between Newman and Willis is crude and off-kilter.

The movie feels a bit cheap or sloppy, even, and yet there are moments when it shines and when you feel its depth and it's potential.And then there is Paul Newman. He's the lead throughout, the title character no doubt, and he gives an utterly convincing, nuanced, unflinching portrayal of a tough old guy in a small town. He isn't quite the lovable one that everyone loves despite his flaws--that would be too much of a cliché, and the movie avoids at least that one big cliché perfectly. With Newman's help. He's a bit too gruff and makes too many truly hurtful decisions to automatically make him a diamond in the rough, a sweetie with a leather exterior. But the viewer can see soon enough how genuine he is, thoroughly thoroughly genuine. He doesn't coddle, he doesn't waffle. He knows what he's about. And he really is admirable for steadily getting small things done for the good of others, though you can hardly tell sometimes.

This film is an under the radar 80's gem that I really enjoyed, because you never quite seen a film like it there really aren't that many that tackle the subject matter on dreams let alone really that many psychic suspense thrillers; this film was one of the first and one of the best examples in my book anyway. The plot is solid if not entirely unique, it's the typical conspiracy against the president plot that I've seen in dozens of suspense thrillers, but here their using the dream realm which I felt was a different spin on this plot and helps make it slightly interesting. The music in the film is good there are a few memorable tracks. The characters are solid, I like the protagonist Alex Gardner (Dennis Quaid) he's an expert psychic but a rookie in entering dreams. He's slightly arrogant but in a good way, has a little charisma, he's a bit sympathetic because he feels responsible for not saving his father despite the fact he only got the vision when he was a child, but he's willing to take the psychic hero gig whether he wants to or not because there's no one else. Kate Capshaw was good as Jane DeVries she was a good number two for Alex, whom is smart, slightly useful, can hold her own against danger. Both have decent chemistry together both platonic and romantic wise.And the antagonists I thought were good opponents. Christopher Plumber was decent, I don't have much to say for him since he's kinda a typical two dimensional head villain. But it's really David Patrick Kelly that stands out for the main villain, he has played villains before I thought was once again a good villain. He's basically an butt head psycho psychic for hire whom surprising turns out to be intimidating due to how well he utilizes the dream world, let alone a more experienced psychic which unfortunately gives him a slight advantage over Alex. He's also kinda funny from some of the charisma he delivers.But really were in this film for the Dreamscape sequences which are the highlight of the film and they don't disappoint, there something you just have to see to believe. It's true that there have been some TV episodes and movies that have utilizes dream sequences, but these dream sequences in this film still stand out because of how unique they are and how elaborate in detail and atmosphere.I really like how it's shot and certain effects and set pieces which successfully created a surreal landscape, and it felt accurate because that's basically what most of our dreams are they never really look or behave like our contemporary reality because anything could happen and does. Alex's reactions to them help because were in the same boat as him in the sequences, the Dreamscape is trippy, fascinating and even a little scary. One of the things that stand out no doubt is the Snake Man, I still think is a memorable monster. I really like the design of it, it sort of looks like Cobra Ka from He-Man. The way it just behaves and looks is creepy, and personally I find snakes at times creepy anyway.My favorite Dreamscape was in the final conflict, I just really like the post apocalyptic setting, but also just the back and forth in the physical (or psychic) confrontation between Alex and Tommy. I just like how Tommy is just throwing different things against Alex, like having a ninja uniform and using nunchkus; as well as other things I don't want to give away.It's true this films journey isn't without it's bumps. Certain scenes where Alex isn't in the Dreamscape weren't that interesting and useless, like the gambling scene. One dream scape journey to a divorced couple was out of place and look like something out of a bad soap.

So what's one more, right?First off, the movie is ridiculous.

At this point, what is not shown is just as important as what is shown. In stark black & white, luminous, eerie lighting reveals the bulbous contours of some vulgar alien thing clearly intended to represent death and science gone wrong, not children's show heroism. Its roar has never been more elemental, especially in the black opening credits sequence, when all you can do is imagine some face in the cyclopean depths to match the voice. It's not Godzilla Roar(tm) at this point, it's a guttural, haunted croak that makes your skin crawl. Meanwhile, the usually pleasantly consonant march theme used in most subsequent Godzilla films captures the mania of a city on the verge of destruction. There are all kinds of little touches that make Godzilla seem more animated than any CGI nowadays could accomplish; they swap models of the monster depending on scale to suggest an unfathomable proportion, its lips seem to twitch with hunger, and so forth.But there's a certain social realism to the film that reinforces the illusion as much as the effects. While later Godzilla movies carried over the use of the military as an excuse to give us more destruction, here we see how futile humans can be in a moment of crisis, bickering and politicking amongst each other pathetically. While it dates the film, the typically Japanese melodramatic acting does a lot to sell the sense of terror. In later giant monster movies, they're like oh, a fire breathing monster in destroying Tokyo? Must be Friday. Here, the image of a sobbing mother comforting her two children by telling them they'll meet their father soon is an unnerving one.I'm not putting down the sequels--I think there's a lot of value in a bad or totally misguided movie that's a lot of fun or allows anyone involved a lot of creativity, so I'll jump to the defense of some of the most no-plot, shambolic Godzilla films.

The problem I believe is from the fact that George Lucas had all the rights to wheel and drive this movie how he pleases, that with no one questioning him, this I believe is the reason I had to deal with 2 hours or less of Jar Jar Binks, who wasn't funny but annoying and his clan was so annoying that I wished the droids wiped them out before young Anakin Skywalker could save them.Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) were the high side of this movie, I was extremely impressed by the portrayal of Qui-Gon Jinn to the point that I just wanted to be seeing Liam Neeson at all times, he was just magnificent and made the movie worth seeing and his presence made it easier to deal with the annoying Character of Jar Jar Binks and his clan.Star Wars Episode 1 The Phantom Menace is the forth film in the Star Wars saga, it came about from Lucas planning a back story that will connect and give a story depth between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, in the first Star Wars trilogy Vader is said to be Luke's father so this second trilogy is to show how Anakin (Darth Vader) was trained and swayed to the dark side. The movie main protagonist will be Anakin Skywalker, and this first movie of the sequel will be his introduction.The name Phantom Menace depicts Palpatine hiding his true identity as the evil Sith Lord. The movie follows the adventure of Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi as they were to escort and protect the Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) of planet Naboo as she travels to Coruscant as she hopes to end the trade dispute between her people and the Viceroy. Their Journey wasn't a peaceful one as the Viceroy invaded Naboo and they had to flee. During their flight a breakdown of their space craft causing them to land in the planet Tatooine where they met young Anakin Skywalker and also witnessed the return of the Sith, as Qui-Gon Jinn had to defend himself from one.The CGI in the movie is not as impressive as I will expect and but the screenplay is one that will keep the interest of many, this massive box office hit was received with many mixed reviews and I myself have mixed feelings about the movie. It will be a lot easier to enjoy this movie if you have seen the first trilogy, don't try to watch the movie from here up hoping to get the feel.In conclusion, Star Wars is a wonderful franchise a movie plot that can go on and on, I did enjoy this movie but not because of the script or plot which were a 5\/10 from my view but because of the performance of Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor.www.lagsreviews.com ","genre":null},{"date":"2 February 2013","score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" To be honest the Phantom Menace, didn't bring about the introduction I desired about the whole Stars Wars saga, but it was a nice movie by its own rights.

KRAMER VS. KRAMER ended up winning five Oscars including Picture, Director, Screenplay as well as awards for both Hoffman and Streep and it's pretty hard to argue and say they didn't deserve it. I've always been very fond of this movie for its frankness on the subject and because of the terrific performances but watching it for the first time since having my own son it really gives one a better appreciation of the material. I say this because the first hour of the film is pretty much a fun movie about a father trying to handle both work as well as both sides of the family. I thought Hoffman was most effective because the screenplay let the character be something real and not just one of those fake characters that often turn up in lesser quality movies. The character is far from flawless as we see his many faults but the entire time you feel as if you're watching something real. The relationship between the father and son has some down moments but it's all just so realistic. I thought the final thirty-minutes once the Streep characters enters the picture again were incredibly depressing and this here is something that really hit home now that I'm older. What makes the film so memorable are the performances as Hoffman has never gotten the credit he deserves even though he has two Oscars. It seems he's often overlooked by DeNiro, Pacino, Nicholson and the other heavy hitters of this terrific group but Hoffman has always been so great in so many different type of roles. I thought the mental stress of the situation is what he really nailed and this is perfectly scene in the first morning that he takes over the role of mommy.

It's not your average crime movie, with the crazy shootings and car chases, but it's a movie that brings you close to every character, when in fact, you don't know anything about any of them.After a jewelry store robbery goes wrong, four of the men hired to do the job return to their safe house, trying to figure out who set them up. Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) brings a heavily wounded Mr. Orange (Tim Roth) to the safe house, trying to fix him up. Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) arrives just minutes later, and all three are then joined by Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) who brings a pleasant surprise. The movie avoids all the cliché bullshit, giving us a unique storyline and dialogue. It doesn't have all that unnecessary romantic subplot, nor any goofy scenes clumsily thrown in. Every moment of the film is a new idea, different than any other ideas used in movies at that time. It's a testament that less is more; the details of the failed robbery, which the entire movie is based on, are only conveyed in the dialogue, which attracts the watcher to every word said by the characters, and putting our imagination in motion so we can try to picture what happened.Being one of Tarantino's first directed movies, Reservoir Dogs is perfectly put together. The directing, the producing, the plot, and the acting were sublime. For a story line so straightforward, the actors had a real challenge to highlight what their characters are all about. But, surprisingly, every actor did his job just fine, giving us a great performance, making us believe that they were real criminals in a documentary. And to put up with the actors' brilliant performance, the production had to be at its best, and again, it did not disappoint. Not to forget Tarantino's famous signature, the trunk shot, which I think is really awesome.Some people may say that Reservoir Dogs is a little too violent, but the violence here is used to develop every character's personality, their disregard towards human life. Every character's own way of being violent shows the difference between him and the others. (Won't add anything to avoid spoilers)Reservoir Dogs is the kind of movie you can watch again and again without ever getting bored. Because, putting aside the brilliantly crafted Hollywood masterpiece, it's all about a message, making us think about the consequences of our actions. Reservoir Dogs will always be a Tarantino classic, and won't be forgotten by anybody who watches it.

OK, so, if this were a Die Hard sequel, it would be called Cry Hard. Hah-hah-hah-hah-ho-ho! Yes. Some words rhyme. Seeing this movie remains a rather scandalizing experience for me, because that was when I started to realize how shallow, predictable and ultimately identical most action blockbusters really are. (I had a similar epiphany about dramas when I saw Titanic--call it a Cameron thing, I guess.) So, right off the bat, I don't like how the survival\/horror angle of the first Terminator is replaced with balls-out action, minus a ball--half the time we get this X-treeeem 90s kid teaching Arnold to be human. What a load of cloying garbage, it's like Philip K. Dick for five year olds or something. Every major shootout, vehicle chase and heartstring-pulling moment is exactly where a room full of obnoxious people with stupid pants determined it should be. To counterbalance the bleeding-heart sappiness of it all, Cameron turns Linda Hamilton into a ridiculous butch caricature, because as we all know, in order to be independent and strong, women must exude meaningless aggression and generally act like cartoon survivalist cavemen. Like it or not, this is like the template for Independence Day, Transformers, you name it--loud, highly produced, obvious, accessible, but totally lacking substance, charm and danger. Why not just watch Hard Boiled or something?

There's nothing in this film that is worth appreciation. I have been teen once upon a time but I feel I surely would not have liked it even then. The teen in this movie seems to get away with anything and everything bad and the grown ups are shown as a bunch of idiots who can never catch him. His parents don't even get a hint of what he is up to!! The movie is a dark spot for parental\/kids relationship. I feel sorry for those who liked such a movie but I would never want my kids to see such a movie. I did not like anybody's acting either! If there was a lower rating than one (1) star for this I would have definitely gone for that.
