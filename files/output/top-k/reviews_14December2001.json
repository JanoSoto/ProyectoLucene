Piper Perabo is in a relationship with Jessica Pare.  The two of them have strong feelings for one another. Jessica leaves her for a guy.  Naturally, Piper doesn't take it well.  OK, I'm probably understating it when I say, not take it well.Aesthetically, the film is well-made.  I liked the use of lighting and shadows.  The one thing I have to criticize is the score.  I know this is a sad, melancholy story, but the music sounded like it was fished straight out an ultra-melodramatic after-school special.Of course, this story seems familiar.  Shy girl is new to school and she is befriended by a free-spirited troublemaker who sheds a whole new light on her boring existence.  But even a familiar premise can be made into something decent.Now here's my problem....the central character Paulie, played by Piper Perabo.  Basically, we're supposed to feel sympathy for her throughout most of the film.  She's been burned, we're supposed to yell Oh my God and burst into tears.  The problem is Paulie, though intelligent and free, is someone I couldn't care for.  And as the film went on, I felt less and less sympathy for her.  She has so much hate inside of her and inflicts it upon everyone she comes into contact with.  She goes completely hysterical, and throws tantrums left and right.  You just want to--well, I sure wanted to--scream out Get over it!  Besides--and this thought just came to me--the romance between Paulie and Torie (Jessica Pare) isn't developed to the point, where it goes beyond puppy love.  In watching the film, I had a good idea that Paulie and Torie were very good friends and loved each other, but I never got a sense of how deep their love was.  And even though, I think Paulie was being a complete drama queen.  I'm sorry, it's just I know drama queens like Paulie personally, and seeing her just conjures up bad memories.  And getting back to her hateful self, there is one scene where she drags Mouse (Mischa Barton) into the woods and makes her let out how much she hates her father.  And finally at the climax, we have a fencing match between Paulie and Torie's new boyfriend.  That's what this warm-hearted drama was missing  swordfighting!  I was actually cheering for the guy to win!Call me shallow, but I don't understand this whole idea the movie is trying to push  the love affair between the two central characters has nothing to do with lesbianism.  In one scene Piper actually cracks a mirror in hysterical rage and yells I am not a lesbian!  Maybe I read a different definition, but as far as I know when you like girls, you're attracted to girls romantically and sexually, you're a lesbian!  And there is actually an explicit sex scene between the two girls.  I know the movie doesn't focus on lesbianism as an issue, but the characters are lesbians--no need to be pretentious about it.Lost and Delirious is well-made and well-intentioned, but the execution is mediocre.  I just wanted to punch Piper out--and when I want to punch out such a beautiful woman like Piper, that's a big deal.  This is the woman we grew to love in Coyote Ugly and Rocky and Bullwinkle!  The film ends on a depressing note, only I wasn't depressed.  If only the movie had a more likable central character, it could've been so much better!My score  5 (out of 10)          ","genre":null},{"date":"14 December 2001","score":"7 out of 13 people found the following review useful","review":"  OK, now I get the point of the film.
