In the opening scene, upon waking up from being attacked, her mother mistakes her wounds to be that of a suicide attempt, and Kristen is sent to a mental hospital for young people located in Springwood, there she befriends the patients, Dr Gordon, and Nancy Thompson from the first film, the rest of the plot focuses on their struggle to survive and convincing the adults in the film that Freddy exists. For his directorial debut Chuck Russell does an amazing job, But this film in the series drifts away from the style that the first two films featured, instead of it being filled with suspense, it relies mostly on the amazing effects to shock the audience more so than scare them. Which in my opinion isn't really that much of a bad thing, the effects on their own might not terrify the audience, but they are handled in such a fantastic way that its still incredibly entertaining to see such amazing special effects. One aspect that is consisted with the first two films is the interesting characters, along with Kristen played by Patricia Arquette in her first film role, Dr Gordon played by Craig Wasson, Nancy Thompson returning from the first film, again played by Heather Langenkamp. What's interesting about most of these characters is the fact that even though this is a slasher film, the audience genuinely cares about them and they don't feel like cannon fodder that are only there so that they can be killed off in a creative way. Robert England delivers another great performance as Freddy Krueger, but with a lot more lines and screen time it feels distant from how we know him from the first two. Another aspect that it maintains is the amazing visuals, the production design is at its peak in this film, especially with the dream sequences. I don't have a lot of complaints about this film, the effects are great, the characters are good and the acting is good for the most part. My only complaints are that there is a bit of a lack of character devilment with a few of the characters, my other complaint is surprisingly Heather Langenkamp's performance, its good for the most part but with a few of her scenes, her performance comes across as a bit wooden and off. I was originally going to give this film a 6 out of 10, but when I watched it recently in preparation I realized its much better than I once thought, so I'm going to give A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 The Dream Warriors a 7.5 out of 10.

But what special effects it does have is still pretty good even by today's standards. Add in the music and performances of Judy Garland (as Dorothy), Ray Bolger (the Scarecrow), Bert Lahr (the Cowardly Lion), and Jack Haley (the Tin Man) and the end result is something that I don't believe can ever be duplicated.

The artist who is best known for his Oscar winning directorial venture - Gandhi (1982) is no more. An actor turned director, Richard Attenborough touched the sky of excellence in his making of Gandhi. This was the first English movie seen by me. While paying my tribute to the great filmmaker, I am reviewing that only.Gandhi starts from 24 years old Mohandaas Karamchand Gandhi's journey to South Africa in 1893 with a law degree in his possession. And then starts his quest for truth while sticking to his path of non-violence, together forming his great mantra of Satyagrah. After fighting against racial discrimination for 21 long years on the foreign land, he came back to his motherland to follow the same philosophy and strategy of his against the colonial rule in his own nation. After roaming about the nation on the advice of Goalkrishna Gokhle, he started his struggle from Champaran in 1917 and went ahead with the masses taking that beginning to the point of Quit India Movement in 1942 after which end of the colonial rule in India was just a matter of time. But the problem of mutual distrust and hatred between the communities was even bigger than the colonial rule which divided this great nation and swallowed lakhs of innocent lives including the one which was of Gandhi himself. \\ Richard Attenborough has done justice to his work and recreated history on the screen with near perfection. This sincere filmmaker devoted two decades in making of this epic movie and the end result proved to be an invaluable asset to the Indian cinema as well as the world cinema. He showed better sense by showing Gandhi's political journey only in his adulthood and skipped the events pertaining to his childhood. A movie is to be completed within a reasonable time frame and hence it was necessary to leave the initial phase of Gandhi's life.Flaws are there in the movie. Sardar Patel (Saeed Zaffrey) does not look the legendary Iron Man of India from any angle. Ditto for certain other characters alongwith ignoring certain significant historical events of that period. But these flaws cannot snatch the characteristic of being a great movie from Gandhi. Attenborough's in-depth research work and perfect casting of Ben Kingsley and Rohini Hattangadi for the lead roles of Gandhi and Kasturba contributed a lot to make it an unforgettable movie. Ben Kingsley is said to have slept on a small mat for a pretty long period in order to acclimatize him with the immortal character from the history of mankind. And when the movie was shot, he seemed to have created the soul of Gandhi in his earthly body. Lesser known Indian actress Rohini Hattangadi brought Kasturba alive on the screen.Attenborough extracted brilliant performances from almost all the cast members especially the Indian ones. No Hindi movie lover can forget Supriya Pathak as Manu and Neena Gupta as Abha in this movie. Making a realistic movie on that turbulent period of history while keeping Gandhi at the nucleus was by no means an easy task (and that's why two decades went into its making), so justice could not be done to certain historical characters. However the great filmmaker avoided trivial things which any formula-obsessed Indian filmmaker would not have been able to avoid viz. the affair of Acharya J.B. Kripalani as well as that of Sucheta and that of Indira and Feroze.By default perhaps, certain biases and contradictions in the great man's personality have been revealed though there's no bias in the filmmaker's approach either towards Gandhi or against Gandhi.The movie is an engaging one right from the word 'go' to its conclusion as John Briley has written the screenplay with sheer brilliance. The complete narrative moves forward speedily without a pause. The whole milieu is realistic and we seem to travel through that era getting a vision of India that was in the days of the British rule while watching this movie. All the action sequences render a feeling of realism. Technically, this is a flawless movie. Sitar maestro Pandit Ravi Shankar has prepared optimum music for this extra-ordinary movie I have seen both the English and the Hindi versions of this movie (on Doordarshan, of course) and found that anybody interested in history or the life of Gandhi can watch this umpteen number of times. It entertains as well as enlightens.As asserted in my review of the book My Experiments with Truth also, I feel sorry when I find people seeking pleasure in cursing Gandhi and enjoying the seemingly indecent talks about him (especially those related to his so-called experimentation in celibacy). You cannot understand Gandhi until you have at least a particle of himself in you. Attenborough had it, that's why he could understand what kind of a man M.K. Gandhi was.While paying my tribute to Richard Attenborough, I can't help remembering a dialog from this immortal piece of art of himself. When Gandhi was arrested at a point in the movie, the concerned police officer says to him, 'I am sorry Mr. Gandhi but you are under arrest' and Gandhi replies, 'I am not sorry'.

They accomplished more than that they made a film in which hardly any recognizably Earth-ish being can be detected. They did this by making creature creation a priority; story, dialogue, and the rest of the necessaries came later. The team's obsessive work to get the characters, the supporting animals, and even the background plants to look and move in a way that was feasible and consistent with the world paid off with a collection of the best and most diverse puppets ever to populate a motion picture. The large, bulky costumes with speaking roles, such as the bird-like baddies, the sloth-like goodies, and the beetle-like enforcers, are tapestries of fur, feathers, hair, leathery skin, and movement moving arms (sometimes four to a character), moving antennae, moving heads and mouths and beaks. It's quite a feat, and knowing that there is a person or persons crouching inside making all of that movement happen by contorting their bodies makes it all the more impressive.But this was always Henson's stock-in-trade as a puppet-maker and designer of elaborate costumes. The real breakthrough with Dark Crystal is in the extension of his passion for creature creation to the world at large. Kermit sat in a normal Earth swamp when he sang It's Not Easy Being Green, but the characters here trudge through undergrowth that is as alien and sentient as they are. A large trunk standing in water suddenly uproots itself and skitters up a hill. Nearby, an innocuous-seeming boulder claps shut, revealing that it was no boulder, but a rock-like creature with a huge mouth for catching unsuspecting prey. The adjacent fungus pods twitter in excitement. Later, creatures with four stilt-like legs run at speed on their way to a battle with the beetles in the most exciting action sequence of the movie.Speed, though, is something of a rarity within this approach to filmmaking. People wearing heavy and complicated costumes can only move so fast, and there is a lot of lumbering and sluggishness in the presentation of Dark Cyrstal that causes the mind to wander. The story does not do much to keep our attention; it was never Henson's priority, and it is as pat, predictable, and derivative as his creatures are fresh and innovative. The bland lead characters, called Gelfings, have a wooden feel in more ways than one. A power of theirs called dreamfasting adds a creative dimension, but their overall lack of depth makes it is easy to understand why a real human star was chosen for Henson's later, similar project, Labyrinth (1986). That film, though, is ultimately less ambitious than this one, which remains unique in its approach to world- building through puppetry.

It was largely due to part of the story that I won't go into (as there are some out there who didn't mind it and I won't spoil it for them). However, on the rare chance you don't know the story, it goes along the lines of a masked killer stalks and kills oversexed teens.And, in Part 5, we have more than the normal number of oversexed teens to do away with. There is certainly more of a diverse bunch to be sliced and diced. This is a nice (and new) touch to the franchise, however, it does take away from the story's central theme. It's one of the rare films in the saga to continue from the last one. The child survivor of Part 4 (Tommy Jarvis) is now grown up and still having problems dealing with his childhood trauma with the masked killer, Jason Voorhees. This is actually quite a nice idea, but is always a sub-plot as the film concentrates on killing so many of the cast, leaving little if any time to continue Tommy's tale.Once again, you can tell who's going to die and who's not. Let's face it... 'bad' people never last long in this sort of film (and Jason almost does the world a favour in getting rid of half the cast here!). Also, the death scenes are a little more imaginative and well thought out than in the predecessors.However, for all that's right with this film, fans still return to what's wrong with it.

He takes the role seriously, even though there is a glint of smugness in his eyes that he knows the role he's playing will give him screen immortality. Of course, there are four sides of Indiana-the college professor longing for life outside the classroom, the adventurer who is willing to go anywhere as long as he doesn't run into snakes, the romancer who always seems to end up with the wrong woman, and as we learned in The Last Crusade, the son of Sean Connery who always longed for something greater with his father and finally got it.This first edition rightly got a ton of Oscar Nominations, including Best Picture, and made a ton of money. Being one of the few Best Picture nominees to actually be a blockbuster, Raiders takes its viewers on a ride from which they will want to return again and again.

The special effects are outstanding and the score is so magnificent that it sounds even great in symphonies, such as the one I saw years ago at the Hollywood Bowl conducted by Mr. John Williams himself.

Scourupco's character is quite unique in that she has a decent level of screen time without Bond present, and she's also given important things to do rather than just looking pretty and helping out in quite minor ways, which is quite refreshing. Bean is great, and Janssen plays sadistic beauty very well. And although the movie was an update, it still subtlety looked back on both the series and on history in general.

Scourupco's character is quite unique in that she has a decent level of screen time without Bond present, and she's also given important things to do rather than just looking pretty and helping out in quite minor ways, which is quite refreshing. Bean is great, and Janssen plays sadistic beauty very well. And although the movie was an update, it still subtlety looked back on both the series and on history in general.

However, although this is a Stephen King film it isn't his usual horror stuff, this film takes place in the 1950's and is just a coming-of-age adventure film.The acting was great especially for child actors, the plot was interesting and it had both sad and funny moments, as well as some great nostalgic soundtrack.My one complaint? Well, I was a kid once, everyone was, and I've never heard kids swear as much as they do in this film, even when they're alone... maybe in the 50's swearing from kids was more common? That's just a minor thing though; overall this film was entertaining from start to finish. I can't say it was thrilling or suspenseful but it was pretty cool.

A housewife who is unhappy with her life befriends an old lady in a nursing home and is enthralled by the tales she tells of people she used to know. This is the kind of film that proves that a small story can be much more meaningful than a larger one. The only thing that keeps it afloat is the sensitivity of the relationships. I found the acting to be sensational, the dialogue incredible and the director's abilities to be up to par and then some. I really like this type of film, as it reminds me of French movies where it's more about the characters and their environment.

I like it enough, but I don't think it's great or all that really good. I will never understand the hate for this movie. Still haunted by his gruesome past, Tommy Jarvis - the boy who killed Jason Voorhees - wonders if somehow he is connected to brutal slayings occurring in and around the secluded halfway house where he now lives. This is a story about a place most people might not be able to conceive. Fortunately the director lets the actors breathe and the music lets the atmosphere live. In the end, the audience gets a casserole of film elements. My final rating is 7\/10. ( I am not saying the film is a classic, but it was pleasant.)

Brought to the island of Summerisle by an anonymous letter, Edward Woodward's constable is surprised to discover that the island's population suspiciously denies the missing girl's very existence. Even more shocking, at least to the traditionally pious law office, the island is ruled by a libertarian society organized around pagan rituals. Repelled by the open acceptance of sexuality, nature worship, and even witchcraft, the officer takes an antagonistic attitude towards the people and their leader, an eccentric but charming English lord (Christopher Lee). The officer's unease intensifies as he continues his investigation, slowly coming to fear that the girl's disappearance may be linked in a particularly horrifying manner to an upcoming public festival. Anthony Shaffer's meticulously crafted screenplay creates a thoroughly convincing alternative society, building tension through slow discovery and indirect suggestion and making the terrifying climax all the more effective. Performances are also perfectly tuned, with Woodward suitably priggish as the investigator and horror icon Lee delivering one of his most accomplished performances as Lord Summerisle. Little noticed during its original theatrical run due to studio edits and a limited release, the film's intelligence and uncanny tone has since attracted a devoted cult following.
