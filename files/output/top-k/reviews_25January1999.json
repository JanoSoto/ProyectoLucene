Shakespeare in Love is a comedy of mistakes about one gentleman in Verona (or, in this case, Elizabethan England) desperately trying to concoct Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter by the Twenty First Night.Shakespearean puns aside, Shakespeare in Love actually does center about a young William Shakespeare (Joseph Finnes), writing a play on assignment known as Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter, in a period of no less than three weeks.  However, he is making much bother about something the fact that William Shakespeare, one of history's most prolific playwrights, has writer's block.In former times, he was able to enjoy himself in adulterous fashion with everyone from the tired wives of Halifax to Othellina, the Mooress of Venice.  Not one of the eight wives of Henry VII can do a damn thing to complain about this lover.Now, however, he is Hamlet, serf of Sweden with his beloved Ophellia.  He has no inspiration, only angst.  He does not like it as it is. This is, however, until he finds himself smitten with Viola De Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow).  This temptress causes an emotional tempest.But, keeping with the pilgrim's passion, he lusts after a woman engaged (do I hear Prince Paris in the wings?), this time to Lord Wessex (played by Colin Firth, who lost another girlfriend to a Fiennes boy in The English Patient).  Lord Wessex comes across with all of the charm of Yiago, Othellina's trusted friend, but he does it in such a funny way that you have to love him.In fact, you have to love the entire movie.  The way that you see the evolution of Romeo and Ethel evolve into Romeo and Juliet while a similar play is being shown in their lives is a perfect postmodern device used before and equally well with Rozencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead, the highly satiric and intelligent play that launched Tom Stoppard onto the literary scene by telling the story of Hamlet from the view of the friends sent to spy upon him.Hey!  I went a paragraph without using a pun!  I'm going to my myself something from the merchant of Paris!The performances are worth writing sonnets about and put Caesar Augustus to shame, one of them already having earned a Golden Globe for Best Actress (Paltrow) and the movie is magical to watch.What is most interesting to watch, however, is the shrew taming that Stoppard demonstrates over his script.  Equally included are postmodern devices and plain old storytelling.   Grounding humor mixed in with things King Richard the First and Fourth could have been proud of, not to mention any of the Henrys.   Almost every line is tainted with Shakespearean reference.  So, when you see someone laughing their head off for almost no reason, let them there probably isn't an un-funny line in the script.In fact, there are equally many lines there for just anyone.  The way it opens has Geoffrey Rush bartering a deal with a loan shark to save his feet from coals.  It has funny quips like, when Shakespeare begins talking in iambic pentameter, Rush saying prose, please.The fact is that Shakespeare in love is incredibly funny, incredibly brilliant, incredibly beautiful.  It's exactly as I like it.  Next to Saving Private Ryan I would have to call it the best film of the year, and boy is it a close second.  Shakespeare buffs like myself will get all of the inside jokes, non-Shakespeare fans will be swept off their feet by the love story and by the humor that they'll get.  Everyone will enjoy, from Timon of the New York City Homeless Shelter to the King of Lears, Bill Gates.It doesn't even have an unhappy ending!

Most moviegoers have been trained by the Hollywood system to accept the three-act structure as gospel. Fortunately, there are a handful of filmmakers such as Malick who are talented enough to side-step this rule and rely on other, equally effective devices to power their films.2) The characters seemed to blend together - I never had a problem with recognizing every soldier as an individual. At times, putting the names to the faces was a challenge, but not a nuisance. It's important to keep in mind that often times we the viewer are meant to be a soldier on that tour of duty. Watch how the men look at us on the ship heading home at the end of the film. They are not looking into a camera lens. They are looking at a fellow soldier who's just had a shared experience.3) The film was better than\/worse than Saving Private Ryan - I don't understand why The Thin Red Line is constantly getting compared to Saving Private Ryan. I mean, you might as well compare it to every other war film out there, or perhaps just every other film in general. I guess because SPR is still fresh in everyone's memory (and a darling of the critics) that it is held up against TTRL. They are two completely different experiences (thank God for that).4) The Thin Red Line is a weak war film - Well, which war are you talking about? If you're talking about man's struggle to define himself within nature and the role he plays on this planet, then you'd be on the right track to the essence of this film. Granted, it doesn't take much talent and vision to show people being killed by grenades and bullets, but it does take a lot of insight to accurately portray the real war going on WITHIN the soldiers. And Malick successfully does just that.5) When the Japanese spoke, there were no subtitles - Again, WE are on that tour of duty. How many of those American soldiers could actually understand and speak Japanese? Do you get it now?6) John Travolta and George Clooney hardly get any screen time - Yeah, and you have a problem with that?!I could (should?) go on, but I won't. My quick review **** (out of ****). It's not exclusively about the taking of Guadalcanal, but more about the battle within each soldier as they fight over the thin red line between life and death.

This is not to say I loved this film or consider it to be the great masterpiece so many have over-hyped it to be. I happen to love historical epics and WWII is my favorite history subject along with the rarity of this type film these days makes it the more desirable for me to view. I do concur with all the rave about the opening beach landing being an intense awe-inspiring film experience however the remaining two plus hours of the film are quite ordinary and only the exciting battle at the conclusion of the film rescues SPR from being a dull disappointment. I also find the battle at the end of the film to be a contradiction to the opening battle and confuses the whole message.  In the first battle we are in the middle of massive carnage and gore and get the feel of being pinned down and what it's like to fear moving an inch and being killed but if you don't move you will be killed anyway! There is no false heroics only desperate men trying to stay alive and do their job. This better than any battle I've seen on film convinces me that I don't want any part of combat and there is nothing glorious about it and those that endured through it deserve our greatest admiration and respect which I believe is the primary message in the film.  The conclusion however resembles the rousing old adventure war films of the past.  Capt. Miller has found Ryan and has orders to bring him back to be sent home and this is his mission but instead he is talked into defending an important bridge by Ryan who doesn't want to abandon his comrades. We are then treated to an exhilarating battle that does not nearly match the terror and gore of the first and all the old W.W.II movie clichés start to show up. The rock hard sergeant who feels no pain no matter how many times he is shot, Ryan and his honorable loyalty to his men refusing to go home without having to risk his life any longer and of course the cavalry saving the day at the end when all appears lost !? I have a problem with films today dealing with war in that they go out of there way to try and convey too many messages as I believe there is a fear that its no longer politically correct or acceptable to make a war film for the sake of entertainment.  I do believe there have been some great war films with a message such as Paths Of Glory and Go Tell The Spartans and others but there have been far too many that try too hard to preach war is hell and so on and SPR is one of them. I'm not ashamed to say that I prefer films like The Longest Day and Where Eagles dare as they are more entertaining and far more successful at what they are trying to be. No film today tomorrow or a hundred years from now will ever convey the horror of war or will impact society's view of war alone.  Twenty years from now some other war film will come along and SPR will seem tame in comparison but it will still just be a movie like SPR is.   I went to see SPR for the action and my W.W.II interest and was compelled only by those two things not the weak story line or pretentious messages and syrupy drama. SPR is a good film because of two great action pieces that hold up the long message laden middle and if it wasn't for the cliched conclusion and Ryan simply returned to the rear this film would not be seen by as many people who would have been disappointed by a anti-climactic non action conclusion which is the primary reason people view war films to see combat action not be preached at about how horrible war is !

Now, in the Neo-Tokyo of the future, the youngest and lowliest of the gang, Tetsuo, ends up harnessing this extremely destructive power and goes on a rampage of telepathic mayhem to earn the fear of those who once bullied him relentlessly.  Beneath the violence in this movie lies the very touching story of this young man and his reconciliation with Keneda, his best friend.One of the most moving scenes in the film is a flashback that shows the first meeting between the two when they were very young.  Though the other kids had bullied and harassed Tetsuo, Keneda was there to stick up for his now lifelong friend.  If those who watch Akira can discard their preconceived notions of what animation should be, they will find one of the most exciting, emotional, and rewarding films they will ever have the fortune of seeing.As a special side note, I personally prefer the dubbed version, which is executed very well by a talented cast of voice actors. My favorite line in the movie belonged to the Colonel They don't teach tact at the academy.

Beneath the violence in this movie lies the very touching story of this young man and his reconciliation with Keneda, his best friend.One of the most moving scenes in the film is a flashback that shows the first meeting between the two when they were very young.  Though the other kids had bullied and harassed Tetsuo, Keneda was there to stick up for his now lifelong friend.  If those who watch Akira can discard their preconceived notions of what animation should be, they will find one of the most exciting, emotional, and rewarding films they will ever have the fortune of seeing.As a special side note, I personally prefer the dubbed version, which is executed very well by a talented cast of voice actors. My favorite line in the movie belonged to the Colonel They don't teach tact at the academy.

Devlin and Emmerich have a serious identity problem. It all started with the fist Godzilla trailer. That was an extremely clear way to say Spielberg´s T-rex is nothing compared to our Godzilla Oh! Were they wrong! For starters, why try to crush Spielberg by using a lot of elements from his movies? They started using a kind of publicity that Spielberg made popular (In which they didn´t show the complete monster, but only parts of it). Did Spielberg showed the shark on the Jaws trailer? Or a dinosaur on the Jurassic Park ones? Did he let us see E.T. or the Gremlins on the movie trailers? NO! But those were original and surprising creatures to look at for the first time. Godzilla shows up on its entirety after forty minutes, or so, of film. Now, one condition Spielberg proposed for him to accept the directing task on Jaws, was that the shark would not appear until an hour after the film had started. But Spielberg´s monster was scary, because it looked real, and acted like an animal...no conscience, no remorse. When I saw Godzilla for the first time, a mix between Aliens and Gremlins came to my mind, and because of that, it wasn´t much of a surprise. I had waited a whole year to see that unoriginal design? The babies were so raptors look-alike that they didn´t scare me at all. Patrick Tatopoulos, the Production Designer, should stop watching Spielberg movies too. My question is What happened to the Patrick Tatopoulos that made the excellent design for Alex Proyas´ Dark City? The movie would´ve survived if Devlin and Emmerich had included more logic sequences and less humor. The obligatory love scene, was so obligatory, I felt pushed into it. The three attacks on the city were great. What I can´t understand is, if Godzilla can catch a helicopter, why can´t it catch a New York City taxi cab? If it wants to destroy a car that´s hiding on a tunnel, why try to grab it, if it can burn it with its atomic breath? A submarine in New York´s East River? Is it really that deep? There are a lot of sequences that remembered me of memorable movie scenes When the boats are pulled underwater...Jaws The babies sequence is a bad copy of Jurassic Park´s raptor scene. Godzilla swimming on the East River? It was like seeing the underwater sequences of Alien Resurrection, all over again. Godzilla´s heartbeat...King Kong. But worst of all...Did the buildings being destroyed by the U.S Army reminded you of something? Yes! Devlin and Emmerich´s own ID4! On ID4, I called the resemblance with other movies (Star Wars, Planet of the Apes, War of the Worlds)an homage. In Godzilla it´s a clear lack of creativity. One last thing...(or two)What a cheap trick to hide a bad FX by covering it with rain and darkness. Spielberg allowed us to see his dinosaurs on broad daylight. I can easily say that Devlin and Emmerich have become public enemies to movie fans. They thought that after the box-office succes of ID4they could give us anything and we would buy it. Guess what! We´re no fools! Even sci-fi movies have to have a little logic... And I´m not asking for Shakespearean lines, just decent ones... Better start counting Try to stop me It looks angry We better run I think that´s a good idea You don´t even think those things, you automatically start running.

I think now we can say that also includes STEPMOMS (and dads)!!!   ","genre":"Comedy, Drama"}]
