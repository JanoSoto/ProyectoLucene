Forget watching LITTLE VOICE or some other film like that at the cinema, you don't lose anything when you see it on TV. When watching these kind of special effect epics, you simply have to be at the cinema. And I was. Myself and a friend had a choice between this, the PSYCHO remake, LITTLE VOICE or MEET JOE BLACK. And I'm glad we picked this one, as none of the others are as entertaining as this one was.For a start it's an adult tale, so expect gritty realism (bones breaking, frequent swearing, etc.) and Snipes gave us some actual insight into his role as the vampire hunter, instead of being another po-faced action hero. Here he is, torn between his human and vampire instincts. So I was impressed with his skills here. The other nod goes to Kris Kristofferson (FIRE DOWN BELOW), who plays an old, limping mercenary with great skill. Aside from a Udo Kier cameo, the rest of the cast is full of fresh, unfamiliar but unblemished faces we are used to seeing in DAWSON'S CREEK and the rest of those boring American TV shows. Stephen Dorff is Frost, the big baddie vampire of them all. He's not much of an actor, but he remains suitably evil.The film has many artistic scenes of blood dripping, guns dropping, all in slow motion as if they mean something. It certainly looks impressive, even if deep down it all means nothing apart from holding the audience's interest. Indeed this film is shallow, but it's so enjoyable that doesn't matter. The special effects are, predictably, the main star of the show, and they're in abundance. My record for most deaths in a film seen in the cinema was previously STARSHIP TROOPERS but this one overtakes it by miles. We've got impalings, decapitations, shootings, cuttings, burnings, meltings and even explodings (probably the most disgusting effect here). The audience was wincing and going oh my God at some of these effects so they obviously did work. Some of the effects look a bit computerised for my liking (especially the gargoyle-skeleton things which look like they were a cheap effect from an episode of XENA WARRIOR PRINCESS). As the film is an action-horror flick, there are also a lot of fight scenes, and these are handled with such ferocity, skill and speed that they cannot fail to impress. Blade fights loads of vampires off at a time, getting punched and beaten but always fighting back.The film also has a lot of interesting ideas about vampirism, and we learn about their society. Along with that is scientific analysis of the vampire virus, familiars who are the vampire's slaves and many other concepts. When the long-awaited SFX climax arrives it is slightly disappointing, but entertaining nonetheless. Blood literally burst on to our screens. There were a lot of references to other films (RETURN OF THE JEDI and THE SATANIC RITES OF Dracula to name but two) and a lot of the film was clichéd, but it was fun cliché. However the violence is numbing and excessive so it's not for the weak of heart. If you're an action fan, then it's probably worth your seeing.

It boggles the mind and defies comprehension to consider the sort of niggling, whining, nagging, crabbed sort of critic that could, somehow and beyond all belief, manage to find serious error, or in fact any error, in this outstanding and beautiful film, shot on location in Paris with many scenes filmed in the palace of Versailles. One has to wonder if this movie doesn't do it for them---what sort of film it is that appeals to this class of critic? Perhaps if the movie had included a few car explosions it might have pleased better these silly persons. The film chronicles the years 1784-89, when Jefferson served as Minister to the Parisian royal court for the fledgling US Congress; that is, in the period before and during the passage of the United States federal constitution, Jefferson being by then a world-renowned political celebrity. This is a historical drama of pitched and immense interest, presenting with great skill and art the sad and terrible racial politics of colonial America as presented through the fascinating personage of Thomas Jefferson, and his entourage of slaves---slaves now (temporarily) liberated in the environs of pre-revolutionary Paris. Conflicts ensue between Jefferson as Slave Master and his slaves, as the inevitable return to Monticello Plantation, which figures here almost as powerfully as it did for Jefferson himself, looms always ahead. Nick Nolte, an inspired if perhaps controversial and unexpected choice for the difficult role, portrays Jefferson's genius, complexities and faults with a fine and austere dignity and grace. The outstanding cast includes James Earl Jones; a young Gwyneth Paltrow as Jefferson's conflicted daughter Patsy; and a young Thandie Newton as Jefferson's paramour-slave-concubine Sally Hemings. With the imperial Court of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette as background, and featuring the Marquis de Lafayette, Dr Joseph-Ignace Guillotine, Jefferson's beautiful Parisian lover Maria Cosway, and the brewing Terror of the French Revolution, this film is a true and unique, classy feast for the eyes and mind---for viewers of elevated taste and learning only; cretins and historical ignoramuses should seek their entertainment elsewhere.

If we're simply talking about Disney heroines, that might be Jasmine from Aladdin or Esmeralda from The Hunchback of Notre Dame, but Mulan is far more than a simple heroine. She's the hero of her story. She is the one that causes things to happen. Sure, there have been lots of female protagonists before her, but in their case it was always the case of things happening to them and them reacting to it. Mulan's story is entirely her own doing. She didn't need to go to war for her dad. She chose to, despite all the problems it would bring her. It's a small distinction, but an important one.Furthermore, it's an amazing film even without our badass name-taking, sword-swinging, Hun-defeating, pole-climbing, ancient-bazooka-wielding hero. After a couple of rather flawed Renaissance films, it returns to form with all aspects of the film working beautifully together and with no discernible faults. Sure, some people claim that Shan Yu, the villain, is a tad boring and one-dimensional. And yeah, I can see where they're coming from, but personally I like him. He's menacing and unstoppable, with an intellect to match. He attacks China because it's there, no other reason needed. Having him singing villain songs would water him down.Then there's of course Mushu, the dragon guardian, voiced by Eddie Murphy. And yeah, that is an odd, odd casting choice, which I'm not one hundred percent convinced works. Sure, he is the best source of comedy in the film by far and it's very good comedy. One of Murphy's best roles, in fact. But he is also pretty distracting from time to time, keeping us from fully immersing ourselves. It doesn't really ruin the film, and I'm not convinced that a more traditional voice would have worked any better either, but it is a thing to ponder about.The songs are also great, though perhaps not Disney's best effort either. Though, keeping in mind that this is Disney, that's a pretty high bar to reach, so you cannot really fault the movie for failing. And they are good songs, with I'll Make a Man Out of You being a contender for that elusive best effort status.I love that this movie exists. That Fa Mulan as a character exists. That there is a movie that uncompromisingly tells us an adventure story with a female hero, in this age where we still cannot get any movies with female leads, unless they're romantic comedies or dramas about the difficulties of love. That's thankfully slowly changing and this movie will be remembered as an important milestone on that journey.

Yes, most films made thirty years ago or further back in the river of time could never be made today- though I have to say it would be hilarious to see the uproar if they released a Bond film with 60s gender politics today- but this film especially sticks out. It got out with a PG rating. Think about that for a second. Pixar movies get PG ratings nowadays. Even if this film went uber-light on everything- which I can tell you it doesn't- it would earn a hard PG-13 on subject matter alone. I don't doubt that it would get an R if it were released today, and even then, some things would likely need to be changed.Now, whether it should be rated R is another matter all together (I don't think I need to argue that some things would need to be changed for a release today either way). If a film like Mockingjay Part 2, one of the tonally bleakest movies I have ever seen in my life, can get out with a PG-13, then a film that drops a slurs and gives a few shots of breasts should definitely not get an R. But I'm getting off-track, aren't I? This film is, at its core, about a sixteen-year-old girl named Sam. It is her birthday, but everyone has forgotten it, as her older sister is getting married. She sneaks off to a party and tries to get the popular boy she has a crush on to notice her. Following her around is a sleazy freshman who plays like he's about ten times bigger than he really is. Hijinks abound.I should really show this movie to a bunch of politically-motivated SJWs just to get a rise out of them. The thing that sticks out the most is how casually and pleasantly they throw around the idea of rape, but there are many more. I should write an article where I pretend to be so offended and list out all the 'terrible offenses' this film makes.Yes, I do agree that a lot of these things shouldn't be in a film like this today and were frankly shocking to see so callously tossed around. But I also say that anyone who cannot see this as a product of its time is missing out on a fine film.If anything, the moral dissonance makes the film more interesting. This is just my opinion, and you don't agree so be it. But hear me out. Characters that are supposed to be near-entirely sympathetic become more gray, adding layer and texture to the film. It becomes a fundamentally more interesting film than it was back then, just like how every period of history is far more interesting after it's over.But then again, this film doesn't really need help to be interesting. Molly Ringwald as Sam (does it say something about how much I've watched The Breakfast Club that I want to keep writing 'Claire'?) delivers a well-rounded and interesting performance, and the rest of the cast makes sure not to let her down. Anthony Michael Hall is particularly energetic as the pervy freshman.What separates this film from its contemporaries and even from the other teen films of today is the weight it gives to the characters and subject matter. No, it does not slow down to an Oscary movie pace and slowly angst over all that's happening (for the better); and yes, the insensitive aspects of it do let the air out of that sentence, but there is no doubt that Hughes' gift for getting inside the mind of the teenager and pulling out some smart, thoughtful material is alive and well.People can say what people can say, but this film should be seen be everyone at least once. I don't think many other films represented the state of Americana in the eighties, both for better and for worse, as much as this one.And yes, unless you have a heart of stone, you will laugh at least a few times. Embrace this film and the blood, sweat, and tears put into it; I don't think there is any other way to view good art.

","genre":"Comedy, Romance"},{"date":"24 November 2015","score":"","review":" The first thing that stood out in my head when I watched this film is how it could never be made today. Yes, most films made thirty years ago or further back in the river of time could never be made today- though I have to say it would be hilarious to see the uproar if they released a Bond film with 60s gender politics today- but this film especially sticks out. It got out with a PG rating. Think about that for a second. Pixar movies get PG ratings nowadays. Even if this film went uber-light on everything- which I can tell you it doesn't- it would earn a hard PG-13 on subject matter alone. I don't doubt that it would get an R if it were released today, and even then, some things would likely need to be changed.Now, whether it should be rated R is another matter all together (I don't think I need to argue that some things would need to be changed for a release today either way). If a film like Mockingjay Part 2, one of the tonally bleakest movies I have ever seen in my life, can get out with a PG-13, then a film that drops a slurs and gives a few shots of breasts should definitely not get an R. But I'm getting off-track, aren't I? This film is, at its core, about a sixteen-year-old girl named Sam. It is her birthday, but everyone has forgotten it, as her older sister is getting married. She sneaks off to a party and tries to get the popular boy she has a crush on to notice her. Following her around is a sleazy freshman who plays like he's about ten times bigger than he really is. Hijinks abound.I should really show this movie to a bunch of politically-motivated SJWs just to get a rise out of them. The thing that sticks out the most is how casually and pleasantly they throw around the idea of rape, but there are many more. I should write an article where I pretend to be so offended and list out all the 'terrible offenses' this film makes.Yes, I do agree that a lot of these things shouldn't be in a film like this today and were frankly shocking to see so callously tossed around. But I also say that anyone who cannot see this as a product of its time is missing out on a fine film.If anything, the moral dissonance makes the film more interesting. This is just my opinion, and you don't agree so be it. But hear me out. Characters that are supposed to be near-entirely sympathetic become more gray, adding layer and texture to the film. It becomes a fundamentally more interesting film than it was back then, just like how every period of history is far more interesting after it's over.But then again, this film doesn't really need help to be interesting. Molly Ringwald as Sam (does it say something about how much I've watched The Breakfast Club that I want to keep writing 'Claire'?) delivers a well-rounded and interesting performance, and the rest of the cast makes sure not to let her down. Anthony Michael Hall is particularly energetic as the pervy freshman.What separates this film from its contemporaries and even from the other teen films of today is the weight it gives to the characters and subject matter. No, it does not slow down to an Oscary movie pace and slowly angst over all that's happening (for the better); and yes, the insensitive aspects of it do let the air out of that sentence, but there is no doubt that Hughes' gift for getting inside the mind of the teenager and pulling out some smart, thoughtful material is alive and well.People can say what people can say, but this film should be seen be everyone at least once. I don't think many other films represented the state of Americana in the eighties, both for better and for worse, as much as this one.And yes, unless you have a heart of stone, you will laugh at least a few times. Embrace this film and the blood, sweat, and tears put into it; I don't think there is any other way to view good art.

I know this movie was threatened to not be completed when she died suddenly in the middle of production. While sad, the movie was bigger than her small but pivotal role.

His character's arc could be seen the moment he said trust me. Sure. He's done the same slick and sinister character since 3 Days of the Condor and it never got any better. It just got old. Using ANYBODY else would have at least given us a sense of suspense. In this case, it was more like here we go again....

They can come back to bite you.And whomever cast the slimy Andy Warhol-lookalike as the sneaky traitor to the project should be positively fired on the spot. If the character is unbelievable the moment he shows up on screen, there's no way another SMART (i.e. Louise Fletcher) character would ever trust the guy. Someone with no talent should never, ever translate into MORE screen time. He was supposed to be some kind of genius that robbed people of their creations? The guy couldn't even quote his lines properly let alone be crafty enough to steal someone's life's work. The moment that guy showed up, the movie ended being interesting and became just another screw 'em so they can fight back movie. And the son was literally not needed at all.

Such a perception was virtually rendered idiotic when The Fellowship of the Ring was released to cinemas in 2001, garnering the respect of both critics and fans alike. To this day, it seems the near perfect adaptation of a novel to a film. Frodo Baggins is tasked with setting out to destroy The One Ring, a weapon forged by Sauron during the Second Age of Middle Earth. He is accompanied by eight other companions, into a company known as The Fellowship of the Ring, to go to Mt. Doom to destroy this all powerful weapon. Jackson's abilities as a filmmaker were not too well tested prior to this near impossible project, so for New Line Cinemas to give Peter Jackson the rights to Tolkien Estate can be considered foolish. How can a director, with only two noteworthy credits in Heavenly Creatures and The Frighteners exceed such a reputation to bring forth J.R.R Tolkien's vision to life? Yet, what Peter Jackson managed to do with cast and crew, is now an inspiration. For The Lord of the Rings to work as an adaptation, the casting must be near perfect. The world is foreign to many viewers, the characters often are not human characters (though they obviously possess human traits) so the cast must be able to evoke a sense of humanity into them. Elijah Wood is wonderful as Frodo, conveying a sense of naivety but also a sense of extreme courage and determination. Sir Ian McKellen is phenomenal as Gandalf, calm and reassuring at all times, but also very kind and caring towards Frodo especially. Viggo Mortensen captures Aragorn seamlessly, his struggles with dealing with a failed bloodline and his desires to escape his duty to his people. Then there is Sean Bean, whose portrayal of Boromir is stunning. The only member of the Fellowship to be killed (and not resurrected), Boromir's presence is ever lasting during the trilogy. Virtually a broken warrior, mostly due to his father's extreme demands and the declining of Gondor as a kingdom. Sean Bean, in many scenes, perfectly captures the moral complexities the character faces. We see in his conversations with Aragorn that he desires to do good for his people, but brings himself to do it in an immoral manner. We see during the course of the film that he is further broken down in spirit, culminating in a moment where he attempts to seize the Ring by force from Frodo. Almost immediately realizing his mistake, he gives life for Merry and Pippin. He is forgiven for his wrongdoings by Aragorn, who then promises the longevity of their people. The redemption of Boromir also enforces into Aragorn a necessary responsibility he must begin to accept he is heir to the throne of Gondor. When reading through the first two volumes of J.R.R Tolkien's Lord of the Rings novel, there are moments throughout that feel utterly unnecessary. The major event being the hobbits meeting Tom Bombadil as the Nazgul chase the hobbits. This event constitutes an entire chapter, and in the process, diminishes from the suspense and momentum that had been established. Peter Jackson, realizing the event has little significance on the overall plot, omitted this, to the indignation of most fans of the novel. Peter Jackson, alongside Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens, wrote a near perfect script that wonderfully represents the nature of the book. One of the fine little touches, that fans have enjoyed, is the quick set of events that occur after the hobbits leave town, such as concerning hobbits or a shortcut to mushrooms - chapters from Tolkien's novel are tightly condensed and converted into a cinematic medium through which they can be accessed. The cinematography to this series of films can be described as swooping, breathtaking and majestic. And it certainly is. But it also provides a means to an experience. Why many fans of the series find it an experience is due to the cinematography, as the camera is rarely static but always in motion. Contrasting this with the prequels to Lucas' Star Wars, the camera is fixed and the actors are given limited space through which to act. Those films feel like a mental prison, the viewer is stuck under the confines the characters are stuck and cannot escape. Of course, this notion applies very differently when considering films like The Shawshank Redemption but for fantasy\/sci-fi adventures such as Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings, the cinematography must be enriching. It provides an experience, rather than just a mere film. Starting with The Fellowship of the Ring, this series of films is certainly an experience. The Fellowship of the Ring remains a defining achievement in modern cinema, it re-invented and redefined the meaning of a blockbuster and has paved the way for countless fantasy films. Arguably the greatest of its genre, The Fellowship of the Ring deserves every ounce of respect it gets. It is one of a rare kind of films that is so perfect in every aspect, from music to acting, from direction to cinematography, from editing to sound design, that to refute its importance to cinema is foolish. Peter Jackson did the seemingly impossible task of adapting one of the great pieces of literature into one of the great pieces of cinema.

Frodo Baggins is tasked with setting out to destroy The One Ring, a weapon forged by Sauron during the Second Age of Middle Earth. He is accompanied by eight other companions, into a company known as The Fellowship of the Ring, to go to Mt. Doom to destroy this all powerful weapon. Jackson's abilities as a filmmaker were not too well tested prior to this near impossible project, so for New Line Cinemas to give Peter Jackson the rights to Tolkien Estate can be considered foolish. How can a director, with only two noteworthy credits in Heavenly Creatures and The Frighteners exceed such a reputation to bring forth J.R.R Tolkien's vision to life? Yet, what Peter Jackson managed to do with cast and crew, is now an inspiration. For The Lord of the Rings to work as an adaptation, the casting must be near perfect. The world is foreign to many viewers, the characters often are not human characters (though they obviously possess human traits) so the cast must be able to evoke a sense of humanity into them. Elijah Wood is wonderful as Frodo, conveying a sense of naivety but also a sense of extreme courage and determination. Sir Ian McKellen is phenomenal as Gandalf, calm and reassuring at all times, but also very kind and caring towards Frodo especially. Viggo Mortensen captures Aragorn seamlessly, his struggles with dealing with a failed bloodline and his desires to escape his duty to his people. Then there is Sean Bean, whose portrayal of Boromir is stunning. The only member of the Fellowship to be killed (and not resurrected), Boromir's presence is ever lasting during the trilogy. Virtually a broken warrior, mostly due to his father's extreme demands and the declining of Gondor as a kingdom. Sean Bean, in many scenes, perfectly captures the moral complexities the character faces. We see in his conversations with Aragorn that he desires to do good for his people, but brings himself to do it in an immoral manner. We see during the course of the film that he is further broken down in spirit, culminating in a moment where he attempts to seize the Ring by force from Frodo. Almost immediately realizing his mistake, he gives life for Merry and Pippin. He is forgiven for his wrongdoings by Aragorn, who then promises the longevity of their people. The redemption of Boromir also enforces into Aragorn a necessary responsibility he must begin to accept he is heir to the throne of Gondor. When reading through the first two volumes of J.R.R Tolkien's Lord of the Rings novel, there are moments throughout that feel utterly unnecessary. The major event being the hobbits meeting Tom Bombadil as the Nazgul chase the hobbits. This event constitutes an entire chapter, and in the process, diminishes from the suspense and momentum that had been established. Peter Jackson, realizing the event has little significance on the overall plot, omitted this, to the indignation of most fans of the novel. Peter Jackson, alongside Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens, wrote a near perfect script that wonderfully represents the nature of the book. One of the fine little touches, that fans have enjoyed, is the quick set of events that occur after the hobbits leave town, such as concerning hobbits or a shortcut to mushrooms - chapters from Tolkien's novel are tightly condensed and converted into a cinematic medium through which they can be accessed. The cinematography to this series of films can be described as swooping, breathtaking and majestic. And it certainly is. But it also provides a means to an experience. Why many fans of the series find it an experience is due to the cinematography, as the camera is rarely static but always in motion. Contrasting this with the prequels to Lucas' Star Wars, the camera is fixed and the actors are given limited space through which to act. Those films feel like a mental prison, the viewer is stuck under the confines the characters are stuck and cannot escape. Of course, this notion applies very differently when considering films like The Shawshank Redemption but for fantasy\/sci-fi adventures such as Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings, the cinematography must be enriching. It provides an experience, rather than just a mere film. Starting with The Fellowship of the Ring, this series of films is certainly an experience. The Fellowship of the Ring remains a defining achievement in modern cinema, it re-invented and redefined the meaning of a blockbuster and has paved the way for countless fantasy films. Arguably the greatest of its genre, The Fellowship of the Ring deserves every ounce of respect it gets. It is one of a rare kind of films that is so perfect in every aspect, from music to acting, from direction to cinematography, from editing to sound design, that to refute its importance to cinema is foolish.

The film concerns a young man named Eddie, played by Mark Wahlberg, who has dropped out of high school and is making ends meet working as a busboy at a nightclub and living with his parents. One day on the job, he catches the eye of Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds), a renowned porn director during the industry's Golden Age, who admires his natural attractiveness and invites him to come spend time with him at his enormous ranch. Numerous people live under Jack's roof, including a young starlet named Rollergirl (Heather Graham), nicknamed because of her obsession with her rollerblades, Maggie (Julianne Moore), an older porn actress famous for a long-running series of films, Buck (Don Cheadle), a struggling stereo salesman, and Reed (John C. Reilly), a squirrelly man who seems to just live off of Jack's dime. Upon running away from home, Eddie soon becomes Dirk Diggler, one of the industry's most famous and acclaimed porn stars almost overnight; he is glitzed with awards, recognition, and more money than he could ever spend, but slowly allows his masculinity and fragile ego to command him as a person. Such concepts heavily adhere to feminist film writer Laura Mulvey's ideas of phallocentrism and the male gaze. With that, Boogie Nights handles male and female characters quite differently, giving the male characters an inferiority complex that makes them define their worth based on their own personal work, and the two main female characters in the film dichotomous roles, one to showcase attractiveness and the other to showcase the lack thereof.The pornographic industry has always been under fire for its treatment and sexualized depictions of women. Paul Thomas Anderson immediately dismantles that assertion by giving it some equality; in porn, everyone, regardless of race or gender, is a sex object, though most pay to see said films to have their eyes locked on the females in the film. Consider the fact that in Boogie Nights, Rollergirl, while having a name, which you may have missed, lacks a character. Her mysteriousness is part of her aura and that's the attraction in porn, Anderson subtly implies. Because we don't know much about Rollergirl as a character, we, the audience, can appreciate her for her flesh and ability to have sex because we can't look beneath the surface at her character. Her flat characterization, while devaluing her as a person, essentially makes her successful at what she is trying to convey; an empty vessel capable of great sex many men of varying different ages can only dream about. Had we learned about Rollergirl as a person &#x96; maybe she had a troubled childhood, did poorly in school, or simply doesn't have a strong and sustainable relationship with her family &#x96; she would've become less attractive because she would've had more baggage, and that's not the kind of pleasure we pay to see or hear when we watch pornography.

Director Ridley Scott really outdone himself with this enthralling epic, shining more effort and incredible direction from his 'Alien' franchise. Scott polishes this film with a captivating story and masterful script that fuels with film from to start. Opening with an intense and harrowing battle scene between the Roman army and the Greek army that leads to countless bloodshed, the Gladiator boasts a story with such depth and energy, and uses some powerful characters like the main antagonist who is brought to life by the tour-de-force performance by Joaquin Phoenix.

Russell Crowe also grabs the spotlight with his performance as the main character Maximus. While the film may not have the power to fill in for its occasionally humdrum pacing, it fuels its plot with some great writing and strives a strong narrative that audiences will not be given much of a choice than to sit through it.Gladiator is arguably Ridley Scott's best picture and one of the best historical epics put on screen. Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix are both outstanding in this film and deserve a round of applause. This is a film is worth watching for most, but those who are sensitive to graphic and bloody combat may want to stay away from this one.

It makes me wish I was a better poet so I could do it justice with words. It is the reason why man makes pictures with colours. I could take any single frame, especially any single background, hang it on my wall and be perfectly happy with it. It's&#x85; beautiful beyond words, beyond my ability to express it properly.It's also the end of an era. The last film of the Disney Renaissance. There are still good Disney films to come, but never again have we had such a streak of quality, of ambition and willingness to push the limits of what you can do with animation. And as far as I'm concerned, they could have done a lot worse than this film as a swan song. They took a relatively simple, yet classic book by Edgar Rice Burroughs, which is very clearly a product of its time, and updated it to the next millennium. A man raised in the jungles of Africa and meeting people like him for the first time in his life is a brilliant basic idea for a story and Disney utilizes it beautifully, giving us a tale full of excitement, interesting characters, emotions, adventure, plots and betrayals, love and learning, courage and above all understanding.They've also updated the characters a little bit. Tarzan isn't quite as masculine and demigod-ish as he is in the book, and Jane isn't just a damsel to be rescued. Jane's father, the professor, is essentially the same though, which isn't a problem as his role is rather minimal, whereas the gorillas have been given some actual roles and characteristics. Unfortunately they failed Clayton utterly as a character, which is the only real problem with the film. I get that they needed a clearly defined villain for the film, but they have made layered villains before. Judge Frollo and Scar, for example. Both were clearly the villains of their films, but they had complicated motivations and were willing to utilize every advantage they had. Clayton is simply a big white hunter with a huge gun. Nothing interesting about that.Plus I'm personally rather annoyed by Rosie O'Donnell's Terk, but that's just me. The character is objectively just fine.All in all Tarzan fails to reach that all around perfection movies such as Beauty and the Beast or The Lion King have, but it's still one of my favourite Disney films, and definitely one of the best looking. The music is also great, the characters are great - with one glaring exception - and overall it's definitely under-appreciated for its sheer quality.
