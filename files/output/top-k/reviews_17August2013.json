But here, he stepped into Ronald Maxwell's territory of Civil War and romance. And he failed in many areas. This long, tedious movie plods much too often and at times is simply very vapid. Heroes talk, shoot, talk, curse, shoot, die, talk, love, shoot, die, walk away. We saw it before. Not every filmmaker can do good in this fairly huge scope of a history, and Lee is simply rushes through the very uneventful and prosaic script, adding some brutal scenes of looting and murder, some romantic clichés, some beautiful nature, some unexciting dialog, some promising moments... and fails. Toby Maguirs is not good as a main character, he lacks depth and often looks weak. Jewel is no good choice, either, she probably can croon, but play she ain't. James Caviezel, Tom Wilkinson and John Rhys Meyers are a bit better, but they do not save the mediocre film from being just another attempt to make a grand drama of love and war. Utterly forgettable and rather slow, often simply dead and bland, this movie is no achievement. Maxwell could have made this same script a spellbinding masterpiece. It takes a different man, sometimes ","genre":null},{"date":"17 August 2013","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Ang Lee is a cool filmmaker and he knows his craft.
