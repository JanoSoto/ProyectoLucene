An eerie atmosphere exudes from the picture, the sense of dread hangs heavy, and sure enough the dread is about to be realised........Sadly it's all down hill from that moment on, Friday The 13th Part 2 appealed to me many many years ago when i was a spotty teenager, back then any sort of blood and nudity was the pinnacle of cinema as far as i was concerned. Revisiting the film now, it's clear that it really doesn't have a great deal going for it. One thing the modern horror audiences learnt from Wes Craven's Scream franchise, is that teens in horror films are stupid, all lining up to be bloody blade fodder at the hands of a maniac. Formula remains the same, the girls run around in ridiculously short shorts, their bosoms bouncing with care free abandon, the blokes get horny and as we now know, any sort of sex results in a horribly grizzly murder. The deaths here are at least a bit inventive, and the first presence of Jason Vorhees at least gives the film a more solid, and decidedly evil axis to work from, whilst the score from Harry Manfredini, a sort of Psycho\/Jaws fusion with wisps of death, is highly effective.It just gets bogged down by characters nobody cares about and acting that belongs in a Russ Meyer picture. The Friday franchise does have the odd picture that scores high in in the horror entertainment stakes, part 2 falls somewhere in between OK and dreadful, an uneasy 5\/10 from me.
