Oh, there are other great ones--My Man Godfrey and Bringing Up Baby, certainly, and two slightly less zany ones, Philadelphia Story and of course the one that started it all, It Happened One Night.

Even the camera-work is fast and makes this chaos look completely reasonable, from the first scenes in the complicated newsroom to the later swirling scenes in the press room at the criminal building. Watch. And listen. If you can keep up.It probably helped just a little that the bugs were worked out of the screenplay here by the fact this began as a 1928 Ben Hecht stage play called The Front Page (in fact, one of the turning points has to do with soapbox politics that sound a decade out of date by 1939). This is also already a remake of the same play, under the original title (and this 1931 screwball prototype is quite amazing, too, though second fiddle to the Hawks version). Hawks and his screenwriter Charles Lederer updated the writing in other ways, though, mentioning the war in Europe, Hitler, and, for a big laugh, Grant's dimple.

I guess in some ways there just wasn't a way this thing could live up to the previous entry GOLDFINGER but I give the producers credit because they at least tried. This was a very frustrating movie to watch because on one hand it has some of the greatest action scenes from any movie and yet we've also got countless bad scenes that add up to nothing. This film could have been called By Land or By Water as it would be a fitting title but it would also explain the good and bad here. The bad stuff is pretty much everything on land. When the movie started it just had a been there, done that feeling to it that really seemed to sink things and in many ways it just felt like we've seen this type of film countless times before and much better. Even the womanizing scenes really didn't have much spark as they simply couldn't compare to previous films. I think another major problem is the supporting cast as poor Bond is pretty much on his own here. I didn't find any of the women to be overly appealing and I found the chemistry really lacking with Connery. As for Connery, he's certainly at the top of his game and gives another energetic performance but that's to be expected. I found Celi to be pretty good in the role of the villain but he's certainly not as flashy as those in the previous films and I think the bad guys around here are pretty weak as well. I'd also add that at 129-minutes the film goes on way too long. With all of that said, what makes the film worth watching are the amazing underwater sequences. I was really surprised to see how well done all of these scenes are and I'd say that each one of them were wonderfully directed and contained some great action and nice tension. The sharks in the pool were a nice tough and the scene where Connery finds himself trapped with them was terrific. The highlight is without question the final sequence underwater when we get a fifteen-minute, action packed ride that contains some great fights and some even better and very violent death scenes. Of course, when we get back on the boat things dry up again but this sequence is certainly a major point in the series so far.

Julianne Moore, Ellen Burstyn, Peter Falk - three of my favorites - aren't really offered enough to show their respective talents.

Director Anspaugh also made the film HOOSIERS, which is certainly a lot better than this one but there's no question that this is yet another winning entry in a genre that can deliver the goods when they get it right. I think these sports movies remain so popular simply because I'm sure everyone has a dream but more often than not these dreams go unfulfilled so when something special comes along and someone does get to fulfill these dreams, it makes for a terrific story and that's pretty much what we've got here. This entire movie is built around everyone telling Rudy it would be impossible for him to even get into Notre Dame let alone actually make the team. What's interesting is that Rudy never dreams about actually playing but instead he just wants to wear the uniform of the team he and his father (Ned Beatty) love. The movie actually contains very little sports stuff as the entire first hour is pretty much building Rudy's relationship with various people including a brain (Jon Favreau) who helps him with his grades and a grounds keeper (Charles S. Dutton) who begins to feel for him. These relationships gets a lot of the running time and it certainly helps make the movie as it shows someone certainly needs help in following their dreams and at times needs a little push in the right direction. I also thought the relationship between Rudy and his relatives made for some nice drama. This was somewhat of a comeback for Astin who made a name for himself years earlier in various teen movies but he does a terrific job here and certainly delivers the performance of his career. The amount of passion and soul he brings to the role certainly makes you care for Rudy and want to see him succeed. The ending is where a lot of the emotion comes from but for me the highlight is when Astin reads the final letter to see if he gets into the school or not. Favreau adds some nice laughs in his supporting role and Beatty is extremely strong as the father. Dutton also gets to shine in a couple good, motivational scenes. I think the one fault with RUDY is that they spend a bit too much time at the start showing how no one believes in the guy. I think there was a bit too much of this as the point is made very clearly and after a while it just seems like we're being hit over the head with the stuff. Jerry Goldsmith's passionate score also brings a lot of emotion to the film. While not one of the greatest sports movies ever made, this is still a very entertaining and moving film that I'm sure will remain a favorite to many people.

He only wants to talk about it because he feels like he owes it to the guy, who's life they are deciding about. All are reluctant at first, since it seemed to be a clear and done case but the more elements and proof gets debated about the more doubt arises about his guilt.

It's not as universally admired as Witness or Dead Poets Society, but has its defenders. When it came out it received mixed reviews and met financial failure. But Harrison Ford later said it had his favourite performance. The writing, which I think has always been the main quality of Weir's movies, isn't perfect here, and the main character can seem unlikeable. But the movie, the moment it starts showing the tensions that arise from different worlds coming into contact, is vintage Peter Weir.Based on a novel by Paul Theroux, the movie follows Allie Fox (Harrison Ford), an inventor who believes America has failed to live up to its values. He sees his beloved country as a victim of the welfare state, of foreign investment, of big corporations and of lack of ambition. Ambition and determination, however, are two things he has in spades. Love it or leave it, and Allie leaves with his family to Mosquitia, a fictional South American country. There he buys a town in the middle of the jungle and starts building the foundations of a new civilisation. His belief is that his ultimate invention, a machine that uses fire to create ice, will allow him to turn that piece of land into an earthly paradise.The Mosquito Coast is not Heart of Darkness; it's not even Apocalypse Now, in spite of the similarities. This movie is not about losing one's mind in the middle of the jungle, of crossing the limits of decency when one is not restrained by laws and mores. Allie is a pretty nice guy throughout the movie &#x96; a loving husband and father, an untiring worker, a fair leader of his community. Bringing technical improvement and comfort to a decadent town, he soon becomes admired and respected. And besides, he's already a bit crazy before coming to the jungle.Although Ford's performance seems exaggerated at times, it has an honesty and conviction that make Allie's occasional antics credible. And if in 1986 he just sounded like a capitalism-hating commie, his belief that the world exists to be perfected through imagination and hard work sounds quite sensible today now that we've realised we're slowly killing the planet and ourselves with it.But for some an imperfect world is perfect for business. Sharing the jungle with Allie are Christian missionaries, offering promises of a celestial paradise to compensate for all the hardships on earth. Hard work is unnecessary; faith suffices. Needless to say this doesn't sit well with Allie. And in Mosquitia also lurk mercenaries, amoral men ready to exploit Allie's community.The movie is narrated by Allie's son Charlie (played by River Phoenix). Although Phoenix's performance is solid, the voice over is redundant and should have stayed in the novel. Weir has always been excellent at visual storytelling and one can't help thinking that Charlie is only narrating the movie to make it easier for the audiences to know how to feel about the protagonist. Charlie describes the admiration, and later fear and anger, he feels for his father, but Phoenix's own body language does a good job of showing this.Helen Mirren, failing horribly at an American accent, gives a nevertheless fine performance as Allie's wife. Composer Maurice Jarre, famous for his collaborations with director David Lean, composes one of his most ethereal scores for this movie, bringing a very strange sense of serenity to it. And Weir's camera work is amazing as usual, equally at ease in the suburbs and in the middle of the jungle, capturing nature in all its beauty and menace. Although it's not one of Peter Weir's best movies, twenty-four years later The Mosquito Coast still holds some pleasures for viewers.

Each character is based on a real life person, and some of these people even play themselves in the film. It's very hard to believe because every single person in this movie is clinically insane.This movie surprised & impressed the heck out of me. I thought it would be a straightforward thriller, but it's more like a dark comedy with a deep social message. Sort of like Heathers meets To Kill a Mockingbird.In the tradition of The Unforgiven, director Clint Eastwood again takes us to a place where what you see ain't always what you get. There are 2 sides to every story, and it's just a momentary line that separates the two (as the title says Midnight in the Garden of Good & Evil).The plot is almost insignificant in light of this. If you watch this film, focus on the dichotomy of outward appearances vs. what's beneath. At times it's about abstract concepts like loyalty which seems solid on the surface, but when tested it flops like a bad soufflé. At other times the theme is quite literal, as with a flamboyantly feminine woman who's hiding a man's toolbox under her dress, if ya know what I mean. Everyone in this kooky town has some secret deviation, even though they all coexist in an atmosphere of fine southern charm.Watch John Cusack's expressions closely, and I guarantee you'll get a few big LOLs. He plays the role of a New York writer who finds himself in the middle of this bizarre world, struggling to get a grasp of what's real. He spends most of the first half with his mouth wide open in disbelief.The second half is when the plot kicks in, taking us on a murder mystery and its subsequent courtroom drama. Here the film changes to a more serious tone, but the themes remain the same. Don't expect any car chases, shootouts or flashy pyrotechnics. Don't even expect much of a Sherlock Holmesian revelation to the mystery. But if you go into it not knowing what to expect, I think you'll have a great time.

It's very hard to believe because every single person in this movie is clinically insane.This movie surprised & impressed the heck out of me. I thought it would be a straightforward thriller, but it's more like a dark comedy with a deep social message. Sort of like Heathers meets To Kill a Mockingbird.In the tradition of The Unforgiven, director Clint Eastwood again takes us to a place where what you see ain't always what you get. There are 2 sides to every story, and it's just a momentary line that separates the two (as the title says Midnight in the Garden of Good & Evil).The plot is almost insignificant in light of this. If you watch this film, focus on the dichotomy of outward appearances vs. what's beneath. At times it's about abstract concepts like loyalty which seems solid on the surface, but when tested it flops like a bad soufflé. At other times the theme is quite literal, as with a flamboyantly feminine woman who's hiding a man's toolbox under her dress, if ya know what I mean. Everyone in this kooky town has some secret deviation, even though they all coexist in an atmosphere of fine southern charm.Watch John Cusack's expressions closely, and I guarantee you'll get a few big LOLs. He plays the role of a New York writer who finds himself in the middle of this bizarre world, struggling to get a grasp of what's real. He spends most of the first half with his mouth wide open in disbelief.The second half is when the plot kicks in, taking us on a murder mystery and its subsequent courtroom drama. Here the film changes to a more serious tone, but the themes remain the same. Don't expect any car chases, shootouts or flashy pyrotechnics. Don't even expect much of a Sherlock Holmesian revelation to the mystery. But if you go into it not knowing what to expect, I think you'll have a great time.

I think this film did a good job, even with it being in the middle of WW II, in showing common German soldiers as well as a couple of fanatical Nazi officers. Remember, the Nazis were a political party. Not all of the established military officers were members, but some surely were. And, for younger people today who may think of this as too overtly propagandistic or overboard, I highly recommend seeing the documentary film, The Unknown Soldier(2006). Produced in Germany, from an in-depth exploration and exposé of German soldiers in WWII, the film shows how deeply the super-race fanaticism penetrated even within the regular military ranks. That exposé was the result of many grandchildren of WWII German soldiers finding and asking questions about photos showing their grandfathers with hanged Jews, murdered women and children, and the likes. So, Sahara came out right in the middle of the war and was quite accurate in its scenes discussing the Nazis under Hitler and the Italians under Mussolini. Some reviewers think that the film got a little preachy in a couple of places where Bogart's character talks about defeating the Nazis.

Then I recollected that, although many of The Critics seem to have awarded the accolade for writing bizarre and incoherent scripts to Kaufman, there have been many others equally strange such as Boorman's 'Zardoz', Greenaway's 'The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover', or ...... ........ and I suddenly thought of Tobe Hooper's 'Lifeforce'. My recollections of this 1985 melodrama were principally of a totally incoherent script, a sound track loud enough to damage normal hearing and video sequences perversely designed to force viewer's to close their eyes if they wished to avoid a headache. The only thing I could remember about its story was that vampires originate in outer space (where it seems it is very difficult to get any clothes) and are BAD. Perhaps, I thought. these limited memories are unfair, or maybe my appreciation of unusual scripts has matured. So I decided to watch it again (on DVD with the volume turned down to a safe level!). The experiment was not a success. Its script seemed no more coherent - whilst a Kaufman's script challenges viewers to think, that of 'Lifeforce' seemed to dare them to do so. Deprived of any touch of logic, I wanted to reach for the on-off switch..Part of my problem is that I am used to employing the word 'Lifeforce' in the sense in which George Bernard Shaw used it in the prefaces to so many of his plays. GBS was an agnostic, but never an atheist, he was a firm believer in the gradual evolutionary improvement of the human species which could be attributed to a natural progression based on the cumulative experiences of mankind since our species first evolved. and which is manifested in the almost universal desire of parents for their offspring to have a 'better' life. He always described this guiding process, which is perhaps similar to the Eastern concept of Kama, as due to the lifeforce. This is a much more sophisticated meaning that that used in the film where it has been reduced to just the potential energy stored in every living body to sustain essential life processes such as breathing, blood circulation, and mental control of bodily functions when we are tired or asleep (SPOILER - In this film it also became a target to be acquired by the space vampires who have presumably run out of other energy supplies from their own planet. There could be a challenging theme here for a film looking at a coherent situation where external energy supplies gradually dwindle to almost nothing, but 'Lifeforce' was not interested in any of this - only in exploiting the maximum shock effect it could achieve within its running time.) Mostly it was inherently boring, often distasteful and sometimes downright unpleasant. All this could be forgiven for the right story but here any intended story line was contemptuously disregarded.A few sequences were visually imaginative and challenging, so I did consider awarding 'Lifeforce' 2 stars, but what the heck - If I go out and shoot a visually stimulating movie in the grounds where I live, this could not warrant 2 stars in the absence of any coherent film-script. I recognise that tastes differ and not all IMDb users will agree with me in my assessment, but if I am to try to provide some honest guidance to my readers, it has to be one star.

He soon finds out that the world is a dystopian society ruled by a single leader, where people have robot servants, get pleasure from a machine called the orgasmatron and the totalitarian police capture anyone suspect of being an alien and wipe their memory.Along the way of trying to defeat this evil plan, he runs into a self-important poet, Luna, played by the beautiful and charming Diane Keaton. This gives an opportunity for Allen to inject some of his famous banter, and fortunately there are some terrific one-liners in this film. Allen has always attempted to combine his love of stand-up and more deeper themes such as Freudian analysis and philosophical discussion in his films and he does here as well, although it feels a bit out of place. He also paces the film so fast that we hardly have time to react to his jokes, be they verbal or physical.The main thing to take from this is the sheer ambition and bravery Allen shows in attempting to take comedy to a different level and direction. Certainly, he would modify and perfect his style and writing, but his early experiments still prove funny today and much better than nearly all comedies produced in the last ten years.

He soon finds out that the world is a dystopian society ruled by a single leader, where people have robot servants, get pleasure from a machine called the orgasmatron and the totalitarian police capture anyone suspect of being an alien and wipe their memory.Along the way of trying to defeat this evil plan, he runs into a self-important poet, Luna, played by the beautiful and charming Diane Keaton. This gives an opportunity for Allen to inject some of his famous banter, and fortunately there are some terrific one-liners in this film. Allen has always attempted to combine his love of stand-up and more deeper themes such as Freudian analysis and philosophical discussion in his films and he does here as well, although it feels a bit out of place. He also paces the film so fast that we hardly have time to react to his jokes, be they verbal or physical.The main thing to take from this is the sheer ambition and bravery Allen shows in attempting to take comedy to a different level and direction. Certainly, he would modify and perfect his style and writing, but his early experiments still prove funny today and much better than nearly all comedies produced in the last ten years.

But I always enjoy good biographies, whether in the form of books or films, and for me Carrington is a delightful film to be both savoured and treasured.However London was home to the so-called Bloomsbury group so they became best known in the U.K., and this film would be more readily appreciated there than in North America. The group consisted mainly of the leisured and fairly well to do junior offspring of aristocratic families who were able to spend almost all their time actively participating in the worlds of literature, drama or the arts. Its members were unusual in being very contemptuous of the contemporary moral code, whilst still having strong moral scruples that essentially governed all their actions. World War 1 occurred during the period when they had their greatest influence on British society, and many members of the group became infamous for being conscientious objectors to participating in the war on ethical rather than religious grounds. Sexually they had very progressive attitudes, and generalizing to perhaps a dangerous extent, they viewed personal commitments which had to be preserved as all important, but believed these commitments were made between the individuals concerned and were no business of either the Church or the State.Featured in this film are Emily Carrington and Lytton Strachey. She was a very well regarded artist who seemed to have some repugnance about exhibiting or selling her works in the usual way. He was essentially an essayist who achieved both fame and success with the publication of Eminent Victorians - a book of condensed biographies, many only a few paragraphs long but all showing considerable ability to pick out the key character traits that ultimately contributed most to the public image of the individuals concerned. Both are played (by Emma Thompson and Jonathan Pryce) with remarkable depth and sincerity.These brief comments may help anyone who has read little of the characters involved to understand why the film is of real interest to so many older viewers; they can do nothing to convey the charm and yet knife sharp precision it shows in displaying the activities of its principal protagonists. I find it hard to assess how far their activities might become of interest to younger viewers who have no familiarity with the period, purely on the strength of this film. I can however assure those who do not share my background that I found the film not only truly fascinating but also an immensely satisfying viewing experience. Usually, if a film biography causes me to look out for the book on which it was based, this is an indication that the film did not really succeed,; but not so on this occasion when I just felt the urge to enjoy more of the fascinating story.I rate this film at eight stars on the IMDb scale - if I had felt it would have a more universal appeal this would have probably been nine. In what they attempted to do its makers have shown near genius, and both the cinematography and acting are almost above reproach. Today I suspect that some will find it boring, but I believe they will be far fewer than might be expected from the subject matter - this is a prime example of one of the very few outstanding film biographies where a viewer almost feels he or she has got to know the actual characters being portrayed..

In fact, even though I find it great now, I think I see more that makes it so than I did as a child. As an adult, I notice things I didn't previously. The mark of a good movie is if that can happen--if you can come back years later and see some new things--and you still like it! This is a good movie.As a child, it was scary and funny anc clever and cute. As an adult, I'm noticing how timeless it is. Even the setting makes it difficult to tell it's 20 years old. And I'm just now realizing how well off the McCallisters were! The house is the bomb! And taking a family trip to France? Who does that? How awesome is that? Now I find myself wishing I could have that lifestyle! Before, I don't think I even noticed.To sum it up, the people who created this movie were forward-thinking. They pushed the envelope as far as characterization and dialogue. Kevin is a character you just don't see everyday. The supporting characters are all A+. Everyone seems to just fit their roles. Beyond that, the plot is clever and the setting is very realistic (notice the details in the house decorating next time you see it, no corners were left unturned it seems.) Basically, this is just a well-made movie that should make all of us proud to have it as part of our American culture. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"27 July 2010","score":"","review":" This movie came out in 1990--wow.
