[{"date":"7 June 2006","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Quills has been sitting on my DVD shelf for at least a good month now. I had been meaning to watch it, but something always seemed to get in the way. I figured I would just wait until school let out. School let out and a week passed...I finally put the DVD into my player.I know I would enjoy the film even before I began to watch it. Being a Rush, Phoenix, Winslet, and Caine fan I knew I couldn't go wrong. I wasn't let down, I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It was entertaining from beginning to end. My only complaint would be the Dr. Royer-Collard story line. While it wasn't boring...far from that...it just seemed rather awkward. I'm not saying it was bad, so I guess that I can't very well call it a complaint. It just seemed out of place to me.Geoffrey Rush as The Marquis de Sade was of course deserving of the Oscar nomination that he received for this fine performance. I believe that he was the most worthy actor to receive the statue that year...he deserved the nomination and should have gotten the win.Kate Winslet as Madeleine LeClerc. Though, it may have been the weakest performance of the main four actors, it still was fantastic nonetheless. For me I'm on the fence as to whether or not I think she should have received a nomination.Joaquin Phoenix as The Abbe du Coulmier made me bump him up to one of my favorite actors. Phoenix played the protagonist, and had great emotional depth to boot. He definitely should have received a nomination next to his nomination for his role in Gladiator.Finally, Dr. Royer-Collard played by Sir Michael Caine. The good doctor, as he is called, was a wonderful character. Caine really did a fantastic job of making me hate him. Though, he didn't need any proof that he is a great actor...this is indeed the proof right here.Quills had a major Oscar nod and two minor ones, but I believe that it should have made it in the following categories Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor (Phoenix), Best Screenplay based on previously published material (Mr. Doug Wright), and possibly Best Actress (Winslet). This was a great film and I give it a nine out of ten.
