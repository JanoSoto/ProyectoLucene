In order to restore peace to his swamp, Shrek makes a deal to go on an arduous journey to rescue a princess, but his trek is aided\/hampered by the presence of a motor-mouthed donkey.

With the exception of a good opening sequence, a couple of clever parodies, and a likable cast, there isn't much reason to tune in for this one; another fast-tracked, badly written sequel that takes its audience for suckers, and tries to cash in on the success of a much better predecessor.

It is one of those movies where it seems that the actors were just given free reign to have fun with their parts. Oliver Platt steals every scene he is in, and the Colombian Cartel members are quite amusing as well.  Liam Neeson and his group therapy session is quite enjoyable as well.  Even Sandra Bullock is amusing, especially when giving a colonic.  This is a movie that looks like it was fun to make, and it can be just as fun to watch.  This is not a taut thriller, a gritty cop film, a clever spy movie, or an intellectual comedy.  It is fun.  Have fun with it. If you don't like to have fun then go see the new Time Machine.
