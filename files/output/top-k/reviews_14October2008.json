If you are a die-hard romantic who melts at a brilliantly delivered proposal of love following a long series of disappointments and heartbreaks, then you must not miss this movie.This film is right up there with Persuasion with Amanda Root and Ciáran Hinds and Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle for excellence in scripting, set design, location, costumes, music and cinematography, and not to forget the eye-soothing dances that made Pride and Prejudice so enjoyable. There are surprises in the cast too which is always welcome. For once Maggie Smith is not anywhere in sight, though I love her. And Judi Dench has mercifully not invaded the celluloid universe of Jane Austen adaptations. Gwyneth Paltrow is a brilliant Emma, if a tiny bit self-conscious a couple of times about her 18th century English accent, which is believable and natural for the most part. Her acting skills make up for any slight blemish anywhere else in her performance. Physically she is perfect. Beautiful, natural-looking and willowy. The only difficulty is believing that a creature like that should not be married to a Duke already.As is turns out she marries a wonderful man, John Knightly, handsomely done, in every sense of the word, by Jeremy Northam. His speech of proposal to Emma at the end is deeply moving and, though I am a muscular manly guy, most of the time, I always find myself wanting to be Emma at this moment. The arc between these two characters, Emma and John, is perfectly written by Austen and enhanced here with the canny direction and camera angles for intimate moments between these two characters. There interaction alone made me certain that Emma is a love story, pure and simple. I don't know exactly what I thought it was before, perhaps just one of the gossipy farces that has a sweet ending. No, this is heavy-hitting Love for those like myself who are In Love at the moment. If you are not on that same page this movie might not impact you in quite the same way.The supporting cast is splendid. Notably Sophie Thompson's Miss Bates, Phyllida Law's Mother Bate's, Polly Walker's demure and elegant Jane Fairfax and Juliet Stevenson's ghastly Mrs Elton. No weak links beyond a shaky scene when Ewan McGregor has to sing an old love song to the accompaniment of a fortepiano. Suffice it to say, he can't sing. And he is a bit glib with some of his lines, sounding decidedly 20th and not 18th century. But his air of breezy caddishness fits the character of the shallow and flip Frank Churchill. Toni Collette steals all of her scenes from everyone else. Her pink and pudgy Miss Smith is adorable and touching. I also greatly loved Greta Scacchi's Mrs Weston, still utterly gorgeous in middle age, and an actress of great range and depth.This Emma would get a 10 were it not for the possible miscasting of McGregor as Frank and a couple of linguistic missteps by Paltrow. AND the story has been perhaps a little over- sentimentalized. Jane Austen's original had a more cool, classical tone.

Can there be enough cynicism in looking at the history of Old-West Americans and American Indians? After so many years of Westerns showing things as black and white- of John Wayne Vs. Tonto and the like- there needed to be a good dose of reality, but not just by any run of the mill filmmaker. Altman is able to sympathize with the Indians while at the same time adding a certain mystery to them (how they cross the river, come back from the mountains). On top of this he makes a very strong, funny comment on celebrity and mythology in a somewhat typical de-mythological style. It's not entirely an anti-centennial statement (his real centennial movie is Nashville), but one that criticizes things while still staying true as a semi-serious comedy.In fact, this has a few of the funniest scenes in any Altman picture. Take when Annie Oakley (Geraldine Chaplin) is performing her 'stunt' with her partner, and throughout the picture it's been a dicey and tense act with it never being as clear-cut as it should be; Annie is always talking to herself in mid-shot, asking to try it again if she misses. Then when it comes time to do the 'stunt' in front of President Cleveland, she shoots her partner right through the shoulder, with it (mostly) being passed off like nothing happened. Little asides like this that build up- or, for example, a hatred for birds that inexplicably Bill has against the cheery German singer who owns it, leading up to a frantic shoot-em-up against the bird's cage until it escapes. Sometimes it's simply funny ho-ho humor, the kind that one might have a quick chuckle and then see back to what's going on. But it's brilliant funny ho-ho comedy, where manners are tested to the extremes in the face of Buffalo Bill's troupe and the unmovable Sitting Bull and his 'voice' played by Chief from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.There is actually something of a firmer story for Altman than usual, though that goes without saying it's like a belt thrown on once in a while with a pair of pants. Buffalo Bill is riding on his reputation, and hosts a big-time show that is a good lot like the circus only real physical prowess and weirdness replaced usually by good-old-fashioned American storytelling, which is, basically, that Indians killed a lot of people and then Buffalo Bill struck back. When Sitting Bull actually comes to the act to be apart of it, he has some conditions to be in it, *many* conditions, some easy (i.e. setting up camp across the river), some that test Bill's patience (i.e. changing the whole story of Sitting Bull to show Bill killing masses of Indians). Meanwhile, President Cleveland is coming for a special visit, Bill's drinking gets bigger, and he loses the thread of his own presumed skills like when he can't bring back Sitting Bull and his group when the escape to the mountains.This all leads up to a conclusion that has a double-side to it. On the one hand the very end should feel kind of conventional, where Buffalo Bill faces off against Sitting Bull (or rather another actor playing him), and 'wins' in front of the cheering audience. On the other hand this is preceded by a tragic note, and a very strange, near perfect dream scene where Buffalo Bill confronts and constantly shifting-position Sitting Bull, confronting him as well as his own ego and reputation. At the end of it all, Altman isn't saying outright America is evil or anything; it's that there are some serious wounds caused not simply by the obvious Americans vs Indians but by over a century of holding up icons to the sky without the slightest gray area or real humanization past superhero status. And in the midst of all this, in the work of Altman's usual good ensemble (Keitel, Joel Grey, Chaplin are very good, Lancaster good if in a superfluous mouth-piece role), Paul Newmna shines incredibly in a role that requires him to be star-like but to also get into the shallowness and inner demons of the character.

It was entertaining, funny but yet so sad.The mystery is actually engrossing!The film is about two characters who are miserable in their love lives (for different reasons) and in a strange country far from home. Their friendship develops so nicely and quickly that they become so attached to each other that saying goodbye is the hardest thing in the world.As much as the film shows happiness in the form of the friendship, the film touches you in an all different way towards its end. After seeing this film, I found myself thinking about it all too much afterwards.

But consider for a moment the differences. Sunset Boulevard is about the industry, a play of metafiction with Gloria Swanson essentially playing herself, and Cecil B. Demille and Erich von Stroheim essentially playing themselves, drawing dark ironies to indict the Hollywood world. Everyone knows it'll go down as one of the greatest films of all time, and the definitive picture about Tinseltown.But Ed Wood is about film-making, a passion for the craft, the resilience to chase a vision, and the deep reverence for stars we adored but never really got to know. But we do have the fortune of getting to know renown horror actor Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau, in an unforgettable performance) as a deeply-flawed morphine addict. He's prideful, lonely, and warped by the industry similar to Swanson's Norma Desmond.Except now we don't have William Holden's Joe Gillis around to exploit the fallen star. In Ed Wood we have Johnny Depp, in one of his greatest, most moving performances as the famed bad filmmaker Wood. Unlike the conniving Gillis, Wood is kind and unconditionally loving, but just plain untalented. That doesn't matter, though. We come to love him quickly because of his humility and optimism-- two traits so often overlooked in today's protagonists. (An odd coincidence that Forrest Gump was released the same year!) The film didn't do so well at the box office for many reasons. Most notably, it is marketed as a comedy. And yes, it is a comedy. But it's funny because it's got heart, not for the screwball sarcasm you'd expect from the director of Beetlejuice and Batman. You can see Burton pouring his heart and his pain into characters, the way he did in his more personal masterwork Edward Scissorhands. In this film, you laugh at Ed Wood because he's a quirky yet likable guy. But you love him because he's got dreams. He tries really hard and chases down his passions the way Orson Welles did, the way many of us wish we had the guts to.The film is a triumph on many levels. Stylistically, it's an homage to the great sci-fi chillers and monster movies of the 40s and 50s like The Day the Earth Stood Still, Earth vs. The Flying Saucers Frankenstein and (of course) Dracula. Actors deliver their lines in hammy fashion, with theatrical gestures and overactive enthusiasm. Shot in B&W, the opening with Criswell (Jeffrey Jones) emerging from a coffin to give a prologue is ingenious, as are a montage through a miniature set with gravestones and saucers hung up by fishing wire, and an end credit sequence that concludes with a placard reading Filmed in Hollywood, CA, U.S.A. This film loves the movies and loves its history.But it's a winning film mostly because of Depp and Landau. They are friends in the way that so many of us wish relationships could be-- a person who loves us for exactly who we are, no matter how imperfect-- who stands beside us even when everyone in the world says we're no good or we're a has-been. There's a scene at about the 1\/2-way point where Wood tells Lugosi, Sorry about asking you to climb into that ice-cold pond at 3 in the morning. A man as great as you should never have to do something like that. Without skipping a beat, Lugosi smiles and says, Eddie, there are only a few people in the world I would do it for. That's friendship. It baffles me that in an age of cinema when characters and relationships are so devoid of depth, a film like this hits it right on the head.The final scene is a stunner in the great tradition of Hollywood endings. Wood has just screened his masterpiece Plan 9 From Outer Space which he dedicated to Lugosi. Most people know he was likely booed out of the theater. But Burton wisely skips over that portion and shows Wood scurrying out under the marquee hand in hand with his girlfriend Kathy (Patricia Arquette). It's raining and as he approaches his convertible parked out in front, he says, Honey, let's get married! Right now, let's go to Vegas! Kathy says, But Eddie, it's raining and the car top is stuck. Wood smiles and says Phooey, it's only a five hour drive and it'll probably stop by the time we get to the desert. Heck it'll probably stop by the time we get around the corner. Let's go... This moment defines Ed Wood, perhaps not as he was in real life, but as we've come to know him in the film. He's an optimist. Who cares if he was the worst filmmaker of all time? He's full of hope.

It's a film about discovery; about adventure; about venturing off and away from home or a comfort zone to explore and discover. This exploration will be littered with danger and threat but it will evoke an element of magic and the unreal for equal measure although the smart move Disney make in Beauty and the Beast is that they do not clearly define who the 'villain' is and nor do they dumb down this role. In fact Disney bring an air of study and greater extent to the material other than shoddy metaphorical content, something that they very rarely did so before this and thus; Beauty and the Beast earns its place amongst the circles when talking about some of their best films.The film could be read as if told to us aurally, that is to say the immediate beginning is being narrated to us and we have rough sketches that look as if they're straight out of the Medieval era presented to us in story book fashion. These still images confirm to us of a Prince's back-story of how he became so hideous in appearance and how his castle and its inhabitants became so equally physically deformed, some of which are transformed into items that resemble their role in the castle whereas some others are not. Here is an interesting study of character 'bodies' within film, a brief reference to centuries ago during which what you wore would immediately tell others of your 'role' in the world ie; Royalty, jesters and peasants would all clearly be labelled by the clothes they wore &#150; this is significant due to the various items the castle's workers are transformed into and the manner in which the 'style' of the early images are presented to us in that mock, Medieval fashion.So if characters like Mrs. Potts (Lansbury) are transformed into a teapot because she's the maid that makes and brings the tea; the Stove (Cummings) is transformed into his namesake since he is the chef and the flirtatious French maid is transformed into a brush to signify her job as a cleaner then it's possible to read into the fact the two individuals we the audience follow more often than not, those being Cogsworth (Ogden Stiers) and Lumiere (Orbach), are of a certain elevated level since it's difficult to place a candelabra and a clock into a realm of profession within the domestic environment. If there's one thing people have had fun in reading into over the years then it's Disney and their particular animation styling they choose; characters with lean or fat builds can signify one thing; characters with very astute or pointed expressions another whereas a rounded character with a big smile and bright blue eyes could easily be associated with heroic tendencies.The Beast (Benson) himself is not necessarily transformed into something as he is turned inside out. The character of the Prince is an unkind 'beast' on the inside and has these psychological characteristics switched so he must physically resemble a 'beast' or a monster, cruel and consuming none-the-less. But Beauty and the Beast is more so a character study of the mind rather than just how fancy Disney can make and force us to identify with each character's animation. As a character, Belle (O'Hara) plays the protagonist and like most female Disney protagonists, she lacks a motherly figure but does her very best to figure out what's right anyway. As a character with a persona she is smart and outgoing, an independent woman who will not conform to stereotypes but will maintain an attitude that has an element of feminism throughout.Her mission through the film changes a few times, on one occasion actually reverting back to a prior one. Initially she sets out to rescue her father, Maurice (Everhart), after he is kept in the very castle the Beast inhabits following a similar exchange comparable to that of the enchanted woman at the beginning when she also requested shelter from outside forces. Things take a turn for the worst and Belle's new goal having achieved the last one is to stay behind with the Beast after which she must get used to. Belle begins the film within the filmic space that is 'the farm'; a simplistic and rural setting which is located within 'the village', a setting in which all inside is 'good' and everything outside is 'evil' or at least unknown and mysterious. Belle doesn't conform to the caricature she should do within these spaces and this is highlighted with a wonderful early musical number in which the villagers call her 'strange' and 'funny' because she's a free thinker and she reads books.Completing a future love triangle is Gaston (White), a physically powerful and space dominating character who possesses so much love for Belle, it leads to obsession &#150; you get the feeling in the real world if Belle had developed a relationship with someone else in the village, Gaston may well have challenged them because of it. He dominates his assistant Lefou (Corti) in the same manner Beast dominates his assistants initially within the castle planting a seed in the audience's mind to do with power struggles and what would happen if these two came up against each other. But Beast becomes more human when he seems to treat the assistants with more respect and is presented in compromising situations such as looking daft following a bath, whereas Gaston goes the other way. The film is a great study for certain things and will no doubt remain highly rated in years to come.

The character of the Prince is an unkind 'beast' on the inside and has these psychological characteristics switched so he must physically resemble a 'beast' or a monster, cruel and consuming none-the-less. But Beauty and the Beast is more so a character study of the mind rather than just how fancy Disney can make and force us to identify with each character's animation. As a character, Belle (O'Hara) plays the protagonist and like most female Disney protagonists, she lacks a motherly figure but does her very best to figure out what's right anyway. As a character with a persona she is smart and outgoing, an independent woman who will not conform to stereotypes but will maintain an attitude that has an element of feminism throughout.Her mission through the film changes a few times, on one occasion actually reverting back to a prior one. Initially she sets out to rescue her father, Maurice (Everhart), after he is kept in the very castle the Beast inhabits following a similar exchange comparable to that of the enchanted woman at the beginning when she also requested shelter from outside forces. Things take a turn for the worst and Belle's new goal having achieved the last one is to stay behind with the Beast after which she must get used to. Belle begins the film within the filmic space that is 'the farm'; a simplistic and rural setting which is located within 'the village', a setting in which all inside is 'good' and everything outside is 'evil' or at least unknown and mysterious. Belle doesn't conform to the caricature she should do within these spaces and this is highlighted with a wonderful early musical number in which the villagers call her 'strange' and 'funny' because she's a free thinker and she reads books.Completing a future love triangle is Gaston (White), a physically powerful and space dominating character who possesses so much love for Belle, it leads to obsession &#150; you get the feeling in the real world if Belle had developed a relationship with someone else in the village, Gaston may well have challenged them because of it. He dominates his assistant Lefou (Corti) in the same manner Beast dominates his assistants initially within the castle planting a seed in the audience's mind to do with power struggles and what would happen if these two came up against each other. But Beast becomes more human when he seems to treat the assistants with more respect and is presented in compromising situations such as looking daft following a bath, whereas Gaston goes the other way.

It's a film about discovery; about adventure; about venturing off and away from home or a comfort zone to explore and discover. This exploration will be littered with danger and threat but it will evoke an element of magic and the unreal for equal measure although the smart move Disney make in Beauty and the Beast is that they do not clearly define who the 'villain' is and nor do they dumb down this role. In fact Disney bring an air of study and greater extent to the material other than shoddy metaphorical content, something that they very rarely did so before this and thus; Beauty and the Beast earns its place amongst the circles when talking about some of their best films.The film could be read as if told to us aurally, that is to say the immediate beginning is being narrated to us and we have rough sketches that look as if they're straight out of the Medieval era presented to us in story book fashion. These still images confirm to us of a Prince's back-story of how he became so hideous in appearance and how his castle and its inhabitants became so equally physically deformed, some of which are transformed into items that resemble their role in the castle whereas some others are not.

Each installment features a new story and new characters that are tied together as a comic book, in introducing and concluding segments at the beginning and end of the movie. Notably, George A. Romero directed the flick and it was written by Stephen King, a conjoining of two horror icons who work together to produce these frightful shorts. I'll break it down episode by episode.First, we start off with a lead-off segment, about a boy's explorations of a trashy horror comic and his father's extreme (and when I say extreme, I mean ridiculous verbal expulsion) disapproval of said picture-book. What got me from the start was the pumpkin in the window. But it does start the intrigue flowing, which is important.Father's Day - This segment is not one of the stronger ones - the plot is the basic zombie-revenge formula, where the only thing working for it is the absurdity of the father jonesing for his cake. It's entertaining at best, and at worst grating, because the story doesn't feel fleshed out enough. The viewer is given bare bones as to what is going on, leaving to the imagination why the whole family is sitting and waiting for the aunt and why no one cares enough about anyone to actually worry about their feelings. It's humorous, but not a very hearty meal - we get the dessert before the dinner (in this case, cake).The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill - It's not a very suspenseful story, but it's not meant to be. What Jordy Verrill does is take a potentially serious, frightening experience and make it hilarious. King seems to be a natural at redneck characters, and he brings Jordy Verrill to life. I love the comic book feel in this one, especially the dusky, lonesome night on the farm and the lush greenery of the fake weeds. Jordy Verrill captures the attention like Father's Day couldn't.Something to Tide You Over - ...Tide You Over is much creepier than the last two shorts, and also much darker and less comedic. Nielsen's over-the-top character presents the audience with a great acting session, as Richard broods in the mentally-insane-who-laughs-crazily bunch of kooks. I like the atmosphere that this segment presented, as seeing Danson and Ross struggle against the water that's rushing up to their face gives a frightful claustrophobic feeling. Later on, after all the harrowing events have ended and Richard is faced with the two lover zombies, the tension kind of turns on its side and dissipates. For the most part, though, this story really captures the serious horror that the film is both depicting and mocking. The only thing I could have used was some more introduction to the characters, since the reasons for Richard's dementia and his torturous desires are a bit elusive.The Crate - The Crate is one of my favorites in this film, since it's a bloody, comedic mess. There are a bunch of creepy moments, because the audience's expectations are toyed with whenever someone gets close to the box. I love the red lighting every time violence happens, even if it has no meaning. The only thing that I really didn't like about this tale is the fact that the beginning meanders far too long. Granted, it gives exposition on the abusive wife, but we can see this throughout the whole film, especially with the extensive murderous dream sequences, and so it feels like the beginning is just too stretched out.They're Creeping Up On You! - It's a simple premise, but a really disturbing and creepy one. They're Creeping... actually makes your skin itch, what with all the roaches running around and how ruthless Upson Pratt really is. There's no sense of remorse for the man - all through the movie, we have the feeling that he's getting what has been a long time coming. The way he treats his employees and even his doorman shows he has led a really spoiled life, and now his spoiled attitude is going to get the boot. There are plenty of gross-out scenes for those who hate insects, so it's good,scary fun.As a whole, Creepshow works.

If you can accept that, you may see that this is one of the more fascinating films ever made. Unlike any film since its most similar relative, 2001, it's a visionary odyssey filled with just as much philosophy as special effects.But effects aren't meant to be the show, and I fault Dreamworks for releasing it as a Spielberg summer film, because the public was waiting for the next E.T. when this was more a continuation of HAL the Supercomputer rather than that beloved Carlo Rambaldi puppet who carried around a potted plant with a healing finger.A.I. begins in a board room where Professor Hobby (William Hurt) challenges scientists with the notion of creating a robot that can mimic the most human of traits-- love. In this futuristic world, robots perform many tasks-- cook, clean, even provide sex-- all for their owners' pleasure. But Hobby says this is primitive, and a real proposition would be to create a robot that is essentially human. It's a new spin on the Gepetto story. To create a human, one must know what constitutes a human. And Hobby's answer is love, like a child's love of his parent.Thus comes the plot. David (Haley Joel Osment) is a prototype brought home by engineer Henry (Sam Robards) for his grieving wife Monica (Frances O'Connor) who has lost her son to disease. After a rocky start, this robot provides its owners pleasure and utility (like all machines do). But when the couple's real son is cured and revived, the robot is no longer necessary. Actually, it's a burden to keep. So they dump it in the woods.Let's examine this for a second. This is humanity at its grittiest. Humans are self-serving and sinful by nature, if we recall from the Genesis story of The Fall. We treat one another like objects, disposing of whatever displeases us or no longer gives us utility. Yes, we're that bad.Well, the movie doesn't stop there. It spends the next hour with David and Gigolo Joe (Jude Law in one of his strongest supporting performances) as they forge through the real world, with Joe teaching David harsh realities of existence and the dichotomy between robots and humans. Humans are emotional, and therefore dangerous. Robots do not have bias; they're programmed to do one thing, and they do it.That is, except David. And he exhibits the one trait other robots do not have-- Emotion. The yearning for things that do not exist. The desire to risk everything to chase after potential happiness elsewhere. While robots are resigned to their fate, David exhibits hope. In a remarkable journey through a Vegas-like city into a stark vision of a post-global-warming water-world that once was Manhattan, David finally finds Professor Hobby's office. He enters the workshop of his Creator, like man entering heaven, and what does he see? Not God. But thousands of other Davids, prepackaged in cellophane, ready for shipment. It's a haunting scene, a shocking realization that while we may desire God's love, we are not loved any more or less than every other one of His billions of creations. Was I the only one who found it utterly profound when David finally encounters the Blue Fairy (the entity he believes will make him a real boy)? The moment he touches her, she shatters into pieces! If you didn't, you may have never chased down a dream only to be shocked by the realization that the dream is just an illusion. (Consider that Teddy says we are in a cage when they're trapped under the ferris wheel while in pursuit of her.) I could go on... but I will stop with just one final point. Remember at the beginning of the film, you have Hobby and other scientists discussing how essentially to create humans... or at least replicas so close to human they are virtually indistinguishable. Man wants to be God. And he succeeds. Nearly.2000 years later (and that year isn't a coincidence), you have David resurrected from the ice. Robots (yes, they're robots, not aliens) place him in a replica of his house, reminiscent of Dave Bowman in the cosmic zoo at the end of 2001. And what do we witness these robots do? That's right. They create humans. By taking the DNA found in a lock of hair, they regenerate David's mother Monica and grant him his wish.A lot of people thought this ending was corny. But think about it. These futuristic robots, who began as fledgling replicants when David was first manufactured, have now evolved into advanced thinking entities that desire to be like their Creator. Robots play Human if you will, the same way Professor Hobby and other men wanted to play God. This is original sin, The Fall as depicted in Genesis, all over again-- the defining characteristic of what separated Man from animals! Robots have become human, in every way.Like Kubrick's 2001, this film is open for debate and is even maddening at times, but remains one of the most profound commentaries on human existence attempted to be put to film in the last thirty years. Spielberg and Kubrick are geniuses, and I can't think of a better film to serve as a celebration of their collaborative efforts.I've defended this film for years now, and I've come to accept that I can't make a believer out of someone who doesn't want to. Few people who like the Jurassic Park Spielberg are going to be looking for this type of material. But if you're a Kubrick fan, consider that he was sort of a misanthrope. Spielberg is about the exact opposite. That's how this film was constructed-- an attempt to define real human love within a pessimistic view of existence.

If you can accept that, you may see that this is one of the more fascinating films ever made. Unlike any film since its most similar relative, 2001, it's a visionary odyssey filled with just as much philosophy as special effects.But effects aren't meant to be the show, and I fault Dreamworks for releasing it as a Spielberg summer film, because the public was waiting for the next E.T. when this was more a continuation of HAL the Supercomputer rather than that beloved Carlo Rambaldi puppet who carried around a potted plant with a healing finger.A.I. begins in a board room where Professor Hobby (William Hurt) challenges scientists with the notion of creating a robot that can mimic the most human of traits-- love. In this futuristic world, robots perform many tasks-- cook, clean, even provide sex-- all for their owners' pleasure. But Hobby says this is primitive, and a real proposition would be to create a robot that is essentially human. It's a new spin on the Gepetto story. To create a human, one must know what constitutes a human. And Hobby's answer is love, like a child's love of his parent.Thus comes the plot. David (Haley Joel Osment) is a prototype brought home by engineer Henry (Sam Robards) for his grieving wife Monica (Frances O'Connor) who has lost her son to disease. After a rocky start, this robot provides its owners pleasure and utility (like all machines do). But when the couple's real son is cured and revived, the robot is no longer necessary. Actually, it's a burden to keep. So they dump it in the woods.Let's examine this for a second. This is humanity at its grittiest. Humans are self-serving and sinful by nature, if we recall from the Genesis story of The Fall. We treat one another like objects, disposing of whatever displeases us or no longer gives us utility. Yes, we're that bad.Well, the movie doesn't stop there. It spends the next hour with David and Gigolo Joe (Jude Law in one of his strongest supporting performances) as they forge through the real world, with Joe teaching David harsh realities of existence and the dichotomy between robots and humans. Humans are emotional, and therefore dangerous. Robots do not have bias; they're programmed to do one thing, and they do it.That is, except David. And he exhibits the one trait other robots do not have-- Emotion. The yearning for things that do not exist. The desire to risk everything to chase after potential happiness elsewhere. While robots are resigned to their fate, David exhibits hope. In a remarkable journey through a Vegas-like city into a stark vision of a post-global-warming water-world that once was Manhattan, David finally finds Professor Hobby's office. He enters the workshop of his Creator, like man entering heaven, and what does he see? Not God. But thousands of other Davids, prepackaged in cellophane, ready for shipment. It's a haunting scene, a shocking realization that while we may desire God's love, we are not loved any more or less than every other one of His billions of creations. Was I the only one who found it utterly profound when David finally encounters the Blue Fairy (the entity he believes will make him a real boy)? The moment he touches her, she shatters into pieces! If you didn't, you may have never chased down a dream only to be shocked by the realization that the dream is just an illusion. (Consider that Teddy says we are in a cage when they're trapped under the ferris wheel while in pursuit of her.) I could go on... but I will stop with just one final point. Remember at the beginning of the film, you have Hobby and other scientists discussing how essentially to create humans... or at least replicas so close to human they are virtually indistinguishable. Man wants to be God. And he succeeds. Nearly.2000 years later (and that year isn't a coincidence), you have David resurrected from the ice. Robots (yes, they're robots, not aliens) place him in a replica of his house, reminiscent of Dave Bowman in the cosmic zoo at the end of 2001. And what do we witness these robots do? That's right. They create humans. By taking the DNA found in a lock of hair, they regenerate David's mother Monica and grant him his wish.A lot of people thought this ending was corny. But think about it. These futuristic robots, who began as fledgling replicants when David was first manufactured, have now evolved into advanced thinking entities that desire to be like their Creator. Robots play Human if you will, the same way Professor Hobby and other men wanted to play God. This is original sin, The Fall as depicted in Genesis, all over again-- the defining characteristic of what separated Man from animals! Robots have become human, in every way.Like Kubrick's 2001, this film is open for debate and is even maddening at times, but remains one of the most profound commentaries on human existence attempted to be put to film in the last thirty years. Spielberg and Kubrick are geniuses, and I can't think of a better film to serve as a celebration of their collaborative efforts.I've defended this film for years now, and I've come to accept that I can't make a believer out of someone who doesn't want to. Few people who like the Jurassic Park Spielberg are going to be looking for this type of material. But if you're a Kubrick fan, consider that he was sort of a misanthrope. Spielberg is about the exact opposite. That's how this film was constructed-- an attempt to define real human love within a pessimistic view of existence.

She sees teenage girls Juliet Hulme and Pauline (Reiper) Parker emerge frantically from the woods, covered head-to-toe in blood. It's Mummy! She's been terribly hurt! shouts Pauline. Meanwhile Juliet nearly collapses in desperation, crying PLEASE! HELP US! This is the opening of Peter Jackson's shocking, extraordinary film which effectively blends modern drama with fantasy and visceral horror. It's the gateway project that evolved Jackson from an inventive low-brow horror director (Bad Taste, Dead-Alive) to the premiere auteur of Lord of the Rings and King Kong. Speculate all you want about others, but he is this generation's Spielberg, a visionary filmmaker with ambition, depth, and a musician's ear for pacing. (One only wishes Sam Raimi of Evil Dead fame could have blossomed the same way).The film tells the tale of two 15-year-old girls, the socially awkward Pauline Reiper (a shy, chubby Melanie Lynskey) and the new girl in town-- frenetic, bipolar, and incorrigibly imaginative Juliet Hulme (an intoxicatingly charismatic Kate Winslet, in her debut). They're polar opposites, Pauline dreadfully timid and Juliet vivacious and without boundaries. It's precisely why they become inseparable and form an unhealthy codependency on one another, particularly since they lack other friends. Spending late nights dreaming up fantasy worlds and role-playing lascivious engagements with famous singers and movie stars, the girls become utterly ensconced in a world of pure illusion that no one-- especially their parents-- can tap into.Jackson takes this material and goes after it with full steam, complete with dazzling visuals like enormous butterflies, full-motion clay figurines, and CGI facial morphing-- all the more impressive in 1995, when CGI was just beginning to surface in cinema. But it's just as impressive to see Jackson carefully weave these innovative effects into a tale of adolescent jealousy without falling to the temptation of reverting back to horror\/fantasy. Not once does he show an effects scene where we lose tone of the story and feel like something is funny or gross for the sake of being so.It's precisely why this film works, and why the startling conclusion is so deeply disturbing. We know every element of terror is just fantasy until we encounter the real thing. And when it happens, we see it exactly the way Pauline and Juliet did. Horrifyingly. Here, murder is truly horrific in ways most of us would never want to experience in real life.This is one of those films I viewed without expectations, but discovered I couldn't turn my eyes away from it. I found myself fully alert, holding my breath, keeping my jaw from dropping throughout its 100 minute running time. The rigorous pacing by editor Jamie Selkirk, sparkling photography by Alun Bollinger, a spellbinding score by Peter Dasent, coupled with Fran Walsh\/Jackson's gutsy script and Jackson's energetic camera-work, instantly made me a fan of rogue art-house cinema.

The addition of several scenes, particularly ones where Pauline imagines gory ways to off her parents, do precisely what I felt the first cut restrained from doing. The original version is best because it takes itself seriously.And it ought to, because the crime, while fascinating, is no laughing matter. It's shocking, tragic, yet in many ways completely understandable. We spend a few hours getting drawn into the world of young Pauline and Juliet, and we can totally see how they've gotten seduced by their own spell.

The more significant conclusion to be drawn from Francis Ford Coppola's ambitious masterpiece is how the horror of war reveals the ultimate truths of our existence; how it exposes and illuminates the darkened shadows of the human psyche. The screenplay was adapted, very loosely, from Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness (1899) &#150; a novel not without its interest, but one that I found rather tiresome reading. Coppola transplants the story from the Congo jungle to the murky depths of the Vietnam War, which in 1979 still left a bitter taste in the mouths of American audiences. The allegory of a man, on the brink of madness, choosing again and again to pursue his own evil upriver is equally relevant in any setting &#150; Nicholas Roeg's 'Heart of Darkness (1994)' was, from what I gather, a more traditional retelling of Conrad's tale, while Werner Herzog's 'Aguirre, The Wrath of God (1972)' uncovered the darker side of Man in the desolate heart of 16th century Peru.We had access to too much money&#133; too much equipment. And, little by little, we went insane. Fresh from the phenomenal success of 'The Godfather (1972),' its sequel and 'The Conversation (1974),' Francis Ford Coppola was among the most respected filmmakers of his era. For his long-awaited next project, he decided upon 'Apocalypse Now,' then oblivious to the extent to which the film would crush his spirit. As grippingly documented in the unmissable making-of documentary 'Hearts of Darkness A Filmmaker's Apocalypse (1991),' the film's production parallels that of the story it depicts &#150; an intrepid director embarks on an impossible mission, its conclusion unknown, choosing against his better judgement to continue filming at any cost, risking insanity and financial ruin. A modest on-location shooting period soon ballooned into nearly 16 months; typhoons destroyed expensive sets; leading man Martin Sheen suffered a heart attack and battled alcoholism; the Philippine military frequently whisked away their helicopters to be used in active combat against rebel insurgents. It was Hell broken loose &#150; for Coppola, the apocalypse had arrived.The film's screenplay, by Coppola and John Milius (with Willard's memorable voice-over penned by Michael Herr), still retains many of the themes of Conrad's original novella, with Kurtz's distaste for British Colonialism replaced with his disgust at the needless hypocrisy of the United States' interventionism. Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) certainly isn't a typical war hero even at the film's beginning, he sits at the verge of breakdown. As he lounges in a sweaty Saigon motel room, Willard contemplates the seductive stench of a napalm strike, equates the beating of the ceiling fan with the muffled whirr of a military chopper; he craves the horrors of the jungle combat, and he's not alone. Many lesser war films are content to settle on the age-old cliché that war is hell, before hypocritically celebrating the overblown heroism of its brave soldiers. Coppola here does no such thing. In Vietnam, soldiers are mere pawns in this absurd, sadistic mockery of life and common sense; and war creates no heroes, but turns us all into monsters.Note the progressive dwindling of humanity as Willard works his way upriver. At the river's mouth, the laid-back Lt. Col. Kilgore (Robert Duvall) casually goes about his duties, launching an explosive aerial assault on a Vietnamese village (to the bombastic notes of Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries) purely because of the beach's ideal surfing conditions. This nonchalant fool retains enough compassion to bring water to a dying enemy soldier, but discards the canteen as soon as he notices the arrival of a famous American surfer. We progress upstream a love-sick mob of recruits overrun a USO show, a boatload of Vietnamese civilians are gunned down in a moment of panic, a final American outpost operates frantically without any form of command. By the time they reach Colonel Kurtz's (Marlon Brando) outpost in Cambodia, where natives have idolised him as a demi-god, Captain Willard and his remaining crew have shed every last sliver of humour, purpose and humanity. They progress, as in a drug-induced haze, towards the now-inescapable mouth of madness.Watching 'Apocalypse Now' &#150; particularly in the cinema, as I recently did &#150; was an extraordinarily invigorating experience, and I left the theatre with a cold chill down my spine. As a work of film-making, it is, to quote Colonel Kurtz, perfect, genuine, complete, crystalline, pure. Vittorio Storaro's on-location cinematography is completely breathtaking in its scope and immediacy, shifting gradually from the open-air theatrics of Kilgore's morning aerial assault to the closed, claustrophobic shadows of Kurtz's compound. At the long-awaited premiere, Coppola described his film, perhaps a tad pretentiously, as not about Vietnam, it is Vietnam; it's what it was really like. I'm inclined to agree. With respect to Steven Spielberg's accomplishments in 'Saving Private Ryan (1998),' I'd imagine that the human experience of war is not one of terrifying realism and clarity, but of a dream, the sensation of stumbling through a surreal carnival house of horrors. In the film's final moments, as that shadow of a helicopter flitters across the screen, we know that, wherever he goes from here, Willard will never truly leave the jungle.

For his long-awaited next project, he decided upon 'Apocalypse Now,' then oblivious to the extent to which the film would crush his spirit. As grippingly documented in the unmissable making-of documentary 'Hearts of Darkness A Filmmaker's Apocalypse (1991),' the film's production parallels that of the story it depicts &#150; an intrepid director embarks on an impossible mission, its conclusion unknown, choosing against his better judgement to continue filming at any cost, risking insanity and financial ruin. A modest on-location shooting period soon ballooned into nearly 16 months; typhoons destroyed expensive sets; leading man Martin Sheen suffered a heart attack and battled alcoholism; the Philippine military frequently whisked away their helicopters to be used in active combat against rebel insurgents. It was Hell broken loose &#150; for Coppola, the apocalypse had arrived.The film's screenplay, by Coppola and John Milius (with Willard's memorable voice-over penned by Michael Herr), still retains many of the themes of Conrad's original novella, with Kurtz's distaste for British Colonialism replaced with his disgust at the needless hypocrisy of the United States' interventionism. Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) certainly isn't a typical war hero even at the film's beginning, he sits at the verge of breakdown. As he lounges in a sweaty Saigon motel room, Willard contemplates the seductive stench of a napalm strike, equates the beating of the ceiling fan with the muffled whirr of a military chopper; he craves the horrors of the jungle combat, and he's not alone. Many lesser war films are content to settle on the age-old cliché that war is hell, before hypocritically celebrating the overblown heroism of its brave soldiers. Coppola here does no such thing. In Vietnam, soldiers are mere pawns in this absurd, sadistic mockery of life and common sense; and war creates no heroes, but turns us all into monsters.Note the progressive dwindling of humanity as Willard works his way upriver. At the river's mouth, the laid-back Lt. Col. Kilgore (Robert Duvall) casually goes about his duties, launching an explosive aerial assault on a Vietnamese village (to the bombastic notes of Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries) purely because of the beach's ideal surfing conditions. This nonchalant fool retains enough compassion to bring water to a dying enemy soldier, but discards the canteen as soon as he notices the arrival of a famous American surfer. We progress upstream a love-sick mob of recruits overrun a USO show, a boatload of Vietnamese civilians are gunned down in a moment of panic, a final American outpost operates frantically without any form of command. By the time they reach Colonel Kurtz's (Marlon Brando) outpost in Cambodia, where natives have idolised him as a demi-god, Captain Willard and his remaining crew have shed every last sliver of humour, purpose and humanity. They progress, as in a drug-induced haze, towards the now-inescapable mouth of madness.Watching 'Apocalypse Now' &#150; particularly in the cinema, as I recently did &#150; was an extraordinarily invigorating experience, and I left the theatre with a cold chill down my spine. As a work of film-making, it is, to quote Colonel Kurtz, perfect, genuine, complete, crystalline, pure. Vittorio Storaro's on-location cinematography is completely breathtaking in its scope and immediacy, shifting gradually from the open-air theatrics of Kilgore's morning aerial assault to the closed, claustrophobic shadows of Kurtz's compound. At the long-awaited premiere, Coppola described his film, perhaps a tad pretentiously, as not about Vietnam, it is Vietnam; it's what it was really like. I'm inclined to agree. With respect to Steven Spielberg's accomplishments in 'Saving Private Ryan (1998),' I'd imagine that the human experience of war is not one of terrifying realism and clarity, but of a dream, the sensation of stumbling through a surreal carnival house of horrors. In the film's final moments, as that shadow of a helicopter flitters across the screen, we know that, wherever he goes from here, Willard will never truly leave the jungle.

The more significant conclusion to be drawn from Francis Ford Coppola's ambitious masterpiece is how the horror of war reveals the ultimate truths of our existence; how it exposes and illuminates the darkened shadows of the human psyche. The screenplay was adapted, very loosely, from Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness (1899) &#150; a novel not without its interest, but one that I found rather tiresome reading. Coppola transplants the story from the Congo jungle to the murky depths of the Vietnam War, which in 1979 still left a bitter taste in the mouths of American audiences. The allegory of a man, on the brink of madness, choosing again and again to pursue his own evil upriver is equally relevant in any setting &#150; Nicholas Roeg's 'Heart of Darkness (1994)' was, from what I gather, a more traditional retelling of Conrad's tale, while Werner Herzog's 'Aguirre, The Wrath of God (1972)' uncovered the darker side of Man in the desolate heart of 16th century Peru.We had access to too much money&#133; too much equipment.

This sequel sticks out amongst a pile of 80's horror because our lead victim is a teenage boy, instead of the usual girl-next-door. No doubt, you've heard the debate -- probably read about it on this very site -- so I'll spare you. Watch the film and draw your own conclusions.Jesse Walsh and his family have moved to 1428 Elm Street, five years after the events of the first film, and right off the bat, the dreams start coming. Morning after morning, Jesse wakes up with an ear-piercing screech and a cold sweat. He also finds himself wandering in the late hours of the night, popping up in his kid sister's bedroom, his high school and even an S & M bar. It doesn't take long until he discovers the legend that is Freddy Krueger and what he has planned. It seems Ol' Finger-Knives wants into the real world and is using Jesse to get that job done. Whether it's his classmates, an overly cruel gym teacher or a parrot, it seems no one is safe until Jesse and his girlfriend Lisa put the legend to rest.Freddy's Revenge, although entertaining slasher fare, sticks out like a sore thumb with the rest of the series. Truth be told, they didn't know exactly how to do a Nightmare sequel at this point, and it shows. So you can't really hold the fact that this film doesn't cling to any mythos against the filmmakers. At the end of the day, it's a Freddy flick, and at the very least, it's different from the rest, which means you're likely to watch it more than a few times if you are a fan of the series. Most of the film lacks suspense, but doesn't skimp on the gore. There are some pretty nasty visuals in the film that warrant a view from any horror fan. Consider it a guilty pleasure. If you can get past the odd story-telling and the lack of substance, you'll have fun with Freddy's Revenge.

Truth be told, they didn't know exactly how to do a Nightmare sequel at this point, and it shows. So you can't really hold the fact that this film doesn't cling to any mythos against the filmmakers. At the end of the day, it's a Freddy flick, and at the very least, it's different from the rest, which means you're likely to watch it more than a few times if you are a fan of the series. Most of the film lacks suspense, but doesn't skimp on the gore. There are some pretty nasty visuals in the film that warrant a view from any horror fan. Consider it a guilty pleasure. If you can get past the odd story-telling and the lack of substance, you'll have fun with Freddy's Revenge.

No doubt, you've heard the debate -- probably read about it on this very site -- so I'll spare you. Watch the film and draw your own conclusions.Jesse Walsh and his family have moved to 1428 Elm Street, five years after the events of the first film, and right off the bat, the dreams start coming. Morning after morning, Jesse wakes up with an ear-piercing screech and a cold sweat. He also finds himself wandering in the late hours of the night, popping up in his kid sister's bedroom, his high school and even an S & M bar.
