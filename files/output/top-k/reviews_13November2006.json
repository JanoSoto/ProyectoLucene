Most moviegoers of the time would know this as a smash play, an absolute hit.Our hero is a drama critic, so off the bat, we are set up to be inside and outside of the thing at the same time. This is exploited less than you would imagine, which is surprising since every other comic device is so overused we resent it. The use of this is twice. There's a scene where our character is with some bad guys; he doesn't realize the threat. During the time that he is sneaked up on and captured, he is describing a play he has seen where the main character was so dumb, he was in a house with murderers, he doesn't get out in fact he sits in a chair like this and gets tied up. At which point he gets tied up, of course.The other use of this device is during a fight. Our hero retires to the stairs and remarks on the fight as if he is watching a play.Elsewhere the general theme of plays is used a bit. Two characters have scripts that they want our hero to read.

Jokes are made about this that would have been funnier in the play which featured Karloff himself in the role.There's a character who is crazy, so plays the role of Teddy Roosevelt.

In addition to being a famous drama critic, our hero has written several popular books debunking marriage, more specifically the romance associated with marriage. Its an apt thing for an observer of the artificial to note that romance is mostly a scripted illusion.

This is, by far, the best role I have ever seen Sean Penn play (along with I am Sam). He nails the role, doesn't glamourize his actions while doing so. He manages to maintain a level of debauchery throughout the movie that I think was very important. Up until the very end, he does not try to be seen as anything more than what he is. He is a sick man who regrets his past, but still makes excuses for it. He ends up able to redeem his sense of self-worth as much as a convicted (and guilty) murderer can through the aid of Susan Sarandon's character, Sister Helen Prejean. Her character taught me about good will towards others without making me forget how horrible a person's actions can be and without making excuses for them.The supporting cast was also top-notch. I was surprised to see a small cameo of Jack Black in this film given the funny-man he has become today! I loved this movie for both personal reasons and just because it was a work of cinematic art.

When I first watched it, I was just beginning what has become a life-long passion for justice. It gave an interesting perspective of the death penalty and also gave me a few things to think about.When you have a cast like this one, you are right to assume it is going to be nothing short of fabulous. This is, by far, the best role I have ever seen Sean Penn play (along with I am Sam). He nails the role, doesn't glamourize his actions while doing so. He manages to maintain a level of debauchery throughout the movie that I think was very important. Up until the very end, he does not try to be seen as anything more than what he is.

A notable subtle aspect such as the touching of one's hat brim in front of the brow with the right hand as a display of respect and compliment. This was a commonly performed function.The language is prominently gracious, elegant and superior. It demonstrated a period of times with exceeding consideration. Such language, its dialects and delivery still exist today in a few areas, even here in Kansas but more so in Southern areas still reverent to the real issues of the Civil War. Some of this is mentioned in other reviews.The funniest moment in the film is the discussion where Holt is offered Turner's bacon. His reply was, I could eat more. When Jake Roedel received the same offer from George Clyde, he was told, Well, I'll ---- it out by the oak tree tomorrow and you can help yourself.There is historical accuracy about the founding, and the reason for Lawrence is sound. Topographically it is less than 15 miles from the slave Capitol of Kansas which existed in Lecompton. Proximity to the issues was an everyday point suffered by both sides as it was dangerous to be known as showing allegiance to either side.This dangerous discord in Kansas spilled over into the issue of its coming into the Union on one side or the other.

The exchanges with Pitt Mackeson between Jake and her switch rapidly from confrontation and memory of past events and pronouncements to a more civil conversation, almost forgiving in which Jewel's acting skill carries much of the heightened anticipation of the next series of exchanges, what they may be and what their content will promote.Others have spoken remarkably accurate about the portrayals by other actors.I don't know of another film which addresses this period and location.

I have enjoyed Martin on two occasions in Little Shop of Horrors and in Novocaine. Mysteriously, he plays a dentist in both films, which I will dismiss as a coincidence.I was asked to watch this film by a young woman who could not sing its praises high enough, so I readily agreed to see if Steve Martin had another film I could tolerate. I am pleased to say, this film was very funny and quite charming in some ways.From the very beginning, the humor is a little offensive by today's standards, which I welcome. Martin, who is obviously white, has been raised in a black family from Mississippi and never realized something was wrong. This comes back later in the film, but already in the beginning we know things are going to get crazy.The jokes come from situations that are completely ludicrous and have no linear connection. There's a sniper who really hates these cans (probably the best part of the film), to the idea that being in the phone book can make you famous, to a scene where a certain household pet is treated inhumanely for our amusement... and top all this off with a song about a Thermos.

After 2 hrs I started fast forwarding the film and still could not finish it. It has got to be the longest film I have ever seen in my whole life or not seen. There are lots of interesting things but I found the film trite and banal. The amount of money spent on this film is just unthinkable. There are a few scenes which are nice but most of the film is basically a road-side show where people do what ever it takes to entertain you. There is a character that keeps breaking bottles on his head. I am yet to figure out what it signifies. It wasn't entertaining I can say that at least. A dancer keeps getting drunk, keeps removing her clothes and keeps dancing. I have no idea why she does that.

He was so good, that I actually stood up and clapped at the end of the movie when I watched it in the movie theater. Seriously, you gotta watch it to understand and agree with what I'm saying. Elijah, being so young, yet SO much more talented than a lot of older actors these days. I dunno...its like he was BORN to play Frodo Baggins...that's how good he is. Elijah, if for some reason you get around to reading this, know that you're my HERO. I wanna thank you for coming into my life. When my world gets dark, I know I can always turn to you.

Whilst the comedy has little edge and is fairly simple, it is the charm and innocence that induces laughter and the lack of political correctness is also refreshing in a time where political correctness has gone mad. The character of Mr Yunioshi is a prime example of politically incorrect humour that would probably get a film banned these days! The plot is very good as we follow a deeply narcissistic character with a very complicated background through her chaotic lifestyle which is being threatened by a serious relationship with Paul (pre A - Team George Peppard).The acting is very good from the leads, although somewhat static compared to modern actors. Rather than static, subtle might be a more appropriate word (except for Mickey Rooney as Yunioshi) as the actors do provoke certain emotions from the audience. By any standard, Audrey Hepburn is a great actress and is someone you immediately want to fall in love with, in spite of the fact she plays such a peculiar character who is far from perfect. Every aspect of Holly Golightly is played to perfection by Hepburn as she shows a great range of emotions, each juxtaposed against one another. Despite her narcissism, she is very likable and when her usual apathy is challenged by her feelings for Paul, a great transformation is witnessed on screen. Audrey is quite simply perfect and with this film, her beauty will last forever. George Peppard gives a likable performance as the infuriated Paul. He garners a great deal of sympathy from the audience as we watch him bang his head against a wall for an hour and a half until his emotional speech at the films climax. Martin Balsam in a supporting role is also good and it is nice to see him in a more humorous role after watching him in 12 Angry Men and Psycho. His phone conversation with Paul is amusing and probably one of the 'non Audrey' highlights of the film.Breakfast at Tiffany's won two Oscars for music and this is due to the touching score that compliments the action perfectly. Moon River is a very sad piece and this is very effective in highlighting Holly's sad past and how unhappy she actually is, despite her illusions that she is very happy. The direction is also very good as we are given a subtle film delivered at a surprisingly fast pace so it doesn't become boring for one second. As I said before, the plot is very good and the small twists, turns and sub plots do a great job at making you think. Truman Capote did a fantastic job at writing such an accomplished novel. His great story thoroughly deserved to be immortalised on the silver screen. The only question I have to ask is, how did such a screwed up guy write such a beautiful story?Slated by some as a mere chic flick of the 60s, Breakfast at Tiffany's is much more than this as it is an emotive, thought provoking story played to perfection by the two leads and offers so much more than a couple of giggles. Never before has a cat appeared so poignant in a film (excluding of course Garfield) and it is small quirks like this that make the film so special.

I like the music at the beginning and the end. I think the boy, Jaime's obsession with airplanes is funny, especially when he sits in a crashed plane pretending to be a fighter pilot. I like unique stories such as this one. I also like all of the details it shows about the Chinese people and Japanese Army, such as the tanks close up. The only part that is too sad for me is that a really gorgeous blonde lady (Mrs Victor played by Miranda Richardson) dies. I like Jaime's comments about the atomic bomb. The way Jaime finds his parents at the end is so sweet to me, but may also seem sad to other. Overall the movie is so wonderful.
