Recently I also went back and reviewed Risky Business, NL's Vacation and a few other 80's movies and so I'm kind of going to try and compare it to its contemporaries. Anyway, I'll kick this off by asking a few question No 1 - Where do you think Ferris wound up in life after he graduated from High School? Another question might go like this If you liked Ferris, how would you compare your life now to that of someone who didn't like Ferris?. THere is a polarization of attitudes here at IMDb over him, and so these would seem to be relevant questions.And so to begin with, as has often been pointed out over the years, the biggest issue with Ferris for many was that he was made of Teflon - i.e. nothing stuck to him. I think that this was due in part to the fact that he got so much love and attention from his parents that he never considered the possibility that others might not also love him. This in turn made him feel impervious to wrongdoing and caused him to do morally questionable things ) Another issue is that he came from that part of society where parents are powerful enough to bully school administrators whenever they feel like it. Witness Ed Rooney's shivering in his boots when he thinks he's talking to Sloan Peterson's Dad. So, Ferris moral compass is a bit skewed, and if you have any teaching experience, you have probably seen this all before.Now, contrast him to buddy Cam and maybe Joel Goodson of Risky Business. Cam and Joel, in contrast to Ferris, had moral consciences. Where Ferris would just sort of go out and do something whenever he felt like it, Cam and Joel were more restrained and prone to weighing pros and cons. All of these differences to me were related to each character's relationship with his parents. Only Ferris seemed to take his parents (and their love) completely for granted. And where Cam would say I don't know what I'm going to do with my life, it shows you that at least he's thinking about it. Joel Goodson was also on a career path at the time his story takes place. But Ferris? Does Ferris ever talk about what he wants to do with his life? No, not that I can recall. So, I ask myself all of this because I am no longer 18 and am not that successful in life. I also got a kick out of skipping class when I was in high school, and didn't like to talk about what I wanted to do afterwords because I didn't know. And......I always pretty much loved this movie which has perhaps caused me to be blind to its message. And just what was the message?Well, a good movie will take you on a journey, a journey in which the principal characters change. Well, but the problem as I look back on it now is that Ferris DIDN'T change that day. Cam did, and Joel did in Risky Business, but Ferris learned only that, once again, deceitful and impulsive behavior results in no consequences. This was perhaps the movie's message, that Ferris was some sort of God or something and well, just don't try this at home kids! Sounds like I really didn't like him, heh? Well, but i DID! I'm not one of those Ferris haters. But I gotta admit, of the three characters I'm referring to, he's the one who's going to have the most issues to deal with later in life, IHMO!And so the irony to me is that Ferris was the catalyst that caused Cam to grow up and face his fears, but it was really Ferris that needed a catalyst, not Cam. Catalysts cause other things to react and change, but don't change themselves. This was the Teflon aspect of Ferris's existence. He didn't project any sense that he needed to work on himself, to grow. Perhaps unconditional parental love is not always a good thing then, and Ferris never appreciated how good he had it. Guys like that can get you in a lot of trouble because they have few moral boundaries owing to that love. I don't know, but remember that the motorheads, dweebs, wasteoids, dickheads, etc all loved Ferris. That left Ed and sister Jeanie to lead any attempts to burst his bubble, to catalyze any change in him. They don't succeed here, but maybe they planted some seeds in his brain? So wake up and smell the coffee, Ferris. Cam's dad's is going to find out that you really wrecked the car, not Cam. And then your reputation is going to be the next hot topic around town.....OK, OK......there, I've said it. I've made my peace with myself and with Ferris. Yeah, we love you, and I'd still pluck my money down to watch you outsmart Ed Rooney and the whole town of Chicago. But if immortal youth is the only God in this universe, you've got some years of reckoning ahead of you. That is unless of course, you drift into theatre, acting, comedy, or are independently wealthy. Because I guess I still don't know what you were really planning on doing with YOUR life? What skill sets were you going to bring to the rest of world? Well, you might have made a pretty good houdini....

There was, apparently, a technical reason for this connected with copyright law, but some viewers and reviewers took this form of title as an indication that the film would be more faithful to the original book than previous attempts to film it had been. Such an expectation was to be disappointed in the case of something like the eccentric William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet (definitely Baz Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet rather than Shakespeare's), but here Kenneth Branagh does try and remain more faithful to the original than those old Boris Karloff adaptations from the thirties. (Branagh was so keen on authenticity that he even retained the love between Victor Frankenstein and his adopted sister Elizabeth, something which seems far creepier today, even though they are not related by blood, than it probably did in Shelley's day. The main part of the story takes place in the 1790s, the decade when the French Revolution was at its height, and when revolutionary fervour threatened to overwhelm the rest of Europe. There is no direct reference to these events in the film, but the period is certainly an appropriate one, as young Victor is aiming to bring about a revolution in the scientific sphere far more radical than anything attempted by the likes of Robespierre and Saint-Just in the political sphere. Victor has been obsessed with death ever since his mother died giving birth to his younger brother, and vows that he will use his scientific studies to find a way to conquer death. He comes to believe, from his study of the works of alchemists, that it is possible to create life by artificial means, and persists with his experiments despite the warning of his teacher Professor Waldman that they can only end in disaster. He eventually manages to create a being by piecing together parts from various human corpses and to bring it to life by means of electricity.Branagh not only directed but also starred as Victor, one of two remarkable performances in this film. In this version Frankenstein is not a mad scientist holed up in some spooky old castle, but rather a young student at the University of Ingolstadt. (This was at one time one of the most famous universities in Germany, but it closed in 1799, only a few years after the story is set). Nor is he some nerdy or unworldly intellectual, but rather a passionate young man whose two great passions are his love for Elizabeth and his belief that his work will confer great benefits on mankind. This is a highly physical performance; we get to see plenty of shots of Branagh's naked torso, emphasising his character's passionate nature. The other outstanding performance comes from Robert De Niro as the Monster, or The Creation as it is referred to here. The Creation is, a hideous, deformed creature, yet at first its impulses are gentle, kindly ones. If is only when it is rejected by humanity that it becomes murderous, vowing revenge on mankind in general and in particular on its creator, who has bestowed upon it the unwanted gift of life. De Niro was an actor who made a sensational start to his career in the seventies, starring in films like Godfather II and Taxi Driver, and although his reputation has perhaps suffered somewhat since as a result of his appearing in too many inferior movies, he nevertheless retains the power to shock us by some electrifying performance. King of Comedy, The Mission and Cape Fear were all examples of this power, and Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is another. He manages the difficult feat of making The Creation both frightful and pitiable. Despite the late eighteenth century setting, this is no work of heritage drama in the Merchant\/Ivory style. It is rather a visually dark film, one which dwells on the squalor of the past rather than its splendours. Even the scenes set in the elegant Frankenstein family home are rather gloomy; Branagh clearly intended to give it a look which matches the tragic and violent events which make up its plot. (Shelley's novel can be seen as an exercise on Gothic horror as well as pioneering science fiction). Mary Shelley does not perhaps rank as highly in the modern pantheon of English literature as her husband Percy, but she does at least have the distinction of having created in Frankenstein one of the great myths of modern times, a story which is known to millions who have never read her original novel. (I am here using the word myth in William Golding's sense to mean not a falsehood but a truth which can only be told in the form of a story). The familiarity of that story is, of course, mainly due to the many film adaptations, although it must be said that some of those were not very faithful. Kenneth Branagh, however, deserves credit for making a film which respects the intellectual and philosophical complexity of Shelley's original.

I would not rank it quite as highly as some of his great Shakespeare adaptations, notably Much Ado about Nothing and Hamlet, but it runs them a close second. 8\/10 ","genre":"Drama, Horror, Romance"},{"date":"22 December 2012","score":"5 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":" I watched this based on having read many positive reviews.

Rififi was one he'd gone on about for years, so finally I bought it, first for him, then me to watch after him. It's fair to say the old man got it right again and when I say right, I mean dead right.This, quite simply, is one of the most compelling and exhilarating films I've ever seen, everything you could want in a gangster movie. I say gangster movie, but you could throw other epithets at it too, like revenge thriller, heist movie, film noir and more, it defies button-holing and is all the more remarkable when you consider when it was actually made. It's very adult in its themes and still seems remarkably up-to-date today with perhaps only its treatment of women dragging it back to its source decade.Otherwise it's violent, sexy and realistic with the ensemble acting as good as anything I've seen in a movie. Dominating proceedings is Jean Servais as Tony, the jailbird scheming supremo in a performance of sustained determination, his hangdog expression rarely changing as the movie progresses. His three confederates give able backing while the female actresses also shine, with Tony's ex-girl and girlfriend candidly shown in states of undress five years before Hitchcock shocked America when filming Janet Leigh in her brassiere.Filmed in a brooding black and white, often in the Parisian rain, it literally drips atmosphere and features many memorable shots (the death of Cesar at Tony's hand, the kidnapped child's mother running to the camera in her anguish and more), while the centrepiece is of course the celebrated 30 minute dialogue-free scene of the robbery itself, where you forget you're watching actors and instead feel like you're witnessing closed circuit TV before its time. The camera-work is fluid throughout, the pacing of the narrative just right and the downbeat conclusion wholly apt.I recommend admirers of crime movies to find a way to watch and get absorbed in this remarkable film.

Anyway, this movie is often a fan favourite of many of my friends. Ever since one of my classmates in English class began singing Hakuna Matata, often to annoy me, I have been analyzing this movie and trying hard not to make any fan of this movie mad at me.But I'm getting sidetracked. While the animation (and artwork in general) is astounding and clearly had a lot of effort put in, I find that the story seems to have not as much effort put in.Based on the Shakespeare play Hamlet (and Kimba the White Lion, but I'll get to that later), this film revolves around a lion who, after losing his father to his envious uncle Scar, is convinced to remember his past and that HE should rightfully claim the throne. I like the message that the past can hurt and you can run from it or learn from it, but I feel a lot doesn't work for me.For example, the plot (as I mentioned before) is derived from two great works of fiction. It wouldn't bother me as much if the end credits said Based on Hamlet by William Shakespeare and Kimba the White Lion by Osamu Tezuka or if Disney didn't tout it as an original story.Then there's one of my biggest issues with this movie, this movie doesn't know if it wants to be for younger children (3-6) or older children (7-12). While it does deal with mature subjects such as the death of a loved one, responsibility, handling guilt etc, there's too much other stuff in this movie that's immature.It goes without saying that when a protagonist experiences a tragic turn of events, the first thing we want is something that will cheer us up afterwards... for many, Hakuna Matata comes to mind, but... for me, I think there could have been a better way of accomplishing that.Speaking of which, I find only three of the songs from this movie worth listening to, Circle of Life (kudos to Hans Zimmer), Be Prepared (who doesn't admire a song as awesome as this?) and the end credits version of Can You Feel the Love Tonight? (Gotta listen to more Elton John, though). As you might have guessed, Hakuna Matata, while it may have appealed to me some 6-7 years earlier, is now the song I hate the most from this movie. It just blows my mind that a movie like this goes from a lion cub witnessing the murder of his father by a jealous uncle to one of the most annoying and whimsical songs I have ever heard as well as belching and flatulence jokes... see what I mean when I say it's not very clear on the audience it wants to appeal to? I am in disbelief that the guy who wrote songs for Princess Diana's funeral actually wrote a song as annoying as that.Also, there are scenes in this movie that are too intense for younger children, such as the death of Mufasa, the hyena chasing Simba and Nala, Simba and Nala (grown up, and before they recognize each other) fighting and the climax. I would strongly recommend waiting until your kids are 6 or 7 years old, or if they understand how hard it is to handle the death of a loved one.But what I really like about this movie is the father-and-son connection between Simba and Mufasa, which is one of the reasons why you're supposed to find it sad when Mufasa dies, just like why we're supposed to sympathize with Bambi when his mother dies. Whenever you watch Mufasa and Simba conversing happily, you just know there's a connection between the two.Overall, this movie is not bad, but not everything is flawless, and this is no exception.

Trying to get laid when the world is burning down certainly isn't going to put the blaze out.Truly though, this is a 2nd hand future little Georgie Lucas would drool over, everything pointlessly amped up to the 9th degree, a maze of wheezing, malfunctioning machinery & petty bureaucrats abusing the small say-so allotted them. Bystanders attempt to live terrorized lives while the state clumsily pounces round with well meaning storm troopers & well-spoken tyrants asking you politely to sign on the dotted line (everyone here is sooo polite despite the terrible things they do).I wouldn't have actually thought such a world possible until recently, confirming that yes indeed, people will let the organs of state extend around their squirming bodies if it means more comfort. I wonder what the people who lived behind the iron curtain would make of this one. Maybe they could give us Westerners some tips?

His obsession with the (Needlessly?) bitchy Helena is questionable and for some reason there are scattered allusions to some kind of tainted past with his mother.

This movie tries, for some reason, to scatter erotica around too. There's a far too long slow motion scene where Helena gets undressed and jumps in a fountain at a party. You know, like you do. A scene from nowhere, where Dr. Nick has sex with a completely random and nameless woman to entertain Helena, who apparently reaches some kind of climax by watching this despite the fact that at this point in the movie, she can't possibly do that by herself. To top it all off it ends with - I'm not kidding you - Oh, it was all a dream. DO NOT waste two hours on this flick, even if the plot sounds as intriguing to you as it did to me.

Only a very small amount of slapstick humour (which I didn't find amusing while others kind of did), but that's not enough to keeping the whole movie occupied. It was so incoherent that it provided me with the most unpleasant and embarrassing experience I've ever had watching a film.The plot is unimaginable and incomprehensible. Fred is a complete idiot who ruins and humiliates Elizabeth (Phoebe Cates, Gremlins I & II), the main character's life. I mean if you're seeing an imaginary friend you either can't see it or its hallucination. He makes her throw a bin of yellow slimy stuff at her Nan. I would hardly recommend any viewers under 5 to watch this. It could teach them bad manners. If you're watching this pile of puke right now I'd warn you to turn it off, get away from toddlers banging pans together and smashing dishes, go into the bathroom, look into the mirror (cover your face with water), clear your mind and think about something completely imaginable (I know it sounds strange but it's just a warning from me).Now this is a film where the actors\/actresses go way over their heads. Once DD Fred causes embarrassment, all the others main actors on the set go bonkers. At one point Liz has coffee with a chap named Mickey Bunce, a date kind of thing, which Fred wrecks as always, causing Bunce to go nuts. I couldn't get my head round it. Martha Mason plays the mother of Liz, Polly Cronin. She's completely unhinged over Fred. It's like she wants to abandon her child on the street. She traps him in a wooden box and wraps it in cello tape, causing young Liz to end up in tears. There's another thing I don't get Why would Liz let loose a mental maniac from the box years later when she's wants to get on with her unstable life (to try and make it better) and it's going to make her life more unstable? If I was her I would just leave him there to suffer and then throw the box into a dump compactor(probably what I should do with the DVD).Now as Drop Dead Fred provides nothing to recommend, I'm starting to think why it was made this way. It could have been a kid's movie. What I mostly think of this is why it was even made. I can't believe it's not on IMDb's Bottom 100 list and why anyone would even like this.

Any parent would be appalled with the entirely childish and occasionally inappropriate content. I spent most of my experience trying to figure out a way to get out of the place.

This movie features everything a western should love, gun slinging, plot buildup, and an exciting climax. That combined with the wonderfully and tastefully done music makes for a true western watch. However, I give it 8 stars because I have a couple of complaints. Keep in mind that this is coming from the perspective of a 16 year old that did not grow up with westerns movies being very common among modern culture. To sum it up, the rising action of this movie was too dragged out for my taste. It simply took too long. A decent portion of the buildup was not very meaningful; it contributed little to the plot.

With the exception of Peter Cushing as Grand Moff Tarkin and Alec Guinness as Obi-Wan Ben Kenobi who were already well established actors, Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, Harrison Ford as Han Solo and Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia were unknown actors that became household names because of the popularity of this movie and everyone plays their parts well.

Max is a highway patrol cop and the film opens with the highway police chasing a ganger known as the Knightrider. Max wins when he causes the Knightrider's car to crash, thus killing him, and then he earns the enmity of the rest of the gang, who go on to kill his wife an child, and that them makes him really mad.This was the movie that pretty much made Mel Gibson a star, and the financial figures are quite impressive, particularly for an Australian movie. It cost them around $68000 to make and earned in total $100 million. Once again I guess car crashes sell, and particularly since Mel Gibson was an unknown actor at that time, that was really the only thing that they could use to promote the movie. Oh, by the way, Gibson isn't strictly an Australian since he was born in the United States, but it is because he studied at an Australian film school, and made his first appearance in Australian movies is why people consider him an Australian actor.When I first saw the movie I was a little disappointed because I was expecting something a little more post-apocalyptic, namely because that is what the second and third films were, but the idea in this film is that society was beginning to break down, gangs were roaming the highways, and petrol was becoming a scare commodity. At the time that the film was being made was near the end of the oil shocks of the 1970s, and apparently there were petrol riots breaking out in Australia. However these days I find the whole idea of fighting over petrol in a post-apocalyptic setting is somewhat silly because as a commodity, petrol would be a lot further down the scale than food or water.The low budget nature of the film does show out somewhat, particularly since it seems to be a bunch of car chases and car crashes punctuated by some attempt at character development. There is one scene, in the Halls of Justice, which simply did not make much sense at all, though one can gather that it did involve some crooks being let off from some charges that they have attempted to bring against him. However the fact that there is an established police force, and a court system, is clear that this film is not post-apocalyptic, but rather set in a civilisation that is in decay.

After all, this movie really has a host of actors I think are great, the Gyllenhaals, Drew Barrymore, Noah Wylie, the late, great Patrick Swayze, Mary McDonnell, even Seth Rogen, although his part is minuscule.Well, I'm sorry to say, this movie wasn't any better the second time around. In fact this movie stunk, but I wouldn't say it was the actors fault. In fact all of the actors did a very fine job. No, this movie is bad because of the writing. For the life of me, I don't know what was the point of this movie. Was it teenage angst? The dangers of medicating our teenagers? I'm sure there is some symbolism involved, maybe the creepy rabbit is some modern dark version of Jimmy Stewart's Harvey? The best think I could say about this movie is that its creepy and I can dig that. If it goes somewhere, like in David Finchers, Seven and The Game or even Jacob's Ladder (which I think is a horrible movie with a great ending)No, this movie keeps you disoriented almost from the first frame to the last one. I'd love to try an explain it to you, but I need someone to explain it to me first. I didn't tell the video clerk that I thought it was bad. Why bother? He loved it.
