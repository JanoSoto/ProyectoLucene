[{"date":"13 March 2008","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Requiem for a Dream is not an uplifting film in any way. Nor does it have a traditional story line, so if you don't like movies like that, then don't watch this. If you're looking for a good drama, this is it. I felt glued to the screen at times.Four people live their lives addicted to drugs. Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto) is a heroin addict and lets the drug take over everything. His girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) loves her boyfriend, but she'll do anything for the drugs. Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) is a friend of Harry, who wants to live the way his mother wanted him to, but can't quit the substances either. Sara Goldfarb, played by the wonderful Ellen Burstyn, is the mother of Harry, and just wants to lose some weight. She begins an addiction to diet pills, and a dream to be on a TV infomercial. All four of these stories are sad, and all four are amazingly written and acted. Ellen Burstyn is the stand-out actress. Every scene she was in, I was sucked in. Her acting is amazing in this. The direction is great, and the cinematography is beautiful.This great drama reaches near perfection, and should be touted as a classic, as it seems to be by it's cult following.My rating *** 1\/2 out of ****. 100 mins. R for sexuality, language, drug use and violence.
