The only thing that stands between William and his dream of becoming the World Champion is bad boy Count Adhemar. And when the two rivals go lance to head at the world finals to determine who will be named the ultimate champion, you better arm yourself and hang on tight for the thrill ride of your life! according to the DVD sleeve summary.Birthday-suited Paul Bettany (as Geoffrey Chaucer) very obviously steals the show. Richard Greatrex' camera-work is an asset.Filmmaker Brian Helgeland and his regulars do make A Knight's Tale the stylish, exciting, action-packed adventure promised. Yet, in what was to be his star-making lead, Mr. Ledger shows little of his later acting depth. As his romantic interest, Shannyn Sossamon is just beautiful - almost enough to make you believe Ledger would risk his life and reputation to prove his love; she's quite demanding. Helgeland's contemporary scripting is amusing, but the soundtrack oldies and farting coda drag it down.***** A Knight's Tale (3\/8\/01) Brian Helgeland ~ Heath Ledger, Paul Bettany, Rufus Sewell, Shannyn Sossamon ","genre":null},{"date":"16 May 2010","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Heath Ledger is William Thatcher, a peasant squire who breaks all the rules when he passes himself off as a nobleman and takes the jousting world by storm.
