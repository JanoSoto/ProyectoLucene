Whenever I watch films of this nature I typically feel like I have seen the story time and time again. A mismatched couple finds love together, only to have some tragedy befall them by the end of the film. It is the classic Pride & Prejudice scenario mixed with a blend of Wuthering Heights. It is sad because for a very long time Hollywood couldn't release a film that redefined the genre. Most viewers avoided these types of films because of the cliché nature coupled with the dull, monotonous acting that could only be accomplished by a short-list of actors. To me the genre is painful, but this film doesn't seem to fit within that age-old mold. What makes this film stand out from the rest within the genre is the fact that screenwriter John Sweet gives us deception and intrigue with our characters, coupled with a story that you would see in typical mainstream cinema. While it may be based on a true event, Sweet's story, coupled with the decent eye of director Charles Shyer (of Baby Boom fame) gives us a modern twist instead of the stale comradery that this genre is commonly used to.What makes this film stand out is that Shyer doesn't hide anything from us. This can be both a positive and a negative because it doesn't keep you guessing until the end. You know what is going to happen, it isn't sympathetic in nature, but instead demonstrates the power of the human desire and the corruption of the human need. What I found interesting about this film is the contrast between the class that Swank tries to fit within and that of the upper class citizens of Versailles. All that she wants is to be a part of her family's history, which is that of wealthy and social standing, while it is that upper class that ultimately destroys the reputation of France. Swank's character Jeanne is shown to become a symbol of the common class, but in reality she is just trying to reach up into a wide open sky. The struggle then becomes rather confusing as Shyer wants us to feel sympathy for the obvious villain (Pryce) or are we to feel sympathy for the central character, Swank, which commits evil deeds for her own self righteousness. While some will argue that this is a downfall to the film, I kind of enjoyed it. I liked seeing my mind flutter between the two, knowing that one seems evil and the other is evil. It was creative for this period piece to see the story unfold from the eyes of the thief instead of the savior. This worked until the end, when Shyer demanded sympathy from us and, in my case, found none. By the end, I could not care what happened to Swank because she had it coming to her all along, from the beginning we see her mind reacting to situations, and this one happened to put her in the hypothetical hot seat. It was this internal struggle with this film that really made Shyer's outing stand apart from the rest in the genre.While I would agree with most film critics that Swank is an actress that is not afraid of sinking her teeth into a role, I did feel that this singular role was not made for her shoes. Swank seems silly as Jeanne, attempting to bring a level of emotion to a character that felt more snobbish and jealous than honest. Her smile, her actions, her sex-appeal just wasn't prevalent in this film, nor did it work. This was her first feature role after Boys Don't Cry, and I think that Shyer really just wanted to ride the Oscar bandwagon, without thinking further within his character. Pryce is &#133; well &#133; Pryce. If you have seen one of his period piece films, then you have seen him in this one. I think directors know he looks like someone from that period, so he is instantly cast. Simon Baker is a decent choice to play the gigolo; he seems to have the smile that could melt women. Adrien Brody seemed to come out from left field for this film. He is a great actor, but he was used as a classic reveal in this film. A surprise known actors comes in during the center of the film to bring viewers out of the possible sleep they could be facing. Christopher Walken, a actor that I believe rules this generation of cinema, was odd in this film. I kept waiting for him to yell, COWBELL, this film needs more COWBELL. He wore a strange mustache and odd hair, but was fun none the less. Alas, Antoinette herself could have been better played than through the eyes of Joely Richardson. While she may be a decent actress, this was just too goofy for her. While I loved Sweet's story, it was Shyer's choice of casting that really hurt the overall sensation of this film.Overall, I could suggest this film to friends and family. I thought, outside of the performances, that the cinematography was beautiful, the change of direction from your normal period piece drama was a breath of fresh air, and that Shyer did a decent job of placing a new spin on a tired genre. There are some major sparks to this film, but it just didn't light a full fire in my eyes. The addition of Alanis Morissette's hypnotic voice to the opening and closing to this film added a strong undertone that set the pace for the rest of the film. It was a strong film for Shyer; redefining a genre is smart, but he could have strengthened his directing arm a bit more by adding crucial actors to better roles and a less empathy towards the true villain.Grade *** out of ***** ","genre":null},{"date":"5 November 2006","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" The Affair of the Necklace is a surprising film for one that falls within the dreaded period piece genre.

Yes, it would seem that originality wasn't high on director john Dahl's priority list when it came to making this film, although he does appear keen to buck as many clichés as possible, and the nail-biting tension that features often more than makes up for the lack of originality anyway. The plot focuses on Lewis; a young man travelling across the desert to meet up with his friend Venna. However, on the way to see her he ends up getting saddled with his prankster brother Fuller, and it's not long before the brother has bought a CB radio and is starting to wind up the local truck drivers. They come across a man calling himself 'Rusty Nail' on the CB, and after playing a prank on him, the pair find that the truck driver doesn't have a very keen sense of humour...There are some really great sequences in this film - from the many chase scenes, all the way down to the hectic and exciting climax - Roadkill is an entertaining thrill ride throughout. The plotting is surprisingly engrossing, as the film focuses on the two central characters for most of the running time, before shifting gears half way through and adding an extra character into the mix. The acting is superb considering the cast members. I saw Paul Walker for the first time in the lamentable thriller The Fast and the Furious - and he really shouldn't have made it, as the kid has talent and that is shown in this film, as well as in the surprise 2006 hit 'Running Scared'. Walker has great chemistry with the brash Steve Zahn, and the victim side of the cast is rounded off by Leelee Sobieski, who in fairness; doesn't have a lot of time to impress. The real standout, however, is Ted Levine, whose uncredited voice is that of the central villain. Overall, along with director John Dahl's previous films The Last Seduction and Rounders - Roadkill is a film that hasn't got the respect it deserves. Highly recommended!

It doesn't help that the primetime schedules are full of versions of Alex Cross in TV series mysteries but generally this film just plods its way through a story that isn't obvious so much as it is uninspiring.

The twists come but the film is not exciting enough to prevent the audience from thinking and, in thinking it is easy to rip massive holes in the logic of the whole thing &#150; and thinking a plot is a bit silly doesn't help keep one interested. Tamahori directs without any distinction &#150; he isn't bad but again he doesn't do anything of that much interest.Instead he sits back and hopes that Morgan Freeman doing Morgan Freeman's Zen-cool&#153; will be enough to carry the audience along with the whole affair. Luckily for him this does work to some degree because Freeman on his day could sell shoes to fish. He is solid and professional even if he is underserved by the script. Wincott is good in a role that he could have made more of but instead is controlled and restrained. Potter is blond and dull and is not suited one jot to the role that her character grows into during the film. Baker deserves a bigger role while Miller, Horsford and a few others provide familiar faces.Overall then an entertaining but uninspired affair that pushes the right buttons but doesn't aspire to anything beyond the genre. The cast and the budget help but the story gets weaker the longer it goes on and although it will do enough for some viewers, it is nothing that special.

As far as I am concerned, it was a very good video game-based movie, and an entertaining zombie flick. Let me break it down.Story Alice, a woman with no memory, is brought into a world she doesn't understand when a team of paramilitary commandos take her down into a research lab to aid them. Apparently, the entire lab was wiped out by the area's supercomputer, entitled Red Queen. Their mission is to wipe out the supercomputer, and determine the cause of why everyone was killed. The trouble is, a deadly virus was released through the facility, and the people that were killed are still walking around. Resident Evil is a film about conspiracy and scientific experiments gone horribly wrong.Direction Paul W.S. Anderson, in my opinion, is a fine director. He knows exactly what he wants to achieve in each film, and sets out to do it. Anderson knows how to build up the audience, and submerse them into a film. The pacing of the film is terrific, with just the right blend of action and horror. Anderson can work wonders with a budget, and knows how to set up the mood for the entire picture, and keep it that way. Solid! Rock on, Mr. Anderson.Acting This was the part where the film faltered. While not horrible, the acting isn't top par, either. Milla Jovovich(Alice) played the part of the amnesiac quite well. She was definitely the finest actor in the film. The girl has talent. Michelle Rodriguez(Rain) played her usual tomboy no-nonsense character almost as good as usual, though something was missing in this performance. Eric Mabius(Matt) did a poor job. His performance was just not believable to me. James Purefoy(Spence) is a gifted actor, and I look forward to seeing him more often. As for the rest of the cast, some were good, some were poor, and some just plain sucked.Score Marilyn Manson and Marco Beltrami composed a fantastic score for the film. Their combined efforts really helped set the tone for the entire movie, and fit in so well with what was going on. I loved it.Violence Unlike most zombie flicks, this film is not extremely gory or revolting. The zombies shed very little blood, because, as stated in the film, it has already coagulated. Still, there are a few bloody bits. We get countless head shots, gunshot wounds, decayed zombies, some creature violence, and a particularly nasty segment with a laser.Profanity\/Sexual Themes Of course, cussing is found in this film, though I must say, it is almost always justifiable in the flick. As far as sexual themes, there are two very brief sex scenes between Milla Jovovich and James Purefoy, with a brief glimpse of nudity on Milla's end.Substance Abuse None.Overall By the end of the movie, I found myself thoroughly entertained.

But then I watched it. The beginning is fairly normal, Peggy Sue (Kathleen Turner) goes to her high school reunion and is complemented by her peers, even though she feels her life is a wreck because of her cheating husband. She wishes she could go back and do things differently, and when she wins the title of class queen, she faints, and wakes up in 1960.She soon realizes she actually does have the chance to make some changes in her life, and starts out trying to break up with her boyfriend whom she will marry in the future, Charlie Bodell, played by Nicolas Cage. But she keeps falling for him, even though she experiments with going out with the town poet, treats the class nerd better and asks for his help in getting back to her time, and tries to develop a better relationship with her sister.In the end, she gets back to her time to realize not much has changed, and she ended up marrying Charlie. But now she realizes she can't go back and merely fix her past problems, she needs to work them out with herself and her family.The entire film is very entertaining and feels a bit like Back to the Future, only less flashy and more serious. I enjoyed all of it, but a part near the end, involving Peggy Sue's grandfather and his lodge friends sending her to 1986, is very strange and a bit out of place. All of the actors do a great job with their roles, Kathleen Turner received an Oscar nomination, but I think Nicolas Cage does the best job. It's hard to tell if his character is genuinely in love with Peggy Sue, or if it is just a teenage infatuation, but in the end he tells her how much he wants them to work things out. Some people may find his voice strange and annoying, but I found it at times funny and sad, and it made his character seem just like the adolescent he is. He gives a truly Oscar worthy performance.Overall, Peggy Sue Got married is an excellent drama with some great comedic moments.

This film starts where the original film had left off. It's twenty-two years after Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) went on a killing spree, and was locked into a mental institution for his split-personality. Now, he's been released and deemed stable enough to live a normal life. But things don't stay too normal. Norman returns to his house and the Bates Motel, and gets a job at a local cafe where he meets Mary (Meg Tilly), a nice young woman whom he gets close to. The townspeople still assume Norman to be crazy, but Mary trusts him. Soon enough, more killings begin to occur, and Norman begins to lose it again. Has mother returned, or is there something else going on that he isn't quite aware of? Surprisingly, this movie turned out to be a really good sequel. We get to focus in even more on Norman Bates, flawlessly played by Perkins who keeps us sympathetic but a little skeptical about his character. At first the audience kind of feels bad for the guy - he's ridiculed and harassed at his job, and everyone still thinks he's nuts. But when people start dying, we get a little suspicious, although the killer is never clearly shown in the murder scenes, so we really have no way of telling if he's really snapped again. The acting was all really good here too, Meg Tilly played her character and made her likable, and Vera Miles even reprised her role as Lila Loomis, Marion's sister from the original Psycho.This film is remarkably more violent than the first film, and doesn't think twice about showing us knives going through people's mouths and whatnot, so in that respect this movie is different from the original. Not only that, but this film is in color, so there's another difference, but the color\/non-color differences don't really make a barrier between the two movies. The ending to this movie was a shock for me, because it took me completely off-guard and I wasn't expecting what the screenwriters had in store for me. But I think that's a good thing because it made it completely unpredictable. All things considered, this movie was very well-written.Overall, Psycho II is about as good a sequel you're going to get for a Hitchcock film.

That it also is something a lot simpler than I remember it being from when I was a kid is not totally surprising, though maybe just on the characterization-front. I saw it so long ago that I only remember some specific things- the natives riling up themselves to give their sacrifice to their 'Kong'; the big ape fighting the T-Rex; the director presenting the '8th wonder of the world' on stage and then Kong breaking out of the chains. Some of those images are indelible in the realm of old-time classic cinema, and I would always recommend this one, particularly to kids who may feel like 'bah, black & white isn't for me', as it contains some of the finest entertainment of the period, if at least in great spurts.If I do see anything though in watching the picture today a little unsettling it's that the director, Merian C. Cooper, is actually setting trends both good and bad for future blockbusters of this kind. The level that the characters- the three main ones being Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong), Jack Driscoll (Bruce Cabot), and Ann Darrow (Fay Wray in her most recognizable and flat-out entertaining work)- work on is one that is of the utmost simplicity, so much so that there really isn't anything beyond the most basic, untouchable points. Denham is ambitious, so much so that he will go to any length to get his next picture made, or if not, get fame other ways. Driscoll is hard-headed, the more courageous of the bunch, and doesn't really like women until he meets Ann. But even with Ann, who does exude a little bit of dimension in an otherwise screaming and frightened performance, there isn't much that she can get out of Jack here. In remembering then too about what Peter Jackson's King Kong had with the characters, I realized that- at least in part if not overall- there were some improvements made in terms of dealing with and getting involved with the people on screen on one hand.But, on the other hand, this IS a monster movie, after all, and what would it be without convincing scenes of action, suspense, thrills, and all that wrapped up into the best special effects and animation of the period? It's here, really, that I can sense what attracted Jackson to make his own version of the picture. Though what's interesting to me in having seen both now fairly close in time to one another, is that I really enjoyed and got engrossed in the animation of this film just as much, if not more, than in Jackson's interpretation. In fact, I would say that if there is any case of the style totally trumping substance, it's in the scenes with Kong on the island and then also when he returns with Denham to New York City. The stop-motion is crude, but then that's really what's so fascinating and cool about it, and it actually does work in a kind of spectacular way with the cheaper thrills thrown in. I loved the fights he had with all the creatures, but even in quieter moments- however few- it was just amazing to see the quality of Kong's fur and face move, how much it kind of contorted and went around this way and that, and then of course with the whole body.So in some crucial ways, King Kong is a marvel of action-based movie-making, where the thrills and, I suppose to, the characters are meant to be as simple, direct, and plain as day as possible, but at the same time the technical aspects are meant to dazzle them and make them glad they paid for the ride. While I might be one of the few out there to overall prefer Jackson's much more ambitious epic that takes all the good ideas here and stretches them out, there are some other things though in this film that still make it a landmark on its own. Kong here isn't a creature that might possibly get 'attached' or fall for a human, and is really just there to tear at anything it gets in its way or tries to stop it from having 'his' woman, and in the end he becomes one of cinema's most endurable bad-asses.

Some of those images are indelible in the realm of old-time classic cinema, and I would always recommend this one, particularly to kids who may feel like 'bah, black & white isn't for me', as it contains some of the finest entertainment of the period, if at least in great spurts.If I do see anything though in watching the picture today a little unsettling it's that the director, Merian C. Cooper, is actually setting trends both good and bad for future blockbusters of this kind. The level that the characters- the three main ones being Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong), Jack Driscoll (Bruce Cabot), and Ann Darrow (Fay Wray in her most recognizable and flat-out entertaining work)- work on is one that is of the utmost simplicity, so much so that there really isn't anything beyond the most basic, untouchable points. Denham is ambitious, so much so that he will go to any length to get his next picture made, or if not, get fame other ways. Driscoll is hard-headed, the more courageous of the bunch, and doesn't really like women until he meets Ann. But even with Ann, who does exude a little bit of dimension in an otherwise screaming and frightened performance, there isn't much that she can get out of Jack here. In remembering then too about what Peter Jackson's King Kong had with the characters, I realized that- at least in part if not overall- there were some improvements made in terms of dealing with and getting involved with the people on screen on one hand.But, on the other hand, this IS a monster movie, after all, and what would it be without convincing scenes of action, suspense, thrills, and all that wrapped up into the best special effects and animation of the period? It's here, really, that I can sense what attracted Jackson to make his own version of the picture. Though what's interesting to me in having seen both now fairly close in time to one another, is that I really enjoyed and got engrossed in the animation of this film just as much, if not more, than in Jackson's interpretation. In fact, I would say that if there is any case of the style totally trumping substance, it's in the scenes with Kong on the island and then also when he returns with Denham to New York City. The stop-motion is crude, but then that's really what's so fascinating and cool about it, and it actually does work in a kind of spectacular way with the cheaper thrills thrown in. I loved the fights he had with all the creatures, but even in quieter moments- however few- it was just amazing to see the quality of Kong's fur and face move, how much it kind of contorted and went around this way and that, and then of course with the whole body.So in some crucial ways, King Kong is a marvel of action-based movie-making, where the thrills and, I suppose to, the characters are meant to be as simple, direct, and plain as day as possible, but at the same time the technical aspects are meant to dazzle them and make them glad they paid for the ride. While I might be one of the few out there to overall prefer Jackson's much more ambitious epic that takes all the good ideas here and stretches them out, there are some other things though in this film that still make it a landmark on its own. Kong here isn't a creature that might possibly get 'attached' or fall for a human, and is really just there to tear at anything it gets in its way or tries to stop it from having 'his' woman, and in the end he becomes one of cinema's most endurable bad-asses. Worth revisiting if not seen in a while, or if not seen at all worth it to see what does stick. 9.5\/10 ","genre":"Adventure, Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"5 November 2006","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" There are a few things I would like to signalize(1)Marnie has a delighting score by Herrmann,his usual musical richness that fits so well Hitchcock's aesthetics;I have estimated Marnie by rubrics,if I may put it that wayHerrmann,Connery,Dern,Mrs. 'Tippi' Hedren,as well as the show's texturethe alienation,the sinister,Hitchcock's compassion.It is known,I guess,that Marnie is the last Hitchcock movie with a Herrmann score.After that,Truffaut tried to take over,and indeed had Herrmann for a couple of shows.Herrmann is one of the most endearing personalities in the cinema's history.His music is so rich,compelling,fluid.With Herrmann,Hitchcock secured the best music for his films.(2)Marnie has a certain stylistic resemblance with Vertigo, the aesthetic contents of the two movies are kindred.It also has some thematic similitude with Family ...,but the resemblance ends here (the latter being made in a comic register).Hitchcock's movies offer so many themes to be reflected upon,deepened.(3)As in the coming Topaz (1969) ,in Marnie (1964) the woman's glamor is a peak themein a bedroom scene,when Connery,exceeded,suddenly undresses Mrs. Tippi Hedren,there is a richness of fascination that could not be matched by any nudity.In Hitchcock's movies,the women's charm is not a (merely) filmed one,but a lived,a felt one,a very lively perceived one,not a convention,but a deeply concrete experience.(4)Hitchcock's compassionate depiction of Marnie's life is striking,and very sincere and intense.

So on the whole I did enjoy this movie and I think it was a worthy addition to the chainsaw movies...how they went from this to the mess that was four is beyond me as I thought that one was terrible with no redeeming values. I will say that part two was more bloody too as it had a very good head chop scene...the ratings board most have been really picky in the late 80's and early 90's as this one isn't nothing compared to the two new remakes and yet they had to tone this one down.

This is a pretty long and violent journey but boy is it worth it.The final 30 minutes of the film are tremendous and the final shoot out grips with tension.I remember the first time I saw it and couldn't believe that Clint could possibly leave poor old Tuco to hang in the middle of the graveyard and even though the character of Tuco is a bit of a swine I was really pleased Clint decided to save him after all.Watch this movie.Not only is it a great western,it is a fantastic film in it's own right.

I prefer it to the other four films in the 'Exorcist' series (I include 'Dominion') and, shock of shocks, I think it is the scariest. Superior in every possible way to 'Exorcist 2,' it is William Peter Blatty's TRUE sequel to 'The Exorcist.' Watching one right after the other is optimal since 'Exorcist 3' does assume that you have seen and understood the first film.That George C Scott was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award is completely laughable and a sure sign that the Raspberry committee is far less clever than they think they are. Keep in mind that 'Exorcist 3' had three major things working against it when it was released1. The legacy of 'The Exorcist' which is still rightly viewed as a landmark of the horror genre (whether or not it is still scary for a more contemporary audience is another matter) 2. The legacy of 'The Exorcist 2.' The sequel was such an hilarious disappointment that it inflicted terrible damage to the credibility of the entire series. Fans who might have given part three a chance had already walked away from the series. 3. 'Reposessed' the Linda Blair 'Exorcist' spoof had been released just prior to 'Exorcist 3.' It sent up the entire series and harmed the chances of a genuinely intense and rewarding horror film.There are scenes in 'Exorcist 3' which have haunted me for years. Very few horror films do that. The scene with the night nurse checking rooms is one of the scariest things I've ever seen on film. Or how about the ceiling walker? Or how about the nurse at George C Scott's home?Brad Dourif very nearly steals this movie and I wonder how the role and his performance would have been looked at if there had been no 'Exorcist 2' and if 'Exorcist 3' had come out a year earlier than 'Reposessed'? I was mesmerized by him every time he was on the screen and he has a very long and difficult speech in the middle of the film. It is a masterful piece of acting and the intensity is incredible. The anger and the power within him slowly crescendos and just as it pushes George C Scott's back to the wall in the cell, I defy an honest viewer not to be pushed away from the screen as Dourif looms into it, closer and closer, slashing a simulated knife back and forth and raging out his dialogue with lines that tremble just short of yelling. Dourif has been largely under-rated after early success in movies like 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,' and 'Ragtime.' His work here is among the best he's ever put in and nobody has watched the film or taken it seriously. Dourif suffered a terrible injustice by not being more widely recognized for his performance here. I can not praise him highly enough and I hope that some of his more recent success with projects like 'Deadwood' will send fans back to earlier examples of his work.George C Scott is another favourite of mine and I really love what he does in this film. Scott can fairly be accused of often looking like he was impatient on screen and tolerating another actor's lines only so that he could deliver his next brilliant speech. I loved him for it though and have enjoyed every performance of his that I've seen. That he is accused of poor acting here is truly mind boggling. Consider the scene where he comes to the hospital to visit the sickly Father Dyer. He begins with a calm tone that slowly becomes more agitated with each line. He is believable and true. He is concerned and worried about his friend. When he yells WE'RE FINE! at the nurse, it isn't because George C Scott the actor is blowing the scene. It is because Kinderman the character can't hide his stress and concern any longer. The same goes for later on when he realizes, in a panic, that he needs to get home FAST. I love the way he behaves as the passenger in the squad car. This is the face of desperation and Scott was absolutely correct in how he played it.Studio interference with the Nicol Williamson infused exorcism are the only flaws in what is otherwise a very good horror\/supernatural thriller. Scott and Dourif are both excellent and in a very limited role, so is Jason Miller. It has two scary moments that I will remember forever and it is a much better film than people give it credit for being.

Daniel Day-Lewis makes for a totally believable hero and his love interest Madeline Stowe looks fabulous and makes you believe that she is worth fighting for. With stunning scenery,fabulous music and very slick direction from Michael Mann,this is a jewel of a movie that will appeal to blokes as well as women.Give it a try,I reckon you will be impressed.
