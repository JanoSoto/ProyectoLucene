Airport sounds good. Bummer! I'm sure I've recorded it to VHS at least once, but I can't find it.So now, I'm just thinking about the movie and all of the things that have changed since, and maybe because of, Airport. Airport was released in the summer of 1970, a decade after the dawn of the Jet Age, but also the sunset of the Golden Age of flying.In the summer of 1970, my brother and I flew from Atlanta to El Paso, carrying our rifles on board the airliners with us. I was 17 and my brother was 13 that summer, but just like the summer of 1967, which is when we started our annual unaccompanied trek to and from El Paso, nobody paid much attention to the two of us carrying rifles through the Atlanta, Dallas (where we changed planes), and El Paso Airports. When we boarded planes, we always asked the crew where we should stow our rifles. American and Continental pilots usually let us give them the guns so they could safely keep them in the cockpit, but Delta crews usually told us to just find a place in the back of the coat rack. (Overhead bins were virtually non-existent in the 1960s.) In the summer of 1970, when Airport came out, no PAN AM airplane had ever been blown up over Lockerbie Scotland. In the summer of 1970, no one had ever heard of D.B. Cooper much less of anyone threatening to blow up a passenger plane in midair if a ransom was not paid. 9\/11 meant nothing in 1970.In the summer of 1970, we certainly didn't have metal detectors at airports. Can you imagine my brother and me walking through a metal detector in 1970 with our rifles? Beeeepp! Hey, hold it up right there boys. You set off the metal detectors! Oh, I'm sorry Mr. Security Guard, but I think it's just these two rifles and our pocket knives. Well, I hope that's all! We don't want you trying to sneak any of those beatnik Peace medallions past us . . . or anything else that you boys know you shouldn't be carrying . (Whoopee Cushions? Straws?) Oh no sir, it's just these two rifles and our knives. Okay boys, go on. Get out of here. Have a nice flight. Finally, in the summer of 1970, flying wasn't glamorous, but it was still a somewhat pleasant experience. The lobby of the theatre that was showing Airport was decked out to look like an airport. I can't remember for sure, but I think our theatre tickets came with boarding pass jackets. I do remember that the signs in the lobby pointed, not to the theatre entrance, but rather to the boarding gate. The theatre was trying hard to once again make flying seem glamorous.In many ways, Airport was similar to the 1950s movie The High and the Mighty (substitute a pistol for a bomb and a partially-detached engine for a cracked fuselage and you've got the same in-flight drama), but The High and the Mighty, perhaps because in the early 1950s we lived in less of an activist, knee-jerk, 60-minutes and 20-20 asking probing questions type of world, did nothing really to change flying.The Crowded Sky (1960) came out about midway between The High and the Mighty and Airport, but, unfortunately, its story of a military jet crashing into a passenger plane was hardly new. Let's see, in the real world an F-89 collided with a DC-7 in January of 1957 over Southern California. An F-100 collided with a DC-7 in April of 1958 over Las Vegas, and a month later, over Maryland, a T-33 collided with a Vickers Viscount. Combine those three military\/civilian accidents with the earlier, and even more horrific 1956 United\/TWA mid-air collision over the Grand Canyon, and you can understand how the U.S. Congress was able to pass, and President Eisenhower was able to sign, a new Federal Aviation Act by August of 1958. That Act brought about the Air Traffic Control system that Arthur Hailey wrote about in the book Airport, and that the movie Airport, at least partially, showed.I'll admit that I was too young to know or care about the 1958 Act when I was watching The Crowded Sky, but I had heard of some of the real-life mid-airs, and I just assumed that everything that could be done was being done to prevent future accidents. I'm also sure that, other than a few squeamish movie-goers canceling their future air-travel plans when they walked out of the theatre, The Crowded Sky played no major role in shaping or changing public perception of aviation. It told us what had been, not what was to be.Things really changed after Airport, though.I can only wonder what flying would be like today if D. O. Guerrero hadn't set off that bomb in Airport.

Howling 4 is still the second worse. Read my review on that for more details.) And like I said in my Howling 4 review, just because that was awful didn't mean I would be put off from finishing off the series, but now that I've stumbled upon this abomination, I'm becoming more reluctant. Remember back in the 80s when VHS covers where awesome and imaginative? Yeah. Howling II had a very awesome cover for when it was first released on home video in the 1980s, and to be truthful, for 8 years, I had been wanting to see this movie, especially since the movie's theme song got stuck in my head. Then in 2005, it finally came out on DVD, uncut (The original VHS was cut, from what I understand.) Unfortunately, I was treated to a really crappy cover which slightly mocked the cover of the original and 3 years later, as a well as a very crappy movie. Now that I got that off my mind, let's move onto the movie. The movie revolves around Ben Brown (The brother of Karen from the first Howling. In this one, there's no Dee Wallace Stone, but some extra playing Karen) who's approached by a werewolf hunter, Stefan Crosscoe (Played by the great Christopher Lee, who must have needed the $$$$$), who claims that Karen has in fact, become a werewolf. So then, Ben, Jenny (His Girlfriend, who has the have the 2nd worst acting in this) and Stefan go to Transylvania, where Striba, The Werewolf Queen (Played by Sybil Danning. Okay, I like Sybil Danning, but her acting was horrible in this. The acting she did in those old Adventure Video Segments in the 80s were better than this, and in those, she intentionally acted poorly) resides. And I will also say that I definitely agree with HorrorMan. There were some extremely sick moments in the film, like, obviously, the werewolf sex scenes, the worst of them being this one scene with Sybil in the middle between these 2 other werewolves, apparently trying to kiss each other, yechh. And not only is it sick, it's also pretty ridiculous as well. And a very stupid part in the movie was the midget with the exploding eyes. The movie is also pretty boring, as the film's main song plays over and over and over. Overall, the film is just simply abominable. I also agree with HorrorMan on the factor that it's hard to believe that people could get away with calling this a horror movie, or god forbid, a comedy, as it ain't scary, and it's certainly not funny either. Other people seem to see this as a so-bad-it's-good-film, and that's perfectly fine. I'm pretty much the kind of guy to enjoy a so-bad-it's-good-film, but in the case of Howling II, this movie is so abominable, not even MST3K or RiffTrax would make this movie any better. The biggest WTF moment in this movie had to be the ending. And the worse part, like I previously stated in the Comments Section for HorrorMan's review of this movie, I paid only $3 for this at BigLots...and that's all it's worth. Avoid this movie like the plague, and like Howling IV, I wish I could give this a zero, but it's not a valid rating on either Amazon or IMDb, so a 1 will have to do.

I said almost. Christian Slater plays Clarence, an Elvis loving, Kunfu watching, comic bookstore nerd. He meets a hot blonde hooker named Alabama played by Patricia Arquette and they fall instantly in love. The film is written by Quentin Tarrantino, a former video store nerd himself, and his touch is unmistakable. The plot twists as Clarence kills Alabama's former pimp and steals his drugs causing a chain reaction of events involving the Detroit Mob and the police. It's amazing how many characters Tarrantino writes for in his films and how much depth and complexity they all have. The supporting players such as Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, Brad Pitt, and Chris Penn offer some of the most memorable moments in the film most notably a discussion on the origins of the Sicilians. The performances are all very solid especially Gary Oldman as the dread locked pimp, Drexl. He transforms into the character with such detail it's hard to recognize any noticeable traits of the actor on screen. So the acting is great and the script is incredible. Where could it go wrong? The direction of the film by Tony Scott for me brought the film down a few notches. The entire movie felt very claustrophobic. There were way to many close ups that had no motivation at all. In the final shootout he cuts from one close up to another of people shooting and guns. It's hard to tell who is who and where anybody is. Its action movie film-making and overdone.

A childhood favorite. Granted that it still has it's flaws. My friend says the reason this movie gets blasted all the time is because he thinks this was made mainly to exploit Jamie Lee Curtis' career, since she had been in movies like Halloween and The Fog. The movie starts off in 1974. A group of kids are playing hide-and-go- seek in an old school building when all of a sudden, one of the kids falls to their death. The other kids vow to keep quite about it, but one of the kids knows. Flash forward 6 years later, the kids are now in High School. On the night of their senior prom. What they don't know is that a masked killer is stalking them. The main problem with this film (which is the REAL reason why so many people hate it) is because of how long it takes to get to the killings, which don't happen until the last minute (Bad move there, I'm afraid), and the kills aren't even close to perfect, but enough about that. Overall, there were some parts that creeped me out, some parts that bored me, and some parts that made me laugh, especially the scene where one of the girls mooned the nerdy janitor. Another one is of course, the cheezy disco music. So if you're a horror fan who has a lot of paticience and likes cheezy slashers, this is for you. And on the topic of the remake, just forget about that. It was so awful, it's hard to believe it ended up #1 at the box office. The power of horror, I suppose.

The films success spawned a sequel in 1999 and a second sequel is to be released in 2010.The story is about the cowboy doll Woody who is the favourite toy of a boy named Andy. Woody and the rest of Andy's toys all live together in Andy's bedroom, but Woody is the only one who is allowed to sleep in Andy's bed. Woody's position feels threatened when Andy receives a new action figure, an astronaut Buzz Lightyear, for his birthday. Because of Buzz Lightyear's fancy special features, Buzz replaces Woody as 'favourite toy'. Woody grows more and more jealous as the other toys accept Buzz into their community, and see him as some kind of leader because of his special features. When Andy decides to take Buzz on a family outing and not Woody, Woody feels offended. For revenge, Woody tries to trap Buzz behind a desk so that Andy will be forced to take Woody instead. However, Woody accidentally knocks Buzz out of the window, and the other toys see this as an attempt to murder Buzz. Woody is ostracised by the other toys. Woody does get taken on the family outing with Andy but unbeknownst to him, Buzz hops aboard the car as it leaves. During the outing, Buzz and Woody both become separated from Andy, who accidentally leaves them behind when he goes back home. Buzz and Woody must put aside their differences and work together if there is any chance of getting back home.The animation of Toy Story is very impressive. The animators use very effective cinematic techniques that make you feel as though you are watching a live-action film rather than an animation. Toy Story was ground-breaking as this level of entirely CGI animation in a film had never been done before, and CGI in films had only started being used widely a few years earlier. The characters of Toy Story act and move like real people, and give the impression of having realistic weight. The animators get the effect of light with precision, and the animation barely feels out dated at all; modern animation do not necessarily seem any more advanced than this film. Unlike cartoons such as The Simpsons, the characters of Toy Story are based on human features. They move about as though they have the same body parts as humans.Toy Story is a brilliant film in my opinion. It works on many levels so it can appeal to all people aged between 3 and 90. As far as its animation, it was absolutely brilliant for its time, and, as I said earlier, holds up very well today. The story is sharp and entertaining, full of hilarity, from toilet humour to dry wit; anyone will be able to find something funny about this film. The characters are also very lovable and the viewer feels attached to them in the first few minutes. I would definitely give this film a good four stars out of five.

Only four of the original numbers were retained. The replacement music, credited in the titles to Roger Edens, is serviceable enough but simpler and decidedly more brash, and as such it detracts somewhat from the character of the original. In particular the absence of such numbers as 'What's more I can cook' and 'Some other time' is highly regrettable. It seems odd to me that that having done the maestro such a disservice the film was still awarded a music Oscar in 1950. Nevertheless it remains a highly entertaining romp &#150; how could it fail with a cast that includes Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra, Betty Garrett, Ann Miller and Vera-Ellen. It's just that it could have been even better.For anyone who wants to find out what Bernstein's original score was like, there is a live recording of a semi-staged performance of the musical made in London in 1992 with the London Symphony Orchestra under Michael Tilson Thomas and a magnificent cast of singers including Thomas Hampson and Frederica von Stade. The only thing you don't get is the dancing! It is available on CD and hopefully a few copies of the video may be knocking around. Unfortunately it seems that no DVD was ever released.

In the particular case of this character what turned her into this state was her obsession with the TV show and her loneliness. The other characters were drugs and their ambition to make money. Nevertheless in both cases there's a dream that becomes a nightmare because of their loss of control.

It is also nice to have a leading lady who, while pretty, isn't an exotic, unrealistic beauty like we tend to get in another spy franchise.

Unfortunately for him he is spotted and his CIA bosses assume something is wrong with him and attempt to arrest him when he visits the US consulate. He escapes and pays a German girl (Franka Potente) to drive him to Paris. They realise just how much danger they are in when an assassin attacks them in Bourne's apartment. From then on he must play cat and mouse with the CIA and the French police until he can finally identify and confront his former employers at the end.The acting is solid throughout, both from the two main characters and from secondary characters, especially Clive Owen in a small roll as another assassin sent after Borne.

Many have been made since this one. But this is the one that almost all others pay homage to, if not outright steal from. This is the one that first set the bar way back in 1925. And amazingly, though many have tried, few have matched or exceeded the storytelling potential first mined in this movie. The original clocked in at 106 minutes or so, the version I own from runs 93 minutes and is considered the most complete. The cut down version of 60 or so minutes is not recommended.I watch this movie for historical enjoyment, not to watch it with the expectation of watching a great movie. It is not because this is a silent movie (there are several silent films I think are great), it is simply that the story lags in places and is a little loose in others. Even with that caveat, this is an amazing movie. According to the original 1925 souvenir program, 'It took six times longer to produce this picture than any other production in film history, for it was more than seven years from its inception to completion. It is in this spirit, of this movie as a pioneering accomplishment of imagination, that I enjoy it so much.The movie is based on a book written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The book is great fun and is well worth reading. Much of the spirit of the book is present in the movie. For the movie a female character and a romantic triangle are introduced. I can't think of any Lost World type movies that have failed to include a female love interest, it is that compelling and necessary in this genre. However, in this movie, the love triangle is tepid and somewhat dull. I suspect some of the lost footage is tied to the trading post scene, where a love ballad is supposed to be sung. Maybe that footage would have helped deepen the romantic triangle. I doubt it. But if the love story falls flat, the characters of Challenger and Roxton are perfectly cast, perhaps never since equaled. The constant and hilarious bickering between Challenger and Summerlee, one of the delights of the book, is at least represented in this movie.But it is the stop motion dinosaurs that justifiably make this movie famous. So many movies have failed to come even close to the bar set by these dinosaurs. This is their coming out party in a major film. They look great, as if they jumped out of one of the fabulous paintings of Charles R. Knight. They are active, quick and powerful. They fight and kill with gusto and ferocity! These dinosaurs are true tyrant lizards, unapologetic masters of their world. And at the end, with the brontosaurus swimming out to sea, we know that the true primordial can never be contained or tamed.The setting for the movie is a wonderful combination of paintings, miniatures and actual jungle footage. And there is so much setting to play with - an inaccessible, forgotten land, intricate caves, skulking man-apes, primitive tribes (in the book, not the movie), lost explorers, volcanoes which threaten to destroy everything, and of course, the hope that something could be brought back.This is a must see movie for all fans of the lost world genre.

Everything about this movie keeps you captivated. The characters do an impressive job. Ewan McGregor is convincing as the starry-eyed idealistic poet who falls in love with Satine. He sees nothing but her, and his face lights up when she walks into the room. Nicole Kidman does a decent job in her role as well, although all she has to do is be gorgeous and tantalizing. Towards the end of the movie, she does pick up her game and presents a haunting portrait of a woman who knows she has doomed herself to a life of torment without her love. Both of them do fine as singers. I am sure their voices were touched up a lot, but who cares? The supporting cast is great as well. The Duke sneers effectively. Jim Broadbent as Harold Zigler is great as the manager of the Moulin Rouge. He is a kind man, although his first love is his theater. He truly is sorry he has to ask Satine to sacrifice herself, but not sorry enough that he is willing to see the Moulin Rouge go bankrupt. He has a great number towards the end called The Show Must Go On. My favorite supporting actor by far has to be John Leguizamo, a Baz Luhrmann regular. He plays the dwarfed version of Toulouse-Lautrec well and represents all that glitters in the Bohemian. He believes in truth, beauty, and love and wants everyone around him to have all 3 if possible.The music is breathtaking. I always cry during the Come What May at the end of the show. And the look of the film is just beautiful. It makes the Moulin Rouge look like a beautiful carnival of sound, color, and melody.The pacing is just right. I understand that Luhrmann has a background in opera. This truly shows in his ability to make powerful use of the music mixed with the pictures. He has knowledge of how to play his audience. I was also impressed with how he created just the right mix of tragedy and comedy. During Act II, a very dark act, he throws in a light number, Like a Virgin, which provides needed comic relief. There is also the stunning dance number Roxanne, which makes effective use of the montage technique using scenes from both the dancers and the turmoil happening upstairs in an erotic tango. He truly builds tension to the breaking point.I highly recommend this movie for a romantic evening, a girls' night, or as a pick me up.

Jim Broadbent as Harold Zigler is great as the manager of the Moulin Rouge. He is a kind man, although his first love is his theater. He truly is sorry he has to ask Satine to sacrifice herself, but not sorry enough that he is willing to see the Moulin Rouge go bankrupt. He has a great number towards the end called The Show Must Go On. My favorite supporting actor by far has to be John Leguizamo, a Baz Luhrmann regular. He plays the dwarfed version of Toulouse-Lautrec well and represents all that glitters in the Bohemian. He believes in truth, beauty, and love and wants everyone around him to have all 3 if possible.The music is breathtaking. I always cry during the Come What May at the end of the show. And the look of the film is just beautiful. It makes the Moulin Rouge look like a beautiful carnival of sound, color, and melody.The pacing is just right. I understand that Luhrmann has a background in opera. This truly shows in his ability to make powerful use of the music mixed with the pictures. He has knowledge of how to play his audience. I was also impressed with how he created just the right mix of tragedy and comedy. During Act II, a very dark act, he throws in a light number, Like a Virgin, which provides needed comic relief. There is also the stunning dance number Roxanne, which makes effective use of the montage technique using scenes from both the dancers and the turmoil happening upstairs in an erotic tango. He truly builds tension to the breaking point.I highly recommend this movie for a romantic evening, a girls' night, or as a pick me up.

But sometimes, rarely indeed, a horror masterpiece will reach us by the hand of a Kubrick, with the adept, elusive touch of a great artist to guide the vision, and we know what separates it from all else.Okay, the story has enough promise that even a hired gun would have to try to fail. Heck, even Stephen King himself didn't fare so bad. It's how Kubrick perceives King's universe however, how he fills the frame with it, that renders THE SHINING a feast for the senses.Horror that will reach us through the mind and body alike, an assault as it were, tending eventually its pitch to a crescendo, yet curiously not without a delicate lull.Kubrick's cinema is, as usually, a sight to behold. We get the adventurous camera that prowls through the lavish corridors of the Overlook Hotel like it is some kind of mystic labyrinth rife for exploration, linear tracking shots exposing impeccably decorated interiors in symmetric grandeur. The geometrical approach in how Kubrick perceives space reminds me very much of Japanese directors of some 10 years before. In that what is depicted in the frame, the elements of narrative, is borderline inconsequential to how they all balance and harmonize together.Certain images stand out in this. The first shot of Jack's typewriter, ominously accompanied by the off-screen thumps of a ball, drums of doom that seem to emanate from the very walls or the typewriter itself, an instrument of doom in itself as is later shown. A red river flowing through the hotel's elevators in a poetry of slow motions. Jack hitting the door with the axe, the camera moving along with him, tracking the action as it happens, as though it's the camera piercing through the door and not the axe. The ultra fast zoom in the kid's face violently thrusting us inside his head before we see the two dead girls from his POV. And of course, the epochal bathroom scene.Much has been said of Jack Nicholson's obtrusive overacting. His mad is not entirely successful, because, well, he's Jack Nicholson. The guy looks half-mad anyway. Playing mad turns him into an exaggerated caricature of himself. Shelley Duvall on the other hand is one of the most inspired casting choices Kubrick ever made. Coming from a streak of fantastic performances for Robert Altman in the seventies (3 WOMEN, THIEVES LIKE US, NASHVILLE), she brings to her character the right amounts of swanlike fragility and emotional distress. A delicate, detached thing thrown in with the mad.

I was a total child of the '90s (indeed, sometimes I still say NOT! at the end of a sentence&#133; not (pun intended, sorry)), and one of the fondest memories I have from that period in my life was when my dad took my brother and sister and I to see The Lion King on the big screen in 1994, when I was only six years old. Although my memories of that experience are obviously now only very feint (about the only parts of the film I can recall from that screening are the Hakuna Matata scene and the stampede), The Lion King is a movie that has practically become part of my life.Influenced heavily by Shakespeare's Hamlet, The Lion King follows the adventures of Simba (voiced by Jonathan Taylor Thomas as a lion cub and Matthew Broderick as an adult lion), a curious and mischievous lion cub who just can't wait to be king. Framed for the murder of his father Mufasa (the commanding voice of James Earl Jones) and exiled from the Pride Lands by his jealous and power-mad uncle Scar (Jeremy Irons, voicing the kids' movie villain that has plagued the nightmares of more children than any other since the Wicked Witch of the West), Simba escapes to a rainforest paradise inhabited by Timon the meerkat (Nathan Lane, pricelessly hilarious) and Pumbaa the warthog (Ernie Sabella). However, destiny calls thanks in part to a reunion with childhood best friend Nala (voiced by Niketa Calame as a cub and Moira Kelly as a lioness), and Simba gallantly returns to the Pride Lands to at last confront his sins and take his rightful place as King of the Pride Lands.The Lion King is, without serious rivals, my absolute favourite animated film of all. And the reasons why? Firstly, the afore-mentioned nostalgic significance. But it goes much deeper than that. When I was a boy, I was completely oblivious to all the actual themes in the film, such as courage, loyalty, redemption and facing one's sins (although over the years it did teach me to learn from my mistakes). Now, as a far more experienced and worldly 20-year-old, I can watch The Lion King back and &#150; with now recognizing and understanding those themes, and seeing how ambiguously and intricately they're woven into the plot, so they're not shoved down the viewer's throat &#150; I now know and appreciate what a rare film The Lion King really is.On top of that, the traditional animation holds up very well against the now-dominant form that is computer animation, the screenplay by Irene Mecchi, Jonathan Roberts and Linda Woolverton is resplendent with by turns exuberance, humour, emotion and timeless and universal themes of the heart, and the soundtrack &#150; powered by those amazing Elton John\/Tim Rice standards Can You Feel the Love Tonight and Circle of Life and Hans Zimmer's mouth-watering score &#150; is second to none. Don't get me wrong, most other works in the Disney cannon are great, but this one will forever the jewel in the crown in my eyes. And I still have the VHS tape. And cry when Mufasa dies.
