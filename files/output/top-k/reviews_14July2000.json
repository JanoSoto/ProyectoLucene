They didn't even keep the costumes which to me was a somewhat big part of the X-Men, it was what separated each of them(aside from the powers, duh!). In the movie, apparently, they wore all black, taking away that uniqueness each had aside from their powers. They didn't have Angel or Beast even, characters there since the beginning. They had Rogue, but not Gambit(For me, you should have had both, not just one)! Moreover about Rogue, she didn't have that white hair you see in the comics(and even the cartoon) and she wore a cloak, not a leather jacket which she wore in the comics and cartoons!!! Mystique was naked the whole time(not that bad a thing) whereas she should have a costume, Sabretooth looked nothing like himself and who the hell was Toad?!So upon arriving at the theater, I was expecting not much at all. However, I sure was wrong about the movie. The movie still captured many aspects of the comic even though it missed out on others. The conflict between Wolverine and Cyclops was great, Charles was as hopeful as ever with Magneto forever opposing him and Wolverine still had the thing for Jean! Even more, Rogue does happen to get her unique blotch of white hair in the end(If you want to know how, watch the movie, there will be no spoilers here)! The action was pretty cool, I was seeing some of my favorite super heroes come to life. Watching Wolverine break out those awesome adamantium claws of his was so damn cool! As was seeing Storm hit Sabretooth with a bolt of lightning and Cyclops hitting them with his optic blasts! The Toad wasn't bad either, but Sabretooth still needed some work. The plot was something really pulled out a comic book which I wanted & liked and the actors played their roles well enough for me. Even if you're not a fan, give X-Men a try, bub!

I found every minute of this movie to be painfully terrifying to get through. As a huge fan of the movie, I can appreciate watching some of the more tame scenes of the movie and seeing the impending dangers closing in like charging bull. I one time heard someone say their favorite part of a horror film is before the horror starts, and watching as the characters are drawn into the terror of the film later on. Though few see the tame scenes as filler, and just a wait for the carnage to begin, this movie executes those scenes amazingly well. The first time I saw this movie, I afraid in the first scene when the van stopped by the side of the road, so horrified of what could happen, that what did happen--though almost considered kind of funny by many--seemed terrifying.One of the most shocking scenes is the first murder, because to someone watching, it is so quick and horrifying that you have to sit back and try to register what just happened to this character, and what just happened to you. Then the second murder--the infamous hook scene--gives a somewhat clearer picture of the horrors to endure, only heightened by the preceding scenes in the living room.The movie truly explodes at the fourth murder\/beginning of the long, relentless chase scene through the underbrush and backwoods. The scene when Sally Hardesty (played to honest perfection by should-have-been-a-big-star scream queen Marilyn Burns) gets to the house and runs up into the attic...well, I'll leave that scene to you. The dinner scene is disturbing to no end, with Sally screaming and begging for her life. You truly wonder if or how she will survive this nightmare, let alone escape. It's a struggle to sit through the sledgehammer scene without wincing at each attempt. Then the ending. The ending that may just be the most breathtaking ending to a horror movie. I guess you could consider it positive. But it's so wild and so insane that you don't even get a chance to feel relief. I always wondered what happened to the trucker who  stopped to help. It was the only true fault in the movie, that his character was abandoned, but I suppose in a way you can add that to the list of questions as to what would be the next course of events in the movie after the ending. (To list the other questions would be a terrible spoiler.) There is so much to say on this. The way the many old cars around the barn Kirk and Pam see implies the true massacre of the film, and not just the small handful of deaths in this movie. The way humans are portrayed as animals, and the family of cannibals are portrayed as us, the humans, with intentions only to kill and eat, it would seem. It's like a George Romero, how so much of this film has a message about something else. Also to mention again is the performace by Marilyn Burns. I was literally blown away by her performance as the horrified final girl who must endure a night of true hell. I only wish we got to see more of her, she is definitely an underrated scream queen.This is a true piece of cinema masterpiece. And as I said, it's unrelenting. Absolutely unrelenting.

So, I think that proves I'm not a commie, with the attention span of a fruit fly.  I liked Braveheart.  A lot.While the cinematography was adequate, and even interesting in some shots, the editor of this movie pretty much raped anything that the director of photography might have set out to do.  Cuts are made sometimes without even a 10-degree change in the camera's position.  Its no suprise the editor, David Brenner, also worked on ID4.  Its similar to the Armageddon school of Needless cuts.Apart from some laughable CG, the fake troops and scenery is generally good. I doubt I would have been able to spot them if I had not seen a small story on the process behind making the battlefield shots on DatelineNBC.Roland Emmerich (previous sins  ID4, Godzilla), the director, seemed to fancy the look Saving Private Ryan and Gladiator used (with better effect on SPR's part) with diagonal shutters, and altered shutter-speed.  Thankfully the action stays zoomed-out for the most part, unlike Gladiator where it was mostly close-up blur.This seems to be a good sign, but there is very little action. One of the opening night battles is a good sign to come, with gunpowder explosions lighting up the nearby forests beautifully.  But this action is not sustained.  That would be fine if the director could make us feel anything for the characters, but they are all walking cliches.  Emmerich relies heavily on a horrible, forgettable score.  I was shocked to see this was written by John Williams.  A stinker in every respect.  If this maudlin crap is your excuse for good orchestral music, I feel sorry for you.

The script did a great job of packing quite a bit of information into a short amount of time.  By doing so, they did skip some more in-depth characterization, but that's understandable.  There's still plenty there to get a sense of where the characters stand.  The story had some very entertaining and impressive action sequences, as well as some occasional sarcastic humor which fit the characters nicely.  I went to the movie with my wife and four others who had never touched any X-man comic (or other comic, most likely), and knew nothing about the heroes that they did not learn in the movie.  They all enjoyed it.  My wife wants to see it again, which surprises me.  Even the person in the group who is non action movie oriented gave it a thumbs up (not a super-excited-wow thumbs up, but a thumbs up none-the-less).  Having read the comics as a child, which I like to think wasn't too long ago, I caught a few inside jokes which were nice to see.  There are some changes to some characters (for instance, the original comic had an Iceman character as a charter member...here he's a younger more minor character), but they do not seem like they would be detrimental to the story for long-time fans.  I would venture a guess that there will be sequels, and that the budget will be much larger next time, and the running time will probably be extended.  I'm sure that there will be more development of relationships throughout the series.  This was a very good start with what they had to work with.  If you talk to someone who has read the comic after you see the movie, they will probably fill you in on a couple things about the characters and their pasts that would be interesting in reflection and setup the next couple of films.  Like I said, I was the only person who had any background knowledge of the X-men, and our whole party enjoyed it thoroughly.  Job well done.Have fun!

One thing  that I didn't like was wolverine's claws they look like plastic.  The claws don't look any dangerous they just look like some toys. The movie could have been better and so could the action that's the weakest points of the movie. For a movie like this you need a good story and very good action sequences to support it. This movie has a good story but the action sequences aren't that good nor are the special effects. This could have been a good or maybe a great action movie but it wasn't ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"14 July 2000","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  I saw this movie years ago, first day at the theater, and I still enjoy it a lot!

It did it's job very well. The purpose of the movie was to scare the viewers and it really worked fine.This was the first movie of it's type, and after this film there have been many other movies made trying to duplicate it.The sequel of Scream (Scream 2) was not as succesful as the first one. And the last one (Scream 3) was a total chaos.The reason why Scream was so fantastic is, as I mentioned before, it was the first movie of it's type. No other movies like this had been made before, so nothing in the movie could be said that it was ripped off from other movie(s).The plot isn't that good, we all know that, and neither are the performances by the actors, but the reason I'm saying that this film is so good is because it accomplished it's mission, it gave a really good time to all the people who watched it (at least all the young people), so I guess I can't complain. I really enjoyed watching the movie.I'll rate it with a 9 out of 10. It's not really a 9 movie, it's more of like a 7 movie, but as I said, most (young) people enjoyed it a lot, it was original and the first of it's kind.
