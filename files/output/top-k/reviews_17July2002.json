My 30-something girlfriend and I saw 'Shrek' on our own and enjoyed it thoroughly, as I did again when watching it with my two kids.  I loved 'Monsters Inc.' to bits as well.'Snow Dogs' is, however, best enjoyed vicariously through the delight of young peeps, as the humour is based on pretty routine slap-stick and cute, furry animals.  And on that level, I have to go with the ratings of my two very young critics and give it two thumbs up.There was just one bit that bemused me (cue the *SPOILER*) I knew just one thing about this film prior to entering the cinema and that was it had dogs that talked, a la 'Cats and Dogs'.  The trailers seemed to trade on this aspect.  However, the talking dogs routine accounts for 30 seconds (if that) of the entire film, which was disappointing for those banking on it.On the whole, I'd recommend it as a good, enjoyable family film and echo the sentiments about the lack of racy, sailor-blushing language if that's important in your selection.

Well, whatever they thought, I loved this movie, and so far have seen it twice.Just like Shrek and the Toy Story movies, this film is targeted at different age groups and types of audiences. There's all the stuff for the under tens (my mental age) and there's vintage Scooby scenes for the original fans (I was in my mid-teens when Scooby first appeared on UK screens and I love cartoons). Then there's material clearly aimed at movie fans, like there's a line from Shaggy (Matthew Lillard) which spoofs the actor's lines from Scream. But if anyone is expecting a hard-hitting political or social drama, they are going to be really disappointed.That said though, within it's own world, it all works very well. It has comedy (subtle and silly), it has slapstick and it has drama. There are also some genuine moments of pathos which are supplied by Matthew Lillard as Shaggy and a CGI Scooby. With the exception of Lillard's brilliant and Oscar worthy performance as Shaggy, most of the cast are out-acted by the computer generated dog. Linda Cardellini is superb as clever but nerdy Velma and for a couple of scenes has a sexy-make-over look. So what we have is an entertaining roller-coaster of a movie (for the most part) with some neat plot twists that is suitable for everyone, except witless snobs.After I watched this the first time, I immediately thought Spider-Man was a pile of dog poo, ha ha.VERDICT Four and a half out of five. Very Good.
