Nothing justifies writing a hateful film yet that's exactly what Thelma & Louise writer Callie Khouri (by her own admission) does here - as you will see in the quote I'm about to show you (which I can't even quote completely because - while IMDb provides the complete quote elsewhere, it won't let its reviewers use the same vile language!!! Tells you something, doesn't it?). In fact, her response to those who are offended by this piece of trash (namely the quote I provide below) is so offensive in and of itself that it surpasses the offenses of this film. I would hope Hollywood pays attention to what Callie Khourie has to say and shuns her for her hate-filled mind. No bigotry should be tolerated - anywhere in our society - and Ms. Khourie admits to bigotry when she tries to justify the hatred she expresses in Thelma & Louise in this quote (FYI you can find this quote on the IMDb site itself - just click on Khourie's name where she's listed as writer and scroll down to her quotes)Kiss my a**, kiss my a**. I was raised in this society. Let them get their deal worked out about the way women are treated in films before they start hassling me about the way men are treated. There's a whole genre of films known as 'exploitation' based on the degradation of women and as a whole bunch of redneck critics extolling its virtues, and until there's a subgenre of women doing the same thing to men in numbers too numerous to court, as is the case with exploitation film, then just shut the f*** up.Very nice language, Ms. Khourie. You're a real class act. And, in quoting you directly, I think I've proved my point. Khouri - in case you missed it - is saying she's justified in putting out hateful trash, movies like Thelma & Louise that is, and present men as foul unredeemable pigs because she thinks that's how women are portrayed in other movies. Really! Well at least she pleads guilty to her sin, that of portraying half the world in a hateful light. We need not prove that she did so as a result. The question then remains do we want writers like this in Hollywood? (This is precisely why people are no longer flocking to the movie theatres. They don't want to be offended by trash like Thelma & Louise.) Shame on Hollywood for putting out this kind of trash by a writer who reveals herself to be a hater of men and someone without a stitch of humanity or class. Hate is hate is hate and it is no better because the hater is female than it is when the hater is male. And - by the way - what movies is Ms. Khourie referring to, the ones she's bashing? Let's find out - because I bet that you that in and of itself will reveal how very warped she really is. Meantime - Ms. Khourie we don't need your films, thank you. If you want to vent your bile do it elsewhere. All I can say is viewers like myself have a choice. And I choose never again to be victimized by Ms. Khouri's hatred - and I will exercise my rights to this by avoiding any movie she's associated with.

There are several reasons for this. Firstly, it is a genuinely eerie film with several spine tingling moments. Secondly, it looks gorgeous but more of that later. And thirdly, it's quite experimental and even transgressive at times giving it a more modern feel than you might expect.It's about a governess called Miss Giddens who accepts a job to look after a couple of young orphan children who live in a large house in a remote estate. Before long she starts to see two ghostly apparitions who appear to be dead former employees, the former governess and her lover. These spirits seem to have possessed the two children leading to some extremely disquieting behaviour.It's based on the Henry James story 'Turn of the Screw', a book I have never read but which I have seen at least one other film adaption for. I think it's only fair to say that The Innocents is the greatest of these adaptions though by some margin. Not only that but it's one of the best haunted house movies ever made. From the outset you are made aware that this isn't going to be an ordinary affair. It has a very weird beginning. A girl sings a strange song over a black screen for a disquieting amount of time before the Fox logo appears. The first images we then see are a close-up of praying hands with bird song in the background, while a woman seemingly in some sort of distress prays. It's a terrifically strange opening, beautifully shot, with great sound design. It's an early indicator of the work of one of the chief architects of the film, namely cinematographer Freddie Francis. Throughout the picture there is an amazingly effective use of the widescreen frame. The camera-work is far from static though. It often fluidly swirls around characters and there is a prominent use of deep focus lensing where we see characters in the background and foreground in focus simultaneously. What's impressive is that while extremely impressive, the camera-work isn't showy; it always serves a purpose and accentuates the foreboding nature of the narrative and accentuates the dramatics. It's also only fair to say that it's hard to imagine this particular film being improved by colour, the black and white photography is simply perfect.Helping matters a lot is the great sets. The house, pond, tower and gazebo are all utilised to their maximum effect. Like the best haunted house movies, the setting is as much a character as the people. Deborah Kerr is outstanding as the governess. She brings a huge amount of skill to the role and makes the character so multi-layered that a great deal of ambiguity comes into play. Are there ghosts or is everything in the governess's mind? There is a cameo appearance by Michael Redgrave as the absent uncle but it's the child actors Martin Stephens and Pamela Franklin who really make an impression alongside Kerr. If these creepy kids hadn't been played by such brilliant child actors the film would have had far less impact. Young Martin Stephens in particular is extremely good. The moment when he kisses Miss Giddens remains extremely potent and incredible over forty years later; a striking moment of horror in such a subtle way. In general, that is one of the things that make this a classic. The way it consistently maintains an atmosphere of dread without ever resorting to anything visceral is highly impressive. There are several unforgettable moments of this kind of spine-tingling horror, possibly the best being the image of the governess standing and staring from the reeds from across the old pond. It's an image that stays in the mind. And it's a film on the whole that you will want to return to.

Shows like The Flinstones, Leave It To Beaver and The Brady Bunch all had their share of remakes. From what I've seen they were...awful. Granted, not as bad as the current remakes but they were still awful. Somehow The Addams Family Values is the only exception.First off, the Addams Family show was based on single frame comics from the 1930's. The show was what the Addams Family name is most known for because the 1930's comics don't have any story, plot or characters. The show, to its credit, is actually still entertaining by today's standards. It takes some of the social commentary of the time and makes fun of it. Where The Brady Bunch was the perfect family, The Addams Family was the imperfect family and the joke is the Addams' are happy about it.The plot of this movie is actually my only complaint. Its about Uncle Fester who gets a girlfriend who wants to kill him to inherit the family fortune. The problem with this is that the style of jokes aren't the same, don't get me wrong, this movie offers up some genuinely funny moments (unlike the Addams film with Tim Curry) but it just doesn't feel like a real episode of the show nor the same style of the show. Not only that but the climax is that Debby (Fester's bride) threatens to kill the Addams' but the Addams family embrace death. When Debby first meets Gomez, he jokes about killing ladies (I bet you're a lady-killer Acquitted).The subplot, however, is just pure comedy gold. Through a misunderstanding Gomez and Morticia send Wednesday and Pugsley to a summer camp where they want you to have fun...whether you like it or not. This was just a perfect rendition of the style of humor that the show is known for. This is only in the movie for...45% of the time. The joke is that the leader of the camp decides to stage a play, paying tribute to the first Thanksgiving. Its all butterflies and sweetness as opposed to...what really happened. I wont spoil the punchline for you but it's worth it.The acting is an area that I have to draw comparisons with the original show. I like Raul Julia as Gomez, Christopher Lloyd as Fester, Christina Ricci as Wednesday and Jimmy Workman as Pugsley but the rest of the cast either aren't on screen for enough time to develop (Grandma Addams) or just can't hold a candle (Morticia and Lurch...although, to be fair, the guy that plays Lurch doesn't have a single line). The new characters are all decently portrayed but the best ones are Mercedes McNab as Ellen Buckman, Peter MacNicol as Gary Granger and Christine Baranski as Becky Martin-Granger.So as a fan of the show, do I recommend this? Despite its problems, yes. It has many moments that are actually quite well done and despite the show having a bit more nostalgic value and...no dumb-ass gold digger plots, its still enjoyable. Some of the dumb stuff is enjoyable, its still funny, go check it out.

Unfortunately, the same care that goes into the style of the film does not go into the romance or the plot. It can be fun to look at, but it is not fun when you are actually looking for something beyond the look of the film.The scenes are rich and festive, filled with a lot of eye candy and glamorous colors to get your attention. A problem with this is that the film is shot so quickly that you do not have time to admire the visuals and are instead assaulted with quick shot after quick shot of them that does not allow you to take it all in.The movie is more interested in showing off its visuals than it is at giving the audience a story that the visuals can all fall back on. Christian (Ewan McGregor) is our run-of-the-line tragic poet who came to Paris against his father's wishes and believes strongly in things like love. After one brief meeting with the Moulin Rouge's star, a courtesan named Satine (Nicole Kidman), Christian is in love. While at first she is not in love with Christian, singing a few parts from present day songs a few scenes later makes her realize she is in love. Unfortunately for the two, Satine must sleep with the Duke (Richard Roxburgh) if she is to get out of the Moulin Rouge and become a real star. These events gives off one of the most clichéd love triangles of film history.By the end of the film, the plot of Moulin Rouge has gotten more out of hand than its visuals. The love triangle gets out of hand with nonsensical character motivations and the characters acting dumb. Christian and Satine plan to run off together because the Duke will not allow them to be together, but once she discovers she's dying they can't run off together for some reason. Before that happens, a background character with no reason to not want Christian and Satine together reveals their relationship to the Duke and torments Christian over the fact that Satine has to be with the Duke. By the end, the characters are out of this world, acting stupid, insane, or having sudden random motivations that make no sense.Moulin Rouge is an assault on your eyes and ears, bombarding you with non-stop visuals and loud noises with very few quiet breaks in between to let what you've just watched sink in.

Sadly &#x96; but predictably &#x96; this results in a pretentious, dreadfully overlong and ridiculous piece of melodramatic soap-opera schlock! Back in the era of pioneering cinema, there were a handful of titles &#x96; I walked with a Zombie and White Zombie to name just two &#x96; that put forward the theme of voodoo as something uniquely macabre and nightmarish, but ever since the 1980's, many directors mistakenly assume that it is horrifying enough just to insert images of bloody headless chicken corpses and African tribes performing silly dance rituals. Schlesinger makes the exact same mistake and, atop of that, also adds far too many family drama sub plots and redundant detective elements. The opening sequences are supposed to be tragic and heart-wrenching but (and maybe it's just me?) I found them quite imbecilic and banal. Police psychiatrist Cal Jamison loses his wife in a far-fetched kitchen accident &#x96; malfunctioning coffee machines and spilled milk do not go well together &#x96; and moves to the center of New York with his 7-year-old son. What follows is an irritating series of clichéd situations, since daddy falls in love with the new landlady but obviously doesn't want to neglect his traumatized little boy. Meanwhile, his job also drags him into a spider web of intrigues regarding the Santerío-religion. This strange religion worships African spirits in the shape of Christian Gods (or something like it, I don't know) and has quite a few of influential disciples in NY. The lives of innocent young boys are sacrificed in favor of obnoxious rich adults and, because he sticks his nose too much in the voodoo business, Jamison's own son is suddenly in danger as well. Unlike Alan Parker in the superior Angel Heart, John Schlesinger didn't have the balls to show any controversial themes or shocking images. However, if you happen to fancy tedious and confusing dialogs, dull sentimental interludes, a complete lack of atmosphere or tension and weak performances from usually reliable actors (besides Sheen also Robert Loggia, Harris Yulin and Jimmy Smits), then you absolutely must see The Believers. I'm required to admit there are two memorable highlights as well, though. There's one marvelous, but misfit, scene with eerie little spiders crawling out of a woman's jaw and also the casting of Malick Bowens as the sinister voodoo priest. His evil stare was the only thing preventing me to stop watching this garbage before it was actually finished.
