Its not exactly brilliant and its entirely by the book and simple but has a little charm and is easy to watch. The film does have a great comedic cast and everyone seems to work really well together. I was a little surprised at how low this film scores and also some of the harsh reviews. At the very least its very entertaining. The pacing of the film is great, there is lots of emotional moments and I like it because there is a great balance of ying and yang to it meaning girls will love the heart and romance and guys will enjoy the male presence in the film too. Its just zany fun. Now I admit I'm a bit of a sucker for really good physical comedy and this film has it in spades. I'm not sure there has been a comedy since that uses that kind of comedy antics to make you laugh and it does it so well in my opinion. Now despite the fact that the first 3\/4 of the film is simple and straight forward the last climatic scene of this movie is pure comedy gold. It is a riot watching this couple give birth to their son. Its antics unlike anything else out there and easily one of my favourite scenes in a film.Hugh Grant had a great career for a long time. He was King of the romantic comedies and the likable everyman. He is quite good in this playing a little bit stuck up but a guy who really tries. He's just very likable and you want to be his buddy and you understand him and he leads the cast well. His character doesn't exactly get a lot of depth but he pulls it off. Julianne Moore is decent as his loving girlfriend who gets pregnant. I wouldn't say she really stands out in the film, this is really more about Grant but she plays her part well and they have good chemistry. Tom Arnold and Joan Cusack are the stereotypical best friend roles although Arnold and Grant have this fun rivalry that really is a great part of the movie. Arnold was very good at being the obnoxious buddy type role and he and Cusack are really great together. The four of them are literally the reason to watch this film. Jeff Goldblum has an unfortunately small role as Grant's buddy who is a womanizer but has life lessons to teach. Goldblum is great but the role is too small. And then...the incomparable, much missed, comedy genius...Mr. Robin Williams. God I loved this man. No one did comedy like he did. This is Williams at his best. He's a neurotic, scared, Russian doctor who has never actually delivered a baby. His one liners are spot on and his physical comedy is unbelievable. He is drop dead hilarious in this film.Honestly, Chris Columbus is a genius in so many ways. He does these mainstream, almost typical cookie-cutter drama\/comedies but they're also just incredibly entertaining. His films are easy to watch with great characters and he always has a great cast behind him. I wouldn't say Nine Months is one of his best but it certainly showcases the kind of film he is great at. This is just one of those films that you have to go in with the right expectations and just sit back and enjoy it. I say this a lot but people take movies like this too seriously. Sometimes (in fact most times) movies should be simple and fun and just entertain you and Nine Months absolutely does that. My beautiful wife and I watched this tonight and she is just about eight months pregnant so we got to laugh at the idea of what giving birth might mean for us. Its just fun people!!

Based on a pulp comic character from the 30's this film franchise turned the idea on its head and into a cult spanning many different formats and influencing other fantasy films, it also helped some videogames along the way.The plot is simple, Conan is taken from his family who have been conveniently killed by a band of nasty warriors dressed in black. He is put into slavery and made to do hard labour for the rest of his foreseeable future. The torturous slavery makes Conan big and strong despite the apparent lack of decent food, nutrients, fishfingers or milk. He eventually is sold into gladiatorial fighting where he becomes a brilliant battler and swordsman and wins his freedom. From there on he's off to avenge his families death, as you do.Obvious premise but its an old film folks. Yes the film is old, back in 82 things were different, what you see now when watching is a horribly clichéd, predictable, hammy, semi cheap looking mess, but back then it was fresh...ish. All the bad guys wear black and look a bit camp with their wigs and handlebar moustaches, you wonder why exactly these groups of bad guys always attack and kill helpless useless peasants, what's in it for them? why they always leave one kid alive to grow up and take revenge on them?? and what is James Earl Jones character actually up to? what's his goal? his plans? why do all those people follow him? etc...Yeah I know I'm being picky, it matters not really, the film is old and all these barbarian films are pretty much the same, its all about the spectacle and fantasy right. This first film is definitely more adult than the rest, lots of blood splashing about with limbs being hacked off...good stuff. Yet despite that there isn't too much action really, more character development surprisingly and what action there is has some nice effects too, nice snake work and some nice animated spirits also.To be honest I've actually always preferred the original 'Beastmaster' film over Conan. There a few nice moments in this but really its pretty tepid, if only 'The Beastmaster' starred Arnie. And what the hell was that huge wheel thing Conan pushes for half his life suppose to be? a mill? a well? or merely for torture? a plan that backfired for Thulsa Doom methinks.In the end the final teasing image and narration about King Conan is actually far more interesting and intriguing than the film that preceded it.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"12 February 2015","score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" The first film to get Arnie on the way to the man he is today, and the first of three very similar fantasy flicks.

The only difference here is its not an adult horror comedy but much lighter. But contrary to what you might think this film is actually better than the first in my opinion.The old mansion appears to be an ancient Mayan temple with gateways to other dimensions that is somehow protected or kept in line by a crystal skull. Said skull is supposedly buried with one of the boys great great grandfather sooooo off they go to dig him up. Long story short Gramps the zombie befriends them and helps them defend the skull from the forces of evil, oh and they gotta save the girlfriend who gets kidnapped of course.It all sounds like a kids cartoon but trust me its really quite good fun. The boys end up going into some prehistoric world with dinosaurs to get the skull after its pinched, they battle Mayan tribesmen, save a Mayan Princess, adopt a baby pterodactyl and a weird caterpillar dog thing plus there's the evil cowboy zombie gunslinger also after the skull.It all sounds surreal but like other 80's fluff it looks great with some nice hokey effects that make you smile. There is also some pretty good makeup and prosthetics again with Gramps the zombie and Slim Razor the zombie plus some great kooky sets that look like something out of the 'Addams Family' TV show. I also really liked the cast in this too. Johnathan Stark is great as the lippy wise ass best friend of Arye Gross. Both guys really click together and make a formidable 80's duo just like Makepeace and Rusler in 'Vamp'. Stark actually reminds me of an early Jim Carrey with his haircut and looks, Arye is a regular face for this era as was Bill Maher.

By now, Harry's cynical interactions with journalists have become rather dull and routine, and what's also repetitive is the fact that villains fire off entire arsenals of machine gun bullets at him while he just nonchalantly shoots once with his Magnum and kills the opponent immediately. The concept of The Dead Pool is still engaging enough, but the film contains far too many dumb sequences, clichéd & predictable sub plots and dire politically correct supportive characters! The glorious days of punk! and Go ahead, make my day&#x85; are gone forever. Around the same time that a jailed mafia boss put a price on his head, Dirty Harry is investigating the strange death of a punk-rock star\/actor. He &#x96; Johnny Squares &#x96; was just shooting a film with the notoriously sleazy and sicko horror director Peter Swan, and Harry &#x96; together with his new Asian American partner Quan &#x96; discovers that Swan organizes a macabre little game called dead pool where he predicts the death of celebrities. The people on this list also actually start dying, and Dirty Harry is on there too! Is Peter Swan really as psychopathic as his reputation suggests? Are the murders controlled from behind bars? Does Lt. Callahan even care? The idea of a celebrity dead pool is quite exciting and some of the supportive characters are fascinating. Jim Carrey briefly appears as the first murder victim Johnny Squares and uses his facial talents to do a funny playback imitation of Guns 'n Roses' classic song Welcome to the Jungle. The sequence perhaps doesn't fit in a supposedly raw and gritty late '80s thriller, but it's definitely fun. Also Liam Neeson is delightfully loathsome as the scumbag director &#x96; complete with ponytail &#x96; and, as a horror fanatic, I would really love to watch some of the fictional films that he made. They have titles such as Hell without the Devil, Hotel Satan and Night of the Slasher! Where can I buy those? The questionable highlight of The Dead Pool is undeniably the long and totally bonkers chase of Callahan & Quan versus a six inch remote controlled toy car with a bomb hidden in it. I honestly can't figure out whether this sequence is meant to be a parody or a genuine moment of suspense. The two actors try very hard to look scared and the stunt work is impressive for sure, but the scene is so damn goofy and implausible that even the good old principle of 'suspension of disbelief' fails! By starring in this otherwise pointless and nonsensical film, I strongly believe that Clint Eastwood was merely just doing a favor to his Buddy-director ","genre":null},{"date":"12 February 2015","score":"","review":" 17 years and four degenerating sequels later, I presume it's about time for Dirty Harry to think about retirement&#x85; Throughout the franchise, the legendary character Inspector Harry Callahan has transformed from an unorthodox and nihilistic copper into a bleak and almost laughable caricature, and since the release of the the almighty 1971 original, the big cinema screen got overflowed with similar protagonists, usually depicted by equally grumpy-looking actors (Charles Bronson, Chuck Norris&#x85;).

By now, Harry's cynical interactions with journalists have become rather dull and routine, and what's also repetitive is the fact that villains fire off entire arsenals of machine gun bullets at him while he just nonchalantly shoots once with his Magnum and kills the opponent immediately. The concept of The Dead Pool is still engaging enough, but the film contains far too many dumb sequences, clichéd & predictable sub plots and dire politically correct supportive characters!

So yes this film is the original hokey zombie popcorn flick that inspired an entire modern pop culture.The main course of this silly film is the terrific makeup and puppetry on display throughout the film. The zombies are on top form as they stagger around with limbs and faces flopping off left right and centre. All are really played well by a large cast of extras who really put a lot of effect into their performances. If you think of 'Thriller' (1983) then you have a good sense of this film basically. Its an extended adult version of 'Thriller' but not quite as good in the makeup and effects department believe it or not. But its clear where the idea came from as a lot of the undead awakening sequences and overall visuals look very similar, a bit of a rip off really.Still this has some great chuckle moments mainly from Karen and Mathews with their little double acts, whilst Calfa actually brings a sense of realism and believable acting to the fold with his performance.

Michael Mann's direction and the film editing are excellent, especially in the first hour. Not filled with action, these skills still create a suspenseful and engaging story. Russell Crowe assumes the role of the whistleblower against the tobacco industry beautifully. The depiction of Mike Wallace by Christopher Plummer could not be better, and his part is written beautifully to bring out Wallace's ambiguous loyalties, being in between the corporate structure and the more aggressive producer played by Al Pacino. Pacino's part is quite good, but a little less convincing. Most of the time he has few doubts about his work and how he goes about it, viewing himself as something of a white knight. Later in the film, he develops more doubts. The film does raise questions about what's it all about, and conflicting loyalties, and what devotion to truth actually buys. It actually doesn't beat up on the tobacco industry or smoking that much or that directly, choosing instead to focus on the man's life who is the insider and how his battle cost him dearly. The film is strong drama. The script handles quite well the interactions of its three principals Crowe, Pacino and Plummer. It takes its time, and this contributes to the 157-minute running time. Maybe it takes too much time. There is some needless repetition of the Plummer-Crowe interview. Also, the downside of smoking is lung cancer, not simply that it is a drug or addictive as the movie emphasized. Deeper issues of how to handle the personal ingestion of any substance that is linked to mortality and many other problems, such as alcohol, are not explored in this movie. In some ways, it's more an indictment of the American legal system and its susceptibility to the influence of large pools of wealth that hire a corps of lawyers to produce results.The overall impression is of a movie that's trying hard to be good. It has to work at creating a product that somehow came easier when Hollywood was at its peak in the 20th century. The story would have stood a good chance of being cut down in those days but have gained effectiveness in the process. Nowadays, things are dragged out more. The result is a good movie but one that feels overdone and too long for what it ends up saying and communicating. I thought Plummer and Crowe were terrific.

I don't like fantasy and sorcery themes, so I didn't read the novels either, but I appreciate a good spoof and satire of anything. So, despite not being entirely familiar with the concept, I could immediately recognize satirical elements, because of the dialogue and the way situations and scenes were written - in a specifically dark and humorous English manner. What I also noted is how distant and restrained and overly superficial the direction is, which brings me back to the choice of director.Was experience with child actors really, really the most important requirement for a director's seat here? Sure Columbus had plenty. He was also hugely successful with Home Alone flicks. However, while his superficial, distant, flamboyant style was effective and quite suitable in a Christmas flick - here it brought nothing but disinterest in this viewer. Harry Potter is not physical comedy, nor is it meant to be a cookie-cutter, family oriented cinema. Columbus made it exactly that. Perhaps he has no clue or interest to do things otherwise, perhaps producers didn't want him to. And perhaps all he had to do is to bring the camera a little closer and more personal, and maybe edit it with more pace.That's what Gilliam knows how to do. He may be an American, like Columbus, but he knows all about the quirks of British humour. He is also long-proved expert in satirical approach to themes, just take a look at his Monty Python opus, or the 12 Monkeys blockbuster. I can't help but think what could have become of this series if he, or somebody like him, took charge. No doubt a good and memorable film, perhaps even a masterpiece and certainly not a forgettable Goonies in England borefest. The absence of satirical angle ruins the whole effort and turns it into a clichéd quick-cash-in, while the original intent was to toy with clichés and make fun of them. But I guess Columbus' experience with child actors is what counts, right?Mind you, that experience doesn't show here at all. The young cast is borderline annoying, naturally inexperienced and obviously poorly guided. The film was saved by veteran adult supporting cast, especially Alan Rickman and Kenneth Brannagh.

Anyway, failing to cast Gilliam as the director of Harry Potter is for me somewhere up there in the top ten of colossal Hollywood blunders, along with failing to cast Kevin Kline as Peter Pan in Hook, Tom Selleck as Indiana Jones in Raiders of the Lost Ark, or Sissy Spacek as Princess Leia in Star Wars.

This film does not live up to the style of the books or the TV incarnation, and that may be part of the reason for its low rating. As a stand-alone action spy thriller, it's quite entertaining, with the obligatory plot holes pulling it down from a really high score, but fun to watch nonetheless.Val Kilmer plays The Saint, who witnessed the death of another youngster at a cruel religious orphanage when he escaped. Two decades later, The Saint is an internationally active go-to man for difficult jobs, like stealing a microchip from a Russian industrial magnate. That he does, and soon the plot evolves into a chase for a cold fusion formula. The formula was only half worked out by smart and beautiful physicist Emma (Elizabeth Shue) when Kilmer steals it. The film then takes some improbable turns to get the main characters near the clutches of the evil industrial magnate, who wants to use the non-functional formula to discredit Russia's elected president during an energy crisis. At the last minute, with the aid of a Russian scientist, the good guys get the formula to work, and in the epilogue The Saint manages yet again to evade British police.The Saint evades everyone with elaborate disguises, which make the movie fun to watch. Kilmer demonstrated that he can really act, although he's not quite a Peter Sellers when it comes to playing a bundle of different characters. The chemistry (or should I say, physics) between Shue and Kilmer is great, so the romantic entanglements in this action thriller also hold up.The movie well reflects the hopes for détente and democratization in Russia held in the West in the 90s, and now soundly dashed by the interminable Putkin regime. The energy crisis theme rings truer and truer with passing years.Occasionally the film moves slowly, and there are unnecessary plot holes that could have been fixed quite easily with better scripting, but none of these minor problems detract from the jolly good 100 minutes of fun that The Saint brings to the screen. I've seen it a couple of times, and like good James Bond flicks (Thunderball et al.), it can be enjoyed more than once.

The makeup and effects are again excellent and show what can be done with real hands on skills instead of just using CGI. This follow up is not as bloody and in your face as the first but more of a slapstick horror with icky green\/brown pus favoured over ye olde claret. The odd thing in this sequel is they clearly follow the same plot route as the first. The plot is your standard zombie outbreak type of thing with toxic waste causing the usual problems, but it all feels like a reboot because the first film used toxic gas as the problem that causes the dead to rise from their graves. From there on its virtually the same spiel, literately!The use of the same actors in the exact same type of roles, albeit with different names, is strange yet it doesn't seem to matter. The same type of humour and even the same dialog at times make this film feel like a rerun of the first film but with better effects and a lighter tone. Despite the positively evil looking poster art the film isn't very scary at all, its almost a spoof at times, but a very good one.An amusing 'Thriller' mockery moment at the end typifies how silly this franchise has become, but it is quite amusing I must admit. At the end of the day it still a very good horror comedy and doesn't take itself seriously at all which helps. I think the route they decide to take with this franchise after the first film was the right choice otherwise it would have just been seen as a Romero franchise ripoff.The actors are having fun in their roles and the special effects guys are having a blast with all the slimy gruesome gore.

How about pull off the ultimate robbery&#x85;and just for the ever-loving hell of it? That's just what Steve McQueen manages to do as the title character in director Norman Jewison's 1968 crime film THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR. McQueen was one of those actors that is depressingly rare in today's high-glamor, hardcore violent Hollywood an actor where you only have to look at him to know exactly what he is thinking. He's a rich, successful bank executive who's got so much money and leads such a playboy lifestyle; and yet, he is so bored that, perhaps just for entertainment purposes, he concocts a scheme to rob a bank in Boston, initiated by four associates of his. It seems like the perfect crime. But he hasn't counted on a gorgeous insurance investigator, played by Faye Dunaway, finding her way into his life in an attempt to nail him for this huge heist. And at the same time, Dunaway hasn't counted on her quarry's warped nature either.This is just simply one of those films that takes you back on a time trip of sorts to a time when, after the old Hollywood studio system had collapsed and the way of making films got so radically changed, experimentation in editing, cinematography, and plot were the in things. With respect to THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR, that feeling is enhanced by the inventive direction of Norman Jewison, who had directed McQueen on 1965's THE CINCINNATI KID, and had also done IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT. Jewison, together with legendary cinematographer Haskell Wexler (who had worked with him on IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT), combines inventive editing styles and the use of split-screen, a technique later used by Brian DePalma in several of his films (including SISTERS and CARRIE), McQueen and Dunaway really do strike sparks in ways that not even Pierce Brosnan and Renee Russo could in the 1999 reworking of this movie. Jack Weston (one of the vicious heavies in 1967's WAIT UNTIL DARK), Yaphet Kotto (in an early role), Paul Burke, Gordon Pinsent, and Richard Bull also do good turns here, helped out by the original screenplay of Alan R. Trustman (who shortly thereafter co-wrote the screenplay for McQueen's mega-hit BULLITT).The film also features a lush orchestral score by French composer Michel LeGrand that also includes the Allan and Marilyn Bergman song The Windmills Of Your Mind (sung in the film by Noel Harrison, but better remembered in the version by Dusty Springfield that was a hit in the spring of 1969). Windmills itself won the 1968 Oscar for Best Song, and rightfully so.By our standards, the crime and sex may seem hopelessly tame, especially in comparison to, say, a Quentin Tarantino bloodbath; but with people like Jewison, McQueen, and Dunaway involved, THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR still ranks as one of the best of its genre type and its era.

The fact its Arnie in the main role as Conan saves the film from doom in my opinion as there isn't too much more on offer. There isn't much action of note, not much blood, set pieces are drab and the adventure a bit dull, the only thing to lift you is the nice monster sequence at the end (head looks a bit like the Brundlefly creature from the Cronenberg film). That and Sarah Douglas being all sexy n evil (oh my Queen!), for me these films haven't aged so well and I still prefer 'The Beastmaster'.4\/10 ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"},{"date":"12 February 2015","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Version I saw UK DVD releaseActors 6\/10Plot\/script 6\/10Photography\/visual style 6\/10Music\/score 6\/10Overall 6\/10It's easy to forget these days, but there was a time when Eddie Murphy was widely acknowledged as one of the funniest men alive.

This film is directed by Richard Fleischer who also directed 'Conan the Destroyer', the same studio, Dino De Laurentiis Company, made all three films, Sandahl Bergman was in this film and 'Conan the Barbarian' and of course Arnie starred in all three.I mean lets be honest here, Arnie plays Lord Kalidor, the character is virtually a Conan clone, I dunno why they didn't just make him Conan and be done with it. I believe Sonja comes from the Conan universe originally (I may be wrong) so why not? I'm guessing there may have been copyright issues somewhere.So its the same story again for this fantasy adventure, need I describe the plot? A small band of goodies up against an evil baddie leader and all her baddie warriors who are all holed up in an intimidating fortress. Arnie rides around in his rather unattractive red sparkly jumpsuit (changes to a black number out of the blue half way through) whilst Nielsen sports a long red mullet cut, but she's still cute.This is suppose to be the weakest of the Arnie broadsword adventures but personally I don't see it. Its no worse than the other two and gives you just as much visual sorcery. In fact there's more fantasy stuff going on here than 'CtB', giant pet spiders, giant skeleton bridges, a metallic sea monster thingy and a silly Flash Gordon style baddie wizard. This film boarders more on other films such as 'Krull' and a bit of 'Willow' in my opinion.Reasonable amounts of blood and limb chopping but not overkill. Everything looks a bit tacky later on in the film but again no worse than the other two films. Unfortunately there is an annoying kid in this film, kinda like Data from 'The Goonies' or Short Round from 'Temple of Doom' (same kid actor there), tends to give the film a more slapstick approach at times, 'Conan the Barbarian' was always the most grown up of the three.At this point I reckon Arnie was possibly getting worried he may end up typecast as a barbarian meathead in fantasy films. I can see why this was his last as all three of these films are very similar and not overly wonderful frankly. Still the musical score was always in good hands with Morricone at the helm, how did they manage that? As a kid I loved these films, nowadays the rose tinted shades can't quite save them, amusing and naff, oh and the baddie Queen is a lesbian. Oh yeah, the whole story is down to Sonja simply rejecting her advances at the start, fancy that.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"12 February 2015","score":"","review":" The third film in the Conan trilogy...well it pretty much was wasn't it.

It did have a great suspenseful chase when Wendy is being chased by the man with the axe. It really seemed like a low budgeted movie from the 80's that leeches on the fact that it has one of the most notable and famous scream queens. Surprisingly Leslie Nielsen is in it for about 10 or 15 minutes at the most as Jaime Lee Curtis's father and tell you what he'd always be the last person I'd assume was in a slasher film.
