He turns around to see that he has done what he came to do. Afraid at first, Hogarth runs, but quickly realizes that the iron giant means him no harm.Hogarth must teach his metal friend, voiced by Vin Diesel that guns are bad and that he doesn't have to be one, even though he is equipped with some major fire arms. Without a place to hide him and no food for him to eat, Hogarth takes the iron giant over to Dean's pad. Dean is an artist who deals mostly with large metal sculptures. I mean, what am I? A junkman who makes art or an artist who sells junk? You tell me. So you see, he has lots of metal sitting around. Perfect for snacking.Meanwhile, after reports of spotting the giant, a call is made and fast-talking government agent Kent Mansley (Christopher McDonald) rushes right over to get to the bottom of things. With his initial disbelief, Kent spends his time making quips about the small town. Gems like The biggest thing in this town is probably the homecoming queen. After a close encounter with a car that appears to be bitten in half, Kent catches on to the situation. He knows that Hogarth is hiding the iron giant and won't stop until he is discovered and destroyed.The movie is full of funny and endearing moments. A couple personal favorites include the scene in which Hogarth, Dean, and the iron giant go swimming. When the giant robot does a cannonball into the lake, hilarity ensues. The heart-to-heart scene that Hogarth has with the iron giant about death is also heart-warming. Souls don't die.

Annie and Dean are admiring what she says is his best work yet. A sculpture of the iron giant. Hogarth is given the only piece of the giant that was recovered, and is delighted when it lights up and jumps out the window.

She could be, and was, scathingly, bitterly, ironically funny in the face of the daily potential for disaster, of the mine killing her husband and setting the family adrift. If the father was a force to be reckoned with, wait'll you meet Homer's actual mother, not the Mrs. Cleaver version they depicted in October Sky the movie.

A movie the whole family can watch together...just not Homer's real family, who were if anything, more dysfunctional than most.

It stars Giancarlo Gianinni as the title character, Shirley Stoler, Fernando Rey, and a host of excellent supporting actresses and actors. The film got Wertmuller the first nomination of a woman as Best Director for the Oscars. Her use of music and silence is brilliant.Seven Beauties starts with our hero on the lam in Germany, an Italian soldier trying to desert to his home in Napoli. In flashbacks throughout the film, we see episodes of Pasqualino Seven Beauties before the war as a young man with aspirations to the Mob. Through a series of misadventures involving murder and an insane asylum, Pasqualino ends up in the Italian army in Germany, where he promptly deserts. The Germans capture him and send him to a concentration camp. Throughout the film, in flashbacks and in the present, Pasqualino's goal is to live. And he gets his wish. Naturally, much goes on in the years between the Thirties and the Forties, when the film ends. Wertmuller is relentless in her hatred of the Nazis and the Fascists. There is enough polemic in the film to get her point across, but not so didactically that it becomes preachy. Some of the characters clearly have no point but to show the intelligence of socialism or the bravery of honor. But what Pasqualino has to show us is the squalor and degradation of the Nazis.If the purpose of good literature is to show us the development of character, Wertmuller shows it in spades through Pasqualino and his family. The price of staying alive is high.SPOILERS In a flashback the movie shows us Pasqualino, his mother, and his sisters during the Depression before World War II. They live in Napoli, and his mother is widowed, so Pasqualino assumes that the's head of the family. Although they are poor, Pasqualino is very happy. He dresses well, he carries a gun, and he feels respected. His oldest sister, however, is 38, and she feels spinsterhood approaching. She's fat and ugly and has no prospects. She falls for a pimp who tells her he'll make her a star and then he'll marry her. Her goal in life is to feel loved, she falls for his line, and he puts her on stage in a skimpy costume then into a brothel. Prostitution is a metaphor throughout Wertmuller's movie. Pasqualino murders the pimp, disposes of the body, is caught and confesses. Told by his lawyer that his only chance to avoid the death penalty is to plead insanity, Pasqualino refuses, claiming the family's honor is more important. Awaiting trial, however, Pasqualino realizes that life is better than an honorable death, and he begins spouting Il Duce's speeches to his fellow inmates. His lawyer gets him sentenced to treatment in an asylum. Staying alive, too, is a repeating theme in Seven Beauties. Wertmuller realized that one of the genius ideas of the Nazis was to make us all complicit in their atrocities. Throughout the movie, Pasqualino observes atrocities and remains silent over the objections of others around him. Eventually his silent acquiescence leads to action, as he becomes a participant in the murders of those imprisoned with him. While others choose honorable death, Pasqualino chooses to remain alive. It's not a bargain with the devil. It's not a choice we can blame on others. It's the choice of Pasqualino. To live, he has to prostitute himself to the Nazi camp commandant. Seven Beauties is an indictment of the Nazis and all their fellow travelers, but an understanding one. Sergei Eisenstein showed us in Battleship Potemkin that the drama lies in individual stories not in masses, and Wertmuller shows us the corruption of all of Germany through the individual story of Pasqualino. The Nazi path is a 12-step program which leads not to recovery and redemption but to the sickness that was the Nazi party. Blind obedience to the Nazis leads to hell. Pasqualino's wish to live was granted, and the Furies will hound him with the living hell of his memories.After you've seen Seven Beauties, watch Catch 22 and pay attention to Yossarian's conversation with the old Italian man.For serious students, I recommend reading a short article about Mel Brooks at the US News archives where Brooks says you can't take on monsters like Hitler in a direct manner -- they'll always win if you take them seriously and argue their behavior with them. Hitler was famous for seducing his listeners with his rhetoric. Brooks believes the only way to win against tyrants is to mock them and show how crazy they are. Brooks says he attacks the horror of the holocaust with the only weapon that works - ridicule of the perpetrators. Was Wertmuller mocking the Nazis with Seven Beauties?Then contrast Brooks's view with that of Bruno Bettelheim in his essay about Seven Beauties called Surviving. Brooks served in the army in World War II and saw the streams of refugees but not the concentration camps. Bettelheim is, as he put it, one of the all too few survivors of the camps. Bettelheim's view of the film and its comic aspects is one of outrage and disgust. Actually, I'm not sure outrage is strong enough to describe his feeling. He excoriates Wertmuller and everyone who gave the film a good review. I contemplated a meaningful dialogue between Mel Brooks and Bettelheim, but I'm not sure it could have happened, given Bettelheim's experience. He was a professor of psychology at the University of Chicago after his escape to America, and he practiced at a school for emotionally disturbed children. Bettelheim's specialty was treatment of the autistic. Unsurprisingly, he suffered from depression. In 1990 at the age of 86 he committed suicide - he was widowed and suffering from the effects of a major stroke.

Look, the reviews don't give more then 5 or 6 which isn't that good. This last in the series, as they told us then, was directed by Joseph Zito. He just delivered us The Prowler (1981) together with effects from Tom Savini. He was asked to direct part 4 and he asked Tom back again. The Prowler was released in the UK under the alternative title of Rosemary's Killer and suffered various cuts including a pitchfork into the stomach, a carving knife plunged through the top of a man's head and then slowly withdrawn, and a woman's throat being sawn with a knife in a swimming pool. Another famous shot was the fingers being cut by the killer. Savini still says that this was his best work. So again, i thought, well, they combine again so it will be worth watching. But on that point it failed again. Again, it starts with flashbacks taken from earlier parts. The killings itself aren't that gory as in The Prowler but you can see that Savini enjoyed his work here. The reason he agreed to do Friday part 4 was that he created Jason and thought that it would be fine to end the circle and kill him. Those parts were Jason is killed are well done and gory. The machete in Jason's hand and the machete in his head, well, that's what I call horror. again, it takes a while before things happen, okay, from the beginning you have some killings, the most famous one the banana and the hitch hiker but then again, it's a lot of talking and getting to know the characters. So far it's also the part with the most gratuitous nudity. Acting is okay but one person do pops up, Corey Feldman. he was just a child then but his performance is excellent. He even had a shaved head and the look at the end in his eyes is sublime. It's always creepy to see a child with a machete walking around. Be sure to pick up the Deluxe edition. It has some nice dailies sadly without sound but you can see, and hear Zito, talk about those outtakes why they didn't use it, even as they are more gory. There is even an alternative ending, again without sound but with the director telling why it was cut out. It's nice to see it, the best one so far due the last 25 minutes.

","genre":"Horror, Thriller"},{"date":"20 January 2011","score":"","review":" Alfred Hitchcock is one of a very small number of directors whose career spans the entire classic era, beginning during the silent period and ending after the abolition of the production code. Frenzy is his first, as it were, post-code movie, when restrictions upon violence, profanity and sexual content were lifted. Frenzy takes advantage of all three liberties.The screenplay for this one was written by the brilliant Anthony Schaffer, he of Sleuth and The Wicker Man, specifically for Hitchcock. As it's a made-to-measure job, Schaffer (who shared many of the director's sensibilities) seems to have set out to craft the archetypal Hitchcockian thriller. Adapting from a novel by Arthur La Bern with some significant changes, Schaffer has concocted a tale full of morbid sensationalism, in which people seem intrigued rather than horrified by the spate of grisly murders. Unlike the Hitchcock heroes of the previous few decades as would be played by the perfectly likable Cary Grant or Jimmy Stewart, Dick Blaney is a severely flawed hero &#x96; short-tempered, spiteful, a drinker. And yet Schaffer quickly introduces him as likable not by what he does, but by showing him in his first scene being berated by an even more miserable looking Bernard Cribbins, and then consoled by the sweet and pretty Anna Massey. If Cribbins is his enemy and Massey his girlfriend, we think to ourselves, this guy can't be too bad.This less restricted era of filmmaking demonstrates to us the sort of thing Hitch would have normally wanted in his pictures had he the chance, with plenty of nudity and graphic brutality. And yet the Master of Suspense&#x99; is never gratuitous or completely explicit. In the first rape and murder scene, Hitch uses a series of images &#x96; eyes, hands etc &#x96; to give you an impression of the event, just as he did with the shower scene in Psycho a decade earlier. The only difference is that at the time of Psycho he would not have been able to display the victim's exposed breasts. The result is easily the most disturbing sequence Hitch ever created, the implied sexual element giving it that extra wave of unpleasantness. Much has been made of the second murder, which takes place offscreen and it is indeed masterly how Hitch does this with the renowned tracking shot retreating down the stairs. What is great is the way the scene begins, with another tracking shot showing killer and victim walking through the realistic bustle of Covent Garden, which leads us into this feeling that we are accompanying the victim, and may see her managing to escape. Then when the camera tracks away, there is this awful feeling of helplessness, as if we've abandoned her. The trick is complete as the noise and crowds of the street reappear, as if to smother out the crime.A somewhat different kind of cast is assembled for this Hitchcock jaunt. Hitch usually went for well-known stars with an established persona, which he could play on or subvert. The faces here are less familiar, and this now being an era where actors are expected to be versatile they come with no strings attached, as it were. At first we genuinely can't tell who is the good guy and who is the bad. Sadly Jon Finch gives a rather awkward, overwrought performance, and it occurs to me that if he isn't convincing to the audience what hope would his character have with the police? But never mind, it's a mainly decent bunch otherwise. Barry Foster is superb, portraying this believable easygoing façade, then effortlessly sliding into anger and creepiness. Next best is Barbara Leigh-Hunt, who has in many ways the most difficult role, but manages to make a real impact, and not just in the most obvious scene but before that.Of course what also makes this cast very different is that they are all English. This was Hitchcock's first British production in over forty years. The director had learnt a lot in that time, and regulations had certainly changed and yet it seems in many ways Frenzy has more in common with those earlier British films. Perhaps it's the lively London setting and the brassy Cockney accents, but it's also that gleeful grimness, such as the cheerful discussion about murderous psychopaths in the pub, or simply how businesslike everyone is about a serial killer stalking the streets. There are links here to similar scenes in The Lodger (1927) and Blackmail (1929), and really Frenzy is little more than a modern version of these pictures, with the addition of the odd naked female and a handful of four-letter words.

Frenzy takes advantage of all three liberties.The screenplay for this one was written by the brilliant Anthony Schaffer, he of Sleuth and The Wicker Man, specifically for Hitchcock. As it's a made-to-measure job, Schaffer (who shared many of the director's sensibilities) seems to have set out to craft the archetypal Hitchcockian thriller. Adapting from a novel by Arthur La Bern with some significant changes, Schaffer has concocted a tale full of morbid sensationalism, in which people seem intrigued rather than horrified by the spate of grisly murders. Unlike the Hitchcock heroes of the previous few decades as would be played by the perfectly likable Cary Grant or Jimmy Stewart, Dick Blaney is a severely flawed hero &#x96; short-tempered, spiteful, a drinker. And yet Schaffer quickly introduces him as likable not by what he does, but by showing him in his first scene being berated by an even more miserable looking Bernard Cribbins, and then consoled by the sweet and pretty Anna Massey. If Cribbins is his enemy and Massey his girlfriend, we think to ourselves, this guy can't be too bad.This less restricted era of filmmaking demonstrates to us the sort of thing Hitch would have normally wanted in his pictures had he the chance, with plenty of nudity and graphic brutality. And yet the Master of Suspense&#x99; is never gratuitous or completely explicit. In the first rape and murder scene, Hitch uses a series of images &#x96; eyes, hands etc &#x96; to give you an impression of the event, just as he did with the shower scene in Psycho a decade earlier. The only difference is that at the time of Psycho he would not have been able to display the victim's exposed breasts. The result is easily the most disturbing sequence Hitch ever created, the implied sexual element giving it that extra wave of unpleasantness. Much has been made of the second murder, which takes place offscreen and it is indeed masterly how Hitch does this with the renowned tracking shot retreating down the stairs. What is great is the way the scene begins, with another tracking shot showing killer and victim walking through the realistic bustle of Covent Garden, which leads us into this feeling that we are accompanying the victim, and may see her managing to escape. Then when the camera tracks away, there is this awful feeling of helplessness, as if we've abandoned her. The trick is complete as the noise and crowds of the street reappear, as if to smother out the crime.A somewhat different kind of cast is assembled for this Hitchcock jaunt. Hitch usually went for well-known stars with an established persona, which he could play on or subvert. The faces here are less familiar, and this now being an era where actors are expected to be versatile they come with no strings attached, as it were. At first we genuinely can't tell who is the good guy and who is the bad. Sadly Jon Finch gives a rather awkward, overwrought performance, and it occurs to me that if he isn't convincing to the audience what hope would his character have with the police? But never mind, it's a mainly decent bunch otherwise. Barry Foster is superb, portraying this believable easygoing façade, then effortlessly sliding into anger and creepiness. Next best is Barbara Leigh-Hunt, who has in many ways the most difficult role, but manages to make a real impact, and not just in the most obvious scene but before that.Of course what also makes this cast very different is that they are all English. This was Hitchcock's first British production in over forty years. The director had learnt a lot in that time, and regulations had certainly changed and yet it seems in many ways Frenzy has more in common with those earlier British films. Perhaps it's the lively London setting and the brassy Cockney accents, but it's also that gleeful grimness, such as the cheerful discussion about murderous psychopaths in the pub, or simply how businesslike everyone is about a serial killer stalking the streets. There are links here to similar scenes in The Lodger (1927) and Blackmail (1929), and really Frenzy is little more than a modern version of these pictures, with the addition of the odd naked female and a handful of four-letter words.

It starts with an American couple in Paris and a disappearance that comes out of a scene that seems to be shot from the point of view of De Palma, from behind the glass panel door of a shower, then Harrison Ford is approaching hotel personnel to ask about his missing wife, the otherworldly facade of the exotic backdrop is peeled to reveal from behind the mystique of Old Europe. Polanski's Paris, indeed the Paris of the Surrealists of the 1920's and earlier, is a Paris to lose yourself in. It's a place charming if you snap photos to show back home, mysterious if you wander it. I love the disorientation on Ford's face for the first half hour, partly because it seems to be reflected on the face of the actor as much as the face of the character, how much he's out of his depth in this city of lights that don't always sparkle. It's funny how he thinks money will buy his way out of this, and for that moment when this naive doctor is being sold cocaine in the toilet of a club, I was curious to see how deep he would get into that world.But then the wife's disappearance is not thrown to the side for Polanski to tell us more about someone trapped in a world of illusions like he did in The Tenant.

In North by Northwest it was a microfilm of important secrets, here it's a microdevice that detonates nuclear bombs. In a rooftop sequence of very easy suspense (will he fall down or won't he?) we are reminded again that Polanski is riffing on Hitchcock.

With Frantic I feel he's stooping down to something that is beneath his talents.

In 1992, no one heard you scream&#x85;in the theatre.2. They didn't learn from Alien³ with Terminator 3, which ruined the notion of No fate but what we make set forth in Terminator 2. Alien³ follows suit in just the first 10 minutes by tossing out all you cared about Aliens.3. Incredibly, I originally gave this movie 5 out of 5 stars. I was 18 then and 18 years later, I've grown up, opened my eyes and tried to remember what kinds of drugs I was inhaling back then.4. Mostly, I'll recommend the Uncut\/Unrated\/Unclothed Special Editions of movies. In Alien³, you must skip it at all costs. An additional 31 USELESS minutes were added and in this special edition, they mercilessly deleted the only thing the ending had going for it the chest-burst.5. Speaking of useless minutes, in the so-called Special Edition there's a successful trap set for the alien. In one of the brainless ideas caught on screenplay paper, it's released. Thank God for editors for theatrical releases.6. While I thoroughly praised Aliens, I feel I was enormously harsh on the original Alien. After #3, I deserve to be shot for saying anything against the original.7. Ripley (Weaver) went from housewife to warrior with her G.I. Jane 'do...until&#x85;she bellied over in what appears to be PMS cramps for the other 90% of the movie. Yeah. That's both tough and appealing.8. Who cares if your previous installment makes $131 million worldwide &#x96; which, by the way, was good for 1986&#x85;the suits will always try and tear down the budget for a part III by turning the realistic alien creatures into&#x85;cartoons&#x85;?9. Alien³ had flat out hilarious alien scenes (when they're chomping away or in the distance.) Today we would call it CGI, in 1992, it was called animated. And poorly.10. Weaver only saw green ($$) for Alien³. She obviously decided she was in it for the money. Joke's on her this was the lowest grossing of the first three. Hell, it barely reached $55 million, which, by the way, was still bad in 1992.11. The original premise of Alien³ was for it to be set on earth, and unbelievably, they released even teasers for that idea.

You really just have to see it to understand it.Sometimes in my own life I feel this sense of alienation from the world and wonder about why things are happening the way they are and what I'm doing here. Safe sort of made me think about that in that if I was allergic to things that make up such an important part of my life, what would I be doing if that happened.Julianne Moore is a stunning actress and this film highlights how convincing she can be as a character that makes subtlety so loud in a performance.This film will make you think a lot, but perhaps it will make you think for good reasons.

Gleaming The Cube was just one of many films that had us acting like this in our youth.Having just finished watching Gleaming The Cube for the first time in years I realised two things. 1. It doesn't have the same hold over me as it once did (but really why should it? I'm not ten anymore). 2. It isn't anywhere near as bad as some of the reviews I've read over the years.Starring one of my all time favourites 'Christian Slater' in the lead role of Brian and starring no-one else worth mentioning, Gleaming The Cube is without doubt the best skateboard\/mystery\/drama that the world has ever produced. Slater spends his usual amount of time trying to pull of intense 'Jack Nicholson' style faces, but that's one of the things I always loved about him.When Brian's stepbrother is found dead, the police say its suicide but Brian thinks different, so he sets out on his skateboard and tries to solve the mystery of his death. That's basically it as far as plot goes, but the film is carried forward with chase scenes and skateboarding action.All in all it's everything an 80's skateboarding film should be. And I like it.

That's not very easy to do. Most sequels are terrible, made only to bank on the original movie's ideas without introducing anything new.T2 Judgment Day is not an original movie because of its plot, or its idea but it is actually groundbreaking in terms of special effects. I do not like movies that rely on special effects alone for its appeal. There must be more to a movie than just special effects. And T2 delivers it.T2 is a special movie This is, I believe, the first time CGI was used. Prior to T2, you could easily make out the image that was pasted to the film. The graphic image would stick out like a sore thumb, its contour easily traceable by naked eye.With T2, CGI (computer generated imagery) technique has evolved to such a level that creating any image and adding it to the film became possible. And this is done so well, there is really no way of telling it apart from the original film like you could do in movies prior to T2. Contour lines are no longer visible, they are much smoother and blend with the original film.As for the story, it is almost the repeat to the original movie and there are many parallel scenes. Again two characters fighting each other for the fate of Sarah O'Connor, wait, this time for John O'Connor (Sarah's son); that is one main difference. So we have a new character added to the story. We have a more sophisticated terminator, T1000, the indestructible liquid man - thanks to CGI effects. We get to see the character who is responsible for building the micro-processor that gave birth to SKYNET, the evil mainframe that declared war on humanity.One thing I would like to emphasize is the performance of Robert Patrick, the actor who portrays T1000. His acting is simply fascinating and, in my opinion, is the reason why this movie works so well. A lot of the people are impresses by the CGI, rightfully so, and forget to give credit where its due. Robert Patrick brought T1000 alive. Without his impeccable performance, the movie would fall flat, even CGI couldn't save the movie. His brute looks, his robotic but finely-tuned moves, his cunning ways were just what this movie needed.After T2, there were two more franchise movies, T3-The Rise of the Machines and Terminator Salvation.
