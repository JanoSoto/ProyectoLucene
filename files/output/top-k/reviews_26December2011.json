A nearby research observatory run by cosmic ray scientist Professor Crevett (Warren Mitchell) has detected a strange cloud that seems to be hovering at the peak of the mountain, Crevett sends for UN scientist Alan Brooks (Forrest Tucker) who arrives is shown the cloud & informed that is is radioactive. The cloud starts move down the mountain as more people turn up dead, finally the scientists realise that they are dealing with hostile aliens that want to take over the world.This British made sci-fi horror film was released in the US under the more sensationalistic title of The Crawling Eye & was cut down from 84 minutes to 75 minutes by the distributors who wanted to get to the alien monsters quicker, the version I will be basing my comment on is the full 84 minute cut under the title The Trollenberg Terror. Directed by Quentin Lawrence from a script by Hammer horror regular Jimmy Sangster this is a fairly decent little sci-fi horror film, the setting helps with it's small isolated village & hazardous mountain terrain & the actual alien monsters are kept off screen until the last fifteen minutes which helps build suspense because when they do make an appearance the special effects are not very special at all. There's a fair amount of theorising going on & huge leaps of logic are made by the character's, it's never really really revealed why the aliens are here anyway apart from a guess by Crevett. There's no explanation as how the aliens decapitated that guy in the log cabin since all the doors were locked from the inside, why did they decapitate people anyway? It moves along at a decent enough pace & has a nice mix of horror & sci-fi but I wouldn't call it a classic. A perfectly fine way to pass 80 odd minutes but not much else, it's fairly predictable & just about meets the genres standards but rarely rises above them if truth be told.Once the alien monsters are seen at the end they look alright when required to do nothing but sit there, when they need to move & act menacing the effects fall apart. The monsters look like giant pulsing brains with an eye & tentacles that are alright conceptually but when brought to life on screen with unconvincing model shots, silly sound effects & tentacles that look more like rope the effective creepiness that the film had built up with it's mystery is lost. The main hero doesn't even really get to fight them as he just ask's for a load of bombs to be dropped, The Trollenberg Terror never quite comes to life. The film was based on an original six part television series made by the BBC called The Trollenberg Terror (1956) which no longer exists, the makers obviously saw the success the Quatermass film had after that too had been adapted from a BBC serial & wanted to cash-in with more of the same. Unusually for a film of this period there's a headless body shown & a decapitated head in a sack.Shot on what was probably a low budget this was filmed in Middlesex here in England. Production values are alright, some of the sets look a little fake & the special effects don't hold up too well but it's a product of it's time & could have been worse. The acting is OK, it's not great but again it could have been worse.The Trollenberg Terror, of the The Crawling Eye if you prefer is a good 50's sci-fi horror film that is of it's time & suffers from the limitations of it. A decent enough way to pass 80 minutes if nothing else.

In the film the two play garbage men who dream of setting up their own surf shop but when they find the body of a man running for Mayor they get involved in a political cover up. If you're looking for some sort of high art or masterpiece of cinema then you're certainly looking in the wrong place. If you just want some cheap, juvenile fun then MEN AT WORK is just for you. I remember being 10-years-old when I first watched this movie and I found it hilarious then and it continues to be a very funny, if incredibly stupid little film. I think what the film has going it its favor is the terrific cast who really dig into their roles. Both Estevez and Sheen have no problem playing together as they have a certain chemistry that could only come from real brothers. It's funny seeing the two work together because you can tell that they know how to bounce off one another and it's clear they know which buttons to push. The screenplay leaves a lot to be desired and you can't help but feel that the two actors make a mediocre story and at least put some energy to it. Another major plus is the supporting performance of David Keith who plays a crazy Vietnam vet who tags along with the two men the day the body is discovered. Keith is hilarious in his scenes and it really pre-dates the type of character he would eventually play in THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY. Just check out the sequence where he has a flashback to his Vietnam days and takes it out on a pizza man. Even Leslie Hope as the love interest comes off well. The biggest thing working against the film is its screenplay because it's just a tad bit too silly for its own good. We get the typical, low-rent type of comedy including the garbage men going up against a couple jerk cops, doing battle with some co-workers and of course there's the hit men that are idiots. MEN AT WORK is certainly far from a classic but it contains some of that 80s comedy that was slowly making its way out of movies by 1990.

Of course, for practical reasons, one cannot award a film ten stars out of ten, because of the endless stream of new work demanding scrutiny. I'd like also to start by quoting another well known film, which sums up my opinion nicely. 'In many ways, the work of a critic is easy- we risk very little, and thrive on negative criticism, which is amusing to write and to read. But the harsh truth of the matter is that the average piece of junk is probably more valuable than our criticism designating it so'. This could not be closer to the truth.

This is probably the reason why this movie has been designated as a cult film, simply because the plot is so cryptic that is exposed to as many interpretations as people who watch it.This is not necessarily bad, in fact it is a good idea, it's a good way to invite people to think, investigate and generate their own conclusions, and to give a mythological touch to the film.I think that in order to form an interpretation of the plot it is necessary to read the excerpts from the book The Philosophy of Time Travel shown in the extras on the director's cuts version DVD. (Just google The Philosophy of Time Travel and you'll find it right away).The characters and situations are sometimes realistic and sometimes surreal, at the point it made me doubt several times if the plot was developed in reality or a dream or imagination of the protagonist. I guess in the end it's up to each one to choose which of the two is.The dialogues seemed good in general, and credible.The direction is very good, and as some say, is hard to believe it's the director's first film (Richard Kelly).

I really liked the raw approach of the movie and its drama and the way it got shot. It had a great visual and also original style to it, which reminded me of some true guerrilla-style of film-making, with quick cuts and an always moving- and hand-held camera. The movie made the impression as if most of it was thought up at the spot. I'm not just talking about the way the camera swirls around but also about most of its dialog and of the way the story was progressing. And it's a Lars von Trier movie, so lots of it was probably indeed improvised on the spot but this only really seems to be the case for the first 30\/45 minutes of the movie.After that the story and the movie its style and tone changes. Suddenly some musical elements start to kick in, which is something that still could had worked for me, if the songs had been any good. But man, were they annoying. There is no clear melody in any of them and nothing memorable is being sung.But also the story itself is suddenly taking a far more straightforward, dramatic approach, instead of coming across as a realistic, random slice of life. The developments that start to happen in this movie just weren't any ones I was really pleased with. I know Lars von Trier is a type of director that likes to tell stories in which when something starts to go wrong for a person, everything goes wrong and no person can ever be trusted. I however felt in this case that it just wasn't all that convincing and at a certain point I even simply stopped caring for its main character because she isn't really always doing the smartest things.The main character is basically a very naive person, who probably trust people far too easily. On the one hand this makes her very likable and sympathetic, since she comes across as a happy-go-lucky type of girl, who is always focusing on the positive things on life but on the other it's what also makes her a bit annoying at times, also because of some of the, all too obvious, stupid choices she makes.I don't really think you could fault Björk for any of this. It was just the way her character was being written and for most of the time Björk is playing it very well, especially when considering she wasn't really an actress to being with. Björk, the popular Icelandic singer, did not made her debut in this movie but it was the first time she was playing with some already established names in the business. In that regard, she did really well, though she is also still dropping the ball a bit at times. It seems that she was great and feeling comfortable improvising but when she had to remember lines and say them in the movie, she was having some more difficulties. Her unusual accent also really makes it sound as if she had no idea what she was saying, most of the time. But obviously I could still really appreciate this movie and have lots of respect for it. It's mostly because Dancer in the Dark is a movie like no other. It's being original with its style and approach, I just didn't ended up liking EVERYTHING this movie was doing but that of course doesn't mean that other people will do so as well.

You know there was so much there but so little of it can ever be seen in the final cut. Not with Moulin Rouge! Watching Every frame, every word, every song is like soaking yourself in a bath of creativity where there were no rules or if there was, they were often invisible.The Oscar (won for Best Production design) is rightly claimed. Whilst the performances, music and cinematography are all excellent, it's the unique designs that really jump out of the screen throughout the entire film.

For this reason, Moulin will never be what it could have been - and stands as a warning to anyone who plans to outstay their welcome at a Fox studio.Still, it was good enough for an Oscar, and I guess (being in the department that earned it that Oscar) I should be (and am) satisfied. I do sometimes wonder what it might have looked like though had the producers gone ahead with their initial plans to build a full size outdoor back lot, thus avoiding the troubles at Fox and obviating the need for all that expensive mucking about with scale models afterwards.Moulin was a wild ride (both on and off screen) and I'll never forget it.And I guarantee, neither will you.Enjoy.

As a result of this two major key sets were demolished well before time and well before it was possible to create the necessary special effect shots needed to bring the film to reality.This resulted in the construction of a number of additional scale models (at another studio) which were inevitably used for these mo-con shots - and resulted in the famed longest mo con shots in film for this week.To most viewers, Moulin seems fine. But to me, and despite enormous effort to prevent it, the continuous multitude of continuity and lighting errors that abound in Moulin (where scenes cut back and forth from the real life to the model sets) is an ever present annoyance, preventing me from ever fully entering the director's intended world as it was planned to be. For this reason, Moulin will never be what it could have been - and stands as a warning to anyone who plans to outstay their welcome at a Fox studio.Still, it was good enough for an Oscar, and I guess (being in the department that earned it that Oscar) I should be (and am) satisfied. I do sometimes wonder what it might have looked like though had the producers gone ahead with their initial plans to build a full size outdoor back lot, thus avoiding the troubles at Fox and obviating the need for all that expensive mucking about with scale models afterwards.Moulin was a wild ride (both on and off screen) and I'll never forget it.And I guarantee, neither will you.Enjoy.

My idol if you will. The guy puts his all into everything he touches. His energy and attention to detail are rarely matched. And he consistently churns out one solid movie after another, with even his lesser works (Gangs of New York (2002), Shutter Island (2010) standing out above almost everything else that comes out in terms of quality. While his movies are consistently solid even if not always perfect, more than a few have stood out as timeless, essential classics that will forever go down in film history. Goodfellas (1990) and Taxi Driver (1976) are widely noted as being arguably the greatest films of their respective decades. His greatest masterpiece, Raging Bull (1984), follows in this tradition. It's the best movie of the 80's.Scorsese brings us the life of middleweight boxing champion Jake LaMotta, one of the least likable protagonists in cinematic history, in a way that makes us fully sympathize with him. That alone is a testament to Scorsese's power as a director, but it's also no coincidence that Scorsese's holy trinity all star Robert DeNiro. Without DeNiro, there'd be no Raging Bull, literally and figuratively. This is a passion project between two friends that went a long way, and that passion shows in every beautifully crafted image. And Robert DeNiro's performance is the stuff of legends, easily one of the top five performances ever caught on film. If LaMotta had been played by anyone else, he most likely would have come off as a soulless thug, not worth caring about. DeNiro plays it differently.Jake LaMotta is a born champion in the boxing ring, with a knack for fiercely annihilating his opponents. He is becoming a true star in the sport. Life should be good. But it isn't, and it never really has been. Jake LaMotta is a completely insecure and self-destructive individual with a brutal temper. His friends and family, though they care about him, are always on their toes and watching what they say around him. His emotional instability causes him to destroy his relationships with everyone close to him. He truly thinks that he loves his wife, Vickie, and she honestly wants to see the good in him. His brother Joey stands by him, isn't afraid of him, and tries to keep him in line while managing his boxing career. But when Jake begins to suspect that Joey and Vickie are having an affair, the rage that leads him to the top in the ring begins to seep into his personal life, worse so than ever before. It may even mean the last straw for the eternally patient Joey.The story works because it explores the soul of a hopeless misanthrope without judging him. You feel like you better understand certain people after experiencing Raging Bull. Jake is as three- dimensional as characters come. Despite his inability to be a good person, his desire to do good is always clear. So is Jake a bad person? More a pathetic one. He's his own worst enemy, and that's why we can't completely fault him. This is what Scorsese and DeNiro clearly understood. The movie doesn't tell you what to think of him, and DeNiro doesn't play it any certain way. Raging Bull simply is LaMotta's life, and DeNiro is LaMotta.Contrary to popular belief, Raging Bull isn't really a boxing movie. The boxing scenes occupy only a few minutes of screen time, and there is no big match to determine the fate of the characters. It's a character movie, and boxing is the only thing that keeps the character going. As far as the fight scenes go however, they are as good as they've ever been done. The black and white cinematography compliments them very well. It emphasizes the splattering blood which appears as black and thick as Hershey's syrup. Also different from other boxing dramas is the lack of crowd participation in the fights. Rather than focus equally on the drama in and out of the ring, Scorsese's camera puts you right in the ring with the fighters. Every punch is felt, and as brief as they are, the scenes leave you feeling bruised. They're as raw as it gets.I could pontificate on this movie's endless list of quality attributes for pages and pages. I'll close by saying that Raging Bull is quite possibly the greatest movie from the greatest living filmmaker. It's cinematic art at it's highest form, a tone poem, a character study, and a biography all flawlessly rolled into one majestic package. Unless you're offended by raw language and uncensored depictions of the uglier side of life, there's essentially nothing to complain about when it comes to Raging Bull. 10\/10.

To me, this movie wasn't really like a sequel. It was like Columbia Pictures decided to reinvent Ghost Busters (1984) by changing the visuals. Yes there are different things in the plot, for example, it's set five years later, Sigourney Weaver's character has a baby, and the Ghost Busters have to restore their names to New York by saving the city like they did five years before. But none of these minor changes made me feel like I was watching anything new.For the cast of this movie, all the same the actors reprise their roles. That is a good thing, because replacing actors for the same character doesn't end well most of the time; but this is not the case. You would think though the writers to this film would do something extraordinary with the characters, but no. Instead we seem to get a rehash from the first film. I enjoyed the original Ghost Busters to a point. It was funny but I did not think it was AS funny as everyone claimed it to be.As for the special effects, I felt that director Ivan Reitman had an ambitious concept and used it well. Although it still did not raise my interest of the movie to a higher level, it definitely kept me paying attention to what was happening on screen. Much of the effects in this movie deal with slime. Watching the slime ooze and sludge all over town reminded me of The Blob (1988), but in a less graphic sense. I'm curious if Dan Aykroyd borrowed this idea from that movie. I would like to know how they even cleaned the mess up. I can't tell which would have been more difficult; cleaning the mess in the first movie with the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, or the slime. I'd pick the marshmallow, at least you can eat that.Finally, the parts in the movie that were supposed to be funny did make me laugh, but still, not enough. And although I cannot count exactly how many times I chuckled, it felt like the same amount of times as I did for the first film. It still was funny but I was hoping Ghost Busters II would have turned my opinion around on the first one. Instead, it left me in the same vicinity as the first one.

Few films are like the wonderful After Life.This Japanese movie provides viewers with a very particular interpretation of just what happens to people when they die but it uses the premise to remind everyone of the joys of life and love and small pleasures. Think of Amelie with ghosts and without the added sweetness that many seem to resent and you're getting closer.It turns out that when you die you don't go to heaven or hell. You go to a building full of counsellors who are all there to help you with the one, most important, thing - picking your favourite ever memory and recreating it for you. Because then, and only then, can you move on and you will keep that one memory with you forever. Nothing else.Written and directed by Hirokazu Koreeda, After Life is a movie that really captures fleeting moments and feelings quite unlike most other movies. Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind came to life, as did It's A Wonderful Life, as did Perfume The Story Of A Murderer and Amer (as much as I disliked that one). This movie just somehow manages to turn the ethereal, intangible fabric of memories and sensations into things that you can feel emanating from the screen.I was about to go to great lengths to check out just who was who in the acting credits and to overcome my ignorance of those involved but that would be a bit pointless in this instance because a) my ignorance seems to grow, exponentially and paradoxically, with my knowledge and b) everyone is just perfect so it's quite impossible to single anyone out. Erika Oda and Arata seem to get many of the better moments but Susumu Terajima, Kei Tani and everyone portraying a dead person struggling to pick a perfect memory all do brilliant work.Gentle, moving, effective and yet not dripping with false sweetness and emotional manipulation, After Life really is something quite special and well worth seeking out. It feels as unique and fragile as the precious memories it focuses on. Do see it.

It's a very short film, running at barely over an hour in length, and it's a very simple film (focusing on a baby elephant who happens to be born with bigger ears than most and who keeps being pushed away by others who just find him to be an object of ridicule) but it's also a very, very sweet film.When thinking about the Disney movies I love the most (Pinocchio, Dumbo, The Jungle Book, etc) I realise that I identify most with the tales of young children, and usually young boys, learning about the world that they're moving in to and making mistakes along the way. The princess tales and the romantic stuff were always, surely, destined to appeal more to the girls but we boys always knew just what it was to stay out extra late playing football, to stray into the areas that we were told to stay away from and to try and put ourselves on a par with bigger folk around us. This may not sound overly familiar to those watching Disney movies but, in many ways, those topics are certainly covered. Falling from the tree and ripping your jeans when your mother told you not to go climbing? The walk home is expressed in every single Disney character who ever has that moment of guilt and shame and regret and fear all rolled into one.Young Dumbo even, although it's unintentional, gets involved in some underage drinking, leading to the Pink Elephants On Parade scene, which remains an absolute highlight of fluid, comedic, strangely surreal, animation. And then he ends up somewhere and can't remember how he got there. And then some people jokingly refer to the idea that maybe he can fly, what with those big ears an' all. Despite the fact that we're talking about Dumbo the baby elephant, his friend Timothy Q. Mouse and a bunch of singing crows, it could be any Saturday or Sunday morning in the life of a teenager who has accidentally gone over the top while trying the forbidden pleasure of alcohol. Which is just one of the many reasons why these layered movies can so easily stand the test of time.Dealing with themes of awkwardness, rejection by social cliques, embracing your unique attributes and more, while also featuring at least two fantastic songs (When I See An Elephant Fly and Pink Elephants On Parade) and a number of other pleasing tunes and at least one mildly scary moment (those pink elephants again), Dumbo easily earns the title Disney classic and will, I hope, entertain young and old for many years to come.

You can't have the same actors in a movie this late if one is a pre-adolescent kid growing up.

Long story short, Weaver was excellent as usual, Charles Dutton and Charles Dance were both great. The other actors all tended to blend in together, however.

It isn't a bad movie. It's got a decent enough cast but I found the story to be somewhat lacking, giving that cast little to work with. As a comedy, this wasn't really all that funny and as a romance, for me at least the match of James Stewart and Kim Novak just didn't work. Stewart (at age 50) seemed much too old for the role he was playing, especially teamed with Novak, who would have been 25 years his junior. I don't object to the age difference; I just found that it caused me to have doubts. Given her character's background, I could perhaps understand the decision to match Novak with an older, more mature type, but it was more Stewart that I found awkward in the role. It wasn't their performances. Both were fine in that regard. It was simply that the romantic match didn't work for me.Novak's character of Gil was a witch who found herself falling for Stewart's Spencer, a very human publisher engaged to be married to someone else. In something of a theme, Janice Rule, who played his fiancé, was 23 years younger than Stewart. Obviously, those who made this movie really wanted Stewart, in spite of the awkwardness that they surely must have known would be created by the age difference! Gil's problem was that a witch can't fall in love according to this story (or, at least, if she does, she loses her powers.) She places a spell on Spencer because she likes him, and manages to create enough havoc in his relationship with Merle (Rule) that they break up, but Spencer is confused by her seeming inability to really connect emotionally with him. Eventually, Spencer finds out the truth and finds a senior witch (played by Hermione Gingold) to release him from Gil's spell, while Gil finally admits that she's in love. With her powers gone and the spell on Spencer broken, these two finally have the chance to develop an honest relationship.Director Richard Quine did a good job of developing the character of Gil. Emotionally distant perhaps, Gil is still a sultry and exotic figure, the point being simply made by having her barefoot in many of her scenes. Stewart - as he often is - is pleasant enough to watch and has a bit of an aura of confusion about him as he deals with everything that's going on that's gradually turning his life upside down. The film also features good supporting performances from folks such as Jack Lemmon as Gil's brother Nicky and Elsa Lanchester as her Aunt Queenie. I wondered as I was watching this how much of an influence it may have been on the 60's sitcom Bewitched. I know that show was supposed to have been directly based on 1942's I Married A Witch, but there seemed enough similarities to this concept to believe that it at least was in the back of the minds of the creators of that show.

I really wished the characters were all developed a little, and that Karate Kid's (Ralph Macchio) acting was better - it was painful at times. All in all, pretty good... not unbearable. It is understandable why many see 'The Outsiders' as an 80's classic, and well, I much prefer it to 'The Breakfast Club'.

However the execution was not up to scratch; the acting felt contrived and speech felt false and at times unbelievable.

The characters were empathy worthy however I wished that the relationships between the brothers were developed further.
