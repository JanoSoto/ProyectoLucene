This movie is a cloying, annoying dud...the sort of contrived mess of a film that makes you want to tell Hollywood to STOP making holiday movies if this is the sort of crap they think the public could want! The film begins with Hulk Hogan playing some sort of combination rich guy, superhero, GI Joe wannabe and ninja. I am glad that his impressions of himself and his abilities are not in any way over-ambitious or egocentric! In a stupid freak accident, the Hulkster now thinks he's Santa and comes to the aid...I kid you not...of a home for orphans!! Folks, it just doesn't get any worse than this--or does it?! Well, in fact it does. You see, the evil man behind this is, naturally, Ed Begley, Jr. and I assume he wanted this property to build an electric car dealership. But, in a bizarre twist, it's to get a whole bunch of neon-like power crystals hidden in an underground vault! Say what?!?!? Begley's crew of evil villains look like the sort of baddies that might attack Barney the dinosaur. They are all really, really lame and are about as threatening as a mild case of dandruff. And, it's up to Hulk to kick some butt (wow, not a tough thing in this case), win the hearts of a whole bunch of cute moppets AND manage to make a family-friendly movie that involves lots of punching, kicking and other forms of violence! The film has absolutely nothing going for it other than Hogan's massive ego. The acting is crap, the script is crap, the action is crap and there is nothing...I repeat, NOTHING of any value to this steaming pile of....movie. What makes it worse is the 'surprise' twist concerning the villain and Hulk's childhood--which, oddly, neither seemed to remember! Sadly, anyone seeing this turkey of a film will not have the same thing occur--they'll never forget having wasted nearly an hour and a half on this snot-fest. This film easily deserves to be on IMDb's Bottom 100 list, as it's the worst vanity project I've seen in ages--and a family film which is too violent and stupid for kids and just about impossible for any adult to sit through without massive amounts of liquor.My favorite part of the film?

Some could compare Indiana's basketball mania to many southern states and their local devotion to college and high school football. It's more like a secular religion down there.In the early Fifties Gene Hackman has been hired by a local high school to coach its floundering basketball team which is built around one star player, Maris Valainis. Maris's father was the assistant coach and is also the town drunk and is played by Dennis Hopper. He's as jealous as Lloyd Bridges was when Gary Cooper didn't recommend he move up to the job of marshal in High Noon.Barbara Hershey plays a teacher who is worried about Valainis getting a good education and who actually now has custody of the kid because Hopper's been ruled an unfit dad won't let him play. That's the specific problem that Hackman is facing.The general problem is that especially in a small town setting everyone and his brother think they can do a better job than the current athletic coach of whatever sport. Just listen to any sports phone-in show on the radio and you'll have that fact confirmed. Still that's just what comes with the territory. The best character in Hoosiers is without a doubt Hopper. He was a star basketball player in the town and he can't get over the fact that those years in high school were the high point of his life. He never went on to anything else and that's what Hershey is trying to prevent happening with his son. Ironically this same situation is humorously exploited in Married With Children where Al Bundy waxes nostalgically about his high school football days, remember four touchdowns in a single game.In fact Dennis Hopper got an Oscar nomination in the Best Supporting Actor category, one of two that Hoosiers got the other being for best musical scoring. I think Hoosiers misses being a classic though a lot will disagree with me. The characters except for Hopper are not really developed by the script. Other than Valainis the kids on the team have no real individual identities, we never learn just Hackman did that brought him out of college ranks and in the Navy for eleven years between his last college job and this one.The basketball scenes move at a good pace though and Hoosiers is after all about basketball.

In this movie James Bond is assigned to keep an eye on Auric Goldfinger, a wealthy man obsessed with gold. Bond sees him playing cards and quite picky about where he sits to play. Noticing an earpiece, Bond goes up to Goldfinger's hotel room an sees a girl named Jill Masterson helping him cheat with binoculars and a microphone. Bond blackmails him into losing the game and proceeds to have some fun with Jill. Unfortunately, Bond is knocked unconscious and wakes up later to find Jill lying dead from skin suffocation from being completely covered in gold paint, perhaps the most iconic image in the entire series. Bond is then assigned to discover how Goldfinger transports his gold internationally and ends up in a much bigger adventure he expected, stopping him from destroying the gold in Fort Knox and ravaging the economy while increasing the value of his own gold. This is another one of the best of the Bond films with Sean Connery, it's clever, fast paced and one of the most memorable by far. Another thing about this particular movie is that actually lightens up and has its fair share of comical moments.By now, Connery has the role of Bond down flawlessly, he's the tough, resourceful, suave womanizer we all have come to know and love. One of the most defining moments is in the pre-title scene where Bond is on a mission clad in a stealth commando suit and when he is done, he quickly removes it revealing a white tuxedo, this guy is smooth. Gert Frobe is really great as Goldfinger, clever, ruthless, charismatic, and megalomaniacal. His obsession with gold shows even in how he dresses, but not so much that it becomes too gimmicky. Korean weightlifter and wrestler Harold Sakata plays Oddjob, Goldfinger's manservant and henchman with a deadly bowler hat that he throws at his victims like a discuss, usually to break their necks. He never says a word but he has a lot of personality and is always memorable, yet he never overshadows the main villain. Shirley Eaton appears pretty briefly as Jill Masterson, Goldfinger's mistress who after a brief encounter with Bond, is killed by being completely covered in gold paint, perhaps the iconic moment of the series. It's quite a shame that she gets killed off so early, she's really beautiful and has great personality, which makes her fate even more grim. Then there's Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore, and I really wish I was making that up. Pussy is the main Bond girl this time around, she is a villain when he first meet her, sarcastic, tough, and aloof toward Bond, though he tries to make her warm up to him. I still can't believe her name is what it is, even Bond cracks a slight grin when he says her name, I just know Sean Connery wants to laugh every time.We also get the return of Felix Leiter, this time played by Cec Linder. I've got to admit I was glad to see Felix again, he doesn't really do a whole lot, but he still appears often and contributes enough humor and he's actually more likable this time. The locations of the film aren't quite as exotic this time around, we get Miami in the beginning of the film, England as usual, Geneva is as scenic as always and has some great scenes taking place there, Bond is in Kentucky for a big duration of the adventure, especially when it comes around to the battle at Fort Knox. I think the gadgets get a very special use this time, a beautiful Aston Martin complete with rockets, oil slick, and a ejector seat. The action scenes are as cool as always, the pre-title sequence, the car chase, the battle at Fort Knox, it's awesome. Humor is another important factor in this movie, the puns, innuendos, the ejector seat, and shortly before Jill Masterson's demise, a moment where Bond says drinking unchilled wine is like listening to The Beatles without earmuffs. I kid you not, James Bond disses The Beatles, that is hilarious. Another thing I should mention is the scene where Bond and Goldfinger actually go golfing and warn each other that they're aware of each other's motives. Bond sparring with the villain has become a popular and enduring element in the series, usually with a game of cards though. Overall, this is a great movie, it's funny, it's inventive, it has a great sixties charm, it doesn't go on too long, and it's satisfying. Definitely check this one out because it's not only a great Bond film, it's just a great film in general and one of the best in the entire series. Go ahead and give a try, I highly doubt you'll be disappointed.

I still can't believe her name is what it is, even Bond cracks a slight grin when he says her name, I just know Sean Connery wants to laugh every time.We also get the return of Felix Leiter, this time played by Cec Linder. I've got to admit I was glad to see Felix again, he doesn't really do a whole lot, but he still appears often and contributes enough humor and he's actually more likable this time. The locations of the film aren't quite as exotic this time around, we get Miami in the beginning of the film, England as usual, Geneva is as scenic as always and has some great scenes taking place there, Bond is in Kentucky for a big duration of the adventure, especially when it comes around to the battle at Fort Knox. I think the gadgets get a very special use this time, a beautiful Aston Martin complete with rockets, oil slick, and a ejector seat. The action scenes are as cool as always, the pre-title sequence, the car chase, the battle at Fort Knox, it's awesome. Humor is another important factor in this movie, the puns, innuendos, the ejector seat, and shortly before Jill Masterson's demise, a moment where Bond says drinking unchilled wine is like listening to The Beatles without earmuffs. I kid you not, James Bond disses The Beatles, that is hilarious. Another thing I should mention is the scene where Bond and Goldfinger actually go golfing and warn each other that they're aware of each other's motives. Bond sparring with the villain has become a popular and enduring element in the series, usually with a game of cards though. Overall, this is a great movie, it's funny, it's inventive, it has a great sixties charm, it doesn't go on too long, and it's satisfying. Definitely check this one out because it's not only a great Bond film, it's just a great film in general and one of the best in the entire series. Go ahead and give a try, I highly doubt you'll be disappointed.

In this movie James Bond is assigned to keep an eye on Auric Goldfinger, a wealthy man obsessed with gold. Bond sees him playing cards and quite picky about where he sits to play. Noticing an earpiece, Bond goes up to Goldfinger's hotel room an sees a girl named Jill Masterson helping him cheat with binoculars and a microphone. Bond blackmails him into losing the game and proceeds to have some fun with Jill. Unfortunately, Bond is knocked unconscious and wakes up later to find Jill lying dead from skin suffocation from being completely covered in gold paint, perhaps the most iconic image in the entire series. Bond is then assigned to discover how Goldfinger transports his gold internationally and ends up in a much bigger adventure he expected, stopping him from destroying the gold in Fort Knox and ravaging the economy while increasing the value of his own gold. This is another one of the best of the Bond films with Sean Connery, it's clever, fast paced and one of the most memorable by far. Another thing about this particular movie is that actually lightens up and has its fair share of comical moments.By now, Connery has the role of Bond down flawlessly, he's the tough, resourceful, suave womanizer we all have come to know and love. One of the most defining moments is in the pre-title scene where Bond is on a mission clad in a stealth commando suit and when he is done, he quickly removes it revealing a white tuxedo, this guy is smooth. Gert Frobe is really great as Goldfinger, clever, ruthless, charismatic, and megalomaniacal. His obsession with gold shows even in how he dresses, but not so much that it becomes too gimmicky. Korean weightlifter and wrestler Harold Sakata plays Oddjob, Goldfinger's manservant and henchman with a deadly bowler hat that he throws at his victims like a discuss, usually to break their necks. He never says a word but he has a lot of personality and is always memorable, yet he never overshadows the main villain. Shirley Eaton appears pretty briefly as Jill Masterson, Goldfinger's mistress who after a brief encounter with Bond, is killed by being completely covered in gold paint, perhaps the iconic moment of the series. It's quite a shame that she gets killed off so early, she's really beautiful and has great personality, which makes her fate even more grim. Then there's Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore, and I really wish I was making that up. Pussy is the main Bond girl this time around, she is a villain when he first meet her, sarcastic, tough, and aloof toward Bond, though he tries to make her warm up to him.

It doesn't work either as an adaptation of a Chandler novel or on its own merits.I'm a big Chandler fan. I understand that adapting a book to film means making concessions, but I don't think there is a single line of dialogue from the book in this film. If you like Chandler then you know it's his dialog that makes him such an outstanding writer and more than just a pulp-fiction hack.I can also understand changing the plot, but this movie removes so much of the original and changes not only the storyline, but the characters and motivations that it becomes incoherent. I mean why make Mexican gangsters in the book into Jewish ones in the film? It takes away from the reasoning of Lennox's flight to Mexico. There is never any real understanding of why or how Lennox and Marlowe met or became friends. There are a whole group of characters left out which gave meaning to story. Without any understanding of the characters, the plot doesn't make sense, and the changes take away from the understanding and make the motivations weak.Although the story was updated to the 1970's, the look and feel is more of an early 1960's film. It wasn't avant-garde, but already outdated when it came out.Some people like the soundtrack, but I find the one song, in it's numerous variations very insipid. Hearing each version over and over again only point out how awful a song it is. It comes off as a cheap trick.So even on its own terms this movie is very weak and frustrating and as Chandler film it will make aficionados cringe.

Now it may not seem very likely that it will happen but as you can see everyone is updating on the latest computer technology and gadgets and you start to wonder when watching the movie how far will it go?The Director of the film (James Cameron) shows us a dark vision of the future with the war torn battlefields and giant robotic tanks killing humans, these scenes are not only cool to see but also truly frightening it's a place that you would not wan't to be.And the cast of the movie is well chosen the terminator is played by Arnold Schwarzenegger who is without a doubt the perfect choice for the role,as he looks very intimidating and shows no sign of emotion and you believe him in the role. Sarah Connor played by Linda Hamilton is also great in her role of a regular young woman who is unaware of the terror that is about to come her way and as time goes on she has to become strong in mind and body in order to survive, and Kyle Reese played brilliantly by Michael Biehn gives her encouragement throughout the film and plays the ultimate human protector as he is the one who knows more about the terminator than anyone else, and he has to rely on his own ingenuity to not only protect sarah but also himself. Now the special effects are very dated but there are some that still hold up to this day, the most dated special effect has to be the stop motion terminator endoskeleton in the end but then again it makes the terminator look more believable as it looks more robotic.

Comparisons with Waiting to Exhale are inevitable, but Soul Food shuns a sexist agenda that attributes its many ills to one sex at the expense of the other. Neither men nor women escape the devastating toll of the storyline. An ensemble cast of charismatic performers, an entertaining plot that alternates happy moments with tragic episodes, and Tillman's imaginative helming gives Soul Food a memorable if sometimes schmaltzy appeal.Eating Sunday dinner at Mother Joe's house constitutes an age-old family tradition for three Chicago, Illinois, based sisters, Teri (Vanessa L. Williams of Eraser), Maxine (Vivica A. Fox of Batman & Robin), and Bird (Nia Long of Friday). Mother Joe (Irma P. Hall of Mo' Money) lives to indulge her quarrelsome trio of daughters as much as her adorable grandchildren. Her favorite is Maxine's oldest son, Ahmad (Brandon Hammond of Mars Attacks). Tillman filters the poignant story of this family from the juvenile perspective of Ahmad.As Soul Food unfolds, Bird has just married Lem (Mekhi Phifer of Clockers), a guy whose criminal record has already cost him his job. As the elder sister, Teri acts as the chief financial genius of the family. She has an eye and a heart for dollars. As an affluent attorney, Teri has bankrolled her youngest sister Bird in the beauty parlor business. Teri also supervises her mother's estate and manages the family's purse strings in woebegone times. Teri never lets anybody forget her pecuniary sacrifices, especially Maxine. Teri's overwrought attitude alienates her younger sister Maxine. Rivals since high school, Maxine stole Teri's boyfriend and took him to the altar. While Teri persevered with her college education, Maxine dropped out. Her husband Kenny (Jeffrey D. Sams of Waiting to Exhale) and she started their own family. Two girls and a boy later, they have managed to survive on Kenny's blue-collar salary with no ill effects. Teri struggles to make her second marriage a success, but her greed and holier-than-thou attitude sabotage her well-intentioned efforts. Eventually, Teri's attitude jeopardizes her marriage to Miles (Michael Beach of White Man's Burden). Although Miles and she are both well-heeled attorneys, he has been bitten by the music bug. Miles wants to form a jazz band, something Teri holds in utter contempt. She argues that Miles could be earning more money at the bar&#x97;the legal bar. No matter how much these sisters bicker, they always show up for Sunday dinner at Mother Joe's house. No sooner has Tillman set up the plot than he introduces a string of predicaments that starts with Mother Joe's tragic trip to the doctor. It seems that the indestructible matriarch must have a leg removed or she will die. Reluctantly, Mother Joe consents to surgery. During the operation, she suffers a stroke and slips into a coma. The sisters maintain a vigil at Mother Joe's bedside, but their relationship continues to sour. They argue over Mother Joe's hospital bills, and the traditional Sunday dinner is the casualty of their rage. Young Ahmad doesn't understand the family fracas. He doesn't understand why Teri and Miles have drifted apart or why Lem has been arrested and jailed for brandishing a firearm in a bar. Ahmad holds his own vigil at his grandmother's beside. If Mother Joe cannot physically reunite the fragmented family, then perhaps Ahmad can. The ambitious youngster cooks up a plan that he is certain will bring the family back together for a traditional Sunday dinner. Nothing particularly original distinguishes Soul Food from a hundred or so similar family melodramas. The formulaic Tillman script plunges each character into a soup of despair. Indeed, Soul Food would rate as little more than an ethnic potboiler were it not for Tillman's nimble directing. Although the soap opera storyline alternates one sister's plight with another sister's predicament, the characters are so believably drawn and the atmosphere so filled with genuine sentiment that the film succeeds in spite of its clichés. At times, Soul Food degenerates into plain, old-fashioned mush. A subplot involving an elderly, anti-social relative named Uncle Pete (John M. Watson, Sr. of Groundhog Day) who hides in his upstairs bedroom is pretty warmed-over. Ahmad's plan to reunite a family as suspicious as each of these relatives is seems a little far-fetched, too. Although Soul Food is a movie about a family, some of its content may not be appropriate for all family members, especially juveniles. The performances are all marvelous. Each cast member plays a substantial, flesh-and-blood character with hopes and dreams. Hall steals the early scenes as Mother Joe. When one of Lem's curvaceous old flames threatens to disrupt Bird's wedding reception, Mother Joe adroitly rescues her son-in-law without stirring up discord. Mother Joe's speech about how one finger accomplished less than a knuckled-up fist is one of the movie's rousing highlights. Williams has the plum role as the materialistic sister who always gets the rough end of the stick. As her chief rival, Fox is less materialistic and more maternal. Phifer brings credible dimensions to his role as an ex-convict who faces the same song and dance from every employer who is afraid to hire him. You don't have to be African-American to appreciate Soul Food. Although the movie is aimed at mainstream black audiences, the problems that this family confronts are universal to any family. Ultimately, the sympathetic characters and the rich atmosphere of loving kindness that permeates the action compensate for the sappy story. Tillman boosts things immensely by rejecting a happily-ever-after ending, give the film a significance that it otherwise might lack. ","genre":null},{"date":"31 January 2010","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Appetizing, home-cooked Sunday dinners save a family in stress in writer & director George Tillman, Jr.'s autobiographical movie Soul Food, an emotionally satisfying but occasionally saccharine tour-de-force family melodrama. Comparisons with Waiting to Exhale are inevitable, but Soul Food shuns a sexist agenda that attributes its many ills to one sex at the expense of the other. Neither men nor women escape the devastating toll of the storyline. An ensemble cast of charismatic performers, an entertaining plot that alternates happy moments with tragic episodes, and Tillman's imaginative helming gives Soul Food a memorable if sometimes schmaltzy appeal.Eating Sunday dinner at Mother Joe's house constitutes an age-old family tradition for three Chicago, Illinois, based sisters, Teri (Vanessa L. Williams of Eraser), Maxine (Vivica A. Fox of Batman & Robin), and Bird (Nia Long of Friday). Mother Joe (Irma P. Hall of Mo' Money) lives to indulge her quarrelsome trio of daughters as much as her adorable grandchildren. Her favorite is Maxine's oldest son, Ahmad (Brandon Hammond of Mars Attacks). Tillman filters the poignant story of this family from the juvenile perspective of Ahmad.As Soul Food unfolds, Bird has just married Lem (Mekhi Phifer of Clockers), a guy whose criminal record has already cost him his job. As the elder sister, Teri acts as the chief financial genius of the family. She has an eye and a heart for dollars. As an affluent attorney, Teri has bankrolled her youngest sister Bird in the beauty parlor business. Teri also supervises her mother's estate and manages the family's purse strings in woebegone times. Teri never lets anybody forget her pecuniary sacrifices, especially Maxine.
