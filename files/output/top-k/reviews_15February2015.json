At that age, feet grow quickly. After he is asked to write a series of articles on anti-Semitism, Mr. Peck meets divorced schoolteacher Dorothy McGuire (as Kathy Lacey) at a party. They are mutually attracted. Peck is initially unhappy with his writing assignment, but becomes excited after thinking up a new angle. Peck decides to pretend he is Jewish and write about his personal experiences. I Was Jewish for Six Months is the title of Peck's account. Authentically Jewish childhood friend John Garfield (as Dave Goldman) arrives for a visit. As you might expect, Peck encounters prejudice...This famous film about religious bigotry is really a love story, although the backdrop is certainly preeminent. Incidents of anti-Semitism involve young Stockwell being teased on the playground and adult Jews finding upscale areas lack welcome mats. Today, kids are beat up and can sometimes die; around the world, people are shot at Jewish businesses. Gentleman's Agreement sticks mainly to cocktail hour inequities. Multiple award-winning director Elia Kazan and Peck take it slow. Additional award winners include supporting actress Celeste Holm (as Anne Dettrey) and juvenile actor Stockwell.

It's also one of those films that people might be familiar with, but may not have seen. And until now, I hadn't actually seen it myself. So, does it live up to its reputation? Yes, it mostly does. The story, if somebody out there doesn't know, is about Charles Foster Kane, who is taken from his parents at a young age to live with a powerful businessman and, once he comes of age, takes over control of a newspaper. Over the course of his life, which is recounted almost entirely in flashback, you see a transition from an idealistic, principled young man to a reclusive shell of his former self. I thought it was a very well-written, well-shot film that gives a very balanced portrayal of a polarizing figure. All of the performances were excellent, especially Orson Welles, who was the brainchild behind this film. I also took notice of the incredible camera-work and cinematography which made effective use of light, shadow and space as well as some really sharp camera angles which provide visual insight into power dynamics that are an integral part of the story. However the most important aspect seems to have been a man who desperately wants love and approval, but doesn't know how to get it except by trying to buy it. It is this single part of Kane that makes him a compelling character, despite being such an enigma otherwise. There was also the film's central nagging question of what his final word, rosebud, meant. I thought that the answer, which is revealed in the film's final moments, was a bit underwhelming but extremely effective as a narrative-driving device.

As when I was a child the main reason is I do not find Elwood character nor Harvey really nice maybe it is because of the menacing look of the rabbit appearing in the picture Elwood (James Stewart) hangs on the wall but Harvey has always seemed to me a manipulative and selfish creature more than a good friend trying to make Elwood life happier. And Elwood doesn't appear to me a happy character but a very sad one who, at one point of his life and due to some facts we are not allowed to know, decides (in the film it is firmly stated that it was a voluntary decision) to quit reality to live in an alternative world of his own, although he is not happy in it, only less sad. Maybe the play describes characters in a different way and show us a kind and full of bondage Elwood who only wants to live in a better, more human world with people helping each other and taking interest in other people. This is a nice and beautiful idea and I'd love the film would have shown it! but what this film shows is not this at all Elwood new world is a world where apparently everybody is kind and friendly, a world where apparently peoples' best feelings emerge to reveal better personalities. But that's what this new world is about apparency. The supposed kind and friendly people are not really so, as Elwood himself reveals when speaking to Dr. Sanderson (Charles Drake). He says he meet lots of people in the bar, friendly people but that they do not show again. And the supposed people best feelings are not seen in Elwood himself towards his own family either whilst he is more than charming to people he meets at the bar or in the mental institution, he does not have the same consideration towards his poor sister, who lives in the edge of a nervous breakdown due to his way of doing, not only by Elwood's rabbit hallucination but also having to stand with unknown people Elwood constantly invites to their home or making impossible for her to have a social life. Furthermore, allegedly absent-minded Elwood is not really so, as although he is apparently always doing what sister Veta (Josephine Hull) says he is in fact getting other people do what he (and alter ego Harvey) wants. So what is presented to us here is a man running away from his life who ends up living in a self-made rabbit cage. I don't see it is a happy comedy at all, although it has its funny moments (i.e. when Veta asks her daughter to find out who is the stranger in the bathroom after speaking with Elwood). And by quitting reality in search of a better life and a better mankind understanding he does not mind or realize hurting his own family in the process. In the end he does not seem to reach that happy status he is searching for at all, but a less painful state of mind. In fact author instruct us to just believe in Harvey's great beneficials instead of letting us to know it by first-hand by sparing us all the dialogue scene between Elwood, Harvey and Dr. Chumley (Cecil Kellaway) at the bar. Maybe Mrs. Chase didn't know how to make such chat work, but this takes off a lot of credibility to Her pretended premise. Furthermore, it is difficult to understand why Dr. Chumley runs away from Harvey once he has discovered rabbit's extraordinary beneficial power shouldn't he be happy to have Harvey around? Why else he asks Elwood to leave Harvey with him in the end? *Spoiler* And as a final punch, even in the end of the film family is not allowed to get free from Harvey (wouldn't it have been a much better ending and according to the extending bondage the play is supposed to transmitt that Harvey finally would stay with Dr. Chumley and allowed other people to enjoy him?

Upon arriving, Mr. Ireland finds corrupt local officials threatening to arrest Mr. Crawford, who draws crowds with his campaign speeches. They have Crawford's schoolteacher wife Anne Seymour (as Lucy) fired and beat up his handsome son John Derek (as Tom). Crawford's political career is a certainly a challenge. Ireland would rather be with pretty Joanne Dru (as Anne Stanton), but becomes attached to Crawford...Based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning 1946 novel by Robert Penn Warren, All the King's Men has things to say about political corruption that are still relevant, today. The story is very skillfully adapted, by director Robert Rossen. He keeps the narrative flowing briskly and elicits great performances, all around. With many scenes involving multiple characters, the director keeps everyone in place. There are times when Mr. Rossen and crew covey much with three or four players and only a few seconds of silent screen time. Obvious artistic moments strengthen scenes without being too showy; for example, children at a carnival provide chaos as Broderick experiences the aftereffects of alcohol...Sexual and romantic relationships are telegraphed by studying the faces and manners of Ms. Seymour, Ms. Dru and Mercedes McCambridge (as Sadie Burke). You could turn down the sound and gather much information by watching the faces of All the King's Women. In her first feature film appearance, Ms. McCambridge won most of the year's big Supporting Actress awards. She's marvelous, but the story should have had at least one romantic scene between McCambridge and Crawford; filmmakers may have felt the two would look unappealing together, and may have cut love scenes somewhere during the process. Crawford was clearly the year's consensus Best Actor winner...The often misplaced, but most coveted, Academy Award for Rossen was as Best Picture producer rather than director. Oscar nominated Ireland as Supporting Actor and he very likely outperformed that group, but he lost; it's just as well, Ireland is one of two leading, not supporting, performers in All the King's Men.

Crawford was clearly the year's consensus Best Actor winner...The often misplaced, but most coveted, Academy Award for Rossen was as Best Picture producer rather than director. Oscar nominated Ireland as Supporting Actor and he very likely outperformed that group, but he lost; it's just as well, Ireland is one of two leading, not supporting, performers in All the King's Men. Others in the cast to keep an eye on include doctor Shepperd Strudwick (as Adam Stanton) and devoted Walter Burke (as Sugar Boy). The film makes a strong case for incorporating an ensemble acting award. To spite the strong effort and acting impressions, the characterizations are sketchy and secondary; the main characters are politics and corruption.********* All the King's Men (11\/8\/49) Robert Rossen ~ Broderick Crawford, John Ireland, Mercedes McCambridge, Joanne Dru ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"15 February 2015","score":"","review":" This movie directed by Jerry Rees probably traumatized a lot 1980's & 1990's kids. For me, the eerie story produced by Hyperion Pictures, distributed by Disney, and based on the 1980's children's novel by Thomas M. Disch The Brave Little Toaster A Fairy-Tale For Appliances was a fun watch. It tells the story about five household appliances Toaster (Voiced by Deanna Oliver), Radio (Voiced by Jon Lovitz), Blanket (Voiced by Timothy E. Day), Lamp (Voice by Tim Stack) and Kirby the Vacuum (Voiced by Thurl Ravenscroft) on a dangerous long quest to find their owner, referred to as the Master. Disney had bought the movie rights to the novel before it was even able to get published! I noticed about the novella, was that it was generally much lighter in tone than the film. The film really is very unsettling for a kid's movie. As much, as I like it, I don't believe, really younger audience members should see it. There are disturbing things that cannot be unseen, like the firefighter clown or the poor blender getting his motor, rip out, like a person getting his organs harvest in the black market. The worst had to be, the withering death of a love-sick flower or car death camp scene. Those scenes still make me sad. The movie really tries hard to contributing a feel-good nature to the already depressing premise. Sadly, it doesn't match up that well. A good example of this is the meadow segment, with a burlesque comedy of beavers, turtles and squirrels, culminating in a grand 1930s style musical water ballet of frogs and an operatic fish. It felt out of place. For a film that has a really dumb premise, it's surprising very smarten delivered. There are tons of fan theories about this movie. You really can go into the movie hidden themes, like how the movie acts like a social commentary and critic to 1980s over-consumerism and throwaway society. The appliances could represented, the older generations like the Baby Boomers & the Greatest & Silence generation trying to find a reason to live in a Generation X, type world, where they don't matter as much. Older people can relate to those appliances, because they saw themselves, being replace in the job field, family life and others. A good example of this, is the scene with the pickup car that formerly belonged to a Hopi reservation. His driver told him to his face that he was worthless and junked him, despite his being in near perfect condition. It could represent how even the Native American became a bit too materialism in the world. Another theory is that movie is secretly really about the Holocaust and how they 'the masters' AKA Nazis dealt with the mentally challenge. People say that the appliances represent mentally ill people that had been abandoned, because people see no use with them. The toaster has extreme Claustrophobia. Lamp has aggression issues. Vacuum has OCD. Blanket has stalking issues\/extreme co dependence and Radio is bi polar. I can see, where people might get this idea. After all, characters like the Radio talks as if he's living in the 1940s and the car junkyard could represented the Nazis death camps. Other people think it's about Uncle Toms slave during the days of American slavery. Once again, I can see why people think that way. The biggest fan theory that I heard is that the movie represented how God sees suicide. Just think about it five appliances wait patiently for their Master to return AKA God\/Jesus. They are almost tricked into thinking that he has abandoned them, but they overcome this and set off to find him and the City of Light AKA Heaven, only to believe, they been replace. Their many adventures are metaphorical for the trials and tribulations of life, when they gave up on him, they went sent to the junkyard, representing hell and Satan. Then, we meet sad stories of car, telling stories about their owners giving up on them or themselves like the Texan, the Indy 500 car, and the woody wagon. It's really heavy to take. This movie is 2010's Toy Story 3 if it went to the extreme. It's a lot more mature than a lot of kid's film, even today. A lot of dark imagery, but at least, the movie ends with a happy note. The animation seems a bit dated and grainy, but it somehow acts to reinforce the notion that the appliances are out of pace with their city competitors. It's not the best. The voice acting are pretty good for the most part. The movie has a lot of great music. It's A B-Movie Show, City of Light., 'Worthless' and 'Tutti Frutti' are fun to listen to. The comedy is at a minimum, but somewhat funny. Most of the humor comes from the smartly written dialogue for the Radio. Mostly a hit, with a few misses. It should be noted that some of the people behind this film such as John Lasseter and Joe Ranft went on to work for Pixar. In fact, Lamp may be based on the same lamp used for the design of Pixar's first CGI short - which became the studio's logo. The original film was followed by two sequels. The first sequel was 1997's The Brave Little Toaster & 1998'sThe Brave Little Toaster Goes To Mars. Those sequels are not worth checking out. Can't recommended that. Overall You can never be too old for this classic, but you could be too young for this film. Not a little kid's movie. More like a PG-13 film in today standards. So, grab a plateful of buttered toast, and your cozy electric blanket for this good, but gloomy film! It's worth watching.

As Guido attempts to balance and control the female influences on his life, the film takes on a frantic pace, until he eventually realizes that he's in over his head and must surrender. It's a brilliant film about the creative process, but more importantly it's a film about human relationships. Guido is a misogynist, and the film mocks his attempt to control the women in his life, keeping them each in there own little box.

While I do feel like it is a good film, if a little unspectacular or by-the-numbers, I've never liked Winona Ryder that much. She acquits herself nicely here, but her character is rather vanilla and bland, especially compared to the colorful cast of characters she meets while institutionalized. The most interesting (and most developed) of these is Lisa, played by Angelina Jolie. While she might be better known as a movie star than as a serious actress these days, this performance came before all of that and, in my opinion, is one of her best. In fact, she gives the best performance in the entire film. In terms of thematic content, there are a lot of things said about insanity and mental health. Also, given the time period of 1967-1968, one could infer commentary on the state of America's mental institutions, especially as they applied to women. There's also some subtle commentary on the Vietnam War, although not to a great extent since that wasn't the main focus of the story. Whatever thematic goals the film may have had, however, pale in comparison to the character work and ensemble cast. As a portrait of life in a mental institution during the late 60's, I thought it was very effective, humorous and occasionally poignant. Brittany Murphy also had a small role as a character who is involved with one of the film's more serious moments. There are a couple more things that I thought about while watching this, one of them amusing and the other quite tragic. The first is a part of the film when Lisa and Susanna escape with the intention of going to Florida and getting jobs at the newly established Disney World. Lisa wants to be Cinderella, which is kind of funny considering that just last year Angelina Jolie played Maleficent for Disney. Not quite the same, but still interesting. The other, and which is a bit of a spoiler, is that Brittany Murphy would eventually meet a tragic end like her character in this film. Anyway, this wasn't some brilliant expose of mental institutions but it did function especially well as a character study. Winona Ryder's character was a bit bland, but only because she was completely upstaged by everyone around her. Recommended, but mostly for Angelina Jolie's performance.

Also, given the time period of 1967-1968, one could infer commentary on the state of America's mental institutions, especially as they applied to women. There's also some subtle commentary on the Vietnam War, although not to a great extent since that wasn't the main focus of the story. Whatever thematic goals the film may have had, however, pale in comparison to the character work and ensemble cast. As a portrait of life in a mental institution during the late 60's, I thought it was very effective, humorous and occasionally poignant. Brittany Murphy also had a small role as a character who is involved with one of the film's more serious moments. There are a couple more things that I thought about while watching this, one of them amusing and the other quite tragic. The first is a part of the film when Lisa and Susanna escape with the intention of going to Florida and getting jobs at the newly established Disney World. Lisa wants to be Cinderella, which is kind of funny considering that just last year Angelina Jolie played Maleficent for Disney. Not quite the same, but still interesting. The other, and which is a bit of a spoiler, is that Brittany Murphy would eventually meet a tragic end like her character in this film. Anyway, this wasn't some brilliant expose of mental institutions but it did function especially well as a character study. Winona Ryder's character was a bit bland, but only because she was completely upstaged by everyone around her. Recommended, but mostly for Angelina Jolie's performance.

While I do feel like it is a good film, if a little unspectacular or by-the-numbers, I've never liked Winona Ryder that much. She acquits herself nicely here, but her character is rather vanilla and bland, especially compared to the colorful cast of characters she meets while institutionalized. The most interesting (and most developed) of these is Lisa, played by Angelina Jolie.

Because of the time between the films we get the unique experience of watching two characters age, retaining the core of their personality, but taking on greater complexity as the years pass. The first film is about embracing the moment and forging a genuine human connection. The second film, Before Sunset, is about the regret of missed opportunities and the need to be true to yourself. The third film, Before Midnight, is about the consequences of actually getting what you want.

Why, one done by Stephen King himself of course! 1986's Maximum Overdrive was the first and only directing job by Stephen King. Adapted from King's short story Trucks, it presents the tale of machines of all types coming alive all of a sudden to wreck havoc on the human race and in particular, an assorted group of truckers, newlyweds, cooks, and grease monkeys at a roadside truck stop. At the same time, there's a strange, green comet in earth's atmosphere that seems to be the cause of all the chaos and if our heroes at the truck stop can hold out for just a few days until the comet passes, they may stand a chance. Problem is, can they survive everything man-made thrown at them?The film features plenty of gore, death and destruction, and some good performances for a film of this type. Starring in the lead role is Emilio Estevez as ex-con and parolee Bill Robinson in a worthy and street smarts performance, who's forced to work for shyster and all around shady truck stop owner Bubba Hendershot (Pat Hingle in an excellently done slimy performance) as per condition of his parole when the world goes to hell. Joining them is a couple on newlyweds (Played by John Short and Yeardley Smith in a comedic and kind of cute performance), a young, pretty hitchhiker with a switchblade named Brett (Laura Harrington) and a wide assortment of redneck truckers and all around zany characters. Stalking them is anything from big, semi-trucks to lawnmowers, from bulldozers to army jeeps with machine guns. Just about any machine you can imagine turns into a bloodthirsty killer. Hell, even a soda machine turns deadly! But the machine you are probably going to remember the most after the credits roll is the Happy Toys truck, a big semi with the hilarious looking face of the green goblin as its front grill! Helping set the mood to all this is a score and soundtrack by the legendary rock band ACDC, including the song Who Made Who. To be sure, Maximum Overdrive won't win any academy awards or praise from the critics anytime soon! But at the same time, I don't think the film warrants the level of criticism it's gotten either. The film is an outrageous, zany B-movie that's not meant to be taken seriously. It's the type of film you'd see on Cinemax or the old USA Network back in the day. Some parts are you can't help but laugh at (such as when the one hysteric waitress at the diner suddenly bolts out door and yells the famous line, WEEE Made YOOOUUU!), others nasty or bizarre. Either way, the film entertains. Sadly, though, the overall experience of making the film and the reaction it received has pretty much guaranteed that Stephen King will never direct another film again (King admits he was coked out of his mind while directing and based on his appearance in the trailer they made, I believe him!). Still, if you're in the mood for a ridiculous, B-movie adventure, Maximum Overdrive is one film where you can't go wrong. And last but not least, never forget the eternal question Who made who?

It was something of a sensation back in the day and with good reason. Despite having a plot-line that was seemingly very derivative of an earlier Hong Kong crime flick, it was nevertheless an extremely fresh approach that Tarantino brought to the movies. He impressively went one better with his next feature Pulp Fiction but irrespective of that, Reservoir Dogs will always be regarded as one of the great debut features. Its influence was huge and many crime flicks followed its lead and featured wise-cracking bad guys and pop cultural references. The story focuses on a group of colour-coded thieves before and after a disastrous heist. They meet up at a prearranged rendezvous point at a warehouse and accusations begin to fly. Some are convinced it was a set-up, while the waters are muddied further by one of the team acting psychotically on the job. One spends the entire film bleeding to death and whose background story forms a key part of the plot.The manner in which the film is constructed is one of its greatest strengths. The drama flashes backwards and forwards and in doing so layers are added and gradually truths emerge. In taking this approach Tarantino masterfully controls and heightens the tension. The very fact he has devised a heist movie which features everything but the heist itself, shows serious confidence. The cast is quite brilliant with Lawrence Tierney as a very convincing crime boss, Harvey Keitel as a career criminal, Tim Roth as the rookie he has to train and possibly the most central character in the film (he is good although his American accent is sometimes a bit ropey), Steve Buscemi puts in a star-making turn as a cynical but clear-headed wise-guy, Michael Madsen is authentically scary as the psychopathic member of the group, real-life ex-con Eddie Bunker has a small role but looks the part , Chris Penn is extremely naturalistic as the crime bosses son Nice Guy Eddie and Tarantino himself is actually pretty good (for once) as the unfortunate Mr Brown.But it's as a writer and director that Tarantino is best and Reservoir Dogs shows himself clearly at the top of his game. Characters often pause to discuss all manner of tangential, trivial everyday things. He uses many very long takes which in the wrong hands will slow down the pace of a movie but here only heighten the tension and bring out the drama more.

Harold Shand (Bob Hoskins) is an old school gangster trying to get the biggest piece of the pie in this new environment, and just when he is on the cusp of closing off that market is when his empire comes under significant threat from an unknown power.John Mackenzie has created a film that feels cathartic in tone and action. The themes and symbolism are all visceral and violent, even the name is taken from the day in which Jesus Christ was tortured to death. Mackenzie definitely captures a slice of a generation in destruction, but I found it difficult to empathise with it. The scene where Shand has to pay kids to clear away from his car embodies the insincerity of this outlook. Shand in two scenes previously spoke about the moral collapse of Brixton but this scene praises the moral decrepitude of the children. I could only conclude two things from these scenes; Shand had tortured or assaulted two black people in the other 2 scenes in Brixton, and these kids were all white, therefore it was just some excusable racism. Or it was a script oversight.I also found it difficult to maintain what exactly was going on. The script introduces every secondary character in a barrage of names and casual greetings at the start of the film, so when the film was concluding I had to spend 5-10 seconds remembering who was who. This was a momentarily loss of concentration when all the action was fast paced, and I was a little bit removed from all of it.Visually the film feels grimy, with some interesting camera angles to boot. One camera effect that will stick with me in terms of immersion was in the abattoir, where Mackenzie switches to a first person shot. Also the lightening creates a natural effect, and some of the more violent elements of the film feel tangible.Bob Hoskins was spectacular as well. Hoskins at the start comes across as a harmless geezer, but as the pressure builds he becomes violently and unpredictable, even menacing in some scenes. Helen Miriam as his partner, also complements his great performance, and the exchanges between the two feel genuine. The supporting cast on the other hand is a bit of a mess, the casting director picked too many people who look like each other. If I described someone in the film as the early 40-ish, tall, sunken faced, rough blonde gangster, that would fit three characters and this also added to my confusion in parts.This film feels dated and budget constricted. And I aware that this is one of these must see British films, however something's only remain relevant because of nostalgia, and this feels more like a throwback than an all time great.

Harold Shand (Bob Hoskins) is an old school gangster trying to get the biggest piece of the pie in this new environment, and just when he is on the cusp of closing off that market is when his empire comes under significant threat from an unknown power.John Mackenzie has created a film that feels cathartic in tone and action. The themes and symbolism are all visceral and violent, even the name is taken from the day in which Jesus Christ was tortured to death. Mackenzie definitely captures a slice of a generation in destruction, but I found it difficult to empathise with it. The scene where Shand has to pay kids to clear away from his car embodies the insincerity of this outlook. Shand in two scenes previously spoke about the moral collapse of Brixton but this scene praises the moral decrepitude of the children. I could only conclude two things from these scenes; Shand had tortured or assaulted two black people in the other 2 scenes in Brixton, and these kids were all white, therefore it was just some excusable racism. Or it was a script oversight.I also found it difficult to maintain what exactly was going on. The script introduces every secondary character in a barrage of names and casual greetings at the start of the film, so when the film was concluding I had to spend 5-10 seconds remembering who was who. This was a momentarily loss of concentration when all the action was fast paced, and I was a little bit removed from all of it.Visually the film feels grimy, with some interesting camera angles to boot. One camera effect that will stick with me in terms of immersion was in the abattoir, where Mackenzie switches to a first person shot. Also the lightening creates a natural effect, and some of the more violent elements of the film feel tangible.Bob Hoskins was spectacular as well. Hoskins at the start comes across as a harmless geezer, but as the pressure builds he becomes violently and unpredictable, even menacing in some scenes. Helen Miriam as his partner, also complements his great performance, and the exchanges between the two feel genuine. The supporting cast on the other hand is a bit of a mess, the casting director picked too many people who look like each other. If I described someone in the film as the early 40-ish, tall, sunken faced, rough blonde gangster, that would fit three characters and this also added to my confusion in parts.This film feels dated and budget constricted. And I aware that this is one of these must see British films, however something's only remain relevant because of nostalgia, and this feels more like a throwback than an all time great.

Its stop- motion animation entertains with a seemingly effortless ease, though quite a lot of painstaking artistry was required to bring the world of Jack Skellington to life. It's the story of Jack, the Pumpkin King, who is essentially the physical embodiment of the spirit of Halloween. After yet another successful Halloween, Jack wanders away from town with his dog Zero, tired of the holiday he has mastered and seeking a new sense of purpose. He stumbles into Christmas Town and decides to give the people of Halloween Town a new project. Though not overtly political, Nightmare has a progressive quality, both in terms of the daring vision it brings to the screen and in its themes. It's a film about struggling against the boundaries of your environment and pressing for change. And even though Jack's attempt to usurp Christmas is misguided and ultimately unsuccessful, he's not wrong to seek new possibilities, and he emerges from the experience a changed skeleton. He's revived and renewed, and with the help of Sally, who loves Jack for who he is, he realizes his ambition was driven by selfishness. In the end, he's wiser, having learned to play his own role well without descending into isolation. After setting things right, Jack is better able to listen to, collaborate with, and connect with others for the benefit of everyone.

Nowhere is that more perfect than in here. He's so likable but so unlikable and charming, it's unreal. At his absolute best in this unusual romantic comedy of self change.Phil Conners, (Bill Murray) is a grumpy weather man who travels to Punxsutawney, PA for the annual Groundhog Day, only to be stuck in a time loop, reliving groundhog day over and over again. With nothing to lose, he has as much fun with it as possible, until his attraction to his journalist, (Andie Macdowell) makes him look at his life when he falls in love with her, not being able to change himself for her.It's a different take of romantic comedy where the romance is one sided. It deals with Bill Murray coping with the situation in different ways. He tries suicide, having fun, trying to do good to the point where he's tired of acting good then becoming rotten again. It's such a well set up film with a really fun touch to it. It cleverly plays around with the repetitive nature of the scenes. It can drive some nuts, but seeing him react in different ways every day is super fun.There have been so many philosophies about the time loop in this film How long does he stay in the loop? what is the perspective of everybody else? What causes it? So many questions near the end, but it's such a clever way to display its message about self change.With that said, Bill Murray is hilarious. He is so care free and sarcastic in this film, it's unreal. He'll go with anything if it feels right. He manipulates women by learning a lot about them overtime, then sleeping with them. It's a film that can go anywhere at anytime. Watching Bill Murray's multiple reactions is just insanely hilarious. Nobody else could have pulled this off. It's simply perfect.Even though It's probably not the best comedy of all time, it's my favorite comedy. It's the perfect blend of stupid, clever, and emotional, and to be centered around one of the funniest people of all time, there's no getting around how excellent and timeless this is.

The voice acting, with such voices as John Hurt and Richard Briers, is generally above-par, although in some parts it's a bit samey, and Kehaar's voice has the potential to be very annoying at times (it's also a little weird - in his iconic line P*SS OFF! he sounds like the voice of a woman on Monty Python, however in basically all his other dialogue he sounds like someone doing a bad impersonation of Roberto Benigni), however both of these are fairly easy to overlook. The animation is really good for a lesser budgeted film of the time, particularly in the opening sequence of the story of El-ahrairah, but some of the animations are quite choppy in certain places. An annoying side effect of the very high quality of the Digibeta print from which the movie was presented was that some of the imperfections of the animation were made quite obvious (for instance there is quite a lot of static dirt in some scenes, presumably sandwiched inbetween the cels of the characters and background). For such a modest film, it has quite a grand and bombastic orchestral score, which is very well composed and played, making those final scenes even more effective, and it also has an oddly haunting song in Art Garfunkel's ballad Bright Eyes playing over what is arguably the most emotional scene in the movie, and making it only more so. For the most part, this is a generally light- hearted little movie, however the last 15 or so minutes are genuinely rather dramatic, quite shocking (seriously, how the f**k did this get a U?), and undeniably tense.
