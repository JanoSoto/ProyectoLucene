In other words, they treated a lighthearted, not-to-be-taken-seriously project as if it were brooding and provocative like the first two movies, most notably James Whale's masterwork Bride of Frankenstein. As a result, The Ghost of Frankenstein was a little slow-going for me. However, the following picture in the franchise (or at least on my DVD collection) House of Frankenstein was a step down in quality, but up in entertainment. Because this movie recognizes that it is low-key and packed full of kitsch, and makes the best of it. That's the secret to its charm and I would be a hypocrite if I told you I did not enjoy watching it.The movie clocks at a brisk seventy-one minutes and every frame of it stirs up nostalgia and a sense of fun. The movie is called House of Frankenstein really because it combines several iconic characters. Boris Karloff stars not as the green-skinned monster, but a mad scientist (not Dr. Frankenstein) seeking out revenge on those who threw him behind bars. To exact his revenge, he calls upon the Frankenstein monster (played by Glenn Strange), Count Dracula (John Carradine), the Wolf Man (Lon Chaney Jr.), and a hunchback (J. Carrol Naish). Along the way, they pick up a cabaret dancer (Anne Gwynne) who catches the eye of the hunchback, but loves the Wolf-Man whenever he's not howling at the moon.Sure, it's silly and the movie has no real purpose for any of the creatures. Heck, Count Dracula's scenes could have been entirely excised from the picture and nobody would have known the difference. The Frankenstein monster exists for no other reason than to be there for the climax. The only creature that has any real sense of belonging is the Wolf-Man. It's a real treat that Lon Chaney Jr. reprised his immortalizing role here. But everybody else seems just obligatory to be in the picture. This movie is a dartboard for critics, but this one had a great time and has no regrets in saying so.Every now and then this picky, pro-and-con-measuring reviewer is in the mood for a big, fast-moving hunk of cheese wrapped in a big ball and House of Frankenstein delivers. It knows precisely what it is doing, it has an eye-candy cast, lots of hammy dialogue that is delivered with deliberate pretentiousness, and it never dulls out. Sure, it's dimwitted, but it's a lot of fun.

This movie centers around what looks to be a new suburban area ( so new 1\/2 the houses are partially constructed). The hero here is a young boy and his sister. The characters are OK and make no mistake this film in no way approaches the original. However I did like the introduction of electricity as a means of destroying the living dead. It has a certain sci-fi plausibility to it. Electricity essentially fry's the cadavers reanimated cns as well as every other nerve system as well in effect finally eliminating the zombie. Electrical current would also have the effect of dehydrating the reanimated tissue-so like I said sci-fi plausibility. This film is better than average and worth a look if you liked the 1st one.

I found the film interesting, well paced and very emotional towards the end. The direction was pretty good as well. I specially enjoyed the way Abra and Cal's relationship was developed and handled. As in most old films, some things are a bit hard to relate but the core themes are very much timeless.Raymond Massey and Julie Harris who played Abra and Adam Trask respectively, were both great but, the film belongs to James Dean. He was exceptional in the role of Cal and stole the show. He had a lot of charisma and good presence. It's worth noting that his role is very similar to the role he played in Rebel Without a Cause which leads me to think that he has an affinity with that kind of persona, the young angry outcast.Overall, it's a very nice watch with a stellar performance by the icon, James Dean.7.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"7 October 2010","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" In the Salinas Valley, in and around World War I, Cal Trask feels he must compete against overwhelming odds with his brother Aron for the love of their father Adam.
