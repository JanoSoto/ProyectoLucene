She doesn't even LOOK at Odin in the movie, it makes the audience feel like their relationship is purely physical.

Even if this isn't to your taste (and if not, shame on you), this has to be a perfect film. It's original and imitative, it's prosaic and profound. It moves with fluidity and visual splendor (odd to find myself preferring that word here). The main characters are so lonely and pathetic, and so deeply human and sad, you recognize yourself in them--your future self, at least.And it is a movie about love and death, about growing old enough to not know if you can be loved, and if you are loved, not knowing why. Both ways. This touches a chord for me. It comes at the end of my favorite decade for movies, the 1940s (which begins with 1939, expansively), and it comes as a pinnacle of film noir, though an odd example. It kills the main character in the opening scene and has him giving the voice-over anyway. Pretending to resuscitate an old silent screen star, played by Gloria Swanson, it actually resuscitates Gloria Swanson herself. It brings Cecil B. DeMille back to the screen, back actually on the screen, in a poignant and slightly ironic role (he plays the part of filmmaker with businesslike kindness, his sweetness genuine but also practical). And Erich von Stroheim, ever gloomy and disgruntled, but omniscient, too, the only one who seems to understand exactly why this is happening, and think it all for the best.If you are not (yet) an old film buff and have heard of none of these people from earlier eras, you can watch it as a richly filmed crime\/noir\/screenwriter movie (all three) with enough twists and interior monologues to satisfy even the most bored and jaded viewer. If we get past all the pre-post-modern references and homages built into the cast and plot, we can see something about Joe Gillis, a failing screenwriter played by William Holden, lost in the world, thinking he has morality and talent and even some good looks, but somewhere things have gone wrong. All he has to do is right himself, but the boat is stubborn, and only the illusion of redemption lures him out, and he begins to write even though he knows it's futile, and we know it's futile. We know in the beginning he dies in the end. Work, and working, whatever the milieu, is just that exercise some of us go through to make it to tomorrow alive, filling the days, persuading others that we're fine, that life has meaning. Such people (I'm not sure if I'm one of them) even fool themselves, because a life like that might have no meaning other than itself--the present moment, the doing as it is being done, and when it seems that the work will bear fruit--that Gillis's script has possibility--all becomes false and temporary.In this poem the heroine is unlikely and outwardly insufficient, and because of that she is perfect and more than enough--Nancy Olson, that person we really are out here in reality land, the one who is on the fringes of hope but who is, actually, happy inside. Or at least knows how to be happy--partly by dreaming, partly by taking chances, and mostly by being grounded and honest with yourself.Another aspect to watch is the insider look at movie-making. A few films swing you behind the scenes, behind the camera, and this does it during that big picture, factory feel of the studios, and though brief, it's a thrill. The fact that Norma Desmond (the Swanson character) is out of touch with it all is sad, of course, but isn't that also what life is all about, the passing of one thing and the rising of another?Who would have thought such a fantastical mind blower as this would be about the nitty gritty depths of reality?

Clint Eastwood's character William Bill Munny is a killer\/ alcoholic cured of his sins by his deceased wife. His old partner in crime and recently re-united Ned Logan is played by Morgan Freeman.The film begins when a young new hotshot shows up at Bill's farm with a proposition. Hearing of Munny's reputation as the worst gunslinger of them all, The Schofield Kid, played by Jaimz Woolvett, asks Munny for his help in a well paid job to kill two men. The men the Kid was hired to kill, cut up a hooker in another town. Munny at first says no, even when the Kid agrees to split the money with Munny. However, soon Munny is on his way to catch up with the Schofield Kid and even stops along the way to pick up his old partner in crime.While this movie is conventional in its plot, setting, and every other way, it's ending is everything but conventional. The ending of Unforgiven is not a typical ending where everyone is happy in the end, and all is perfect. I really liked the fact that this movie took a chance and didn't go for the predictable happy ending.Though the ending wasn't the usual conclusion to a film and took a risk, it also left the viewer unsatisfied. It wasn't really much of an ending at all. One minute guns are blazing, shots are firing and the next nothing. I really think that a better ending could have been written, conventional or not. Another thing that really bothered me the entire movie, the hooker whose face got cut up so badly wasn't even cut up that badly. The movie was made in 1992; they absolutely could have done a better job on making her wounds look worse.Unforgiven definitely had an all-star cast with actors like Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman. However I don't think that the roles that the actors were in were interesting or showed any talent whatsoever. Bill Munny, Clint Eastwood's character doesn't speak much of the movie and has the same snarling ho-hum demeanor the entire film.

Finding love in the times of moral depravation is a constant theme and it is fairly established that Billy has had a tormented childhood. He has grown up to become a very sentimental and emotional person in spite of his parents being uninterested and disconnected up to the point that the family seems severely dysfunctional. Contributing much to the introvert and overtly acidic nature of Billy. It is quite understandable. As to why Layla(Ricci) seems so jaded and emotionally unaffected, is not explained but it could be due to her bleak and isolated environment. The way she never tries to run away or raise an alarm when she has a chance, even though she is being abducted makes me feel that she somewhat needed to be rescued herself from the boring life she was in. In a way she wanted it to happen or she just started enjoying it. The Camera work is just brilliant, the perspective angles of view while Billy, his parents and Layla are having lunch is something I would forever remember. The memories and flashback are something that makes this movie go forward but in a very distinctive way. A benevolent but pushed down friend(Goon) and that he is always sleeping in his briefs whenever Billy calls him, Houston's performance of Billy's football fanatic mom and his foolish desperate act that landed him in jail at the first place are all hilarious and seem commonplace enough to be convincing. The heart shaped cookie and hot chocolate scene makes the movie almost cute. Ricci is one of my favourite actresses and she is one of those rare actors who can tell it all through their eyes. The movie never fails to satisfy my imagination. At the end the sudden reversal of Billy is just coming of age. There may be a few proponents of an alternate ending where Billy kills wood and himself out of years old hatred. That would have made the movie shocking but it would have had no hope. So the ending couldn't have been better. Vincent Gallo's performance is amazingly erratic and a good study for theatrical purposes. It's all about a man struggling to stay sane in an insane world.

Bill hires an Indian warlord called Chief Sitting Bull to guest star in his show, but to Bill's annoyance Sitting Bull proves to be a decent and honourable old man rather than a murderous savage.Bill attempts to get Sitting Bull to re-enact various battles between cowboys and Indians, but Sitting Bull refuses to be portrayed as a caricature. Rather than act out Custer's Last Stand as a cowardly sneak attack initiated by red skins, Sitting Bull instead requests to portray the massacre of a peaceful Sioux community by marauding US Cavalry soldiers. What follows is a battle of myths. Sitting Bull wants to portray his people as the victims of genocide, whilst Bill hopes to portray himself (and by extension the history of White American settlers) as a noble hero and the natives as brutal savages in need of either expulsion or civilization. Bill's history is wrong, of course, but he is the victor as he owns the show, controls the money and knows exactly what his white audience wants. His myth gets printed.And so these various themes &#x96; politics, show-business, the commodification of history, the blurring of fact and myth &#x96; play out in typical Altman fashion. And like most of Altman's films, this is a giant ensemble piece which takes place in a self-contained environment (the ropey confines of a Wild West Show). Elsewhere Altman's camera glides through his landscape, floating from character to character, various narrative strands gently picked up and followed. It's a graceful sort of film-making, Altman less concerned about delivering spectacle, than gently exposing the conditions under which such spectacle thrives. On the most basic level Altman deconstructs Old West iconography, presenting the cowboy as a show-biz creation who is himself duped by the very myths he bolsters. Altman's Buffalo Bill wears a wig, can't shoot straight, can't ride a horse and requires all his mock battles to be rigged in his favour, and yet he's constantly proclaiming himself to be a grand hero and seasoned man of the west. The film's great joke is that we the audience are so seduced by Paul Newman's star persona, his charisma, the way he commands his on screen lackeys, that we don't quite notice how much of a bumbling idiot he is. The film's characters go out of their way to illustrate this mightily confused blurring of reality and illusion. Altman makes us aware that his film is populated by mere actors and implies that both the personal and show business personae of Buffalo Bill are equally fraudulent. As such, Bill is constantly looking at reflections or portraits of himself, his personality always distorted. Altman also exposes the symbiotic relationship between show business and politics. Upon seeing President Cleveland, Bill exclaims There's a star! and of Sitting Bull he says, If he wasn't interested in show business he wouldn't be a chief! Later it is revealed that President Cleveland consults an aid before speaking and that Bill has someone else write all his material, both men the unwilling orators of a national myth. Altman then implicates both the audience and the public in the writing of both history and show business. Truth is that which gets the most applause, one character correctly remarks. The show that is most seen, most palatable, most digested by the masses, is the show that is embraced as historical fact. Nations are built on noble lies, Altman says, and art exists to either propagate or challenge these national myths. This is made most direct when, in the film's final scene, Bill studies a portrait of himself on a white stallion. Is he sitting on that horse right? Bill asks, then turns to the camera. If he's not sitting on that horse right, how come you all took him for a king? Altman's point is clear. The facts, the cinematic clues, that Buffalo Bill was a fraud were always there. We just chose not to look. The implication is that seeing is always a matter of choice, perception a function of the needs of a dominant ideology. Altman is challenging the audience to see the flaws, to see our history and our present as it really is. And so Altman demonstrates that history itself is increasingly becoming another commodity of capitalist economy; history then is not a Truth, but a matter of choice, able to be traded, bought and sold. The resulting alienation from its process of creation and from the interconnection of its events leads to a loss of truth which only performance can replace. Tellingly the film ends with a photograph - a staged event of a staged event - the audience asked to recall an earlier scene in which this shot was composed. Without this prior context, anyone stumbling upon the photograph would assume that a tall and muscular Indian, carefully positioned by Buffalo Bill to draw attention away from the old and timid looking Sitting Bull, is the real deal. It is this loss of context, of objectivity, that Altman is ultimately condemning. History is like a photograph, deliberately composed, and so without context values may be constantly reformulated according to the narrow requirements of the dominant ideology. Compare this to the end of Brian De Palma's Redacted, in which a soldier's smile is recorded as truth, when in fact it is forced, a lie and masking something far darker. Altman's film amounts to the same thing, though his photograph is then sold and paraded about as political currency.8.9\/10 &#x96; Masterpiece. See Hany Abu-Assad's Paradise Now.

I must say great movie one of the best I've saw! Clearly it's special because this was Clint Eastwood's first directorial debut, yet still this film was significant for the fact that it was really the first to introduce the stalker and love obsession genre as it was not 1987's Fatal Attraction but 1971's Play Misty for Me that started the genre.The film is well written as director Eastwood stars as Dave Garver a coastal California man who earns a living working as a late night radio DJ. And as Dave host the show when he's not talking or playing jazz music he's constantly getting calls from a female voice who always request the song Play Misty for Me to be played over the air. Then one night it turns out oddly enough when Dave goes to a local bar for a drink he meets an eager sexy woman and it turns out this woman has been the voice of the late night request! This woman Evelyn Draper(Jessica Walter who plays the role to a very wicked form)then arranges a passionate and hot one night stand with Dave. And this is exactly what Dave thought it was just a one night stand, yet Evelyn pushes for a torrid affair only Dave wises up and sees that she's to obsessed and he ends it.Then to add more drama Dave's ex flame Tobie(played by sexy and attractive future soap star Donna Mills)has returned back to the West Coast, and gradually the two rekindle their old love making ways. Still lurking around the shadows of the California forest, and oceanside is miss Evelyn herself as Evelyn soon will take her lust to a dangerous game of violence. As soon Dave and everything and everyone around him become the target of this very dangerous cat and mouse game.Clearly this was one of the best films ever made not only just for introducing the stalker and love obsession genre, but for it's direction from Clint as his pacing and shooting of the film really foreshadowed the viewer to be in a lot of suspense. And the California scenery was pretty as this picture was shot in Clint's hometown of Carmel, California.

I must say great movie one of the best I've saw! Clearly it's special because this was Clint Eastwood's first directorial debut, yet still this film was significant for the fact that it was really the first to introduce the stalker and love obsession genre as it was not 1987's Fatal Attraction but 1971's Play Misty for Me that started the genre.The film is well written as director Eastwood stars as Dave Garver a coastal California man who earns a living working as a late night radio DJ. And as Dave host the show when he's not talking or playing jazz music he's constantly getting calls from a female voice who always request the song Play Misty for Me to be played over the air.

Dystopian cities, filled with drug-addicts and gun-nuts, a broken police force with no want to stop crime, and an enormous sociopath robot with a gigantic machine gun and seemingly infinitive ammunition. The Beginning of the film starts in the fashion of the genre, with a news broadcast stating the most threatening element in Detroit city at that time, Nuke. The most addictive narcotic known to man. The police are still on strike, all except robocop and his partner lewis. Robo's entrance is top notch, a film scene which should be considered a classic. When i first seen his foot slamming on the ground i felt like cheering. The scenes to follow, however, did seem disappointing to me. Murphy-at the end of the first film- had lost the robotic overtone to his voice, the character has regressed though, and this has returned stronger than ever. in the scene where robo talks with his wife, you'll think that robo is being heartless and cold, but when you see the scene after where he watches her getting into her car, you see the disappointment on his face. Peter Weller is fantastic as usual, and this is a little gem of a scene. The rest of the film consists of three things Bad language, humour and violence. The soundtrack was not as good as its predecessors. It sounded more like the tune to a TV show than a Hollywood movie. Irvin Kershner, the director of the empire strikes back, was given a very short time to make this film, a few weeks. I think he did a superb job considering. This film will always be slammed for its over the top violence, especially the scene where Hob dies holding Robo's hand.

Unforgiven supports a nice story that is garnished with a little bit of everything that represents the real west, where the problems were solved at a gunpoint. There was not only violence in the film. There are also touching scenes that show regrets, compassion, loyalty and a great sense of friendship.William Munny, performed by Clint Eastwood, is a pig farmer struggling to bring up his children after the death of his beloved wife, the person that saved him from alcohol, and from being a murderer and a thief in the past. But, when The Scofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett) showed up one day and offered Munny half of the money that a group of prostitutes from the Big Whisky town were offering as a reward for the capture of a cowboy who cut up one of their member's face, he got tempted to go back to his old days. In despite of the promises made to his deceased wife, Munny decided to go after the criminal and the money, but first, he went to see his old friend Ned and asked him to be his partner like in the old times, when they went through a lot of things together. Ned (Morgan Freeman) did not say no; so the three of them rode their horses with their guns and rifles to do justice and to bring the money back home.Meanwhile, the sheriff of the Big Whisky town, Little Bill (Gene Hackman) was using the most brutal methods to maintain the order and to preserve the law. He wanted his town free of gunmen and he hated reward chasers. He was totally against the reward that the prostitutes were offering, but he let the criminal go unpunished, and the girls were thirsty of revenge. When Little Bill heard about Munny coming to town after the cowboy, he got determined to put end to his life and to the legend around his name. Is there where the action of the movie starts. Is there where guns go crazy and blood runs everywhere in Big Whisky.The film is fantastic because it grips the audience attention since the very beginning. However, is not until the final twenty minutes when the real action takes place. It is definitely a portrayal of the real western, where the meaning of the word honor is unknown, and where taking people's life is made with ease and without hesitations. There were a couple of scenes in the film that I liked the most. The chat that Munny had with the prostitute whose face was cut up, was very touching. He kind of demonstrated compassion for her, and I admired the way he refused to accept any sexual favor from her because he was still respecting the memory of his deceased wife. I also enjoyed the scenes where The Scofield Kid wanted to impress Munny and Ned claiming that he had killed five men; but when he actually made use of his gun to kill a man, his nerves broke down and he told them his truth he had never killed anybody. The cast in Unforgiven could not have been stronger. The direction and performance of Clint East Eastwood, in my opinion is outstanding. Morgan Freeman, one of my favorite actors, once again did an amazing job. Gene Hackman, whose brutality I hated, did it great as a supporting actor. The movie is a success in its totality. It has a strong cast, awesome pictures, effects and sound. It is a worth seeing film definitely a clear picture of the real west. I would give the film a rate of ten out of ten.

The film went through two directors, many troubling cast decisions, and other grueling filming procedures, however, the final result is by all means pleasing. Spartacus was the first great film for acclaimed filmmaker Stanley Kubrick who would later go on to direct films such as 2001 A Space Odyssey (1968) and A Clockwork Orange (1971) and while his slavery gem does not par with epics such as Lawrence of Arabia (1962) and The Ten Commandments (1956) it is a very interesting motion picture that while dated, seems somehow more effective and mature than its modern day mimickers.Kirk Douglas stars in the title role as Spartacus a Thracian slave who revolted against the tyrannical Roman Empire during its greatest years. Not much is known about the real Spartacus, but Douglas's portrayal, which very well might have been an influence for Mel Gibson's William Wallace in Braveheart (1994) and Russell Crowe's Maximus in Gladiator (2000), as a freedom-hungry but bloodthirsty nationalist is certainly the model for what many like to base their ideal heroes from. Opposing Spartacus is the vicious Marcus Crassus (Laurence Olivier) of Rome, whose goal ultimately becomes not to destroy Spartacus, but to destroy the name and goals of Spartacus.At a length of more than three hours, Spartacus is a tad too long, but there's not a single uninteresting moment throughout its running time. Perhaps it has too much for its own good and MAYBE some of the cuts from the past releases were necessary or did it some good, but ultimately there is no better way to see a film than the way its creator intended for it. It is held up by a very strong cast, especially by a performance by Peter Ustinov as a conniving, opportunistic slave trader. A common error of many historical epics are strong supporting characters and weak leading characters. But here, Spartacus does not fault. I was very intrigued by the performance by Kirk Douglas and saw him as a fleshed-out human being and since so little is known about the man he's portraying, there's no room for complaints on accuracy. Laurence Olivier, too, was very compelling as the tyrannical Crassus who taunts and torments with more than just his armies and his declarations for destroying the slave revolts.Stanley Kubrick was only thirty-one years old when he directed Spartacus after the first director was removed from the production and already one can see the early stages of his visions for spectacle and emotion. But in this case, the most interesting thing about Kubrick's film is the latter. While the glorious battle scenes in the film are by all means riveting, I was more compelled and interested in the genuine human stories that went on between the slaughters, especially with the romance between Douglas and Simmons, which never overstays its welcome and has an effective, pleasant atmosphere surrounding it. Alex North's Academy Award-nominated music score really finds the right note and volume for these surprisingly tender and poignant moments.

The film went through two directors, many troubling cast decisions, and other grueling filming procedures, however, the final result is by all means pleasing. Spartacus was the first great film for acclaimed filmmaker Stanley Kubrick who would later go on to direct films such as 2001 A Space Odyssey (1968) and A Clockwork Orange (1971) and while his slavery gem does not par with epics such as Lawrence of Arabia (1962) and The Ten Commandments (1956) it is a very interesting motion picture that while dated, seems somehow more effective and mature than its modern day mimickers.Kirk Douglas stars in the title role as Spartacus a Thracian slave who revolted against the tyrannical Roman Empire during its greatest years. Not much is known about the real Spartacus, but Douglas's portrayal, which very well might have been an influence for Mel Gibson's William Wallace in Braveheart (1994) and Russell Crowe's Maximus in Gladiator (2000), as a freedom-hungry but bloodthirsty nationalist is certainly the model for what many like to base their ideal heroes from. Opposing Spartacus is the vicious Marcus Crassus (Laurence Olivier) of Rome, whose goal ultimately becomes not to destroy Spartacus, but to destroy the name and goals of Spartacus.At a length of more than three hours, Spartacus is a tad too long, but there's not a single uninteresting moment throughout its running time. Perhaps it has too much for its own good and MAYBE some of the cuts from the past releases were necessary or did it some good, but ultimately there is no better way to see a film than the way its creator intended for it. It is held up by a very strong cast, especially by a performance by Peter Ustinov as a conniving, opportunistic slave trader. A common error of many historical epics are strong supporting characters and weak leading characters. But here, Spartacus does not fault. I was very intrigued by the performance by Kirk Douglas and saw him as a fleshed-out human being and since so little is known about the man he's portraying, there's no room for complaints on accuracy. Laurence Olivier, too, was very compelling as the tyrannical Crassus who taunts and torments with more than just his armies and his declarations for destroying the slave revolts.Stanley Kubrick was only thirty-one years old when he directed Spartacus after the first director was removed from the production and already one can see the early stages of his visions for spectacle and emotion. But in this case, the most interesting thing about Kubrick's film is the latter. While the glorious battle scenes in the film are by all means riveting, I was more compelled and interested in the genuine human stories that went on between the slaughters, especially with the romance between Douglas and Simmons, which never overstays its welcome and has an effective, pleasant atmosphere surrounding it. Alex North's Academy Award-nominated music score really finds the right note and volume for these surprisingly tender and poignant moments.

Filled with great animation, story, characters, and music written by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman (who sadly died of Aids before the film's release) Beauty and the Beast is an animated feature that'll go on forever and ever. I'm glad it's the only animated feature to win an award for Best Picture because I think it really deserved that and I think Walt Disney himself would of been very proud to know of that award. 10 out of 10.

It's always young and magical. I love the characters, animation, music, and story. In the story a Prince gets transformed into a Beast for being selfish towards an enchantress disguised as an old woman. He later falls in love with a girl named Belle who he takes prisoner. His whole household who have also turned into objects from the enchantress also like her hoping that she falls in love with the Beast to break the spell and be human again. My favorite scene in the movie is towards the end when Lumiere (Jerry Orbach) and Cogsworth (David Ogden Siters)argue over who told who that Belle was gonna break the spell. That was funney.

Over the course of a work day, they deal with many different bizarre customers and strange situations before finally getting to close up for the night.The movie was shot on a very low budget in black and white, with almost documentary-style filming and amateur actors. Everyone does justice to their characters, but none of the acting rises above mediocre and at times it's obvious that these are only people reciting lines. The camera work is decent, though, and the style helps the acting feel more natural.Even though the quality of the shooting and acting makes it seem like amateur hour-and-a-half, the writing is very good. The dialogue is clever and hilarious, making Dante and Randal seem like real, likable people. They'll discuss things like the deaths of the roofers working on the Death Star in Return of the Jedi and then deal with laugh-out-loud situations like staging a hockey game on the roofs of the stores. Even though most of Clerks is just watching people talk, it's actually interesting and manages to keep up a constant string of laughs.Where it does falter is during Dante's girl troubles, which feel like feeble attempts at drama and, as a result, are boring to sit through and devoid of humor. It should be mentioned, too, that Clerks was nearly rated NC-17 for its highly profane language. Anyone easily offended should stay away. The low budget may be off-putting, also, but none of this makes it any less than one of the funniest comedies out there.
