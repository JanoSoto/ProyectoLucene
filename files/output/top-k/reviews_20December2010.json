Nothing compares to it. Even in my childhood 'Pinocchio' was already one of my favorite Disney animated movies, if not my favorite. So many years later and time hasn't done anything to harm its magic and charm.Nowadays I don't call just any Disney animated film a masterpiece anymore, so I'm very selective on that matter. But 'Pinocchio' deserves to be called something that honorable.What is it that makes 'Pinocchio' so special? It is based on a Carlo Collodi's tale which isn't even all that great! I think the secret is that they made marvels with this movie. The movie is wonderful, magical, charming and a timeless classic. It is one of those movies made with heart, soul and exceptional talent. I'd go as far as telling they made it in a unique moment of inspiration.There are films that age quickly or were already born obsolete. Others take time to age. But this one never seems to age, which is amazing for something that is now 70 years old! How can that be? Well, it is so advanced for its time that it still looks fresh even for today's standards. I wouldn't guess this is so old if I didn't know already.This is a very complete movie. The artwork is perfect and colorful, everything is carefully drawn and painted. The film is a clever combination of some of the funniest moments in cinema history and some of the darkest and most sinister ever. Animation is terrific. The soundtrack is excellent, with lots of musical pieces to enjoy.This is an Italian tale, so it takes place in Italy, which is great, for it benefits from a certain Italian touch of film-making and Italian charm.The characters are another strength. Geppetto is like a funnier version of Doc from 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'. Figaro and Cleo are sweet pets. Pinocchio is far more innocent and much nicer and likable than in the book, being also a cute puppet unlike that of the book. Jiminy Cricket is a cool chap and amusing but at times he seems to have some anger issues and apparent short temper. Stromboli is hilarious and one of the most surly guys I've ever known in a movie. You wouldn't want to be around him when he gets mad! Still, I like Stromboli.I also like Honest John and Gideon. Both are hilarious. Gideon is like a wilder version of Dopey from 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'. I wonder if the myth of the foxes being clever, sly and unreliable started with Honest John. Don't let his name fool you, he is only honest by name. Well, it's not even his real name! As for Monstro the whale, I've never seen quite anything like that before or after. It still impresses in appearance, size, presence, scariness and noise!Title in Portugal 'Pinóquio'.

Radio Days is one of those films. It is unique and fun and has Woody Allen written all over it. The film is a nostalgic look at the golden age of radio during Allen's childhood as he reflects on the impact it had on his young life. The whole story is told in anecdotal form. There is a wide collection of stories, all related to radio broadcasts of the time as well as the great music that the time period spawned. The movie is short but is still a very good watch that provides a very unique and entertaining experience.As with most Woody Allen films, Radio Days is a one of a kind experience because of the way the story is told. Allen is a master at substituting conventional storytelling methods with his own unique storytelling flair. And he is able to do this without seeming pretentious or self important at all. He simply knows how to creative a narrative in any style he chooses. He keeps the story very interesting with his colorful cast of characters and the interesting things they go through. The film uniquely combines stories of fictional radio stars and fictional characters (which are obviously based heavily on Woody Allen's actual family) with actual stories of the time period. Obviously the film focuses a lot on World War II because it is set in the 40s. The time period, however, is solely established through the radio broadcasts our characters listen to. These actual broadcasts are used in certain places for humor and other places for somber dramatic effect. The film did a great job at combining funny with serious in all the appropriate places. There were moments when I would laugh out loud, as well as moments that sent a chill through my spine. It is a fascinating watch.Staying true to the Woody Allen experience, the dialouge in Radio Days is great. It is fast and chaotic, but also sophisticated and mature. The whole cast is very talkative and this is played up excellently. There are plenty of great characters with some wonderfully witty lines that put a smile on your face. The characters are all very different and very quirky. There are a lot of memorable people in this movie and some hilarious performances.This movie is a lot of fun, but it also has a clear motive. That motive is to respect the radio era and make sure that it is never forgotten. Allen clearly defines is it as an extremely important and culturally significant piece of technology in the time period. Allen plays up his jokes a great deal and the movie is very entertaining, but its main goal is to show that radio is something that should never be forgotten in the long history of technical innovations. All of Woody Allen's films have some sort of personal significance to him, but Radio Days displays a different kind of personal connection. Instead of being a film which reflects on Allen's relationship and his adult life, it takes us back to his childhood and reflects on the things that affected him there.

So I had to watch it again to get the full effect before the newer one was released. I have a lot of things against this film though as a movie. The concept for its time was amazing. I will give it that. But the filming was a bit off. The cast was half and half. Jeff Bridges was great. He basically made the movie. Bruce Boxleitner who is Allen and Tron did a decent job. As Allen he didn't seem to fit well, but did fit as Tron. Cindy Morgan was the love interest of both Bridges character and Boxleitner. She was not a very good actress. It was like her emotion was shut off. David Warner was a excellent bad guy. Even though Master Control was pretty much the main bad guy, Warner was a close second. Like I said, the concept was great. It really had something going for it. The Grid world was excellent and how most of the small characters were named after computer terms was clever. An example would be Dan Shor's character named RAM. The film on the grid was shot combination rotoscope and hand drawn. This gave the film more of a fantasy feel when you were in the Grid. The use of colors in the film were vibrant and interesting to keep the viewers attention. Now they needed this since some of the scenes were just really boring; making you wait for the more interesting parts. The music was orchestrated, but at sound parts sounded like a Sunday afternoon made for TV movie; which didn't fit with the epic feel of the film. The only other problem was the ending of the film.

Its not a pure horror movie because the plot is not simplistic enough. As a viewer you really doesn't know what it is that haunts Jacob. No defined threat appears. I guess its fair to place the movie in the space between the horror and thriller genres.The strengths of this movie are many. The story deals with the journey between life and death of a Vietnam casualty. As the story progress you understand that there must have been some government testing of psychotropic drugs involved and Jacob start to search for other veterans in his old battalion. Frightened and alone he want answers and to share experiences.As a film-maker building the story round a complex chronological time-frame always comes with a certain risk. Will the audience remain concentrated and keep interest for 90 minutes? The magic is not to overdo it and Mr Lyne uses the chronological jumps masterfully to create a sense of floating uncertainty in the story that blends very well with Jakob's haunted persona. Unabel to come to rest due to his escalating nightmarish experiences.Something could and should also be said about the special effects. No CGI in this one. And there are some scenes in the film that benefits hugely from this. In particular the hospital scene when Jacob passes through the corridor to hell lying in a hospital bed. The flesh and the individuals with foreshortened limbs that lines up on him are there for real creating a horrifying and disturbing impression. The dance-floor scene filmed in stroboscopic light when Jezzie appears to have sex with something that looks like a demon were made using life-size models and shot in real time.Some think Tim Robbins finest moment were in Shawshank redemption and maybe it was but i certainly can't think of a better choice to put Jacob Singer alive. Mr Lyne wanted Robbins boyish innocence, and innate joy in existence to play against the darkness of the character's gradual unraveling. And it works tremendously well. Elisabeth Pena as Jezzie is also convincing and Danny Aiello shines, as so often, in his minor part.The ending is superb and adds greatly to the overall impression. It puts an end to Jacobs misery and gives the answers the viewers have been waiting for. But the film also raises questions, some of which lives long after the after texts ends. Universal questions about our existence and what happens at the end.This is one of my all time favorites. Intelligent, philosophical and grand. Bravo Mr Lyne.

The story deals with the journey between life and death of a Vietnam casualty. As the story progress you understand that there must have been some government testing of psychotropic drugs involved and Jacob start to search for other veterans in his old battalion. Frightened and alone he want answers and to share experiences.As a film-maker building the story round a complex chronological time-frame always comes with a certain risk. Will the audience remain concentrated and keep interest for 90 minutes? The magic is not to overdo it and Mr Lyne uses the chronological jumps masterfully to create a sense of floating uncertainty in the story that blends very well with Jakob's haunted persona. Unabel to come to rest due to his escalating nightmarish experiences.Something could and should also be said about the special effects. No CGI in this one. And there are some scenes in the film that benefits hugely from this. In particular the hospital scene when Jacob passes through the corridor to hell lying in a hospital bed. The flesh and the individuals with foreshortened limbs that lines up on him are there for real creating a horrifying and disturbing impression. The dance-floor scene filmed in stroboscopic light when Jezzie appears to have sex with something that looks like a demon were made using life-size models and shot in real time.Some think Tim Robbins finest moment were in Shawshank redemption and maybe it was but i certainly can't think of a better choice to put Jacob Singer alive. Mr Lyne wanted Robbins boyish innocence, and innate joy in existence to play against the darkness of the character's gradual unraveling. And it works tremendously well. Elisabeth Pena as Jezzie is also convincing and Danny Aiello shines, as so often, in his minor part.The ending is superb and adds greatly to the overall impression. It puts an end to Jacobs misery and gives the answers the viewers have been waiting for. But the film also raises questions, some of which lives long after the after texts ends.

This film is so awesome in every way, the soundtrack, the actors (helen hunt and dan abroad especially), the jokes, well, everything basically. I have watched this well over 50 times and I am not lying! That Woody was miscast is an absolute crime to even say. No one could have done it better. Every facial expression, muffed line and jokes that he says are to perfection. His boyish charm is so natural as is his acting. It is non acting actually because it transcends acting - it is him, his essence. Woody is the real thing my friends that is why he is so popular and so loved. I have even come to love his films that do not star himself because I finally realized that all the actors have become him in his films. He is the Beatles of comedy movies. Helen Hunt and he are excellent together! In this day and age there is no loyalty towards teams like in the 60s or 70s (just like sports nowadays). Tony Roberts and Woody were in my opinion one of the best teams and it is a shame that Helen Hunt couldn't team up more with Woody. It is so hard for me to watch Mia Farrow in his past movies now.

I can't stand them at all. They're all the same, have the same plots, the same characters (in most cases) and even the same actors. The only thing that changes in these kinds of movies is the background in which the characters live. But of course there are exceptions, such as the Hepburn\/Grant 1938 flick 'Bringing Up Baby', Woody Allen's Best Picture winner 'Annie Hall', and this movie. 'When Harry Met Sally...' is a romantic comedy that was able to be original in 1989 and remains fresh even nowadays, when most movies from this genre copy what it introduced back then.'When Harry Met Sally...' story focuses on the relationship of Harry (Billy Crystal) and Sally (Meg Ryan), covering 12 years of their lives, starting in 1977, when they met in a trip (hence the title), and ending in 1989, the year the movie was made. In these 12 years, Harry and Sally go through many phases. First they hated each other, then they became friends, until they finally realized they loved each other. The story may seem simple enough, but the script written by Nora Ephron - who even got an Oscar nomination for it - manages to tell it in a simple but yet complicated matter, a matter that holds the attention of the viewer during the whole movie. Throughout it, Ephron deals with many themes regarding love, and throws a lot of questions to the viewer, such as Can men and women be friends? and so on. The script also introduces us to concepts that were used in most of other romantic comedies to come, like the idea of both the main characters having close friends who also fall in love, the feelings that the main characters have for each other, going from hate to love during the movie, and so on. And speaking of the main characters, the character development here is nothing but marvelous, which reflects in Harry's case for example a character that starts off as a ladies' man, and finishes the movie as guy in love for his then- friend. And it's just this change in the characters that makes the movie so great, and specially, believable. Add this to some fantastic well- written dialog, and you got yourself an excellent script.There's really not much to praise in what regards the acting here. Both the main actors do a pretty good job in portraying their characters, but it's not really that stand-off job. Surprisingly, the best member of the cast is Meg Ryan, in probably the best performance of her career. She manages to deliver a very strong performance and convince as that's Sally, appealing to both men and women - like the movie itself. And she did a hell of a job in the infamous fake orgasm scene, which has got to be one of the most funny scenes ever. Like Meg Ryan, Billy Crystal also does an amazing job. In this movie, he's the guy every man wants to be. Apart from the main duo, the other two important characters are jess (Bruno Kirby) and Marie (Carrie Fisher), who do an average job.'When Harry Met Sally...' is directed by the always-great Rob Reiner. I've watched most of his movies, and although this definitely ain't his best work, all can say that Mr. Reiner did a pretty good job directing this picture. Most of the shots don't have much to them, but there are a few scenes where you can watch and say Rob Reiner certainly shot that. And the way he tells the story, interpolating Harry and Sally's story with real couples telling their love-story is a pretty good addiction to the script. I also thought the cinematography here was quite well-done, giving the feeling of New York to the viewer brilliantly.Overall, 'When Harry Met Sally...' is an excellent romantic comedy, that's able to appeal to both men and women.

Even after today this film still cracks me up for the countless of jokes from the get go.The crux of the story (yes there is one!) is the romantic dalliance between a cab driver and one time air force pilot Ted Striker (Robert Hays) who tries to reconcile with estranged girlfriend, stewardess Elaine Dickinson (Julie Hagerty). Not taking no for an answer, he follows her onboard her flight to Chicago, and in between boring passengers with flashbacks to the good ol romantic days, his lack of confidence in flight gets called upon as all the pilots get put out of action through a bout of food poisoning.And it's a tremendously busy flight with a myriad of caricatures in the passengers that do things that are plain implausible it's funny. Not only that, we also get ground crew trying to guide the plane to touchdown at the airport, and one of the inane characters Johnny, played by Stephen Stucker, responsible for many of the literal comedic and nutcase moments. And of course there are famous names attached to the film such as Lloyd Bridges, Peter Graves and even Kareem Abdul-Jabbar the basketballer, all eyes are of course on Leslie Nielsen as the doctor on board Dr. Rumack, who immortalized the line and don't call me Shirley, with his signature deadpan reaction, and who would go on following this film to make the Naked Gun series with the filmmakers here.One thing that strikes you when watching this film in retrospect, despite its comedic intent, is how lax air travel security tend to be back then, especially when cockpit visits are now totally banned. Buying a ticket at the last minute at the counter in similar fashion as what was done in the film also doesn't raise too many alarm bells, compared to what if one is to do the same today. And barging into the control tower, well I guess the rules have changed.That aside, this film may look a little dated, but the brand of comedy the Zucker brothers and Abrahams have given to the cinematic world is priceless and extremely hard to emulate, try as hard as some hacks in today's era would in choking their film with impersonators and spoofing modern pop culture, which gets so tired after a while. Even up until today the puns in Airplane! is rock solid, and will still get me, as always.

Their second film, THE WRATH OF KHAN, is one of the most successful and is widely considered by the fan community to be the best in the series. As the film opens, Admiral Kirk (Shatner) has begrudgingly accepted his new administrative role in Starfleet while Spock (Nimoy) has been given command of the Enterprise. Meanwhile, the USS Reliant searches for a suitable uninhabited planet for testing of the Genesis Project and inadvertently crosses paths with an old adversary of Kirk's, Khan Noonien Singh (Montalban). Khan soon gains control of the Reliant and uses it to pursue the Genesis device while at the same time seeking vengeance on the man he blames for the death of his wife...James Kirk. Now, with Khan on the hunt, Kirk must confront his old enemy as well as the potential life he left behind. I'll won't go into detail about that on the off chance anyone reading this hasn't yet seen the movie.The first film was incredibly somber and moody, shooting for an epic feel with it's slow pacing and it's focus on the expensive visual effects. Sure it was an interesting film, but II brings the series a little closer back to it's roots. There's much more action and the adventurous tone has returned. I'm glad it did, because this film is light years more entertaining. I never got into the original series much (I was raised on NEXT GENERATION onward) but this film is definitely one of my favorites. One reason is the film's villain Ricardo Montalban as Khan. I've never seen the first season episode Space Seed where he made his original appearance, but I'm tempted to search it out if he's anywhere as good as he is here. Montalban does insanity well, balancing tense moments of apparent control with violent outbursts. Sure, he has his campy moments but so does the rest of the film. I realize it was meant to be a serious moment for Kirk but his Khaaaaaan! as he and his away team are left trapped in the underground caverns of Regula was just too funny. I almost felt bad for laughing because I know it's supposed to be a big moment. Shatner does ham it up a bit in this film, but he's also got some real great bits. DeForest Kelley has always been my favorite original crew member as Dr. Bones McCoy and has probably got the best laughs in the film and I'm glad he was a pretty large supporting role here. On the subject of supporting characters, I'd forgotten Kirstie Alley has a rather large role as Lieutenant Saavik. She did a surprisingly good job as the Enterprise's new Vulcan first officer and I have to admit she looked great back then.The film was released in 1982, three years before I was born, but I wish I could've seen it in theaters when it was still new. I can't imagine how it must've felt watching the climactic final battle and the sacrifice made to survive (again, no details for those fresh to the series and haven't yet watched it). By now, we all knew it was merely temporary but back then fans must've been blown away at how the film ended. I imagine it had to have been on par with the I am your father moment in THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK for Star Wars fans, with jaws hitting the floor. All in all, there is a lot to love about this film and very little to hate (though I got tired of seeing recycled footage from THE MOTION PICTURE, but whatever...money saved for the production, I suppose). The second film was wildly successful, much more than the first, and solidified STAR TREK's ongoing presence on the big screen. And for that, I am thankful.

I fell in love with this movie for how great the character development was for many of the characters in the movie. I felt the pain and the joy of the characters as they went through their turmoils and victory. The two older brothers were very well developed in very short amount of scenes, where they grew from immature children into reliable men. Even though the two went through different events in order to reach this conclusion, they reached it using their Maori culture. This was great because, I was able to see the whole family (excluding Jake) as a single character who in turn returns to the Maori culture where they belong, when the family decides to go live with Beth's family. Beth was another character that was developed greatly. She started off as a uneducated woman that thought she was supposed to keep her mouth shut, and her legs open, into a independent woman that didn't need Jake anymore. My favorite character development had to be Grace. She was set up as the conscious of the family that looked after the family. I was able totally sympathize her. Even when she took her own life away I thought that her actions were justified due to what has happened to her and what results her actions brought upon her family. Over all I thought that this was a great movie, the music through out the movie was excellent as well as the non-glorified and very realistic violent scenes.

","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"20 December 2010","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Michael Mann trades Armani suits and machine guns for loincloths and tomahawks with The Last Of The Mohicans, a gloriously old fashioned romantic adventure which seems to have been embraced by a bevy of new fans, most of whom are young moviegoers hungry for popcorn thrills without the infantilism and irony of modern action movies.Owing more to the 1920 Maurice Tourneur film than the 1826 James Cooper novel upon which it is based, Mann's film offers a fairly complex portrait of Mohican\/Huron\/French\/British relations, though of course it is mostly the director's style which elevates things, Mann applying silky smooth visuals to composer Trevor Jones' evocative score and doing his best to strip his tale of as much dialogue as possible. The result is a very cinematic film, the plot told through gazes, musical swells, sudden bursts of violence and moments of unspoken passion.It also helps that the film taps strongly into very primal emotions. Essentially a large scale damsel-in-distress movie, this is the tale of sexy bare-chested men gallantly defending their woman from would be rapists. Heroes and villains thus spend this entire film racing across landscapes and fighting tooth and nail to protect or kill dames, all to ensure the survival of their kin, spread their seed and avenge the deaths of their families. It's the kind of tale you'd imagine cavemen grunted about a million years ago, before they bashed their competitors over the head and violently procured their rival's cave girl.Survival and procreation are thus Mann's key themes here, our hero yelling Stay alive! Survive! I will find you! to his woman before leaping off a cliff in a moment of alpha manliness. Elsewhere Clannad's lyrics - No matter where you go, I will find you, if it takes a thousand years - waft tenderly over the soundtrack, at once super romantic and super creepy, like a rape movie rendered tenderly.Beyond this, all the usual Michael Mann traits are here men living by strict moral codes, predator and prey dynamics, effeminate macho men, moody existentialism, an aesthetic based on paintings (the 19th century landscapes of Thomas Cole and Albert Bierstady), glossy visuals, fluid action sequences etc. But what's interesting is the way the first 2\/3rds of the film are fairly conventional, featuring relatively flat camera work, simple compositions and character interactions, only for the whole thing to slowly pull its various strands together and escalate into a super emotional third act climax. If most action movies are sex movies, complete with ejaculatory explosions and cathartic blood wounds, and if most narratives are patterned on the male sexual experience, then Mohicans is one of the classiest libidinal larks out there, one and a half hours of pent up emotions, heaving bodices, bare chests and repressed passions giving way suddenly to multiple abrupt sexual resolutions. Indeed, during the film's climax, everyone is being f**ked, men getting woman, women losing men, dads gaining daughters, daughters losing dads, whole tribes being wiped out and seeds cross-pollinating into eternity.Howard Hawks once stated that a good film need only three good scenes and no bad ones. Mohicans fits this credo to a tee, its last act climax elevating the film to some kind of action masterpiece. Of course the problem with these archetypal tales is that their archetypes don't stand up to much scrutiny, for though our Huron villain (played with subtle depth by Wes Studi) is a fairly multifaceted bad guy, the film still breaks down into easy demarcations frontiersmen good, Europe bad, Indians either savage or noble. Then there's the fact that Mohicans is not about Mohicans, Native Indians, the Seven Years War or Colonial powers, but about white people and what it means to be American.The film follows Nathaniel Poe (Daniel Day Lewis, playing it for both the ladies and male romantics), a white English orphan who is adopted by a Mohican father and son. As the film progresses, Nathaniel will fall in love with Cora, the daughter of an English General. Cora is also being pursued by a snobbish English officer, but it is Nathaniel whom she longs for. Why? Because neither culturally English nor biological Mohican, Nathaniel represents the forging of a distinctly American identity. Though at times assisting both Mohicans and the English, his primary concern is the people of the frontier. Out here they're beholden to none, he says.In short, Nathaniel is the ideal reconciliation of two paradigms the bumbling European idiocy (represented by a character called Duncan) and evil native savagery (represented by Magua, a Huron warrior), both of which want his woman. This either or\/neither nor state is best typified by the film's treatment of sex and loyalty. The Duncan character not only represents a neutered brand of romance, who hides behind formalities and appeals to friendship as a reason for marriage, but is morally righteous and gives his life in service of the crown. Magua, in contrast, is driven by personal blood-lust and is implied to be animalistic in his regard for women and mating. White man is a dog to his women, Magua says, and it is stated that his wife jumped to another man when she thought he had died, the character representing a savage take on sexuality. Nathaniel, in contrast, exists in the middle, balancing both stoic chivalry and hot passion; the passion and the soul of the Indian and the ability and the morals of the European. In this regard, he literally is the frontier, the meeting of civilisation and wilderness. Like Davey Crocket and John Wayne, he is not only the American hero, but America itself, the struggle and cohesion between civilisation and barbarism, forever on the cusp of change.And the Indians? They're just disposable scenery, their history hijacked and mowed down for tomorrow's family.8.5\/10 &#x96; Worth multiple viewings.

It's the one film I've ever seen that's genuinely scared the sh*t out of me.5 kids (Kirk, Pam, Jerry, Franklin and Sally) breaking down on a road trip doesn't sound like a very original concept, but remember this film was the first to use this formula. After about 20 minutes of setting the scene (this is long enough to build the tension but not so long the audience gets bored waiting) the real action starts.Kill #1 When they discover the house Kirk enters alone, begins to look around, but before too long Leatherface jumps out from behind a door and beats him on the head with a sledgehammer. This kill always makes me jump, although admittedly not a foot out of my chair like the first time!Kill #2 Pam goes looking for Kirk (her boyfriend) and stumbles across a room filled with human bones. She runs out of the house but is caught by Leatherface on the porch and dragged back inside, where she is impaled on a meat hook hanging from the ceiling. While she is hanging there we see Kirk's body being dismembered by a chainsaw-wielding Leatherface. This is a pretty brutal kill, and my second favourite in the film.Kill #3 Jerry goes looking for Kirk and Pam, and discovers Pam in a freezer, still alive. While Jerry is trying to comfort her Leatherface reappears behind him and he receives a blow to the head form the sledgehammer. Leatherface then locks Pam back in the freezer. This is my least favourite, because it's the one you most see coming.Kill #4 When night begins to fall Sally starts to get worried and wheels Franklin (who is in a wheelchair) towards the house. As they approach Leatherface appears out of the trees and rams a chainsaw through his chest. This is my favourite kill from the film, because of the sheer brutality of it. You see Leatherface ramming the chainsaw into Franklin's chest for about 15 seconds.Sally then runs away and a long chase ensues, lasting for most of the last 3rd of the film. In the end Sally escapes after Leatherface falls over and cuts into his leg with the chainsaw. The final scene shows Leatherface dancing manically, waving the chainsaw round in front of the sunset.The chase leading up to Sally's escape is very tense, and Leatherface's crazy dance is my favourite scene from the whole film. I love the way Leatherface isn't shown to be crazy until right at the end of the film.It is an overall brilliant film, and inspired an entire sub-genre of 'slasher' films.

Anna(Kari Sylwan, whose face is angelic) is her maidservant and intimate, loyal companion.Maria is delicate and refined, sensual and passionate, hard to resist when she makes advances towards a cautious David(Erland Josephson), Agnes' doctor, who has a desire for her yet pulls back, restraining himself. We are privy to an instance where Marie's husband was gone for the night giving her the opportunity to sleep with David, inclement weather the perfect excuse to keep him at the house so she could seduce him. Marie's husband, Joakim(Henning Moritzen), knows his wife is unfaithful; it's present in his demeanor, his eyes. As a result of her adultery, he makes a shocking decision because of the overwhelming sorrow which overtakes him.There's nothing easy(unless you're a sadist)about watching someone die a slow, agonizing death but director Bergman doesn't pull his camera away from it.

Her torture is physical--Karin's is far worse actually.Karin is a neurotic mess. She's married to a cold, unfeeling man(Georg Årlin) who dictates himself in an ordered, controlled manner, demanding for his wife to be obedient and subservient to his needs and goals. He's a self-absorbed diplomat who thinks highly of himself, his stature, his supposed importance in the Swedish bourgeoisie. We witness Karin mutilating herself with a piece of broken glass just so she could feel something; it's obvious Karen is caught in this empty void where love is far distant.Look, I perfectly understand why some have a hard time with Bergman's movies. They often deal with cruel characters who mistreat each other and say hurtful comments which come from a dark place which often result in irreparable consequences. A number of Bergman films have these characters who have buried feelings deep inside and soon there's a volcanic eruption of words announcing to their appropriate target what had remained repressed for so long. Agnes wants comfort and peace, but her sisters can not seem to offer it to her, but Anna will without fail. Anna is our emotional center for, out of the three, she's the most caring and honorable, giving all and expecting nothing in return. The other two aren't able to do so and leave the film, after a moment where they appeared to have reconnected, in the same shape they did upon their arrival to Agnes' home. As always, cinematographer Sven Nykvist delivers powerful camera shots of the faces of the principles at the most opportune times when all that lies underneath sneakily surfaces. I imagine those who have lost loved ones to cancer, especially the kind which ate at them methodically, will find CRIES AND WHISPERS to be an excruciating experience.

Eddie & Joe decide to check it out, Eddie poses as the hit-man & meets Paul Deveneux (Terry Kinney) & a striking woman named Michel Duval (Kim Basinger) who say they want a man in New Orleans killed but before any firm names or locations can be discussed Eddie & Deveneux are attacked in which Deveneux is killed & Eddie is badly injured. Across town in a hotel room Eddie's partner Joe is murdered & Michel vanishes, waking up in a hospital bed Eddie swears vengeance against those who killed Joe & travels to New Orleans to hunt down & kill those responsible starting with the mysterious Michel...Released theatrically the weekend before Christmas during 1986 this decidedly average cop thriller was directed by Richard Pearce & is a lacklustre assembly line of cop thriller clichés & predictability. The script is strictly routine, a cop's partner\/wife\/family member is killed so sets off on some renegade mission to find those responsible & extract a little revenge breaking all sorts of laws along the way & generally not acting like a cop in any way. Then there's the obligatory romance that complicates even further, there's ruthless mob boss & the local incompetent police force as our hero shoots his way across New Orleans at will. There's firm but fair police chief, the final shoot out & just about every other cop thriller cliché you can come up with. One reason why I didn't think much of No Mercy is that it takes itself extremely seriously, there's no humour here at all & most of the best action cop thrillers from this period were stuffed with one-liners & the odd gag but No Mercy is as straight & in my opinion as bland & dull as they come. The character's are dull with almost no background, the main villain in particular has no great motive & quite why he is so protective & possessive of Michel is a complete mystery apart from he gave her mum a home a few years back. Yeah right, so? Everyone in New Orleans is depicted as inbred hill billies or rich folk with black servants which I am sure they are not.No Mercy even disappoints on a mindless action level, there are a few minor car stunts, a few shoot outs & a few fights including some in a burning hotel but it's all pretty low key stuff that is generally very forgettable. There's a very minor & tame sex scene between Gere & Basinger but don't expect to see that much. The film tries to be gritty with lots of back alleys, dry ice & 80's neon lighting but the picture of New Orleans it paints is one where everyone plays the saxophone, sings, tap dances or drinks. I am quite surprised the makers didn't throw some voodoo mysticism & animal sacrifice in there too just to complete the stereotype clichés. Also, its it just me but does anyone else dislike the New Orleans architecture? All that wood is surely a fire hazard?Filmed in New Orleans & Chicago the production values are decent enough but there's no energy or pace to it, No Mercy just plods along in a predictable fashion & while I was at there watching it I lost interest & think much of it just went over my head as it failed to captivate or draw me in. The acting is alright, Gere doesn't seem suited for an action hero role while Basinger actually looks quite old in this. The underused Jeroen Krabbé has nothing to do as the bad guy.No Mercy (a generic title that has no meaning or connection to the film) is a plodding & very forgettable 80's cop thriller that quite rightly has been forgotten over the years while other cop thrillers of the time have gone on to become classics. Bland, predictable & lacking in action, I'm just glad I saw it on telly for free.

Then some actors could have been fleshed out a LOT more, such as the two eldest brothers in the family- one a sissy that learns how to fight with a stick and another one that joins a gang.

As for little brother, he still ends up as an inferiority complex wired boyscout that can swing a stick around, so much potential wasted.But other than that, I absolutely loved this film.
