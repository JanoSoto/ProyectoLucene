Story and that was nearly ten years ago. Not surprisingly, that also happens to be the last time he acted from a script which he himself had written. He was content to spend the rest of the decade embodying flat, middle of the road characters in flat, middle of the road movies (Father of the Bride parts I and II, Housesitter, The Out-of-Towners) while his creative muse sought other outlets in the theater (his play Picasso At the Lapin Agile premiered in 1993) and in the form of  humorous essays (like those collected in his new book, Pure Drivel). These last projects indicate that Martin's surreal and inventive mind has not gone dry, but he seemed to have lost his confidence in film as a forum for communicating his unusual gags and ideas. Would we ever get another original screen comedy from Steve Martin?On that score, Bowfinger is both good and bad news. The good news, of course, is that the script is a Martin original. The bad news is it's clear he has been out of the practice for too long. Or rather, perhaps, he's worked in so many plodding and monotonous comedies now that it's blunted his style. For, the actual idea behind Bowfinger is suitably off the wall (I won't summarize it here, you can read it elsewhere at this site). It's the execution of it that ends up being so uninteresting. The material here needs to be pitched at a heightened, absurdist level if it's going to work - something in the spirit of The Naked Gun or, to reference Martin's own work, The Man With Two Brains. It needs to be clear the filmmakers are aware that the plan here could never really work all kinds of practical problems are involved, from the ability to get good shots of Ramsey without proper camera and lighting setups of him, as well as the need to get him to sign a consent form - not to mention the huge script problem of working his character substantially into the story when the shots they get of him are only few and far between.Now, I can hear some people saying, But it's a comedy!  You're not supposed to think of all those very practical concerns while you're watching it. I agree - so the fact that I DID think of them tells me the film wasn't working, or I wouldn't have gotten so caught up by them. It's because it never really establishes the right *tone*, so we don't know how seriously to take these people, their dreams and desires. On one level Bowfinger is a pure cartoon, just like Martin's Jerk or Sgt. Bilko. Yet, there's just enough pathos and desperation sketched in so that we kind of think of him in more human terms - like Ed Wood, say, or Woody Allen's Broadway Danny Rose. For whatever reason, the combination just doesn't work, and leaves you with the idea that the filmmakers just couldn't decide what kind of film they were making.It doesn't help that Martin is actually pretty lame here as a performer. In fact, I don't think I've ever seen him so tired and apathetic. He valiantly tries to do an impersonation of his normal high-energy character, but it just falls flat. And when you catch performers trying to do themselves, it's a dangerous sign. I can't honestly recall one single thing he personally did or said in this movie which made me laugh. As someone who's worshipped Martin practically from the cradle, it was a pretty dispiriting experience.So should you see this movie? I dunno. It's not a bomb or anything - just kind of average. But considering how lunatic the premise is, average here seems kind of like  failure. One thing's for sure, though it contains one of Eddie Murphy's all-time greatest performances - maybe his best EVER. I'm not talking about his part as Kit Ramsey - that actually draws on the loud-mouthed, overbearing side of Murphy that I think has gotten real old and real annoying. No, it's his part as Jiff, the sweet and slow-witted Ramsey look-alike which Bowfinger uses as a body double. The look and tone he finds to portray this character are just priceless - he draws howls just from his gestures and his reactions. It's your standard geek character, but so wonderfully inhabited and underplayed that it feels totally fresh (and works better than his more hammy and obvious approach in The Nutty Professor). Is it enough to recommend the movie?  Hmmm. . . tough call. It really is a great part, yet the rest of the film does not support it very well. How about wait for a bargain night at your video store - or better yet, just catch on television when it finally airs.

The method of manipulating you in that manner is masterful.  Most of the missing scenes are actually played at the end of the movie during the credits in a manner that I am not sure whether Hitchcock would have approved of or not.

Also I don't know why so many people are slating this film, as it seems to have elements that would appeal to a wide range of viewers. Maybe these elements were so well balanced that they cancelled each other out for viewers interested in only one side of the story.I haven't seen the original so can't compare, but I think this is a very good film on its own and voted it a 9.

Like the first one, it was fast, scary, funny, and took some nice satiric jibes.  Even the much debated identity of the killer in the second one made sense as a satiric swipe at horror movies, so it didn't bother me.  I didn't know if they'd be able to keep it going for a third movie, especially when hearing Kevin Williamson's involvement was going to be minimal(he's a producer, and he wrote an outline which eventual writer Ehren Kruger worked from), but I liked the first two, I was especially pleased to see Scott Foley(from FELICITY) and Parker Posey in the cast, and I was intrigued to see what happened.  In retrospect, I probably should have waited for video.Certainly the opening shows a little promise; instead of the usual celebrity cameo, we have a spoof of that, with Cotton Weary(Liev Schrieber), who's now a Geraldo-type talk show host, complaining about having to do a cameo in STAB 3(the movie within a movie here), so we know it's spoofing itself.  The problem, of course, is we know Cotton's going to get killed, but Craven is able to draw suspense throughout the scene.  We also get the stated purpose here during the phone call(which, also a bit clever, starts out with a woman's voice before the familiar tone of Roger L. Jackson as THE voice kicks in); the killer wants to find Sidney.Sidney, of course, is living in seclusion, under a new name and barely going outside the house(which, of course, is under heavy alarm), so at first, she's almost like an afterthought to the movie.  Instead, the center is on Gail Weathers, the tabloid reporter, now an entertainment reporter, who uses her reporter skills to play detective when Cotton is killed, and she decides to assist the police, specifically Detective Kincaid(Patrick Dempsey), in the case.  Then there's Dewey, who's a technical advisor to STAB 3, the movie, and they of course worry about what's going to happen.There's all kinds of potential here, and it's directed well, but it isn't written as well as I think Williamson would have done.  There are scares which still work, and while the Dewey\/Gail relationship seems a little old hat, the two Arquettes obviously like working with each other, and their familiarity with us helps smooth that over.  Also, while Campbell is disconnected, she's still sympathetic, and while she doesn't have the same fun with herself as she did in the first one, I understood that.  And there is humor, most of it coming from Posey as the actress playing Gail in STAB 3; few actresses can make contempt funny like she can.  There's also the standard satiric bite(the bodyguard who guarded Julia Roberts and Salman Rushdie but ends up toast here).But as I said, it isn't written as well, and the primary weakness is the killer.  In some senses, I guess, having the director(Foley) be the killer makes sense, because he has the technical expertise to handle things.  But it seems to come out of nowhere, and perhaps to distract us from that, Kruger gives us the idea of him being a long-lost relative of Sidney's, which is ridiculous.  Perhaps because of that too, Foley goes way over the top, which is funny at first, but then becomes tiresome.  Also, Kruger cribs not from other horror movies here, but from the first SCREAM(the cloning of the cell phone being a prime example).  And while Williamson's red herrings were pretty clever, this one seems not thought out.  Emily Mortimer's character(she plays the actress who plays Sidney) is a perfect example; there are two indications she might be the killer(three, if you count the woman's voice to Cotton), and yet she's killed off almost as an afterthought.  Finally, as to compensate for all of this, there are a lot more killings to cover up.

It certainly has magnificent scenery and camerawork which results in some very vivid images.  While Saving Private Ryan took a view of war through the eyes of the ground troops, TRL seems to be seen through the eyes of an all seeing angry god (to put it pretentiously).  I liked the fact that the film addressed the effects of war on the natural environment and displayed interactions between the soldiers and the local wildlife (snakes, bats, alligators, dogs, etc.).  I liked that the Japanese weren't just depicted as stereotypes (although, they may have been portrayed a bit too idealistically). I liked the performances of James Caviezel (who reminds me of the young Monty Clift) and Elias Koteas, in particular.  On the down side, Sean Penn was a mass of mannerisms and gelled up hair.  Nick Nolte and John Savage overacted themselves into the realm of parody. John Travolta was extremely awkward and unconvincing as a navy admiral.  Other cameos, such as those by George Clooney, Woody Harrelson, Jared Leto, etc. were just distracting and, rather than draw you into the movie, just reminded you that it was another hollywood production.  Plus, the film never got you emotionally attached to any of the characters.  Even after seeing it a second time, I could still never identify any of the characters by name. None of the deaths were as emotionally wretching as that of the medic, Wade, in Saving Private Ryan.  The Zen philosophy of the voiceovers may have worked for one or two of the characters, but I can't believe that the majority of soldiers think like that under fire.  Overall, while the scenery is best seen on the big screen, I think the movie is easier seen on video- where you can fastforward past some of through some of the dreck and performances and get to the best moments of the film.  I'd be interested in hearing what an actual veteran of the Pacific thinks of TRL.  Overall, I must say that, despite its flaws, I think that Saving Private Ryan is still the WWII movie to beat.

Entrapment is not a bad film, but it stumbles in its romantic pairing of a crusty old man with the young and lovely Catherine Zeta-Jones. (Art imitating life here?) The plot has Zeta-Jones as insurance agent, Gin Baker pursuing master thief Robert MacDougal (Connery) after an art-heist. To get near him she poses as a thief and follows him on a heist to trap him. There are a barrage of twists in the script as to the real purposes of both characters, except after a while, they become rather tedious and predictable and by the time they are resolved, the plot has already run out of steam. As well as that, Connery's resolution not to get involved with his partners is forgotten as soon as he sees Zeta-Jones in a tight lycra suit, curving her bottom to avoid security beams. The supposedly suspenseful heists and computer disk downloads, don't really produce much tension, with the scene where the pair dangling off the World's tallest building easily the standout from a mainly mediocre lot. So what of the relationship between Connery and Zeta-Jones? Well, it has to be said that the massive age gap doesn't produce much sexual chemistry. Connery is still looking fairly good for his age and the pair's sparing certainly induce winces in the audience; in fact they do make a half-decent team. Yet one can't help thinking that Connery is really too old for action films now and should start going for character roles like Clint Eastwood and Gene Hackman are doing in their old age.

However the movie does not claim to be a biography so it cannot be marked because of this.  I gave this movie a 10 because it is so well put together. Everything from costume to set design to cinematography, editing, and directing is astounding.  The acting is also decent to great.  This movie is definitely one of the best of the 1980's.  It is a must see for any music fan as well as any fan of the great historical Dramas of Hollywood. ","genre":"Biography, Drama, History"}]
